3,"Very close-minded and racist book, HOWEVER","This book is offensively closed-minded and racist, HOWEVER having said that if you can look past the author's ""everyone outside my religion is going to hell"" statements and Nazi-like attitude of ""conversion of others is our life's mission"" there is some great wisdom that can be extracted from the book that can be tweaked to your your personal understanding of God and the Universe."
1,A Pure Waste Of Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love reading inspirational books, but this book was highly recommended by others and after reading the first section I was very disappointed. The author uses God only knows how many different versions of scriptures and how these relate to KJV (Holy Bible) with the topics being discussed I absolutely have no clue. I can't judge for everyone, but this book is great if you are Catholic (which I'm not). I'm not disrespecting this denomination by no means. I'll just stick to the KJV Holy Bible for inspiration before reading any further."
3,A Man with an Agenda,"I was very excited about Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life as I started reading it. But as I went through day by day as the instructions suggest, I found that I was not discovering my Purpose in Life, but rather being directed to attend church and be a good church member. This book is really about how to support your church--not how to find God's Purpose for YOU. If you want to learn how to be the perfect Church member, being active, supportive, loyal to the your church no matter what--being a ""servant leader"" and so forth, you will make your pastor's job much easier and certainly, if everyone in church does it, your church will become paradise. However, how you run the rest of your life is up to you!"
3,"Not a substitute for the Bible, but worth a look","I think it would be too easy to trash the Cliff's Notes feel good style of this book so I will focus on the positive elements of Warren's work. This book is easy to read, pretty well written, and does have a very importent message. I am not a big fan, but I believe that people should read this book to see what all the praise/debate is about. Having said that, this is not a substitute to the Bible."
2,Put my husband to sleep,"After reading the book, I recommended it to my husband. Even though the author comes across as extremely judgemental of others many times during the book, the overall message is extremely beneficial. My husband suggested we order these cd's of it so he could listen to it in the car, but unfortunately, it put him to sleep. He finally had to turn it off so he didn't run off the road."
4,Reading it again,"Four stars instead of five, because as great as this book is, I sometimes struggle to concentrate. But that's ok because sometimes learning isn't fun, but it is however necessary. Having said that, I saw Rick Warren on the Larry King show the other day. I had been thinking these last few days about re-reading this book, so I decided to do so. I am now about 1/2 done. There is just so much solid information and instruction in this book that I think it should be read at least twice or more. Every believer and better yet non-believer, should own this book."
3,The Purpose Driven Life,"In the Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren the author strongly emphasizes that our ""Performance"" here on Earth is a test and how we do here will determine our ""Placement"" for eternity.I am a Christian and I don't agree with that. Our physical life here on earth is just a small part of a much larger spiritual journey. Our spiritual growth and advancement continues after our physical death. Some wonderful research is being done in that area right now.I found more in a book here on Amazon called ""The Book of Thomas,"" by Daniel Aber and Gabreael that goes deep within the inner rim of the soul. It was written from an Esoteric Christian perspective as well. It dealt with issues such as The Christ Consciousness, Universal Law, The Genetic Code, The Levels of Heaven and Hell, Reincarnation, and much more."
2,"Please, a little humility","My wife and I were given this book a relative. I only made it through a couple of chapters before I gave up on it. It has way too many ""God want's this"" and ""God feel's that"" statements in it.Mr. Warren is to sure of himself as God's mouthpeice on earth.I feel that is important to be humble in one's beliefs...(But hey I could be wrong!)"
1,Beware,"This book, while on the surface appears to be a source for biblical instruction and encouragement, is to be evaluated for what it fails to address....namely important precepts such as repentance. It is also weak on sin issues. I strongly recommend that you avoid using this book as a Bible study or as a source of biblical guidance."
4,It has much passion but lacks the knock-out blow.,"Pastor Rick Warren wrote a great book that really helps any new convert to know that God has a divine purpose for every life. However, I thought it lacked application and it was more of an information book than a book written with the cross of Jesus in mind. I feel the gospel is much watered down in his book but I thank God for this book because it has created interest in young minds to know the truth of the gospel of Jesus."
3,Checking Our Moral Values,"I read this book because there was so much hype about it, and because you always learn SOMETHING from reading a book, whether you want to or not! Purpose Driven Life asks that you ""ponder"" certain thoughts. I pondered the Ten Commandmants...Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, etc.... and the more I pondered, the more I realized that if we lived by the Laws already set out, we wouldn't need this nor any other book attempting to interpret the Bible for us. I'm always concerned when preachers TELL us what God means; I'm particulary skeptical when they are arrogant enough to think their line to God is clearer and more important than our own.I cannot recommend this book, but if you wish to read it, get it from your local library. There are several ""add on"" books (workbooks etc.) by this author since the success of this one. Sincerity or profit???E. Perry"
1,"Unscriptural ""Purpose""","This book is not scripturally sound, as is especially evidenced by the fact that Rick Warren relies mainly on a paraphrased version of scripture to make his points, which is very different from what a literal translation states. In addition, most of his advice is based on human ideas instead of biblical wisdom and human ideas are generally wrong while God is always right.It's a shame that so many Christians are gravitating toward this book looking for some magical ""40 day"" formula instead of seeking the truths found only in the scriptures. I cannot recommend this book under any circumstances."
1,Overrated,"How could this book live up to the hype? The author has apparently done his research and has pulled in interesting Bible quotes, but his 40 day transformation is too simplistic."
1,self-righteous crap,"Anyone who would consider buying this would be well advised to read Sren Kierkegaard's ""How to Be a Christian"", Jean-Paul Sartre's essay ""Existentialism is a Humanism"" and Friedrich Nietzsche's ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"". If you need a book to tell you your purpose in life then those are infinitely more capable of doing so than this drivel."
1,Too much Christian content,"This interesting self-help book is unfortunately marred by an over-reliance on Christian teachings.Christians claim that the founder of their religion was the incarnation of God, and insist that anyone who dares to say otherwise will suffer eternal punishment in hell. This tends to undermine anything beneficial in what they can teach us. If the purpose of life is to discover and accept that their religious guru was God - that's not much of a purpose, is it?"
1,very dangerous,"i'm a born again christian that is filled with God's holy spirit and i've heard so much about this ""emergent church"" movement and rick warren, so i decided to read a few sentences of the book while i was in a book store and let me tell you!!! i just started getting a huge migrane headache which is very odd..... something about this book just doesnt sit well with me and i would strongly receommend against getting this book..... Jesus is really the only answer and salvation for our souls....."
3,Not exactly a review...,"I haven't read this book, but I was struck by the publisher's description, which paraphrases the author's belief that ""God planned everything and everyone"". Wait a minute - God planned the Holocaust? God planned Joseph Stalin? God planned AIDS, 9/11, the Rwandan genocide (to name but a few recent attrocities)? I wonder what God's purpose was in making millions of innocent people suffer and die prematurely. This God person (deity? supreme being? fairy tale?) sounds like a real jerk!"
1,Irrelevance,"This whole point book is irrelevant. I will save you the money and tell you what ""the"" purpose is in two words ""SERVE GOD""."
2,Don't hate it. Don't like it,"This book is pretty surface level stuff. It doesn't go in depth on single point. Although I don't disagree with most of what Rick wrote, I also think this isn't a good book for anyone but an unbeliever or a new believer. I can't understand how this book became such a phenomenon. It seems most churches are doing the Purpose Driven Life study together and while it's good for a church to do studies together, why have they chosen one without substance and meat. Something to dwell and meditate on? My suggestion for the believer who knows the basics of the Christian life and what it's about -- Don't waste your money. To the unbeliever and new believer -- You may find something in this book to start off your Christian life on the right foot."
1,"Bad stuff, I would not recommend my friends to read it.","1, `ebhedh in Hebrew (OT orignal language) always mean ""slave"" or ""servant"" and can NEVER be translated to ""friend"". But the author intentionally uses wrong translation of Bible to establish his theory on ""friendship"" with God. The author intentionally misleads readers to follow his wrong theological stand.2, It took Moses 40 years to find his purpose of life, but the author guarantees you find your purpose of life in 40 days? Many people buy/like the book because they are already enslaved by the fast-food culture.3. Christians, especially young believers, are encouraged to read good books, for example ""Celebration of Discipline"" by R.J. Foster, ""The Fight"" by John White, ""Sacrifice"" by Howard Guiness, ""Spiritual Leadership"" by Sanders, and etc."
2,Not impressed,"I have been reading the book and writing in my journal through day 8. I noticed that some of the things that are written are strictly opinion. The book had mentioned that we are to glorify God by loving other ""believers."" I don't believe that; I thought people of God were to love all people regardless if we/they are believers or not. I also disagreed with some of the worship ideas; I agree that we go to church to glorify God and to worship him; but I do believe worship is ultimately for God and for God's people; it mentioned that worship is not meant for the people. I do agree with the premise that our lives should revolve and be centered around God & that we are on Earth a short period of time versus eternity. But overall, the more I read, the more disappointed I am."
5,Life changing,found the book gave practical clear directions for purpose in life. awesome book for any age. it has me thinking about ways i need to change in my life-style to be more the person i was created to be.
1,What do you expect...parent co. publishes Satanic bible.,"I've read part of the book and some of the reviews on here. There's a lot of fluff in this book and its basically one of Zondervan's (publisher) and Warren's schemes to fill their pockets with cash. Loose scripture references are not surprising since Zondervan is the publisher of the controversial TNIV bible. Then again, I don't know why anyone is surprised that this book has major flaws when Zondervan's parent company, Harper Collins publishes the Satanic bible. Christians beware - use discernment when purchasing Zondervan products."
1,It's very easy to put this book down,"This book is just more evangelist fluff. If you love metaphors and you hate yourself, this book is perfect for you. It has nothing to do with discovering your purpose."
1,"i didn't order this, only a sample","I did not order this, I only ordered the sample. I keep getting books that I requested a sample for, but was marked as purchased. The true is of the other book that you said I ordered. You have always been great at correcting the mistakes; once I spoke to a rep, and she told me that the book should not have been read, it was only a sample. Absolutely! I would not cheat! If these books are something like 99 cents, then it's okay; I just can't afford the $12.99, etc.Thank you!"
2,Be careful,"I read this book 9 yrs ago and it helped me in my journey to finding God's forgiveness. To understadn that I was loved and wanted by God. It was a huge help throughmy process as a christian. But now that I am older and with knowledge of the importance of Faithfull Scriptures, this book may be misleading some people. be careful becuase unfortunately, the author used half thruths and misgudies with his comments"
2,Not as described,"This was actually supposed to be a gift to my mom, so I sent it to my father to give to her. I was disappointed when he told me it looked pretty worn and used. He ended up not giving it to my mom because she hates used things. I was pretty upset because I really enjoyed this book and wanted her to read it.The delivery was good (I think, I don't quite remember).I'm sure I purchased a new copy, but I might have been wrong."
1,Purpose Driven Cash Cow,"I'll tell what your life's purpose is and I won't charge you for it. You need to get Saved and bring others to Christ. The End. To gain eternal life you must look at the Ten Commandments and see yourself as a disgusting sinner in the eyes of our Holy God and realize that you need the blood of Jesus Christ to cover your sin. So repent you sinners and turn and put your trust in Jesus Christ alone for your salvation and read your bible daily, instead of this book. Now bring others to the kingdom of God by sharing the same information. That is your purpose."
1,Self help book,"A self help book for non belivers,quotes . are not scripturalWhether or not rick is confused, he certainly confuses the reader.turning to pop psychology, he has the reader looking within or looking to hurts from the past. He equates Paul's thorn to hurts from the past."
3,Purpose driven life,I have to admit when this originally came out ten years ago I was a true fan. I was in a church that was all about doing instead of being. This fit perfectly with that model. I am not saying that this is not a good book or that Rick isn't a great leader. If you are searching for your identity in Christ it can help lead you in the right direction. Just be cautious that you don't get caught up in the doing instead of the relationship.That being said the tenth anniversary edition does have some additions to it. There are video links that you are directed to through out the book. I love when authors have additional content like this. They are also audio links and an online community to help with your journey. Rick added a couple chapters as well.This is not a book really on my list of recommendations but that is probably because of the baggage I bring to the party.I was given this book by the publisher for an honest review and you did get an honest review.
3,Purpose Driven Life,I have enjoyed this book very much. I am using in my own meditation on daily basis. This book has helped me think about what am I all about.
3,Not for Godly Personal Growth through Holy Spirit,"Some of it was kind of childish, but in general I thought this was a good book on ways to understand Christianity, coincidence and to trying to find one's purpose. I would recommend ""Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect"" by Tiffany Snow as a way to get better at creating and fulfilling desires, and one's purpose, in relation to God and others, also. Also, all the books by Tommy Tenney, i.e. ""God Chasers"" series, are good, well written and enlightening. I know there are many churches who are doing good things with the ""Purpose"" books, but I would consider it more of a group/church thing than a personal getting-closer-to-Jesus thing. Try Snow, Tenney, or C.S. Lewis instead."
5,great,This book and a book called Dreams: Gateway to the True Self changed my life. I believe Amazon.com sells this book also.
1,Wow..,"I think its interesting how many white-supremacists reviewed this book. Who is it that is rating their reviews helpful??? TV Evangelists forever! Yeah! I know if I was God, I'd choose someone like Rick Warren as my messenger!"
2,You Dont have to be Jewish to Love Levy's,"The title of this review refers to an advertisemnt that used to adorn the New York City Subways back in the 1960's and 1970's. The same is true with this book. You dont have to have a relationship with God, or be Christian, or any other religion to have meaning in your life, or feel you have purpose. What is needed however, is the feeling that you are CONNECTED to all living things, human and animal, domestic, and foreign, American, or Afghani. That is the purpose of life---in a nutshell if you will."
1,Another 'pop religion' book for lemmings and sheeple!,"Folks, use common sense and logic in living your precious, finite lives. Life is short, and often unpredictable enough as it is, and you certainly don't need some fad pastor TELLING YOU his skewed version of reality and why we are here, while he rakes in the millions! The fact is, MORTAL MEN conceived of and wrote ALL religious books, tomes, and manuscripts throughout history, INCLUDING 'The Bible'. And we can't prove nor disprove the existence of a 'superior being', or 'god'. So we are ALL agnostics, and many of us don't even know it (or will admit to it!). Fortunately, LOVE, ETHICS, and MORALITY are NOT predicated on or dependent on any organized religion or other fairy tale, so take it from there. There are millions of people living 'purpose driven lives' here on Earth without organized religion, or some pastor practicing 'mind control' on you. Thanks for 'listening'!"
2,A book I didn't get,I would of loved to do a review on this book but for some reason I didn't ever get the book. If its possible you can find out why and send the book I'd be glad to do a review.
5,This Book Will Make you Rethink How You Veiw Life,"The Purpose Drive Life is a wonderful book from start to begining. I followed its prefered method of reading by doing a chapter a day. After reading the chapter, I wrote in the journal that I had bought with it. I highly recommend the journal for this book.It is simple and easy to follow, while placing YOU at the center of it and letting you examine your life the way God wanted you to. The scriptures are beautiful and the book has some very interesting question at the end of each chapter.I recommend this book to anyone that wants to look deeper into their lives."
1,what about birth defects and AIDS babies?,"Warren claims that there are no accidents, and that God plans every detail of every child. He does not even try to explain unpleasant things like severe birth defects or mental retardation. He also claims that God plans and designs everything in the world - again, he does not discuss how the bacteria that causes flesh rotting disease or the plague fits into God's plan. Or nasty animals like mosquitos, or poisonous reptiles. This book is for people who don't know or care about science and medicine. He is the Christian fundamentalist version of Depak Chopra or Wayne Dyer. Where is Voltaire when we need him?"
1,NOT NEW,"THEY HAD HIGHLIGHTED THROUGHTOUT THE BOOK, BUT IT WAASN'T WORTH THE POSTAGE TO SEND IT BACK, HOWEVER I COULDN'T GIVE AS A GIFT AFTER THAT MESS."
5,Excellent,Excellent book! I heard about this book from our Pastor at Potential Church. This book is very encouraging and stimulating to stay positive and get a better understanding why things happen the way they do from the Biblical perspective . It helps work through life issues and really motivates the reader to continue their growth and progress toward spiritual maturity through love and patience. I strongly recommend this book and hope everyone enjoys it as I did .
2,It's Okay,"I agree with the other reviews (1)I was simply written to where your 4th or 5th grader would understand (2) It is a great book for new Christians, because if you halfway go to church or read the Bible yourself..you've heard most of it before. If you really want to know what on earth you are here for...you may have to use another tool, different book or something. It was okay, but not what I expected after being so hyped by others around me. Am I missing something?"
3,"Great book for new Christians, lazy Christians","If you're actively serving in your church and participating in mission trips, then you can pass on this book. The book offers a good refresher on the Christian's responsibility and is a good roadmap for the baby Christian. More troubling, though, are the following (among many):1. Warren applies some very interesting interpretations to scripture, given his heavy reliance on The Message translation, that would seem to stretch the meanings.2. He seems to separate repentance for sin from accepting Christ as your saviour. Accepting Christ requires more than receiving and believing. You have to repent for your sins or Christ's death on the cross is of no effect.3. He never places any emphasis on tithing or the commonly accepted 10% guideline that the Bible mentions. Given how adamant he is in other parts of the book, I would have expected him to say we need to give X% back out of what we make."
2,Same old same old,I guess this is a good book if you've never heard all this before. Most of it is common sense stuff. I don't want to take away from the good intentions behind it. God bless good intentions. I got bored reading it.
2,Just Not Enough There,"Mr. Warren's guide might be perfect for those who are friendly to, yet not acquainted with Christianity. If you having more than a passing knowledge then, nothing in this book will come as a great surprise to you. I bought this book with a great deal of hope that it would provide some interesting insights into life. However, it became merely a rote recitation of platitudes (true nonetheless) that God created me and I exist to worship and praise him in all that I do - or, a reworking over a few hundred pages of the first line from the Baltimore Catechism. I suggest instead a more challenging read, such as Augustine's ""Confessions,"" Kempis' ""Imitation of Christ,"" the Book of Job (perhaps Tolkien's translation from the Jerusalem Bible), or even the ""noble pagan"" Epictetus' Enchiridion."
1,"R Warren is on earth to make lot of $$$'s, OverRated Book!","Simply Overrated, Irrational and worthless!.This book/cd is waste of time for everyone. After hearing all CD's, I realised how much time I have wasted on hearing something which is generic and of no direction.After spending 2 days on this, when I sat down to think about what I learned from this book/cd, I realised Rick Warren sold me some 'worthless talk'.I am not sure but if you are looking to get some advise/direction on life, don't waste money and just scan the book at borders and I am sure you will not buy it.I shared this with my family and friends and everyone found it useless and with simple generic talk.I bought this worthless CD at borders for $24 and now selling it on ebay for half the cost !."
1,"The new ""Pet Rock""","Saccharine sweet. I was given this book by my mother in law who raved about it. It is not that the book is bad or poorly written, but is obviousley catering to people who need to be told what to think. I found reading it a waste of time."
1,Conflicting Messages,"I received this book from an ex-friend bent on bringing back tothe fold of Christianty.Well her mission failed.The mostobvious flaw is Warren's inability to come to the conclusion ifwe have free will or if we are driven by fate which controllsus beyond our will.We have free will to come to Christ/Godbut somehow we are given an array of attached experiences whichdrive us to God and his 'plan' for us.Sound confusing? Yes,andso is Warren because he sits on the fence between free will androbotic controll from above.I found the book to be depressing,because it leads to nowhere and the arguement goes around in circles.Another troubling thing about the book isthe feeling that you are the center of the universe and all other people bounce off of you so you can have your experience.Sounds new age almost.To make a long story short Warrencomes across as someone who uses subjective fluffy 'feel good'thinking and tries to make it an objective reality for all people,just doesn't work."
1,Missed Opportunity,"What a disappointment. May I suggest the lessons Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew: 5) as a guide for a life of purpose. Surely that is what Christian authors and leaders MUST teach (but aren't) in our culture of greed, individualism, militarism and nationalism. PDL ends up being another how-to book that the masses latch onto because of the marketing and hype. How sad."
5,An excellent book,"I really appreciate the way it explains God's purpose for us in our life. I don't think you need literal translations to understand the points that are being made. There is only one infallible, so approach this one with the same cautiousness as you would with anything. Take from it what you can...let God speak to you specifically through the book. It's not going to have the same magic formula for everyone."
1,"full of false humility, downright wrong; read the bible, not this book","The book is so bad I don't know how to start. I'm deeply disappointed.The verses are taken to support the thoughts of the author (which are out of line), not the other way around (look at them insightfully to reflect what they mean).Consequently, the conclusions are wrong and the logic is empty.This is not how to teach people or help them learn.The book is full of false humility and false love.The book also doesn't help to find one's life purpose.Reading this book is a waste of time, a conversation heard in vain.Read/Listen to someone like Joyce Meyer instead.You will learn much more, sharpen your insight, and you will begin to have effective prayers (if you didn't already have) and have a happy relationship with God."
2,same 'ol rehash,"I was real excited to get involved in the small-group program that was going around in conjunction with this book. However, after about the first two chapters I had about enough. I would think that the primary target of The Purpose-Driven Life is those new to the faith; and that's ok. But the sheves are bulging with material if this is your case. I found it to be the same 'ol rehash. Although I respect the frequent quotes of C.S. Lewis there was virtualy nothing to challenge my faith. I would instead recommend Phil Yancy or Larry Crabb."
5,Purpose-Driven Life - for Commuters: What on Earth Am I Here for?,"My husband and I listen while commuting, it is great because we have time to discuss pertinent points -- together. It is very educational and we are enjoying the quality time together."
3,Interesting Read,"I purchased this book on the advise of a co-worker and am about half-way through the book. Reading a chapter a day, as it suggests, does make it easier to absorb what you are reading and have the time to think about what you've read.I find it interesting. I have just recently starting on my spiritual journey to discover my place on God's earth. Everyone says that what you get from reading the bible or other materials about it, is that person's interpretation of what they think it means. This book is a great example of that. He takes all these quotes, scriptures, whatever from numerous books and puts it how he thinks it should be.I am in no way in any position to say he's right or wrong. That's exactly why I'm reading the book. I am enjoying reading it and am learning things I didn't know before. It's definately worth the read."
5,Great book,"This is a great book. Everyone should read this book and remember what is truly important in life. All of our choices have eternal consequences. Live for God, live for eternity. This is a book to keep and read over and over again."
1,I wish there was a minus 5 stars..,"I , for the life of me , can not believe logical , thinking people believe this .. for want of a better word, crap.... The very first pages talk about Gods purpose on our lives.... Really... ? When I read that I visualized the small child who had its picture taken in Africa... you know the one where there's a vulture waiting about 20 feet away...waiting... (Guess for that child to die)... God didn't want that vulture to go hungry that day.What a wonderful purpose God had for that small child.. And please , you ""Christians "" that will read this ... don't give me ""free will"" , or rain falls on all people... I almost barfed reading those words of the wonderful Pastor Warren.... Shame on all of you ... thinking you are special in the Lords eyes.... Give me a break... Grow up and start thinking. There is no God... Pictures are way worth more than this crap of a book.. 30 million sold? Just shows me there's 30 million fools out there."
3,Okaaay,"Started the book, decided to go directly to the source Jehovah God's word, The Bible.Gave the book to the Salvation Army."
3,Really?,"The product itself is awesome, meaning the book. The Kindle Edition product has some false advertisement. The page numbers are not accurate /exact and the audio is not available on the 1st edition kindle; therefore the enhanced features are unavailable and irrelevant."
3,Very good purchase,This copy of Purpose Driven Life was purhased to be given away. The book was in very good condition. My friend was happy to receive thise book and I was happy to be able to give it to her. Thank you.
4,Inspiring book,"A very inspiring read. I recommend it to everyone who wants to be judged a caring, and good person.Read a chapter a day for the recommended 40 days and change your life."
4,The Purpose Driven Life,"There's a lot of good, sensible advice in this book. It's easy, common sense reading. I liked it. Would recommend."
1,Rick Warren is a Media Pimp,"Rick Warren's updated version of ""The Purpose Driven Life"" is nothing more then a catalog for all of his other ""accessories."" I am not going to a website everyday just to receive a mantra or ""thought for the day"". Within the first two or three pages of text, he basically starts his ""product placements"". He is just a snake oil salesman in an electronic world. ""What On Earth Am I Here For? Not to line Rick Warren's pockets-that's for sure."
2,Shallow and Unbiblical,This book is shallow and unbiblical. While its written in an easy to understand language the content is very shallow. Stay away from this book!
1,It really helps,...if you have a stash of crystal meth while reading it. It really helps getting over the existentialism.
1,I threw out my copy today.,"Why? Because Rick Warren has decided that his own beliefs should trump anyone else's. I say this because he's decided to get involved and speak out on the Terri Schiavo case, and he can see nothing but ideology. He lied about this woman's condition on two TV news shows, he fails to understand or doesn't want to understand the truth about this, and I refuse to accept any comfort from a man who would do so much harm to another, namely Michael Schiavo, who is only trying to grant the last wish of his wife."
1,Great book...,"...for a fundie who wants to feel comfy. It all comes to this:Warren: -My religion is bestest, my holy book doesn't lie and jesus is saviorGuy: -oh ok, but look at those god's laws you discard...W: -SHHH, Surrendered people obey god's words even if they doesn't make sense!G: -but seriously, read this fragment of the bible, it's stupid....W: -SILENCE DEVIL, I WON'T LISTEN!G: -but look at evidence, history of your relig...W: -LALALALAL NOT LISTENING YOU SATAN, BEGONE, BEGONE!Warren is trying to sound very scientific at times, but in the same time he bash science for not obeying his god.For me, it's extremely sad book, showing what fundamentalism in faith can do to human being and I just can't understand how it can uplift or give purpose to anybody, even devoted Christians.My opinion, ask yourself why are you here instead of looking somewhere else. Worthless book, stay away."
5,A guide to a successful life what a book,"The best of the best. It's really useful, insightful and an eye opener l recommend this book to anyone who needs"
4,Relevant to the Christian family,"This book touched us deeply. It has an important message of hope and understanding, written in tender and sympathetic style."
1,So what is the pupose?,"All I ever see from christians is rabid hatred, intolerance, and opposition to those who do not believe EXACTLY as they do. Put this down and pick up some Shakespeare. You'll be smarter for it in the end."
1,NOT Godly,"This guy who calls himself a spiritual leader is NOT ""Godly"". He actually says in his book, 'you should love Christians MORE than other people""! Shame on you."
5,A Book To Treasure Your Whole Life,"There are a lot of great books. And then there are those special books that are beyond great--books that you will treasure throughout your life. The Purpose Driven Life is one of those kind of books. It's the kind of book you will read several times, the pages will begin to wear, and then you'll have to replace your personal copy. It's the kind of book you will give as a gift to your friends and loved ones. It is the kind of book you will dip into--almost like scripture--to find inspiration when the going gets tough.Warren is not esoteric--he is plain spoken and his messages are clear. And that is what makes this book great.Rick Warren's wonderful book is a life changing masterwork!Another life changing book isChristmas Gifts, Christmas Voices. This book increased my faith in an afterlife and instilled in me a stronger desire to serve others."
4,It's time to start giving,"Some things that jumped out at me from this book are Warren's obvious care for his readers and his love and devotion to Jesus the Christ. Also, I noticed while reading this is that Warren personifies God by saying, ""God hates..."" or ""God wants..."" and this is unnacceptable to me. God is not a person- God is beyond our reckoning and with this I can't seem to read the rest of the book ( a lot of good stuff) without doubting Mr. Warren's thought pattern. Besides all that- most of this book is good- people need to know that they have a purpose in life. Without purpose, people are... purposeless."
2,Missing key points of Christian living,"This book is meant for people who has just started seeking and is just average. Here the author hasn't done any justice in emphasizing about the most important factor which is 'GRACE'. He just brushes past it and has not done any justice on that topic. Let the Holy Bible be our reference from which we understand God. One book I will recommend after the Holy Bible is the book by Dr. James Richards called "" Grace: the power to change"". It will help us in seeing how we are still trying to cling on to our own abilities and how we still fail. Must read for saved Christians.The Holy Spirit will definitely reveal to our hearts the truth if you read the Bible submitting yourself to Christ and not to your own abilities. We should always remember one thing, we are no longer under law but under grace.Amazed by his Grace!"
2,Paraphrasing: Tread Lightly Reading The Book,"I had a problem with reading Rick Warren's paraphrasing. It took away from the context. I had to look in the appendix for the reference scriptures find them then discern if the paraphrase was correct. Once I did that it was hard to focus. Flipping back and forth is enough and then to have to look in the Bible for the true verse was irritating and distracting.I can say that this book taught me more about discernment, the Bible and paraphrases, and how to interpret what information is relevant to me.To all readers, tread lightly in reading this book. If you totally get caught up in the book and do not discern or reference the Bible, you may be misinformed.This is good awakening tool as for studying the Bible and determinining what messages to follow in life."
1,Understand the Intent but,"I think I understand the intent behind what he was wanting to do, but this is not something I would recommend for anyone. This seems more of a self help light book instead of helping individuals understand who God is and what there response should be to Him.The Bible needs to be the supreme authority within every Christians life. It is not a self help book, but the inspired Word of God that reveals who He is and who were are in comparison. Wanting to glorify God in this life is great and will look different from person to person but it needs to be driven and grounded on the truth of Scripture. Scripture reveals that our purpose is through the penal substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and Warren doesn't have that as the foundation of this book.It's not heretical but just not a solid book to spend time reading. There are other books that I would suggest picking over this one up. One is ""Don't Waste your Life"" - John Piper or ""A Quest For More"" - Paul David Tripp"
2,"UPON A CLOSER LOOK: only two stars, not four...","After looking over this book more closely and its watered-downmessage of ""the popular gospel"" and ""the people-drivenchurch,"" - I have downgraded my original rating from4 stars to 2. I think, frankly, that Rick Warren and RobertSchuller are into the ""success in ministry"" thing clearup past their eyebrows. The Gospel was NEVER a popularroute for the world or the worldly.Many preachers and cheerleaders seem to have forgottenthat fact. What ever happened to old fashion REPENTANCEfrom sin, HOLINESS, and sanctification? - not very popular,huh? maybe with Man. but with GOD it has never gone out ofstyle. Selah.Missionary/Pastor Len Hummel"
5,Life really does have meaning,This book shows us all that life is all about a few simple but super-charged life changing principles that God designed us to live by. Want meaning? Want purpose? Not sure why you;re here on the planet?....Get this book and the questions will be answered.
3,Try the book... we can learn together,I purchased the book and have committed 40 days to it. If you'd like to learn along with me... visit my blog and let's do this together: http://purposedrivenlife40days.blogspot.com/
5,"How to fully live your life, Amen!","The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren is one of the hottest non-fiction books of the past four years. The third time is the charm for me; I tried reading through the book twice before finishing it this time. Sometimes this book was hard to read, mostly for the guilt it evinced in me about how I don't spend enough time worshiping God or about my lack of devotion to my church. Throughout the course of reading this book, I've kept a journal and looking back I can see the ways that God has used this book and the questions it's raised in me to answer questions about my purpose in life. This really is a book that if everyone read it could change the world for the better. Warren backs up all of his suggestions with Scripture, and I really admire the way he is able to get to the essentials of what we need to be doing in our lives. This is not a prosperity teaching; it's about realizing what you were made to do on this earth so you can live fully."
5,Purpose Driven Life,This is a Life-Changing book and I believe that everyone should read it. You will become crystal clear on your purpose for being here and have a clear understanding of God's plan for our lives. I have given this book to my children and have recommended it to friends. I also did a book study with my on-line prayer list based on each of our understandings of the teachings of Rick Warren. Fabulous and a Closer Walk with Jesus.
3,Looking for Inspiration,"I first learned of this book by way of the news story involving Ashley Smith and Atlanta courthouse gunman Brian Nichols. After reading it I was puzzled that the book, although well written, did absolutely nothing for me. Recalling that Ms. Smith fed Mr. Nichols pancakes, I decided to recreate, best I could, the ""set and setting"" of the reading experience. So each morning for a month, I re.read the text, accompanied by a plate of blueberry pancakes. Still nothing! Now, with this latest revelation of methamphatamine use during Ms. Smith's reading sessions, I don't know *what* to think. Will I need to combine pancakes *and* street drugs with my reading to get my money's worth from this book?"
2,more of a group thing than a getting-closer-to Jesus thing,"For a Group, Yes, but Not for Godly Personal Growth January 8, 2004Some of it was kind of childish, but in general I thought this was a good book on ways to understand Christianity, coincidence and to trying to find one's purpose. I would recommend ""Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect"" by Tiffany Snow as a way to get better at creating and fulfilling desires, and one's purpose, in relation to God and others, also. Also, all the books by Tommy Tenney, i.e. ""God Chasers"" series, are good, well written and enlightening. I know there are many churches who are doing good things with the ""Purpose"" books, but I would consider it more of a group/church thing than a personal getting-closer-to-Jesus thing. Try Snow, Tenney, or C.S. Lewis instead."
2,Didn't Like It,"When it comes to Purpose Driven Life, there seem to be two kinds of readers. Either you love, love, love it and consider it to be the greatest book since the Bible or you hated it. I, alas, belong to the second group. I didn't want to hate it but there's so little substance here, it's shocking.The book is dull, repetitive, and comes off like a slick piece of marketing. It also seems to have been written for people possesing only 8th grade reading skills. I resented being constantly urged in every other chapter to read (buy) Rick Warren's other books. Purpose Driven Life looks impressive at first glance but when you read it, it's just another self help book. Whether it sticks around on the Christian market as a perpetual favorite or whether it becomes the new Prayer of Jabez (a fad) remains to be seen but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype."
1,Good Spiritual Food,"Are you seeking answers to questions that have been teasing you for a long time, about your purpose here on earth. Read this book and get good food for your soul. Spiritual nourishment that will set you on the right path."
3,Matt 7:1,"What I find incredible is that for alot of the critics there is alot of judgements being made. Whether you agree or disagree with Rick Warren (I am in the process of reading the book), stating that those who disagree are in prison or mental institutions and that those who agree are weak-minded is for God...NOT MAN!! State your facts, based on the Word of God, and be done with it. MAY THE LORD GOD BLESS YOU REAL GOOD!!!!The rating is only because I was required to do so."
5,The Purpose Driven Life,"How important am I in life? In Gods eyes, you are #1. Remeber, God made you in his image and likeness so what else would you be but #1.Now if you are a devil worshipper, you are #2 and we all know what #2 stands for don't we???"
2,"More ""Blink"" than ""Real Think""","As a Christian who is a devotee of C.S. Lewis among other fine Christian writers, I found ""Purpose Driven Life"" more ""Blink"" than ""Real Think."" Because it lacked theological and literary substance, it is the sort of book that one can read and think about without really thinking. In a word, it is pabulum, or, in St. Paul's words, ""milk."" I would hope that Rick Warren's next book will feed Jesus' sheep with something more substantial."
1,"Christian, here's your purpose -- Matthew 28:19-20","This book was highly recommended to me by a cashier at a local store. But after reading many of the reviews here -- I'll pass, simple as that. However, I do find it ""interesting"" that more and more folks calling themselves ""Christians"" feel compelled to buy books that make them feel more like something they're not. Think about it...and if you're truly a child of God you'll want more than anything else to read the only book you'll ever need -- it's called, 'The Holy Bible'.""It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man."" (Psalm 118:8)""That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."" (1 Corinthians 2:5)"
3,Interesting Read,"I'm not going to write a lengthy review, as there are certainly plenty of those here. I believe Warren's motive was to inspire Christians to really get into their walk with the Lord, instead of sitting on the sidelines waiting for heaven. In that regard, he does a good job. My problem with the book, though, is his generous use of ""paraphrases"" of the Bible (such as The Message) instead of relying on accurate *translations* such as the NASB. You CANNOT trust paraphrases, ESPECIALLY ""The Message"". I believe the trap Warren has fallen into is to try to use the scriptures to prove his preconceptions, instead of relying on the scriptures to *shape* his viewpoint. That is the classic cart-before-horse scenario."
4,Good but needs more in depth Scriptural backing,"This is a great book, and it is exciting to see an Evangelical book doing so well on Amazon. But it is a tad formulaic and veers towards relying on the method rather than on the power of the Cross. You will find John MacArthur, or Martyn Lloyd-Jones, much better as guides for how a church can grow. However, if you want a really easy to read book that will transform your life, go for the SUPERB book by Carolyn Custis James, WHEN LIFE AND BELIEF COLLIDE. Now if only THAT book could sell as well as Rick Warren, then American Evangelicalism would be in a MUCH better spot!"
5,Essential,"Other than the Bible, this is the most important book you will ever read.If your heart is beating, whether you are a believer or not, the questionsand issues raised in this important work will strike a cord or at the minimum induce serious introspection about the big questions in life.Pastor Rick has a way of addressing complex and large issues in a strikingly clear and simple manner. I am reading it for the 10th time or so and continue to derive benefits. Despite what you have heard this is not the typical success manual or preachy. If I had only read this as a young boy, my life would have been different. This is like discovering a gold mine. It will explain and make sense of so much in life. Its a must read."
3,New Christian,"As a new Christian, this book left me with a lot of questions?The book is intended for those who are secure in their walk with the LORD! Although this book is easy to read & follow, it left me feeling confused. The chapters seemed to contradict one another? I feel this book will serve as a growing tool for many, but at this early time in my walk with the Lord, I feel its too much to ponder on!"
5,'Precious Jewels from a Deep Mine',"Although my favorite spiritual self-help book is 'With Joseph in the University of Adversity: the Mizraim Principles', by J. Parks, this one certainly ranks among the two or three best ever written. Warren is excellent in every area of applying theology to our everyday life, and his organization is the key to making it all work! The theology is scholarly, yet easy to digest, and will not leave the reader unsatisfied. Warren is doctrinaly sound and personal in his approach. If you're looking for systematic theology for an everyday devotional, this one is the very best. If you want sound principles for everyday life that you or a graduate can use, go with Parks (if you can find a copy). Both of these are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Also recommended: 'With Joseph in the University of Adversity: the Mizraim Principles' 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'"
3,Awesome Book,Read it years ago and just purchased the revised one. Can't put it down. Rick Warren seems like a cult leader. Scarey.
5,priceless,"having read this publication before, and benefitted from what cousel I received, I ordered two copies for my grandson and his fiancee to study together. They, too, are benefitting for a shared direction in their lives together. I cannot praise it enough for the introspection it leads one into."
2,"Book is Good,Not Excellent","12/25/03 As I browsed through Rick Warren's ""The Purpose Driven Life"" ,I was inspired more often from ""direct biblical quotes"" than by the interpretations by author Warren of the quotes..there were a few instances of ""food for thought"" but based on the book being 337 pages the number of instances was not high enough in my opinion to rate it in a higher percentile."
2,"Too much fear and dogma, not enough soul and reality","This book seeks to create more of a follower, rather than someone that can connect to God in their own personal way, without a church attached to it.It doesn't help people with everyday challenges, but preaches. It doesn't address the problems of Christian women beaten by their husbands, and what to do if there is incest in a family. If anything it brings more fear upon a person that might want to leave, but be afraid to break vows they made before an alter.It's great to worship the Lord, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. It just doesn't do much to help people find their own personal connection, and that is what's needed most."
1,This is a travesty - its not the gospel,"A Church of 15,000 people is an oxymoron. The writer speaks about an extremely self centered view of the gospel. Although he says in the beginning its not about you he goes on to tell how you will go to heaven how you will find all kinds of good stuff in the Church to make you feel good. Where is sacrafice or did Jesus not die a sacraficial death. It is sad that this has become a best seller but then that was its purpose to make money for its author."
5,The Purpose Driven Life,"WONDERFUL BOOK! I have used it as gifts for others and will continue to do so! BUY THIS BOOK, it is a MUST on your bookshelf, second only to your Bible!"
2,Right Question - Wrong/Vugue Answer!,The book has asked the right question. It is true why the intelligent human being in on earth... what for...Eat... reproduce and die...Life is too short as compared to the life of universe..Life has should have purpose...Am I born to grow... get loan from bank for the necessity of life and rest of life is dedicated to return the money...This is not fair...Where is the answer?Let me say not . only Christianity... Why not see other religion... I find more convincing answer in other religion such as Islam...
4,Haves and Have Nots,"I haven't read the book yet but know the principles behind it. But I wonder why an egotistical jerk like Donald Trump can be given so much while others have so little. Where's the justice? Still, any book that provokes people to get closer to God has to help our society become more civilized."
1,Useless ear candles,"I have been using candles bought at a local healthstore for some time, with good results every time. However, using these candles I would have thought that there was no wax in my ears at all. I even interspersed using these candles with the ones from the local healthstore...each time TC Natural's candles produced nothing, but the others did.In a nutshell, don't waste your money."
2,Dried mango,"Yuck, very dry and stick to your teeth, taste a little stale. I'll try them in recipes and see it that's any better."
5,Healthy and tasty,It's healthy and tasty without any sugar added. You would like it if you don't mind chewy food.
3,A bit like leather,"The flavor of this is good, but the consistency, not so good. You won't be disappointed if you put this on your cereal, but to eat a handful? Probably not. It will take a long time to get through this pack"
2,DRied Mangos,"The mangos are small, dry, and don't taste ripened.The small rectangular pieces will cut up your mouth. But You get what you pay for."
1,Too hard to be edible,"I like the idea that it is organic. However, this is too hard. When they say dried, they mean dried out. The flavor is not that great either, although I can deal with that alot better than it being cooked too long. I tried giving these things away. Everyone ends up throwing them away. For me, it was not worth the sale price that I paid for them."
3,I wish I tried them before buying so many,"They seem healthy because they're unsweetened, but they could really ise some sweetening. Some people like tham, but I think they taste a little like cardboard. I suggest buying a single bag that is this brand at your grocery store before buying so many online."
1,These mangoes taste awful and smell even worse,I opened the first package all excited. It tasted awful. And then I got a whiff of it - it smells even worse. I am returning this.
1,NO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT,"If you like the taste of sweet stale cardboard, this is for you. If you like the aroma of 'fake' mangos, this is for you.The pieces in every bag are all less than the size of a corn flake (like the cereal). Each bag has about 100 pieces in it (not counting the dust at the bottom of the bag...). You end up chewing one piece for several minutes before you just give up and spit it out."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"this was the worst tasting dried mangos i have ever ate. they were so dry that it hurts my teeth trying to bite through them. it seems like they packaged the worst part of the mango pieces (like the skin or pieces near the core/seed). in each pack, only 10% of the mango pieces were actually good, all the rest i had to throw away because i just couldn't eat them. now i still have about a full case with no one wanting to eat them."
3,Leather like consistancy but real mango taste,"At first I was really unhappy with the leathery consistancy. It was difficult to chew and stuck in my teeth. However I have to say that after finishing the first bag I'm hooked. It has a really great mango taste. If you don't like to eat fresh sliced mango's you won't like this but if you do it makes a great snack that is portable (I keep in my desk at work, in the car and in my purse) and it is very WW friendly."
1,Lakota Piano,I have tried to listen to Lakota Piano but it would not open for me on line in the listening review. I enjoyed Nicoles Passion Spirit and would like to hear more of the same type of music.
2,not what I expected,"This is not what I expected....expected some new direction, all I got was""pop"" cliches alla Andrew Lloyd Weber....if you love show tunes, you'll love thisnew Liturgical worship music...."
3,a good Bible,"I purchased this Bible because of the wide margins as I love to take notes and add additional ideas. The pages, however, are thin and my ink bleeds through. There are no references or notes as a study Bible might have."
2,I guess I got a bad one,"I was very disappointed with this bible. The binding was loose, the paper creases with every grasp. I could'nt believe the poor quality. The only reason I give it 2 stars is that I like the wide margins and the single column format. This bonded leather bible is very poorly made. I wonder if the glowing reviews that I read were about the hardcover version. Mine is poor and dissapointing."
2,Great format but the binding is very bad,"After looking around for a good note taking bible in NASB, I came across this one. The reviews looked good so I ordered the hardcover version. Amazon did their thing well and the bible looked great. The margins are just right at 1.5 inches. There are even some very nice full color maps in the back.UNFORTUNATELY, after 3 months of using the bible during studies and transferring some of my notes from other bibles, the binding started to fall apart. Last Sunday I had about 15 pages from the map section fall out under the pew.Since I have done so much transferring of notes, I am looking into have it rebound.After reading all the reviews again, it looks like both the leather and hardcovers have bad bindings. You might want to look at products. NASB is hard to find in wide margin! Good hunting."
4,Hefty bible but lots of writing space,"I view this bible as a bible and journal wrapped up in one so the size is ok. The only thing is that within 3-4 days of using this bible the maps in the back began to come loose and now, a week or two later are completely out. The binding on the bible pages looks pretty secure. Hopefully it stays that way."
5,Wonderful Bible Study Tool,I love the wide margin NASB bible. NASB is my favorite bible version and the space that the margins allow for note taking is wonderful.
3,Paper too thin,"All as appears on Amazon etc, but unfortunately in reality there is some read-through of the text on the other side of the sheet."
2,Wide Margin Bible Review,"The margins were just what I wanted. They provide the space for me to make my own notes. The page paper is a bit thin but I knew that before making the purchase.Within the first month of owning and using the Bible the maps in the back fell out. The binding failed as to them. I was trying to take excellent care of the book and binding from the beginning so this was very disappointing. I did not store papers in the book, broke in the binding as directed and even put a protective cover on the book. The binding is just not sufficient for the size and weight of the book. This is disappointing.Due the binding problem I would not repurchase this model."
3,Turn of the last Century Occult Thriller,"If you can get past the casual racism, anti-Semitism, turn of the last century British snobbery, shallow character development, and over simple storytelling this turns out to be an amusing quick read about three cads who obtain mysterious occult powers from a sinister force from Atlantis."
1,The Sorcery Club,I did not find this book interesting. I only read the first chapter and I was bored and confused. This is not a book for me.
5,Hooray More Pegs!,Nothing is more disappointing then running out of a certain color in the middle of a lite brite project. These are great to have around to prevent just that problem. I'd recommend gettingLite Brite All-Paper Refill Setto go along with them too.
2,Didn't work for me..,"My older grandchildren passed down an older version of the LIte Brite to their younger cousins. I ordered these pegs as well as some refill pages. The pegs did not fit in the holes properly and were continuously falling out. It was misery. Also--FYI--with any Lite Brite--you need tons of pegs--there weren't enough of these to even finish 1 small picture--had to use alternate colors. Will need to find some ""old"" pegs."
2,Not like it used to be made!,"I bought a Lite Brite for my 6 yr old daughter. I had a lite brite growing up and remember playing with it a lot. Times have changed the make of this product greatly and not for the better. First the light in it hardly lights up the pegs, the pegs are very hard to push in and pull back out (so much so that my daughter gets very frustrated with it), the lite brite itself is half the size they used to be, and the peg holder on the bottom does not open and close very easily. My daughter doesn't seem overly interested in playing with the lite brite much. Don't waste your money."
4,"More than worth the ""add-on"" price!","Purchased this paper weight for our office gift exchange party and the ladies fought over it! The diamond is very large, hefty, and very good quality. The only complaint I had was the logo had a scratch or indent going through it like a sharp edge ran across it. Not that big of a deal, but makes me think the logo will not hold up if it's handled too much. Other than that, the price was great when Amazon had this as an ""add-on"" item. Would love to see this come back as an add-on item again!"
5,Review by professional coach who works with grief...,"This is an excellent grief resource that provides a solid roadmap to go along with the book. The activities are meaningful and help one who has recently suffered a loss go through the grieving process faster.You will get the most benefit if you read the book and do the activities provided in this workbook. However, you could work with each of these separately.TheThe Grief Recovery Handbook : The Action Program for Moving Beyond Death Divorce, and Other Lossesis also quite popular and geared toward losses of all types. This book is strongly focused on a recent loss, but will be useful to anyone who is grieving the death of a loved one."
4,Priceless where and when you need it,I purchased this tool to fix a little problem I was having while remodeling my basement. When attempting to sister up new 2x4s to old 2x4s my drill would cam out using both square drive and Phillips bits. My friends and I joked that the old wood was petrified. As I already have a host of other 18 volt DeWalt tools I got this one to match (two new batteries are nice to add to the rotation too). The impact driver drove the 2.5 and 3 inch screws home with no problem.I love this tool. It works where I need it.That said please note that I do not/can not use this tool for basic drilling needs. It does not have enough power to be used for most automotive tasks as it has only 98 ft lbs force and most pneumatics have 300-700 ft lbs force. Also note that with no clutch (which it should not have) you should not attempt to use this for finish wood work.
4,A fine overview of Spanish culture,"Having made our reservations to travel to Spain, my wife and I set out to do some background study. Of several currently popular sources, I found ""The New Spaniards"" to be the most helpful overview of both history and of culture. Many Americans are generally familiar with the outlines of Spain's glorious past. We were seeking to know more of its present, beginning with the Franco era and including snapshots of its current culture. This book is well-suited to those of us who are interested in Spain's regions and the region-Madrid(national) tensions, the role of the press and modern social science poll results. These latter statistics are conversationally presented and by no means overwhelm the reader: rather, they give good understanding and form the basis for conversations with Spanish friends one might make along the way."
5,Fascinating book for a tourist,I enjoyed my 10 day trip to Spain so much more because of having read this book before I went. Spain came out of a dictatorship in 1977; the time spent under it and the process of coming out of it is a fascinating story. This book gives entertaining and thoughtful insight into the Spainish peopele and their culture from many angles. It should also be listed along with the travel selection of books.
5,Well organized dissemination of information,"I have traveled to Spain twice in recent years and am very curious about the country and its people. I have found this book to be a valuable resource to my understanding of Spanish history, its people and culture. The amount of information in this 400+ page book would be overwhelming if it weren't so well organized. Hooper gives us useful chapter divisions and chapters that are just the right length. This is particularly helpful if you are looking for information on a specific aspect of life in Spain. I have purchased a few other books on Spain and this one is the most useful and enjoyable, by far. My one quible would be the relative scarcity of visual graphics, photos and illustrations. Otherwise it is an excellent read."
4,Great Product,The product is very powerful and very easy to use. I would have given it a 5 star review except for the periodic validation requirement.Another problem is you can only run it on one of your machines. If you want to run it on another computer you have to buy a second license. I have a laptop that I use for video editing while traveling. To buy a second license for that is absurd.
4,Really a good recording with one exception,"Ray Wylie's recording of (mostly) other people's music is a lot better than I expected. I guess I'm still shaking my head over those 70's albums made by Billy Joe Shaver and Guy Clark when their record companies had them record song they didn't write themselves. But this time, it works and it works outstandingly well.The one exception is the James McMurtry song at the end. Like a lot of JMcM's stuff, it begins with a good foundation, then quickly goes to hell and then keeps on going well past the point of being an embarassment. ""Choctaw Bingo"" is the longest cut on the recording. It's also unfocused, disoriented, disorganized and certainly the weakest of the songs.But what the heck. Ray Wylie's able to make anything sound good. I'd even consider buying a recording of ""We Are The World"" if Ray Wylie sang it! (Not that he ever would, of course.)Four stars--coulda been five."
4,"Interesting, but incomplete","I'm not a music specialist, but I enjoyed listening to the historical recordings; even though the sound quality, as expected, isn't very good, the art and sincerity of the singers still comes through. I simply wish that they had included more of the recordings."
2,Sent it back,"I needed something to record info off a radio broadcast, but this little item is way to complicated. Even my very techie son thought the lay out of the buttons was almost impossible to use. Sent it back and got a nice Sansa clip...works perfect for what I needed!"
1,Is this for real?,"I have been in a wheelchair for 10 years due to a multiple injury accident.I would re-name this video ""How to waste 13 minutes and $20""My advice for what its worth:Get a copy of Carl Douglas`s single-Kung fu fighting,have a beer or whatever else you need to loosen up,dance and enjoy yourself!From your UK friendps,i had to give it one star as amazon wouldn`t let me rate it otherwise.(really deserves a minus!)"
4,Point of Entry for a Study of Indonesian History,"This is the standard college text for advanced study of modern Indonesian history. It is an excellent introduction, sufficiently detailed for the appropriate events, such as the 1945-49 revolution, the days of civil war turmoil in the 50s, and the 30 September Movement (""G30S"" for Indonesians) in 1965. It is impeccably researched and annotated, which makes this an excellent resource for further research into Indonesian and Southeast Asian history. The text itself is sometimes slow, but I am always struck by the density of facts, figures, quotations, and citations. An excellent resource."
2,"Delta Industrial 31-300 6"" Belt/12"" Disc Sanding Center","This machine has many good points. It is well constructed, it is sturdy and essentially unmovable. The tables are easy to align with the sanding surfaces. It has loads of power and can remove stock amazingly fast. However, to rate the dust collection system as poor gives it a compliment. It is abyssmal. You need to be outdoors or wear a dust mask when using the disc sander for any heavy sanding. The only place on the disc that collects any dust is when you sand on the outer 1 inch of the disc. Any further in than that and most of the dust come out the other side of the disc. A little detective work showed that there is only a small vacuum inlet (about 1 1/2 by 3 inches). Any dust that escapes this vent is blown back into the shop. The belt sander is only marginally better."
5,"Well Built, Durable, Highly Functional","I bought one of these sanders in 2004 or 2005 through a dealer in Syracuse, New York when they first came out and have found over the years that this machine is better than I expected. It has been trouble free the day I bought it. It is well constructed, accurate and the fit and finish is very good. Adjustments are easily accessable. Its greatest asset is the large tables. They are easy to adjust and their size makes them easier to design and attach jigs and fixtures to. The machine is very heavy and stable in operation, no vibration. I have had no problems with belt tracking or tension. I find a slight disadvantage in the verticle height of the belt platen, but you can't have everything. The dust pickup is not very good at the disc side of the machine, but I have never seen one that was since the old Powermatic sanders from the 1980's. If I were to buy belt/disc sander today, it would probably be this make and model."
2,Good but not American Delta,It's still heavy duty and it works fine but everything seems a little cheaper than the real thing American Delta version. The motor kept tripping breakers when we first turned it on every day but after a few months somehow it settled down and doesn't do that much anymore. Delta said they would replace the motor to fix this but have been out of stock for almost 9 months so I suspect they are not going to honor their warranty. The Chinese Delta service just isn't anything close to what American Delta was before they sold the company to its current ownership. It's a pity.
4,Delta 31-300 Belt/Disc Sander,"A solid, well built machine that should last the home user a lifetime. Sander is as described with plenty of power and my only cause for dissatisfaction is that the size and mounting of the belt table greatly limits the working area of the belt. Easy to setup with good instructions but will require two people. I had delivery and scheduling problems with the freight company and Amazon was of no use resolving them."
3,Delta belt/disc sander,This is a well built machine at a very good price. Instruction manual is lacking in troubleshooting info and web site offers only repair locations. Machine went together easily but belt sander would not turn when pressure was applied. Set screws on drum were not tight and no instructions on how to tighten. Finally found screw location and with some effort was able to tighten. Both disc and belt tracked well with little vibration. Although listed as a dual voltage motor a new switch and cord cap with rewiring is necessary. Belt sandier table shortens usable length by several inches. Overall a quality machine but needs better manual.
1,Not Worth The Price,"My son is a bonified Yankee fan for years. I ordered this book for him. Upon receiving it, I found it only to be a PICTURE BOOK, with hardly any writing involved. To make matters worse, it was expensive, especially for what I bought! I'm not even going to give it to him--I'm too ashamed! If I saw this in a book store and had the opportunity to look through it, I would have never bought--and I'm sure that he would not have either!"
4,DeWalts (Emglows) new compressor,"Looks sharp, provides plenty of air with two outlets, runs quiet. Only negative would be this is fairly heavy (compared to pancakes). I would not recommed for a finish carptenter who may need to carry it from room to room or upstairs on a daily basis."
1,A waste of time and a piece of Junk,"The only thing good about this compressor was the quick shipping, especailly when I shipped it back the next day.. This compressor looked like it fell off the UPS truck several times.. When I recieved it I did not really have to open the box because it was already open.. I filled it with oil, Turned it on and nothing happened.. On top of that the plastic case that goes around the moter was cracked in several places.. I would not recomend getting this kind of item through amazon.com.. Go to the store and spend the extra thirty bucks... thanks for reading this, have a great day.."
2,"great effects, had trouble with reliability","First off, all the effecta and the user interface are some of the best I've dealt with, my only problem was that the effects would switch on and off without my touching the pedal. It's quite possible that the unit I purchased was a fluke, but for now I'm just sticking with my old Digitech"
2,Big Book &#65533; Not Much Content,I found that only a very small part of the book is about Neurofeedback. All the rest is about issues surrounding ADD. The author writes as if he is explaining the material to a 5-year-old child. I found that this book did not increase my knowledge (gathered on the net) of Neurofeedback
4,A Great Introduction,"This book is an excellent introduction to the use of neurofeedback as an alternative to drug therapy in the treatment of ADD/ADHD. It's written for the parent who is researching alternatives for their child, or for the curious and open-minded professional. It's not a ""how to"" manual, and so it doesn't tell a professional how to conduct a neurofeedback session. It doesn't go into details about equipment and so forth. It does give an overview about how brain function affects behavior, and how different brainwave frequencies correspond to states of being. It's very readable, and as a book it's nicely laid out. This book seems to be out of print now, but copies are available, used and new/overstock/remaindered, through Amazon and eBay, in good shape and for very reasonable prices. If you are thinking of trying neurofeedback for ADD/ADHD, or are thinking of getting training in this area, this is a decent place to start."
4,Magnets? really?,"GREAT laser plumb... very accurate, sturdy and functional case.... but theres magnets on it that cant support its own weight lol. I've used the bosch laser plumbs and the magnets come in handy on a fairly regular basis... this one has magnets but they dont even come close to being able to hold the weight of the plumb bob its self. WTF dewalt... really?"
2,"It works, but the stanley one works better","I originally owned the Stanley fat max version laser plumb, but i dropped it from 10' up onto cement. It worked for a while after that but ended up failing. So i looked on amazon and this one was on sale so i thought its a dewalt so it must be better.Well i was wrong, it works fine, and the case is a nice plus. But it takes probably 4 times longer to level out then the Stanley fat max. I need to use it in multiple locations, i place it down mark, move it mark again etc... I have to sit there what seems like forever waiting for it to level out so i can mark my location. So i waste tons of time, which equals money.The Stanly had some sort of a magnetic assist to make it quickly level out. In fact it was almost instant. Plus it is cheaper.needless to say i think i will be returning this for the cheaper stanley fat max laser plumbStanley 77-189 FatMax PB2 Self-Leveling Laser Plumb Bob"
3,Project Folders.,"Not up to my quzality expectation and not all ""Clear"" folders as ordered/expected but that's ok. 2-3 were damaged un usable."
3,Not the best book on the subject,"In my opinion, the Plaster sniper series books are much more comprehensive and informative. As one reviewer here as noted, typo errors are rampant through the book, never a good sign. Lau has some information that Plaster does not and vice versa. Apparently, they are friends as Plaster appears in many photos in this book. Much of the information is old, and many of the sketches are hand drawn in a poor style. That being said, this book is half the price of the Plaster book and is available from Amazon directly. Having compared both at the same time, I would pay the extra money for Plaster's latest sniper book even at twice the price. Either one will serve the purpose, but if you want to see the latest and best techniques and equipment from the current wars ( with old war stories that may get tiring), get Plaster's book."
1,"not the item, but amazon","item rec'd with product packaging box opened. item removed ,protective film taken off then replaced with all other item shived back in the box. looked to me like someone returned this and amazon did not inspect, but just shipped it back out."
1,"Don't Buy this version, wait for the next ONE.","I took the blue ant out of the package and gently pushed the Mic which serves as the ON/OFF switch. It poped out and turned on. I then gently pushed it back in until it clicked, but it WOULD NOT stay in no matter how hard I tried to make it. This made it effectively useless as it could not be turned off. I put it back in the package and returned it."
3,Could be better,"This is my fourth handsfree device. I drive the freeways everyday and I have tested several of these devices. This one is better than most but it is not quite there yet. Reception is not always clear and hard to understand. Im told the other end of the conversation is OK but it could be louder. I find this no better than an earlier model I bought from this company. For city traffic at normal speeds it's OK, not great but it works."
5,Works Well,Just a short note to say this product works as advertised. Occasional glitch which is usually resolved by turning off and on phone - otherwise no problems whatsoever. I use it with VoiceCommand and like the fact that I can voice dial all my contacts. Highly recommended.
5,Fantastic product,I bought this for my husband who does not like using a earpiece bluetooth. He loves the BlueAnt Supertooth and when I am talking with him I can not tell that he is using it. The sound quality is great and almost no background noise.
4,"great product, great customer service","Works as well as advertised. Had a slight problem with mini-boom mic, which also cleverly acts as on/off switch, not staying closed. But customer service has been great -- returned item no questions asked for new unit."
3,Quality? Lacking,"The BlueAnt Supertooth Speakerphone does work as advertised. My only problem: I have purchased 4 of these for my family and I've had to return two for replacement due to the little boom that serves as an on/off switch not working. In the first case it would not close and, therefore would not turn off in the second case it would not open. This occurred after relatively short use and could almost be considered DOA. I love the concept and since this is about the only hands free option available short of putting on a headset and looking like the ""Borg"", I will continue to use it. Amazon has been great about sending a replacement and paying for the shipping on the returns. Just a little hitch in what I hope will be a long lasting product."
4,simple solution,"I decided I didn't want to look like a member of the away team from ""Star Trek"" so I choose an easy solution to Bluetooth for my vehicle. This unit is both practical and less costly than re-wiring my radio and speaker system. I don't use my phone much while driving but when I do this is very convenient."
2,Not a great product...,"This item seemed like a great idea since I don't like bluetooth earpieces and the reviews were very good. For me, however, it did not work well at all. I could hear the person on the other end of the line but they could never hear me clearly. Lots of crackling and fading in and out. I will try to call BlueAnt and see if they can help me. If not, this will be just one more bluetooth device in the trash..."
1,Two for Two,I purchased two of these and within one year both are broken. On one the microphone will not latch in the retracted position -- the other has no transmit audio. Avoid!
4,Great Product,SO far I really like the bluetooth device. It easily connects to my phone every time I turn it on. The only thing I dont like about it is the lil mic that pops out but that does serve a purpose in case you decide to use your sun visor. The speakers on the device are crazy loud and you wont have any trouble hearing the person on the line. I gave it a 4 cause I would like the device to be smaller but it works great like its supposed to.
1,Inferior Spring / Lock Design,"Initially I was very pleased with this device: (a) Simplicity of physical installation (b) ease of configuration and use with our three phones and (c) sound quality on both ends of each called we tested. However, the device will be sent back because after less than 10 extend/retract sequences of the spring-loaded pop-out mic, it stopped locking upon retracting. As a result of the mic being stuck in the extended position, the unit is always powered on."
3,Worn out?,"I purchased this device in Octoer 2008 and was very pleased with it up until May 2010. The spring that contols the microphone popping in and out no longer works. I supposed I could have worn it out since I used this device everyday, but only once a day. Now I'm back to looking for an alternative hands-free device for the Blackberry."
1,Does not pair well with Boulder phones,"I bought eight of these units for our company. All eight have the same problem - people on the other end of the line hear themselves echo. This doesn't happen on every call - probably about 75 percent of the time. I have contacted BluAnt several times about the problem, but they have not been much help. They said that we could send the units back and they would send us new ones. What are the chances of all 8 devices being defective? They finally admitted that they have had many reports of these devices not pairing well with Boulder phones. Even the two blackberries that are used with them get the echo. Not quite as frequent as the boulder phones. I would not recommend this product to anybody. BluAnt customer service is not help either!"
5,Loud and clear. Runs forever on one charge.,"I am very happy with this product. The sound quality is ok and it is very loud and clear specially if you are driving in noisy conditions (traffic, windows down, etc.) Connects to my cell phone every time I turn it on. Like the magnetic holder, makes it very easy to remove in case you wanted to charge or take it out the car. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and recommend this to anyone who might be interested in hands free communication while driving."
4,Blue tooth works well,"Bought a Supertooth, worked well, but lots of echo. Saw upgraded Supertooth Light, has very little echo, but microphone is spring-loaded. First unit was unreliable pushing mike in, so returned. Got replacement very quickly and no problems at all since. Also bought one for my daughter. It's the only way to go while driving- especially with a stick shift. Very reasonable priced if you shop diligently online."
4,Good product,"This is a good option for cars that don't have bluetooth built in. It works well, and the sound quality (talking and receiving) are really good. Big improvement in safety"
4,Works Well!,Does what it is supposed to do. Wife loves it. Would be my second choice to a bluetooth stereo setup.
5,Blue Ant speaker phone,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6R4MK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis is a great product. It was recommended by a radio computer guru ad it works just great. Easy, good sound, etc. I would definitely recommend this myself!"
4,terrific little machine,"I love my Blue Ant! I can talk freely with it, my family can hear me and I can hear them (great noise cancellation) and it is easy to set up and use. I recommend it highly."
4,"I COULD NOT GIVE IT FIVE STARS- SEE BELOW,","I LIKE THE PRODUCT VERY MUCH. THE ONLY PROVLEM I HAVE WITH IT IS AS FOLLOWS: AFTER HAVING FOR LESS THAN A WEEK, WHEN I PUSHED THE MICROPHONE IN TO SHUT IT OFF, IT WOULD NOT REMAIN IN THAT POSITION. I HAVE TO USE RUBBER BANDS ON THE PRODUCT TO KEEP IT TURNED OFF.I DID SEND THIS MESSAGE TO AMAZON,.COM BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REPLY. OTHERWISE, AS MENTIONED ABOVE, I REALLY LIKE THE USEFULLNESS OF THIS PRODUCT."
5,Great Bluetooth Speakerphone,"I have the Gen2 BlueAnt speakerphone for my truck, and it works great. With the changing laws concerning hands-free cellphone use, I needed one for my wife and daughter's cars. These Gen 3 units set up flawlessly, instructions are excellent, and audio quality is superb. In fact, I like it somewhat better than the one I have currently. Battery life is also great! There are a lot of units out there, and I've tried quite a few, but for the quality and ease of use, not to mention the $$$, BlueAnt units are a bargain."
2,Retractable microphone broke after a month,"I originally gave this product a 4 out of 5 star review (4 because I didn't like how the very tight clip putting indentations in my visor). However after only about a month of use, the spring mechanism for the retractable mic got stuck in the deployed 'on' position and did not allow me to push the mic back into the unit to turn it off. Very disappointed as I liked the design and sound quality of this product. Fortunately as always, Amazon was very good in accepting my return for this defect. I have since replaced it with the sleek new Jabra SP5050 speakerphone which in my opinion is a much better product than the BlueAnt from a design standpoint.Jabra SP5050 Bt Speakerphone"
2,A good gadget with some fundamental flaws,"I have owned one of these for several months. It has some nice characteristics. I found the noise cancelling to be good; most people could not tell I was using a speakerphone, even at highway speeds in my ten-year-old Honda Accord. The battery could go a long time between charges.The worst aspect of this device was the boom microphone. To turn on the speaker, you press on the microphone to extend it. This is impossible to do with one hand (you usually dislodge the speaker from the bracket and end up digging it out from under the seat). And the microphone on my unit just broke -- I can't retract the boom and turn the unit off anymore. That's a real problem for a Bluetooth device. It's now basically worthless to me."
4,Very good,I am very impressed with this speakerphone. It was no problem pairing with my phone and making it work. I bought one for both me and my wife and we both love them.
5,Great product,This is best I've seen in a long time. Good reception and the voices are clear. No problem with the setup.Overall rating (10+).George
3,Get the better one,"This speaker phone DOES work pretty well. I really don't like the microphone sliding in and out to turn it on. So, I bought the Supertooth 3 that only costs maybe $20 more and it it WAY better. Just pair it and go. Pairing was easy, and I like it announcing the callers name. Highly recommend the Supertooth 3."
2,pass on it...,i purchased the bluetooth handsfree supertooth light on the recommendation of my niece. she loved it and i needed a way to talk while driving. i've had it for a couple months now and i haven't been able to use it once. i am older and i had trouble figuring out the instructions.. my nephew had to tell me what to do to set it up but even then it didn't work right for me. it doesn't seem to hold a charge and the car charger broke the first time i used it.. half of it stayed in the device when i tried to disconnect. i haven't been able to talk on it yet. so from my experience i'd say pass on it.
2,Returned It,"Ordered this based on the good reviews from others but was totally unsatisfied so returned it within a week. I could hear the person clearly with no problems but the everyone on the other end said they could either hear themselves echo or I sounded like I was standing in in a windstorm/hurricane. I tried turning off the a/c, made sure the windown were up and I even tested it without the car moving and they still said the same thing. The return process was great though. Got my refund within a few days, no questions asked."
4,Nifty Hands-Free,"I had tried other blue tooth devices including a ""visor-mount"" from Costco, all had serious drawbacks. Another Realtor(tm) in my office suggested the Blue Ant. WOW this ""visor-mount-hands-free"" speaker phone is excellent. Callers can hear my voice just as if I was speaking into the phone directly. The only small problem is that the sound of the speaker in the car is inconsistant from call to call. I find myself having to re-adjust the volume as some calls are louder than others. That is a small price for the convinence of this great box. Installation is a snap, and it can be moved from one car to another in a heartbeat. Overall a good device!"
2,BlueAnt,"Easy to set up, no noise when using. However, my microphone arm broke after a week and virtually no usage. Had to return for new one. No misuse was incurred."
3,BlueAnt Customer Service,"Good product but company customer service is very bad. Online RMA request never responded. Never received RMA number after I called the support center. When I called back, their record do not show I called. It's just horrible."
2,False Advertising,"I haven't tried it in the car yet, just received it today. I am going to give it a week and see if it will do for my needs. However, I am very disappointed already. Like many people today, I carry two phones, one business, one personal, so I specifically needed a unit that could handle multiple phones, and the information said this unit could handle up to 5.What the information did not say was ONLY ONE AT A TIME.You have to manually switch between phones, the fact that the unit ""remembers"" the different phones speeds the process but it still takes several seconds to manually disconnect one phone and reconnect the other. I fear that by the time I punch through the menus, even with short cuts, I will have defeated the purpose of getting the hands free."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this product based on a CNET recommendation. CNET has been a reliable source for most of my technology purchases. This however, was a disappointment. The unit does not eliminate sound effectively, volume controls are ""mushy,"" the microphone/on off switch will not stay retracted, resulting in a constantly discharging battery. It did pair easily, and the voice activated controls worked well. I would not purchase another, and would advise others to avoid this model."
1,It's kid's toy,It's wasting $ to buy this product. 75% of times it doesn't recognize my voice commands. The other end of phone conversation can hear the loud echo of his or her speaking. It's kid's toy.
2,BlueAnt Supertooth Hands-free Speakerphone,Bluetooth quality insufficient. Ended up getting the Samsung WEP200 ear bud unit and am very pleased with it (see the review for it).
1,Does not work in noisy cars,"This is the nicest-looking speakerphone, but when I tried it in my Honda Civic the result was not good -- people I called could not understand me very well, and the phone went into half-duplex mode for some reason, so only one person could talk at a time. Disappointing!"
3,PROS AND CONS,"The pros about this product is that it has good sound. The cons I found is if you have more than 1 car, you have to remember to take the 'clip' that it attaches to. Another problem I found is when I stop at different places I don't feel comfortable leaving the product on the visor so you have to remember to put it away or take it with you. Once you get used to it its not so bad but just another thing to remember about."
4,Hands Free Blue Ant a Winner,"This was recommended on a podcast that I listen to regularly. It has worked great. Easy to adjust volume, easy off and on. Strong magnet holder that keeps it in place on the visor. Battery life is remarkable. I charge it once a week and sometimes not even that. I use every day as part of a sales and sales management job.I have been using it since beginning of August with ZERO issues, which is exactly the same number of issues the republicans used to win the white house ;-) OK, I take that back."
5,BlueAnt Supertooth Light - Excellent!!,"I have had several Bluetooth speakerphones, and have returned most of them. I had the VBT3000 (from Costco) for about a year, and the biggest problem was the lack of full duplex (difficult to have a conversation if each party doesn't wait to speak). Although sound quality wasn't as good as this BlueAnt Supertooth Light (BSLT). I have now been using the BSLT for about 3 weeks and I travel quite a bit (I'm in sales). The quality of sound on both sides is excellent, the full duplex makes this a joy to use, and the battery life has also been excellent. Also, I had read reports about problems with the magnetic mount, but I've had no troubles - and I think this is an excellent feature if you want to bring it in the house for charging. I highly recommend this product!!!"
5,Very satisfied,This is a great product to have. It has very easy controls to use and easily accessed. Sound clarity is good and I feel it is better than using an ear piece. I am considering on buying others for my teenage daughters that can't seem to go anywhere without talking on the cell phone.
4,Works as advertised,"Simple to pair with my phone, very easy to operate, and battery life seems to be good. Sometimes wish speaker volume was a little louder, but overall works very well."
2,Constant Problem With Microphone,"As others have said, I have had constant problems with the microphone not holding when pushed back in. The first time it would not click back into place, by around the 30th time it went in. The second time, it took about 10 attempts. This third and last time, I have not been able to get it back in and I have tried for two months. I now just leave it out, but have to keep it constantly charged in my car. Really annoying!Also the viser clip is too small for my car."
2,can't turn it off,"I was very happy with this product for about a month. Much more satisfactory than the Motorola bluetooth ear piece I previously had. To turn it off, you have to depress the microphone arm. It just keeps springing back out and therefore turns back on. This means I cannot transfer a call to my cell phone when I arrive at my destination. The battery won't stay charged as long either. I have jury-rigged it for the moment by jamming a stick in with the microphone arm, but this is ridiculous. I will be returning it to Amazon shortly."
5,wireless cell phone receiver,"The Blue Ant wirless receiver is by far the best unit out there in wireless communication, easly mounts on car visor and the reception is crystal clear, stanby time is great lasts long time before needing charge.as the ear piece type beat amile , yes costs more but you will love it if you do lots of hands free cell phone talking in your car. Amazon has best price around also with quick delivery."
4,Great product,"I really needed a product like this that included car charger and mount in my car big enough that it will be hard to loose since I already lost 3 ear pieces.What i would like to see in the future is caller ID, be able to synchronize more that one phone at the same time."
4,It's perfect for what we needed!,"The BlueAnt is perfect for what we needed. I can't stand having a hands free earpiece hanging on my ear, but when California instituted its new handsfree law, I had to find something. This works absolutely great!BlueAnt Supertooth Light Bluetooth Handsfree Speakerphone, Black"
3,blue ant defective,"The unit microphone button would not stay in when recieved (could not turn unit off), had to send the unit back to be replaced. It took a week to get a new unit back, in the meantime I was breaking the law (California drivers cannot drive/ talk). Sound quality is fair, battery life is great."
2,Bluetooth problem,"The sound and transmitting is great in this unit, but the on-off mic switch which you push in to turn the the unit on and off has a weak clasp that breaks.The mic no longer stays in the off position. I have bought two of these units and they both developed this problem. I have come up with a rubber band to hold the mic in, very inconveniant."
3,It's probably going to be great but...,"It looks like the Supertooth will be a great product but mine had problems with the buttons - sometimes they worked and sometimes they didn't.Sent it back to BlueAnt a couple of weeks ago and haven't seen a replacement yet!Poor form,Will"
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"BlueAnt BA-SUPERTOOTH3 Bluetooth Handsfree (Black)Connection with mobile phone almost instantaneous, speaker works well. Doesn't function well in my convertible with the top down (of course, I didn't expect it to!). Would like a more audible tone when bluetooth connection is made. Magnets & the metel visor clip seem to hold it in place just fine."
4,Blue Ant bluetooth speaker better than most,"I bought this model, Supertooth Light, when the original Blue Ant Supertooth 2 was no longer available. I also have the original. The original has better sound and a useful analog volume control. This is next best thing and a big improvement over my Motorola blue tooth speaker"
4,Super Blue tooth,"I purchased an older Blue Ant product which did not work with my Iphone. I am not sure if the compatability is the newer model or the 2.0 software in the Iphone but they work beautifully together.I like the simplicity of the funtions since I use it exclusively in the car. The only thing its missing is a caller ID function, which i'm not sure I would be able to use while driving anyway."
1,Malfunction at arrival,Never had able to use it in the car. Microphone eject feature failed to work properly.
2,Mic boom eventually breaks,"I have owned supertooth light for about 2 years and finally the boom would not stay in the ""off"" or retracted position. When pushed in the boom would not engage inside the unit. The tranmsit and reception quality is good however but now I fear the battery life will be severly shortened due to always being in the boom out or ""on"" position."
2,Good for driving in a quiet car.,"First the device was bigger than I thought. I drive on the highway to commute to work, and I can hear the road. I had a hard time hearing the other people on the other line, so I have to turn the volume all the way up. But when I turn the volume all the way up, the other person on the other line could hear themselves. They would say they can hear an echo. Also the other person on the other line says I sound far away. In a quieter car, or driving in town it is fine. I bought a Motorola T305 and it is much smaller (fits in the palm of my hand), and sound quality is much better. I can hear better over the noise of the road. No echo, even with the volume all the way up."
4,Great Product,Great reception with clarity! Better then an ear piece! Trust me I have been through several earpieces!
2,Doesn't Dial Out Well,"This was originally a good idea - connects easily. However, it NEVER understands any dial commands so I'm unable to dial out without using my cell phone. Plus the folks at the other end were not able to hear me very well - doesn't appear to be omitting background noise as advertised. Very disappointed and will be returning. Am going to use my Garmin GPS for my hands free..."
2,Terrible audio,"Pros: Charger is the same as my blackberry. It comes with AC and car charger, it's sleek design, easy to operateCons: Too quietI need something I can use in my car and this just doesn't cut it. Too soft and other people can't hear me."
4,VEry good product!,"I have used this for the past month now, and it works very good! Only thing I wish was better, is the speaker level, I wish that the speaker was louder. I have the habit of always driving with the sunroof wide open, and I am heard well by poeple that call me... But I have a hard time hearing them. As long as I keep the sunroof closed the product works great! Thanks!"
4,Handsfree and safe,"I bought this Blue Ant so that I could comply with the new California law that it is illegal to use your cell phone while driving, unless you are using a handsfree device. In addition, I bought a cell phone holder that clips to my air vent, so my phone (Motorola RAZR) is clipped on and open while I drive. This way, I can see on my screen who is calling if I do receive a call. The sound quality is decent, and it is so much more convenient and more comfortable than wearing the bluetooth headset. I like it."
4,just o.k,I`ve been using this Blueant for the last month and the real drawbacks are background noise to the receiver of the call and the magnets if your not careful it will pop off and you can drop the speakerphone so you would need to velcro it for extra support. I think if it had noise canceling it would make this much more easier to be heard..from the receiver end. Good battery life..like all bluetooth products the voice recognition is very irritating..you will be screaming at it.
4,Blue Ant is ok,"this product works ok....sound quality is ok, but somewhat harsh..difficult to recognize voices of friends...connects to phone quickly. Would recommend."
5,Easy to install and even easier to use.,"BlueAnt Supertooth Light Bluetooth Handsfree Speakerphone, BlackThis hands free works great. I bought 6 for gifts. They are easy to install and even easier to use."
4,BlueAnt Bluetooth Handsfree Speakerphone,"Easy to setup and use. Clear voice clarity. Good voice pickup. Battery life is super long. I've had probably a 1/2 dozen earpieces over the years because the speaker phone of built in cells generally isn't that great, but the earpieces get bothersome after awhile. This unit is great. If you drive an hour per day, one charge will take you through the month (just remember to push the mic back into the unit - that's how you turn it off). No more tired shoulders or arms from speaking on your cell during the long calls."
3,Supertooth,The reception is good in the car. However people on the other end say there is a lot of background noice when at highway speed.
2,Poor,"I used only at home (not in a car). I was told that the sound quality heard on the other end was horrible, despite being in a silent room and speaking within inches of the mic. Also, no mute button (useful for conference calls). Overall, disappointed."
3,issues,I enjoyed the product for a while untill the mouth piece spring seemed to break and i could not put it back in. It keeps popping out. I have to tape it shut in order to use it in the car.
4,Great addition to iphone,"Unit performs as expected..great. Co-worker has one and after him showing me how it worked, had to have one."
4,Works well,"This speakerphone works reasonable well. The sound quality is good, both on the sender and receiver's end. You can still tell that you're on a speakerphone, but I expected that when I got it. The volume level seems to be good. I have a Toyota Corolla and I can turn the volume up loud enough on the highway to still hear the caller. I would recommend this product to anyone who wanted a reliable hands-free product for their car."
5,Pleasant Experience,"I have tried several of the blue tooth ear pieces. They are annoying, disruptive, feel funny, sort of ugly, but work. Then, I tried a Parrot, it was troublesome in that it needed to be paired every time I left the car and came back to it. When I got the Blue Ant, it was like full automatic. Nothing to do. Charge it, put it on my visor, pull the mike out (which is the On switch), and it sounded so good, was easy to use, and every time I ran errands, it was connected when I returned to the car each time. What a pleasure. This is the finest small electronic appliance or device available for the average person who does not want to tinker. I love it. Thank you, Blue Ant, and Amazon."
2,BlueAnt speakerphoone,"has a problem with connect. You can always tell the quality of the call will be negitive when the connect signal is in high and low volume dispersements, which is most of the time.(moto razer)A lot of echo most of the time which I believe is associated with connect.(ATT)Buttons for connect disconnect can be as bad as trying to use your phone in the car, hard to press and confirm its use(out of sight). The microphone is directional and should have been make with a omnidirection mike.(mic faces away from you any setup)Battery needs to be larger (3 day max use)this would increase connect power along with a stronger reception between you phone. Try another brand and good luck!"
2,Defective Design,"As many other reviewers have mentioned, the extending boom microphone design is simply defective. Mine broke a few weeks after I bought the unit. The boom will not stay pushed, and hence the unit will not turn off."
2,Broken Mic on the 5th day...,"So, I did my research and read the reviews and purchased the unit around 5 days ago. I loved it, the audio was clear, it was nice and loud, and sync'd up to my phone in a matter of seconds.5 days into having the device I went to turn it off by pushing in the boom microphone and noticed that the spring was no longer locking the mic in. The unit cannot be turned off. I've seen a few reviews like this but thought I'd give it a shot, but I should have listened.I'm packing the unit up as we speak to return. Be cautious about this product."
2,Could have been Better!,"Amazon was great in their shipping (and when I returned the item)! But the BlueAnt Supertooth Light was not what it was cracked up to be. It was not as loud as everyone said and I thought it was...well...kinda cheap in its construction. Glad I was able to return it and not have an expensive brick on my hands. Pick up by the mic was not like others stated. You could not talk at normal level and always be heard. It worked, but not as well as I was lead to believe."
3,My sister was disappointed,"I purchased this product for my sister for her birthday because she travels a lot and needs to be handsfree. Unfortunately, the product didn't work as she needed it to. She couldn't hear anyone she called when she was driving on the highway. They could hear her, but she couldn't hear them. This could be attributed to the manufacturing of her car and too much interior noise due to leaking air through windows or doors, but still there should be some way to turn the device up to account for that. She was disappointed."
4,BlueAnt Bluetooth Handsfree Speakerphone,"Due to state laws in NJ, you can be pulled over for not using a hands free device as a primary offense. I found various hands free devices to be uncomfortable and sound quality fair. BlueAnt solved all the above. Very easy to set up and synch to my Motorola Razr. I have had the device for exactly one month and I am still running on the first charge. Sound quality for callers and receivers is almost as good as handheld if the windows are up. Device remembers volume level and last call dialed. Amazon has the best price when factoring in free shipping."
1,too much echo,Would not recommend. Far too much echo for the person on the other end of the line. Cannot carry on a conversation.
4,Blue Ant Bluetooth,"Great product...easy to use, connects every time. Speaker has clear and good sound, set up my N95 in a matter of minutes. Long lasting battery charge and great price!"
4,BlueAnt Supertooth Light handsfree,"This product was easy to set up. Many options for placement in car. The speaker could use more volume, but I would still recommend it."
5,great for traveling,MY HUSBAND TRAVELS FOR WORK AND WE BOUGHT A HEADSET AND RETURNED IT FOR THIS HANDS FREE SPEAKER. MY HUSBAND CANT FIND A EAR ONE TO FIT RIGHT HE LOVES THIS AND SO DO WE TO TALK TO HIM. WE GET IN THE CAR AND PUSH IN MIC TO TURN ON AND OUR PHONE FINDS IT AUTOMATICALLY.NO ROAD NOISE SOUNDS JUST LIKE HE IS ON CELL PHONE. SO NOW I AM BUYING ONE FOR MY CAR.WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,People Couldn't Hear Me,"I bought this for my wife. She tried it for a couple of weeks but switched to a blue tooth headset. I then tried it for a few weeks. It was too large to fit on the driver's side visor and permit me to flip the visor all the way down to block the sun. I then moved it to the passenger's side visor where it was excellent for listening to calls but the people with whom I was speaking said they could not hear me. Also, the noise of the air conditioner (even on low) made it so the person with whom I was speaking could not hear me at all. I then started holding it in my hand when I was using it -- which completely defeats the unit's hands-free purpose. Finally, I gave up. It is now sitting in a rummage box heading for Goodwill."
5,"So far, so good","I just got this a couple weeks ago after my Contour Surface Sound died. So far I absolutely love it, the sound is EXCELLENT on both ends, the volume is GREAT! It just works and works well. The only complaint is minor, but it would be great that when you receive a call, you turn it on and it would automatically connect to the call, but it doesn't, otherwise I love it!"
5,Love our Blueant,"Great gadget, easy setup, easy to use & great sound.No problems w/other people hearing us or visa versa.The magnet is nice & strong, no problems there either."
4,BlueAnt Speakerphone VS VR3 Speakerphone,"I've used both. The VR3 is ok, passible, usable. The BlueAnt is better and easier at bluetooth comm with your cellphone in the car (and both are soooo much easier that an earpiece!). BA clips to the visor, but holds to the clip with two strong magnets instead of a solid attachment. This is much handier, to take with you or in recharging the unit. You turn it on by pushing in on the retracted antenna-looking thingie (actually the mic) that pops out. Easier than finding a little button and holding it down. Sticking out, it tells you its on, an easier reminder to turn it off when you're done with it than the VR3. I'm told that both units sound clear to the person you're talking to. However, the BA is louder, clearer and easier for me to hear that person than when using the VR3, especially in my NOISY Honda CR-V (another story). Easy, bigger buttons and volume control, and stays on when plugging in the recharger. Does all I need it to do."
4,Good choice if you don't want a headset,"I'm on my second Supertooth Light because the catch on the extending mic (on/off switch) broke. I have come to find out from other reviews that this problem is too common. Having said that, I love the way it works - enough to ask for a replacement rather than a refund - but am holding my breath that this one will be more durable. I had a Motorola visor-clip bluetooth speakerphone prior to the BlueAnt. While it did not have any moving parts that can break, the sound quality using the BlueAnt is far superior on both ends. I feel I made a smart, informed choice with the BlueAnt, and that I got a good deal at the Amazon price of $69."
4,Great Product,"This product is great! Outstanding audio quality, battery life for talk time are the best I have seen. It is great to be able to pair the device to more then one phone. I put one in each of our cars. It's great to just jump in turn the unit on and it pairs to whatever phone you have in the car."
4,BlueAnt Supertooth,"For those who do not want to hassle with a ear bluetooth while driving, the BlueAnt Supertooth is just the product to have. It installs easily; it gets clipped to your visor and connects, when on, to get incoming calls. I did have to return the first one I ordered because the on/off mechanism broke and I'm hoping the replacement will not have the same problem."
2,"Good sound, bad design","The speaker is remarkably good on this unit, providing clear full sound. The microphone is adequate, requiring you to speak strongly (like you were in a play) to be heard well, but generally performs well. The part that I didn't like was the part that retains the microphone when you turn it off. It acts a bit like a ball point pen, you push the microphone in and it stays, turning the unit off. You push on it again and it pops out, turning the unit on. The problem is that when my car get hot, something inside warps and causes the unit to stick and not release the microphone to turn it on. If you tap it hard, the microphone will pop out, but then the mechanism will not hold when you try to push the microphone back in again to turn it off. I was able to successfully open the unit and remount the retainer mechanism back into place and it would work until it got hot again. Again, this is a good unit providing your car doesn't get too hot inside."
5,BlueAnt Supertooth Handsfree Speakerphone,I've had this speakerphone for about a month now and it is a keeper. I've returned others because people could not hear me because of an echo/or noise. I haven't received any complaints with the BlueAnt.
5,Works great,"I have had this for a week now and so far it has worked like a charm.Very easy to pair it with my cell phone and I have also paired it with other cell phones with no problem.It picks up my voice very well to place a call or action, rarely do I have to retry the call but it will happen time to time.People on the other side of the call hear me clearly and with out any speaker sounding effect.And I hear them very clearly.It also came with a cell phone holder that you can place on one your air vents in front of you.This is very handy when you place or receive a call you can see who's calling or it displays what you are doing. Amazon has one of the lowest prices for this Blue tooth devise and with free shipping !"
2,Noise cancellation?,"I had a few peers recommend the Supertooth Light to me. They boasted about the volume and noise cancellation. I am happy about the volume but folks on the other end of the line definitely hear noise whenever I use it. It almost seems worthless in a car, which was one of the principle reasons that I purchased it. My other BT headset is a Jawbone so maybe I have unrealistic expectations but for now it will be reserved for quiet areas. Still worthwhile when I'm on the road with colleagues and we need to group around a speakerphone: much better than the phone's built-in speakerphone!"
4,Supertooth Light Works Well,"The Supertooth Light works well with my Sanyo Katana II bluetooth phone. Noise cancellation is good, but sometimes I do have difficulty understanding my wife while she is using it. I don't think it is any worse than any other visor-mounted hands-free device."
5,Blueant review,I bought this unit initially for my wife. The sounds was so clear I got another one for myself. Everyone hears me clearly. Easy set up too. I would highly recommend this for people who are in their car alot and don't use a headset bluetooth.
3,Blue Ant - Microphone off switch problem,"I liked the no installation feature of this unit. Just charge it, synchronize the Blue Tooth function with your cellular phone and you were off and driving down the road with no installation costs or down time.The unit was fully operational for the first 3-weeks. It worked very nicely during hands free usage. However, during the third week the on/off switch, which is built into the slide out microphone, would not stay retracted in the off position. As the microphone was slid in to turn off the device, you could feel the catch click but the microphone would not stay in the retracted off position.I contacted the manufacturer service representative and was provided with swift service re returning the unit. I am awaiting the arrival of the new unit to see if I experience the same problem. If this occurs a second time, I will be looking for a different hands free unit to purchase."
3,Blueant,Hands free bluetooth that can be attached by clip and magnet to your car visor.My mic assemble failed to lock and I had to send it in for repair or replacement. The second one seems to be working okay. BlueAnt customer service is slow but they final sent me an RMA to return the unit. I had to spend more money on shipping it to them and they returned it at their expense. So my saving advantage by buying on-line was reduced.
2,blue ant,"antenna ceased to go in after one week's use. Other wise worked fine, just couldn't turn it off"
4,hands free almost,"i got my blue ant to comply with californias new hands free law it works much better than units worn on your ear i hear callers and they hear me clearly no echo chamber sound, but its buttons to recieve and end a call have to be pressed on the ant for a 1-3 second time,so you still use your hands to call and my car is a standard shift so there are times in traffic shifting and ansewering a call are just as bad as holding a phone and shifting ."
2,shafted by the microphone shaft,Everything about this hands-free device is wonderful except that the spring loaded microphone shaft has a serious design flaw. As I wait to hear from Blue-Ant (another sore spot) I am using a rubberband to keep my less than one month old microphone shaft inside the device. The shaft retracting into the device is the only way to turn it off. Once the flaw is addressed they will have a superior product.
4,BlueAnt Bluetooth Handsfree,I really like and enjoy my new BlueAnt Bluetooth handsfree device. The sound quality is great and so is the volume. It is very easy to use.
2,BlueAnt Bluetooth Speaker,"Microphone Breaks Very Easily after Owning it for Just a Few Weeks! Note Very Well Designed. I Normally don't write Bad Reviews, but this one Deserves it. Save Your Money and Buy Something Else."
3,Good tech,Glue on on/off switch let go kind of quick. But Clean and nice fit. Better than eBay. Better than waiting in line at a brick and mortar store then paying wayyy too much for the same item. Besides the local stores didn't stock then and took too long to order. Just what I needed.
3,"Good Product but volume starts out very low, irritating","This is a good product. Ease of pairing was very simple and quick.However it is very irritating when the call first comes in or you make a call the volume starts out very low no matter how much you adjust the volume settings.That is the only thing wrong with this unit. I don't know why it does this but it always starts out with a very poor and low volume sound. It takes at least thirty seconds or so to reach audible volume. This is very irritating to myself and the people whom I am calling, they cannot hear me hardly at all during the first 30 seconds of any call."
3,disappointed!,"I've had my Blue Ant Light for less than 3 months. I loved the freedom it gave me from having that ""thing in my ear"". However, the microphone started having difficulty poppoing out (which is how the ant turns on). It now will not come out at all. I called their customer service and learned that mine it not the first one with this problem! There is a spring inside that gets caught. I'm now waiting for an e-mail from them (""should get it within 2-3 days"") so that I can return it for repair. The repair should be done ""within 18 days"" of when they get it back. In other words, I could be without it for almost a month and then who knows how long it will function properly this time? I'd go with the regular Blue Ant. My husband has had his for quite a while-no microphone to pop out-it works perfectly. Go with the regular one!"
4,"Great, but be careful of mic.","This is my second Supertooth Light after the sliding mic simply failed to lock when pushed back in - which also turns it on or off. It works wonderfully & after the first mic break, I sent it back because it was under warranty. Blue Ant sent a replacement quickly. After the second one did the same and no longer warrantied, I chose to fix it myself. And it turns out the piece that locks the mic is a piece of plastic held by inferior glue, I used super glue and the thing works great. My conversations on the other end tell me I sound okay, an occasional ""you sound like you're in a bathroom"" and a couple say there's a minor echo (echo...echo). Really depends on the call and environment. Overall, a good value if they'd just fix the inevitable break of the mic. I also think the cold weather, then hot weather changes affect the glue - but that's me putting on my Glue Hat on... :^)"
2,"Worked great, until it broke","This product worked just great for a few months, then the phone part that you have to push back in to turn it off, would not latch back in. So, I couldn't turn it off. It is a good product, but they should not have made it so that you have to push in something to turn it on or off...that is always something that breaks! If they had this with a normal on/off switch, I would buy it again in a heartbeat, but as is, no thanks."
2,Defective Produce and Extra Cost to Fix,"I've used another Supertooth Light for a couple of years and liked it, which is why I bought this one.However, I was sent a defective product (the microphone didn't work)... and had to pay to ship it back to get it replaced by BlueAnt!!Based on this experience I will never buy another piece of electronics gear from Amazon."
2,Another Blue Tooth accessory for my dustpile,"This works great when my car is stopped and the engine is shut off and the windows are rolled up. Even the most diehard people I talk to who are great ""bluetooth interpreters"" when quality gets sketchy say it sounds like crap. Again, if I'm stopped it's fine, but the microphone is VERY directional, in the end I was just holding it in my hand like a phone and asked myself why? Why am I even using it? Putting my Razor on speaker and sticking it up on the visor works better than this thing. One thing, I drive an Nissan Altima, and the highway noise in the cabin is fairly high. You might do better in a quieter car, but I'll take mine out of my desk and give it to you."
2,Not all that great,"Although it was easy to set up, convenient to use and works fine with my phone, I think I will return it. If there is not a lot of outside noise, I can usually hear the person on the other end okay, but it is extremely hard for them to hear me. I have tried to speak up, but I shouldn't have to yell when I'm on the phone."
1,Seems like a GREAT product BUT.......,"From the description and the HIGH reviews, it seemed like a great product. However in this case, the LOW reviews seem to be the most correct.My problem with the unit was the person who I was talking to ALWAYS heard an echo. Even after repeated attempts to try and wait out a conversation for 15 minutes or more to see if voice cancellation would kick in, was unsuccessful.I did contact support and a few days after not hearing from them I went ahead and packed up the device and dropped it in the mail the day support wrote me back.Support said my phone was the problem and not the device. They also said they had numerous reports about my samsung phone not being supported. However, my motorla blue tooth phone did not work and better with the device. They also said it may have been due to excessive road noise from my vehicle.I drive a 2002 Lincoln LS and a 2005 Ford F-150 XLT. Both VERY Quiet vehicles.The echo even happened when sitting in the driveway with the car off."
2,missing parts,"No user manual in the package, which appeared to have been previously opened. Amazon said they'd ship another unit out, but I'd have to wait 7 days. I paid to get the original thing shipped quickly, but Amazon didn't seem to care. Amazon said it's due to the July fourth holiday. I said fine, overnight it and I'll get on Monday. They said no. I've had decent luck with Amazon in the past, but apparently customer service is no longer a priority. Sorry to say this will be my last transaction with Amazon."
3,Price just doubled!!!,I got this a few months ago at $39. Now it is over $60?!?!?!? I want to buy another for my wife but what is up with doubling the price?????
4,Amazing for the tiny price tag,"Yeah, it's a cheap little souveneir uke. But it has wood top, sides, back and neck, tuners that work, proper fret placement and decent action. In other words, you can really play it and it sounds okay (not great; it's a little quiet and doesn't have much of a ring). Anyway, it isn't just a wall hanger. Mine is going to spend a lot of time on my sailboat."
4,"Lacks the ""polish"" of an authentic floor board","Just received my board, and while I am happy with the purchase there are two things I noticed which I feel impact the value of the board. The board does not have a ""heso"" or the pyramidal cavity at the bottom of the board. This should not be an issue because the board is not really thick enough to require one for drying purposes, but could impact the sound quality. Also the manufacturer has chosen to apply a rather opaque finish to the playing surface which significantly mutes the grain of the wood. It is common with Korean and Japanese made goban to allow the natural grain to show on the playing surface.That said, you aren't going to find anything else this pretty in the U.S. at this price unless you snag it on a business trip to Japan ;)"
3,Good clean campy fun!,"I saw this film when it had a theatrical run last year. The entire film is contexualized as a midnight movie feature complete with actor Tom Noonan as a fictional ""host"" who guides you through the whole movie.It is not very scary, but if you are looking for an old school 80's style slumber party gore-fest, you can do a lot worse!The director Ti West obviously has a lot of love for 80's horror and has created an awesome love letter/worthy addition to the genre.Recommended."
5,HELLFARM...,"THE ROOST is the perfect movie to add to your next halloween marathon, right along w/ NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, FRIGHTMARE, etc. Director / writer Ti West has fashioned a cool tribute to the all american Saturday night creature feature. Tom Noonan (Manhunter, Monster Squad) is our ghoulish host, introducing us to the fearful feature. Four young folks wreck their car on the way to a wedding. There's only one old farmhouse they can go to for help in the rural area. Too bad for them that the farm is under a horrific vampire bat invasion! These fuzzy flappers are no ordinary mammals, as their bite causes the victim to become a flesh-craving zombie! Things get very interesting. THE ROOST has been mostly (sadly) overlooked and deserves a chance..."
1,Got it for free and it still cost too much,"I'm glad to see the friends and family members of the actors have done their reviews. Now for an unbiased one. This movie was about as much fun as a root canal. The action was slow, the plot made no sense, and most of the ""action"" took place off-screen. The best parts of the film were those blank screen transitions between scenes; at least then I could hope that the movie was over. If you can't get this for free, don't bother watching it. You'll hate yourself in the morning."
5,A Great Movie,When i seen Wil Horneff and his sister Vanessa was in a horror movie together called the roost i was hoping that it would be about Vampire bats and i was right. And it ended the way i never would thought instead of Wil's charcter that Wil played killing his sister his sister ending his life and that's what made it different from any other vampire movie i ever seen. Way to go guys.Rondall
4,Fantastic,"This is a telling story of one girl in a concentration camp. The twist is that the camp was run by Americans, imprisoning Japanese-Americans ""for their own safety"" during World War II. Intriguing for all ages."
5,Good reference book.,"Like the rest of Haynes' manuals, concise and to the point. Well written and good layout as well. As noted above by others, it's divided off into chapters each covers first the history and theory behind the various types of welding, and then a general walk-through of the use. It covers the basics from someone who's walking into welding cold (er, bad pun, sorry) not necessarily a handbook for a welding student. In its defense, this is admitted within its pages. Still i found it to be a useful addition to my shop library. It was interesting reading, as well as a good primer for someone who is looking into starting up a welding rig. If you think you're ready to buy your first welder, i recommend you take a look at this. Well worth the couple of bucks. One last point, as with all technical books, keep an eye out for the newest editions. Advancements are always making tech manuals slightly out of date. Not a real big concern as far as welding, but something to keep an eye on."
3,A good supliment to other books,"There are all sorts of books on the same subject that do not sell for much. Buy all you can aford. It is always good to have several books on hand on the same subject. In other words you may not understand one, but you may understand another.Its like having several teachers you can talk to on the same subject."
3,Good on the basics -- needs to be updated,"This book is a good overview ot the welding processes, however it needs to be updated. The MIG welder section does not feature many of the newer models available from Miller and Lincoln. In the stick welding section the author leaves the impression that DC stick welding machines are out of the price range of most hobby welders. This is really not the case as an AC/DC welder from Lincoln can be purchased for and additional $200 above the Lincoln AC welder. The book has a very good section on brazing however, all things considered it is worth the purchase price."
3,It's OK for what it is,I'm not overly impressed. This book gives only an overview of a lot of different types of welding. Not a lot of details
4,Fabulous Introduction,"A very good introduction to using elisp. I have about a decade of experience programming and extending Emacs; I picked this up to consider giving it to my computer science students. I finally decided against it only because Successful Lisp is such an amazing book. No, really, I cannot recommend Successful Lisp highly enough.This book is very good and focuses on the specifics of Emacs Lisp. If you are interested in extending that venerable editor, this is a good place to start. If you are interested in learning programming in Lisp (specifically Common Lisp), take a look at Successful Lisp."
3,Cute book,"I'll start out by saying, my son loves this book so I guess that makes it a winner. But if you ask me, it isn't much of a book. Just a few pages long and a few flaps to look in and really no story. He does like to lift the flaps and look inside and is really enjoying animals now so I make up my own story and we pick out the animals. If you have a little elmo fan in your house they'll like this book even though you won't think much of it. And in the 4 for 3 deal it doesn't strain your wallet much."
5,my son loves it,"My 2 yrs old son LOVEd it and he took it with him every where and even to the day care when he just got it. Now he knows all the names and sounds of the animals in the book because he kept asking me to read the book to him over and over again for 2 weeks. Now he is not that crazy with the book (thanks god!) but he still enjoys reading it occasionally. Anyway, highly recommend it especially if your kids are the little fans of Elmo."
3,Elmos world animals,"I bought this book for my 18 mo old. He liked it because it had animals in it, and the lift the flaps,but this isnt one of the books that he grabs to read over and over."
4,Bring on the Elmo!,My 20-month old loves all things Elmo- she has this book memorized. Great use of animal sounds and fun flaps to open and close. Get the whole series!
1,The Measure of a Man by Alan Karmin,"After reading this book cover to cover and knowing both the author and his exwife, it saddens me to read all the untruths and part truths in his book. The police,judges,friends,his sister and brother that sided against him on the words of his wife is just ridiculas.They saw actions to make them side the way they did ,not mere words. It also saddens me to see his children dragged thru this once again, this time in words that can't be taken back> they are set in stone. I can see by the tone of hatred in this book and the poor me poor me tone that someone still just isnt over a marriage that ended years ago. The author needs to move on."
3,Solid Drill Press But Initial Woes,I just received and put together my Delta 17-968. It is a solid drill press and went together smooth. I fired it up and let it run for a minute. Then I slowly started to change speeds. After taking the speed down about half way it suddenly jumped back to full speed. To make a long story short I took it apart and found that a roller had come off. It took three hours to disassemble the head and reinstall the part. Not a serious flaw but a major pain. Hopefully this is not a sign of things to come. I may up the rating after I have had a chance to use it and if I experience no additional workmanship issues.
5,Good Solid Drill Press,"Just recieved the Delta 17-968 this week. Assembly was easy and all tools were provided. Took roughly an hour. The drill press is one heavy sucker. Which provides the needed stability to keep it vibration free. I am loving the variable speed control which works flawlessly and quietly except at both ends of the spectrum, 200 RPMs and 2500Rpms. No biggy, just a bit louder. It comes wired for 110 and after hogging out a few 2"" holes in some sugar maple to test it with a forstner bit, I see no reason to up it to 220. This motor did not bog at all. I am very pleased with this tool, more than likely the last drill press I will buy."
5,Cute,"Looks nice, isn't flimsy. Lid rotates on and off easily. Comes with a fairly powerful magnet on the bottom and a metal strip with adhesive, but I haven't tried to stick it somewhere since fits in my cupholder with room to spare. Made in Japan :)"
5,beautiful,"sturdy, not too heavy..and the design is like a water that flows! what a good way to wear jewelry, i would definitely buy more anklets!"
3,"thorough working of 3ds max, but...","While Murdock covers all aspects of 3ds max in great detail, he does very little to explain the actual process of modelling.Although the 3ds max bible is full of tutorials, they almost always start from a given model and end with only a brief modification to it.I would have prefered more tutorials that start from *scratch* and work to decent end-product."
2,Complete but confusing,While this book covers a lot of material it is very confusing. The first chapter shouldn't be attempted until you read the second chapter. The first exercise asks you to create a project without first taking you through the interface. That comes in the second chapter.Not the best book for a beginner. The tutorials that come with 3ds max are better.
3,Step by Step,"This is a pretty good book, but the examples need to show step by step in picture what is taking place. The first snag I ran into was the quick start. It tells you to do an outline and use the lathe modifier. There needed to be a picture of how he set up his spline. All we got was the finished lathed image. Until I loaded the file and removed the lathe modifier, I had no idea how he had drawn th intial spline. Overall it provides good instructions and I am glad to see better quality models than the ones in MAX 6 bible. Who wants to get taught how to use software, if the models look cheesy?"
2,Another example of bad how to books in computing,"This book suffers from the almost universal problem that most computer instructional guides do... lack of any educational theory in its writing. It does not guide the newcomer through the art of learning the software, but rather deals with issues as if one is going through the menu commands. The tutorials consistantly use elements and commands that one will not cover for another hundred por more pages, and the chapters are not designed to ""build on the student's knowledge"" but rather to give all information about a given cocept right from the beginning. Thus, I am taught how to personalise the user interface and use XREFs (external references) before I am told how to create even the simplest of objects.I am an experienced 3D analylist, with knowledge of CAD and GIS, so I am not the least experienced of readers on this topic. Even so I found it frequently infuriating to attempt to learn this software using this book."
2,The word Bible attracts attention... clever marketing.,"The book covers a great deal of 3d max. But I was looking for instructions on how to make something glow once, so I thought of Render Post, Max's lens effects UI. I looked at the book and it had a ""tiny"" and yes I mean ""tiny"" section on Render Post. Absolutely nothing endepth.So if you're looking for a great all around book that has small pieces of most aspects inside Max, (not every thing and endepth in everything like I thought it might be because of the word Bible) this book is the ticket."
3,A must for Yes Fanatics,I finaly got this and I am happy with it.I still think this should have been on the Lost Broadcast DVD since it is only 26 minutes long but I only paid half price so thats the story in part. It is nice to have this since I seem to becoming a complete ist in regards to Yes.Great to see them young and at the beggining.
5,The most practical book on Internet based training in print.,"I believe I have read practically every book on Web/Internet Training-Education and ""Designing Web-Based Training"" is head and shoulders above the rest.The instruction provided in this book breaks down the many various skills and considerations in designing online training/education clearly and logically. It then supports these concepts with practical examples.Combining the book with the accompanying website is the best example of coordinating print and Web based instruction I have seen. Together they provide an excellent resource to draw ideas from.Do yourself and those you intend to deisgn Web based training/education and read this book BEFORE you start your own Web-Based training. Remember the mantra, ""Content is King"". Mr. Horton has provided an excellent example of this guiding principle."
5,Perfect Crash Course on Web-Based Training,"If you are new to web-based training, stepping into a new web-based instructional design position, have been teaching or developing web-based training but suspect that there is a better way to do it, or you simply want to establish a solid foundation in building engaging online learning envrionments, this book must be on your shelf. I am a higher education instructional design consultant and I find this book to be an excellent ongoing resource. Not only is it full of specific and practical tips, but the content is organized into dozens of useful tables and charts. Chapter 6, ""Activate Learning"" is an especially useful chapter, providing lists of potential learning activities and explaining some of the reasons to choose one learning activity over another.This is a book that emaphsizes matters of pedagogy and instructional design rather than the technical side of things. Among books with a similiar empahsis I place it among the top 10%."
5,One of the best,"Horton's book is practical, without pretentious language and of invaluable assistance to someone starting at the beginning. I work in Africa and WBT faces some serious challenges in such a poor continent. What Horton's book does, is give you a wide range of options from the simple to the complex. Choose your staring point. It has been invaluable for a beginner in this field."
4,Designing Web-Based Training,Designing Web-Based Training: How to Teach Anyone Anything Anywhere AnytimeGreat text book! Great value.Lots of sound ideas!
2,In need of revision and editing,"While fairly comprehensive (at times too much so), this book is sorely in need of a new edition. I think technology-based ""how-to"" books that remain in publication/circulation subject themselves to this type of scrutiny. You shouldn't buy a book on this topic that is not in touch with the latest technology. I understand that theory also plays a large role here, but web-based training opportunities move at the pace of technology, particularly in the corporate world. If you're trying to supplement your training, or learn about web-based training from the bottom up, you'll want a guide that is familiar with the latest and greatest. As is, this isn't currently that."
4,Almost as good as Fortnum and Mason,"This is very good tea. We were introduced to F&M Royal Blend tea on a trip to London, but it is not available in the U.S. After that brand, this is the next best thing."
5,Yorkshire Tea Bags,"Rich flavor and consistent.It's hard to find a good tea bag in the States; others fall short, no real tea flavor. Others too weak!"
5,Best book on this topic,"Most teachers and school administrators recognize that they rely heaviliy on paraeducators for the success of inclusive education. Unfortunately, many paraeducators have vague job descriptions, inadequate preparation, and poor supervision, and as a result, have difficulty fulfilling their roles. Pickett and Gerlach propose strategies to address these needs proactively. If this book were put into practice in schools, most issues with paraeducators could be eliminated."
4,"it takes a while, but you'll like it","This is definitely one of those CDs that ""grows"" on you. When I first heard it, I had already heard ""Strength,"" ""Chosen,"" ""Faith and Devotions,"" and ""I Am a Stranger in This Place."" By comparison, I didn't like this one so much; however, I gave it some time (since it's The Violet Burning), and now I listen to it quite often. My favorite moments: The really cool opening of ""Ilaria"" (though that's a song that's liable to turn off some of VB's Christian fans), and the subtly beautiful way ""Robot Fluide Robot"" segues into ""Gorgeous"" which then slides into ""Seamonster"" which then fades into a low-tech worship chorus (just strummed guitar and vocals). What a lovely way to end the recording. Overall, however, if you are a new VB fan, I'd recommend any of the other recordings mentioned first--pick up this one later."
3,Get something else,"The wireless connection drops frequently, and there is need to reconnect using my wireless card to restore the connection. This is especially frustrating when I am working from home and have to log on again to the office network. VOIP setup needs extra work. However, wired connection is quite good and the router goes on indefinitely without requiring reboot."
1,Junk,"It worked for a while. HOWEVER, it keeps disconnecting and reconnects itself with my cable modem! so I retunred it and got a new one, and it does the same thing now. I tested with my good ol' Netgear, D-link and linksys and it works perfectly. what a piece of junk. im going to smash it with a hammer this time instead of returning it."
1,Not a good experience,"I purchased this product on Sep 2, 2005, along with the XJACK 3Com wireless card (3CRXJK10075). The router worked with my hardwired (ethernet) equipment right out of the box. However, it intermittently disconnects from my cable modem. I upgraded the firmware to the latest version (2.01.05) and it still disconnects me frequently.Support was HORRIBLE. When attempting to register this product on the 3Com site, it inserted a purchase date of 12/13/2004 for me, and it wouldn't let me change it. Since it's warranty is only 90 days their system thinks my warranty expired and it won't even let me open up a support case online.Even though they claim 24/7 support, I work, so I tried fixing this problem on a Saturday. I get their friendly support staff in India who can basically do nothing for me except to tell me to call back on Monday during regular business hours.I work in IT. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Excellent,"The range is perfect for my necesities and I cant complain about the security, sometimes i need to unplug the router cause I lost the the internet connection, but I believe is my provider...If you want the best one this is it!!!, I ve bought this one several times for different networks and it never cause me any problems...."
3,Unnecessarily Cold,"I've owned a wonderful box turtle, Pete, for three years. I've found this book to be useful for troubleshooting, and I do appreciate what it says about children who are given turtles and don't know how to handle them. But I object to the book's stance that turtles are best thought of as specimens to look at but not interact with. We pick our turtle up every day and kiss him goodnight every night. Handling doesn't stress him; in fact, he often naps on my shoulder. He is our pet and a member of our family, and we all seem to enjoy interacting with each other."
5,Hot Pair of Shoes,I have never gotten so many compliments on a pair of shoes. They look great with a pair of jeans and also with a nice suit.
3,Out of stock,"Ordered 9 days ago, just got email saying Updated delivery estimate: April 13 - April 22. And it was in stock when ordered. And they should have emailled me a week ago, so I would not have wasted this week waiting, idiots don't want my business"
1,A Big Loser,"I used this tool for about two weeks. Previous reviewer said you cant get metal cutting wheels for it he is wrong, they are readily available at every home center and hardware store- standard 4.5 inch metal cutting wheels.This tool totally sucks, battery life is horrible I cut 3 pieces of 1/2 rebar and the battery was spent. I cut thru 18gagesheet metal and the battery lasted less than 40 seconds.All the metal shavings you cut get magnetically attached to the tool body and get sucked into the motor, which will lead to disaster.Also for cutting applications the handle faces the wrong way and is not comforable to use.BADDDD tool!!!!!!1"
3,Dated,"This book consists of stories published between 1923 and 1930 and were assemble as a book in 1958.I can easily understand why Dashiell Hammett was so revered as a crime/thriller writer in his day but, sadly, the stories and the language are so dated that for me,they affect the impact and enjoyment of the tale.They read like the film noir movies of the 40's and 50's with expressions such as ""dames"" and ""slapping on the bracelets"" etc.I gave up after the first two stories as they were starting to appear amusing to me and I didn't want to spoil my memories of this particular genre."
3,Seven Continentl Op stories,"These are some of the earliest of Hammet's stories featuring the unnamed 'Continental Op'. The stories are:The Tenth ClewThe Golden HorseshoeThe House in Turk StreetThe Girl With the Silver EyesThe Whosis KidThe Main DeathThe Farewell MurderMost of them are good, but the only one that approaches the excellence of the the Continental Op novels ('Red Harvest' and 'The Dain Curse')is 'the Main Murder'. In this story Hammet displays his talent for creating memorable secondary characters and crackling dialogue."
3,best doll,"this is one of the best dolls my daughter has, unforuntely some sellers have been taking advantage of Amazon not carrying this product, I bought this doll on sale here for 6.95! beware of the sellers trying to rip you off, the most this doll is worth is about 15.00."
1,Not worth the time nor the money...,"Other reviewers share my opinion that this novel is weak in capturing readers' interest in the historical aspects of its theological theme. However, in contrast to other opinions, I found the ""suspense and adventure"" of this ""thriller"" uninspired and formulaic. Even the copy editors evidently lost interest in the book: The grammatical howlers in the final pages show that folks who read the galley proofs fell asleep too soon!"
1,Good Solid Mediocre,"This really is not that good of a book. It starts out slow, speeds up very well about mid way through, then hits a serious wall when it should be climaxing. We run into old tired wishful thinking that some manuscript is going to bring down the Catholic church. (I am not a Catholic) The amount of time spent on a totally fictitious parchment that the author evidently desperately wishes existed really made finishing the book hard work for me. Jonathan Rabb is not Clancy or Grisham. The good news is that his books are only about half as long as theirs are."
3,light or medium duty?,"I wish some of the buyers of this set would say whether all of the clamps are the light-duty 2-1/2"" throat style, or are some of them the medium-duty 5-1/2"" or heavy-duty 7"" throat? And are they the TG Professional Series with the profiled rail, or the Jobsite Series with the flat rail? I assume, for this bargain price, that all 30 clamps are the 2-1/2"" throat. The small picture seems to reinforce this, but it's hard to tell.Any help from you happy buyers?(I had to rate the item to post this, so I gave it a neutral 3 stars.)"
5,Packaging Issue Addressed & Corrected,"I would like to thank DK, the author of the earlier review, for making us aware of the inadequate packaging associated with our Tradesman 30 PC. Bar Clamp Set. I am a direct employee for Bessey and, as you know, QUALITY has been our focus for over 50 years. Not just in the products we manufacture, but also in the way we go to market, our employees, and of course, the packaging of our products. I would like all to know that we have addressed this issue and have corrected the problem. I am confident that the next Amazon customer who purchases a Bessey product will be delighted, not only with the quality of our clamps, but the quality of our packaging as well."
4,poor packaging,"Received these clamps in two heavy duty boxes. Both boxes were split out from the weight of the clamps. some had minor damage to the red portion and to the handles. several had the clamp pads knocked off and missing through the end of the boxes. Several also had the pads broken and split from the treatment. Plastic tape used to seal the boxes, could not hold up to the weight and split apart at the seams.Great clamps tho."
3,"Good product, bad packaging","I cannot fault the clamps themselves as they are very well made and a quality product. However, the issues that I and it appears many others have as well, is the packaging. I read a comment that was put up by the company responsible that they had changed to 2 separate boxes instead of one. This has only slightly improved how they look when they arrive. As the corners of both boxes had been busted open by the clamps inside. It looked like the clamps had been put into two piles, had a single piece on bubble wrap placed on top of them (not around, on top!) then wrapped with some thin cardboard which was then taped up to resemble a box. I'm sure there would be occasions where they packaging has failed completely because of they shoddy way they are wrapped. It's a shame that such a good product is let down by something as simple as a bit packaging."
4,Another good Star Wars Book,"I felt a little disappointed reading this book after Outbound Flight, however Timothy Zahn could scribble non-sense and I would think its Sci-Fi Gold. Dark Lord is definitely a good book, and goes deeper into the more human side of the turned and mangled Darth Vader as he copes with his new mechanical body. This is, once again, one of those books where the Jedi seemed less important, and Darth Vader was definitely the center of attention in this story line. I had to admit not really caring what happened to the Jedi as they go throughout their story, and wanted to read more about the Dark Lord himself. I think I hold all Star Wars books up to the caliber of the Thrawn trilogy, and I think I will always let myself down in that respect, but overall, the story is good and I did enjoy this book."
4,Better than expected,"After seeing so many mediocre Star Wars books that you have to be a huge fan to appreciate, I of course was skeptical of ""Dark Lord"". But I am happy to say it is an overall good book. Yes, there are a few ""rough"" spots, but all in all well written and thought out. It's cool to kinda get inside Darth Vader's head and find out what emotions led to his dark transfer. Not to mention the fall of the Wookie home world, Kaashyyk! If you enjoyed the movies, that's all you need to enjoy this book. Well worth it."
4,dark lord: the rise of darth vader,"Well this book gave a great deal of insight into what happened to Vader after episode 3. The detail and description of Darth Vader's iconic suit and, his trouble with his new sith garb, was a new avenue of Star Wars. Plus the peek into the relationship between Master and apprentice in regards to Sith lords was worth the price of the book. Anyone who is a true Star wars fan will be pleased with the storyline. The introduction of many well known characters is interesting, and not corny. James Luceno is a great Star Wars writer, he deals with underlying issues of characters that can't be touched in the movies. I look forward to future books that deal with the early years of the Rebellion, and more rogue Jedi. This book is a must buy, and with it coming in paperback it's even more desirable. Star Wars fans sit back and enjoy this snipet of Star Wars lore brought to you by a masterful story teller, James Luceno. My only desire is to see this book become a movie."
2,Very disappointed,"I got this book because it was titled the Rise of Darth Vader. Instead what I got was The Flee of the Remaining Jedi. Darth Vader is in this book but a handfull of times. Since this book is entitled the Rise of Darth Vader one would expect the book to be about Darth vader and his Rise to power as the second in command in the whole galexy. But unfortunately it's not. Over all I was very disappointed in this book. The darth vader character has been my favorite character in the whole Star Wars saga. I hope that books about his life to follow have more to do with him than other characters. If you are interested in Reading this book, you won't learn anything about him that you don't already know. You get no new information about who he has become and what is now driving him. If you noticed in the second starwars movie how much of a baby Anikin is, nothing has changed. Save yourself the few hours of reading time and pick something else."
1,Darklord A Dark Disappointment,"Where Labyrinth captued the heart and sole of the characters, its plot racing us to the opening of Episode III as fast as I could turn the pages-Dark Lord was a huge disappointment- I had to make myself finish it and was left wondering why this book was such a stark contrast in writing and depth for Luceno."
2,Not that good.,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. Didn't know what to expect, but kind of was thinking along a bigger timeline. I did like the fact that Vader was still thinking and complining like Anakin while at the same time Vader was also growing.Didn't like the other characters in the book. The Jedi that survived and the smugglers that helped. I didn't really care what happened to them, who survivied or how who died. Very poor character development there.My other big gripe is that this book pretty much starts and ends within weeks of the end of the Clone Wars. Like I said earlier, I was expecting to cover more time wise."
3,Not as good as Revenge of the Sith,"The book was interesting but unremarkable.It's interesting to see Anakin's further personal development (his progression further into the dark side), although since his disfigurement at the end of the revenge of the Sith he has been significantly neutered (as evidenced by his being repeatedly wounded by average Jedi).That being said the further revelations concerning the pathological relationship between Sith Master and Apprentice was interesting, as well as the introduction of the Moff's but the rest of the book was relatively dull.If you really must know what happened between revenge of the Sith and A new hope, go ahead and read this book, but I wouldn't buy it."
2,Not for a diehard fan,"I am a die hard Star Wars fan, I have been one since Episode 4 in 1977, I had great hopes for this and there is so much that could Luceno could have done with this book.The plot is bland and not very interesting, when the action does get going Luceno switches to some character of not much interest or value.This book really is not about Vader but about some remaining Jedi and then a little bit of Vader mixed in.In all I was disappointed in this one,hopefully any other author who attempts to write about this crucial period in Star Wars history will get it right."
4,hey,i thought this book was good. not as good as revenge of the sith. a must read for star wars fans.
4,"Fun, better than most SW novels, easy read.",I have read almost all of the SW universe novels... this one wasnt bad... pretty fun and brainless adventure story. This was by-far one of the better SW novels I've read.
3,I am still waiting to see when Darth Vader will be powerful.,"Overall entertaining read, although I think any book written about a between film hallmark Lucas character has a Very Very restricted story line. I'm sure Luceno did what he could with the character, but ultimately I feel like something is missing. I was expecting to see why the galaxy feared Vader, but mostly just saw his increasing limitations. Anakin/Darth Vader a Sith creation supposedly has the most Force potential, but all he really does is throw stuff and choke? I guess I was hoping for a bit more than Vader angst. It is ingenious how Luceno tries to work with Vader's limitations, especially describing in a justifying way the limited movie props of the 70's i.e. Vader's suit and empire space craft. Worth a read."
4,Good book. I'd recommend picking it up.,Pretty good book. I was suprised that I enjoyed it to be honest. It picks up after revenge of the sith and shows anakin becoming vader in mind body and soul. The book would have been better if the characters he was fighting against were in any way interesting. They are just shallow characters to get pimped slaped by vader.
5,Intricate memories of a Lord Long Past,I was enthralled with this book. It opened up thoughts about and questions that I had about Vader and why he would blindly follow the emperor and never fight back. I'm hoping they do more of these books because it bridges a gap in the story line that seems so interesting to me and I would assume so many other Star Wars fans.
4,Great follow-up to RotS!,"It's been a while since I read this book but I thoroughly enjoyed it and James Luceno is easily my favorite SW author. The writing style makes this story quite vivid and easy to follow. My only real critique with this book is that the title implies the story is to primarily revolve around Vader, which for the most part it doesn't (and the same can be said about the title character in Luceno's newest book Darth Plagueis). I don't feel this takes away from the overall enjoyment of the book very much, hence only giving it a one-star reduction, but a bit more exposure on Vader and the Purge would've been nice. One part covered in the book that I felt should've been more widespread considering the bond that is formed during combat was during Order 66 some of the clones allowed their general or commander to escape. I realize there is mention of this in a couple other books but this occurance is more realistic than Karen Traviss's handling of the situation IMHO."
5,Great Sequel to Revenge of the Sith!!,Luceno did a great job! ORDER 66's aftermath was something I was itching to read about as I just knew there would be Clone Troopers who might REFUSE Order 66! (Commandos of course!)Great story worthy of a movie (if Lucas would make it for TV!)-Ken Knight~(author of THE MIDNIGHT OIL)
2,Disappointing bridge for the Saga,"Maybe I expected too much, having enjoyed James Juceno's other works, or maybe I expected too much from such an well-titled novel set during the gap between the SW Saga's 2 film trilogies.Ultimately, I found this a weakly written story with no real contribution to the Star Wars film series continuity or to that of the books. Also the author/publisher's jacket color choices are too similar to the novelization of Episode 3, probably generating some confusion-based sales (leaving no doubt disappointed buyers)."
4,It started off slow....,but it did begin to pick up. It got to be a real intreging story. A must read for any Star Wars fan and any Darth Vader fan. It talks about Vader's early days and his sdjustment to his new life.
4,I liked this book but it could have been a little better,"I think James Luceno is a decent Star Wars writter but I wouldn't say he's my favorite by any means. I thought this book did an adequate job showing you what happened after Revenge of the Sith and does a decent job showing you the struggles Darth Vadar has with his new body and his new responsibilities as the Emperor's new ""enforcer"". The remaining jedi that he encounters in this book are mostly forgetable. I didn't even feel bad when some of them were killed off.I really like reading about the Clone Wars books with a young Anakin, ObiWon, Mace, Yoda and the gang must more than I do about Luke, Han etc and this book has a good story, a good plot and it's written well enough. It isn't however a page turner and it will be easily forgotten with some of the other books out there.It's what a call a good library book. It's definitely not a go out and buy and read over and over again book."
3,Disappointing - Not Enough on Vader,"While the book was okay, I was disappointed overall in this book. There are only about 5 chapters that are worthwhile. The book gets a very slow start detailing the back story on characters we have never heard of before - not Darth Vader - and you have to go through 8 Chapters before it even mentions what the book was supposed to be about - The Rise of Darth Vader and his subsequent mindset, thoughts or regrets about his unwise choice."
4,Decent follow up to Episode III,"I just finished reading this and enjoyed it for the most part. Like many other Star Wars books this might not satisfy casual fans. However, it does go into detail about what happened four weeks after Episode III and Vader's experiences. The author did a good job showing him to be awkward at first but developing over time to at the end of the book showing the first hints of the classic cinematic villain he is in the original trilogy. The writing does lose its ""Star Wars"" feel in some places but not too many. This book also shows what is happening politically in the galaxy with most characters from Episode III shown. The relationship between Palpatine and Vader is explored and I found that too be very interesting as it shows both of their thoughts towards each other. I do hope that Luceno writes another book continuing the events in this one."
4,Just What I Needed,"This is a perfect sequel to Episode III. I have read some of the other reviews stating that people were disappointed that Darth Vader is not mentioned early on in the book. So what! When he does arrive, it just makes it even more worthwhile to read.I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish. After just finishingStar Wars: Darth Plagueis, this was a perfect book to start. Both books are by Lucerno, who by the way, should write ALL Star Wars expanded universe books from now on. He just gets the way the books should be.The only problem with this book is that, after I finished reading it, I am sort of lost on what SW book I should get next. Does anyone have any suggestions? I am looking to continue where this book left off."
3,good but slow,"Dark Lord is a good solid Star Wars novel, better than many. It also fills in many vital elements of what happen to Darth Vader after Revenge of the Sith and before A New Hope. There are reasons why he developed the way he did and helps to develop the man in the suit. That being said the novel can be very slow and plodding in parts. If you are willing to grit your teeth and keep reading there is a great story in there. But not everyone will be willing to drive on, and shouldn't have to. It could be better, but it isn't a waste of time either."
2,Don't Bother,"Don't bother to read this tome. James Luceno has transformed one of the most darkest and villainous bad-guy into a whimpering, whining cry-baby. I read the book praying that the story-line would get better; it doesn't. Not even worth while reading for diehard fan-atics."
4,Pretty good,"I would have preferred a little more time spent on Anakin's evolution into Darth Vader. Too much time centered around the Jedi Roan Shryne and his story line. I would recommend it for the Star Wars fan, as it still tries to explain the transformation of Vader."
2,Disappointed,"My son loves this mobile. He stares at it and smiles and laughs. The disappointing thing about this item is that now the song no longer plays. I have replaced the batteries twice and it still does not work. The mobile will spin and one button works so the blue light and the nature sound comes on. However, it was the song that my son loved. We have not used this item very often. Maybe only a few times a day during diaper changes or before a nap or bedtime. We have only had it a couple of months. I am very disappointed that it does not work after such short period oftime."
5,Lot's of fun.,This mobile is great! I bought it for my daughter at three months and she loves it. Her first real laugh was at this toy. She loves the music and lights. She really loves it when you make Piglet squeek and Eeyore's ears crunch.
1,Unsafe,I bought it on base and ended up taking it back...It's heavy and the caracters are only attached byt a little unstable piece of velcro...Also mine didn't work...
2,Not as good as you might think,"Ok so its got 4 fans, and small vents to cool. However it dose not cool as efficiently as some of the 2 fan coolers I have had. Kept my HDD temp 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit, HOTTER than some other coolers. And just like others, it will get a great amount of dust buildup witch you have to clean out alot, and will eventually just get noisy to the point is sounds like something is getting chopped up in there. Flimsy construction too, not recommended for traveling usage as it will get crushed in your bag. Also has an annoying LED light on the front to let you know its on, very bright at night. Also has a small thumb wheel so you can adjust the speed of the fans, however it still just dosent go high enough."
3,Average cooler,"As a long-time, hard-core laptop user, the Evercool Notebook Pad was among the more forgettable models in my eternal search to find the perfect pad. First of all, the construction is flimsy and the plastic fittings are brittle. It did not do much to conduct heat away from my laptop bottom at all, and wasn't very comfortable to place in my lap either.The fans ended up giving out after about 10 months and I thankfully threw it in the trash.Not recommended. For a truly effective cooler, check out Antec's offerings."
4,Great Value,"Pros: Light weight, On/off switch, four fans, high-low speed. The four fans offer a wider cooling area than other cooling pads. I have a dv2000 HP which has vents for the hardware that most pads do not consider.Cons: A little louder than I expected. The four fans do not run at a whisper at its highest speed but it's not loud enough to be a nuisance. I do not think they are ball bearing fans which are much quieter. The plastic casing is decently built but the horizontal vents are a little flimsy.I've been using the NP101 for at least a month and haven't had any problems with it. In my opinion, it works great. I took a lot of time comparing other cool pads and ended up liking this one."
3,Pretty good cooler,"Pros: Price, Works really well in keeping my laptop cool, 4 fans, on/off and fan speed switches, low soundCons: Feels cheap, doesn't fit on my laptop that well, small for larger laptops, fans are weaker than my old coolerOverall it is a pretty nice cooler. Even though the fans are weak, there are 4 of them and it still does a great job cooling my laptop. This cools better than my old cooler. The laptop moves alittle bit on it but not enough to annoy me to not use it plus I have a big XPS laptop so it would probably work better on smaller ones. For the price, it is a good cooler pad! This pad keeps my GPU from the red zone which my other cooler could not do. I'm really happy with the performance of this cooler!"
1,Cooling pad makes Blood Boil,I'm on my second one of these in less than 2 years. The second one lasted a shorter amount of time than the first one. The problem is the wire that plugs into the USB plug is made so cheaply that they keep braking off. Yes it has 4 fans but they don't work without power. I don't recommend this one at all.Jackie
2,Fair,"Well, I thought that this product would cool down my notebook, but I think it only had a marginal effect, and that was only when the fans were at maximum speed."
1,Horrible description,"Horrible Description...Seeing how the poster of this item left out important facts, Im now stuck with this seat cover that is shaggier then a long hair dog...Its like one of those stupid halloween black costume wigs...How can this prevent dog hair, It collects even more dog hair then my uncovered seat...If you cant do anything correctly then dont do it at all!"
4,easy and quiet water cooling,"Used to overclock a amd 165 cpu to 2.5 gig hz @1.41vdc 38 deg c. runing the fan at 1100 rpm.Power supply makes more noise than cpu cooling. takes about 30 min to setup. take your time I've done twosetups , good kit."
3,rest in peace,purchased jan 2006failed june 2nd 2009fan no longer spinsthinking of replacing fantwo things i noticed:1) this unit requires you to remove the universal bolts for the heatsink on your motherboard for itsheatsink. 3 years later i do not know where those parts are! so i dunno what to do nowmaybe i can find a spare pentium 4 heatsink universal socket2) i don't see any mention of a warranty on coolermaster's website or in the instruction manual
4,Excellent for beginers,"This is an excellent book for beginers. The book is thorough yet simple and the reader can easily understand Taguchi methods, the moethodology as well as the overall necessity of using it. I would recommend to any one who wants to use Taguchi methods. Its especially suited for beginers."
4,A primer on the Taguchi Method,"Very good, informative, with good examples, following the same authors statistical package ""Qualitek - 4"" book on the Taguchi method."
2,"Sour taste, unpleasant purpose","A very unusual book. There are a number of stories that concern a main character whose personal troubles give him illumination into the larger troubles of society. This book is unusual in that:-- the main character is a sour, depressed member of an old local aristocracy that has lost its power and prestige-- in his opinion, the troubles with society are the lack of chivalrous values and a sense of mission.The book takes on the pompous and self-pitying tone of its main character, and the points it makes about society seem so... well, conservative, even fuddy-duddy and irrelevant... that it makes you wonder if the author really means it or if he's trying to portray something. If the author really does mean it, then I wish he had drawn a character I had a little sympathy for. The personal problems just don't have must drama, and Lancelot Lamar himself is just not... that... exciting..."
2,only +1 40S&W,"was shiped in a timely manner but it only holds +1 .40cal, dont know about 9mm but if current size were relevant then id guess it would only hold +2 9mm, also dinged another star for overall design. to remove it you have to ""snap"" it off by pushing in the button with a punch, sliding the plate back and applying either left or right ward pressure until it snaps off. when a g 22 15rd mag with this base plate installed is compared to a glock .40 cal 22round factory mag, the 22 round mag is only about 1/2 inch longer. save your money and order a glock 22 round factory mag if you can get them, other wise 16rds is better than 15."
5,one of Valdez's best,"This movie is not only good because of the several funny gags but it is also because of the cast. A slim Tin-tan looks great as a Pachuco king with a double life: honest workman and gang leader. Silvia Pinal just looks gorgeous. Clearly at her prime. Maybe the acting is not the best one but it is well suited for this easy-going comedy. Director Gilberto Martinez-Solares brings some innovation into this movie involving the actors into a dialogue with the audience. I have never seen another movie of this time showing up this. Could it be said that this movie-audience interaction is an introduction of this director. Aside of technical details, this is a great comedy of the so-called 'Golden Age' of Mexican cinema. Something that should be in the collection of all those interested in the filming of that time in Latin America."
3,good product egg try,"Good productdo not let them ship in plastic bag,my 1st order 1 was cracked i did not notice untill i got them to send the second one,that was totally broke.they sent new one i should of got them to replace both."
1,"""rotten egg tray","I should have realized the quality of the product by its cost. Plastic is not what I wanted, therefore it did not meet my expectations. Perhaps a better discription of the tray would have prevented my purchase of it."
3,bulk purchasing denied so only expect the one you see,"I liked this tray when I first saw it and I tried to buy several others, but apparently my order was not able to be processed. Several times I called and called yet nobody picked up the phone at the deviled egg plant. I then tried the paprika factory, where a man informed me that this operation was totally separate to the making of the plastic trays, which I find to be a bit beguiling, considering the trays are made specifically for deviled eggs, AND that paprika is the key ingredient(ask anybody). As for the trays they are great, can be used as frisbees or sleds in the winter for your pets. Do not try to use them in the stove, or to make plastic casts of anything. And, do not try to order one thousand of them at a time. You can only buy five every half an hour, this will take you a long time if you go through them like I do. Cheers."
3,average tray,"Hard plastic tray cracked in the middle where you normally put dip. I can still use it to hold veggies, though. This product should be carried for less money at a dime store."
4,New and creative,"This was more creative than I expected it to be. Not the best story or cast, except Arielle Kebbel was very good. It's at least different than other films."
3,odd... very odd,"Reeker is quite the unique horror flick.It's not scary at all, the acting is pretty bad all around, the characters are completely uninteresting, the suspense build-up misses the mark completely... and yet I don't hate the movie.I can't explain it. It's a real mystery why I'm giving this movie as high of a rating as I am. It probably deserves a lower rating.Something about the low budget feel of the entire movie sort of works in its favor instead of against it. It's like the movie isn't trying to be the scariest movie ever, and it knows its using all the same cliches other similar types of movies have been using for years, and it just rolls along at a nice enough pace to keep you guessing.The storyline might be the one thing that saves it above everything else. Five people stranded at a small gas station in the middle of the desert where some rather odd things have been taking place there.Strangely appealing is the best way to describe this one."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"The majority of this film is your typical, basic, B-horror movie formula. That is, lots of gore, good looking people, and very bad acting. For most of this movie, I was unimpressed, thinking that it wasn't bad enough to turn off, but wasn't good enough to ever see again. I decided to finish it and that's when I got hit with one of the best endings I have seen in any horror film ever! I never even had a clue that it was coming. It tied up all the loose ends and weird things that I had just associated with it being a B-movie. Like I said, the acting is nothing special, the story is nothing different, and for the most part this film is ""OK"", but that ending, I just can't get it out of my mind, it really makes this one worth seeing."
5,It is packed full of mystery and intrigue!!,"Greg Donegan did an excellent job in writing this book. I was hooked by just reading the summary on the back. It has the most of what I like: mystery, intrigue, and suspense. Also how he tied the age old mystery of ""Atlantis"" and ""The Bermuda Triangle"" was well written. The plot had a great flow and rappid pace. From start to finish I found it irresistable to put down. A real by the edge of your seat adventure. I have read the Area 51 series and this series (if it has more than a part two) will give it a good run for its money!! I am anxious for the sequels."
2,Who edited this book?,"I found it hard to get through the book. The story itself is good and the concept is very compelling. Unfortunately the numerous spelling, and grammar errors kept me from enjoying the over all ""flow"" of the story. I was only able to make it through a couple of chapters in the next book before seeing even more errors including, one case where the name Dane was substituted with Thorpe.Over-all the spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors compel me to wonder who edited these books."
3,"The idea is good, the writing is not.","I actually have the version of the book published by Berkley Fiction under the pen name ""Greg Donegan"". I like the idea of the series, but the author's writing style is very simple and boring. This could have been an excellent book if the author expanded on details and thoughts."
4,Interesting read,"Fast read. The story is interesting. The suspense is great in the begining. However, the ending is somewhat disapointing."
2,A Laughably Bad Book,"There's not much more to be said. The writing is laughably poor and painfully cliched. The plot is incoherent, the premise interesting but poorly researched and executed. A shining example of generic, uninspired fantasy."
2,"Atlantis, Area 51 and Other Sure Winners","Any book with ""Atlantis,"" the ""Bermuda Triangle,"" ""Area 51"" and similar others are almost guaranteed sci fi readers' interest. Despite its title, however, this book really doesn't have anything to do with Atlantis (or A51 or BT). Yeah, the island is mentioned here and there - but if you think you're going to read something that sheds any light on or even focuses on the subject, forget it. The title is really just a writer's hook. And it's not a particularly well written book at that. I don't think it's even worth the $.99 price!I bought the kindle version and it seemed to be well translated from its original form - that's worth 2 stars."
4,Atlantis [Kindle Edition],"I was concerned about the comments about bad Kindle formatting. Having just completed reading the book on the Kindle, here is what I found.1. The title of the book is misspelled on the title page!! (as ALTANTIS)2. The word ""insure"" is used twice where ""ensure"" should have been used.3. There are numerous improper line breaks that occur mid-sentence.4. The word ""hundred"" is misspelled as ""hunred"" once.5. The most annoying problem is that are many scene changes, sometimes occurring after only two or three paragraphs, without any mark or break in the text to indicate this.All things considered, though, well worth the .99."
3,a good read for 99 cents,"here is a very short review.i purchased the kindle edition of this book. for 99 cents you cant go wrong if you want a good action story.what i didnt like...the characters are very cliche. ive seen these characters in every hollywood action movie ive ever seen. im assuming thats the point though.the book is too short to really get too ""deep."" the entire story seems like it is explained then unfolded very quickly. again, maybe this is the point. i prefer very long books with lots of detail.what i did like...interesting story overall. a different take on the bermuda triangle and what it is.technology being used to solve mysteries of an ancient evil? pretty neat stuff.im a sucker for series, and the first book sets up the reader for more. im cool with that.not horribly deep, sorta superficial, but an interesting read. for a buck you cant beat it."
3,Good book.,"Not a great book, but it kept me turning pages after I should have been in bed. Only real problem I had was with the scenes involving submarines - Mr Donegan obviously knows nothing about them. Other than that, it was definitely worth the cost, and I'm looking forward to a sequel."
2,Average bestseller,"Here's an example of a reasonably well executed thriller - I'd really rate it 2 1/2 stars. Donegan makes use of most of the classic elements: high concept, tight deadlines and effective use of scene jump cutting and multiple points of view to ratchet up the suspense and keep the story moving. The use of a dog in the plot is relatively fresh and interesting. However, there are some spots where the book falls down. Characterization is weak - all the villians are pure evil with no other reedeming characteristics, so their actions and reactions are quite predictable. His science and technology aren't up to snuff either, I found numerous errors in his explanations of devices (for example the color of light does not affect the speed of propogation, only the density of the transit medium does - which makes the Bright Eye device bogus) which jarred me out of my suspension of disbelief. Aside from these distractions, the book is reasonably executed and an entertaining light read."
2,Nothing Special,"The plot sounded good, but it's really pathetically weak and full of holes. No decent character development. No real suspense. Not a well thought out premise. An easy read, but there are a lot of better books of this genre out there."
2,Tech tramples story,"Typical of Mayer books, there is more descriptions of guns weapons of mass destruction than story - and a weak story line at that."
5,Worth paying for...,"Great book...left me wanting more for sure. I read a lot, and an excellent book 1 in a series that makes you want to run out and buy all the others in the series at one go is rare and hard to come by...excellent job guys.... I'll be buying the rest."
4,Decent read,Reminds me of sigma force series by Rolland's. Interesting take on Atlantis. Entertaining and worth while read on a lazy day :)
2,Last third is junk,"Ok, appears a lot of people are fans of the author(s) and series. I'm a newbie, and this will be my last. First 2/3 of the book was a good 3.5 stars, despite the fact that the author could never really present a good tangible description of the 'others'. Then wow, the last bit of the book was fractured, disjointed, called for something beyond a suspension of disbelief, and it almost seemed like it was in a hurry to end itself. Very disappointing."
1,Puts me to sleep every night,"Here I am, 2/3 of the way through this book, and the story is just starting to maybe get off the ground... Maybe! I can' t wait anymore for it to finally get going! I'm pulling my hair out and my mind is starting to daydream as I read! Most good books I've read have a setup of the story and then you're off! At this point in the book, I'm begging the characters to get moving and get on with it. This is NOT suspense, it's utter frustration!"
3,Proof reading please!,"I've read many of Bob Mayer's books before and enjoyed them. I am half way through the Gate series and it's a good read BUT the proof reading is non-existent and it effects the readability of the text greatly in some places. I don't know if it's Mr. mayer's, fault or Amazon's bit it's not acceptable. It's so bad on occasions that it takes 3-4 read throughs to understand what's actually being written. I don't care that this is an ebook format, no-one paying for a book should have to accept that poor level of quality. You certainly wouldn't with a printed copy. Proof read before publishing please!"
5,Have read all this authors books so far............,"have liked them all. I give this book five stars. This is an excellent book, If you like sifi thrillers."
3,"A good book, but not about Atlantis","True, this was a easy, fast read, but I was disappointed that it contained no information about Atlantis. This title must have been chosen to sell the book. In contrast, ""Atlantis: Insights From a Lost Civilization"" by Shirley Andrews is currently providing me with facts and thoughts about Atlantis."
2,Wait for the sequel or the movie.,"A fun, light read. No surprises; done before and better. Visual and effects oriented more than plot driven. Liked the strange fog. Read like a screenplay adaptation and would work better on the SciFi channel or in theaters as a 90 minute action flick. Will not stretch your mind or explain the mysteries of the world to your satisfaction."
4,A good start to a series,This book kept me intrigued and I look forward to the next book. There are a lot of characters to keep track of but the story kept moving along.
3,Not as good as expected,I bought this book after getting hooked on the Sigma Force series. It was a good book but I found it hard to keep interested and just kept reading in order to get to the end.
4,Very enjoyable,"A very good mix of genres in this book. Part sci-fi, part gritty war novel and part spy novel all wrapped together. The story is really only getting set up in this novel and so can get a little bogged down in explaining all the characters but that's fine for the first in a series. Overall an enjoyable read that is worth your time."
4,Creative and Unique,"I love sci-fi. I love the ability to take reality and tweak it. For that reason, I really liked this story. The author does an excellent job of taking what we know and then imagining more into it. I enjoyed that there was more than one main character. I loved the small walk through Cambodian history. It made me look up more on Cambodia. I love when books do that. Inspire to dig in and get more on my own. This book was great for that.If you enjoy scifi, this is a great read."
3,"Atlantis - Bob Mayer, Fun read","Fast paced, entertaining story, which is what I would expect most people that read Action/Thriller books are looking for. Editing needs improved. Many typos and grammar errors distract from the story and in a few cases bring you out of the story in confusion. Still, overall I enjoyed the story and was entertained. I will probably read the rest of the series."
5,Great Book,Great science thriller. The series is nicely written and each book has a different spin as not to bore the reader.Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
3,um plato talked about atlantis,i just wanted to point out that plato is where we get the ledgand of atlantis being destroyed. and he lived before the raoman empire. i.e before charlamagne
3,Atlantis,I liked it. The editing is a bit sketchy but what do you want for $.99? A good yarn. A bit over the top at times but I did enjoy it and have purchased the second in the series.
2,A bit too simple!,The book promised a lot based on previous readers' reviews and the publishing house's reputation but I was disappointed with its contents. The information is well presented but too simplistic. Lacking any further elaboration this book is of little use if you have some experience in the field of interactive design. A good brain-storming session at home would come up with the same findings of this book.
1,Poor excuse for house humidifier,"I have had this humidifier installed in our house for several weeks, and can only achieve a 5% improvement in humidity. The solenoid screen gets clogged very easily, and is not easily removed for cleaning. Very poor humidification for the money."
4,Frightening,I thought that this book was pretty good. It was scary without being too graphic or gory. The beginning of the book was fantastic but it lost some of its steam halfway through. It just seemed like it was saying the same thing over and over. I feel it could have been condensed a little. The pace picked up toward the end. Overall I found this book to be entertaining and would recommend it to others.
3,"OK, could have been spookier.",Ending could have been better. I felt like the story was dragging on while the ending came pretty abruptly and wasn't all that scary.
4,Joyce J. Evans - Dreamweaver MX 2004 Complete Course,"I am almost half way through this course. Out of all the books that I picked up I found this book the most clear, colourful and one of the easiest to use. The reason I am writing the review is because I saw the low score it is getting. I feel some people will miss a great opportunity in learning how to put a web page together by taking heed the rating its getting. The price might be high if your not that interested. Cheap if you push through the discomfort of making an effort and become a web designer, which you will become if you do push yourself."
3,Not too shabby.,"This book is not quite a ""complete course"" like the title says, but it is pretty good still. You just read through each section doing the little follow along projects that the author tells you how to do. The book is not that hard to follow, some of the other reviews here are a little too harsh. I am just a regular person with a little web design experience, and this book is no problem to keep up with. Overall, for the price the book is a little skimpy, but it is one of the few that when you are done you will have created a complete website, although it may be for a FAKE company and not you. I guess that all-in-all it is not the best or most informative Dreamweaver MX book out there, but it is more like a classroom experience than alot of the others, which can not ony make it easier to follow, but easier to stay interested in."
2,Cute but not well made,"I loved the look of these gloves -- but they didn't hold up at all. Wore them maybe 5 times for lifting, and they came apart on the back of the glove where the colored part meets the black. Too bad, because they are really cute!"
2,Beware,"I bought these gloves, after reading the reviews, thinking it would be a great deal. I was SO wrong, I have worn them all of three times, they are already coming apart at the seams at the wrist and on the fingers. I was so disappointed because they are so cute and fit well. I would suggest if you are a serious lifter, look for a better quality glove."
2,Go for higher quality,"These gloves were a bargain, and now I know why. The cheap material hurts my hands rather than cushions them while I'm lifting weights. I'll probably trade up for a higher quality pair."
2,short life,I have worn these gloves 2x a week for about a month and they are already ripping. Would not buy again.
4,Wear them in...,"These gloves were tight in the beginning I thought I would send them back, but then they started to stretch out and fit like a glove now!"
2,Ok,What can I expect for so little money. Cheaply made. Good fit and like color but I would not buy another pair.
3,Good but...,"The book is really good, but it's a little outdated. I thought I was getting the most recent edition (the one issued in 1997) as this was shown as the most recent version by amazon, but there was one issued in 2003, so be sure to get that one, as without that you don't get access to the authors web site."
5,How to Start a Home Based Travel Agency,Feels like the sun comes up behind the dark mountains. All questions in my mind was cleared after reading the book and I am now ready to become an independent travel agent.
4,A good conclusion...,"I enjoyed this. Unlike other reviewers, I felt it was a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The characterization of Azoun was appreciated as well as the family turmoil between him and his estranged daughter Alusair. The descriptions of the epic battle between the armies of Faerun and the Barbarian Horde were well written and gave me the feeling of actually being there. I would recommend this book as well as the preceding two."
5,Wow,I am very impressed with Rockliff's furst entry in this field. She will likely be one of the major new chilren's authors of the new century. A real keeper.
4,Very well organized book,Very good book to read once and refer to it again and again. Practical scenarios make this book different from others. I have attended workshop by Neal Whitten. It was worth attending and surely he has enough number of issues with project management.
5,Don't leave home without it!,"I am in sales and frequently travel for work. I always make sure to pack Yoga Secrets for Business Success when I plan for a trip. The stress of traveling can wear on my body, but this book offers secret tips and exercises to keep me healthy and energized while I am away from home.I recomend this book to anyone who wants to stay positive and free from stress. You can do the exercises at home or in your hotel room when you are away!There are very clear directions and pictures showing how to do each exercise.Even if you have never done any yoga, you will find you can do any exercise in this book.I am happy I found it.Andre Coveney- Divisional Sale Manager/Square D Company"
5,Absolutely brilliant!,"This is the most outstanding fan I have ever owned. Don't even worry about the negative reviews. This is just too good. Really , if you're thinking of buying a fan, see no further. 'Nuff said. Brilliant product."
3,Nice powerful fan but doesn't oscillate,"PROS:- Nice powerful fan generates strong breeze- convenient with remoteCONS:- noisy- the only downfall is that it doesn't oscillateMisc:Large fan but lightweightBasic Remote (Power, Fan Speed, and Timer function)"
1,Damaged,"Received two of these from Amazon, both with the same condition. Both of them arrived only slightly banged up, but there was absolutely no packaging to protect the fan from getting damaged. Front plastic piece was rubbing on the fan blades, only allowing them to move on the high settings. Looks like another user had the same exact issue less than a month ago; and amazon stated they would remove the item until they could figure out the issue and never did. I'm sure it would work great if it wasn't damaged, but getting two in a row that had the same problem, I wouldn't feel to confident..."
4,Good Toy,"My grandchildren enjoy playing with this set. One is just potty trained and the other is just being potty trained, so they can play pretend with the dolls and they love giving them a pretend bath too."
1,big ripoff,"first of all this book comes with cassette tapes (i don't even own a cassette player or vhs player) second it is all in spanish (not even the instructions are in english) which you might think is ok for a learning spanish book, but even if you sit down and figure out what it is saying, you don't even get the answers. you have to buy another book to get the answers!!!(32.00 up)and to add insult to injury, the other book is not available!!! and even if it was, i would be afraid to purchase it because i might get ripped off again."
1,ABURRIDO!!! - BORING!!!!,"The people that are willing to pay $50- for this CD would be wise to spend it on professional help instead. I had this CD once. I listened to it a couple of times, ut nothing in it made me think I'd ever want to hear it again. Los Tres is a truly boring band. It's even more boring on this CD as they attempt to tackle boleros, rockabilly, and cuecas to boot on the last 3 or 4 tracks. There are 2 guests on this CD, unknown to all but a small part of the Chilean population. And NO. Chile is NOT in Mexico, you ignorant gringo!...UPDATE - This CD is thankfully out of print, hopefully forever. But if you still want it, it is available through bit torrent downloads, for free. Not apenny should reach these roto chilenos for this piece of garbage."
3,Not as expected,"I bought this for my 9-year old. She has been having fun with it, but I was disappointed in the quality of the item. When the set arrived, I had to put small magnets on each piece, some of which do not stick well. The magnetic board itself is easily bent if it is not kept in the frame. The problem is that you need to remove the frame to get to the mosaic pieces. The easel provided to set the frame in is not sturdy and not easy to work with. Could have been a better product for the money."
3,D IS FOR DISASTER!,"This couple has explosive chemistry but no real basis to build a relationship. They both come from broken homes and as teenagers they sneak off to see each other. Brand leaves the state before he knows Dani's pregnant and is gone for 12 years. He returns and ends up as her renter and they take up where they left off. She wants to search for the son she gave up for adoption, Brand wants to search for his long lost father. Destiny and fate collide all at once and Dani finds out he's really the illegitimate son of the wealthiest family in the county. Brand discovers that his half-brother is really the son Dani gave up for adoption. Lots of emotions are just too neatly tied up at the end when you know there will be some severe problems for this couple in the future."
3,Nice results but awful smell,"The one minute manicure has nice results if you can get past the fact that the chocolate scent is strong and unpleasant. Also stirring it is difficult. The oil rises to the top and when you stir it, it spills over the top. Also found it extremely difficult to get the mixture out of he jar, it spills over every time and you have to get it out really fast because it separates."
4,Compelling stories of deduction,"Van Gulik's Judge Dee series are fairly unique for the unfamiliar settings and historical Chinese literature his plots are based on. Like the previous books, the good judge is again called to investigate several mysterious cases (all at once), the most interesting being the murder of a retired general in a room locked from the inside.While the cleverly-woven plots and investigations are the high point of all the books in the series, the wonderful little details of people and life in ancient China are a learning experience as well. The accuracy of these details comes as no surprise as the author was once the Dutch ambassador to China. Highly recommended for fans of classic stories of deduction."
3,Okay but....,The ebook was wonderful ... Delighted to read another Dee mystery.....BUT. The print was awful....too many typos which is odd since it was an ebook
4,chinese culture fan,"This book, offers a glimpse into chinese culture, which is the reason I enjoyed it."
1,Dull Book,"My mystery book club chose this novel and so I ordered it. Rarely do I not finish a book, but this just bored me and was written so long ago I can't imagine why it was selected. I stopped reading about 1/4 the way through, and began a new novel, one written recently, not something written a long time ago. I'm sorry to rate this ""boring"" but to me it was."
2,Not that good,"The author has a chapter called ""What is the best treatment for eczema"", you would think you will learn some very good tips to deal with it (or that is at least what I was expecting), but you don't ,she refers to the different general treatments, but doesn't tell you exactly what you could use, i.e. other books that I have read, tell you specifically to look for lotions that have colloidal oatmeal, this chapter is too general. I was expecting to find more specific advise."
1,Useless,"Perhaps this book was written for someone who never read anything about eczema. However, for any parent who conducted even minimum research this book will tell nothing new. Great cover design, promising title, waste of money."
2,"Disappointing, given the internet hype","I've been using AlphaDerma-CE for about 30 days, and the results have been underwhelming. While it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, I haven't noticed any reductions in wrinkles or damage. I'm 44 years old, and I have wrinkling around my eyes and extending from the sides of my nose, mostly due to sun exposure; however, the AlphaDerma-CE dries my skin further. As a remedy, I use moisturizer on top of the AlphaDerma, but there's no information accompanying the product regarding using moisturizers and/or makeup on top of it. Does that lessen its positive effects? Should I wait X amount of time before applying other products over it? How long before I should see some improvement in my skin? Thirty days? 60? 90? So far, I'm disappointed. I can see no reduction whatsoever in wrinkling, and perhaps a small increase, due to dryness."
1,Waste of Money,"I used StriVectin for a year and decided to try AlphaDerma. What a waste. It didn't work at all, and I lost the benefits I'd gotten from StriVectin. AlphaDerma doesn't hydrate at all, so you'll have to be sure to use a good moisturizer with it. It's really runny, not creamy at all. I quit using AlphaDerma after 2 months & went back to StriVectin. Don't bother trying AlphaDerma. It doesn't do anything."
3,Suggestion a good surce,"This is a good book on this subject. But, I'd like to suggest a very good source of Persian (Farsi) books on the net: [...]& [...] You will find any Farsi books in this feild."
1,Rip Off,"If Amazon had mentioned that this was not in fact a ""paperback"", but a bloody comic book, I would not have wasted my money on it."
1,Sad,"I blame myself, really. I should have looked closer at the page and read the reviews. Then, I might have noticed that this is a comic book. Forget the label ""graphic novel"". They only use that label to get the price up over $13. The plot is bare and predictable. The art is adequate comic book art. The story is poorly constructed and the characters lack the depth needed to keep my interest. If this was written to entice teenagers to develop an interest in the genre, then it might have some value; it had none for me. I was starting to really enjoy Martin's work, but between this and his wimpish political mutterings, I've just about given up on him. I'll spend my money on Jordan and Goodkind and leave this behind."
5,The rare perfect adaptation,"There are few adaptations that are absolutely true to their source material. This is definitely the exception as opposed to the rule.The stunning artwork is a perfect compliment to George R.R. Martin's already exquisite short story. It seems as though nothing is left out and the graphic novel medium seems a perfect fit for the story.This title is equally accessible to first time reader's of Dunk's exploits as it is to those who have already read and loved the story.The second edition, however, offers little in terms of new content. Some additional pieces of artwork at the end of the book and new cover art are all that is really offered. If, however, you are new to The Hedge Knight in the graphic novel format, this is defintely the edition to go with."
5,The Hedge Knight,"the Hedge Knight is not a traditional novel. It is instead a graphic novel written in the comic book style. If you enjoy the G.R.R. Martin novels, this story is a must have. Its set about 90 years before the books and provides a great back story to some of the people and places that appear later in the books. The illustrations also serve to bring the world of Westeros to vivid life and the last part displays the sigil's of each House. The Hedge Knoght is a quick read but a good one."
3,Good but should be updated,"This book had some useful information in it, although much of the material is 20 years old and I'm sure that we have better nutritional information now than then. For instance, Pritikin eliminates all oils including olive oil, and yet there is other literature that pushes the health benefits of olive oil."
4,"the definitive book about nutrition, way ahead of his time","Nathan was so far ahead of his time, people actually scoffed at his ideas about the link between nutrition and heart disease. Now we know much more than he did, but this basic overview makes more sense than any other book I have read on the subject."
5,Good Size for Mid-size packing,"at 9.5"" this is great for backpacking. EXTREMELY durable and resistant to flexing. Snap together and are easy to clean. The only downside is when removing the spork from the spa-knifey thing, the serrated edge may catch you and its SHARP. The Microbite is only 6"" overall if your looking for something shorter. I have both since they're cheap and AWESOME! I put a picture up of the contrast of the two."
4,interesting study of Carlyle,"Mellor provides a unified lens through which to view the most prominent of the British Romantic poets. She looks at many of their poems, and dissects them, sometimes against the political and cultural themes of the time.Of the poets, perhaps the most interesting in her account is Carlyle. He is possibly remembered today more as a historian than a poet, with his seminal French Revolution text, written while those events were still in living memory. Against his political ideals and philosophy, Mellor puts his poems. Useful, for they also are shown to imbue his beliefs, albeit maybe not as clearly as his historical writings."
5,Heartwarming,"My 2-year-old daughter just got this book and adores it. So do I. It's a terrific, feel-good book to read anytime, but especially at bedtime. Destined to be a classic."
2,boring!!,i found this book to be a tad too simplistic and boring to read to my infant. the bright primary colors are good to look at but i can't believe that i paid $11.95 for such a dull book. there are plenty of other great books out there!
1,Come ON...National Geograpic!! this is a stinker,"This video leads you to believe that it is about lions, when, in fact there is a bunch filler about frogs and bugs etc. If you have been to africa, you know that this is a sorry representation the lives of lions. It is about a pride of lions in decline. There is so little lion footage, they have resorted to filler stuff that is not related to lions. Further, the reproduction quality of the tape is poor. Kiley is wonderful, as usual, but they give him very little to work with. This might appeal to a fifth grader but is clearly not up to N.Geographics standards. AVOID!"
3,Good watch,"This is a good movie if you want to learn the basics about Lions. If you need specific behaviors about them, buy something else. I watched this for an Animal Behavior class and I needed to do alot of extra research to find specifics. Overall a good movie!"
2,NOT C6,"The description says it's C6 which I've been using and LOVE, but what I received was c8 . As others have reviewed this apparently is taking the place of C6??? But why advertise that it's C6 when it's not. I'm keeping it, because I LOVE Kinerase. But the C6 was great for fading age spots, and clearing my skin. I just hope this "" new"" stuff works well. Will update again after I use for a while. They did include two free samples for firm cream, which was reason I gave 2 stars. If this cream works as good or better I'll re review."
2,cute but not comfy,"Cute slippers, seemed comfy at first, but has such a high instep that your feet start to pull down on the sides, put extra stress on your feet and ankles so are not comfortable at all, could do without the instep. Would not purchase again"
2,Tommy Hilfiger slippers,"Although the size in length was fine, they were VERY wide and no where on the advertisement did they say they were for wide feet. So we haven't had too much wear out of them at all.However the shipping time was great."
3,Really wide,"I guess the slippers are ok for the price. They are a corduroy material with a satin feeling boarder. They are comfortable enough, but they are so wide I can't walk in them. I had narrow feet when I was young, but now at nearly 60 with server arthritis, I can't ware closed shoes and usually buy my slippers a little wider or a size larger. So I think if these are wide for me, they are going to be wide for a lot of others too. The bottom is not over stuffed like some slippers I see today, but padded enough to be comfortable walking outside. So If you like a really wide slipper, I think these would be good for the price. Otherwise, I'd say these are not for you."
4,good little book,i bought this book on amazon last year when i got my 1980 buffalo. like the title says it give you an overview of converted coaches with good anecdotal information and photos. i would buy it again. i didnt give it five stars because it could have used a few more photos but other than that its definately worth the money.
4,Great Conpanion For Microsoft Train Simulator,"This product works extremely well with microsoft train simulator and all of its add-ons. The only problem is there are a lot more buttons on the Cab Controller then on the screen of the cab on the screen of the train simulator. But, after about a half hour of trial and error, I figured out what I needed to know to drive a train. Don't be thrown of by the price, this is a great product. It also makes a great gift."
2,Bill - Seattle,I am disappointed that the dust collection system that is a big deal according to Dewalt will not fit on the sander if it is on the frame. This was not disclosed by Dewalt in anything I reviewed before I purchased it. This is just bad engineering. The instructions with the frame acknowledge the fact and tell you to turn off the dust collection lever when it is on the frame. So they knew of the problem. Why didn't they just design the frame to work with the dust collection system?
3,"Had issues, but with some effort it works well.","I received this product and all appeared well. I proceeded to mount this to my bench and found two issues :- Like an earlier review, the non-stick plastic piece on the sanding frame became unglued. I didn't pull on it or anything, it was just not glued on well. Luckily I didn't lose the mounting nuts, and was able to glue it back on better.- The adjustable fence would not stay secure in one position. It didn't take much pressure at all for it to move. With the addition of an extra washer on each side where you tighten the fence down, it now stays put.While I had these two issues, I would say overall I am happy with it now. I would have rated it higher if it had worked well right out of the box. I don't think 15 minutes of work on it is too much, however it shouldn't have needed it."
2,Defective,I open the box and started putting it together. The yellow plastic cover fell off. It appears there was glue but it did't hold.
4,Can't beat the price,As advertised. The phenolic base was coming unglued from the tool so I re-glued it and it's fine now.
3,"Works well as a frame, but had to fix already.","This works well at keeping the belt sander square to the surface. However, the non-stick plate became unglued from the metal and I had to reglue it, and find some replacement nuts that fell out of the frame whent the plate fell off."
4,Handy,This is a handy way to take a bench belt sander to a job site. It can be broken down and takes up very little space. Much less space than a sanding machine. You get your belt sander and a bench sander for minimal investment. The rest could use a better way to align it to 90 deg. and 45 deg. however.
3,Well made--except,"The structure is well constructed and the tolerances are well maintained, however, the glue securing the structure to the plastic sliding base is insufficient in quantity, application and strength. Crazy glue does the job but make sure the nuts are appropriately placed in their slots before clamping the two parts of the base."
4,"It's a nice story, a nice story","Abe ""Rabbi"" Liberman is a sixty year old Chicago PD Detective with bad knees. His partner Bill ""Father Murphy"" Halloran is a lapsed catholic, separated from his wife, and too familiar with the bottle. When one of their long-time informants asks them for protection, they agree... then she's murdered. Abe and Bill need to find her killer.Everything in this book is linear. The story moves ahead at a decent pace, and the clues are easy to find. No one in this book is a genius or a crime fighting avenger. Everyone just does their job.The weakness of the book is the characters. And there are many of them.. maybe too many. No one becomes a person because there just isn't enough time. But this is a series by a very fine writer and hopefully, everything will work out, and flesh out as the series unfolds."
3,Drat That Publisher,"This book was one of my favorites as a child, so I purchased a copy to give my four year old niece for Christmas. I couldn't believe they changed the best part of the story, and replaced it with ""Bother That Cat""I had my original copy for years, and read it often when I worked as a nanny or in daycare. The children always loved shouting ""Drat That Cat!"" at Mog's antics.Disappointed."
3,Terribly Disappointed,"I loved this book as a child and was pleased to find the Anniversary Edition in print. As I read the book to my daughter I couldn't believe that they changed the best part of the book. Instead of ""Drat That Cat"", it has been changed to ""Bother That Cat"".Some things should never be changed.I don't think I would have bought the book had I known the words were different."
1,Changed from Original Print,"I bought this book for my children as it was my favorite one as a child. Too bad the publisher has changed some words for political correctness. Buy the vintage version, not a new copy. Most disappointing."
5,love that mog!,I had the Mog book when I was young and lost it when I finally had children of my own. I have been trying to find the book until I found the 30th anniversary edition on Amazon. I am so excited to get my new Mog and share the happy memeoires with my children! I recommed this book with all my heart! It truly is a keepsake!
5,One of the best in the series,"This second book of the Birdwatcher's Mystery Series features Lark Drummond, the owner of a luxury hotel near Rocky Mountain National Park.Lark has become a partner, along with her friend Esther, in a business which imports organically-grown coffee from Mexico. When Esther is murdered, Lark becomes more closely involved in the business and in the investigation into Esther's death. This series always involves more than a mystery, and in this book the reader learns about organic coffee production and the Red-faced Warbler. This is the 4th. book in this series that I have read and so far it's my favorite one."
4,I LOVE this CD!,"I just got this CD and it's great. I really love bajo el arcoiris, bailando sola, muevelo, subidon, and popocatepetl. I try to sing along with the songs but it's hard for me to read the lyrics in spanish but still, this is a great CD just to listen and dance to. I really love it."
3,"good, not as good as the first one though","I love the first album whose beat is so energizing! this is worth a 3.5 star, it's not as quick as the first one. Plus the melody isn't that recognizable."
4,Good but not a tutorial,"Actually, probably everything you'd need for a tutorial is in here; it just isn't put in one place up front. Therefor, for someone totally unfamiliar with Snort, the sudden jump from installation to cook-book recipes may be confusing and unsettling.As there is plenty of material at http://www.snort.org/docs/ and as getting Snort running isn't all that complicated anyway, that's not a major flaw.Like another reviewer here, I think the rules sections are probably the best part of the book, though I was also impressed by the attention given to the specifics of Windows and Mac OS X - it's nice to see that level of completeness."
1,A disappointing fabrication,"The author must have gone to great length to ignore current evolutionary theory and come up this book. Its typical straw man arguments, intentionally misleading, miss the point. His diatribe on chirality speaks volumes on the authors ability to mislead and ignore. Don't believe me. Use a web search engine and search for ""chirality and evolution"" this will give you a good idea of just how pale his arguments are. I must admit I only read the first half of the book; however, by then I was just disgusted with his blatant dishonesty and gave it up. He has another agenda and he does us all a great disservice by serving this up as an honest work. I would have given it no star if that was available."
5,excellent,This is the perfect cookbook for people like myself who are not gourmet cooks. Being a New Yorker I am accustomed to eating out or having foods from many nations delivered to my door. Now in my new home in Maine delivery is NOT an option. I have used the GOOD FOOD BOOK for many years in NY. Rather than taking it back and forth I decided owning another copy would make more sense. Try the chili without meat. It's my favorite.
5,I lost all my pregnancy weight with this book!,"A friend who had lost and maintained her weight loss with this book recommended it to me after the birth of my daughter, when I couldn't lose the considerable weight I had gained. I started cooking exclusively out of this book (a different recipe every night) and the weight melted off! This is quite a feat, as my first child was born when I was 41. I DID have to buy a food processor, though, as some of my favorite recipes took forever to put together without it. WITH it, a snap. And BEST OF ALL - the recipes are delicious! My husband loves them, my children love (most of) them. Ms. Brody does not shun salt, fat or meat, but she does limit them. We continue to cook regularly out of this book - it is falling apart."
2,High carbohydrate diets are not for everyone,"This cookbook came out in 1985 at a time when meats and fats were being cited as unhealthy aspects of diet. Brody's recipes correspond to the now controversial food pyramid that encourages the eating of lots of starchy foods, especially if they are ""whole grain."" Many people will gain weight on such a diet, and have returned to making meat and vegetables the centerpiece of meals. For those who don't gain on high carb, Brody's recipes are well-tested and tasty."
5,My cook book staple - have yet to try a recipe I didn't like,Jane brings basic nutrition education and cooking together in a great book. Love all the comments by the reviewer and have yet to try a recipe I didn't like. A substantial cookbook that I use as a cooking basic. Love the book--this is my second copy since the first is so war torn.
3,Liked the smaller model better,"It really needs more suction if it's going to be this much bigger than the little 1/2 gallon vacuum. Maybe I'm just spoiled by my big shop vac. Quality and fit are great and if your battery dies, you can also plug it in and use it. I returned it and just got the small DC515 vac which is the little 1/2 gallon model. Nice and small with as much suction as this one. Sort of like a heavy duty dust-buster. Also, the 1/2 gallon vac comes with one battery. The smaller vac has the removable hose also...but it is loud."
4,Very good but not perfect,Good points:Battery and cordWell builtPowerful for sizeCompactEasy to empty and cleanBad points:Narrow hose clogs with large itemsLimited battery lifeOverall I would recommend.HandymanNYC
3,"Not great, not bad","This vac is small enough to be tossed in the tool box or left in my truck, and has a capacity high enough to justify it's existence, (unlike the other dewalt mini vac). However, it sounds like a jet taking off when it's running (it is as loud / louder as my full size vac), and the power leaves a little something to be desired. Don't expect to pick up much."
3,"Overall good, could use more power","This is NOT a full-blown shop vac. If you're looking for that kind of power, you're going to be disappointed. It has more power than other portable vacs, much more than a dustbuster type vac.For light vacuuming around the shop or for portable use, like in the car, this vacuum works well. I like the fact that you can plug it in when you have a job that would take too long for the batteries to last. Overall, it's a good portable vacuum, although it's a little expensive for what it is."
3,A Little Larger And Less Well-Designed Than I Expected,"I haven't used the vacuum much, but it seems to have pretty good suction. I was a little disappointed in the design for storage of the cord and the accessory vacuum ends. The design is little more than a clumsy full-sized shop vac."
4,Nice vac,"Nice, functional vacuum. Works as advertised. Originally came with parts missing, return was effortless, replacement came swiftly. Quite decent suction, battery almost lasts long enough to vacuum out a vehicle."
5,Great Vaccum,I Just Got one a few weeks ago and love it. I use my 14.4 battery from my drill and it last about 10 min . I have three boy's and use it on a daily bases at least once a day but usually more then that. Like one time the kid over ran the sink and I used it to clean up the water that was every were. If you have kids it is a must for them small mishaps. I am amazed at the suction it works great and I Love it!
1,If this was my first DeWalt tool I would never buy another!,"I own many DeWalt cordless tools and am very happy with all. BUT this vacuum couldn't pick up anything but drywall dust, and very little of that. When I got it out of the box I was very pleased with the quality of the appearance and the accessories, but then I tried to use it. What a disappointment. The attachments won't stay on the hose, and the vacuum power is so low my 20 year old Black & Decker with a clogged filter has 5 times the sucking power. The DW execs should be embarrassed to offer this next to their other tools. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's not even worth the cost of shipping to try it and return it to Amazon."
2,Dewalt Vac,"Just a short note I purchased one used for cleaning cars floormats for the family after the cars were washed. I have numerous Dewalt Products 18 volts over 20 different tools so I am very famaliar with correct use. Vac has average suction not real great. My only major complaint as I bought item NEW not a rebuild vac was that the vac lasted for a little over 18 months then quit functioning. Vac was never used for anything more than vaccumming small particles of dirt, lint and sand from vehicle floormats as I have two large shop vacs for other applications. The life of this tool is completely different and was extremely short compared to many other Dewalt tools I have. I replaced the first vac and purchased another New Dewalt vac and the same thing happened again only this vac lasted for a little less than one year. Took to Dewalt repair shop and the repair estimate was close to the cost of a replacement New vac."
2,Underpowered,"We purchased this to vacuum ash from around our wood stove. We did not expect it to pick up much else because of its size. If any of the attachements are used, the suction is diffused to the point of non-existance. Even without any attachments, the suction leaves a lot to be desired. The DeWalt leaves what the Hoover picks up without effort. We have used this only when plugged in. We did not yet test with the battery even though we are a DeWalt house so have a lot of 18v charged and available.We are going to invoke the 30 day satisfaction guaranty and return the vacuum. Its dissapointing since we are so happy with our other DeWalt tools."
5,Portable and Powerful,"I bought the DeWault brand because a friend of mine had a similar vacuum but I did not want to pay additional money for the batteries. Thankfully, my dad already had many DeWault tools, so I searched for a DeWault cordless shop vac. He loved the gift, and it had proven very useful for small jobs around the house such as the fireplace, pet food, and the cars. It comes with a cord so the battery doesn't always have to be used. It also comes with a few hose attachments as a regular shop vac would. The suction power isn't fantastic, but, hey, it's a battery, and I'm not sucking up bricks. Overall, a nice roomy and handy portable shop vac that is a great addition to any DeWault collection."
2,"Dry vac good, wet vac terrible!","I have had mine for about 4 years. I'm only giving it 2 stars because it does not work like described. It is suppose to be a wet/dry vac. The problem is pretty simple. As soon as the filter gets wet, there is no more suction! Most wet dry vacs tell you to remove the paper filter for wet usage. Dewalt stats in the instructions NOT to remove the filter. If you web search this problem, you will find many results."
2,Too bad this vac doesn't suck...,"The suction is miserable on this vacuum. The build quality is typical DeWalt and the battery option is nice, but for $100 it should suck more. Really."
2,not worth the money,The unit does not have much power and the cord is too short. Not worth the money! Could have purchased a small unit with more power @ less cost. Would not buy again.
4,a must have,"love the cord or cordless feature. pretty good power for light to medium duty vac & blower work, Glad I got it."
5,Not a Shop Vac..,"What the DEWALT DC500 2-Gallon 12-18-Volt Cordless/Corded Wet/Dry Vacuum is, is a small and easily portable but very hungry little vacuum cleaner. It has a cord and plugs into 120 volt AC, or; it's cordless and operates on 12-18 volt DEWALT batteries. When used with the cord or cordless, it still has the same efficiency. This vacuum has enough suction to clean up some heavy duty jobs but its light enough to carry anywhere you need it. There are enough attachments to accomplish most jobs around the house or shop and it even cleans up water. This vacuum is great for the occasional or professional handyman. It's a little noisy but works very well at cleaning up most waste and spills.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
4,Great but needs accessories,"I've owned one of these for a couple of years and like it. However...... it would be nice if there was a built-in charger (I realize that might be a problem) and, being as powerful as it is, some available extensions to allow floor use without bending over or easier access to overhead and deep spaces. As it stands, I don't recognize the size for hard plastic extensions although this might be resolved with a trip to Woodcraft or somewhere similar."
3,Falls Short,"This Vac has a cord and runs on batterys, How much more would it cost to make it charge the battery? For me the whole idea is to carry less stuff around."
2,False Advertising,"Just received. Have not used yet, so I can't comment on how well it runs. However, it does NOT use ""all"" Dewalt batteries. Specifically, it uses only the pod style batteries, not the Max series. So, if you have the Max series, like I have, you're up the creek."
2,Small jobs only.,"Yes it sucks more air than other battery powered vacuums but: in brief it is rather heavy and has very short battery life and no extension handle accessory. Even using the 18v so called long lasting $90 battery, it quits only after about 1,500 sq. ft of dusty floor space, about 15 minutes of use. Dewalt customer service said that it would pickup multiple bags of cement but it will NOT in my experience hardly do much dust off the floor. I spent $240 on the vacuum, charger, and best battery and feel this is too much for the results I got. The unit is light until the battery is put in then it is really heavy (I'm a 250lb man and think so). The body is wide bulky but should be narrow in format and longer since it bumps everything and bumps you in the side which is part of why it seems heavy."
1,No Battery included and does Not charge batteries,There are no batteries included and when you plug it in it doesn't charge the a battery you need to buy to run it.If you don't mind buying a charger and battery and removing the battery from the vacume to charge it every 10 min of use then its OK and you have alot of extra money and free time.
3,Good portable for medium size jobs,Works fine for medium jobs. Battery last about 45 minutes of run time.One thing I did not expect was the weight of the hose. Its wire coil support is made of very large diameter wire making hose quite heavy.
3,"Portable, but not very powerful",I'm a fan of my DeWalt tools. I like being able to share the batteries in several tools. So this vac seemed like a good choice.I found it not very powerful. It is very easy to move about the house and handle minor messes.
5,DeWalt DC500 Vacuum,"I bought this vacuum to use on my screened in pool area and it works great. I hated dragging out my old shopvac that needed to be plugged in and trying to keep the plug from going in the pool. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a shoulder strap, battery, or a charger but If you do need to buy a battery I would suggest buying an off brand. I bought two off brand batteries for the same price as one DeWalt battery and they work awesome. This vacuum meets all my needs and worth the money."
4,"good enough vaccum for small clean up, perfect for me","i bougth this vaccumm for small indoor little jobs, i found it good enough for small amount of mess, suction is good eigther corded or cordless, more than i was expecting acording to another reviews i read before i purchased mine, so, so far so good, since i already have 18v cordless combo kit and batteries, so if somebody is thinking on adding this one with a similar purpose and situation i will recomended,it worth it."
3,Only buy it if you truly need to go cordless,"I was not a current Dewalt user and should have been more careful. The cost of the batteries and charger which are not included didn't make it worth my while. If you need to be away from traditional power sources it's worth the investment, but the cost of the batteries could buy a lot of extenstion cord. If you own the batteries already, it might make a nice addition to your home or garage. I'm returning it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this based on its claim that it worked on 12 to 18 volt batteries.I have a bunch of 14.4 tools that all work fine. When I inserted a fully charged 14.4 battery it ran so slow that I thought it wasn't running at all!Tried another fully charged battery and the same thing. I did plug it in and it worked fine that way but that's not what I wanted. We have several plug in vacs already. I returned it the next day for full refund, which is a big reason to use Amazon in the first place - no hassel returns!***12/10/2010 This is not the vacuum I reviewed! I reviewed the DC 500***"
1,Weak!,"I needed a powerful cordless wet/dry vac so I did a lot of research, ended up trusting the Amazon reviews for this product, and finally bought it from Amazon. I was really disappointed when I unpacked it and tried it: it was extremely weak, whether plugged in or on battery power. Luckily, Amazon accepted it as defective, and refunded me my total purchase price. That's why I but a lot of stuff from Amazon, they're fair and honest with returns. I'd be afraid to buy another one, and find out that the weak performance is due to poor design and a weak motor."
1,Very dissapointed with DeWalt.,"I purchased this vacuum on Jan 12, 2007. The next day I tried to use it around the garage, It was very hard to use since due to my aching back, it did not have an extension. I did not feel like cleaning with my back bent (not good). Also, when I did plug the unit, the suction was the worst I've seen, I thought because it was made by DeWalt, it would be very strong as the readers suggested. I returned the unit the next day for a full refund. Now, I will be buying a Shopvac ( model 587-25-00) from Amazon."
2,"Grossly underpowered, Overpriced with short attachment arm.","I purchased it to get rid of cobwebs and dust from high corners. The cleaning attachment arm is pretty short and the suction is comparable to regular house hold vacuum cleaner. Have not tried the wet feature. Overall very mediocre machine but when factor in the price, this is very sub standard product. NOT WORTH IT!!!"
3,Works OK but not great.,"Seems well built, I love having the battery and pug in option. The vacuum is very handy, but really lacks in power and effectiveness. I think I would either try the new smaller unit for battery use or buy a better portable plug in unit."
4,totally worth it,"Honestly? I bought this movie because Amy Sedaris is in it for about five seconds. Turns out that Judah Friedlander is a decent actor outside of 30 Rock. If I remember right, this movie isn't very expensive and is a fun indie comedy. Nothing very inappropriate in it and definitely worth seeing."
3,Never Grow Up,"A fairly enjoyable romp through scenic Florida parallels one man's journey to discover just how twisted his childhood really was.The film managed to hook me visually with some creative and colorful shots, and while the plot had its awkward moments, overall it managed to convey its ultimate purpose with relative ease. While the protagonist of the picture tended to grate at times (and it was probably just me anyway), the colorful cast of strange folk he meets along the way kept things fresh."
1,"Annoying characters, dumb plot","The male lead here makes me want to slap him, he is so annoying. Not only his dumb haircut, but the attempts to be 'childlike' are just annoying. He can't grow up? Is that supposed to be a good thing? They shot this low budget indie mostly in south Florida and along Alligator Alley. I know because I live there. However, they get the geography wrong and this will turn off Florida viewers. They are on the way to ""Diggetyland."" But somehow they go by way of Tarpon Springs, which is 400 miles north on the west coast. They also visit Weeki Wachi, which is nearby. But anyone going to Disney knows you don't go that direction from Miami. Duh.... This thing is short at least. Debbie Harry (Blondie) has a short role."
1,Case was broken,The CD was shipped with a broken plastic case! I won't buy any more CD's from Amazon. This is the third time that I have had a bad CD experience from Amazon.
3,An entertaining read,"A good superficial read on the historical development of 12 tone equal temperament. For a more in-depth and analytical look at temperament I would recommend Harry Partch's Genesis of a Music.A word of warning, this book is available under 2 titles. Temperament - the idea that solved music's greatest riddle, and Temperament - how music became a battleground for the great minds of western civilization. I purchased both assuming that they were companion works, but they are identical."
2,Could have used a lot more math,"This book does an adequate job of explaining the troubles inherent in musical tuning to a layperson. However, why does a book about frequencies and the relationships between them avoid the word ""hertz""? I would have appreciated knowing HOW far off a modern keyboard's fifth is from a true one, and how big Pythagoras' comma really is. The author seems to be avoiding this kind of exposition in favor of fractions and many, many adjectives, which didn't work for me. At the same time, some concepts pop up in the book unexplained (a fourth is mentioned in passing for the first time on page 143, after we've been dragged through the ratios of octaves, fifths and thirds several times). The book seems to be aimed at people who already know some music theory but can't tolerate math, an audience that probably doesn't exist.While the accompanying history tried hard to entertain, there were too many diversions away from the main topic. Less flavor, please, and more numbers."
3,Not quite what I was looking for.,"This book contains some very good and entertaining history, but it doesn't have much physics and/or mathematics of the 12 tone scale and/or its precedents. If you are interested in the history of the development of the various scales however, I think you will find it very interesting. I was looking for something a little more technical in nature. for technical discussions of the subject, I recommend, ""On the Sensation of Tone"" by Hermann Helmholtz."
2,EXCELLENT GOAL; FAILED EXECUTION,"I was caught up in the early chapters, but when the author lost his focus it was total disappointment. The book became a laundry list of names and theories; many unrelated to the subject at hand. As a teacher I liken this to many of the Master's theses to which I was subjected."
3,"Interesting subject, unsatisfactory treatment","The book is too anecdotal, an amateurish cultural history. Many of the materials are not quite relevant. If the author stuck to the subject the pages could be two-third less. Hope someone will come up with a better one."
1,Pretentious and uninformative,"The theme of this book, the history behind modern tuning and its effect on the development of modern music and modern keyboard instruments, is a fascinating one. Sadly, Mr. Isacoff is more interested in letting us know that he's acquainted with celebrities, practices eastern meditation and is acquainted with books on a range of topics (e.g., medieval and renaissance Judaism and mathematics), than he is in coherently rendering his theme. This is the worst sort of non-academic history, an author who's unable to keep the story on track and is more interested in proving that he's interesting than in providing anything of value to the reader."
1,Very disappointing,"Like several others, I bought this book after reading a laudatory review in the Economist. I was very, very disappointed with the book. As a relatively new piano player, I had hoped to learn two things from the book -- (1) how pianos are tuned and why; and (2) some historical background on the development of the piano. The book delivers on neither. As several commentators have pointed out, the science of piano tuning is completely - and maddeningly -- ignored. To be sure, the author throws some fractions around in the book, but it is just about impossible for anyone but a professional piano tuner to make sense of the details. Finally, as a general introduction to the history of the piano, the work is a bust. Certainly, there are some interesting tidbits, but the organization is so poor, the argument so meandering, that it is hard to keep one's attention focused. I have to wonder: Are those laudatory reviews all from the author's friends?"
2,Reconsideration,"I just couldn't resist buying this book and also sending a copy to one of my colleagues. I am in the process of carefully reading it and will comment when finished. Much of the early historical information is good reading, well researched and well well written. However, I do find common misconceptions and frankly, errors. I believe it is important, however to read the views of others, whether one agrees with them or not. Sometimes it results in a change of opinion, sometimes a compromise in one's thinking and sometimes a strengthening of one's original position. I do recommend buying this book and reading it but taking its premise with a grain of salt. If you'd like to read what I have written on this subject, independently of this author, please see the short message about who I am."
3,Beware Kindle,"Well written and thoroughly researched, this is a typical McCullough fascinating and informative narrative. Why the 3 stars: because the KINDLE edition is not complete. No illustrations, some of which are referred to in the text (as in ""Following is an illustration of ...""). A ""List of Illustrations"" is in the Table of Contents but alas without a link to the text or an appendix or anywhere in the book. Buyer Beware."
4,Awash With Tragedy,"This is a fascinating account of the most devastating inland flood in American history. Thousands of people drowned when Johnstown, PA was wiped out in seconds by a wall of water and debris that was unleashed when a dam belonging to an elite hunting and fishing club failed. In addition to being a rivetting account of the flood and its aftermath, including stories from numerous survivors who witnessed horrifying things on that cold rainy day in 1889, the tale of the dam and how it got to be so dangerous is fascinating as well. It amounts to the usual story of rich white men refusing to shell out the money to keep the dam in good condition, and completely ignoring the concerns of the mayor of Johnstown below, with devastating consequences. Truly, a tragedy and a scandal for the ages."
2,I can find almost every topic interesting - but not this one - too many details,I was anxious to read this book as it seems similar to Isaac's Storm. But it was a struggle to read because of all the details about what town is where and how far/how deep/when/why and too many people just made it a confusing bore.Rarely do I not finish a book but I got about 1/3 of the way into this (by pushing myself) and finally I just put it down as it was too much like studying for a test.I did not find it relaxing but annoying to try to keep myriad facts and figures and people straight instead of just enjoying a good book. THUMBS WAY DOWN. Maybe somebody like an engineer would enjoy it but that's just a guess.
2,"Interesting story, but could have been told in half the number of pages","Interesting story, but could have been told in half the number of pages. I wanted to learn about the flood, and there was a lot of interesting information not only about the flood itself but about the people involved. But it needs a harsh editor. Or perhaps it should be a chapter rather than a book."
5,Engrossing Piece of Social History,"With a remarkable economy of descriptive language, McCullough chronicles the horrors of the natural and social disaster of the 1889 Johnstown flood. American innovation and rapid industrialization had generated an increasingly complex economy with its benefits and woes. Much of this story is about realization of the new phenomena of society's mega-rich and their interactions with the rest of society. This story is a graphic description of how weather, extreme wealth, industry, rapid social and human nature can be combined to yield all sorts of effects. It is by no means a must read but a remarkably bright piece of social history that exercises the imagination and diffuses many of history's more detailed lessons."
5,Another great McCullough,David McCullough has done another wonderful job telling the story of the Johnstown Flood. He brings everythihg he writes about to life as if you were there and can take part in the events yourself. I now have all of his books and re-read them with joy. Can't wait for the next one.
4,An Avoidable Tragedy,"In 1889, Johnstown, PA was a thriving community of steel mills manned by hard working blue collar families. In the hills above, a group of wealthy industrial magnates, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Mellon among them, had built an exclusive summer resort. It was the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club erected on a lake formed by an earthen mound dam, 72 feet high. After a very wet spring, great storms raced through the mountains with flood waters which filled the lake to overflowing. On May 31, the dam burst and a deluge of water over 70 feet high roared down the steep valleys and gorges, through several small villages to the city and beyond."
5,Riveting,"David Mccullough's style is conversational and he does a great job of building suspense throughout the tale. The length is very appropriate to the subject. If you enjoy Erik Larson, especially ""Isaac's Storm"", you will enjoy this book. If like me, you have spent a few years living in Pittsburgh you will be able to place many of the club members names in the form of university buildings and museums etc."
3,Not McCullough's Best,"Having read several of McCullough's other books, I was disappointed as I read The Johnstown Flood. This book seemed slow-moving (unlike the flood itself) and I had trouble maintaining any level of interest. Compared to The Great Bridge, I felt this book was a bit of a dud."
3,In the Minority on This One.,"Since a generation of my mother's family lived in Johnstown I was eager to read this book, especially as it was written by such a famous author. While the story is riveting and well-researched, I found the poor editing a major distraction. Come on, Simon and Schuster, such a distinguished and renowned author deserves better."
4,Pennsylvania 1889 --They're Gonna Wash Us Away,"The scope of the devastation visited on the modest city of Johnstown, PA by the 1889 flood rivaled what happened to the entire Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina, except with almost no warning and with a much greater man-made component. McCullough does his usual scrupulous job of researching history and telling the story. As with the 1927 flood of the Mississippi and 2005's Hurricane Katrina, much of the tragedy stemmed from people's reluctance to deal with the power and relentless of natural law."
3,Catastrophes are Always Imminent,"A well-written exploration of a tragic failure that reflects on our own times. We've come a long way in our over-sight of large construction projects, but we still fail to prepare for worst case scenarios. We have a lot to learn from this story."
2,I expected more from David McCullough,I was disappointed in this book. i've read other works of David McCullough and expected much more. Much of the book was a list of names of deceased.
1,Not up to McCullough expectations,"Having read several of David McCulloughs books, Adams and Truman, I was very disappointed in this one. It could be the subject matter, more so than the writing, but it was boring."
3,good but not great,"I found ""Johnstown Flood"" to be about 2/3 uninteresting. The book begins with a long build-up about the history of the area and the decades-long issues with the South Fork Dam. Some local characters are introduced. The most dynamic part of the book of course is the account of the flood itself and that part is excellent. The account of the initial days after the flood are also well-done. The book then bogs down with reporting about all the failed litigation that arose afterwards. I got somewhat lost in all the facts that McCullough includes. The book I would most compare it to is Walter Lord's account of the TITANIC, ""A Night to Remember."" Lord's book is far more interesting as he brings to life a number of sub-stories. Lord of course benefited from being able to interview a number of TITANIC survivors while McCullough had to rely solely on the news reporting of the time (shockingly misleading and full of hyperbole) and some memoirs written by survivors."
3,Not up to David McCullough's standards,A bit long and drawn out. It was an interesting book but some of the characters dropped into and out of the story that they were difficult to follow.
4,Better than fiction,I was watching a show one time where a boy was asked to explain why he liked his grandfather's stories so much. He said he liked them because they were not only interesting but true. This book by David McCullough is just one example of why this boy made such a profound statement. The Johnstown Flood is one of the worst natural disasters in US history and what makes it all the better is that McCullough tells it like it is a story and not a boring history event. He seems to do this in all his books and this is why he is one of my favorite historical writers along with Steven Ambrose. McCullough not only gives the background of this horrid event but describes the event in such vivid detail that you feel like you must have been there. It isn't really a difficult book to read so if you have a teenager give this book to him/her to get a sense of real history. This is a great story that can be used to get better aquainted with the lesser told stories in the history of the United States.
5,"Spendid, moving, tragic history","The Johnstown flood symbolizes the sweeping hand of an elite, distant class of people with little regard for those ""beneath them"". To create a sense of country life in the Pennsylvania mountains, a few very wealthy people played with Mother Nature, building a cheap damn to form a lovely lake. But the lake proved to be more powerful than the dam, and tragedy poured out. Country lifestyles of the rich and famous came tumbling down a narrow gorge, nearly wiped Johnstown off the map, and forever changed the way Americans looked at dams.Any school child or any adult who believes that history is boring or absent color simply needs to read this fine book, not only to enjoy a good story but also to learn how charmed lives, misplaced hope, ill-managed technology and simple human error can combine to make tragedy.If this were fiction, you'd marvel at how he made it up. But it's real, and all the more marvelous in the telling and in the detail."
5,Yet another superb McCullough history,"[For reasons that elude me, one-line reviews are unpublishable (having attempted them unsuccessfully many times, I say this with some authority), no matter their relevance. So, I will add another line to this review, and see what happens.] JF is vintage DM: popular history of the highest order, a gripping tale well told. Dive in!"
5,Excellent,Another exceptional book by this outstanding author. A real look at who was responsible for this historic tragedy. Loved it.
5,Very Informative,"Even though I live near Johnstown, I knew little about the flood and David McCullough filled in the gaps. Now I am considering visiting just to see how the town has changed."
4,As floods go...,"My husband is the history buff in our family & I bought this book as a Christmas stocking stuffer. I began reading it because, well, just because. I'm glad I did. David McCullough's writing put you on a floating roof and carried you down the Little Conemaugh. His development of many of the minor characters was astounding, considering the fact there was not much anecdotal history to go on. Extremely informative, the evidence and roles played around the re-building of the South Fork dam & the rapid growth of Johnstown was eye-opening. An exciting ride."
5,The Very Best True Story,"It is better than a mystery, a true story told like you were there by an expert of emotional feelings, David McCullough. Exceptional and David's first book."
5,love ad war john jakes,"I have always enjoyed this time period,and the way john jakes makes it com alive,the way he mixes fact and fiction makes his works enjoyable and a learning experience,second to none,I was happy to replace a missing book and look forward to the next purchase as i complete my john jakes collection,this will be past on to my children and grandchildren"
4,Good Read,"Good read. Expected great read from the reviews, but I didn't think it was as good as Gone With The Wind."
4,"Recommended for ""North and South"" fans!","This continuation of Jakes' ""North and South"" is well-done and an absorbing read. The book flings the reader into the Civil War, as seen from various vantage-points: Charles, in the Southern calvary; Billy, a Northern engineer; Orry and George, working desk jobs in their respective capitals; Madeline, Brett, and Constance, as ""war widows."" Bent continues to wreak havoc in the lives of the Mains and Hazards, but despite him, the war and other trying events, the 2 families remain in contact and even help each other during the war. An excellent follow-up to Jakes' wonderful ""North and South."""
4,Beautiful light romance,"Kay Hooper writes romance on a light-hearted and whimsical note. Her characters may have deep issues that they are dealing with but the overall tone is uplifting.On Wings of Magic has a heroine running from the things she has experienced while traveling the world with her father. She uses the classic helpless blonde stereotype to keep people at an emotional distance so she doesn't get hurt again. Hawke knows he wants Kendall for his own as soon as he sets eyes on her and immediately sets out to prove to her that her emotions are safe with him.In classic Hooper style there is a cat to provide some comic relief, romance that lets you know what's happening without going into details and lots of fun conversation between the lovers."
4,Struck my fancy--------goooood book,"Hawk is a man most women dream about................Romance, romance romance. Kay Hooper did it again, she captures your emotions in many ways."
3,a little too much,"a little too much romance for it to be even slightly realistic, but I read it and passed it on to my sister who LOVES that kind of story"
3,On Wings Of Magic,This book rocks my unicorn necklace world. I wish I could live on Hawke Island. It is a must read for everyone.
3,"""Not"" Heavy Duty","This clamp is probably fine for mounting a cowbell or jam block, but I bought it to mount a set of Meinl Mini-Timbales to a cymbal stand. It is not nearly as heavy duty as other similar pieces of Gibraltor hardware that I have purchased, but I wanted it to integrate with the Meinl Timbs. Actually, the ""selling"" feature of the length adjustment bolt in the center turns out to be it's main flaw because even when tightened to the utmost, there is still some wobble between the two connecting pieces. It's doing the job, but it's definitely not as sturdy as I would have liked."
2,wat to heavey,I just got this saw and was surprised how downright heavy it is. I have not used it long enough to see any other problem but you don't want to have to do vertical or over head job with this.+ when I got it and plugged it in the switch was locked in the on setting It made me fell like Captain Ron as it shot across the table on to the floor will return it
1,Get a real sander like porter cable,Had 3 of these....they where all problems. The first one lasted 2 weeks when the maib drive wheel broke. the next two broke to many belts....I used 3m belts and it didnt matter after 5 min the belt would break. I couldn't afford to keep replacing belts so after the 3rd unit I bought the portercable 352vs. I still have the same belt on it. The Dewalt feels solid and weighs a ton but is the worst tool I have ever owned.DW
1,It is toast!,"I am a woodworker and took a chance on DeWalt instead of Porter Cable. Not again. I have used this for only a few times, mainly because it sat unused for two months waiting for internal plastic replacement parts which broke. Yesterday, after only 15 minutes of medium use, it literally caught on fire and the motor burnt up. I am off to purchase a PC."
1,Worst tool I ever bought,I agree with the negative reviews: this thing never tracked properly. NEVER. Also I have struggled with it's dust collection 'system.'I do not recommend this sander.
1,Don't buy this sander,"I bought this sander about five years ago and right out of the box the tracking was terrible. I sent the sander in for repair and the repair note said that I had dropped it. Not even true. Even after it was fixed the tracking never worked. I have a $40 Black & Decker that works much better. Go with Porter Cable, Bosch, Harbor Freight - anybody but this Dewalt junk. Too many people have this same problem."
1,Not what I thought,The wall hangers work great. But the description says 12. You only get three. I ordered 8 packages thinking I was getting 96 wall hangers. I got 24. Not the deal I thought it would be. Very disappointed. Need to change the description to set of three instead of misleading people like that.
3,My cat didn't like it.,"I have no complaint about the product, except that my cat didn't like it. Some cats will, I'm sure. She is a very tiny, older cat and I was using it to re-moisten her canned food after she had licked all the gravy off of it, hoping she would eat more of the food. No luck. She wouldn't touch it."
4,Looks awesome! Beware of the size,"I just purchased this item and it looks amazing, but I couldn't do much with it since the Medium size I ordered was almost child size, so I am having to return it. I am not sure if the large size will work but I am afraid this may be a mislabeled child item."
4,Be careful with sizes!!!!!!!,"Product is great, very good quality however sizes are crazy.... my nephew uses a size S and that is what we ordered... helmet stopped at his forehead... ask for at least one bigger size, if you are S then buy a M or L. It is frustrating the time you spend returning the item and then having to order again..."
5,Great helmet for the kids,"My 3 and 5 year old both like biking, scootering and more. We had very good helmets already but not full face. Other parents recommended that we get a full face helmet. We shopped around and I bought two of these (different sizes) for the kids. It has saved them several times now. They tell me that visibility is very good and they do not get hot at all. I'd recommend these. The kids are excited to wear them and we are happy they are well protected."
4,To Small,"The helmet sizing is crazy, I have a small head and I figured a small would fit me just fine....""wrong"". The Small size didnt even fit down over my head, stoped at my forehead. Even if you think you have a small head PLEASE order a medium or a large. I posted this review because I dont want any other loyal MTB riders to make the same mistake. Other than that this is a very nice tuff built helmet. Take the Bell stickers off and throw on some Monster Energy logo's and it looks pritty sick."
2,BMX Bike Helmet,"Cool looking helmet, quality look and feel; however, the base where the screws that hold the visor is weak. Two screw became loosened within days of use. I tried to tighten, but the nut inside of the helmet kept turning and there is no way of holding it down."
5,Bubble wrap,"Great seller, FAST Shipment. Arrive on time, as described, and met our expectations for quality!!! Would definitely recommend this seller and buy from them again!!!"
1,Flat Overprice BubbleWrap,"This was the worst bulk order..yes I ordered 4 boxes...I am so disappointed! The bubble wrap is flat every other cell...in all 4 boxes. This is not the same product I have purchased in the past, even though I clicked on my purchases to order it. Completely different. BAD!!!!! Do Not Buy. The seller offered a refund of purchase price, but not for shipping...and wanted me to pay to ship them back. As we all know, the shipping back would have cost more than keeping the items, so I kept them , but will NEVER order this item again or from the seller. POOR RESPONSE!"
1,Design blunder,"Dewalt made a mistake in the design of this adapter in that the port has a diameter of 1 1/2 inches and therefore cannot be attached to a standard 1 1/4 inch vacuum hose. The package clearly states that this adapter does connect to a 1 1/4 inch hose. I contacted Dewalt but they have not responded. I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent me another one which is just as useless as the first. I tried using a 'universal adapter' and that would not fit it either. If Dewalt ever corrects the design, I will attempt to post the news here. Until then, don't buy this unless you can connect to a 1 1/2 inch (outside diameter) port."
3,vacuum adapter,"the fein vacuum hose I have fit like a glove, but the rubber clamp that holds the adapter to the belt sander came lose a couple of times during sanding. I would like to see DeWalt design a better clamp to hold the Vacuum adapter on with"
2,Works but silly design,Why they made an adapter that uses half of the bag dust collector is beyond me. Why not just make an adapter that fits the sander. The adapter does not seal well. It is very close to the bottom of the sanding plane so it tend to snag the work at times. And worst of all it is too big to be used with the sanding frame. Just stupid design. DeWalt blew it. Nice sander and poor dust management.
5,Works Great and the excellent price,Made a flagpole from PVC pipe for tailgating. Had to make some minor alterations to the flagpole holder. This was something I had messed up not the flagpole holder. Very happy with the flagpole holder and it looks like it will last for many years of tailgating. GO TIGERS!
5,Awesome Learner Guitar,This is an amazing price and product!!! I loved that everything you need to get a jump start on learning how to play is in one package! This is a all in one starter kit and you never even knew it until it arrived... I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn!!! Good Luck to all the new talent that picks this product.
3,"Good, not spectacular","Good size for my 6 or 8 year old. Actually RED (as others said). (We paid $35 and I think it's worth that.) guitar goes in gig bag neck first. Seems a little more lightweight than I would expect compared to our full sized guitars, but overall, it seems decent.(We're still overcoming the 'sore fingers' hurdle from learning to hold down strings...dramatic 6 year old. My 8 year old didn't complain any when he used it.)"
2,VERY cheap looking - Mine came with lots of chips and cracks on surface!,I ordered the PINK guitar as a christmas gift for my 5 year old...(she really wants to play guitar)when i received it and opened the box up it was very dark RED :((the surface of the guitar is VERY VERY cheap looking. there were multiple cracks and chips and some minor dents.I really should have gone to the local music store! I would NOT order this product again.VERY disappointed!
3,Guitar,"This guitar was a little cheaper looking than I anticipated, but I guess you get what you pay for. The color was also different than the color in the picture, it looked like a soft pink, but when it arrived it was more like a pepto bismo/orange pink around the edges.I think it will work good for our needs though."
1,Sorry - but not any good. . .,I was hoping this was going to be a great deal but it wasn't. Could never get it in tune and had to send it back. And then I messed up and sent it back without an Amazon ticket and still haven't received my refund - plus paying almost $15 to ship it back. I lost out on this one.
1,Don't overlook,"I think what most people aren't getting, is to really look at what experienced people have to say about this product. It doesn't hurt to spend a little extra money on a $60 guitar on amazon(sure, you get what you pay for, but a $60 guitar compared to a $30 guitar, can have a significant difference). This pink one doesn't look all that great from my perspective, and I just wouldn't trust not being able to hold it in my hands and seeing what other experienced people have to say about it. Apparently this company is not the safest to go with either. Reviews really do help!"
2,not good,i bought this for my daughter and it is basically just a toy first off there is a guitar string but not place on the guitar for it like real ones and there comes with a tuner but no instructions on how to tune it and there isn't a book not even a card with it.and the guitar still has wood inside and u can here it and the wood inside is not smooth at all u but ur finger and ur automatically going to get like 5 billion spliter
3,mediocre at best,The paint was smudged and clearly a repair job was attempted but was an epic fail. The strings had to be replaced before it could be tuned and the the replacements that came with it were no good. must be why its classified as a toy I guess. Good thing my daughter is young enough that it wont bother her but this was my first/ last purchase of a product of this type online.
5,If we break quarantine we could ALL die.,"Even though I've read many books by Alan Dean Foster, I was surprised by how great this novelization is. It feels like a director's cut of the film that includes some really cool preproduction ideas that weren't ultimately used - such as the face hugger having a giant eye on it's back, or even a scene where Ash intervenes on the alien's behalf. I loved it, and any fans of the movie will eat this up!"
5,Fascinating time with the author.,I met Orest Logusz while on an army tour. We've spent a good amount of time discussing one of our favorite subjects - military history. I discovered his fondness and expertise for the subject and added to that his Ukrainian background - thus the production of the book. He told me the reason for the writing was to produce a book that was informational and easy to read. You will appreciate the time and research put into his book.
2,"Biased, not a representation of Ukrainians","First of all, let the world know that 4.5 million Ukrainans fought in the Red Army during the Great Patriotic War. Only a small number collaborated and those were mainly murderous nationalists from Western Ukraine which was only Soviet occupied in 1939 and suffered greatly under the Poles. The author makes it look like majority of Ukrainians collaborated which is false. The author's anti-Russian attitudes are obvious as he constantly refers to 'Soviet Russia', not Soviet Union or just Russia. Still a good book for overall information on the division whose volunteers betrayed their country."
2,Not the US textbook,"I bought the paperback thinking it was the same textbook as the hardcover. It is not! I got an indian textbook with problems in the wrong order. Plus, the pages were very thin and the writing was hard to read."
5,director's cut,This movie was originally 140 minutes. It was cut to 113 minutes by Harvey Weinstein. Only when the version that the director wanted is released should anyone buy this movie. Harvey Weinstein does not a creative gene in his entire body. So where does he come off chopping out someone else's work? Someone should chop off 20% of Harvey's body and see if he likes it.
4,DVD Crossing Over,"Harrison Ford in another excellent role, showing his versatility as an all around actor of the highest caliber."
2,Disappointed,"This film has a really good storyline However, the unrelenting foul language, which I suppose is typical of many modern productions, was extremely annoying and unnecessary."
2,Makes you realize .................,"This movie makes you realize how badly the United States needs to adopt a ZERO TOLERANCE ""shoot on sight"" POLICY to stop illegal immigration (aka.. Passive Invasion) and quit playing around with this issue.There should be ONE AND ONLY ONE process by which people (from anywhere) apply for entry into the USA that is FIRM BUT FAIR TO ALL.Outside of that single process, no other form of entry should be allowed .......... Period.This film seemed to have the intention and goal of making you feel sympathetic, but instead it was simply an annoying reminder of how soft and stupid we have become in this Western Society when it comes to creating Firm and Fair laws, and then enforcing them without fail.Now everything is an exception to the rule and slop prevails.An infuriating film that gets the blood boiling !"
5,Everybody gets screwed in the end !,Great movie!Action ... drama ... compassionLive the American dream!
2,What happened to this movie?,"What could have been a good movie, falls apart with the bizarre plot that tried to have too much in it. While that might works for such films as Shortcuts, Crash, or Traffic, it doesn't work here. The movie was also very choppy, I suspect there were some crazy choices made during editing. Perhaps the film in its original form would have been pretty good. Anyway, it just didn't work. Also, the soundtrack and background music is HORRIBLE and very distracting in several parts. What a waste of money and a good topic (immigration issues)."
4,Better than I expected,"I always like it when a movie exceeds my expectations. Crossing Over was a lot better than I thought it would be. I don't remember this movie in the theaters so it kind-of slipped under the radar. The plot was good and the A-list actors did a great job.Ashley Judd's plastic surgery was a bit disturbing because one eyebrow is about 1/2"" higher than the other one. She needs to get that fixed. It's creepy...Alice Eve was quite stunning and her part was believable and well played."
1,CHEATED!!,"I gave this book 1 star not for content but for misleading me. I purchased this book published by MBI publishing thinking I was getting a new title in reality all it was, was a repackaging of 3 older titles (U.S. Army Special Forces, DELTA: Americas Elite Counter terrorist Force and U.S. Elite Counter terrorist Forces. All part of the ""Power Series"") under one cover and title, now called U.S. Counter terrorist Forces. It would have been nice to have known this prior to my purchase, but the company failed to give an accurate description of the content or in particular that the content is a reissue of prior titles. This is the second time (U.S. Special Forces, this title had three older tiltes also; Airborne Rangers, U.S. Navy SEALs, and again DELTA, which now I have this title three times.) I fell for this ploy by MBI. It does not say much for me to have been taken twice, but it will not happen a third time! Ever!"
4,sizing difference,"One pair of gloves fit, the other did not. The vendor was very fast and kept in touch, Would use them again, even though not completely satisfied with product."
4,Well done very nice gloves,As advertised. Warm and look durable. Need water proofing. Overall an excellent buy.
3,Great glove but sizing runs small,"I bought these for my husband for Christmas in the XL size. The gloves are wonderful and seem to be very warm, but they were so small he couldn't get his fingers in. Surprisingly, they fit me just fine so we are keeping them for me and are now on a search for gloves that will fit him."
3,Pretty smelly gloves,Just received these gloves. There's nothing on them that actually says goat skin so you have to take the seller's word for it. They're made in China by the way; not Italy. Maybe the skin is Italian; I doubt it. They appear to be worth the price and the medium's actually are mediums but the real problem is the smell. These gloves really stink of some kind of tanning fluid and it transfers to your hand when you wear them. I have mine in the garage hoping the smell dissipates. I intended to keep a pair in the truck but not with that smell.
5,Best MCSE Prep Book!,"As Director of Technical Education for a university, I am always on the look-out for books that can be texts or supplements. I have found the best one available right now in Glenn Weadock's ""MCSE Win '98"" book!! I have recommended it for our upcoming course.Good work, Glenn, in filtering through all the techno-speak and getting to the REAL issues!!!"
5,best plot ever,"I have the Death Note manga through book 3 right now and I cannot wait untill I can get more!! This whole series is filled with suspense and it keeps you thinking, there are a lot of twists and turns. This is my favorite manga and I highly recomend that you try it. The plot is fast pace and so good that I must have read each book 5 times!!"
5,Good Shoe for a Beginner,"Not knowing a lot about tennis shoes, I chose this shoe because they weren't heavy. I use these shoes for commuting and they are great! Now I'm looking for the same shoe in lime green and yellow to match my jogging suits. To me, this shoe is like a well made sock and if you need to do a lot of walking but not intensive exercise, this is a good shoe for you. Especially since I'm not well versed on the brands and types. But I'm totally hooked on Asics much to the shagrin of my sister who is a Nike person..."
5,Sublime Understatement,"This is a budget-priced reissue and repackaging of a previously released recording on RCA, also available through Musical Heritage Society. It's not to be confused with the re-recording of the Brahms Cello Sonatas this pair later did for Sony.Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax give technically proficient readings here, allowing the tortured Romanticism of Brahms to shine through in his notes without gooey nor overt over-expression. Some have written that these performances lack the fire and passion found in others; I find that to be a virtue here as the music speaks well for itself -- understated, communicative, and intellectually engaging. The recording is comfortably close and the range of tones from both instruments are sublimely rendered. Very fine!"
5,"Ah, Brahms!","This is truly a wonderful recording of both Sonatas made when Emanuel Ax and Yo Yo Ma were hitting their professional strides. I am so glad that it is still out there and available. If you love the rich blending of Brahms Cello Sonatas, you deserve a recording this good."
2,Utterly ordinary,"Even with re-mastering, this recording and the interpretations offered by these two reknowned arists are perfectly perfunctory.If you are not familiar with these works, you will be enchanted by Brahms' writing. If you are looking for more masterful insight, energy, and musicianship you must hear Serkin and Rostropovitch on DGBrahms: The Cello SonatasAs for Ma and Ax (MaAx?) - well, this was not their shining hour."
2,a disappointing recording,"A very muddy midrange, and shrill high end make this a poor choice for adequately hearing the complex music of Randall Thompson. Often it is impossible to hear the altos and tenors moving under the sopranos. I love the compositions, but am very disappointed by this recording."
2,Disapointing recording,The recording does not capture the beauty of Randall's Alleluia Chorus. the sopranos are too strong and the other parts are lost in the mess.
4,space a travel from an Amazon book.,Some good info to learn the art of military travel. Although dated it helps on the ins and outs of an interesting subject.
5,Diffuser is the best new band of 2003,"I was given a copy of the new Diffuser CD ""Making the Grade"" by my co-star in my latest movie. I put it in my CD player a week ago and it has not left since. I listen to it every day before, during and after the set. It is truly amazing. 4 days ago I purchased a copy of ""Injury Loves Melody"". I received it today and I must say I am a fan for life. The lyrics and vocals are unreal. Make sure ya'll support these guys. Can't wait to see them in L.A.Tara Reidxoxoxo"
5,Good Stuff,"I went to tower to pick this album up specifically after i heard karma on the mission impossible 2 soundtrack. i waited 6 months for this album. Well worth it. good, straight forward rock. very solid and very good. wide eyes is my favorite song, so don't be a loser and burn this. go buy it and support a good band. stop piracy!"
2,I would look at other models,"I have had this belt sander for over a year and used it on 10-15 projects. It has a plenty of power and looks great however I have a lot of trouble with the tracking. I have tried different brands of belts and nothing solves the problem. If I watch the belt (not the project, which as lead to me over sanding and grooving the surface on occasion) and stop early I can prevent it from eating the belt. I have to stop every couple of minutes to readjust the belt. Some people do not have this problem...so maybe it is either user or specific machine issues. This is of great frustration to me. I am now looking for another model/brand."
1,Belt Eater,"Bought one on Sunday. Within 15 minutes of use it had eaten 4 belts. One jammed, took 30 minutes to clear. I read and re-read the instructions on tracking adjustments. Pretty simple it seemed, but it didn't work. No matter what, the belts migrated into the housing and were damaged in short order. Took it back the next day."
4,Excellent sander,"The sander performed well and met most of my expectations. However, the dust collection boot tended to slip off its mounting easily and required frequent reattachment. And the dust collection capability for coarse sanding is inadquate, leaving most of the sawdust on the floor beneath the sander. But, I didn't buy the sander for its dust collection capability. One trouble spot is the tracking adjustment. The mechanism seems to jam and once the tracking screw is tightened, it can't be released without forcing the roller back into position. Frequent applications of WD-40 seem to be helping. Otherwise, I am happy with the sander."
4,Great Professional-Type Sander for all Projects,"I bought this sander for my husband (birthday prezzie) because he builds birdhouses and makes park benches from logs. The perfect tool to smooth the seat area.So far the sander has run flawlessly, as long as the dust collector is kept emptied regularly. The balance is great and there's plenty of power to get the job done. My husband also owns a DeWalt chop saw and he loves the quality of these DeWalt tools."
2,"Tracking, Dust Collection woes.","I have a bear of a job I'm working on-- stripping a deck. I thought the DeWalt, being big and built like a tank would be more than up to the task.The tracking only works in one direction-- it pushes the belt out.. but over time-- waste that collects on the drum pushes the belt out-- and there's no way to correct. I always wind up shuffling the belt back on the drum.Trying to clean it-- the drum lock bolt broke off on first twist with a screwdriver.The dust collector-- it worked great at first with a festool collector attached. Then-- it must have gotten plugged up inside and I can't clear the tube. The drum can't come off because the bolt broke.Another dust annoyance-- the housing that connects to the vacuum pops off at the slightest jolt. A big powerful tool like this needs better attachments.There's a ton of power here- and with the right engineering-- this would be a winner. But I can't recommend with the flaws. Choose another."
4,Pretty good sander,"This is a good sander. I have always used the Porter Cable 3 X 21 but took a chance on this because I burn up two Porter Cable motors in a row. Better balance, not as good of a dust bag. Quality seems to be there."
4,"Good sander, needed parts.","When I received my sander, I tried using it right away. It immediately ate a belt. What I didn't know is that the belt adjustment screw was missing. After checking out the manual I realized what my problem was. I called DeWalt and they sent me an adjustment screw right away. I've now used it quite a bit and have had no further problem with it. I did buy the dust collector attachment and use is every time I use the sander. I recommend it highly."
1,Not fit for a pro,this sander is the cloud on my sunny day. I've owned Three I know. cool look. will not last for more than a week of heavy use. buy a porter cable. the first one died in an hour. the second finished the job. Three days and then sat for a few months. first week it came out. dead. replace it. still under warranty. next one dies 2 days later. don't buy unless you will only sand with it maybe 30 hours of your life. or you like needless trips to the store.
1,disappointed,"Well what can I say? I like most of the Dewalt line of tools, but if they made the rest of their tools like this one, they would go out of business quick! The tracking was eratic,vacuum dust control doesn't work at all-(unless you hook a shop vac).And for the real clincher---the back drive wheel shaft started wobbling and vibrating after about three hours of total run time.I checked for a loose bearing or bolt but the wheel wouldn't move by hand, no play at all, which shows that the run-out was caused by the axle shaft bending-most probably due to poor metal quality. Took it back and got a porter cable 352vs--which so far has performed great after many hours of use."
1,Tried 3 of Them Before I gave Up!,"I would strongly recommend no one buy this tool! The first one I got wouldn't track at all so back it went. The second one tracked much better, but the rear berings started sounding like a washing machine with rocks in it...back it went. The third and final one tracked so so, but it ended up not spinning (belt would not move) when you pressed the trigger. Back it went and I will now try the Porter Cable 360 VS or 362 VS.After this experience I doubt I will try any of their other tools."
1,Died after a half hour of use,I picked one up at the local home center. After using it for a half hour of sanding it died. When I pulled the trigger it would start then come to a halt in a few seconds. Checked the belt to make sure it hadn't seized up. My only guess is that it was a switch problem.Back to the home center and exchanged it for a Porter-Cable.
1,Dissapointed in Dewalt design,"First off, I own a bunch of DeWalt tools.I bought this sander and used it for about 3 hours before returning it. This is a heavy sander and requires a bit of work to use (seems like I'm fighting with it). The top front wheel sets up frequent vibrations which cause the sander to do tiny hops which leaves marks in the work. The dust collection seems to work, but the cooling vents seem to blow dust all over the place (not good for working in the house). This sander seems to go through sanding belts with little to show for it (don't know why).I switched to a Bosch 3x21 inline sander and it is a world of difference. No great effort to use (less fatigue) no cooling ports to blow the dust around, seems is use less belts for the same job, a whole lot lighter and does a better sanding job."
1,Broke after 2 seconds of use.,"I got this sander for my birthday and about 5 days later I used it for the first time.The project was removing some paint from a potato bin and smooth the surface.But when I put the sander on the bin the belt stopped moving. I didn't even apply pressure yet.The nut that holds the rear spindle on sheared off.Now I am a Makita guy and I was trying another brand for once.But I cannot only blame DeWalt, I am partially to blame too, I should have done more research on this sander.Back it goes and I will never buy any DeWalt tools again. I'll stick to Makita."
2,Don't buy,"I read reviews before purchasing and thought that the problems would be fixed by now. I used the sander to sand a medium-sized deck. Like previous reviewers said, it eats belts and blows dust everywhere. To empty the dust bag you need to unhook it from the sander, then pry open the dust bag clip. I accepted this process, but just could not deal with the dust blowing everywhere and the number of belts it eats. I heard that the belt problem was due to the newer roller design, which does not work. I returned the unit after about 3 hours of use and purchased a Makita."
2,got a lemon,"I was so excited about this sander. Unfortunately after using it for less than one day it was eating belts, the tracking adjustment did not work. It spewed dust despite frequently emptying the bag and was a huge disappointment. When I called Dewalt they had me take it to the local Dewalt store for return and said a new sander would be shipped to me. The service person said they would only repair it, not return it. I called Dewalt customer service then the store manager who finally agreed to replace it with a new sander. It arrived and the preliminary test seems hopeful."
1,Huh,"Well, seeing all the reviews here says it all. I've had one of these for a few years and only needed it once in awhile. Seemed fine until now. I was just out in the yard cleaning up some 2X6s for decking and it started smoking and now it's dead."
1,"Eats belt non -stop, avoid this design","I've done woodworking for 30 years as a hobby, used a lot of power tools over the years. This is one of my worst purchases ever. I can't make belts last more than a minute or two. Given what belts cost, this has become an expensive mistake. It's a rare mis-step for Dewalt, but one I had to pay for."
1,Expensive and seems guaranteed to fail,Far too expensive to be disposable. Bought the first DeWalt sander to do some rough sanding but with less than 20 hours it failed. Broke it down found the part and ordered this rather spendy piece. Got it all back together and got another hour before it died a terminal death. Had not experienced this with other DeWalt tools so bought another DeWalt sander on sale for $140. I may have got 20 hours out of the new sander over the next several months before it also died. Picked up a cheap Black & Decker sander for $59 at least when this one dies I won't feel too bad about tossing it.
1,not your father's dewalt,"When DeWalt were U.S.made they were quality tools. Tough, durable and you only had to buy them once. Now they are made in Mexico. Cheap, unreliable and you will only buy them once cause that is enough."
1,poor quality,the shaft for the belt drive sheared. I used this sander 3 times in three months. I wish I had read all the negative reviews before I bought this
2,Dust collection system does not work,"The sander works great! However, the dust collection system has failed to work at all after the first emptying. I called Tech Support for DeWalt and failed to receive any satisfaction other than for me to take the sander to a Service Center (approximately 170 miles away) for a determination from them. This is my first DeWalt tool and will probably be the last DeWalt tool I will ever buy!"
4,"Pure Diana Wynne Jones, which means, it's brilliant.","Dalemark is divided between the oppressed, tyrannical South and the more free North. Moril's family is a band of traveling singers between the two earldoms. When his father is killed, Moril must take on his powerful musical instrument, the cwidder, in order to keep his sister, brother, and their passenger, Kialan, safe. But, soon, he finds all them embroiled in the political struggle between the two earldoms. A struggle for their lives. Cart and Cwidder is more standard fantasy, not quite up to DWJ's style of magical twists and turns, but it's definitely DWJ with its clever and refreshing depth to the magical and emotional elements. And, as with all DWJ works, it is a classic. Grade: A"
5,Favorite Book as a Child,I first recieved this book as a gift when I was 10 or 11. The cover was beautiful; green with a red caravan on the front. It was then called Diddakoi. I have just finished rereading it myself and reading it to my children. This book should be considered a children's classic. It is a must read for my friend's children.
5,Blackberry replacement battery,"This doesn't need to be long, bought it, it worked and still works great. Great Amazon price! Highly recommended if you have the older models and need a new battery for it."
5,Blackberry Battery for 7200 Series,"The battery was shipped in a timely manner and received within the time frame estimated.It appears to be a genuine Blackberry product, having the exact same decals and form as the original that came with my 7290.The price was outstanding, in fact shipping cost more than the battery. Still, the delivered price was 1/4 the RRP"
3,Details Overwhelm Synthesis,"In a notably detailed book, so detailed that the average reader will probably skip 1/5 of the pages, it is disturbing that Prados was so bent over by balance, or imbalance, that he was unable to recognize in this presentation that Colby got nearly every important thing he did wrong, that tens of thousand of people died because of his devotional stupidity, that he cost the American people billions of dollars of treasure in failed adventures, and he was so un-self-conscious, so unaware of the world unraveling around him, he never knew what was up or how he might have actually dealt with it."
3,"90% good, ruined by last 10%","Once again, the ending of a Moning book has left me moaning. Not in so much agony as The Highlander's Touch, mind you, but it still left me stressed out and unhappy. By the end, so much is sacrificed that it's incredulous, bordering on ridiculous. All this flitting through time (backward, forwards, back again) is a jarring ride that leaves you wondering 'what's the point?'The characters are cut and pasted from other novels (the smart but had-a-bad-life heroine + lusty, rippling manbot who is the only person in the universe to realize she is a hottie). You've been hit over the head so many times by their 'instant love/nuclear sexual attraction/sheer joy of smelling each other' that you may be ill.Have I become so jaded, or is this author slipping?I think I'll read a spoiler for the next book and call it a day.However, the garderobe scene was great, and I laughed quite a few times. Three stars for that!"
3,While Waiting for Diana,"Diana Galbaldon fans should enjoy this ""Diana Lite"" romance. Unlike Gabaldon's ""Claire and Jamie Fraser"" series, this is really a ""ROMANCE"" novel with some history and science and pseudo-science thrown in. Gabaldon's books should be classified as historical fiction and not shelved with books such as this (which is too often is). But I'm not being negative, really. I enjoyed this book tremendously for what it is--there's hot sex and cool humor and I guarantee a good time for all time-travel, sexy Scot, spunky heroine-loving readers. Good airplane book, but if you follow the maxim: ""Never read anything in public you wouldn't want to be caught dead with,"" then you might want to tuck it inside an Updike or a Roth (or Shakespeare!). Read it and have a blast in the past!"
5,Wow!,"I have been reading my way through the Highlander series and must say each one gets better and better! Others cover the plot well, so I'll just say that the storyline is fresh and creative. It is SO satisfying to have Gwen and Drustan achieve their happy ending. Can't wait to read the story of Drustan's equally sexy twin, Daegus..."
5,Love the Highlanders,I loved this book. Ms Moning draws the reader into the novel and makes it real. One begins to believe time travel is really possible. Probably my second favorite in the Highlander series. Dageus will always be my favorite.
5,I love it!,"What can I say? I love ALL of the Highlander series. Karen Marie Moning has made me fall in love with Scotland, it's history and of course, the MacKeltars! She brings the scenery, the legends and lore, as well the characters to very vivid life! Score another bonus for Karen!"
5,Best in the series,"I've enjoyed all her previous books in this series, but so far this has been my favorite. Am dying to get to Adam's story, hope it is as good!"
4,Out of all 7 books. This is my favorite.,"This is such a great series, loved the hero in this one. Of all 7 books, to me, this ones the best. I did like all of them very much and there are so many funny lines and scenes in all the books. Very sexy and full of love, the kind that makes even your hands hurt."
5,Great Historical Romance,"Loved this book from the start to the end. Thought this book was great. Nothing bad at all. Extremely hot love scenes, a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. Loved all the characters, especially the two main characters. Karen Marie Moning is definitely an author I would read again."
4,A fresh new approach,This book made me laugh hysterically through the first few chapters. Gwen's reactions are exactly what could be expected of a twenty first century woman being confronted by a Scottish laird from the 17th century. Very funny. Great male and female characters.
1,Bored and Disgusted,I Couldn't get past the first three chapters. Sorry people I was just so bored and turned off by the overt sexual references I put it down and deleted. There is so much better material out there that I didn't want to waste my time with this one. I'm writing because if I had seen a review like this I wouldn't have thrown away $7.00.
1,Don't buy this book,"Please, do not buy her books. Learn from my mistake. They are poorly written, have an underdeveloped plot and underdeveloped characters....infact, in the 2 books that I read of hers, the characters were pretty much the same in both books. I couldn't tell any difference between the people in the first book and the second.....other than their names and jobs. All were 2 dimensional and sorely lacking any personality. So please, do not buy her books. Send Karen Marie Moning a message that she needs to learn how to write first.If you want a fantastic series about Highlanders, read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. Now that's good writing!"
1,Pornography in book form,"This was a horrible book - no story, just mentioning the male's genitalia constantly. I put it in the trash and will never buy another book by this author."
1,A complete rip-off,This is a complete rip-off of Diana Gabaldon's Highlander series and does not deserve recognition let alone a review!
5,Exceptional read,"Captivating her audience with yet another enticing Scottish tale, Karen Marie Moning proves her escalating skill as a writer with Kiss of the Highlander. Gwen wants a man. Desperately. And boy does she get one--a magic-weilding, time-travelling Druid. With issues.Engaging, witty, sexy--very sexy, heartbreaking, and downright hysterical in places, Kiss of the Highlander follows suit with Ms. Moning's previous titles. Surpassing the standard romance stereotype, there's an honesty to her writing that strikes a strong chord in her readers. This is a story that will definitely linger in the audience's hearts and make them thirst for more...especially Dageus's tale..."
2,There Must Be More Than Blond Virgins,"This is book 4 in a line of 7 books that are loosely connected. KMM's books are typically light reads. You can polish one off in a few hours. Sexy, funny, adventurous... Good enough to keep you reading, but not anything that will haunt your thoughts. However, every single book, thus far, is so similar I'm not sure if I can stand it. Part of the draw is the romance, Scottish laird, etc. but goodness, there has to be more to it. Every single man is dark haired, over 6 and a half feet tall, a Scottish laird and warrior and has some major issues. Every woman in petite, blond, blue eyed and a virgin. Every book ends with babies. Every single book (maybe 5-7 are different). A small bit of variety would be great. Overall, the first few are good, but it starts getting really boring by book 4 because every character is the same as in the previous book."
3,It has its moments,"This book was given to me by a friend, who knows of my love of historical romance novels. I doubt that I would have purchased it on my own, mainly for the time travel aspect of the novel. I'm glad I decided to read it though. After a little bit of a slow start in introducing Gwen and Drustan, I found myself spellbound (for lack of a better term) at certain parts. Regarding the ""mystery"" woven into the story, I felt that could have been padded up a little bit more. Adding some depth to the characters involved in that part of the story line certainly would have made this a better story. I will most likely pick up ""The Dark Highlander"", simply to see how the story resolves itself; however, I'm not sure I'll read any other of Moning's books after that. I just don't think the time travel aspect is for me. As far as writing ability, I believe Moning is a talented author, and given different subject matter, I would gladly pick up all of her books."
1,Not for Outlander Fans,"Having recently returned from the world of Claire and Jamie in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, I was on a Scottish kick, so to speak. I picked up this book based on the recommendations here. Boy was I sorry! If this is an example of Moning's work, then I will certainly not read any other of her works. I found this book shallow and silly. Little detail is given to the physical setting, the characters were vapid and did not ring true what so ever. There is no real historic ""feel."" Overall, the book is cheesy. For fans of Outlander, I recommend the Into the Wilderness series by Sara Donati. Although it is not a time travel, the characters are strong and true, and there is a high level of historical accuracy."
4,Backwards Sleeping Beauty,"This book is excellent as I knew it would be. All of Karen Marie Moning's books are full of enchanting tales, erotic scenes, and the whispered promise of true love. Lose your self in love and time, that's what I did."
5,Entertaining and Magical!!,"I just loved this book. It caught my interest from the very beginning. The characters Gwen and Drustan were well developed, and I found myself lost in them. I loved Drustan's reaction to the 20th century. He was so curious, everything was exciting to him. The time travel theme was just great in this book, what an imagination Moning has. And of course, Gwen and Drustan's love for one another was magical and fresh. This book is a must read. You will just love the ending!!"
3,"review of"" Memoirs of a Geisha""","I enjoy the music,on one hand, because it brings back pictures to me of that beautiful movie.But the music itself is stirring and ,of course, Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Pearlman are magnificent! The music is almost my favorite part,even though some is redundant. If you enjoyed the movie,I think you would enjoy this CD"
3,Where is Japan?,"Problem for us is not so much the quality of Williams's score or the playing of Yo-Yo Ma and Itzahk Perleman.The actual film uses lots of Japanese music and even the Andrews Sisters. None of these appears on this album. Too bad the film isn't a bigger hit, or we might have seen a ""volume two"" with those pieces included."
1,85 million in WASTE !,"Simply a poor stereotype flick with a COMPLETE TOTAL WASTE of talent, music and MONEY.Fails in all respects EXCEPT amazing photography & score.But even Yo Yo Ma, Gong Li & Co. can't pull this Box Office flop out of it's failed lack of cultural research, depictions of Asian women as high class hookers & bad, phoney accents NOBODY on earth speaks. A regress of the 1930's dragon ladies. Anna May Wong is ROLLING in her grave ! A revelation to American movie crowd- They DIDN'T fall for the DRAGON LADY crap this time ! YAHOO!I'm just SHOCKED such fine actors of Asia didn't RUN off the set once subjected to such a screenplay. Shame on them for being in such dated, racist rolls.Hollywood, take notice & learn from another film about Japan that did GREAT, The Last Samurai. The director was SENSITIVE & SMART enough to do the research & make a great film American's and Asian can enjoy !"
4,Good Soundtrack,"I saw the movie and liked the theme music ""Sayuri's Theme"". It has got a haunting mood that is infectious. The ""Chairman's Waltz "" by Yitzak Perlman is also very Good. Overall a very good soundtrack by John Williams in conjuntion with Yo-Yo Ma and Perlman."
4,John Williams Does It Again,"Okay, so this is a score composed by a non-Japanese man. Forget that. This score is beautiful. John Williams certainly delivered. Different than his rousing Star Wars and Superman themes, the music here is very serene. Not only does it compliment the scenes beautifully, but it's also good music in its own right that you'll want to listen to again and again. Trust me on this. Buy this album."
4,Good music for relaxation,"Enjoyed the movie and the music. John Williams, Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, what's not to like!"
4,Love Soundtrack,I love the music on this cd I wish it was longer. As soon as I received it I had it in my cd player.
5,Memoirs of a Geisha musical score CD,"Good authentic musical rendition of movie. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to John Williams' orchestration of his music. When I heard the drum music, I could vividly see the young girl running along the maze to go to the temple to make her wish. The music had a ""patter of little feet"" sound to it! The other pieces were beautiful as well with a traditional, but at the same time, contemporary Japanese sound to it. I recommend seeing the movie ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and then buying a CD from Amazon. I got my CD in less than a week and it was in perfect condition!"
4,Don't miss this Soundtrack,The soundtrack really enhanced my experience watching Memoirs. So I naturally wanted the cd to this beautiful soundtack. It is not trademark John Williams sound. You can tell he came from a different place creatively with this soundtrack. It will immediately tranport you far east and with traditional sounds of flutes and beautiful sweet & whisping music. It is very relaxing to listen to but never dull that you will fall asleep. Anyone looking for traditional Asian instrumental music look no further whether you liked the movie or not.
4,Great soundtrack for a great film,"I appreciated a great soundtrack from Yo-Yo Ma. It's a subtle pleasure listen this music with the soul of the orient in our european mood. The music caught the spirit and the essence of the movie. It's hard to feel the geishas world. It's very simple to identifie them with ""easy girls"". They are the opposite. If You don't live or know the Japanese culture, You can't understand who is a geisha. The music from Yo-Yo Ma can guide You into this magic world"
4,Some very nice tracks,"This CD contains some very nice music and ""Going to School"" is one of my all time favorites."
5,Wonderful !,I loved the movie. I also ordered the book to read. And now I've got the music. There is not a track that I don't just love. This is my most listened to CD of late ! If you loved the movie this is a must have !!!
1,Thin gruel,"This book is thin gruel indeed. It is double spaced and large type presumably to make it thicker. Illustrations are of poor printed quality and too small. The author covers little if any new ground and is given to much conjecture with little documentation or footnoting. Particularly thin are the Mormon Batallion and California periods given the ample documentation that exists on these periods. I have read everything serious that is published on Baptiste, and this adds nothing to what is already out there. The fact is, little historical material exists on Baptiste, not even a photograph, although his contemporaries (like Beckwourth) were photographed. I waited longer than normal for the book and finished with it in one sitting disappointed. The most honest and best documented appraisal of Charbonneau's life is the 2001 Journal of Oregon History article, ""Sacajawea's Son: by Albert Furtwangler reprinted in 2004 by Oregon Historical Society Press and the 1933 Anne W Hafen biography."
1,Lots of errors,"I was, at first, excited to see a ""new"" biography of Charbonneau. However, this is mostly a rehash of available information. I found too many errors in this book to sustain any excitement. Wrong dates and quotations without sources are only a few of the problems. I'll wait for the new book being publised by Arthur Clark and keep my fingers crossed."
3,De Toverberg,"Hans Castorp, een jonge kerel die op zoek is naar iets, maar nog niet precies weet wat, besluit in het sanatorium te blijven waar hij oorspronkelijk alleen maar zijn neef ging opzoeken. Zijn 7-jaar lange verblijf biedt de lezer een zicht op de Europese geschiedenis en vormt tevens ook een parodie op die geschiedenis. Met allerlei karakters die ver uiteenlopen en soms ook vervaarlijk dicht in elkaars buurt komen, zal hij uiteindelijk als volwassen uit het boek komen. En breekt WOI uit natuurlijk ..."
2,Sickness and Death,"And a huge waste of time - no wonder there was World War I. One reason is that literary/intellectual/philosophy types don't have common sense and they get all of us in trouble with them. You may have to read the book to realize this (thus the second star). Yeah, please read the book a second time, a third time... to get the full meaning. Better yet, please memorize the book. And do it while you're staying at a sanatorium in Davos. And please lose your sense of time. How much would it cost you to stay at Davos?...Please stay for 7 years - it would only cost you a little more than [a few bucks]."
4,different,"The book is a new more beat up than I expected, but on the whole, everythings ok. Really good book"
2,Just like being there,"This book will give you a true insight into what it was like to be in a TB Sanitarium which is where the story is set. Reading it is just like being there. Dull, Monotonous, Tiresome, Going on without end.... If that was Thomas Mann's mission when he wrote it, then the book is an amazing success."
3,"Tough read, but hang in there","This book was difficult to read. It certainly is not a page turner like any Harry Potter book. However, it is rewarding if you are patient.It is about a young engineer, Hans, who ends up at a sanatorium. The details of the surroundings and characters are very detailed. He meets interesting characters from all over the world. The story lends itself to corcucopia of philosophical discussions and deep soul searching.While I can not see real people debate like Settembrini and Naphta did, I learned a great deal from the depth of their knowledge and their passion for what they believed in and why.Hans was no hero, but I still wanted to know what happened to him. I had a problem with the Ellen Brand sessions. I would have preferred some romance instead."
4,Good stuff,"Why not five? Because it touched brilliance but was not sustained. Fascinating ideas but still some ways to developing them into a serious set of questions we can ask ourselves about the world we live in. I am afraid Tolstoy did do a better job on that score in ""War and Peace"". But for a real example of a great 20th century novel by Mann, read his ""Doctor Faustus"". Without doubt his most complex and profound work. A near perfect synthesis of art, power, politics and everything else that makes up life."
3,wonderfully frustrating!,"I loved/hated this book! Maybe because I don't consider myself an ""intellectual"" - simply a lover of good stories. It was a wonderful premise for a story and a fascinating glimpse into life in a TB sanitorium - but I found myself wanting to quit reading several times whenever I'd be confronted by one of the intellectual ramblings (which could last for pages and pages) which I struggled to understand. The basic story was a good one - and finally towards the end of the book I relaxed a little and allowed myself to skip over these pages and enjoyed the book more without the frustration of plowing through incomprehensible text."
3,Required reading,Required reading for my son's college course. He is an avid reader so I'm sure he liked the book. Thanks
2,only 2 stars for the modern translation by John Woods,"The Amazon blurb states the translation is by H.T. Lowe- Porter and John Woods- but that's misleading- it is only by John Woods.I did not look at the book cover when ordering a replacement for my much-read, badly treated hardcover translation by HTLP, the original translator.At times, she is unwieldy and archaic, but Woods is charmless in comparison. Well, now I have both sitting side by side....If you can find an old second hand version, the first translation is, to my mind, much more evocative."
4,a few comments on translation,"... I found it to be a challenging, and very rewarding, work.My only disappointment with H.T. Lowe-Porter's translation relates to her reluctance to translate the conversations that take place in languages other than German. A pivotal 9-page conversation takes place mostly in French, and I was forced to find a second copy of the work in the Woods translation in order to read it."
5,Great book,Just as great as the rest! The story of Laura was very sad and heartfelt. It truly was a great book.
1,A History Lesson and not much more,If your interested in a history lesson this book is for you. Harvey Houtkin does a good job telling the of the origins of modern day trading and promoting his ego. If your interested in learning how to trade to make money pass this one it's not for you. The title is very deceiving. He doesn't really teach much other than history. He should have been honest with people and not implied that people would learn anything about trading.
1,Houtkin only want us to know what we owe him !,"If you are a novice trader looking for trading strategies, systems or any other educational information this is the last book you should consider to buy, this book only tells the history of Direct Access Electronic Trader (DAET) and what Houtkin did for the DAET revolution to succeed. Bottom Line: this book won't make you any better trader. I have read about 15 day trading books and this is the first I should not bought it cause is really a waste of time."
1,Not helpful,I didn't know there *were* any readers in Alabama. The reviewer below is a moron who is obviously a paid shill for Houtkin; I'm surprised he/she can write.
1,"Poorly written, sketchy, basically a waste of money","I was extremely disappointed. SOES trading is an exciting concept, but NOTHING in thisbook will prepare you one iota for SOES or any other electronic trading. He steers you to his costly on-site trading course and system. This type of operation has been in the news as several have gone bankrupt and ruined their customers."
3,Not the best of the bunch,"Since I've already read ""The Microtrading Revolution"" and ""The Electronic Daytrader"" most of this was rehash. Houtkin seems more concerned about the history of SOES and how he figured in all of it. There is not a lot of vision or insight into what it all means. He seems to be selling daytrading as a legitimate business opportunity for widows and orphens and everyone inbetween. At least the ""Microtrading Revolution"" admits that most people who attempt daytrading fail. I would rank this behind the aforementioned books. Nevertheless if you haven't read any of them, much of the info is the same and Houtkin's book wil probably suffice."
1,A real disappointment,"After I read the book, and especially after I read the last ten ""book reviews"" from 10/14 - 10/16, I was really disappointed. If the reader gets excited after reading this basically useless book and can't wait to do day trading, he/she is bound to fail as a trader. And I have to suspect who really wrote the comments.I have to agree with some earlier comments about this book - a total informercial stink."
1,HOOTKIN'S BOOK STINKS AND LACKS CONTENTS.,"I know for a fact that using the soes trading system one can make a very, very good living. Since I am already a soes trader and talking from experience. But, I must admit that this book is a sales pitch, and is comes short when it comes to useful trading knowledge. Also, the comments in the books that you can make, for example, a garbage man into very successful trader is nothing short of being silly. One must understand that day trading is a drain on the nervous system and not for everyone."
1,What a Disappointment,"Completely mis-represented. This book makes no attempt to educate anyone on how to daytrade the market. It is a compendium of the rules and regulations that Houtkin sought to change by becoming the ""Original SOES Banner"". All I can say is ""Be careful not to break your arm trying to pat yourself on the back, Harvey!"" If Amazon offered a 0 rating, this book would get it."
2,"no substance, lots of repititious history","I read this book, and THEN I read the reviews. Unbelievable, how most of these people can blatantly ""thank"" the author and praise his company. The book gives absolutely minimal strategies and explanations into what exactly one does when one day trades. Instead, the author bores you to death with the history of the SOES program and amazingly says the same things over and over and over. This is the first book I read regarding day trading and I pray that the next one is more helpful and ""teaches"" me something about trading that I can actually apply."
3,Good for introduction to SOES/NASDAQ LEVEL II,"I don't buy all these glowing reviews, but this was my first level II book, and a great indroduction to whats going on out there. Certainly not the end, be-all of daytrading. C.E."
1,bait and switch,"this rambling book provides no secrets or trading tips to help the average trader. rather it is a history of the authors efforts to level the trading field between the market makers and DAET traders. While he is to be commended for these efforts, by using this title to the book, and the paragraphs within, he is in fact just as guilty of misrepresentation as the market makers he rails against"
2,Dud!,"This would have been a good book if the author spent less time bragging about himself and more time writing about day trading. However, there are sections in this book a day trader should read."
3,Yes but,"Good for the most part, but I still prefer Trading Online: Step by step guide to cyberprofits by Patel (FT Pitman 1999), for its greater clarity."
1,"Better named ""My political war with Nasdaq""","As a book entitled ""How I'm saving the world from the NASDAQ"", its great, but if you want to learn about SOES trading, move on. I bought this book thinking I would learn secrets about SOES trading. What I got was a lot of attitude about the nasdaq. Even the subsections dedicated to techniques seem to be intended to support the author's war with the nasdaq rather than delivering advertised value to the reader. By the end of the first chapter, I was scanning each paragraph to see if it was more useless opinion, or if he had something useful to say. Useful trading information could be distilled down to about 10 pages. Can I have my money back?"
1,Underground Level 2 Daytraders Handbook is much better!,"This book was just as useless as the first soes bandit book by Houtkin which was nothing more than a shameless marketing piece. This guy is NO trader and should quit claiming that he is! It smells of late night infomercial stink! The information is old, historical and ancient and doesnt help an advanced daytrader worth a lick! I definitely feel ripped off.A much better book with real detailed HARDCORE level 2 trading (not just soes!) information and strategies is The Underground Level 2 Daytraders Handbook.Thats my opinion!"
1,Superficial and misleading,"After reading Friedfertig and West's book, I was looking for a better-written book with clear step by step explanations. This book isn't it. What I found was disappointing, superficial generalities and homespun ""rules of thumb"" that provided little solid information about how to day trade. Not worth reading except if you want a very beginning level book that doesn't provide enough depth to be useful."
1,A waste of time and money,"This author loves himself so much that he forgets to tell you about his trading strategies. One of the most egotistical, noninformative books I have ever read. Don't waste your time or money If you want to learn more about SOES, than take a course."
1,Harvey should offer his readers a full refund!!,As an active day trader I was hoping for some actual insight that might prove beneficial . I was thoroughly disappointed. This book provides an in-depth history of Nasdaq and how day trading evolved but does little else. The only helpful item from the book was the philosophy of being conservative and cutting losses. I am sure the author was handsomely rewarded but anyone who chooses to purchase this book will be very disappointed. The Electronic Day Trader and How to Get Started In Electronic Day Trading are far superior.
3,Some good info; mostly a diatribe against the NASDAQ bigwigs,"Houtkin spends an inordinate amount of time railing aginst the powers that be at NASDAQ. He does give some interesting info, but his book is chiefly an advertisment for his daytrader oriented brokerage services, which are quite expensive."
1,"Not much substance,poorly written","After reading this book, I felt somewhat empty. I didn't walk away feeling that any ""secrets"" were revealed. Some stories about actual trading examples would have been useful."
1,The book's cover inaccurately depicts the book's content,"~Don't buy this book if you are looking for information on HOW to day trade. The first half of the book is mostly an advertisement to join a DAET brokerage, 10% of the book is about ""His Battle-Tested Trading Techniques"", and most of th book is a hist~ other than Mr. Houtkin patting himself on the back, and certainly _no one_ needs to read so many pages of ego-stroking. The book is boring, and in my opinion is deceptively named. It should have been named something like ""The History of th Markets and AFTER I read the book in it's entirety."
1,How come McGraw Hill published this and Electronic Day Trade,"How is it possible that McGraw Hill published this book and Electronic Day Trader. Have they no shame? Are they just trying to capitalize on Electronic Day Trader's suprising success? Why don't they publish a more serious second volume of Electronic Day Trader for the advanced trader instead of just trying to skim the commercial cream. Publishing is a responsibility, particularly, in the financial arena. A waiver in the front of the book maybe legal, but there is a moral responsibility. Doesn't McGraw Hill understand that ""at the end of the day"" they share responsible for those readers trading on the skewed information they supply. Though not as extreme, it is similar to talk show host who set up situations where contestants get killed i.e.Jenny Jones and then disclaim responsibility and 1st amendment protection."
1,A disappointment!!!,"While Mr. Houtkin may have done great things to make the NASDAQ a fairer place for the individual investor, the book goes into this in detail with much self praise. What is missing is the specific daytrading strategies I was hoping to find. I consider myself a beginner to intermediate in terms of day trading experience and found no information which will make me more consistently successful. I wish I could return this book and get my money back. Otherwise this was a bad investment."
5,Great Intro to Direct Access Trading,"I was trading with ""e-trash"" before. I didn't realize what I was missing by not trading with direct access. Yes, the price of my trades were good, but who knows how much I lost by not having direct access, and letting them trade for me!"
5,I believe every school must be FORCED to teach about the holocaust,"I work on an ambulance I was in my late 30's to early 40's and came across a woman with numbers written on the inside of her right arm. I believed it was a phone number she was looking for, she explained what it was, her id number for her incarceration inside a concentration camp, she was a lucky survivor. Needless to say I felt terrible for my ignorance and realized that I had ran into a remaining survivor, something not many people encounter every day. Well I began to desire the knowledge of this subject and I read EVERY book I can so I may learn as much as I can about this needless tragedy. It has made me a stronger person reading this and ALL books on this subject. PLEASE READ THIS AND ALL BOOKS... It shocks me people believe it was a hoax. Tell that to the 9,000,000 people suffered death."
3,Mengele's story sheds no real light on the man's motives.,"Gerald Astor has done an excellent job recounting Joseph Menegele's life both before and after the Nazi regime. He paints a pretty depressing picture of a man with no remorse for his crimes against humanity while hiding from a world that hates him, and rightfully so, and the family that protected him. He also shows the greater impact that the personification of Menegele as Evil Incarnate had on the world and media. However the psychological motives for Menegele the man's actions during the Nazi regime remain a mystery. Perhaps this kind of evil always will."
3,5-star book for visual learners,"""Tom Lynch's Watercolor Secrets"" is a 5-star watercolor technique book for visual learners. Alas, I am not a visual learner, and so much of the impact was lost. If you are, I strongly recommend you get this book.All lessons are displayed mainly in comparison pictures: the same scene done two ways, once without the recommended technique, and once with the recommended technique. This is the ""salvage paintings"" stuff that other reviewers mention. These painting comparisons are scattered throughout the book and cover all topics. The comparison pictures are very effective pictoral representations of the technique lessons described herein.For myself, I don't like landscapes and I wasn't particularly impressed by the author's painting style. Still, this book has a lot of useful advice on painting technique. You might also considerPainting What You Want to See (Practical Art Books), which is the best watercolor technique book I've found."
5,Water Color Secrets,"In this book, Tom Lynch shares some great ideas which go beyond the typical ""how to do it"" remarks. He gives you information which allows you to create paintings with a more spontaneous and less 'studied' look, and he encourages you, as an artist, to look at subjects in a more creative manner.This is a very good book and one I intend to study, over and over, again."
3,I found the book to be lacking,"in examples of work done from beginning to end. It is filled with the artist's beautiful art work and that Mr. Lynch is a very accomplished painter is definitely not in dispute. However, I found the book tedious to read. Each picture is accompanied with an explanation why the picture had achieved oomph regarding design. Most of the paintings are of urban settings, i.e. of Paris, golf clubs, etc. and I am more of a nature and flower painter. I found the book to be not a complete waste of my money, but there are definitely books I like much better."
2,OK BUT NOT ENOUGH DETAIL AND EXPLANATION!!,THIS BOOK NEEDS MORE DETAIL AND TECHNIQUE IN MUCH BETTER FORM. I APPRECIATE GOOD ART BOOKS AND THIS ONE COULD BE A LOT BETTER..
2,Nice Art Work---Book Needs Better Text,"A great concept with wonderful illustrations by Tom Lynch but lacking descriptions of the techniques and pigment use employed. Like the other reviewer I found the secrets still secrets and not revealing enough information. This publishers books seem to follow this pattern as with Alvaro Castagnet book Watercolor Painting with Passion (beautiful and inspiring illustrations by Castagnet but lacking decent text of the techniques and use of pigments used).However, aside from the lacking technical information, Lynch's work is wonderful and inspiring."
4,ART with HEART and SOUL: an intreging overview,"I have been following Tom Lynch's work since the early eighty's when I lived in Florida. He is bright, easty to follow and full of valuable information. However, this book uses material from his previous works which are no longer in print and I found that disappointing. I was hoping to have some new inspiration. I would also like to see his videos again. I had several which were stolen from my home 2 years ago and I have not found them since. His videos are sensational for the student and intermediate alike. His work is dynamic but very easy to follow and yet full of brilliant color. Don't be afraid to ""dive right in,"" as he used to say."
2,Disspointing makes noise,we have tried this model before but this one was starting to make noise after only the second use which means it may start to fail soon..maybe a fluke but maybe the quailty has gone down..
4,Nice Purchase !,"As I get older, and like less stormy music, I find my tastes becomming more liberal. There is nothing wrong with soothing Harp or Flute music. I guess I'm mellowing out a bit. Being more accepting and tolerating diversity is called growth!!! This is essential as a life long learner !Every once and a while classical music connouissers buy a new disc or two, expanding their music collection and musical appreciation while defining their personal parameters, as was my case. I already own some Vivaldi, Mozart, and Bach Flute and harp music, so I gambled and was pleasantly surprised. Welcome and pleasing was this cd. Less strenuous and demanding listening effort is required. It can help calm you down, study, or fall asleep. It is beauteous and diaphanous, and when was that a bad thing?Reinecke was a German composer who taught Greig, Bruck, Frank, Fox and others.Have a great day !"
1,Not for me...,"I believe the original idea of this book was to get a closer look at astrology with African-American people to relate to (usually astrology reports don't do that) in a humorous way. But this book seemed more like it was talking down to me as I was reading it. It pissed me off because all this book did was add to the generalization and stereotype that hip-hop lovers are ignorant people who have to curse, fight, and be dumb in order to comprehend direction. I wouldn't advise anybody buy this book and I'm really upset that I wasted my money."
2,"Interesting, but dated","This slender volume, part of the AT ISSUE series, presents a range of scholarly journal articles, speeches, and essays about the future of the internet. It is interesting and was helpful to my research (I have to get up to speed with the dynamics of e-commerce because my consulting company has a client who wants to set up an online auction) site. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book to other readers. It was published in 1997; most of the articles originally appeared in 1996. As such, about half the discussion is outdated and not very useful. I suggest reading something more current, such as Bruce Judson's HYPERWARS."
4,Great lotion,I really like it. Does it work? I think so... My skin looks great and it doesn't make me break out. I ordered my second tube. I think it's a keeper.
5,Best night cream,"I love this cream, it soaks right into my skin, and since it has no sunscreen (it's hard to find a moisturizer without sunscreen nowadays!), I can use it at night. I use it with the C-Peptide serum and it really keeps my wrinkles at bay."
5,Best face cream for dry flaky skin,"My dermatologist suggested this face cream. It's expensive, but it's the only cream I can find that leaves my face smooth with no flakiness. My skin has a lot of sun damage. It's definitely worth the money!"
5,An ugly chapter of US history reviewed,"Mr. Hosokawa is a brilliant writer who had every reason to present a bitter portrayal of his forced internment experience at a relocation center where US citizens of Japanese ancestry were relocated away from the west coast following the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the entry of the US into WWII. Instead Mr. Hosokawa chose to take the ""high road"" and stick to an honest and unbiased appraisal of the situation. His is a very interesting and readable autobiography that tells of his advancement in the field of journalism and the effect his internment had on his colorful and successful career. The second half of the book includes excerpt from some of his editorials."
5,STURDY AND ATTRACTIVE,"I was looking for some way my 4 year old grandson could keep his many MANY small toys and toy pieces neat, visible and reachable. I found this 6-bin rolling storage shelfset. It's beautiful, rolls easily, and my grandon loves arranging his books, videos and games any way he likes on the top shelf and sorting out puzzles, art supplies, little cars, etc. in the bins. The entire piece doesn't take a lot of room. Each little bin has two big handles which makes it easy for him to bring one bin into the livingroom to play and then returning it to the playroom for another bin. Great purchase."
3,OK but not great,"I love the music of the Stones. But I found this documentary disappointing. As other reviewers have stated, not much here is new. Throughout the bulk of the movie, we get current voiceover interviews with old film footage playing. The Stones talk about their lifestyle and the atmosphere surrounding the making of this classic album. There may be one or two interesting film clips and Jagger and Watts returning to the mansion where they recorded much of the album is fun, but that's about it.I would have enjoyed a more detailed discussion of the classic tracks of the album. I would have loved to hear more outtakes (some are carelessly scattered throughout the movie) or a breakdown of the instruments tracked on each song. I guess for me, this documentary didn't focus enough on the MUSIC!Having said that, it's still the Stones, and it is fun to watch. If you are a diehard Stones fan, it's definitely worth seeing."
1,Fan trap!,"It's only a documentary build on a amalgamation of photos and pieces of films. Not really interesting...Some pieces of work sessions and some informations are relevant, but that's all.If you're a super-fan and a collector of the Rolling Stones you could buy it, but only to have it, not to enjoy to see ""THE"" band in creation; sorry.In fact, don't waste your time and your money (like I did)..."
3,GATHERING MOSS?,"Almost 40 years ago, in the spring of 1971 to be precise, the Rolling Stones left Great Britain and took up residence in France. They were tax exiles. Keith Richards found a villa in Villefranche-sur-Mer and it became the studio most of the band's masterpiece ""Exile On Main Street.""What makes Stones In Exile so interesting is the band members tell their own story. Through their words and generous archival footage, we hear of their time away from England and the making the incredible double album, which many fans regard as the Stones finest achievement. Bonus Features include significant additional footage and interviews. Not in Blu-ray, but still worth finding."
3,Good Movie,"The film was great, mostly b&w photos of the time they spent in France recording the album, with interviews narrating the events. However, the rental came without the bonus interviews with Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor, which I was hoping to see."
1,"If I want a video, I want to watch a video","Sadly, there's no real video here, only the old Stones talking and talking and talking, and some people I don't even know doing more talking and talking and talking... but almost no footage of EXLIE ON MAIN STREET!C'mon! If you don't have footage of Exile On Main Street sessions, then don't put a DVD on the market titled ""Exile On Main Street""! These dudes must really love money because I ain't see the need to do this kind of stuff.Usually I never never ever buy DVD of old bands (kinda ""never seen footage"" or ""lost videos"" stuff) because I assume (with reason) that there's no real footage of them - or if there is, is the same old stuff you've seen since you were born - and instead, you have a bunch of old and young unknowns talking and talking and talking.If I want a lot of words with little image, I prefer to buy a book with some nice pictures on it.I'm a fan of the Stones, that's why I fell for the trick... Owned."
3,"Deceptive running time, and something of a mess","STONES IN EXILE could've been a lot better than it is. The package says the film runs 145 minutes with bonus features, but the main feature is just over an hour. It's a puff piece to promote the recent EXILE ON MAIN STREET CD. Very little depth. Of the bonus features, it's amusing to watch Bill Wyman talk about Keef. I wish I had more to say -- after all, it's a documentary concerning the Stones's most creative period -- but there's so little substance to the thing."
3,Not that hot stuff,"I suspect that if you like the Stones on the one hand you will love this look at one of their most important albums, however also of you love the Stones it will not show that much new stuff. If you rae unfamiliar or do not like the Stones, then this is nothing at all to lok at. Indeed, it is not really a documentary on the meking of exile since tehre is no real footage that makes sense about that in here. What it does is convey the athmosphere surrounding the making of the album in the South of France quite well. It also shows the state the Rolling Stones were in when they left for tax reasons in the early 70's. There is no clear breakdown of the songs. Some of the additional interviews are quite nice but do not ilustrate enough what is perhaps one of the pivotal albums of the 70's. It is n ot expensive but at the same time it does not really deliver what it promises."
4,Lot's of handy phrases,"There are a lot of reviews saying that this book contains outdated slang, and is focused on phrases for picking up girls, etc. These type of phrases actually make up a very small portion of the book. The vast majority of content in this book is very useful and common everyday Japanese phrases, and the kind of stuff that simply *can't* become outdated. The phrases are all short and sweet, often just a single word. This is a very good book for beginners and maybe even intermediate level Japanese students. It focuses very heavily on casual Japanese, which doesn't get much usage in textbooks. It is important to remember though, that casual Japanese like this should only be used with friends or people you are close to. It can be rather impolite to use this style of Japanese with other people."
1,"How retarded, creepy, and stupid!!!","I'm Japanese girl working on my master's degree in my university in California. Most of American men who like Japanese girls have this ONE....Awful.Retarded.Even irredeemably foolish. They are fool. This book is much more FOOL. Makes you guys look more FOOLISH. Every phrases are OUT OF DATE like ""Are you from grand-pa or grand-ma generation?"". And all love words are creepy or useless. So retarded.If you use one of those phrases in front of Japanese girl, they would think ""YOU FREAK!!""."
4,Naughty and Nice!,"This series is a lot of fun. The romaji text is spelled really no-frills (See _Barron's Japanese at a Glance_ for precision in spelling and annotation). There is also no Japanese text. However, and this is a big however, the intelligence contained herein will get you much further than any other phrase book I've seen!"
4,I gave it as a gift.,All I really know about this book is that my son requested it as a companion to the first one. Make of that what you will.
4,beautiful hits,I always liked some of her music and she seems forgotten so I bought her album to keep her in mind shes different than others
4,Taboo-free underground cinema,"These are wild , disrespectful and dadaist films from the sixities. A cinematic supplement to the early records of the Mothers of Invention etc."
3,Worth 99 Cents,It didn't stink but this guy is definitely no Elmore Leonard.The story was OK but the writing kind of got in the way for me.Too much poor sentence structure & don't even get me started on the spelling errors.In addition; a lot of the scenes were just a bit too clumsy for my taste.It was worth 99 cents but I'd feel cheated if I'd paid $1.99 so get it now.
1,Why did I buy this belt sander,"I think I am on the third repair of this sander. Seems the switch has gone bad. The cord was caught in the rear of the sander between the housing and the drum and caused the shaft to strip. I can't remember the third problem.These are not all that good, that is why you can get a re-built one for $99."
2,Should have read the reviews,"Before buying this DeWalt sander, I failed to read the reviews. Now that it is on its return trip, I read them and concur with most. That I bought the DeWalt sander because I have other DeWalt tools that are great. Not my experience with this sander.My problem was it plugging up with sanding dust and required the careful extraction of sand dust to get the collector to work. I didn't have a problem with over-heating, but felt the tracking device didn't function (however did not have a problem keeping the belt tracking from a visual check). When the air blower passages were clean, the sander functioned well. But after a few minutes of sanding, I'd have to take it apart enough to remove the blockage ahead of the blower fan (good to have a high powered vacuum). Not a good design, IMO. I was disappointed."
2,defective dust colecter,The Dust collector keeps falling of. It seems to be placed in the wrong position. The locking attempt is inadequate.
1,"Kevin - Appleton, Wisconsin","I bought this belt sander kit at Woodworker's Depot in Green Bay, WI. I used it for less than 20 minutes and it literally burned up. I was sanding hemlock beams, and yes, I was running it continuously for the 20 min, but I thought DeWalt products were meant for heavy duty work. I was very disappointed in this sander; especially when trying to return it to where I purchased it, because they tried to tell me that DeWalt had only a 30 money back guarntee, when it is actually 90 days (what a poor retailer since they're the largest power tool retailer in northeast Wisconsin).I bought the Milwaukee belt sander (4X24) from Grainger. Let me tell you, you'll pay the price for Milwaukee, but this new belt sander burns me out!!!!! My advice, if Milwaukee makes it, buy Milwaukee, then Porter Cable, then (maybe) DeWalt."
1,A POORLY DESIGNED AND MARKETED TOOL!,"DEWALT DW433 Heavy Duty 8 Amp 3-Inch by 21-Inch Variable Speed Belt Sander with Dust CanisterA heavy duty belt sander without a good dust collection setup is worthless and this sander has one of the worst I've ever seen. In addition to poor design, DeWalt doesn't include a hose adapter with the sander - you have to purchase that seperately. This is ridiculous considering the cost of this tool. Alienating customers over a piece of plastic, that probably costs DeWalt 20 cents to make, seems like a monumental marketing error. I have several Dewalt power tools but will most likely not be buying any more."
3,New doesn't mean improved,"I like Dewalt, and have several tools made by them. When I came into the market for a belt sander, this was on the top of my list. Not so much for the name, but the features seemed to make this a solid choice. Went to Lowes, bought one and when I got a chance to use it, was completely disappointed. It seems agressive enough, but the tracking stinks. The belt continues to roll off. I have the tracking knob almost completely loosened, and it still didn't help.Brought it to be serviced. They fixed it, but after less than an hour of use, the same problem. I'll bring it back again, but between time and gas spent, it sure isn't worth the hassel. I like Dewalt, but I don't like this belt sander."
5,"a very dynamic,moving,well constructed,emotional album.","AMAZING!!-more dynamic and experimental than the last record,but remains true to the band's unique unity in their music.-JIMMY EAT WORLD remains my favorite band, solidifying that spot with this beautifully composed album!!-If they could only get airplay!!They would attract a huge fanbase.-5 stars for CLARITY!!"
5,Took a few listens for appreciation but now....,"Ok, my friend gave me this CD and simply told me thier amazing and so i was expecting something like get up kids or blink 182. Its not...straight forward its not. And i didn't like it, but it stuck in my head and now i just love the CD, i took me a few listens to appreciate the not so punk music but, its simply awesome. Get this album, its sweet. And its beautiful too. i mean, all the other music out thier today is just fast hard and angry, this was a relief from all that."
5,Best CD by the Best Band.,"JEW rocks. Their music is the only stuff that has ever really spoken to me and I think that everyone should buy this album. If you already own it, buy stay on my side tonight. It is almost as brilliant."
4,Get it for the last track.,"In all honesty, I dont like this album much. Crush is a good song, the first tracks pretty, its all OK. But go to any lengths to hear the last track, ""Goodbye Sky Harbor."" Its sixteen minutes long and absolutely perfect. Youre just going to have to trust me. This is up there with ""Transatlanticism"" by Death Cab For Cutie as a timeless indie-emo epic. You must hear it."
1,MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL,"I read great reviews of these guys everywhere, so I blindly bought this CD. With exceptions of a couple o.k. songs, Lucky Denver Mint and Ten. My skin literally crawled when I listened to the rest, like when you have your socks on in a sleepng bag and its hot out. It's amazing that music can be like torture, but that is what this CD is. Why do people call this indie anyways, they are signed by Capitol, just like one of the old New Kids on the Block."
1,"Can you say, BORING?","The positive.#1: Lucky Denver Mint is a great pop song. #2: They are good musicains. #3: The singer has a decent ""emo"" voice. #4: Mark Tromboni (ex-drive like jehu) produces the record.The negative.#1: Goodbye Sky Harbor is 16 sixteen minutes to long. Jimmy Eat World is not Mogwai. JEW just can't pull of a sixteen minute song. #2: The lyrics are just plain bad. I point to 12.23.95 as an example. JEW's lyric writer is not the next John Lennon. #3: 16 songs is too much if the songs aren't even different from another. #4: the record is just plain boring.matt."
2,"I Agree, Boring","I am a big Jimmy Eat World fan. I own all their CDs and I was just recently able to get this one. I was excited because of everyone saying this is their best CD. I strongly disagree, and completely agree with the reviewers who say this CD is boring. I only liked 2 songs out of the whole album. And a 16 minute song? Come on! Who actually listens to that all the way through?If you're new to the JEW scene, get their self-titled, Futures or their new Chase This Light and steer clear of this one."
4,Some of the best work from Jimmy Eat World,"This album is by no means perfect, but it contains some of the strongest material Jimmy Eat World every wrote. ""Lucky Denver Mint"" is the highlight of the album, but ""Sunday"", ""Ten"", and ""Just Watch The Fireworks"" also have a special place in my heart. ""Goodbye Sky Harbor"" while listenable, tries to be an epic lasting over 16 minutes. Lasts about 10 minutes too long, in my opinion. The overall feel of the album early 2000's emo, but not the ilk of My Chemical Romance or the Used. Highly recommended; ""Clarity"" gets more listens from me than ""Bleed American""."
4,"I'll be honest, I *enjoy* pop","I'll be honest I bought the self titled Jimmy Eat World CD because I *really* like the song Sweetness, and I knew it was ""pop"" I didn't care. so anyhow, following how much I really liked the CD I could relate to almost every song on the CD (namely My Sundown, The Authority Song, Praise Chorus) so when i picked this CD up i was hoping for more of the same. WRONG, this Cd is almost an entire different entity, at first I'll be honest I didn't like the CD, but then I listened to it in solitude, not in 15 minute stints on the Bus, and I listened to some song's lyrics Like ""Sunday"" I'll admit it doesn't sound like the Jimmy Eat world I listened to that were singing about Not having the good things concerned with them, however this CD relates more to my love life.. or lack of, about mist clearing from eyes and such, This IS a good CD it takes some time, but once you listen to it through, Its VERY good"
5,Beauty in music,"The first time I listened to this album, I cried. That is just how incredible it is. JEW has the unique talent of making something that is relatively simple, and make it sound beautiful. Hardly a day goes by now where I don't listen to this album. My personal favorites are Table for Glasses, Lucky Denver Mint, A Sunday, Goodbye Sky Harbor, and the greatest song of all, For Me this is Heaven. I highly revommend this album to anybody that cares enough to read reviews first."
5,Jimmy Eat World freak,"Oh MAN! I had to say after lsitening to Clarity the first time. Wow well I heard the Bleed American CD before listenign to Clarity. I listened to it and though Bleed American obviously so obviously I borrowed a copy of Clarity from my friend. And to say the east i was stunned from an awesome beginning of Table Of Glasses Lucky Denver Mint from upbeat tiles of Believe In What You Want and A Sunday. To an awesomer ending of Goodbye Sky Harbor. I was so amazed. All Jimmy fans out there who don't have Clarity i tell ya GET IT, it's even better than Bleed American"
5,JEW - Clarity,"One of the best albums ever - emo music at its best. Lucky Denver Mint is awesome and the rest of the sounds have a lot more emotion than the previously released ""Static Prevails"" - a definate buy."
5,Sweet action,"My favorite album, this is a must have. I can listen to it over and over and never get sick of it. It's one of those cds that if you listen to it while you're doing something else, you'll find yourself stopping continuously to lose yourself in the great music and lyrics that speak to your insides."
3,A Nice Christmas Present,I received this for Christmas and my first reaction was 'What the heck is this?' After several listens I started to realize this is pretty good stuff. 'Jimmy..' utilizes nice harmonies on several of the tracks. The only two worth exceptional interest are the first track and 'A Sunday'. The others are by and large pleasant but bland. Stay away from the final track. It repeats the same thing for 11 minutes. It made me want to bash in the CD player.
3,Okay,"This show is okay but I wasn't the biggest fan, a friend of my made me watch it. I didn't even get through the whole thing."
3,The O.C.'s best,This is The O.C.'s best season by far. Its the only one that I actually wanted to own.
5,The Best Season Next to the First Season,"The second best season out of the four. It really got me loving the show again. Even though it is a shorter season, with 16 episodes instead of the usual 24 or 25, it makes up for content with quality. This season has a fantastic primiere and a great finale which caps off the show so if you love the O.C., then you will want to buy this DVD set."
4,Nice ending to the OC story,"It's not as good as the earlier seasons, at least not as brilliant as the first one. But it's a nice closeur to the story about the Orange County. And I got as hooked as always!"
1,never got it,"I paid $35.00 for international priority shipping but DHL in Peruhad the nerve to ask for over $50.00 in handling fees, which I refusedto pay, as USPS's receiver in Peru only charges $8.00 for that service."
3,It had to happen... for everyone's sake.,"The OC was finished half way through season 3. Whoever said season 2 was mediocre... you know nothing about good television. Season 2 was the best season in all of tv history! It was amazing!!! Season 3 started to lose me, but I still watched faithfully, and when season 4 came around I was done. Hercules is Ryan's dad!? And Julie falls in love with him!? C'mon... tacky tacky tacky. I was ready for it to be over because they lost me. I still give 3 stars, though, because it's the OC! I thought the very last episode was better than I expected, and it ended in a way that I didn't have questions. If you haven't seen the OC before, don't start with any of season 4... Please..."
1,WORST SEASON EVER!!!!,"I can't believe that they ruined The OC with this dreadful season. The first three seasons were beyond awesome, and it saddens me to see The OC saying good bye with such a bad season.There were only two episodes that I liked: ""The Night Moves"" and ""The End's not near, it's here"". So I guess they did gave it a proper ending with those last two episodes, but the rest of the season SUCKED!!I own the other three seasons on DVD but I will definitely not buy this one. I can't believe how some people actually liked it!!"
1,Why invest in a Mischa-less season of the O.C.?,"The O.C. was an amazing, wonderful show that reached it's peak at the end of the second season. The third season was retarded, and the fourth season was just goofy. What made the show was the relationship between the girl-next-door Marissa and straigt-out-of-Chino Ryan, and they literally killed that. And instead of giving some sort of presence of Marissa in season 4, the show's viewers are dumped in 5 months later, not able to mourn, and the characters essentially resolve their grievences for her death in 5 episodes. The O.C. ended with a very prolonged whimper."
3,All good things must end,"unfortunately, the OC 4th season hardly lived up to theamazing standard of the first three seasons. Without Marissathe fab four wasnt as dynamic, and taylor townsend was a stupidcharacter. It also seemed wrong to me that ryan is so unhappy andlost without marissa for a few months, then all of the sudden he'sall close with taylor. Ryan's Dad was also poorly cast, and the ""bullet"" guy was lame too.Overall this season faultered, and obviously died.If you want quality OC, buy the first 3 seasons,they're amazing. as for season 4, i can sum it upbest as.. ""ehh"""
3,Show got back to original quality,"The series got a little hijacked with Marissa and all her ""problems"" during the second and third seasons, but the fourth season got back to why we originally liked the show. I think that fans of the show will enjoy how it ended."
3,Season 4 DVD,"We'll I'm glad to see the DVD for Season 4 coming out soon since the show was done by February and it seems awhile to wait for October or November to release it, but seriously they want $42.00 bucks for a shortened season. Come on now, only 16 episodes! Does anyone else think the price should reflect the fact that this season was 8 episodes shy of a full season? That reflects a 20% increase on average per episode compared to past full season DVD releases. By my calculations this product should cost $33.45. Thanks for trying to screw the American consumer on a Product that was not only not good enough to earn a full season, but also got the entire franchise cancelled. Now let's hit up the true fans for an extra $9.00 per sale, times the number of copies sold, makes a nice hit for the sellers. Shameful! Don't blame Amazon though, Best Buy is charging a ridiculous $70.00 bucks. Talk about price gouging..."
3,Decent but could have been so much better,"Season 4 starts out with a grand slam out of the park home run beginning with the 1st disc and goes into bizzaro land by the 2nd (at times I got the impression they figured they were not getting renewed so they simply had a little fun).By the 3rd disc it gets much better, but ends on the 4th disc as simply OK. I do not like extended time lines in series who are trying to wrap things up quick. I felt an open ending would have been more powerful. Thankfully they're were a couple of shows that showed the old spirit. Over all I'm glad to have watched the last season but it could have been so much better."
3,Objects might appear larger/smaller than are.,"The pictures on the web for this video light do not convey the actual size of this light and its battery pack. The light in the picture looks big compared to the battery. However, the light is actually smaller than the battery pack. The light is 2.75in Wide x 1.75in Tall x 3in Deep (excluding the mount, which is 2in tall). However, the battery pack is a heavy 3.5in Wide x 4.25in Tall x 2.5in Deep. Also, the battery charger is old-school and has to be timed and unplugged to keep it from overcharging the battery. One other thing, if you are looking for a really bright light, you might want to choose another light. With both bulbs on it's only 40watts. Compare that to your house lights 60, 75, or 100 watts, and then ask yourself if 40 watts is enough light for your needs."
2,Need Wireless,"The Playstation Network Adapter is great for broadband and dial-up, but where is the wireless? Xbox came out with a wireless adapter, how about the competition. My primary internet connection is upstairs in my office, where my computer is located. My Playstation is downstairs in the entertainment room. My internet provider (Comcast Cable) will not allow me to connect another cable modem in the house without doubling my internet bill, so my only alternatives are to move my playstation and TV to my office, or use the wireless capability of my modem upstairs. Oh but wait there is no wireless capability for the Playstation Adapter..."
1,Did not work,I wasted money because the adapter does not work. It would cost me a hughe headache to send back and spend more money then to just throw it in the garbaage where it belongs!
2,"NOT BAD, STILL BETTER DEALS OUT THERE",This item is priced okay. But ive seen it at some places for $34.99. Go look at bestbuy.com or circuitcity.com
1,Doesn't work on old PS2,"I have one of the first PS2 systems that ever came out and the discs that the adapter comes with aren't readable in my system.All of my other games (including new ones) work fine and these discs work well in newer PS2s, but there's no way for me to use it.It was wasted money for a pipe dream."
3,not all it is cracked up to be,"I bought this item thinking it would open up a ""whole new world"" of gameplay and breathe new life into some old games in my collection.After having issues with the installation of this adapter to my desktop and PS2 with a router, I pitched the router to the side and went straight from modem to my PS2. Success. Well, sort of. Sure, it worked like it was supposed to, but I didn't really enjoy playing on-line too much. I tried out a couple Pro Skater games, but failed to really see any real difference in gameplay. Lots of games were full, and the ones that weren't, well, I didn't stick around too long. After maybe 30 or 40 minutes, I popped in Vice City and realized the adapter was a waste of time and money."
3,Network is dying.,"The Hardware is good. I bought this primarily to be able to plug a hard drive on it. But to really exploit the hard drive capabilities you need a third party software that is not Sony approved, so I won't talk about that here.This item is mainly a Networking device and as networking goes, sadly for the PS2 it is dying.I do not understand why this is. Networking is thriving for the PS3, one would think that the same servers could maintain channels for ps2 players. I guess Sony is trying hard to kill it's own child to push the ps3 to the customers.Again the hardware is good and I'd recommend it for Hard drive uses. But again, you need to check HDD compatibilities.If you are interested in the networking, check the game support first on the internet.P.S.: I don't know why the picture is bluish. The device is a perfect black match to the PS2."
4,It does the job!,"Nowdays PS2 game consoles have a built in ethernet. you wouldnt need this, but since I am old school, I ahve to have old stuff, so I have an old PS2 that requires this adapor. And it works fine ONCE you download and configure your PS2 for it, but eevrything it good."
1,I haven't received my Ps2 N.A.,It's been over a month and I have not received my network adaptor. Promised to send but nothing as of 12/06/02.
3,There isn't really a point at the moment,"Although I must admitt that I broke down and bought one of these, there really isn't a point to having it. The only online game at the moment worth playing is TimeSplitters 2, and I am getting that for X-Box, not PS2. So it will probably sit there for at least another month or so, collecting dust."
1,Help me god,Ok I bought the go-net adapter yesterday w/out knowing anything about how it works. after reading online reviews i got the idea that the sony network adapter is a lot better so i might switch. Does toys r us give you a refund on opened items?anyway i have satalite tv so i dont really need cable working in my house but one cable jack is turned on for optimum online. would having another jack open make me pay more money each month or is the whole house the same amount? also can i use both cable jacks at the same time? and do i need a second cable modem? please answer my questions someone anfd tell me how on earth u set this thing up because i really want to play Socom 2 online soon. email me at HGAgdere@aol.com or IM me (HGAgdere)thnx in advance
5,this adapter looks awsome,"I read about this adapter and they say it will let you hook up PS2 to 56K commections and broadband (DSL, Cable, and T1, T2, and T3)connections. It also includes a coupon for Twisted Metal: Black Online. Just use a cord from your computer to your PS2 to hook it up, as simple as that! I pre-orded this game and I suggest you do too"
5,HOW TO SETUP IF COMPUTER IS IN ANOTHER ROOM,"I just bought the Playstation Network Adaptor for my son but his PS2 is in a different room than the computer. Best Buy also sold me a ""Net Extender"" which is wireless and is supposed to connect the PS2 to my cable modem in the other room. The ""Net Extender"" was ""pricy"" and I'm wondering if there would have been a better option for connecting these two together. I tried a wired router but couldn't get it to work. If anyone knows if the Net Extender is a good buy and worth it, let me know!! I don't want to open it until I know little more about it in case I decide to return it and try something else.Thanks"
1,helps please,if I buy this network adapter will i have to pay every time i used this ( Please tell me ) email me at soccerplyr13@verizon.net
1,How do you set it up?,Guys I dont know how to set this up I tryed with my phone cords and internet. I tryed and tryed and I really wanna play online. So guys if you can tell me how to play online ill play socom with anyone. so just e-mail me at fender_strat_kid89@hotmail.com so please guys help your fellow PS2 buddy.
4,"Good product, but safeguard the network utility disk","Good product - works well... BTW, this product comes with a network utility disk. The PS2 must boot this disk in order to allow a network game to use this adapter. Whatever you do, PROTECT THIS DISK. If you lose it, damage it, etc. the only way to replace it is to buy a whole new network adapter. Sony does not make the disk available separetely (at least not at this time).This item appears to be sold by Toys-R-Us through Amazon. I noticed the price is higher than manufacturer's suggested retail. :-("
1,Warning check your model before buying,You DON'T need this network adaptor for the PS2 slim editon (SCPH-70012) this unit aready has a built in network adaptor.
1,Where is my Order,I keep getting the run around on my order. It still says it is will be delivered Nove 27. I am in the same boat as gamer. Now it says that they do not even stock them. I do not think i will ever see it. CS has been giving me the run around to
3,Confused,I bought the Network Adapter and have it hooked onto my PS2 but I cant figure out how to get it connected to my Cable modem. Everyone said its easy to set up but i cant get it...
3,NO USB,"great idea. but no usb support. meaning this connot be used by the thousands of dsl,cable,satellite usb users. sad."
2,Fun....for about an hour,"I received a PS2 Network Adapter for Christmas in 2002. It was easy to set up, and soon I was playing Madden online! Shortly after my first game, my daughter tripped over my controller cord and the PS2 slid about halfway off the shelf. No biggie, right? Wrong. The PS2 wouldn't read the Network Adapter after that. I tried putting it into a friend's PS2 and it worked fine. I would basically have to pay to get the problem resolved with this PS2, or buy another. I voted NO on both options. Upon looking into this situation online, I noticed that other people were having the same problem with minor drops and bumps to the PS2.Bottom line: Treat it like it's made of glass!"
3,"PS2 Online... SO, SO","Of the two consoles currently participating in online gaming, microsoft has done a much better job than sony in my view. First off how can you have a good gaming expirience with dial up. I was a beta tester for xbox and have played on ps2 online. As a beta tester I found out quickly that this is one of the greatest things that has happened to the gaming system. For 50 bucks the xbox kit is well worth the price. Not only does it include the headset (which fits well and works great) but it also includes a whole year subscription to xbox live. You can also mute and adjust the volume on the communicator. For the price of a single game this is a great deal! I also think that the PS2 adapter is a great value but cmon you have to pay subscriptions to select games. So if you cant make that final decision I would reccomend xbox live, but if you only have a PS2 then go with PS2 online."
4,Help,Hey someone please help me. I got my internet adapter for my playstation 2 not to long ago but have yet been able to play it. I set it up and connected but when i went to play Socom 2 it would not let me. It comes up with an error saying the hardware is not set up or can not be read.Email me at the_jackal_52@hotmail.com
3,no usb support,"great idea. could have been more thought out, especially since they didnt include a way for all of us usb(dsl,cable,satellite) users to use this...."
4,A add-on that you must have.,"This is an excellent device for your playstation 2. I would not suggest using it unless you have cable internet or something of that speed. Signing up and configuring it is a little complicated if you have a novice level of playstation and computers. Other than that, buy Socom 2 and you will never leave your house again."
5,question,do you pay monthly to have this online service or does it just go to your regular network bill (i use broadband not modem). if you could write the answer up as a review or send me it at jp4est@aol.com i would appreciate it greatlythx
1,Good for gaming-bad investment,"Ok, I admit it, its really fun to act like you're a really Navy SEAL, but the adapter is terrible. I had it for 3 months, and it broke. I don't know how, but i tried to play Socom again, and it said it didn't detect a network adaptor. I tried to play Madden, but it wouldn't ewven load. I don't know whats wrong, but im really mad."
1,can not use,"can not use it was not all there will not work,was a waste of money will not buy anything else"
4,lil help here,"Man, I can't wait to get this thing. Lots of games I want to get for it. I just want to make sure it would work with a dial up modem. If you wanna help me out and tell me, my e-mail address is rick_a_shae@yahoo.com"
5,Awesome!,"Recently purchased this for hubby and he LOVES it. Started out with the dial-up connection (for a couple days) and then hooked it up with cable modem. Works pretty good with both except on the dial-up, the games tend to freeze a bit. This is better with a broadband connection...it is WELL worth the price! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! :)"
1,Notworth Adapter,"This could have been a wonderful product if sony didnt keep its consumers in the dark with compatibility issues. My personal experience with the device has been nothing short of disaster. First of all if you have a PS2 from the first release shipment batch with the firmware version 1.1, as in my case, do not upgrade.Go with a usb network adapter instead. At installation and detection of my network router, it told me i need a firmware update, and once i downloaded it froze and erased all my game data from both my memory cards."
4,A Stellar Anthology,"Datlow and Windling (whose other compilations have included Silver Birch, Blood Moon and Black Swan, White Raven) have outdone themselves yet again with this latest treasure trove of modern and retold fairy tales. Containing both marvelous poetry and haunting prose, it is a must have for lovers of fantasy stories. Reader's will enjoy stories such as Tanith Lee's (author of Black Unicorn)""Rapunzel"" and Bryan Kanar's ""Dreaming Among Men"", a vivid and wonderful native american story. This is a collection definately worth picking up!"
1,What Makes A Classic Sermon?,"Wiersbe's collection of classic sermons on the resurrection of Christ is disappointing fare. Twelve sermons are included. They come from such luminaries as Alexander MacLaren, D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, Harry Ironside, and Charles H. Spurgeon. What disappointed me was the effusive, even excessive use of pulpit rhetoric, and the absence of concrete insights into the meaning of the resurrection and gospel stories associated with it. Only four of the sermons provided this kind of help for me. So, this raises the question as to what constitutes a ""classic sermon"" for author Wiersbe? Since this is only the first compilation by him I have read, and it may well be the last, I do not know if the selections here are representative of his view on the subject. If they are, however, he seems to prefer praise, repetition of assertion, and abstractness over against concrete and insightful analysis, illustration and exposition."
3,Peaceful World....,"A fellow Rascals fan sent me this CD as a gift. The Rascals have always been my favorite band but somehow I lost track of them around the time they released this CD. What a great feeling to be introduced to these old friends again...their music is timeless. While this CD is very different from their earlier work (and Eddie is gone), each & every song is well worth the listen."
4,It ain't so bad.....,"This is a tough album to review because it isn't a true Rascals release, just Felix & Dino, & it is flawed. The concept was good: taking off from John Coltrane's spiritual plane. But the jazz musicians, with the exception of Alice Coltrane, aren't good ones for the job. So it settles into an easy listening groove that almost floats away on good vibes. Yet, as early, somewhat funky new age music it ain't so bad. Every song gives up a nice riff or two. A couple of songs are first rate, particularly Love Letter. The ethereal spaces of Mother Nature Land & Little Dove are hard to resist. The title cut is very nice makeout music. Dino plays great throughout. & the price is real good for what was a double LP. No point in complaining about Peaceful World. You'll know if you need to have it in your collection. I do. But if you prefer unqualified praise, don't listen to a 20 year veteran of New York free form radio.Bob Rixon, WFMU-FM"
4,The title says it all,"I used to listen to this album over and over on my 8-track player while sitting in my Bug at Sandy Beach watching the body surfers and waves. Good music, good memories!"
2,Nostolgic purchase,"I had this LP in the 70's. My son stepped on it and broke it and I have bemoaned the loss for more than 30 years. I was delighted to see this CD. But when I heard it, I wondered why I had missed it so much. Yes, it was the Rascals step toward a jazz/rock fusion . . but?? Maybe I have changed. The thrill was gone."
1,stupid cheep chair...thats what they should call it.,Way too small for anyone else but a 4 year old....cheep as hell and not worth the time. Don't bother!
5,closetmaid organizer,This was one of the best purchases I've made in some time. I definitely created A LOT more space in the closet! Was pretty easy to install. Would have been even easier had the ceiling in the closet been level. But that's not the products fault.
4,Good as long as your closet falls between 5 - 8 feet,"I bought this to ""make over"" my sons' closet. Since they are twins, I was worried about having enough space for everything. It was great, unfortunately the closet was a little over 9 feet. We made a few adjustments to make it work, but it would have been nice to have it working in a closet our size. I didn't like the ones for a closet over 8 feet."
5,REAL fake cheese!,"The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook: Delicious Dairy-Free Cheeses and Classic ""Uncheese"" DishesThese recipes are not only some of the easiest (a spoon or blender is the highest tech I have used so far), but the most delicious uncheeses EVER! I have tried many mac n' cheese boxed uncheeses, bottled uncheese, and block uncheese. These recipes don't have a lot of soy, and therefore lack the chalkiness you sometimes get with the uncheese you buy in the store.The one drawback to these recipes is the unique ingredients. I love the cashew butter chedder, and the white bean boursin (with umi boshi paste to make it tangy!). Some of these ingredients can be pricey (especially if you insist on the organic options, but the flavor is awesome because you can feed them to your cheese eating friends as ""white bean spread"" or ""cashew butter spread"" and you won't get that puckered ""Fake cheese?"" face.The best I've had!"
3,Yummy recipes,If you're dying for cheese this book is a must have. I love her soup recipes. I only gave it 3 stars because some of the recipes are extremely hard to do right. A lot of hard to find expensive ingredients.
5,What a great cookbook!,"This brings to me a new definition of comfort foods, and I find myself craving the delicious flavors and zesty blends found throughout the book. Jo Stepaniak has got to be some kind of culinary wizard to be able to combine everyday ingredients into such wonderful and tasty sauces, soups, and spreads from appetizers to main dishes to decadent desserts. That these rich and creamy dishes contain no dairy would be hard for some people to believe, but after one bite, they wouldn't care anyway! Some of my favorite recipes from the Ultimate Uncheese cookbook include Crock Cheez (hands down VERY favorite), Philly Potato Chowder (wow!), Cheez Wiz Sauce (good on EVERYTHING), Baked Macaroni and Cheez, and Nacho Cheez Sauce (try this on baked potatoes!). I highly recommend you buy this book, you will be so happy you did!"
4,Great book!,"OH MAN! SO MANY CHEESE RECIPES!!! This book is great. I think my only complaint would be that some of the recipes are a bit too simple. For example, the Fettuccine Alfonzo calls for onion powder (and no garlic?!?) instead of real onions. Why not just saute some onions in the pan first? Dunno. Either way, because of their simplicity all the recipes are easily modifiable to use REAL ingredients. Great book all around. BUY IT!"
4,Satisfaction!,"As a vegan, I find I miss cheese more than meat. This book provides yummy cheezy options with mostly common ingredients."
2,don't buy the kindle version of the book,The formatting just does not work with the kindle version of this book. Many of the measurments and other important content get cut out.
5,uncheese book,"this is a fantastic book, I was anxious to receive it, it came as described in great condition and I have been able to use the delicious receipies right from the start, I was very satisfied"
1,might as well chow down on dog food!,"OH MY GOD are these disgusting! I tried gooey grilled cheese...it tastes like warm playdough. I tried the mac and cheese....ARGGHHHH ...like I threw up in my mouth. I like the taste of nutritional yeast but this was nothing like cheese and everything like a mess of mashed beans and yeast. EWWWWWWWW. I wanted to like this book so much...i read the reviews...I was pre-pared for it to taste not like cheese but at least good. These flavors are an absolute abomination to tastebuds everywhere. Her other cookbooks are sooooo good. But this thing is a nasty nasty flop. (Two exceptions to be fair: my two smallest children do however, practically live off of the crock cheez and the pimento block cheese)"
1,bizzarre!!!,"I'm not sure what kind of ""real dairy cheese"" these reviewers are used to eating that they are comparing these recipes to. I have tried several recipes and they are NOTHING like dairy cheese. We use the nacho dip recipe for mac and cheese but all the others that we've tried have been bland, not tasted like cheese, and/or been gross. The block cheese sort of gets the texture but the 2 we tried were nasty! And my husband eats most anything! I miss real cheese and this book didn't really help."
2,Bad nutritional info,"I've had this book for a few years now; there are a couple of recipes I've tried and liked, but my family did not. Recently I was looking through it, deciding whether to give it to the used book store or not. I noticed that the book marks the following recipes as ""Gluten Free"": Baked Stuffed Shells, Kugel, Sweet Noodle Pudding. The recipes do not call for gluten-free pasta, but for regular pasta. Those recipes are NOT gluten free. As one who has celiac disease, I would hope nobody would try to make those dishes for me! The author did not do her research on what 'gluten free"" means."
2,UnCheese,"I had been missing cheese, so I got this book. It's chock full of awesome recipes, but they just weren't right for me. I returned it, hoping that some other uncheese aficianado will love it!"
3,Uncheese Cookbook,"I truly wanted a RAW cheese preparation book -- most of these recipes one has to cook.It was my mistake. So, all in all, it is useless to me."
1,Difficult and weird,"I bought this book, but never, ever use it. The recipes are long and strange and the ones I made weren't all that. I believe in ""keep it simple, stupid."" I get better raves just sticking with tofu--saute onion, fresh garlic, mash in tofu, proceed. It looks good on the shelf but fails to satisfy."
4,A Vegan's Delight,"These recipes are amazing! In addition to being dairy free the dishes are actually quite healthy. My favorite is the UNcheesecake.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
1,Culinary abomination,"First, I would just like everyone to know that there is a lot of really great vegan food out there. None of it, however, is contained in this book. After trying a few recipes and reading the others, I was forced to hide this book to keep it from being inflicted upon me. I presume that the author hasn't had cheese in so long that she has forgotten what it tasted like. If you get this book anyway, don't try the macaroni and cheese. Just don't."
1,ugh,"I attempted some of these recipes years ago and found them gross. I tried them again years later, and they are still gross. I'm confused reading all the positive reviews....how can anyone say these stinky, slimy concoctions taste good?"
1,"This stuff tastes NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING, like cheese","So hopeful was I after reading the rave reviews that, not only did I run out and buy the book, I bought a new blender as well.If I could give this cookbook no stars, I would.I am not a vegan for health reasons, so the fact that these recipes are low in fat, etc. etc. does not interest or impress me. I want a cheese substitute that tastes and acts like cheese. The recipes in this book just don't cut it. The ""Unprocessed Cheeze Sauce"", made with boiled potato, carrot and onion, tastes like pureed potato--exactly what it is.The macaroni and cheeze is not even describable...So, if you're an ethical vegan and not concerned with fat content or preservatives, you'd be better off buying Veggie Shreds by Galaxy Foods at your local grocer. They taste great and melt like real cheese.Cheese lovers--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...DON'T BUY THIS BOOK"
2,Not what I expected,I bought this book expecting to learn about fermented cheese and meltable sliceable cheese. Many turned out to be variations of sauces that can't really be compared to cheese.
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"I was really excited to get this book, but so far I have had no success with the recipes. The things I have made just don't taste very good at all. The nutritional yeast taste is strong, and I like nutritional yeast, even when I reduce the amounts in the recipe. The taste is definitely not cheese like in anything I have tried. I was hoping for this book to help me to get over the hump and give up dairy cheese for good, but the results have been very poor so far."
3,Uncheese is right,"I was really excited to try this because I thought I would be able to make many different great cheese alternatives. Many of them tasted too much like nutritional yeast and too little like cheese for me. I'm not a big fan of any cheese alternative that uses nutritional yeast, so that could be part of my disappointment. The recipes don't taste bad, they just don't remind me of cheese. If you like nutritional yeast, you may like this book, but otherwise I would skip it."
3,Collecting dust,"I've had this cookbook for 7 years. I have tried about a dozen recipes and always had to throw out what I made. I hold onto it because I know tastes change and perhaps it will become a valuable resource. It has a section of photos that make the fake cheeses look appetizing but I have been unsuccessful in making something good. I don't like the flavor of nutritional yeast and a lot of the recipes depend on this for that ""cheezy"" flavor. Most of the recipes include ingredients that I'd have to go to the store to buy, and if I end up throwing the finished product out, well, let's just say I'm not all that motivated to keep trying. I think cheese is something that is very difficult to duplicate. I'd rather eat vegan most of the time and then if I want lasagna, I just substitute the ricotta for tofu and add real mozzarella cheese."
4,Great resource,"I really like this cookbook. I have one in 2 states. I haven't tried all the recipes but I do like the ones I've tried. It's not cheese, but it's in that family of flavors."
1,eeeww!,"If I could have given this book ""no stars,"" I would have. The recipes just sound disgusting -- so much so that I never even bothered to make one (which I know is an unfair indictment, but still says much about it). I gave it to my son's school rummage sale, and can only hope it went to a home that thought it served a purpose. Written in an inane and cutesy style, long lists of weird ingredients ... it only served to make me more depressed that I had to give up dairy products, if this was the only alternative."
5,Worth Every Penny!,"This was the first book by Joanne I ever purchased, and it turned my life around! As a new vegan, I was missing the flavor of cheese, and these simple recipes hit the spot. I've since made many vegan ""cheesecakes"" for friends with much success, as well as spreads and delicious stews that vegan and omnivore alike all love. Oh my, the hot artichoke dip and cauliflower and cheese soup recipes are worth the price of the book alone.You will not regret this purchase!"
4,Creative recipes for vegans,"I first bought the original edition of the Uncheese Cookbook about 10 years ago when I had been vegan for only a few years. I missed the taste of cheese and was intrigued by the concept of this cookbook. It took some time for my taste buds to adjust but I enjoyed many recipes such as Unprocessed Cheeze Sauce and Three Cheeze Lasagna. Returning to the new edition of this book year later, I find I appreciate it even more now that my taste buds have developed even further away from the taste of dairy cheese that I remember."
4,Uncheese Cookbook,"Great book, just what I wanted. As a vegetarian slowly making my way to becoming vegan, this text provides wonderful recipes and ideas to keep the taste of cheese in my diet. Each recipe is compared to an actual dairy cheese which makes it easy to imagine the taste and texture. Despite being printed almost 15 years ago, the recipes are still on trend. The book is American, however the ingredients are easily adapted and most can be found in Australia anyway. My new found ingredient is savoury yeast flakes! Recommended to anyone who can't or does not want to use cheese and needs inspiration in the kitchen.(Only downside was the actual appearance of the book.I would have expected it to have arrived clean, not sticky and covered in gunk which only would have required a quick wipe!)"
5,Finally! A Godsend for Vegans!,"As a vegan, cheese was the hardest thing in my diet to give up. As the book says, cheese is an American tradition, from Macaroni and Cheese at family picnics to Cheeseburgers on the grill on the Fourth of July. But, I wasn't willing to contribute to factory-farming and the decline of my health JUST to enjoy a tradition. I looked everywhere, from soy to rice to hemp to almond to tofu cheeses. All of them contained casein, a milk protein. FINALLY, I found this book! There are so many recipes not only for cheese taste-a-likes like Mozzerela, Muenster, American, etc, but also cheese dishes, like casseroles and, yes, of course, Mac 'n' Cheese. The only qualm I have is that it does use Tofu in several recipes, which I can't stand the taste of. But, that's a personal issue, and in no way affects the book's quality.Highly reccommended!!"
2,Cheese? Doesn't taste like any cheese I've ever had...,"I made the swiss cheese in this book. It did not taste anything like swiss cheese. However, my kids liked it and ate it on crackers. I made another kind, but can't recall which one...I do remember no one liked it, though. And it didn't taste like cheese. If you want REAL cheese flavor, I don't think that you will find it among these recipes, sorry."
2,The book is good the kindle formating isn't,I know this book. I had the vegan cashew uncheese from it (or maybe anouther version of it) and it is amazing.However the formatting on the kindle is so bad that the numbers and words or stuff like calories are unreadable.The bad news now is that my kindle has crashed for the first time and won't start back up. This happened before I could check if the ingredients list was legible.
1,sorry folks,"i have tried several recipes in here, as i have been a vegan for years and really miss cheese. i know it is hard to replicate cheese without the casein (milk protein) and that is why the vegan cheeses on the market are so bad.now i remember why i have avoided this cookbook for years and it has sat on the shelf. not only do the recipes not taste like cheese, but my hubby who does eat cheese wanted to [puke] after trying the last recipe.most the others we have tried were so-so. the textures were weird, and the combos of tahini, nutritional yeast, etc. used throughout were just odd.she definitely gets credit for trying so hard to come up with all the different recipes! an ""a"" for effort, but i'll stick with neither cheese nor uncheese for now."
4,VIKTER IS BACCCCKKKKKKK!,"WHAT CAN I SAY BAD ABOUT THIS WARRIOR OF SOUL,THE EXPERIMENTOR OF BROKEN BEAT SOUL INFUSION, TRACKS ARE LOT LESS RAW ,TO ME THIS TIME AROUND ,BEEN A FAN OF THIS CAT FOR AWHILE NOW AND HE KEEPS GETTING HIS STYLE DOWN TO A SCIENCE,BESURE TO SAMPLE HIS TRACKS AND LISTEN TO SOME HIS PREVIOUS MUSIC AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELF,THIS CAT IS FAR AHEAD OF HIS TIME."
5,The CD is Wow!,"The CD is great! that is Bold & Beautiful.This is my first collection of Vikter's own CD, & I have no regrets. The other Productions he worked on for other artists are also great. ...The guy has a magic touch on Music.I'd advice any music lover to get this ""Bold & Beautiful"" CD.As a Neo-Soul music fan from South Africa, I take my hat off to Vikter.Thanks Again."
5,Fantastic CD,"I LOVE this CD. It's so good I bought my 'special friend' a copy. ""For Life"" and ""Touch"" are my two favorite songs. So sensual! A definite 'makeout' CD."
5,Best Experience ever,"Absolutely beautiful choreographer, stunning video, although sometimes blurry, I guess it was because my TV is not 120hz or Plasma. this is a must have for ballet lovers, The best."
4,Etta James Love Songs,Wonderful CD with wonderful old songs. Her voice is one in a million. For some reason our CD developed a skip early on but I'm not sure if it was the quality of the CD or our fault. The price was reasonable and we haven't had trouble with any other music gotten through Amazon.
5,The Agony and the Ecstasy....,"Fantastic....it does not get better than this.... Etta can really rip when she needs to--other times she sings it softly....either way, this is great stuff....this is a good place to start if you haven't heard her yet.... Don't miss this one--great stuff...."
4,Soul Stirring,"Miss Peaches is her nick name huh? Well her music is certainly sweet. When I purchased this CD a few years ago, I was really in a bluesy state of mind and remembering feeling very mellow and encouraged when listening to Etta's very soulfoul voice. She is so intense on the song Trust in Me and sweet as ever on I Want to Be Loved. Her version of Someone to Watch over me will bring you to tears (it did for me anyway, music is my therapy!). I loved this Cd and have since purchased The Chess Box-a 3cd set of her greatests songs. Wonderful. I love Jamesetta..."
4,Little Lady Big Voice,"I had the privelege of seeing Etta James in concert this summer and purchased this CD shortly after. It's one of the most romantic CDs ever! I love listening to her earthy, strong voice. Yes, not all the songs are the best, but for the most part, I really really enjoy this CD."
5,etta james at her best,i was familiar with most of these song titles growing up but not ms james version of (love songs) what a pleasant surprise and enjoyment it gives.ms jamessets the bar high for all other singers and makes me want to be a better lyric writer. give this one a listen.n s white
5,very powerful,Etta James is one of the Greatest Vocalists Ever!this set highlights that&more.She has so much spirit&vibe.this is a solid collection of Her many Great songs.i have listen to Her for so long.Her Vocals have so much Depth&Feeling.this is a must.
4,Manga Artist's Review,"This storyline is great and it is cute. There is nothing fake and heroic about Sakura. She is wonderful as the captor/hunter of the CLOW cards. The art is beautiful, the clothes are exceptional and the characters are fully developed.I have the entire series in Chinese, the English series loses a lot in translation whereas the Asian languages are better in the conversion. However, Manga is more about the art and the plot. Not about petty mistakes in translation."
4,as advertised,"Got it today and it's just like the marketing says: soft, low-profile (thin), perfect fit, button/speaker cutouts are spot on.Cons: the part that wraps around to the front is flimsy. The xoom isn't going to fall out, I just wished it fit a bit more securely/tightly. It also tends to collect junk on the back, but I guess any rubber case is going to do that.One thing to consider is that with the case on the xoom does not properly fit onto the charging port of the (separately sold) charging dock. You can still plug the cable in to charge, but I paid $50 for the dock and it's a pain to have to take the skin off every time. This is in no way reflective of the quality of Boxwave's product, just something I failed consider when buying.Overall I'm happy with it. Boxwave if you're reading how about a combo pack of the case and screen protector?!"
5,callaway mens short sleeve pique polo,"I just received my two polos , I own many others that I have worn for years , these are of the same high quality as the one's I purchased in the golf pro shop , I highly recommend these shirts."
3,Cheap shirt with a Callaway logo,"Sure it's a Callaway shirt, but it's not really any nicer than a no name polo shirt from Target. It's the course grain cotton polo type shirt that just feels cheap in my opinion. It's not mercerized, it doesn't wick away sweat, it's just a no frills shirt. It does run small and does shrink a lot after washing. If I could have ""seen"" and felt the shirt before buying it, I would have passed."
5,Great Deal!,"My husband loves his Callaway Polo shirts. I should have bought more. Great price, great quality, great look!"
1,Waste of money! Nothing here that isn't in the documentation,This book is almost an exact duplicate of the document that is included when you download the SNMP++ package. The CD contains older versions of the source and the tools that can be also be downloaded from the site. The only reason to buy the book is if you can't get online at all. I regret having wasted my money.
2,"Good subject, but badly written.","The subject matter is good. But the writing is bad. Perhaps, the book was written very hastily. Almost every page has a mistake in it, grammatical or otherwise. The author has used too many cut and pastes when writing this book, resulting in: (1) lots of uselessly duplicated text and diagrams, and (2) lots of editing mistakes. The author has some favorite words that he uses abundantly, e.g., ""instrument"" as a verb, ""network appliance"", etc. He keeps on referring to a MIB as ""an MIB"" and many times refers to an unsigned long as ""a unsigned long"". The book is poor in explanation. Not intended for people who do not already understand SNMP."
4,Awsome Technology,"Awesome work! This technology saved me many man hours of work getting my SNMP management application to market. If you are looking for an OO / C++ based set of classes to leverage for network management, this is it."
1,Season 3 is Fake,Flav was not really looking for love; he was in love with his Baby Mama Liz the whole time. Season 3 is totally FAKE; do not buy this.
4,FLAVOR OF LOVE SEASON 3???,"It seems to be that the show is having huge rates cause it haven't end yet & there's a release date on dvd. So far the show is very good,pretty intertesting kinda hard to figure out who will win & more after SAPPHYRIE & BUCKWILD brought 4 more girls to the house. I was expecting FLAVOR FLaV to give SAPPHYRIE a second chance since she was eliminated in mid first episode on season 2, but hey, that's tv!! The elimination process so far is been the same & like I said it's kinda unpredictable but very good show!! A little difference on the previous 2 seasons. & I hope tht if thie reunion show is exposive as season 2 that the distributors don't leave that one out. I was very desappointed last time,hope I won't be desappointed this time around.Got my dvd set & as I suspect it,there was no reunion show!!! Desappointing,but hey,FLAVOR FLAV I will still your fan!!!"
3,Flavor of Love Season 3,"I have to say I'm a sucker for watching reality shows. Now although I like Flavor Flav he's not very attractive so I have a hard time believing all these women fighting for his love. How can you kiss a man who wears a grill?I'm sorry, but it's time to hang up the clock. I'm glad there aren't anymore seasons of Flavor of Love."
3,Fun Toy for grown-ups,"I honestly bought this toy for myself, and being an adult, I am not too hard on it. Although I imagine it is built well enough to withstand quite a beating. This toy is nice to sit around, but it would not be good for little ones, as it only has a few basic movements. I enjoy it immensely, but it's more of a collectible than a toy."
3,"JOHN CURRAN, OPUS 2","*** 2004. Based on Andre Dubus'sWe Don't Live Here Anymore: Three Novellas, WE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE was directed by John Curran. A prize at Sundance for the screenplay. Two friends, two couples, two sordid affairs. The film is very depressing and is only worth a look if you're interested in the problems of married couples and that's also unfortunately its limit because John Curran is not Ingmar Bergman and never manages to give a universal dimension to his script. Already forgotten."
2,"God-Awful, Marriage-Bashing, Depressing Film","In ""We Don't Live Here Anymore,"" Edith (Naomi Watts) compares being married to a gorilla in a cage eating his own sh*t. When I rented this film, I was expecting some intelligent, elegant philosophizing on suburban marriage and adult friendship among married couples.This film has nothing intelligent to say. It only serves to depress. It makes a strong anti-marriage statement. None of the positives of marriage are discussed - only children are shown to be a light in an otherwise bleak institution.If not for the superb acting of Laura Dern and Mark Ruffalo, this movie would have received one star from this reviewer."
1,Terminally Uninteresting Meets Who Cares,"So you have this terminally uninteresting individual, really, TERMINALLY UNINTERESTING, and you multiply him times four. Then you put these four in a situation where their boring problems become yours because, after all, you, you simp, paid for this DVD. Their marriages have become abysmally stale (no surprise there), but they are all too guilt ridden to avail themselves of the obvious solution which is to enjoy their affairs with each other's spouses and shut up. Once the secret is out about their respective infidelities everyone goes away mad and returns to the 1950s.And so we are left with Hollywood's version of a morality tale.This crowd really makes you yearn for Mae West and Errol Flynn."
1,Over Acting for Beginners,More bad acting and false passion than any human can stand. If you can empathise with any of these characters see a doctor.
2,The Machiavellic art of cruelty to your spouse - Depressing,"The acting is flawless and the quality of the movie is beyond reproach. However, the story itself is without aim or reason. The essence of this movie is this: four adults acting like immature, shallow, pleasure-seeking puppets at the mercy of their unexamined fears and desires, in front of their children who register everything they see like it were gospel.If you are a real adult, do not waste your time and money on this movie."
4,portrays powerfully,"There is a visceral quality to this story, spellbinding and heart-wrenching. It captivated me, and though painful to watch, the movie stayed with me for days afterwards. Two couples that are friends, with marriages in crisis, must face the growing despair of their infidelities, unrealized ambitions, and complacency at home. The performances of the lead characters were done incredibly well, especially Laura Dern.The reviews of this movie stretch across the board, but everyone seems to have a lot to say about this film. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's well worth watching."
2,not one of the best,I may have read too many books on Alzheimer's but this book was not as encouraging or as informative and many of the others I have read.
4,Thank God there is help,Without this book my wife and I would not have survived my Mother in law last few years.
4,Wonderful entertainment,Kept me awake to the wee hours--thank God I am retired !1 I want more mysteries like this.
4,Another fun read from Monica Ferris,"This one leaves you guessing to the end. As usual, her characters are like old friends you never get tired of visiting. A little heavy handed on needlework details but not enough to bore; still a good read."
4,Pretty good read,"Not one you can't lay down, but a pretty good story. I liked the characters and tho I'm not a x-stitcher it was fiber related. I'll probably read others by her. I wonder if she's going to write a spinning theme? Butchery at the Black Sheep Gathering?"
2,Very little new material,"My 2-year-old doesn't like the repackaged Sesame Street material that makes up so many of these Elmo videos (the exception being Elmo's World, which she loves). So, videos with 5 or 10 minutes of new material and then lots of old Sesame Street stuff makes her more whiny than happy. This video falls into that category. I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because she does like the Elmos World part. Instead of this, I recommend Abby in Wonderland which is FANTASTIC."
4,My daughter loves it!,"The 4 star is not due to quality, but due to the fact that one mom can only watch so much Sesame Street! Cute show as always. Great learning experience"
1,Plastic -yuk - Bronco glasses,"I may not have read the description accurately, but I did not know these glasses were plastic until they arrived. Very disappointing and over priced."
4,CAUTION,"This is a very cute toy. Only thing...I paid $9.99 for shipping and handleing and when it arrived at my house, the toy was not in a brown box, the company just stuck a shipping sticker on the toys box. When it arrived, my 4 year old twins got an early Christmas present...it was on my portch! Not much for Christmas presents this year and now I am one less! THANKS ALOT!!!"
4,Broke too soon!,"My two boys had lots of fun with this toy, but it only lasted about 2 months before the stand broke completely off. I'd have hoped for it to last longer! We've tried 3 other kinds since, none seem durable enough for youngsters..."
4,The Next T Ball Star,My son's god parents bought this item and ever since his godfather (Saul) thought him once how to place the ball on top and hit it. Every day we have to play bat and ball. I think this was the best gift you can give a boy. My son is only 16months and knew exactly what to do. I would recommend this toy to anyone.
4,Good and simple,A good basic t-ball stand. Nothing fancy. Nothing electronic. And it can be hung on the wall!
4,Great toy,I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he really likes it. It is pretty sturdy because the grown ups have taken a few whacks at it and it has not cracked. I would recommend it for small children.
4,Great Fun,My Son Loves this T-Ball Set. It is very durable and easy to store. Teaches Good Hand Eye cordination.
4,geat toy!!!,My son absolutely loves this t-ball set. It is very durable and can be beat to death. He has improved greatly on his hand eye coordination. We bought this for him when he was 15 months old and he has been playing with it ever since. It is easily stored too. I definately recommend!
4,TBall set,Easy to put together...but after a few swings he looses interest in it...but he is very eager to get outside to take those few swings...so he is still interested in the toy after a few weeks....
5,Perhaps the greatest contribution to HJ criticism in the last 30 years,This book contains prof. Bell's masterful readings of some of HJ's greatest works. Easy to read and yet so profound and inspiring. A masterpiece.
4,A personal touch to war,"""The Crazy Iris"" edited by Kenzaburo Oe is a collection of stories about the dropping the atomic bombs. These stories are not from a historical context or from a military standpoint, but of normal, relatable people. The stories cover the carnage seen through the eyes of a twelve year old to the memories of women going back thirty years to the high school they once attended. It also covers how the outlying villages were indirectly affected by the bombing through word of mouth and deaths of friends and families."
5,Don't Listen to A.B.C.D. Reader!,"I'm writing this just to offer the opinion that A.B.C.D.'s review is biased (at best) and ultra-nationalist and revisionist (at worst).Read this book and judge it for yourself. The various stories recount life in militarist Japan, horrifying scenes of atomic aftermath, and the desperate psychological and spiritual struggle to cope with the trauma of survival. This collection is a moving testament to its authors' experiences, but to say that it explicitly is anti-war or blames anyone for the atomic blast would not reflect the entirety of the book. The viewpoints and opinions of the authors are as varied as those of the Japanese themselves."
4,"Great information, maps and tables would be good","The information presented in the book is exactly what you would expect - it is a thorough history of the promotion of rails and canals by government. ""Government"" is meant in a general sense: the author tracks promotion by municipal, state, and federal government.However, following the information and comparing it state by state would have been made a lot easier had there been more than one map. The only map in the book is located at the front to illustrate Gallatin's findings. As Goodrich delves into the details, and as the tale progresses past the Alleghenies, the map is nearly useless. Unless you have memorized all of the towns, rivers, and mountains of the Eastern Seaboard, you may have to resort to another resource. Also, it would have been nice to have the data tabulated geographically and/or chronologically for ease of comparison."
5,Big fan,"I love Abby Payne's voice and songs -- it's rare to see a young musician who sings, plays and writes this beautifully. This album is great, and her new album, 'In a Pretty Box' is even better. Her song 'Green' on 'In a Pretty Box' is my favorite, and she recently released a video on Youtube for it -- touching, quirky and fantastic. Love it!"
3,A Sound Grip; for 2 weeks.,"I used this for quite awhile, that is, until it started to go dull. After about 2 weeks, the audio stopped playing loudly, instead, it started to run badly when positioned wrong at times. The part where the wire gets out at had to be adjusted manually to get sound, otherwise it would get lower again... So yeah, it died on me. It produced quite a loud and fair sound but it sounded so raw, but loud, much more louder than the NDS itself."
4,defintely makes it louder.,"definitely makes the DS louder. it would be nice if it had a separate volume control, but you can't seem to get fine enough granularity with just the volume control on the DS. also, don't expect super great fidelity, it just makes it so the sound is louder, which allows your kid to keep the game screen farther away from their face."
4,Excellent!,Muy buenos lentes polarizados y excelente calidad de vision. Buen precio y la calidad de la marca es evidente. Recomendados 100%.
2,Dosen't work in Littermaid automatic cat box,The bag was shipped inside a cardboard box and when it arrived the catlitter bag had broke open. I was able to salvage the contents. We used it in a Littermaid automatic litterbox but this litter dosen't clump as well as other brands. It might be OK for other boxes but it didn't work for us.
4,"This is some good stuff, but....","...cat litter is something that a cat owner needs again and again. This is a great product and we deserve the ""subscription"" option. It would be so nice to have a bag of this show up every month or so."
2,Leaky bag,This litter works fine but the bag was leaking all over the place when it arrived; needs to be packaged better.
3,Really poor odor control.,"I'm not used to using expensive litter - my go-to is the cheapest PetSmart option, ""Precious Cat"" - but this stuff is too cheapo for me. The smell is awful. I've been cleaning my cat's box every day, and it still stinks up half the house. Plus, the tracking issues aren't noticeably better or worse than with Precious Cat. As soon as I use this up, I'm going back to my usual brand."
5,NEVER RECEIVED IT,"I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM, BUT NOT BECAUSE OF AMAZON- THEY REORDERED IT 3 TIMES AND CREDITED ME MONEY FOR MY TROUBLES. FINALLY AFTER 3 TRIES, AMAZON CREDITED THE MONEY BACK TO MY ACCOUNT."
3,Don't try this with arthritis,"This is probably a good video for someone with normal hips. But I have osteoarthritis in my hips.You will be very sore if your doctor told you, you have ""severe or fairly severe"" arthritis.I used it with the aquafins. I had to use a cane for 1/2 hour after using this video.Don't try this at home (with these caveats). I'm sure for twenty or thirty-somethings, this would work, but if you have severe or fairly severe arthritis problems, its too much.HTH"
5,tMG's on vinyl,"Really there is not much more to say then I have already stated on other reviews of Mountain Goats records.Once you listen to tMG's live or on record, there is really no going back. The mp3's just do not cut it anymore.If you love this album, then the record is really the only medium left to hear it in all of it's brilliance. If you are new to tMG's and have not heard this album, you may or may not like it. It is sort of a debatable album amongst fans. The truth of it is that it takes a few listens to really grow on you, but after awhile, some of the songs just get stuck in your head, but not in a bad way.Worth every penny."
4,Weird!,I never thought that this was really possible! They show this guy jumping off a building and right before he lands he...You have to buy it to find out! Amazing!
4,Pretty darn good...,"...the cover come on, I could not say no to that. Well it is about three tales that end up being linked to one story. There's a story about a zombie, one about an alien, and another about a brain. They are all interesting and the way they linked them was interesting too. I didn't find myself bored with this one at all, it has a little bit of everything. Well done. I would recommend this one."
2,not as manufacturer describes,"I bought this Barbie after seeing two pictures of angel Barbies on the website and reading the Manufacturer's Description. One picture seems to have been deleted now. The Manufacturer's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash. I trusted that the Manufacturer's description, which matched one of the pictures, was the correct angel. The doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all. It is very simple with vinyl wings. Be aware of which you are purchasing, the description is deceptive and incorrect."
5,Holiday Angel Barbie Doll,The girls liked this doll. The wings are velcro so they can make her into a princess or play with her as an angel- they like that. Great buy from Amazon.
3,Angel Barbie is not as lustrous as most,"Angel Barbie is okay, my daughter plays w/ her, but she doesn't have the same glam or luster about her that some of the other Barbies have."
2,A pretty awful book,"I'm an avid fantasy fan, loving the drek and the great stuff both. This was so awful, so boring, so tedious that I had to stop reading it - it just didn't go. Whether it's a poor translation or is fundamentally broken, I dunno, but it's not worth bothering with."
2,Blips and beeps for bucks,2 1/2Besides for the first and second to last tracks there doesn't seem to be a whole lot worth savoring or saving on this disposable disc.
5,A Short Album That Needs Time,"""Iambic 5 Poetry"" is sheer beauty. It IS the standout track, and at first I thought it was going to be the only one. This mini-album takes several listens to get engrossed and to appreciate all that it offers. At this stage, I can say that I'm thoroughly satisfied with this album. It uses some of the more accoustic jazz style of Music Is Rotted One Note, but this time it's less dark in tone. In fact, it's rather uplifting. There is more electronic sequencing involved here, but it is quite subtle in its execution.The aforementioned track is the big melody track. Others are more experimental and free-form in nature, but easy to enjoy and complement the overall feel of the mini-album."
3,Is the vein of 'Music is Rotted One Note' tapped?,"Very much akin to Mr. Jenkinson's last dive into acid jazz fusion, 'Music is Rotted One Note', Squarepusher has yet again returned to the seemingly lo-fi jazz statement against drum n bass in 'Budakhan Mindphone'. The last album was hailed as genius by some and a triffle by others, and this mini album will definitely garner the same reviews by critics: divided. Though some of this disc does delve back into the world of drum n bass for short sections, some of the songs get monotonous and weighed down by the jazz touch (the final song 'Gong Acid' for instance is a trail of percussion hits). My personal favorite track on here is 'Two Bass Hit'. If you enjoyed Jenkinson's last excursion, then this is the disc for you and if this is your first time listening to Squarepusher's latest material, this may be a cheap sampler to his full length release."
4,mellow jungle,"This disc is more experimental than Tom's other albums. At times it reminds me of some dreamy organic free jazz, as opposed to the digital cyberjungle heard on Selection Sixteen. Tom's bass playing is quite a strong presence on this album as well, which isfun because he has chops like no other."
5,Excellent Liason; As exhilarating as a full album,"In a fit of uncontrollable anxiety, I bought this CD on the day it came out in March, and was most certainly NOT disappointed. The opening track was a flowing introduction to the staccato second, and the rest followed delightfully. Slightly more down-to-earth instrumentally than its predecessor, Budakhan Mindphone is a must-have for the true jazz-tech fiend."
2,Not too tasty.,I was not impressed with this product. It was not very flavorful and what taste it did have was reminiscent of cardboard. The minestrone flavor is much better.
2,Too Salty!,The flavor of this dried soup was good and the idea of combining three onions in one soup is novel. But...the soup was waaaaay too salty and this would keep me from purchasing it again.
1,Totally Tasteless,"I wish I can say that this soup cup tastes bad, because even bad taste is taste, but I can't. It is totally tasteless. I coped by adding my own seasoning: garlic salt, Tabasco sauce, sesame oil, etc. The tasteless soup looks like muddy water and the portion of noodles is small, about 3/4 of what I got in a Ramen noodle soup cup, at twice of the price of Ramen. I don't think I will buy this product ever again."
5,Un libro único,Esta es una de las mejores novelas históricas que se han escrito nunca sobre la conquista de América. La he leído varias veces y siempre encuentro aspectos novedosos en cada lectura.
2,I need it in English and it was in Spanish,"I loved this book, I read it a long time ago. The thing is that in Amazon says that it was in english, as a matter of fact, I buy it as a present; and SURPRISE, It was in Spanish so I don't need it anymore.The book is good, the description they give me in amazon was poor."
5,Nice features,"Getting the three bases is great. One for the router table, and then having the plunge and d-handle for hand work is great.Soft-start makes it easier to control when starting, no more jerking when starting. Variable speed controller another nice feature when working with easily burned woods.This was the perfect replacement for my DW610. As with most tools, its only as good as the cutting bit/blade/knife. Stay away from the cheapo HSS bits. I stick with carbide tipped, anti-kickback bit with 1/2"" shank whenever possible and have always had excellent results."
5,This package is a winner!,"When I was shopping for a new router I liked the DeWalt multi base package. It offers a Plunge base that is really easy to use. I've used the standard base two times this week arready. Each base can be changed in about 30 seconds. The router itself is really easy to set up and changing bits is a breeze. I also use the router moter with my EzLift router plate on my router table. Don't blink twice, this is a killer product! Buy it!"
4,plasticky feel but performs better than Bosch,Had the Bosch 1617 before this and it was a lot noiser and kicked more on startup than this. Very smooth.Now if Dewalt could only figure out how to make it less plasticky feeling...
3,"Good but not Great, Buy good bits","Ok, so I bought this after reading all the reviews. I've returned one and got another. In both cases I had a collet break. DO NOT USE CHEAP ROUTER BITS! I have determined this cased the breakage. The 1/4"" broke using a Bosch bit. I noticed as I was putting in the bit it was tight, where as the Amana bit fit smoothly and the same for the Whiteside. Also I use a wrench for tightening instead of the push in. I feel I can get a better tightening of the bit using two wrenches.It accepts Porter Cable (PC) stuff so that' a plus, but if I had to do it again I think I would spend more and get a PC. Good news is PC service department seems to be great, I have another collet on it's way."
3,Missing parts from kit,"As another reviewer has experienced, there are some kits out therewith missing parts.My kit also missed both collets, centering guide, wrench, and dust hose adapter!Update: Got the kit replaced with another one that was OK.The kit itself I have found to be very good, so it could be close to 5 stars really..."
3,DW618B3,"I received this product quickly from Amazon. Upon inspection, I found the plastic sub bases on all three bases to be badly warped. The bases were unable to sit flat on a board. I checked the base foundation castings on a surface plate and found them to be reasonably flat ( +- .002 ). Called Dewalt and spoke to customer service, expecting them to ship out replacement sub bases, but they said to return the unitAmazon shipped out the replacement unit and was received in two days. Two of the three bases were warped again. Called Dewalt, and was told to return the item. Dewalt does not care about customer's time or effort, Their quality control is very poor,and they ignore the possibility of a manufacturing defect. I am saddened by this, since I have been very happy with their older products.P.S. - the bases can be flattened by sanding on a surface plate, table saw top, or plate glass, but the customer should not have to do this with a new product. Tha rest of the router is Good"
1,Serious design flaw!,"The second time I used the router (in 2 years, I'm not much of a woodworker) the magnetic ring that controls the varispeed feature shattered into ~16 pieces that I fished out of the motor and it won't run anymore. Some pieces must still be in the motor since if I spin the tip after turning it on it will start spinning, but stutters never reaching full speed. This will be the last Dewalt product I purchase sadly since much of my tool collection is yellow."
4,Forget the Story; Enjoy the Dancing!,"In order to enjoy this DVD just listen to the wonderful Tchaikovsky music, enjoy the dancing and forget the story. Oliver Matz as Drosselmeyer steals the show as more or less a Master of Ceremonies and dances oustandingly as he entertains the guests at the ball with the traditional divertissements done with flair. Vladimir Malakhov in a minor role as the Nutcracker Prince has a couple of solos and pas de deux with Saidakova climaxing with the traditional Nutcracker pas de deux. The audience seemed to love the ballet."
2,Drossylmeyer's Nutcracker,"If Malakhov knew how little he would be dancing, he would have taken the role of Drossylmeyer.This is the most ill conceived and cheaply produced Nutcracker I have ever seen. The score while beautifully played is totally re aranged. I spent most of my time trying to remember what was usually danced to what. Definitely fast forward to Act II"
3,Looked Cheap,"Although the book is hard cover, the pages inside look and feel like paperback. This book looks cheap, compared to the first book, Inkheart, which i bought in a book store instead of online."
4,Inkspell Casts Its Magic,"After reading all the Harry Potter books, and loving all but the last, I was not easily won over. However, Cornelia Funke's INKHEART and now INKSPELL have made devoted fans of my 14-year old daughter and myself. INKSPELL has excitement, complex characters, and thrilling plot twists. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages."
3,Terrible reader,"I listen to lots of audiobooks, and I have gotten used to various styles of readers. Jim Dale reading the Harry Potter series set the standard. Lynn Redgrave did a wonderful job reading ""Inkheart"", the first book in this series. Brendan Fraser treats his reading of the second book, ""Inkspell"" like he's a character in an animated movie. He screeches and shouts. He does absurd accents from all over the world for the characters. He changes pace trying to match the action. It is distracting and detracts from the story. It is so annoying I have frequently turned it off even though the story is very interesting. His voice gets so loud that I can't use my earbuds when listening.I gave the review three stars because the story is so good. I'm sure I would have given the book five stars but since I am reviewing the audiobook, I probably should have only given it one star - that's how bad the reading is."
1,Audio Edition: Brendon Frasier does a really bad job as narrator,"Listened to to Inkheart and loved the book...Redgrave does a fantastic job as the narrator. Unfortunately, Frasier does not!! Could not finish this one. Shame on the publishers for not contracting with Redgrave again."
5,A Worthy Successor To Inkheart,"Meggie. Mo, Dustfinger, and Farid return, and for some the return is to the land the characters sprang from in Inkheart. Clever to the point of confusion, there are warring princes, fire giving fairies, and pet grizzly bears to contend with as well as a vengeful Mother out to destroy her son's killer. Three quarters of the way through I had no idea how this was all going to wrap up, and the answers are surely still out there since the book ends in less a cliff hanger and more a simple stop. Extremely engaging as the first book was, and a must for any young person or adult who believes in the power and the magic of the written word."
3,A word of caution,"Cornelia Funke is a truly talented writer. The power and beauty with which she paints her scenes is spell-binding. But Inkspell may not be what you expect. This is very much an adult's book disguised as children's literature. Those who have read Inkheart will possibly remember that there was some profanity scattered throughout the text. In this new book, the explicatives have been sown with a much heavier hand, so much so that, for me, they detracted from the beauty of the story. Even without regard to the profanity, much of the subject matter in this book is better suited for an older audience. Please use discretion when buying this book for a young child; you may wish to read through it first yourself."
5,agreat new saga,"I was expecting a much worse copy of harry potter's books and I was really surprised when I discovered this books are even more interesting and, by far, much better written. I could say they are more adults although still full of imagination."
5,BEST BOOK EVER,"This was a really great book. It was fun, entertaining and its long so it dosen't end quickly. Highly recommended but to read this book and understand it you would have to read Inkheart."
2,"Great book, terrible reading","What happened to Lynn Redgrave? Brandon Frasier is a terrible reader, simply incomphrehensible. I was driving from Boston to New Hampshire and tossed to the first CD into the back seat. I so disgusted listening to him bumble his way through making up accents, stumbling over the language and dialogue. He is truly an awful reader, what was Listening LIbrary thinking? And he is to star in the film Inkheart? Let's hope he is a better actor than reader.I know this is a delightful book, and I was enchanted by the first audiobook, it is terrible that this series is marred by this audiobook. I hope listening library brings back Lynn Redgrave for the third book in the series."
5,Perfect as a sequel!,"This book is a really good sequel. It tells about how Meggie and Farid go into the Inkworld. Farid falls in love with Meggie, and there are a couple of kissing scenes. All in all, perfect! I can't wait for Inkdawn and Inkheart's movie to come out!--A Horse-crazy Doll-crazy Book-crazy 11-year-old"
1,Not Quite What You Think It Would Be,"Anyone who read the book Inkheart by Cornelia Funke would know that a sequel would be hard because of the impression that Inkheart left upon the people that read it. Inkspell does not have the same emotion and feeling that Inkheart had. The book is somewhat dry compared to the first book. In this book, the characters that are introduced are not as developed as the other book. Overall, if you are looking for a good, long book for your children that would keep them entertained Inkheart is the one to chose, but if they have read it before, I suggest that you do not go for the book of Inkspell. It did not keep my attention and often I would find myself un happy with the book because of the boring writing."
4,Inkspell rules,Inkspell is ALOT BETTER than Inkheart. I think Inkspell is 4 star and Inkheart 3. I hope the next book is better! Hooray for Meggie and Dustfinger.Dustfinger fans- Warning this book will be SAD! If you feel sad for for Dustfinger feel sad for Farid too.
2,Too many details....,"Half the page was details and I got very bored.Decent plotline until the middle, then the storywas destroyed by details.The first book was OKAY, not great, but I expected more from the sequel."
3,A slow read...,"This was an interesting and original story, however reading it took a long time. It just didn't quite grab me."
3,the end ...what ? uh no what ??,this book great it's very good and simple and it's good for kids and adults alike ...but the end wasn't complete i feel like there well be a sequel though i think this story shouldn't be a 3 books trilogy ...righti mean this story had to be a simple trilogy of 2 books no more there's no point of making 3 books and that's the part that made feel anoyed really i just think that there's nothing left to writeso i am sure that the 3rd book well be dump...
3,The 2nd,"This book Inkspell is the second in the trilogy of Ink, Now the only problem with this book is th writing.Cornelia Funke Seperates the characters making hard to understand ,Also to much romance and the part where they talk in the room with RosenQuarts was not needed ,This book was the worst so far."
2,Not a good sequel,"I had read Inkblood and enjoyed it, and of course was interested in Inkspell. However, I was rather disappointed because SPOILER ALERT the plot wound on and became more implausible and impossible, so to ""fix"" it, or make the plot work (make that to TRY to make the plot work) more and more people can suddenly make things happen by reading and writing. Ie, to resolve conflict and crises, we get someone to read something, or someone to write something...and there was even one point (re the reading of the magic book) where it seemed to me something worked out outside the way the story itself specified as possible (maybe I'm wrong). Also, the way it ends you get the impression its deliberately made to drag on and on...it brings no closure at all and yet there's no feeling of ""good, it goes on"". If you find it in the library, it would maybe be worth a quick read, but I wouldn't buy it."
5,Inkheart!!!!!!!!!!,"Inkheart is the best book I've ever read!!! I can relate to so many of the characters thoughts and actions! I used Inkheart to escape from my present world, and go somewhere beautiful and mind blowing. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age. I love this book, and I know you will, too!Katrina, age 12"
5,Inkspell,I absolutely love this book. Enough happened in it to get me through a three hour car-ride. I finished right when we arrived in Cape May. The ending drove me absolutely crazy and I really can't wait until the third book comes out.
4,Inkspell could have done without the profanity...,I enjoyed reading Inkheart then continued with the sequel Inkspell. I was surprised to find adult profanity used quite a bit in the sequel Inkspell for it to be a children's book. I feel it could have done without the profanity. As with that adult language in it - it cannot be used in Elementary school libraries. So students that read Inkheart will not be able to get the sequel in school due to the adult language.
5,A spell comes from the heart,"A ""must read"" sequel to InkHeart. Where Meggie gets wisked away to the InkWorld. The romance, action, magic, and a little troble making make this book a must read. Though for the very sad ending...but I wouldn't want to give it away. These two books are so well written it's no surprise of Inkheart becoming a movie. If you loved InkHeart there is no dought you'll love it's captivating sequel, InkSpell."
2,It leaves you hanging,We liked Inkheart. Inkspell does not end well. It seems like Funke did not try to finish the book - so that she could write another one.
2,Very dry and too many details,"This book was incredibly dry and I had a difficult time getting through it. I would have abandoned it halfway through, but I had already committed 300 pages. The book was way too long and started to become ridiculous by the end. The first book, Inkheart, was written in good taste, but Inkspell was very poorly written. I just wanted to say get on with it and let me finish the book. I understand there are more books to come, but they could have made an ending on the book. I guarantee I will not be reading the next one. I'm grateful to be done with this book and move on to bigger and better things."
1,Don't waste your $13.59!!!,"Long, boring, pathetic. How much worse can it get? Seriously people, it is a total drag. Spend your money on a good book, like Frindle, or The Laundry News. Take my advice!!!!!!!!!!!!Even if you have read Inkheart, it still is bad."
3,"A good sequel, but too long and sometimes boring","I bought this book because I've read Inkheart and when I heard there was a sequel I just had to buy it.Inkspell is not as good as the first book. Yes, it has a lot of adventure, yes it has interesting characters and the way Cornelia describes things is amazing, but the book is too long and while I was reading it I felt that lots of things didn't need to be there, and 600 pages could easily have become 250 making this a greater book.It took me 2 and a half months to finish it, I couldn't read more than 2 chapters a day and it looked like I had more remaining pages everyday!I love the idea of the book, about people reading other people in and out a story and adventures, fights, etc but it was so long and it became boring sometimes..."
4,Ink heart fan :),"I really like this story, but was a bit disappointed to see the amount of bad language in the book. While I did enjoy reading it I thought this one was a littler harder to follow with so much going on at the same time. I was disappointed at the end to just be left hanging. It leaves you no choice but to have to read the last book to get any type of closure. Which I had intended to do anyway, still I just don't like to be left hanging. But over all I love the story idea, the characters and the writers style. I'm ready to start Ink Death right now! :)"
5,Previous,"U need to read INKHEART (the first book) first or you'll be like, ""What just happened??!!"" But If u did, it's awesome."
3,Inkspell By Cornelia Funke,"I would recommend this book to people old enough to handle the graphic descriptions, all the swearing, and if you have read the previous book, Inkheart. When there is violence between the characters (ex. wounds, killing, etc.) it is described so vividly that you can see the picture in your mind and never get it out of your head. The parts with Meggie and Farid are cute but I wish Fenoglio was not there being so parental. The first time I tried reading Inkspell I only made it half way through because I lost interest but I tried reading it again and I made it through. I thought Inkheart was written better and made me want to know what happens next. The beginning of Inkspell gets you engaged and the ending of Inkspell makes you want to read the next book but the middle was kind of slow. The ending was kind of disappointing because of a certain death. After reading this world I am grateful for where I live because I would not want to be in the Folcharts' shoes."
4,Excellent reading by Brendan Fraser,"This is the second audio production by Brendan Fraser my son and I have listened to, and both reveal him to be an exceptional reader. He uses appropriate, not over-the-top expressiveness, gives characters discernible voices, and above all, avoids the horrible sing-songy, condescending voice that way too many readers of juvenile fiction seem compelled to adopt. I sincerely hope he continues to make audio CD's."
3,Good but a little too long,This was an entertaining book but I think it was a little too long and drawn out. Am glad I purchased and read it.
5,Best Book I ever read,"Knowing some of Funke's other work, I bought this book (and Inkheart) for my hard to buy for nephew, who is 11. He read both books in under 3 days and sent me a thank you note stating ""These are the best books I've ever read!"". I'm now in the 'cool aunt' category! I may even ask to read them myself with recomendations like that!"
5,beautiful work,"this book is captivating and enchanting with great descriptions-a stunning read.it really makes you think about its contents. the components are perfect with happiness, romance and tearjerking saddness well combined to fill out the book.by the way i think the farid/meggie romance(not maggie,as some seem to think) is charming. it adds a much needed lightness to the book and spices up the otherwise rather bland and predictable charachter of meggie( meggie and farid are 13 and 15 by the way, not 10 and 8 as someone seemed to think). the charachter expansion is great and i cant wait for the next book!!!!"
4,I put a spell on you....,"The beginning was tedious but the book turned out to be a worthwhile read. The end wasn't a page turner, it was a page burner.. I can't believe how fast I read this book and how much I enjoyed it after I got through the beginning. The plot thickens & develops with all the twists and turns that make Funke an amazing author. Her characters are just that. She brings dimension to them so much that you feel as though you know them, they aren't simply black & white on a page."
3,Two and a half stars,"Overall Corneilia Funke had alot going for her. There was an excellent plot and lots of ideas to dwell on, however Corneilia Funke lost grip on her story.First off there is the ending. I actually enjoy the idea of a tragic ending but Funke made it a confusing mess. Characters who should have died (Mo) live (just because she loves them too much) and characters who should have lived (Dustfinger) randomly die. Fengolio just arrogantly brushed off the chaotic state of inkworld.Then there was the constant repitition. The same facts are continously repeated.The worst part is the romance between Farid and Meggie. In the beginning of the book Corneilia asks to a friend if she talked enough about Meggie and Farid. Yes, Corneilia did to the extent of being annoying. The romance between Meggie and Farid should only take up a chapter or so but instead it takes up a fourth of the book.The book has many good ideas but Corneilia Funke is unable to put them in an enjoyable and coherant order."
1,Audiobook: Inkspell,"The book is great, no mistake about it. Inkheart's audiobook was so wonderful that perhaps there's no way Brendan Fraser could possibly live up to the standard set. That said, however, his voice was flat in narration, and his voices for the characters were cheesily accented so that Farid sounded Russian (or ?) and Dustfinger had a vaguely Celtic accent, which was distracting to the story. My daughter and I also found that he lacked any subtley or depth of emotion--so that, for example, his reading of Fenolio's angst came off as merely surly. I'm glad to see that Fraser wasn't booked for the third installment, and immensly disappointed that he will play Mo in the movie . . . But more to the point, I'm really sorry I bougth this audiobook version of Inkspell. Read the book. You'll be much happier!"
5,A Magical Adventure in the Inkworld,"Inkspell, by Cornelia Funke, is a captivating fantasy sequel to Inkheart. As in Inkheart, Meggie and her father have the ability to read living things out of books. Meggie reads herself and her friend Farid into the world of Inkheart, the ""Inkworld"" as she calls it. They find that the story has changed from the original plot and must save the citizens from the evil ruler: the Adderhead. While reading Inkspell, I truly connected with the characters and felt their fear or awe.The fascinating world of Inkspell would entice anyone ages ten and above. There is a lot of suspense and action to read about; however, there is some violence involved. It seems to me that Funke ended Inkspell kind of quickly. I understand that there is another book in the trilogy, but she could've wrapped it up a bit better. As a seventh grader I highly recommend Inkspell to children and adults who are seeking a magical adventure."
5,Great Book,"I just finished this book about 10 min ago and it was fabulous. I was a little upset however by the way the book ended. I was so close to crying and one specific part. During this book I wanted to laugh sometimes, cry sometimes, and even smack some people too. :) However no matter what emotion I was feeling it always was soooooo....oooo hard to put the book down. It you are looking for a book that will just take you in pick up Inkspell you will LOVE IT.MAR"
3,"Great storyline, but too long","The storyline is great, but just like the first one to this series, Inkheart, it is way too long. Once again, I felt myself wanting to skim through this book instead of reading it in whole. I had to keep referring back to the beginning where she describes the characters because I kept forgetting who they all were. I don't know for sure if that was because there were just too many characters or if it was because I was just reading the story for something to do and because I wanted to get it over with. I felt awkward with Meggie kissing Farid and talking about marriage when she is like 13. The ending also left it off to where you know there is going to be another one, and I just groaned. Although I will read it whenever it comes out, I do not hold much hope for it."
5,5th Grade Student,"I loved this book even better than the story before it, Inkheart! It's recommendation for people around my age group, especially if you like fantasy/action/adventure. This book kept me in suspense almost the entire time; I never wanted to stop reading, which is very rare for me. Probably the only other book that made me feel like that was Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It throws in a little romance, but even if you're a boy you wouldn't mind, because the rest of the book is a suspenseful, exciting adventure in a fantasy world!"
2,"Audio Reader Stinks, What a Shame","After hearing Lynn Redgrave read Inkheart, I was so eager for more, but Brendan Fraser, the reader, is so concentrated on his different accents and shallow interpretation that I can only listen for a bit without shaking my head and wondering why they hired him for the reading. He gets in the way of the story. Someone in the Marketing Department must have thought he was good, what a pity. I'd rather have a bland reader and then at least I could use my own imagination. There is no maturity and not much warmth in his voice. I hope someone else reads it someday. Better read it in book form, I say. Best of Luck to You All and Happy Audio Experiences!!"
5,Second Review for Angel Light Ring,"I reviewed this item shortly I received it, and was disappointed because chemicals in the pool seemed to turn the Angel ring black... Well, I must say that after some time, the ""black"" disappeared and the ring is once again as beautiful as it was when I received it. I wear it all the time, but not in the pool!"
5,Underground Poetry That Could Use A Warning Label,"It hits the whole spectrum of human thought, from darkness to light. It brings you to the edge and tosses you over. What a ride! A read and read again!"
4,Really Good Flash Book,"I bought the last edition of this book (Flash MX 2004 Savvy), and I'm happy I bought this version. Its just as good (and is even a good complement to the previous version). The only complaint I have (and why I gave it 4 stars) is that it is shorter than the last version. They dropped the price, which is good, but I would have prefered paying more for a longer book."
4,One of the better flavors,The potato is one of the flavors I'd probably buy again (if it goes on sale again). I found you have to follow the directions carefully though. When they say to stir after pouring in the water you better do it or you may end up with lumps. Also make sure to put a plate under it when microwaving because they can boil over. Otherwise no complaints other than being a little more expensive than other brands. Tastes like a decent quality potato and onion soup and it's fast to make and lightweight to carry.
3,Hardys in the Bahamas!,"Deep trouble is an okay kids book - adventure, treasure, and a touch of education. It's not the best Hardy Boys book out there, but it's okay."
2,BBOORRIINNGG!,"This book was okay, but what's so scary about a bunch of mermaids that are trying to help you? I was very disappointed in this book because usually R.L. Stine writes very good horror books. Goosebumps is supposed to be all about horror, but I don't see the horror in this book."
2,"It was O.K., good for ages 8-11.","This book is about people that are on a ship sailing the ocean. It has monsters, mermaids, and few scares. It is a good book for ages 8-11, but over 11, they probably wouldn't like it."
2,Goosebumps never scares me at all and this book was 30%,It's not like Goosebumps to write about mermaids .The only thing scary is Alexander's spicy chicken sanwiches!
2,This book is bad.,When I was little I loved his books (I had and read all of them) but now I am just realizing how bad the Goosebumps series was. I haven't read this book in a long time but I know this book was bad. If you are a little kid you should read it but I think all the gosebump book should get a 4 or lower.
4,Fun in the sun.,"Rather than making you want to stay out of the water, Deep Trouble might inspire you to dive right in and explore the briny depths of the deep blue sea.While taking their annual summer vacation with their scientist uncle (lovingly nicknamed Dr. D) Billy Deep and his sister Sheena get caught up in a hunt for a mermaid. Things take a turn for the worse when Billy actually finds one.Deep Trouble is more of an adventure story than a horror yarn, but there is an intense run in with a hammerhead shark that's good for a shiver or two. Recommended reading for sea monster fans."
4,Deep Trouble,"When I first saw the cover of this book it looked really cool to me because it had a big shark on it. I thought this book would be more about sharks like other reviews said but it had mermaids in it instead. Even though it wasn't really about sharks I still like the characters and the storyline of the book. This book is about a brother and sister, Sheena and Billy who are visiting there uncle Dr.Deep, who studies things in the water. In the book everyone is on a ship. Later in the book Billy finds a mermaid in the water. This book isn't a super scary book, but it is for sure one you have to read in the series, its a good book!!"
3,good only for kids about 8-11,"the book maybe enticing to young kids but compared to great pieces by the authors shakespeare, lois lowry, louis sachar, and avi. I read the book about 3 times when i was young. It was ok. nothing scary, but it would make a great movie. i suggest you get it from the library instead of buying it because it WILL get boring."
3,A page turner.,This is an eventful book about many things including mermaids kidnappers and sharks to name a few. Although this book is not scary it is interesting. I enjoyed it
3,A surprisingly mature turn for Stine,"I read this book more than a decade ago, and much of the events are not fresh on my mind. However, I do remember coming away from this book with a brighter outlook on adventure in the sea. The story, while having a hammerhead shark on the cover and being a Goosebumps installment, is not designed so much as a horror or thriller, but as a cautionary tale about our duty to protect the world around us.Deep Trouble, while not great literature, is probably as close as you're going to get with Stine or Goosebumps, and honestly, I'm still impressed with this delightfully intelligent turn by the famed children's author. I remember sitting in the library and reading this book from cover to cover in one sitting. It's not a horror story, but of all the Goosebumps books out there, it's probably the one WORTH reading."
5,Machinery Malfunction Diagnosis,"Mr. Eisenmann has compiled his years of ""hands on"" experience into this book. Although the information contained within the book applies to most types of rotating machinery, it's focused on high speed process machinery with journal type bearings. I've read dozens of vibration analysis books and none even comes close to this one. It is a must have for any vibration analysis who needs to understand non rolling element bearing type machines."
2,Not the best survival guide available,Although Ms. Fromer gives all the treatment options available for endometriosis the information is the same as what you will find in The Endometriosis Sourcebook. If you are looking for a complete guide to treating this disease then get the sourcebook and do not waste your time and money purchasing this book.
1,Save your money!,I did not care for this book at all. I found that the author's chapter on infertility was on the insulting side.
1,don't buy this book,This is a very badly written negative book. The author did not research the topics very well and she seems to dwell on any negative thing that can happen to a woman. I had to stop reading the book because it was depressing me and turning me into a pessimist about my own fertility.
3,It is ok...,"This is a decent book. If you are an advanced photoshop user, there are a couple of things that you will be able to pick up from. It also helps open your mind to possibilites of blending images together."
4,Good for trips to the mountains,"I had thought this might be a little more detailed, but it gives the basics and is good for taking to our trips to the mountains."
2,inadequate,"This treatment of Lincoln is inadequate at best. I've read other biographies in the ""Penguin Lives"" series (e.g. Jane Austen, Napoleon) that were fine within the scope of the series' purpose, but this one fell short. For example, the author seems to be projecting his own religious views on Lincoln when his characterizes Lincoln as an agnostic without much proof . This is reminiscent of how Lincoln was characterized as a kind of stain-glassed Evangelical for so many years by writers of that persuasion. Lincoln is more complex than this in his religious perspective. Likewise in the evolution of his views on slavery. My suggestion is not to waste any time or money on this volume, but instead to pick up a much better one-volume biography: ""With Malice Toward None"" by Stephen Oates. In his source notes at the back, Keneally himself states that this is his own favorite book about Lincoln."
1,"Conjecture, Fabrication, and Pop-Psychology","King's scholarship is severely in question in this book. Many of his claims about both Rasputin and Yusupov are mixtures of conjecture, pop-psychology, and pseudo-mysticism. In some cases, they're downright libelous.Too bad Felix Yusupov isn't alive to sue him, too. (As he did both MGM and CBS).King makes claims that cannot in any way be substantiated, but he presents them as truth, as allegations, and as innuendoes. The book comes across as an apologists attempt to paint Rasputin in a good light and to brand Yusupov as some kind of insane sex-criminal.King even maintains that Rasputin could actually heal!In most of the rest, he just re-quotes other sources. I know that stealing from more than one source is research, not plagiarism, but the only new insights into the events are from King's imagination.Read it as fiction, not as fact. Yusupov might not have told the complete truth in his memoirs, but you can't take this book as fact either."
3,It was good about not revealing the story but lacked detales,I appriceated the way it tells you how to get out of a fix. It explains for example that when you climb twinpeak mountain to find Jon it explains the directions. Some guids just say climb twinpeak and go to Jon. But I wish it would give better atack stratagies and not just say how to defeat the foe.
2,Print version is better than the Kindle version,"As with most travel books in Kindle format - this one is hard to use. The maps are too small to read. It cannot be browsed easily for information unless you know exactly what you're looking for. Kindle is good for reading where you start at the beginning and read to the end, not for browsing for ideas of where to go. Although I hoped to be able to lighten my luggage by cutting down on the number of travel guides to take, I am still taking a print version of this book on my trip."
1,not a 5 pack,Doesn't clean as well as a standard brass brush and it is not a 5 pack as the description says.
2,Cute Item But Definitely Overpriced,bought as a xmas gift for my 10 year old nice. when it arrived ... it was one small lip gloss smaller than my pinkie finger. tiny little stick with a lip gloss at end. i was very disappointed. i would not recommend purchasing this item. cost too much for what you get.
1,"disappointed, seemed useless","Didn't find it interesting at all. After deciding that it had no appeal to me, I donated it away, so I hope that someone else will enjoy it."
2,A nice big book with good written descriptions but pictures aren't great,"We were hoping this book would have better pictures - clearer, crsiper, more vibrant colors and the worst part...that it would have more pictures of each bird. We mainly wanted a book with lots of pictures to help identify all the varieties of each species of bird. This book gives you one or two pictures of a bird and then say ""there are 14 or 25 varieties of this bird"". Well, since those 14 or 25 varieties of a bird species can and do look materially different from one another, having one picture from one angle of one bird is really very disappointing and ridiculous actually. We made a bad purchase on this one. :-(Let me know if you know of a better book, I'd still like to find a good one."
5,Best bird book in the state!!!W,"Dear Readers,For all you bird lovers, this is the book. IT is the most detailed and well made book that has ever been made. You will never have a problem trying to discern one bird from another. The pictures that Tveten takes are some of the most detailed and close pictures ever. God knows how hard it is to get good close-ups. While it is a little hard to carry in the field, the hard copy makes one of the best coffee table books ever. You might also want to check out Shearer Publishings state atlases, the best and most detailed maps in the country. I strongly support these fine books from Fredericksburg, Texas."
4,Bird Book for Beginners,"This is a very fine book with photographs taken in the field. Another reviewer suggested this book ""if you're only going to have one bird book."" My wife and I prefer another book, but this one contains excellent information to supplement the other which is more of a field guide. This book also describes the evolution of the bird classification system, and how the names and designations of some birds have changed with DNA evidence. The author is clearly an expert in his field. Some sources list a hardcover version, but when we tried to get it, it was out of print."
3,"A good book that states the obvious, but...","My husband and I agree with the premise of sleep sharing and are doing so with our 2 little ones. However, if you are looking for a book that offers practical tips on the transition from your bed to theirs, keep looking."
2,Don't Judge a Book by its Cover,"I bought this book because of the adorable cover photo and my interest in the topic of co-sleeping. I was looking for practical information and perhaps some personal anecdotes, but was very disappointed when I found a philosophical, awkwardly compiled volume. I found it to be so unreadable that I could not bear to finish it. Fortunately, I also purchased a book called Good Nights by J.Gordon M.D and Maria Goodavage, which provided the practical information I was looking for in a very enjoyable manner."
1,NOT SAFE,"According to the book, the author is saying that there are benefits sleeping with your baby. I do not agree; then why do cribs exist. Babies should NEVER sleep in the same bed as the parents. There are NUMEROUS accidents of babies suffocating due to the parents rolling over. If the experts all state that a baby should NEVER sleep with the parents in the same bed, then perhaps we should all follow this advise. This book should should be taken off the market...we do not need people encouraging parents to sleep with their children. If there were ever an accident to occur, the parents will blame themselves and they should."
5,The strange thing the 'West' do,"I have just finished the book and was surprised on the cruelty the 'West"" has been doing to their own children (by leaving them alone in the night, leaving them to cry).I realise now that I am fortunate to have come from a culture where co-sleeping is common. I have a 15-month old daughter and we co-sleep. When I talked to my mother today about this book, both of us shoke our head, knowing that the 'West' actually has to write a book to talk about the benefit of something so obvious.If the 'West' wants to save more babies from accidents, perhaps they can begin by preventing the parents from transporting their babies in cars."
3,"Not bad, not that helpful","This is a fine book for anyone who wants the basics of why letting a baby sleep in your bed is OK, but it lacks the practical everyday tips so many new parents need. I just read (and reviewed for Amazon) the book Good Nights: The Happy Parents Guide to the Family Bed, which has everything I could ask for in a book about this subject -- humor, excellent scientific research and chapters chock full of practical advice. Three in a Bed is a decent book for those new parents who want more philosophy and history than helpful advice that will let them get more sleep. I don't know many new parents who fit that description, but I know they're out there!"
2,Cautions:,"1. This is not the complete opera. The director has omitted the Prologue, which is need to introduce the opera in the context of Monteverdi's era.2. Characters dress in 20th century costume (so, a modernized performance).3. The performance practices are not historically accurate.But, if you are interested in a modern interpretation of one of the more significant early operas, you may enjoy this DVD."
2,What's with the sound mix?,"I'm puzzled by the other reviewers' positive comments. First, the sound was clearly recorded in studio and synched to the live performance, sometimes quite poorly. The mix is terrible, which is bizarre given the above. The acocmpaniment, especially the harpsichord, is very clear, but the singers are muddy and hard to hear. It's generally considered pretty important in opera to be able to hear the singing.Costuming is mix and match-most of the characters wear clothes in quasi-Roman tailoring, but made of silkish polyester. You'll know why when you see the title singer's admirable endowments through her translucent top. However, the one major ""good guy,"" Otho, wears Nazi black leather; I'm really not sure what they had in mind here.Set is an opera house one that probably looks great live, but as usual appears cheesy on screen. If they were not going to record a live performance, I'm not sure why they used it."
1,very bad,"I bought it new from Amazon. In a 4-5 month it broke down. The rollers stopped to spin. I brought it to the DeWalt service station. They fixed it, it took 10 days. In a years and a half it broke again. Same problem. Rollers don't spin. Now I don't have warranty anymore and will have to pay God knows how much.Bottom line. The machine is full of you know what."
5,Very Satisfied Customer,"This has got to be the best portable Planer I have used to date. It gives a fine finish even on the hardest woods. I have had a hard time even creating snipe. The built in fan assisted chip ejection is awsome. All you need is to attach a hose and point the chips where you want them to go. I bought the mobile cart and fashioned an enclosure underneath to catch the chips with an exhaust filter, and it works great."
2,Packaging/shipping problems still not addressed,"My planer arrived today with a crack in the aluminum base, and a small piece of the base ready to break off. The styrofoam packing materials were all broken and cracked, not doing their job. I've read reviews here back to October 2003 that point out the problems with the packaging. It's hard to believe that no one at Dewalt or Amazon has recognized this as a problem and done something about it by now."
1,Buy something else,"I'm a professional woodworker and have used this planer for two years. I would have dumped this one and invested in a different one if I had the extra money. If you buy this one from Dewalt, plan to spend alot of money on blades. They dull very quickly, even in soft wood like cedar. I've also had to replace the rotating handle three times after either the screw attachment or handle broke. For the past 6 months, the unit fills up inside with wood dust and shavings. And, because of the open design inside, the wood particles jam up the sprockets that raise and lower the machine. I also hate the fact that there's very little support for wood when it exits the machine...causing it to snipe (cause divots in the wood) significantly. And, last but not least, it's almost impossible to find someone who can repair it! Dewalt wants $200+ to do their over-haul. Hardly worth it!Buy something else!"
4,consider replacement blade costs when buying,"I really like my Dewalt 735 planer. It has plenty of power, does a great job of planning all types of wood, and with the extension trays I added, minimizes snipe.I have mine connected to a vacuum system, so chips and shavings are no problem.The biggest draw back is the price of the replacement blades. They are advertised as disposable blades, which might make some people think they are inexpensive. Around $50 a set, they are a major expense in operating this planer. I go though a set of blades about once a year. It only takes a small piece of grit to nick the blades, and they can't be resharpened, so make sure your boards are absolutely clean before planing."
2,"Good Planer for soft woods only, and the blades are terrible","I missed the fine print when I bought this planer - the blades are disposable. I tried to plane some maple with them and after 1/2 hour, I had tear-out and scoring - it just ruined a bunch of figured wood. When I removed them (they are reversible), I couldn't score my fingernail with EITHER side. The solution is for DeWalt to come up with a quality blade package that can be resharpened and will take a micro edge.I would not recommend this planer to anyone planing hardwood or figured wood. It may be O.K. for softwood, but when you spend the amount of money that this thing costs and then realize its limitations are softwood, it's a major dissappointment. I would strongly advise anyone shopping for a planer for hardwood applications to look for blades that can be resharpened and a reasonable quality. Don't waste your time with this turkey."
4,good buy,"It is a pretty good planer, very solid. The only reason I'm writing this review is because I find it interesting that I bought this for about $425 almost 2 years ago. Skip investing in the stock market, I might just buy a truck-load of planers =)"
5,Great shop planer,Quality contractor/home shop planer. Even though it weighs in at 92lbs. I would still consider it portable for a framing/trim crew. A certain box store that begins with the letter L has them for $450 until 3/31/08.EDIT:Lowe's has dropped their base price to $498 and the 17% off still applies until 3/31/08. Great planer for around $400.
1,Disappointed,"Pulled the planer out of the shipping box and discovered about a 2"" x 3"" area of the aluminum base was chipped out. Thought that perhaps I could live with that but then I tried to adjust the depth. Planer is supposed to have a range from 1/8"" to 6"" thick. However, it would not move out of the 3/4"" to 1"" range.Then comes the service. I had to physically bring the 100 pound machine to the nearest DeWalt service center. Even though I live in a big city the nearest service center was over 40 miles away. They said it will take about 2 weeks to repair and I need to drive back and pick it up because they could not ship."
2,Sniping And Ridges,"I bought the Dewalt 2-3 yrs. ago. My first impressions were very favorable, the 3 knife head did a smoother job in fast feed than my other planers did in slow. It did a good job on pine, but when I started planing red oak it started sniping and leaving ridges in my boards. I rotated the knives and it helped for 2 or 3 boards then I started seeing these problems again. The sniping occures on both infeed and out even while lifting up on the lumber, because of this I'm reluctant to buy the extension tables($50). Dewalt advised me to feed in high until the finish cut to improve blade life, I've purchased 3 sets of knives at $50/set to plane 300-400 ft. of clean oak that I ran through my old Ryobi to insure that it was clean. I've been a toolmaker for 25 yrs. and I believe the grind on the knives is too thin to hold up to hard wood."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,Bought this unit about a year and a half ago and have planed A LOT of lumber with it. I have also gone through a lot of blades. DEWALT ARE YOU LISTENING!!!!!!!! I now live with the ridges until they get out of control and just do the extra sanding and sanding (we all love) to get rid of them. It's a shame as otherwise I feel it is a well thought out design and operationally it has given me no trouble whatsoever.I save my money for this and am currently saving my money to replace it. Save your money and buy something else from the start.
3,"Kevin - Appleton, Wisconsin","Decent planer, but very lousy knives. Planing less then 100 board feet on hemlock and white pine and the blades are already junk, plus they're expensive to replace. DeWalt should really construct some better knives"
5,It's the best I've used so far...,"I was about to purchase a new portable planer, and had narrowed my choice down to either the Delta or the Rigid - both are good tools, but I think DeWalt has ""aced"" them on this one. That is saying a lot, considering it came from me and I am by nature more of a ""Delta"" type guy. HOWEVER, in all fairness a tool should be rated by it's capabilities, user - friendliness, and design. In other words, when you are talking portable planers - what kind of work can it do ? My answer : ""OUTSTANDING WORK"" ! It is so easy and simple to set up and use, the preset thickness stop was a pleasant surprise and is dead on, blades reverse and are simple to change ( no more gauging or aggravation). I have used it on White Oak which is VERY hard and prone to chipout, and it is impressive. It is priced higher than some - due in part to its ""newness"", I should think, but as I said - It is definately worth it in my opinion."
3,DeWalt DW735 15 Amp 13-Inch Benchtop Planer,"I have seen some negative reviews on this product. I dont think they are deserving. For the price, this planer has worked very well. I plane very hard woods and have not had a problem yet. I take my time when planing so I do not wear out the blades too fast. For the home woodworker, I think it is a very good machine."
5,I love this machine!!!,"I've used my machine on Oak 2x's I pulled out of my old hog house ,Walnut that's gone through floods & even store bought rough cut lumber.I've had better luck than the other reviewers on bladewear. Snipe? Wouldn't know what it is! I got the table extensions from the start.I would highly recommend the dust collector Dewalt sells for this machine. It'll blow chips all over your shop if you don't! Or better yet,spend big bucks on a nice dust collector. A good wheat crop & that will be my next toy !"
2,Taking it to the dump,"I've had this planner for about 4 years and I'm taking it to the dump as soon as my Makita planner comes in. I've had it in to the Dewalt service center 4 times because I could no longer raise or lower the bed. I'm not sure what the problem is - whether saw dust is blocking the sprockets or the posts are moving, but Dewalt does not seem to be able to make a lasting repair - and they don't seem too concerned about it when I talk to them. Other people here have mentioned how quickly the blades dull. Some of the more expensive aftermarket blades are better, but not much better - it you do a lot of work planning, you need to have a supply of replacement blades. The only thing I like was the dust extractor - which blows sawdust out - you don't have to pull it out - but the inside of the machine does fill up with saw dust.My advice, look for a different planner."
