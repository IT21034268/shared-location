3,This is a B- record,"I'd give ""Palookaville"" 3.5 stars if I could. ""You've Come A Long Way, Baby"", Fatboy Slim's second album, is still my favorite. ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" is a close second. This one is going to be third on my list. It has its moments, and most of the tunes are catchy, and it's much better than ""Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars."" I would recommend getting this album if you're an Astralwerks fan, a Fatboy fan, or if you just like good DJ records.P.S. regarding DJ Rico (i.e. ""Amazon Does Not Ship Real Product""). Numbnuts ordered the CLEAN version of this album...that's why the pictures were ""MS Painted"" over. You can check it out for yourself."
1,Different...,"*I* don't like it. If I could, I'd get a refund but that's not an option (bought it from one of those online music stores that's paired closely to a well selling mp3 player).I considered myself a pretty big Fatboy fan, got all his other stuff. I love breaks and am a big fan of big beat. I can listen to this album and recognize it is well done and will be considered very good by some, but you can't think of it as ""Oh new Fatboy song, better go ahead and pick up more goodness!"" Almost more of a dub style. Ah well, maybe it'll grow on me over time, but it's a pretty big letdown after the greatness of Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars."
1,I expected something better from Fat Boy!!,"This album sounds like he is going on his way out, especially when it comes to dance music!! I could comapre this album to a famous rock band going from hard rock to soft rock!!!"
2,Horribly Dissapointed :-(,"I had hear this album sucked from a friend who I generally trust, but didn't wanna believe it cuz I wanted to hear from Fatboy Slim again! So I bought it with the sampler CD...In all honesty there are maybe one or two songs I like on the album itself, the REAL treat was the sampler! Ok I know the songs on the sampler weren't Fatboy style, but they were better than this junk. It was very disappointing."
1,Dated and boring,"the 3 first tracks are sort of OK and it's downhill all the way, one sampled phrase repeated all the way through the songs, this is really big beat by the numbers. A parody of the genre. This sounds so dated. It could have been released 8 years ago by some of the bigbeat clones that appeared when he got big in the late 90's.Fatboy is right when he says dance music is dead, and he proves it with this album.I'm just puzzled on how does he manage to work so long on such boring tracks, and who tells him ""this track is great, put it in the LP"".Only for the tone deaf, or musically uneducated"
4,All the Way with Amazon's Earl Grey!,"This is a great tea at an excellent price. Each tin is vacuum sealed. I don't have the ability to use up a lot of tea quickly so once the vacuum seal is broken, I stored the unused tea in plastic sealed bags."
2,More of a black tea than an Earl Grey,"As readily available tea brands go, I prefer Bigelow's Earl Grey to Twinings' version but I had only tried the tea bags so I took a chance on the loose tea based on the positive reviews. Unfortunately, the tea was just as meh as I remembered. I actually prefer regular black tea such as PG tips to this Earl Grey.I am going to use up the loose tea one tablespoon at a time in a 1-quart Ball canning jar for sweet tea (1/4 to 1/3 cup of white sugar and a mint sprig)."
4,I. Love. This. Tea.,"I don't pretend to know everything about tea, but I know what I like. This I one of the best. Loose leaf from England. Mmmmm. I've made it hot and iced and both are perfect. An the tin is lovely to use one the tea is gone. :)"
5,my morning fix,"so happy to have my stash of ""the earl"" in the cabinet. the tea is constantly delicious and glad that amazon offers auto delivery of this item. i am never out of tea. happy to have that pot hot and ready each morning. never mind the occasional afternoon cuppa ."
5,Powerex Battery charger w/8 2700 mAh Batteries,This is my Second Powerex Charger The first one which was a Maha lasted 8 years ans is still working but upgraded to new batteries and a Charger as well. Can't beat the price.
1,D O A SLOW CHARGE DOESN'T WORK,"After hours of reading reviews I decided this was the battery charger for me.I set it on slow charge and after 6 hours the batteries were not even warm.Just found a review yesterday and they had the same issue. I have read abouttop brand names that overheat and can actually melt or blast the batteries right outof the charger; These are the expensive, programmable units that take endless patience to use. Anyone know of a good charger for my 2700 mAh batteries?"
3,Didn't Work for Me,"I usually love WS cookbooks, but this one just didn't cut it for me. It's fairly thin compared to the others, and used a higher ratio of unusual/uncommon ingredients than most. (Nopales and squid are the two examples that most stand out.)I'm sure if I'd tackled more of them most of the recipes would have turned out well, but they didn't appeal. If you love Mexican food, this is worth checking out, but if you only cook it occasionally or casually I'd skip this one."
4,Authentic,"I first got this book from the library. My boyfriend is from Mexico, so I thought it'd be fun to try some recipes for him. After trying some, he stated that is reminded him of food his mom would make him. I only tried 3-4 recipes, but they were yummy!"
1,Disappointed,I love Williams-Sonoma so I was very disappointed with the recipes in this book - too bland for me. Maybe I just need to keep tweaking the recipes. We'll see.
3,"Doesn't fit perfectly, but looks pretty good.","It doesn't fit exact specs with the original. It's close, but does not hug the body like the original. It's shiney and seems to be made with tough plastic. It looks good."
4,"Great product, too high of price...","I have owned four of these over the past 10 years. The batteries give out after three years then you have to buy a new one. The price is way too high but they are the only comparable product available. I suspect the patent will soon run out and competitors will come into the market - bringing the price down. Until then, buy em' they work great!"
3,Eh.,"I don't regret buying this album, but I only paid two dollars for it. It sort of sounds like Black Cherry without Goldfrapp, and with a vaguely annoying woman instead. You know all those irritating groups that got signed after Dummy came out that had sort of the same idea but sucked a lot more? I guess this is like the Goldfrapp version of that. But the arrangements sound really good. I think I made it to track ten before I turned it off. An instrumental version would be really nice."
4,Interesting read.,"I bought this book to understand the whole notion of Jihad more clearly. While the book did give a thorough explanation of the origins of the Jihad mindset, there is as much theology as secular history. This was helpful in understanding the topic from a religious, as well as secular viewpoint, which is, after all, the motivating factor for Jihadists. It is an older text and could stand a revision to bring it up to date."
2,Step mother Ireland,"very flowery, slow moving not up to the level of many other Irish writers, not suited to my taste such as history or amusing recollections"
3,A book about a genius.,"This book mainly describes the life of Edmond Halley and the accomplishments that he has made throughout his life. It told less about the comet than I anticipated and more about the rest of the life which I liked. It kept me attracted to the book while I was amazed at the many things that he had done throughout his life.This book also told of the tragic side of his life. However, it never expressed what feelings Edmond Halley showed when these things occurred. I would say that it is okay when you are dealing with a person of that far in the past.This book rates fairly well. Its a little off books like ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and is a biography so it shouldn't be like that. Overall, the book was also well written, however could get boring at times. It may seldomly tended to explore one area too much leaving the reader bored. I understood the book very well and rate it good."
1,Are Your Freakin' Kidding Me???,"Remember all those jokes about selling land in the Everglades or any other thing a `snake oil salesman' will tell you fits here perfectly. 2.0 ounces of anything for this price should be nothing less than gold. Body Glove is a great company with great products, but seriously, simple ""spit"" from your mouth will do the trick to defog your goggles. If you have to have something in a bottle, try ""Aqua Seal Sea Gold Mask Anti-Fog Gel"". It also works and is a lot cheaper. Spend your money on a nice vacation!"
1,DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I TRIED THIS PRODUCT WHICH WAS PURCHASED AT A LOCAL SPORTS SHOP AND IT SUCKS! YOUR OWN SPIT WORKS BETTER AS A DEFOGGER THAN THIS CRAP. IF YOU WANT A GOOD CHEAP SOLUTION TO A SNORKEL MASK DEFOGGER, BUY THE J&J BABY SHAMPOO NO TEARS FORMULA. IT WORKS WELL! PROBABLY JUST AS WELL AS ANY OTHER EXPENSIVE DEFOGGER OUT THERE."
1,dont even bother,"holy flying crackers!Save your time, money, electricity and wear and tear on your couch and don't watch this movie.Its not even funny. I was close to just turning it off about 10 minutes in. It was a waste of resources to even make this movie. It's about bag boys who compete in a competitions to see who can fill bags the fastest. They go on the pro circuit and travel the US. All Lame!This movie would not even be good if it was playing in the waiting room while I was waiting for my oil to be changed.Not funny! Not worth watching! Not worth anything!"
5,river rat standard equipment,"i bought these for hiking in and thru streams as well as to flyfish and as approach shoes to streams.i use a pair of smart wool cycling socks (low style, that comes just above the top of the shoe by aprox 2inches)this ellimanatesskin rubbing against the synthetic of the shoe, allowing for more comfortabe extended use. the socks wick the water away when you come out onto dry land.they work well on land as they are very shock absorbant in the heal strike. but i was most amazed with the grip they offer on wet rock. great for bolder hoping in water as well as some spontanious rock scrambling on dry land. overall a light weight comfortable shoe for just about any outdoor activity."
2,Not good for kayaking,"I bought these after reading reviews saying how good they are. While the shoe feels good to wear and I love the quick tie system and the option to collapse the heel, the buckle of the heel adjustment strap makes the shoe unusable for me. I bought them to use in kayaking. But when I place my feet on the foot pegs in the kayak, the side of each foot presses up against the side of the kayak and the buckle is in between my foot and the side of the kayak. For very short paddles, it might not be a problem, but for adventure races where the paddle can last several hours, I am left with a very painful area where my foot has been pressing against the buckle.... Not sure how it could be designed to prevent this, but I can't use this shoe for anything else..."
4,"enjoyable, fast, fairly well written","a compelling story of an artist's life in a tiny Newfoundland town, around 1900. the bottom line: i couldn't put it down and read it straight through -pretty rare for me in recent years, Norman's foreshadowing and solid character development was enough to successfully create some anticipation and sucker me in. still, it's not a five-star book; the writing is a little uneven, with dialogue sparkling on some pages, not on others, little factoids of Newfoundland life sometimes seem pushed in, sometimes he loses momentum and i occasionally found myself just skimming through paragraphs. but certainly a fine enough book for a plane, vacation, quiet evening, etc. the mix of a long personal history and nice character interaction and development is reminiscent of another recent bestseller, `the kite runner', which is longer and denser, yet seemed executed at a slightly higher level all around - well worth a look if you enjoy `bird artist.'"
5,a marvelous book,"If you want a book to take with you to the beach that you won't be embarassed to have been caught reading, look no further. I may be biased as I read it under what may be perfect circumstances -on a foggy island on the coast of Maine, with the foghorn and the marine radio for background, but even for the shore-bound among you believe me that this is what The Shipping News never could deliver. Beautifully written with nary a wasted word this book captures both the period and The Rock in a way that I have yet to find in any other author. While the narrator may infuriate you at times you will also find yourself rooting for him throughout, and although we ""know what will happen"" from the first paragraph on the WHY & the HOW keeps you going to the end."
2,Lacking,"The explanations in this ""educational"" toy leave much to be explained. The materials included items are very low quality and basically in one heap and finding what you need takes more time than doing the actual experiment."
4,Love Calamity Jane,"I bought this album for the soundtrack from Calamity Jane. I really didn't need the other soundtrack. The music is fun in this film and I really love the ""Black Hills of Dakota"" song. Two great voices in Doris Day and Howard Keel. I own many musical soundtracks or broadway cast recordings but it is this music that I keep coming back to again and again. It just makes me feel good."
4,365 Ways to Motivate and Reward goes the extra mile,"365 Ways to Motivate and Reward goes the extra mile in providing an understanding of the difference between the Band-Aid approaches to employee motivation and the understanding of true motivation from the employees' perspective. Podmoroff provides statistics from studies that looks at the employees reasoning behind needed recognition, acceptance and that good ole pat on the back. Inspired and motivated employees from management to the janitor foster a highly motivational workplace and this resource provides example after example of tips and techniques that help to create the motivated employee.Helping the employee to claim ownership in his/her, organization is paramount to creating the positive workplace environment necessary for healthy, growing organizations and Podmoroff has provided 365 ways to do this."
3,Not for beginners,"I liked this book because it mentioned every major aspect of judo, but it doesn't really cover any subject in tremendous depth and the ""sequence"" photos are usually just one per technique, which could make it difficult to follow if you've never seen the throws before. The introduction and glossary are good, and there are sections on gripping, combinations, and contest preparation, making it very well rounded, but again, not very in depth."
4,What A Beautiful CD,"This CD is definately for romantics and the laid-back crowd. The first songs are seductive with female voices in the background. But then CW hits us with a positive note on ""Solidarity""-- A great twist to ""What's Going On."" This CD is just so pleasant to listen to. I would give it 4 and a half stars. And although ""Changes (1992)"" in my opinion had a bit more soul and old-school jam quality (with songs like ""Dreamin' and ""Everything U Do"")-- on ""Not a Perfect Man"" CW fans will not be disappointed. I definately wasn't. This is real R&B. And although CW isn't gonna get as much airplay as the Ushers or the Ginuwine's-- He's unique in the R&B scene."
2,"Love Gregg Diamond, But Lousy Production Values","I agree with one of the previous reviewers on the production of this CD. The songs were recorded directly from vinyl without any re-mastering. You can hear the tracking of the needle on the record. Also, it sounds like it was recorded in a tin room. Not worth the asking price."
2,Senior Workout DVD,"I recently purchased this DVD and I really was kind of disappointed in it. I've purchased other types of Senior DVD's and this one can't begin to compare. The woman who does the exercise instruction is kind of strange. Can't put my finger on it, but I just was not impressed with her and she doesn't explain the exercises first. She just does them, and quite quickly, too, and it's hard to keep up with her. I really enjoy working out with other Senior-type DVD's I've had, but this one not so much."
2,It was okay,This video was okay. I guess I expected a little more. I think if the person doing the exercises was the person speaking I would have liked it better.
2,"Good exercises, bizarre presentation","This program was designed for seniors/rehab, but the pace is very fast. The repetitions are much too fast for older folks or those who may be recovering from injury.The exercises were very good for a chair workout. However, the program was narrated while Sunshine sat on her stool by the ocean with a frozen smile on her face the entire time she was following instruction. I thought this presentation was bizarre and awkward. It would have been better if she herself talked into the camera and engaged the audience. The narrator said ""You're doing great!"" after every exercise. It was supposed to be serious, but was quite funny. Sunshine never spoke, but waved goodbye at the end. It was really pretty comical. I would not use this series again."
3,Frozen Face,I purchased this item for my mother who has had a stroke. She did not like the model in the video saying that it looks like the head does not belong to the body. The model has the same expression all the way through the workout--a silly grin that looks like it's painted on. It's so monotonous and fake. The exercises are o.k.
1,Danger,"I bought this toy for my four and a half year old son for Christmas. In less than an hour, a small magnet (the size of a tic tac) had come out of the toy. This is extremely dangerous! If magnets are swallowed by young children, the results can be deadly. Please be very careful if you choose to buy this toy for your children."
1,Not as advertized.,"""Large, lighted dial is easy to read any time of day or night"" NOT, unless you reach out and hit the snooze button. One big reason I purchased this clock was the ""lighted dial"". It is NOT lit in normal condition. Not worth the cost of product and shipping. If shipping was free I'd send it back, but it's not worth wasting another dime on.I gave it 1 star because it is a clock and works as a clock."
4,"Good, not excellent","It is good, not excellent. Little too big, the photograph doesn't give you real dimension. I would say, it is 12x12 cm... It looks somewhat cheap otherwise is good. If I was it on the shelf say in a store, I would possibly pick something else. Video would also help... It may be good for someone whos idea of sleeping room design is everything gold."
3,Timex clock,"The clock is very functional and attractive. However, I purchased it as a TIMEX clock. The face of the clock reads ELGIN. The is hard to explain. I will keep the clock and do enjoy its size and readability."
1,misleading subtitle,"i have also bought its 1997 edition not knowing that both book are the same, only their subtitle are different, the one : transforming power of mystical experience, the other : walking the mystical path in everyday life. its disappointing from a ""sufi"" writer. (otherwise i can use the money to buy other books) wasuku."
5,amazing - best jewish singer out i've ever heard,best voice I have ever heard in my life... must listen to - especially hatikva!
3,more to offer,visit pumaairusa.comwe like to know how can we sell items thru your site.John Chieu 630-860-9555
2,"Good performance, not reliable","I have a E1705 with T7200, 7900GS, 1GB ram & XP with Vista disks.The laptop started crashing to a blue screen after about 8-9 month useand is crashing more and more frequently. NMI, memory parity error.Dell is coming next week to replace my motherboard and GPU amd RAM.The performance is very good in gaming, but reliablity is subpar.Update: at 16 months, no display, Dell is going to replace motherbaord again. I have the 4 year on site warranty. Don't buy this laptop without the extended warranty."
2,overpriced for the quality,"I used to have toshiba laptops, so I decided to try with Dell, the computer looks good, but I think are not well configurated, almost all the time I have conflict problems with windows (I never have this problem with toshiba). The computer is made of cheap plastic, so you need to be very careful. When you call to Dell for help, it's very dificult to find the right person, so at the end I prefered pay for a technician. In the future I'm going to buy a toshiba again (definitly are better computers and better service)."
4,Everything important you should know about the clarinet!,Read an earlier edition of this great book. Can't wait to get my hands on this most recent copy and call it my own. Answered all my questions in a clear manner and revealed so many new things that would have taken me years to discover for myself. Great book!!
5,SERIOUS BOOK,This is a serious book for people who are interested in the Clarinet and how to play it and care for it. It is not for a 4th grade beginning student.
1,"""Lousy remastering of a good album!!!""","I can't believe that anything remastered this badly could ever be released!!! On the ""Snoopy and his Friends"" half of the CD,a big piece of the beginning of ""Snoopy Vs.The Red Baron"" is missing from the song!!! Does anyone check these things out before they come out?!!! Apparently not!!! It's bad enough that fans like me wait for a certain LP to come out on CD only to get stuck with a shoddy job like this,but it also means that as long as a piece of ... like this is on the market,it will take that much longer before it is re-released and done RIGHT..."
5,Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron,Snoopy vs. the Red Baron is a classic. I'm so glad I found this CD. It's a family favorite that we will pass on to the next generation.
4,Fond Memories,"I had been looking for this CD for a while on Itunes and Zune.net, but couldn't get it. There were plenty of imitators, but I wanted the Royal Guardsmen version. I was glad to see it was affordable and available. Shipping was fast, but the cd case came cracked. The sound quality on the cd is about how I remembered it on the radio, so I wasn't disappointed. If you want a little trip down memory lane, this is a good way to start."
5,Classic!!,"This is a Classic! I recommend it for fans of 60's music, Peanuts, and WWI and Aviation History buffs. Not that it is historical but it is entertaining for all who might be armchair aviators or soldiers."
5,fordsrus,"This is such a great CD you will love every bit of it. If your a fan of Snoopy the red Baron and The Royal Guardsmen, you will love this. It brings back a lot of great memorys. The CD arrived very fast and it is wonderful. Buy this CD you can't go wrong."
4,Childhood Christmas,"Some people were dissapointed with the sound quality. My family owned Snoopy's Christmas on LP. The sound of this CD blows that out of the water, so I cannot complain. My Dad was very excited to find this in his stocking. Christmas felt like the old days. I was ten years old again, quoting ""Down Behind the Lines"" as if a day had not passed. A christmas tradition has been revived thanks to this CD!"
5,Very Satisfied,I looked for this recording for years!!! I am totally pleased and satisfied to finally have found it on Amazon. It arrived promptly and in good shape.
4,Four guys from Texas?,"I first heard of Seed on MTV's 120 minutes. They played ""Doe"" and ""Rapture"" live and I was amazed.The fretless bass and smooth vocals really stand out on this cd.Seed kicks it into high gear toward the latter part of the album with songs like ""Rapture"", ""Release"", and ""Tortoise"" and a last song that fades out only to fade in to something that has no real sense of direction, a woman speaking german, and a brief moment of kids on a playground.All in all a decent, and at times beautiful, cd that got passed over in the wake of bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, and (my favorite) The Smashing Pumpkins."
3,"sweatshirt was good, but it was extremely large","I liked the sweatshirt, it is super cool and very comfortable but it ran a size big. I wish they would have told us that because I ordered a medium and it could be a large."
4,Good from across the pond,"I first heard one of Plan B's tracks on a compilation of UK Hip-Hop. I instantly had to find the album. It's a great mix of the grime sound along with incredibly deft wordplay that rivals any of the stateside MC's with similar skills. But, what sets him apart from other artists is his use of an acoustic guitar to help him tell the stories he likes to spin. I recommend this for fans of hip-hop who are feeling as though they are getting bored and for fans of the grime sound."
5,"Happy to find the Norpro ""Boy and Girl Pancake Rings""","We had searched many kitchen supplies stores to find both both and girl shapes of the pancake rings for our granddaughters, but unfortunately none of those retailers carried the little girl shape. Someone found the ""Norpro"" name for us, and as a result we were able to obtain the sets on Amazon.com. Thank you very much!"
3,Review,"The slicer doesn't glide easily, so I had to add oil to lube it, which ended up being a little messy. There are probably better products out there."
5,AWSOME!,"These are great statues for any Star Wars fan except one small problem, the detalis on Lukes face are a little off but besides that they are really cool."
5,Highly recommend,Exciting book! Made me realize things about Jesus I had not thought of before!The style of writing is almost as if you're sitting in a congregation listening to the author preach.
5,love,I love reading anything about Jesus but this also was an added bonus ...... the price was an unbelievable added great surprise.
3,Nice to have for the library,"You won't learn any hidden truths here, Murray doesn't really expound on anything we already don't know, but as a good quick pick me up every now and then it's a good short read. It was free and I don't plan on deleting it :)I think it would be good for anyone who takes an interest in Christ beyond Sunday church."
2,Very repetitious,I tried very hard to finish this book but I was unable to do so because it kept repeating itself. I know that the wording and syntax were changed but the meaning wasn't as far as I was concerned. I was hoping for something new and original but found boring and pedantic. After awhile I just sighed and quit reading the book. I will give the author an A for effort and perhaps many will find comfort in this book but I was unable to do so.
1,what a loss.,I got 4 of these and found out there is no rotating motor. Just a bracket and metal box. I am so sorry I ordered these I will not buy anything else from these people. They came in a box with no shipping papers. They were stuffed in a box and shipped. Save your money and get a cardboard box and duct tape. Make your own and you will be happier.
2,Cute but lacking in substance!,"Yes, this was cute, light-hearted fun. However, it lacked wit in the dialogue, the plot was limited and the heroine was a bit of a twit. It needed more monstrous monsters, more horror and action and some soul from the main character. Apparently she lives a life where very few thoughts wander through her head and while she admits that, I did not find this aspect of her sympathetic or interesting. I do not understand how so many reviews gave this book five stars. This was cute and included a few unimaginative creatures that is the extent of it's charm.Give me a tough, sexy, mouthy heroine and lots of truly evil creatures such as Anita Blake's adventures or Kelley Armstrong's many strong, imaginitive female characters and I can see giving them 3 and 4 stars."
5,You Slay Me,A strong page turner. Very good charactor development even in sub-charactors. She has a real gift of prose.. I highly recommend this for laughs and frustration. lolI hope Ms MacAlister comes out with more in this series.Wege E
3,Cute,"This book is cute, but a little light weight. It tries real hard to be light and funny, it may try too hard because the humor is forced in places. Still, it's not bad for brain candy."
2,Good beginning downhill from there,"This author has so much potential. The Characters and story could have been so much better in some other author's hands. The female lead was whining, annoying and made so many stupid choices. For example, she refused to find out what a Guardian's job is. She refused to accept the protection of being the Draco's mate. Instead she blithly walked into another Dragon's weyr and got into trouble. Jim, her demon provides comic relief and Draco is to die for. By the time I got to the end she has made so many stupid decisions I ended up throwing the book against the wall. Read this for the sex scenes, but this is definately not a keeper."
2,the 4.5 reader rating is wrong,"usually the reader ratings on amazon are dead on, but not this time. i am glad i checked this out at the library. i read the entire book, just because i hate not finishing a story. i was 2/3 in before the story picked up. don't understand how she could not know she was a guardian or find someone who was willing to teach her how to be a guardian, then all of a sudden she just knew how to access her magic. i did like the dog, had the best lines. i also liked how she didn't submitt to drake even though she was his mate. i have noticed that mate automaticly fall in love without know the person. i am going to read the next book in the series, maybe it gets better"
3,Super Reader,"This is pretty lightweight stuff, meant to be so, I believe. Sort of somewhere between Men In Black and Midsomer Murders.A clueless girl finds out she is a Guardian, basically supposed to keep watch over a portal to make sure not too many demons and monsters come through. She has a few super powers to help with that she starts to learn, including demon summoning, which means she has a big black demon dog to follow her around.Seems it is tricky as she has a dragon she wants to shag, as well."
2,TSTL-heroine + hot deagon = not a good book,"I wanted to strangle Aisling most of the time. She actually reminded me a bit of Kathryn Janeway in Star Trek Voyager and I don't think she made one sane decision in the whole book. I am sorry, but she totally ruined a book with a lot of potential.I started another book one of Katie MacAlister's books a while ago and returned it after a few chapters and if it hadn't been for a buddy read I probably would have given up. I just wanted to push trough it and that is never a good sign! It reminded me a little bit of ""Ordinary Angels"" but that book was refreshing because there was no TSTL-moments. Just shows you can never trust the ratings!"
5,Funny First Person Access Into Another World,"I am a big fan of Katie MacAlister. She is able to create awesome and imaginative worlds with interesting and multi-dimensional characters, while keeping you laughing along the way. This book is one of my favorites, the first of her Guardian (Aisling Grey) series. Normally I am not a huge fan of series that follow the same character throughout each book, and I'm not wild about writing in first-person accounts (I like to get inside all of my character's heads) but MacAlister pulls it off beautifully. This book and series for that matter has the perfect combination of adventure, comedy, paranormal, and smut to keep any romance addict happy."
3,Fun,Aisling is a courier and has a very funny dog for a companion. She ends up losing the aritfact and dealing with an attractive and somewhat pushy guy. If it wasn't for Jim and his humor I wouldn't have continued with the series.
1,The Audiobook version is Awful!,"I love this series of books and decided to get the audiobook to listen to in the car on a long drive I had. What a mistake and waste of money. The audiobook version is simply horrible. The narrator Barbara (sorry, forgot the last name) reads it so fast that it's hard to listen to. The French accents sound authentic but are extremely garbled so even when the character is speaking English you can't understand them and the sound lowers so you have to turn up the volume. Also, I don't know how old this Barbara person is, but she sounds like she's in her 600's and Aisling is supposed to be 31. This Audoibook was a complete disappointment and I never did finish listening to it. I wanted to get the whole set of these in audiobook but if she is narrating them I'll pass and get something else to listen to in the car."
2,Couldn't finish it,"Frustrating read. I like the world and the secondary characters, but I hated the heroine and did not enjoy continually watching her make a complete fool of herself.That sort of thing can be funny, a la the Pink Panther movies, but it requires the author to stick to it. I can't be expected to point and laugh at the dodo at one point and then take her seriously at another. I think the first person narrative was also inappropriate. If I'm supposed to connect with her, don't make her an utter fool. Rather than laugh with her, I was cringing and skimming ahead.Also, for something billed as ""paranormal romance,"" it lacked romance. Aisling scarcely interacts with Drake in the book. There's no connection between them beyond the lazy Fated Mate trope.I made it 3/4 of the way through the book and just couldn't take any more of Aisling's poor choices. I skimmed through to find out whodunnit and tossed it on the 'donate' pile. I was so disappointed. I really wanted to like it."
2,"Should Be Called ""The Archaeology of Swords"" & not Weapons","I bought this mainly for what I could learn about fighting axes. What I got was a description of 3 vague axe types without any new (or much old)information about them. Thats not much in 330pp. I was disappointed from the second I opened it and leafed through it. Obviously there were a great many axes used in these times periods yet you wouldn't think so reading this book. The 95% of this is on swords. If you were interested in much of anything else from that time period, forget it. If swords are your thing this is for you."
2,"Decent content, but McGraw-Hall ought to spring for editing","Why didn't someone catch all the ""author... need caption"" captions that appear in here?Anyway, this could be a useful book if you already know about networking but don't really ""get"" routing, and especially Cisco routing. You'd need a lot more help, and knowing how Osborne/McGraw-Hill pushes books out the door (very fast and lightly edited, if that) I'm not sure I'd trust everything in here as gospel.I did find a good white paper that covers some of the same material from Cisco (called "" Gigabit Campus Network Design--- Principles and Architecture""; I know there are others up there)."
3,Good reference but difficult to read.,I am interested in designing IP networks and got this book and a few others. This book assumes that you have an advanced working knowledge and are comfortable with hundreds of acronyms without a previous definition in the text or a glossary at the end.Chapter 4 Fundamental Routing Design should really be the first chapter since it introduces IP and how packets are routed.Buy this book if you need additional reference material on routing protocols. If you are interested in network design: Oppenheimer's Top-Down Network Design or McCabe's book Practical Computer Network Analyis and Design are recommended instead.
5,Best network design book I've seen,"Another very impressive piece of work from Cormac Long. It's detailed, concise, to the point and is delivered in the author's typical ""no holds barred"" style. It brings the reader from the fundamentals of IP planning up to the finer points of advanced topics like OSPF, BGP and the optimization of VLANs and Spanning Tree. An excellent chapter on IP security is also included. This is one I'll keep as a reference for years to come."
1,Very poor fit and finish.,This pounder arrived with the top surface full of scratches. Also where the bottom part of the pounder is attached to the top plate there is seam which on this one was very rough and would easily trap food and dirt. I have returned the item. Did not get a chance to try it out so cannot comment on it's efficiency.
5,Very nice,I teased my wife when she wanted yet another meat mallet. I own several and they work well enough. Now this one is my favorite.It is much heavier than one would expect and that makes it work much better than I would have thought. I frequently use it to pound out chicken breasts for sandwiches and for flattening skirt steak for stuffing.This is what I always use now when I beat my meat.
5,Quality meat pounder,Works great on making chicken breasts flat for picatta. Can grip it easily and has a good heft to it
2,Not the Best,"I do not like this meat pounder. While I usually agree with the assessments from America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated, this time I do not. Before writing this, I went to their site to re-read the review and saw that they had declared this Norpro model the victor from among only five models tested. It IS heavy; it IS well-balanced; it IS easy to grip. However, the jarring force exerted on the cook's hand and wrist at the point of impact is pronounced, and I'm no 90-pound weaking. I can feel it in my bones! A pounder with the weight (and impact) positioned away from the wrist by a longer handle to the side is much easier, more efficient, and I'd guess, much safer to use. This one is OK for smaller projects, like one or two chicken breasts. It causes too much discomfort in the hand and wrist to be used for much more at one time."
5,I want to buy them all.,"Fair price, good weight, and comfortable handle. Does not have a hole in the center which prevents food debris from going in the center like other brands. This is good for sanitary reason. Easy to clean and I like the shiny look. Please save some for me if I need to buy another one later. Parchment paper works great for pounding meat and chicken. I made chicken picatta and used this handy dandy tool. I was the hero for the evening. It is like having Bieber Fever."
5,Nice weight,Much easier to use than the can of beans I was using to pound pork cutlets... Another one of those items recommended by America's test kitchen and I am not disappointed.
2,Does not deserve 5 stars,"The handle on this meat pounder is very short. Even before I used it on meat, I tried it out on a folded kitchen towel. Every time I pounded with any force, my little finger hit the top of the stainless steel disc. I sent it back and will purchase another one designed more like a hammer. I think you get better results with leverage."
4,Looks great,"I haven't used this, but can already tell it will be a huge improvement on my previous, old-fashioned hammer type meat pounder. This is quite heavy and well balanced, and has a large, flat surface area.Meant to update this a long time ago -- works just as expected. The heft and balance make this really easy to use and effective. Takes only a few slaps to flatten a chicken breast."
5,Pound your chicken or pork,"My wife and I have recently hired a chef to come give cooking class parties at our house for a group of friends and two of the chef's recipes called for pounding meat. I have a tenderizing pounder but not a smooth one. This fits the need perfectly! We made pork loins cut in half and pounded thin then lightly breaded and cooked in olive oil with spices. Everything came out fantastic. The pounder did its job without tearing the meat and cleanup was a snap, easy to wash and dry."
5,Perfect weight and size,This is just the perfect weight and size. The metal is slightly rounded under the handle so your hand fits closely to it without smooshing your fingers. We primarily use this to pound out pork and after using this product I wouldn't recommend using anything else.
5,Great meat pounder,"Easy to use and clean, we eat a lot of boneless chicken breasts and wanted a way to even out the meat. This works just as the ads say. Makes stuffing the breasts easy."
4,Meat tenderizer,My son does a lot of cooking and asked specifically for this meat pounder. It tenderizes the meat without putting ridges into it like some meat pounders do. It is easy to use and is well made.
3,Phlueger fly reel,Works fine but I would not buy this product for use in salt water. Even rinsing in fresh water does not prevent salt build up so you can't release the spool to clean or change spools. This build up happens withing half a dozen fishing trips. I've had two of these reels and for about a year and had the same problem with both of themLamson makes a fly reel about the same price that I like the drag better and the spool release.I don't think I'd recommend this product..
2,Too fragile for a Rock 'n' Roller!,"Very cute, worked for a little while, but when it fell off the bathroom vanity, that was that. It never worked again. Not that you should throw your timers around or anything, but I think a timer should be worth at least one fall, don't you?"
2,cute but never worked,was and is super cute but never worked from the day i bought it .. good thing i got it as a shelf sitter anyways
5,awsome Bidet Hyundai HDB - 600,I have wanted one of these for a long time but was susceptible about it I finely purchased one last April I totally love it. I highly recommended this model HDB_ 600 it is very heavy duty to my surprise very well made.What can I say I also have an Hyundai Santa Fe Now Hyundai transports my BUTT and also Washes it.
2,The book is very small,"Hymnal for Contemporary Christians was published in 1973. It has some of the old gospel songs as well as some newer ones written before 1973. I like the idea of a hymns for the contemporary Christian, but this book is entirely too small to use on a piano or organ. The product describes the book as being 7.4x5.7x.03 inches. The book I received is only 6x4x.03 inches. I don't know why I received the smaller version, but I would not recommend this book for anyone planning to use it on a piano or organ because of the size."
4,Excellent album by an incredibly overlooked band,"I discovered this band through the television show The Adventures of Pete & Pete, as ""The Sunburn Song"" was featured in a few episodes. However once the album arrived I discovered that they were much more than just that one song, as this album is full of memorable well crafted songs. As the previous reviewer said it's a pity that more aren't aware of this band."
4,modern mavis,"Mavis is always wonderful.This is her 2nd on Prince's Paisley Park label.It was pretty much ignored ,but I think it's great.Most Prince fans have heard Melody Cool which made me think I would not like this album,but the rest of it ,by my standards is MUCH better.The Undertaker ,the Voice ,A Man Called Jesus+You will Be Moved are outstanding tracks.I like this a little better than ""Time Waits For Noone "" album ,but it's good too,just a lil'mo' AM radio.This is mostly a funkier,edgier Mavis.Stil The Spirit always comes thru!"
4,"Oh, absolutely!","I liked ""Time Waits For No One,"" Miss Staples' 1st Prince-produced album, but this is the one i was waiting for from them! From the bumpin' funk of the title track down to the remake of the ""Lovesexy"" track, ""Positivity,"" they finally gets down to the nitty of the gritty.Digging on the lyrical portion of this album, i sometimes wonder if Prince is psychic or been here before. The lyrics ""the nightsticks are still singing 4 part harmony on brother's backs..."" slightly pre-dated the Rodney King assault. Elsewhere, there is the absolute truth in the words of ""U Will B Moved"" (...when the whip comes down on the back of one of your own/...when you look for compassion but you find you're all alone...), with the silky background help of her dad, Pops Staples. There are definately more highlights to be heard, but i won't be greedy and take up all of your time & space. Just know that this is a beauty of an album worth purchasing (if you can find it), if you appreciate lyrics of substance."
2,Useful information flawed by unpleasant paper and typeface,"I looked at this book in my local bookstore, and couldn't buy it, because it was unpleasant to read. The paper was thin and extremely bright white, while the typeface was too pale. Inserted examples were in Courier type, as if people still use typewriters--these inserts were even more difficult to read. These major flaws made the book unusable to me."
5,The Photoshop Reference,"Real World Adobe Photoshop 6 is without a doubt the best Photoshop 6 book to have if you are serious about learning how to get the most out of Photoshop. The book is comprehensive and well written. If you use Photoshop for daily production of images for print or web use, Real World Adobe Photoshop 6 is one resource you do not want to be without. In addition to the many time saving tips it contains, Real World Adobe Photoshop 6 covers complex topics like color management, selection, unsharpen masking, and color correction in depth in an easy to understand, clear and concise writing style. Although the book is more suited for the intermediate to expert user, new or novice users will also benefit from Real World Adobe Photoshop 6. If you could only purchase one book about Photoshop, Real World Adobe Photoshop 6 by Blatner and Fraser should be that book."
3,Warning: very limited in scope,"I was expecting a complete overview of photoshop techniques. When I did read it, it seemed this book was focused on adjusting color for photos. It is a comprehensive study of the topic, and I learned a great deal about adjusting the color of photos, but a comprehensive walkthrough of photoshop features, it is not."
3,"Read in the library, don't buy",This book leads to more questions than answers. The manner in which this book is written is frustrating.
4,Pretty good. Better then some of the other Popstars bands,"Bardot are more talented then some other Popstars band - namely the UK's Hear'Say, Girls Aloud and One True Voice. They are all untalented with rubbish singles. Bardot actually released a funky, groovy, catchy GOOD song as their debut single.The girls at the time of release were Sally, Tiffany, Katie, Sophie and Belinda. But after Bardot released one album and a few singles, Katie decided to quit the group. The remaining girls went on as a fourpiece and had a few singles, but none were as good as ""Poison"".Bardot themselves probably didn't write this, but I congratulate whoever did. It is a catchy, funky song with naughty lyrics and a catchier then anything chorus. I like the vocals and the music on this.Also on the single you get a non-album track ""Empty Room"" and your usual standard remixes.Overall, a pleasing single that shows that some Popstars bands actually do have talent! (Six, from Irish Popstars also have talent)"
2,as commercial as they come,"The only reason they got 2 stars is because i know that these girls are talented. They managed to make it out of 3000 girls. However, what they have been forced to sing is abysmal! The rocrd company is making no attempt to disguise the fact that Bardot is a manufactured, money-making venture. If these girls were given imput into their music, it would be significantly better. This single merely cements their place alongside other commercial acts such as The Spice Girls and N'Sync"
1,Bland,"The cd cover gets 1 star - just. Put some glossy looking girls together and aim for some short term success. The song itself is bland and theres nothing new in the formula here. Music for the masses...and not even at its best. Directed at a target audience of 11 - 16 year old girls who find this type of music catchy, the audience will grow up and this band will be left without a market and the only memento this song will leave in music history, is that it was performed by Australia's first manufactured female pop group...an experiment i hope that is not repeated anytime soon. Use the money to buy some lollies or bubblegum instead, the pleasure will last longer."
1,Inccorrect Item Displayed,"Bottom line .... It is not the 808-1800 pictured, it is the 808-1801 which is just a simple switch box. The interface has the LCD. Proof for those who want to debate[...]Look at the bottom of page two at the accessories."
1,"Shipped item NOT the item in photo, no display, only an LED","The unit I received only has a switch and green LED, no LCD for battery voltage display, no amps display, no power display. I thought I must have ordered the wrong item and check to see if it worked with my PS1800. It worked but when I checked my order, it was for the unit with full display! So this one is going back."
3,"A Quick and Dirty, Sector-by-sector Analysis of the last Days of the Third Reich","This a quick and dirty, sector-by-sector description of the carnage that took place as the allies closed in on Hitler's Germany, and eventually on his underground bunker.The book begins in January 1945 and takes the reader through to the end of the European part of WW-II. It is a careful chronicling of the unimaginable horrors and suffering that took place in the weeks that followed the end of hostilities. It is a story told only in part in William Shirer's classic ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.""Here, the details are more vivid and the focus is exclusively on the untold barbarism that befell mostly Germany citizens who were left to their own devices after Hitler's armies collapsed. These victims, as had the victims at German hands, endured unimaginable horrors and suffering, mostly by Russian soldiers.An important addition to WW-II history.Three Stars"
4,Interesting Collection.,"Out of the three movies included in this collection, I enjoyed two of them. I didn't care for ""Pat & Mike"". I felt that the movie spends too much time showing Katherine Hepburn playing sports. The two that I did enjoy, ""Woman of the Year"" and ""Adam's Rib"" have more interesting story lines and show Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy at some of their best roles."
1,pass this one completely,"What is the point of making a Tracy and Hepburn collection without including ""guess who is coming to dinner?"". This collection has only 1 ""ownable"" movie; Adam's rib. The rest 2, you can watch once, feel good and forget. But to not include their best movie together (and perhaps one of the most underappreciated gem of all time) is simply infuriating.Do not fall for the cheap tricks of so-called collections. They will mix one good movie with two passable ones. Instead, buy ""Adam's Rib"" and ""Guess Who is Coming to Dinner"" separately and save your hard earned money."
5,Tracy & Hepburn: The Signature collection,The product came in a reasonable time...packaging is great and I gotta say that these classics are some of the best. Tracy & Hepburn at their finest!!!
5,A Must See....,No relationship could transcend to the screen better than that of the Tracy / Hepburn duo. This collection has three times the magic with three of their best movies including the extraordinary bonus DVD for your viewing pleasure.
5,Thanks.,Love this set of films from these great actors. We enjoy watching them. The quality of the discs is great with no problems.
4,Better if you're experienced,"This would be a better piece if you have some experiece with putting such things on. First of all you have to keep in mind that this is meant for a very specific skin type. When I got it it was completely unusable because I am too tanned. I tried to fix it up with more blood and a little foundation, but it still looked too weird. The blood does look very real though, and I did use that to fashion my own wound, but if you don't have pale skin, the wound is going to look very very fake. However, for the right person it would probably be an awesome piece. The wound itself looked pretty cool without applying it."
5,excellent gory wound,"I used this latex wound last year for Halloween. The adhesive worked perfectly and lasted all night through probably about an 8 hour party. Everybody was grossed out by it! The blood is good and goopy and clings to the wound and really makes it look real. I will warn you that the blood that comes with will stain clothing so be careful. A lot of fake blood (the kind you can buy in a spray can) washes out easily, but this blood stained my white shirt color pink. Luckily I picked a shirt that I did not care if it got ruined, and if you use the blood that comes with this, I would recommend the same."
5,Gorgeous and readable book.,"The Sagas of Icelanders is a very large and beautifully made book. The sagas are a great blend of history, historical fiction, and even a bit of mythology. Action packed, character driven reading. These stories read like novels, and they are among the earliest tales written in prose rather than poetry. Book includes lengthy introduction / prologue and commentaries on each saga. I may never finish this book, but there will always be something new there when I want it. Recommended for fans of fantasy novels (although these are realistic tales) and anyone interested in Viking history."
4,Huge Tome,"This book is huge. it's chock full of sagas that present a much different ideal for its heroes than we have in the US. As a myth, these stories create a unique fabric that tells of impossible feats and bizarre characters. This may not be for anyone who isn't interested in this kind of stuff, but it really is some fun stuff. Where else are you going to find projectile vomiting at the same time as a stabbing at the same time as someone recites a poem about the stabbing? Yeah, not anywhere I can think of."
5,ICELAND'S CONTRIBUTION TO WORLD CULTURE,"Roots time for me. I am half Icelandic. People tend to think of the ancient Norsemen as barbaric murderers. Well, they went a-Viking, and you probably wouldn't want to meet them on one of their ""shopping trips"". But the Norse had a rich and complicated culture, their own religion, and some of the most powerful sagas in the world. Icelanders were the scribes and intellectuals. The Icelandic sagas have been compared to the Greek in scope and power. Sample a civilization that's been glossed over by European history. Check out Independent People, by Halldor Laxness, for an example of a modern Icelandic genius' writing."
3,Inaccurate translation,"I bought this as I needed to write an analysis of the ""Soga om Gunnlaug Ormstunge"" for my norwegian exam and, as it is written in 'old norse' I didn't understand word. I read the book and wrote the analysis only to find out that they had failed to translate the AGE of the main character correctly. Femten is not twelve, it's fifteen. This is an important part of the story! I automatically lost all faith in the rest of the translation after that. I might be the only mistake, but when you are relying on a translation..................."
3,It misrepresents the sagas to the novice,"While good as far as it goes, I expected (admittedly somewhat naively) that a book titled, ""The Sagas of Icelanders"" contained all of the icelandic sagas.It doesn't. And aggravating allusions and references now and then to sagas that aren't contained in this volume just compound the frustration. But it does contain a core (to my mind, chosen somewhat arbitrarily) of the sagas from which one can build a familiarity as well as a list for further reading."
4,Have a gallon of water at hand.,"If you want to know about Heathenism, this is a good book. However this book is a very, very, dry read. It's so dry, you might want to sit in some water to read it."
4,"Not quite the UA version, but nice to see nonetheless.","Although not quite what you'd expect if you are familiar with the UA barbarian, the 2nd edition barbarian still fills in a void that the fighter's ""barbarian kit"" just never could fill. Its quite an investment for what many would argue is just a specialized fighter kit, though, so if you're not terribly interested in barbarians (or unfamiliar with the UA barbarian), you might prefer to pass on this book.For those of us who missed ""real"" barbarians, though, this is very welcome. A few things may seem silly, but always remember that the great thing about AD&D is ""house rules"" being a recognized force. Just because the book says something, the DM is always free to modify it to better suit his/her tastes. The ultimate establisher of rules is the DM and his/her playing group. The rest is just a baseline to work from."
3,Frustratingly close to classic status,"The original Unearthed Arcana Barbarian was my absolute favorite class to play. Even the prototype, from Dragon issue 63 was great, even though THAT Barbarian couldn't use ANY magic EVER! However, this book powers down the Barbarian to the point that it starts to look lackluster. Some of the kits are great, and some of the new rules are too, but I longed to see game balance chucked aside for once just so an alley-cleaner of a character class could take the stage. Robert Howard's Conan will just NEVER see the light of day in official AD&D, alas."
3,Nice expansion but ignores tradition,"A very well written book with a lot of good ideas. Unfortunately you'll be hard put to design a character based on your favorite literature or movie barbarian. There's a frustrating limitation on metal weapons, and the kits are original, but don't model some of the classic (or cliche) barbarian characters. A notable exception is the Barbarian Shaman, an original an interesting sub-class. A book with plenty of good ideas, best used a sourcebook for your own designs."
3,"Patchy, florid narrative of the Soviet-American space race","""Space Race"" tells story of the Space Race through parallel biographies of the two great rocket designers Werner von Braun on the American side and Sergei Korolev on the Soviet side.The results are patchy. The narrative is disjointed, the language is florid, and many details of the Korolev story seem merely speculative - but it makes for a racy read. Given these attributes this book may be more appropriate for teenagers or older children. Not terrible but could have been much better."
2,Full of errors,"I agree with the first reviewer, there are far too many technical errors in this book than should be permitted. I worked at Kennedy on Apollo and Gemini, and eagerly read any new book on the space race. It makes me question the accuracy of the Russian side of the story she describes. I have just sent the publisher a list of 29 major goofs."
2,The People Magazine version of the Space Race,"I'd give this book more credit if it's title were, ""The Space Race: The Personalities Behind the Rockets.""But, it's not. It becomes immediately apparent that the author has no interest in the technology of space flight, or of the technical differences and approaches that lay behind U.S. and Soviet developments in spaceflight. Nor is there a good explanation of why the U.S. Apollo program succeeded while the Soviet moon program failed- at least, no technical reason.Because, this book isn't about the technology, it's about the persoNALities. Because everything is, like, y'know, personal.So, if that's what you're looking for then you'll find this book a delight. But if you're looking for a coherent story of how space technologies were developed in the USA and USSR during the Space Race years, you'll surely be disappointed."
5,Crazy Good Food,We changed the food from science diet to Bil Jac about 8 months ago. The dog goes nuts for it and eats it out of the cup as you are pouring it. The dog has much more energy and loved the food. We feed the dog a little less so the extra price is not that much extra. As far as the negative review they must be a rep for Buffalo Blue.
1,"Terribly overpriced, bad dog food","The nerve of some companies to charge $50 a bag for a product chock full of by-products and corn. This food is on the same nutritional level as the Pedigrees of the world which you can get at the local supermarket. If you're on a budget and want to feed your dog a healthier diet, check out Blue Buffalo at Petco, Kirkland's Signature at Costco, Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul and Taste of the Wild online and pet food oriented stores like Pet Food Direct. You owe it to your pets to keep them healthy and you can save money while doing it!"
3,Have some sticking problems...,"These are neat and the kids love them, but what a headache trying to keep the egg or pancake batter from sticking. Have tried just about everything I could think of but nothing works really well. Nevertheless, it was a neat idea and with some effort you can get some good looking eggs/pancakes out of the mold, but probably more effort than I usually want to expend!"
1,Norpro,"I like Norpo, but eggs will stick to this thing like glue. The are not flat, so egg whites will be all over the place."
2,decent but sticky,"We ordered these recently for a project at our childs' preschool. The good: the size was right for a kid to use, the handles worked well so the user didn't get burnt, and it was overall sturdy and useful. The bad: the batter sticks to the mold, so you have to use a knife to cut the half-baked batter away from the mold when you flip it - very awkward, and a little dangerous, and it means the shape comes out pretty messy. We tried spraying cooking spray on it, but that didn't work. And then of course it's awkward to clean since the batter sticks to the metal, even when you soak it, and it's hard to wipe off the inside. So I don't think we're ever going to use these again, which is too bad. So if you use these, maybe try a lot of cooking spray first, or dipping the mold in melted butter first."
1,Maybe for cookies,Not happy with these at all. The batter sticks even after spraying with PAM. Also tried rubbing with oil still sticks. Also they must be filled with so much batter that before you can turn it over the first side burns.
1,I never received this item that I ordered and paid for,I bought this item and was very excited about using it on Sunday mornings when I make pancakes with my son. It never came nor did I get any informatin regard where it may have gone. I would not buy from this seller
5,Great Ensemble of Songs!,"I had this on cassette in the 80s. LOVED it. This is one of those rare albums in which the songs are all good and are organized in a way that they flow well from one song to the other. I thought ""The Best of Al Jarreau"" CD would be a suitable replacement. Although it's good, naturally it doesn't have all the songs from ""High Crime,"" and I miss those songs. Now I need to get ""High Crime"" on CD."
4,Work well for me,"I've read some of the complaints about these bags not sealing well or not staying compressed. I haven't had this problem, although I do find that the built-in zipper really doesn't work well at sealing the zip -- I do it by hand. I've also found that the smaller size bag works better than the large (which seems to take in a small amount of air over time) but I've used both sizes on multiple trips now and they really do allow you to pack a lot more stuff into a suitcase. I took a 7 day trip to Ireland and Spain with just a small carry on bag, packed full of business clothes and casual clothes. I was technically over the weight limit for carry on and was only able to take my bag on board because the airline gave me a break. But that gives you an idea of how much stuff I got in there. I like these and can't imagine traveling without them now. Just bought a second set for my husband."
2,I've owned one of these for more than 20 years. It does not cook eggs accurately.,"Mine had one simple problem: By the time the color changed at all, the eggs were hard boiled. This inaccuracy made it useless to me, and I abandoned its use, it is much better to soft boil by starting with cold water and heating until boiling, then just a few seconds more, the eggs are perfectly soft cooked every time.I loved the idea of this device, being a gadget geek, even though it was analog, and not digital. But first and foremost, a gadget must work. Even if it is harder to use the gadget than the ordinary scheme for doing whatever, the gadget must work."
5,"""Eggs""ceptional",I have used this little egg timer for many years and have always had perfectly boiled eggs. I do not know about the safety of the plastic (as mentioned by another viewer) but it works well for its purpose and dropping it into the hot water seems like the most accurate means for timing an egg.
1,Worked Once,"This egg timer worked well the first time I used it.After that, it just did not work. No color change at all."
5,Best egg timer out there!,"This timer works perfectly every time. I have used all the tried and true methods for perfect hard boiled eggs but none are as consistent and easy as using this product! I love it so much, I bought one for each of my daughters."
5,Most USEFUL little gadget!,"This is one of those inexpensive items that you will wonder how you ever lived without it! This is my second order... my son ""swiped"" the first one I ordered because he did not know when ""the eggs were really done?"" So, I ordered another for myself. It works perfectly and simply every time. Just drop it in the water with your raw eggs and the color change tells you when the eggs are done. Inexpensive and it works... my idea of a perfect product!"
1,"Don't buy this product, containts styrene which is a carcinogen",The strong chemical smell released from this plastic timer is styrene which has been classified by the Department of Natural Health Toxicology department as a carcinogenic. You definitely don't want to use this to feed your family[...]
4,"many ""brands"" of this item","A number of years ago I got one of these types of timers, plus a couple for friends after we liked ours.It is great, no smell when boiling, has worked well.I went to order another and noticed that these days there are 5 or 6 ""brands"" of these things out now; I only recall one, at the time I first found one.Even on Amazon there are multiple manufacturers available.Given the number of offerings, if you are nervous about the Norpro, check the other brands on Amazon-- their reviews don't mention chemical leaching/ smell concerns. I would also be sure to have plenty of water so that you are not inadvertently overheating the plastic.Mine has no such trouble evident, and I have worked with aromatic hydrocarbons for a living- I'd notice it if were present. It is made by HammerHead, and manufactured in the USA."
1,Chemical odor and taste,"I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing. Although this timer really does work, as others have mentioned, it emits a strong chemical odor, apparently due to styrene. I also noticed the eggs took on a strange taste, which I attribute to the egg timer. Boiling eggs from the same carton using the regular method yielded normal tasting results. This egg timer is headed straight for the trash. There is no way I would continue to eat eggs boiled with this timer, let alone let my children! According to the Dept of Health and Human Services National Toxicology Program, styrene is classified as ""Reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen""."
3,Great for cooking eggs but plastic smell makes me wonder...,"I love soft boiled eggs, but mine always used to come out undercooked or overcooked. For the first time in years(!), I've had perfectly boiled soft-boiled eggs. However, there is in fact a plasticky smell - not as bad as some reviews made me think, but I worry nevertheless. I assume that it's not toxic, and if it is, there isn't enough time for the toxicity to penetrate the eggs. However, an assurance from the manufacturer or from Amazon.com would give me peace of mind."
1,stinks,"It works, but the horrible burning plastic chemical smell is reason enough not to use it. Makes a great paperweight!"
5,love this thing!,"I love love love this thing. Plop it in with a spoon when the water begins to boil, then plop in the eggs. PErfect soft boiled eggs almost every time. I say almost because sometimes they get closer to medium... but only because this happens very fast. Gotta be on your toes and get them off the heat. I mean, just sitting in their own heat will take them from soft boiled to medium boiled."
5,Works 100%,"I always wonder about gadgets and if they really work. I saw this (not having any timer at all) and thought I would give it a try. This thing is so cool. I like my eggs between soft and medium. Every single time I have made my eggs with this timer, they have come out perfectly! No one pays me to say this or anything. I am just so amazed by this egg timer, I wanted to write. :)"
4,Norpro Egg Rite Egg Timer,"I must admit that I had doubts that it would work, but, it did. I use it and I like it."
5,Now my friends want one,"It really works! And it's amazingly accurate. It did have a funky smell to the plastic at first when boiling but it didn't effect the eggs in any way (not that boiled eggs smell like roses or anything).Just a pointer on soft-boiled eggs. They should have a runny yolk inside the firm white. Put the eggs in cold water and then bring the water to a boil with the timer already in the water. Soft-boil eggs that are at least a week old or are approaching their expiration date (rather than extremely fresh eggs) are easier to peel. Fresher eggs have less air inside, making them significantly harder to peel successfully. Place the soft-boiled eggs into a bowl of very cold water as soon as you are done cooking them (I put cold water in the pot with ice). The shock of the abrupt temperature change will help make the eggs easier to peel. Leave the eggs in the cold water for 10 minutes.They make for a nice breakfast and supposedly a runny yolk is much better and healthier for you."
4,Perfect eggs every time as long as you watch the timer.,"This timer changes color as the eggs cook. If you stop boiling the eggs when the timer is completely red, you'll have perfect eggs. You do have to check the timer color periodically so it's not like you can go off and do other things and wait for a beep. It's great if you're going to be in the kitchen doing other prep anyway, but if you want to be able to go away and no exactly when to take up the eggs you can't do that. An audible indicator when the eggs are done would make this perfect."
4,"Works very well, make sure you keep it in the fridge","Have been very pleased with the effectiveness of this little gadget. My family enjoys soft boiled eggs and also hard boiled eggs, so now I can be sure I am making what I intend to.I had no issues with the bad smell that others have had. As some other reviews said, it's hard to read through the boiling water. But, if you turn the heat off after the water reaches boiling your eggs will continue to cook and you'll be able to read the timeer with no problem.Sometimes, I make eggs in my food steamer instead of boiling water and this littl t works there, too.I did realize, later, that I needed to keep this in the fridge so that it would be the same temperature as the eggs starting out. I am sure that the package said to do that, but, being a guy, I don't read instructions very often."
1,WHAT A JOKE,It is hard in polite language to express how unbelievably BAD this product is ! It absolutely did not work remotely as well as advertised.A total waste of time and money.What a joke - and the joke is on the consumer !
2,Not really useful,"Hard to read egg when cookingit really loses its functionality, dont waste your timeused mine once, never used it again"
3,Possible cause for smell???,I have not bought this yet but the smell may be due to the bottom of the pot conducting right into the timer. The egg only contacts the bottom of the pot in a very small area so direct conduction from the burner to the pot to the egg is not a problem. The plastic egg timers I have seen have a flat bottom so the heat from the burner goes right into the timer. Maybe add a colapsable strainer
1,rip off product,"this product is a rip off, it smells of burning melting plastic when you put it in the pot of water w/ eggs. I was afraid the chemicals would leach into my kids eggs."
1,"Works,but smells terribly!","It does give you the true readings,but smell coming from the pan was terrible. I'm not going to use it again,don't think that perfectly done eggs worth the risk for my health. Money wasted!"
2,"Works, but not long",As other reviewers said - it smells badly in hot water but works great. After about 8 times i've used Norpro Egg Rite Egg Timer its color in cold stage had change a bit and plastic begin to split in half
3,Works,Edit June 2011:After using this product for over a year the slicker on the bottom pealed a bit so water gets into it and it does not show the the mark correctlyWorks just like it supposed to. Shows when the eggs are soft medium or hard :)
5,This is a MUST HAVE!,"The best egg timer ever invented, period. I cook eggs every day, and this handy little gadget is, amazingly, as good as advertised. I'm going to buy one for everyone I know."
1,Worthless for very soft-boiled eggs,I can't really see the lines when it's boiling. It's especially hard to tell if you want a very soft-boiled egg. The chemicals leaching into the water and into the porous eggs is also a concern. I was thinking about cooking my organic eggs with such a potentially harmful product. What was I thinking?! Sending for a refund.
1,a waste of money,"I was really looking forward to getting this egg timer but it's a disappointment. Eggs were supposed to be hard-boiled, but they were decidedly medium - a big mess. I'm not sure I'll use this thing again."
2,Not So Good,"Since I consistently overcook my eggs, I bought this as a visual aid. I figured it would be foolproof. It works perfectly as advertised, with one major flaw. When it is heated up in the pan with my eggs, the pan, eggs and water smell like burning acrylic. If you are finicky, as I am about the smell of my food, then pass on this, and use an old fashioned timer."
1,Great...While It Lasted,"When I first bought this handy little gadget I didn't know how I had ever lived without it. After using it about 15 times however, I removed it from the pot to discover it had split completely in half along a line where it had been fused together. I had bought one for my mom as well and her's did the same thing about two months later. Very dissapointing..."
1,Tried it but will not use is again!,"I was stunned that something used for cooking can produce such horrible plastic stink. I have little kids and with all the fuss about BPA this is definitely a candidate for some more research what happens to one using this timer. I will get a good olf fashion clock with a ring. The timer also does not make a sound so you have to watch the eggs and ""enjoy"" the stink. Norpro what are you thinking??"
3,Weird plastic smell,It does work and you dont have to worry about green eggs anymore. But as the plastic egg is boiling there is a strong chemical/ plastic smell in the kitchen that's kind of scary. I hope Im not eating any strange chemicals.
2,The plastic smell is pretty strong,"At the recommendation of a friend who had used one of these for years I found these online and bought 4 of them: one for my friend, one for me, one for my dad, and one for my sister.The first time we used the timer I got a headache from the plastic fumes smell. My husband did the next batch of eggs when I was out of the house and told me that the air still filled with the smell of burning plastic.The eggs don't taste like the plastic smell, but I really hesitate to continue use of this gadget given the impact on my air quality and the worry about what it's dumping into the cooking water."
5,Greatest Tool under $10.00,"This is without a doubt the greatest tool under $10.00I have been plagued with a pallet that craves soft boiled eggs. I tried every timing technique I could come up with. I tried to have the water boil first, place the eggs in and wait 6 min I tried keeping the eggs off the bottom of the pot... you name it I tried it.With this gadget I literally place the eggs in the water with the Egg Timer and continue with my day.You will not believe how perfect your eggs will be after using this little gizmo. I am rarely 100% satisfied with a product, this one has done it!"
5,"Amazing, no more undercooked boiled eggs!",This is simply amazing. I have used it with both Jumbo and Medium eggs and they come out perfect every time. I never even knew these existed until I was looking for a filler item for the buy 3 get 1 free kitchen sale and when I came across this I knew I had to give it a try. My husband eats a low carb diet so he eats lots of boiled eggs and egg salad. I kept under and over cooking the eggs and was very frustrated. Timing the eggs by the cookbook just wasn't cutting it. This has easily paid for itself since I no longer have to throw out undercooked boiled eggs!
2,"Does what it's supposed to do, but STINKS.","As other reviewers have noted, this product is made of polystyrene and really does emit a HORRIBLE stench when boiled. Polystyrene is a substance that is used to make plastic cutlery and food packaging. It has been determined ""food safe"" by the FDA. However, when I used this timer the first time, and removed the lid from the pot of eggs, the smell of the polystyrene in the steam literally made me woozy. I immediately removed the timer and soaked the eggs in clean, fresh water. The eggs, even when cooled, refrigerated and peeled, never smelled like eggs. They had completely absorbed the strong chemical smell all the way through. I didn't even bother to taste them. I don't care what the FDA says, this can't be good for you.I gave the product 2 stars, because it does exactly what the manufacturer says it does. Also, our dear FDA claims the polystyrene is safe. Sadly, I have my doubts and will therefore not be consuming eggs boiled with this timer."
3,Excellent Timer (but with chemical odor),"This little egg timer really does the job! You can trust the indicators to yield the right amount of time for cooking. The only thing negative about it is that once it's heated up, it gives off a highly chemical smell into the water, which makes you wonder if any of this is penetrating the eggs and perhaps toxic on some level. Curious if anyone's looked into this or tested?"
5,"I want my, I want my, I want my DVD!","This concert I have loved for so long. It is incredible. The extended versions of the songs are AWESOME, especially the new part in Sultans. Mark Knopfler is GOD.WHEN ARE THEY - IF EVER - GOING TO RELEASE THIS ON DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????"
2,Mp3 is not the original release version,"I loved the original lp and wanted a digital version, in particular ""Tunnel of Love"" which is just an amazing live recording. So imagine my shock listening to the mp3, everything seems fine until I get to ""Tunnel of Love"" and it is not the Alchemy original recording but some inferior bootleg version with the crowd noise up front. It's not a compelling version and it runs 11:52 whereas the original is 14:34. Very strange that just that one track was switched. Also the mp3 includes ""Love over Gold"" which was not part of the original release but was a b-side to ""Solid Rock"". Nice addition but clearly someone cobbled this together. The sound quality is noticeably different for these two tracks to the rest."
5,Needs a few more tunes for perfection,I agree with all the reviews this is a must have. Hopefully in the future Mark Knopfler will approve a rerelease with Industrial Disease and Twisting By the Pool. This would complete the show. Also they could add It Never Rains as a bonus track which was included early in this tour.
2,Alchemy mp3 album-disappointing audio quality,"Having seen some of the concert on youtube, I was really excited to have found the album but the audio quality of this mp3 album is quite disappointing. There is a hum throughout many of the songs and the sound is generally distorted."
2,Don't be fooled.,"If you're familiar with this album then you know it's a 5 star record. If you're not then you should get it on disc. I spent a lot of hours listening to these songs and trying to get some of those leads down on my own. So I know it well enough to tell beyond a doubt that the version on Amazon's MP3 of Tunnel of Love is not the version that's on the original album. I know that's totally geeky but shame on Amazon for not labeling it accurately and for replacing one track with an inferior cut. What's one song, right? A lot if you know what you're missing. Now to ask for my money back and buy the disc. Wish me luck. What can I say? Don't fall for the easy download and just get the discs. You'll be happy you went that route."
4,On The Night Rocks This Dosen't,"I'll say this is a pretty good live CD from Dire Straits, itis not ranked their best though but it is good. On the Night isa better live CD first of all because you can bang harder. Myfavorite song from this collection is Tunnel of Love which isgreat becuase it is 14 mintues long."
3,Plastic lunch bags,"With CD jewel cases being very inexpensive to buy, I have no idea why a seller would ship CDs in plastic lunch bags."
3,What's the fuss all about?,"After reading all the reviews about Dire Strait's Alchemy CD maybe I expected too much. However this isn't the greatest ""live"" set ever recorded! Although there are certainly highlights overall it seems Mark Knopfler and the boys have fallen into the same trap that groups like Yes did before them. Believe me, longer is not always better. This version of Sultans isn't bad, it's actually pretty good. By far, though, the best song on this CD is Tunnel of Love. It sounds fresh from the beginning where Sultans sound like the group was getting bored with having to play it. I would recommend this if you're a die-hard DS fan, otherwise don't bother."
2,"Best Tunnel Of Love Ever, Thus Only Good Song","I think this version of Tunnel of Love is really great! It is a little over 14 minutes. The song starts out with Mel Collins on saxophone, then the opening intro, then quiet for a minute, then the real intro (The Carousel Waltz). It just rocks your ass thewhole way into the song. This Live Version of Tunnel Of Love JustROCKS!!! One you want to play 2 times. Other than that the rest of the CD is ok, but certainly lame. I can't stand these annoyingclaps, and screaming thus On the Night dosen't. That means this and BBC is junk Dire Straits. Why do everyone like this recordso much? They either like this, OR BROTHERS IN ARMS. Anyway. Thisis definately not Dire Straits at their best. I will give this CD2 stars because I love this version of Tunnel of Love and this version totally ROCKS! Just buy it for that. Go buy On the Night & the studio albums insted."
1,The Animal Soundtrack,The CD was a pitiful excuse for the great songs in the movie--a total waste of money.
4,Do It Yourselfer's Compressor,"This is a compressor for the serious Do-It-Yourselfer. Bought one several months ago and have used it for some remodeling projects. It's oil-less, meaning low maintenance, but requires a dedicated electrical source. I ran the Porter Cable 350 framing nailer, Senco SFN40 finish nailer, and a Porter Cable brad nailer, and haven't had any problems yet. The protective cage works well and is well balanced. It is a bit on the heavy side, and it's loud, so wear ear plugs if you're running it in an enclosed area."
5,What a work horse,"I have had nothing but good experiences with this compressor. It has far exeeced my expected capabilities. I have used it to run all types of nail guns, impact wrenches and other air tools. It has perfromed flawlwessly. The only drawback I have seen to date is that it uses more amps than others in its class--a trade off I am willing to make. This is probably due to the fact that its CFM rating exeeds all the others as well. I would recommend this air compressor to anyone in the need for a small air compressor that performs as good as may air compressor twice as large. By the way, it is not as loud as some seem to think it is."
2,Bacon Press,"I don't really like this Bacon Press. It's not the greatest thing.It's easily rust,even greased, awkward to use, and doesn't fit any size frying pan well. It stays in my cabinet."
4,Need evenly cooked bacon?,"We cook tremendous quantities of bacon (because it is the only source of protein that one of our sons will eat). Our son insists that the bacon be extra extra crispy (if it will bend, he won't eat it) therefore a bacon press is a necessity.Pros:1. Wooden handles stay cool2. Heavy enough to do their job very effectively.3. Bottom surface flat enough that they can be used on non-stick surfaces (unlike some others that have decorative ridges that make cleaning difficult and chew up non-stick surfaces).Cons:1: As with all cast iron cooking items, special care needs to be taken when washing to prevent rusting.2. ""Textured"" bottoms make cleaning more difficult than it needs to be (but I haven't found any bacon presses with perfectly flat bottoms).3. We cook on a large electric griddle and an extra inch or two in length would increase their effectiveness a great deal. If you are cooking in a frying pan or small griddle they are probably sized correctly."
4,Info is wrong,"I received these April 13, 2010. The picture on the bottom is not the ""Little Piggie"" (as is shown), it is a 3/16"" checkerboard pattern. The actual dimensions are 4.25"" x 8.25"". I haven't used them yet, so can't comment on performance myself; I'll just go along with those who have used them and do an update if I disagree."
1,Didn't work as expected...,"I tried this press how I assumed it was supposed to be used. When I tried pressing a pig with it, nothing happened. I'm still trying to find an easier way to turn them to bacon."
3,Good and bad,"A bacon press helps tremendously when fighting curling bacon. This one has a design on the bottom, which is attractive, but food particles get caught in it and make it impossible to clean. I have used mine for several years and no amount of scrubbing, even with wire pads, will get food particles from the cracks. A plain bottom would be more functional and healthier."
2,"Only 6 1/2"" in length","It is only 6 1/2"" in length. I thought it would be longer since bacon is cut approx. 10"" so you have to keep moving it around. The weight is good."
3,Better to know now....,"Had I read this more carefully, I would have not purchased. About 1/2 the size of a normal strip of bacon. Product works great for preventing curling, however. Would have preferred now to get the other bacon press that is the full size of a strip of bacon (or closer to) for better coverage."
1,WORTHLESS!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS SO CALLED BACON PRESS IS AN ABSOLUTE PIECE OF JUNK!!!!IT IS SO LIGHTWEIGHT YOU MAY AS WELL NOT EVEN BOTHER TO USE IT,IN FACT I DON'T.THE TITLE OF MY REVIEW SAYS IT ALL .IT IS NOT WORTHY OF 1 STAR BUT THAT IS THE LOWEST RATING YOU CAN GIVE."
2,not used very much,Since I cook a lot of bacon at a time this product is really too small to benefit all the bacon..it does however work well with a few pieces at a time.I'm pretty sure I heard on the news that Amazon stopped funded ALEC; if true it was the right move in my opinion.
2,adequate for holding down a few strips of bacon,"Sufficient for keeping a little bit of bacon flat, weight is good and wooden handle stays cool enough. I wish it was bigger, but it works well enough on a griddle, grill or skillet."
2,Insufficient product information,"Amazon does not provide enough information about this Press. I do not like this press because it is too large for my 10"" frying pan and Amazon do not provide dimensions. Now I have to make a decision to either go through the hastle of returning it, or grinding off the corners.Secondly, I expected the Press had a smooth bottom from the picture shown. I didn't realize until the item arrived that there is a second picture showing the ""Bacon Press"" bottom that is not readily apparent.Thirdly, the product box does not show the manufacturer's address or contact information which is usually a RED flag that a product is second rate."
3,norpro cast iron grill press,I like it ..but wish I had gotten a larger one..maybe later I will purchase a larger one..rightr now I get along okay with this one
2,Smaller than a slice of bacon,Decent product if you're looking for something to dress up the kitchen but way too small to be of much effect actually pressing full size bacon. This is more like a item you would pick up at a Cracker Barrel souvenir stand.
3,Not the real Lady Grey - look for black box,"This tea does not have the signature Lady Grey citrus flavor. Buy the blue tin loose tea instead or look on Amazon/eBay for the 50 or 100 count black box sold in the UK. There is also a black tin loose tea, also only available in the UK. You can order the black versions from Twining UK online store, but DHL delivery starts at $20."
5,really good tea,"the flavor and the strenght is just right when you want a cup of real English tea in the evenings. Love it. Gave some to my friends and now they are all ""hooked"" on it too ."
5,my favorite in the world,"Love this stuff, have a cup every morning at work (my reward for showing up to work) puts a smile on my face every time"
5,Wonderful Tea,"This is a really nice, refreshing, and relaxing tea. I love having this after dinner. The light, citrus flavor is perfectly blended. This is a tea that I always have on hand."
4,Easy way to get tea,"Amazon is always a reliable source for my tea, no matter where I am in the world. I just wish I could get it shipped directly instead of through a third party. Still, it's nice to have this option to get my tea."
3,Blue vs Red Lady Grey Tea,I ordered Twinings Lady Grey Tea 7/20/2011 for my niece. I was disappointed as I just learned it was not Lady Grey Twinings Tea that came in the red package. When I placed the order I was sure this is what I was ordering. Could you inform me is it available at all? I notice now it is not shown at all on your pages. The blue package is ok but I do prefer the tea in the red package. Recently a friend brought some back from her trip to London. Thank you.
1,Like Pine-Sol,I like the other flavors but this one is a no go ... just my personal take... aromatic like a floor cleaner. sorry not for me
4,Lady Grey Tea,"Love this tea and the subtle citrus taste, can't praise it enough as I am a tea drinker. This is my favorite!"
5,Twinings Lady Gray Brightens Up My Day,Lady Gray Tea starts and ends my day.It gets me going in the morning and soothes my evening.It has a hint of something special that makes it a Lady's Cup of Tea.
5,Great find.,This product is nowhere to be found in grocery store. I love and the order was processed very quickly.
5,Great looking and functional caddy,"So far so good. This caddy is very clean and elegant looking. A little pricey for a shower caddy, but worth the money. The baskets are adjustable and generously sized. Good product."
1,Is it just me?,"I have a pretty average bathtub/shower arrangement, with an average height ceiling. As a result, I ended up throwing this caddy away because I don't have a metal saw, and I found that the caddy skips over all the useful heights to all the ones that you don't need. Maybe this one will work for your bathroom, but unless you like returning items through the mail, I wouldn't chance it."
4,Rust Free Shower Caddy,I have only had this product for a month so not sure about rust free advertisment. It does bow in the middle but has a very nice look.
4,A little shaky,Has not rusted so far which is better than the other one we had. As reported in other reviews it is bowed. It is also a little shaky when you pull items off. I don't feel it will fall but could use a re-design.
3,"Decent CD, a little disappointing","I downloaded this CD back in 02, I had the best tracks on one of my mixed cd's. I was listening to it and decided to buy the whole CD! It wasn't a good idea since there was really nothing that impressed me besides those 4 or 5 bangers he had!"
5,sweet,"this is a hot CD, i first bought it for bakardi slang. But some of his other tracks have outdone it. I must say some tracks were not so good, but thats what its like now, most albums have only 1 or two good tracks. He is going to be huge.WATCH OUT"
2,Pleasant surprise. . .,"I'm not much of a hip-hop head anymore, I primarily listen to dancehall and r&b, and the only reason that I bought this album was because I heard the hook on a song called Money Jane and it sounded a lot like Sean Paul. And it was. I gotta admit that this cd is not bad for me at all. Its straight rap most of the time, which I don't like, but the dancehall balance is kinda cool. Gotta little Capleton tie too talking about the Fire like he does."
2,I expected alot more from this album,"I first heard Kardinal on his single ""Bakardi Slang"" and I must say I was really impressed. And after I heard ""Husslin"" I was convinced Kardinal was a diamond in the rough. Well after playing this whole CD through all I can say is I am dissapointed for several reasons. The first one is Kardinal seems to copy many other MC's both lyrically and topic wise, and most of his beats fall extremely short. It's too bad, he is a very talented MC, probably one of the best out of Canada, but he just couldn't resist screwing up this debut album. Maybe next time Kardinal..."
3,criminally underrated,Not all of the tracks are good but most are and there aren't any that areunbelievable !!but Kardi is a very solid MC with a good voice and flows. It's a shame that he has never gotten his due credit in the US.
3,"Ideal for Lagos, Nigeria",This is ideal for places like Nigeria where there are frequent blackouts especially for businesses which must use electricity to power their office equipment and in homes as well.
4,KiN u StaND Da GaMe?,"Pastor Troy has put out a solid piece of work with Face-Off. I really wasn't into him too much untill I heard ""This Tha City"", which by the way is one of the best songs you'll ever hear. Usually I don't buy Cd's after listening to just one song but this was an exception, and I wasn't dissapointed. Troy holds it down for the South 100%. Among the better songs on the CD are ""Can You Stand the Game"" and ""Oh Father""."
4,DSGB,This Cd would have gotten 5 stars but he has some of his old songs on there.1. Face Off (Intro)2. This Tha City- tight beat hit single on the album3. Frame Me- tight beat dissing cops4. My N***as Is The Grind- wit nature boy5. Move To Mars6. I'm Made- tight7. Can You Stand The Game slow song for the women8. Throw Your Flags Up feat. DSGB real fi9. Vica Versa- hit single feat. Lil Pete10. No Mo Play In GA- hit single repping GA 2 tha fullest11. Rhonda- basically saying stay tru 2 yo nigga12. Eternal Yard Dash-on his old CD13. Prayer- skit14. Oh Father- repenting on all of his sins
5,Cool,"This is by far one of his best cd's and his first cd he released with Universal Records. Every song is tight with the classic songs ""Help Me Rhonda"", ""Vica Versa"", and ""No Mo PLay in GA"" on the cd"
3,An Easy Read,"A readable account of Dien Bien Phu, of interest primarily to the general reader; military history fans will probably find it too skimpy on issues of strategy and tactics, as well as on other matters (for instance, the author makes no effort to reconcile the widely divergent accounts of the performance of non-European troops; or, there is no serious assessment of de Castries as commander -- not only the murky business of his 'withdrawal', but also the unquestioned assumption that he was unsuited due to his training as a cavalry officer).The book provides almost no general background; the reader who is not familiar with the history of French Indochina may find this a major problem. If that is not an issue, then the wealth of personal details Simpson provides will make it an easy and interesting read."
4,A fine introduction to the battle of Dien Bien Phu,"This is probabaly the best book you can find of the battle of Dien Bien Phu if you want to have a complete picture of that important struggle of 1953-54, without spending many days studying the massive and more authoritative volumes of Fall and Windrow. The author has personal knowledge of the Indochina and knew most of the protagonists by first hand. He also had the chance to interview General Giap in 1991 and also to study the archives of the French Army and the French Foreign Legion. The story flows like a novel, the details are excellent and not at all boring and the suspence excellent although you know the end. The only drawback is the absence of detailed maps with olny two of them to show the whole of Indochina in 1954 and the French strongpoints in the Dien Bien Phu valley. The author has included instead some nice b/w photos which are very useful fot younger readers to catch the spirit of the era."
4,Why We didnt Learn From the French,Read this Along W/Bernard Falls Hell in a Very small place. And you will have more Questions Who lost Vietnam. In order to not follow the Mistakes Of others You have Identify thier mistakes and Make sure you dont make the same Mistakes. Did we Under estimate our enemy.
2,Don't eat the popcorn,"This is really a cartoon. The characters are caricatures without any depth, and the story line is beyond silly. The roaches have most of the good lines, delivered staccato-fashion so that it's hard to pick them up, just the thing for repeat and cult viewers. Amid the Loony Toons slapstick there are some good sight gags and some diverting hijinks. Mercifully, the roaches are not quite as disgusting as possible.Jerry O'Connell plays a Wayne's World kind of sweet guy who spends a lot of time on his back surrounded by the Lilliputian roaches who even tie him down. But he gets the girl, the beautiful and talented Megan Ward, who has little to do other than mug, which she does very prettily.Nonetheless there is a strange pull to this loser-ID flick: perhaps it is a metaphor for the world in which we live, surrounded by filth and the ever-present reminder that cockroaches will inherit the earth."
1,4 1/2 stars? What are you guys on?!,"This movie was represented best by roaches because it's about as vile and annoying as that bug.If you're looking for side-splitting laughs and even a little T&A; you've come to the wrong place. I think I chuckled twice through the whole movie. That's it. Those roaches were d**m annoying. I would have torched the entire apartment building just to kill those sons of b**ches.Anyway, this movie is boring, stupid, not funny and the roaches were lame. Oh, yeah, the ""acting"" sucked too. I'm glad Jerry Connelly is actually doing something worthwhile now. I might have given this movie more stars if the girl actually got naked but nope."
2,Eh... whatever.,"The movie itself is pretty goofy. It's cartoonish and juvenile; in fact, the entire story is more like a fairy tale (especially the over-the-top ending) than any type of believable motion picture.I rented Joe's Apartment solely because the members Rockapella (at the time) are in the roach chorus. The songs are hysterical, but don't expect to recognize any voices, because the recording is sped up a la ""The Chipmunks."" Still, it's interesting enough...Actually, I think that the story idea minus the roaches might be a more entertaining movie. The opening scene (multiple bus station muggings) was hysterical and led me to believe the movie would be a lot hipper than it was. I guess it's hard to build a credible story around anthropomorphized bugs.Still, if you have a few hours to kill and nothing else is available, this isn't the worst movie ever. And if you're a Rockapella fan, it's worth it just to see the guys' names in the closing credits."
5,I have a new respect for roaches,"The official sounding fellow who wrote that professional review above is really quite sensitive. I bet he rarely goes camping where real bugs like these crawl around. I also bet that his gutless review won't stand up to the test of time. Future generations will recognize this movie as a gem for sure. As for myself, I didn't find either the bugs nor the human actors to be less than what was necessary to make me laugh endlessly. This movie is a sleeping classic for sure. Geeze, the modern Y2K people of today watch T.V. shows like the 'Fear Factor', where they make beauties eat roaches for cripes sake. Now that is gross!"
4,Joe's Apartment,"This was a totally cool movie, I loved the special effects, but not the language. I wish producers would realize that vulgarity isn't necessary. I laughed a lot."
3,Silly...mindless...cute,Great effectsdown to the opening strains of Mel Torme turning into the cockroach (that a lot of critics thought he was :> ) Inventive yet so overly silly one isn't sure if the nausea comes from the bugs or the sappy script...still all in all a cute film with some really cute bugs
1,Beware,"Beware of Amazon misrepresentation for this movie. IMDB says ""Joe's Apartment"" was released in theatrical format (Widescreen in DVD terms). Amazon is representing for sale a 2005 release of this DVD in 5:3 (1.66) Widescreen. However, I have been sent a cropped (Full Screen) version (from the ""Seller"" Amazon represents as selling the DVD in Widescreen) and Amazon says they can't replace it with the represented Widescreen DVD I ordered. No choice but to return it for a refund."
3,Joe's Apartment - A Goofy Movie,"I never knew it could be so fun to hang out with cockroaches, It's changed my life!The Sweet Smell of ASH in the Morning: The Pocket Edition"
1,"shoddy collection, cashing in on popularity","This book didn't really live up to the potential that it could have had. I ordered this book sight unseen because of my long-standing interest in the world of geisha; i've read a number of other books on the subject and am always piqued when a new one comes up on my radar, so to speak. However, this book just didn't deliver, in my opinion. The slim volume was half composed of pictures which didn't seem to be arranged in a particular order; also, potential readers should be aware that some of the pictures from woodblock prints contain rather adult material, one or two being quite graphic.This book didn't do enough as either a written resource or as a pictorial one. If you want factual information on the subject coupled with plenty of photography, see _Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance and Art_ by John Gallagher or _Geisha_ by Kyoko Aihara instead."
1,Very Unhappy,This program is nothing but some instruction and discussion of pre algebra and algebra. It claims there is practice tests and activities. The only thing that is anything like that are some printable sheets of equations. No activities anywhere and nothing interactive in the whole thing accept turning the pages while the instructor and a student talk!!!
1,Waste of money!,"The CD wouldn't work, and I tried it on two different computers, one with an XP operating system, one with Vista. This is a horrible product. I know it's cheap, but you might as well throw that money away!"
4,Hitachi EC12 2-Horsepower Air Compressor,"Overall a great compressor. I have taken it everywhere, on roofs, in fields, in basements, run it off a generator, used it for almost everything you could use a compressor for, and it keeps on going. Nailing (framing and finishing) , small paint jobs with a cup gun or pressure pot, air chisle, air ratchet, air wrench, you name it.As with the other reviewers, the guages are the weak link in this unit. Too exposed and too fragile. My only actual complaint ( and why it only got 4 stars) it that it won't start when it gets cold. Here in Michigan, it can be 65 degrees one day, and 35 degrees the next. I have to carry a propane heater on the truck to warm up the compressor so it will run. Once it cycles a few times and builds up it's own heat, it is fine unless it cools off again. It seems like whenever it get around 45 degrees or lower, it won't start. If anyone has any suggestions, I am sure we all would appreciate it. (firemike1016@twmi.rr.com)"
3,Great in warm weather,This thing is great unless you are trying to start it in cold weather. It pops the breaker over and over until it warms up enough for the motor to keep running. I just use it around the house but if you were on a job site in cold weather it would be a problem.
1,"Very loud, and died early","First, as other reviewers say, this particular compressor is *very* loud. It seems like it could be quieter. Second, I find that in any moderate tool use, it cycles quite frequently...maybe a higher SCFM would be better.Most importantly, this has to be the least overworked tool in my weekend remodeler's arsenal, yet it's the first one I've ever actually had die. I've owned it for maybe 4 years, but it only gets used a couple times a year. I took care of the oil, always drained the tank, and never kicked it over or dropped it. Yet recently the pressure control switch has failed. Now whenever it charges up, after the switch cuts off at max pressure, some sort of relief kicks in and bleeds off all the pressure it just built up. Useless. I could fix this for about $60 by buying a new one on the Internet, but I'm not happy with the quality so I'm going to switch brands.Maybe low quality is why this thing is discounted so much."
1,Not real happy,"I bought this after looking at the specs, It will not deliver what it says. I have the same problem of it cutting off on the safety valve. If I use mine for any length of time it will trip the overload. I would recommend another brand..."
1,Shipping Problems,"Didn't get to test the Hitachi. I was amazed how little packing/protection is provided in the box for the compressor. I opened the box and was rewared with a lot of little plastic pieces that once were the air filter assembly. Since there does not appear to be a way for replacement parts to be sent to me, I will return the compressor without use."
1,CAUTOIN!!!! CHEAP SAID MADE IN CHINDA,"Well first when UPS droped off untied the plastic it said on unit MADE IN CHINA, Then when I lifted out of bag I saw pieces of what looked like pot metal in the bottom of bag, What happen was that someone sit it down to hard, busted the motor and compressor from the frame, Metal looked about 1/16"" thick,plus free shipping took 13 days to arrive.Sent back refunded money back all except $9.99 so it cost me $10.00 to wait 13 days to get a china made busted compressor. But it was a blessing in disquise, went and bought a CRAFTSMAN."
1,Horrible warranty service from Hitachi and Amazon,"We sent the Ec 12 in for repair after only six months of use, on April 12. They still have not repaired or returned the compressor. Hitachi rep for the NW said that is the best they can do. Be prepared for the big company attitude and the I dont care people, and the hundreds of hours on the phone trying to get an answer.Buy something else and from a direct retailer. Amazon will not honor exchanges."
4,Good Compressor,"This compressor feels very sturdy. It came with one of its' feet bent and I felt the packaging could be better. It has worked well so far. The compressor is heavy because it is mostly metal. It works well, comes with compressor oil but you'll need to buy some quick couplings and teflon tape.I've had this for a few years now and it has served me well. I've used a framing nailer to built 2 sheds with it, I powered a finish nailer to install trim in my house and I used it to remodel my kitchen.Worked great so far.The only downside is the weight (which is really not bad when compared to other compressors) and some parts such as the regulator is cheaply made."
4,great for a while,"I am a general contractor and have put my EC12 through the worst of it. It runs well for quite a long time but around the two three year mark it starts haveing problems. first off the gadges start sticking and give inaccurate readings. Second if it's cold it has troble rolling over, sometimes if it's below frezeing it will just sit there and hum untill a circuit blows. Third, even if you fix the gadges, the auto shut off stops working and it just keeps running untill you notice the line over pressure valve dumping (not easy on a loud site, I noticed after someone else asked me why it had been running for 10 minets). The repair shop can only temperaraly fix these problems, they usualy come back in a cupple weeks. But mind you, I usually have it on for nine hours a day mon-fri and sometimes on sat, I think it might hold up better for someone who didn't use it full time."
1,Disappointing Hitachi quality,"I bought a like-new Hitachi EC12 compressor from a fellow woodworker. I encountered the following problems.1. The pressure regulator leaks air. You can hear the air leak when the working pressure is set below 90psi. At higher working pressure, the leak is not as noticeable. It also seems that Hitachi uses non-standard thread as standard 1/4"" hex nipple does not fit. I had to reuse the hex nipple came with the unit.2. The unit does not hold pressure. Over a 12-hour period, it lost about 20 psi of air. I have noticed the unit will refill the tank periodically even though it is not being used.3. The unit fails to run sporadically. The motor makes a humming sound but the compressor will not kick in. The motor will stop in a few seconds and the same cycle will repeat every few seconds. The only way to get the unit working again is to cycle the AUTO/STOP switch.I am really disappointed by the quality of this Hitachi air compressor."
1,Disappointing,"Had this unit for about three years with very light use - occasional tire inflation. As a previous writer indicated, the gauges got stuck, the pressure release valve froze, it wouldn't start and turned out to be uneconomical to repair. Basically, as other reviewers on other sites stated...its a piece of junk - Stay away"
1,Do not buy this unit,"I am not a daily user, but I wanted something for the occasional nailing work. Other than the fact that it is too heavy and noisy for its features, the quality was poor. First, the pressure regulator broke. I took it out and went around it, and then I started having electrical problems - the unit would not kick in and re-fill unless I played with the switch. Last time I am buying Hitachi - This is a low quality unit. They should be ashamed."
2,2 pathetic things,"What would have been a great compressor (aside from regulator placement) is spoilt for me by 2 things: 1) for about $1.50 a muffler could have been put on to reduce noise by 25-30 dB (to less than 1/4?) and 2) the unloader valve that is supposed to relieve pressure from the cylinder head after the compressor cycles off is poorly designed. When it fails, the motor has to try & start with the head under pressure, which mostly it cannot do. This is also likely to burn out the motor. This same thing may also be the cause of all the poor starting in cold weather etc. I have a simple fix. If you (or Hitachi Co.) want it, email paul@pthompson.com I have since bought 2 Makita 3.5hp compressors, and now having fixed this I shall probably sell it."
2,good but delicate,"The are a few downsides to this heavy compressor. It is very loud. Although most of it is made of cast iron or metal there are several key components that are made of delicate plastic. Such as the components nearthe regulator, which include the on/off switch. And the filter housing. There is nothing wrong with them being pastic but if you transport your compressor regularly in the back of your truck, then you can count of them breaking almost everytime and the compressor stops working soon after that. If your compressor stays in your garage then this is okay. But for twice the money, you can buy a thomas compressor that has more power, is a lot less noisy, and a much better machine."
4,Hitachi's Dependable Compressor,"I chose the Hitachi three years ago because it has a fine compressor and motor, solid construction, and overall good design. It has been entirely reliable and three years later I still am using it both in my cabinet shop and on the job for residential remodeling. The only significant design flaw is the position of the gauges. They are subject to being knocked off. I found this out the hard way one day when I had to slam on the brakes in my van and a sliding tool box sheared one of them off. Despite this one flaw I would still by another Hitachi in a heart beat. The Hitachi is not only reliable, but, unlike many compressors, it truly works on 15 amps. This compressor has never blown a fuse on me, which is something of a miracle considering the wiring in many of the older homes I remodel."
5,A long time ago...,"...I actually saw these guys live. They came out on stage to Beck's ""Loser"", and put on a heck of a show. The bass player (also the singer) even grabbed a guy from the audience, and had him play the bass for one song.On the strength of that show, I bought this CD (its been 12 years ago now), and I still listen to it every now and again. Its not the best stuff you'll ever hear, but it sure is fun to listen to. If you like your grunge/punk with tongue planted firmly in cheek (I know--cliche'), this is a CD for you.Incidentally, ""The Chair"" was dedicated to O.J. Simpson at the concert. Now go listen to the lyrics. :-)"
2,Hard to understand instructions,I thought the game would be fun but it is all but impossible for younger kids to understand the instructions. I would not recommend for kids under 13
1,no rope,It would have been a great product but it did not come with a rope. It states that is does in the ad.
5,A little gem!,This product is a little gem. My children love it! I wanted them to learn to play Chinese Jumprope the way I did when I was a kid. They sure are enjoying learning the games. I was so impressed that it came with two ropes. One is short and one is long. It helps having both sizes for the games. Klutz always does a great job with their products. I am so pleased with this purchase.
4,"Easy to use, goes anywhere","I bought this for my 8-year-old daughter as something she could take to school in her pocket or school bag to play with on the play ground. When I was in elementary school we girls always played jump rope on the play ground during recess. But before the bell rang and after school we didn't have access to the playground toys. A Chinese jump rope was something we could wad up in our pockets and use any time we wanted. The ideas in this book were new to me...not at all like the kinds of ""jumps"" my friends and I did back in the day. But new ideas are always fun. My daughter loves her new jump rope and her friends at school are enjoying it too. It's so simple even my younger two children can play with her...or she can use a couple of kitchen chairs to hold the ends of the elastic so she can practice when no one's around to play."
4,Definitely worth a try!,"Overall, these are some of the best pods I've ever tried. I particularly liked the Lava Java and Chocolate Paradise, and the Estate Blend Medium Roast wasn't bad either. Even at 20% Kona, these have a distinctive and high-quality flavor, it makes me curious to try the 100% Kona. I do wish they were a little stronger though, most of the blends were watery at the 8 oz (double cup) setting with my Senseo and I feel like they're too expensive to just use at the 4 oz. Nevertheless, this is very smooth and delicious coffee without bitterness or bad aftertaste."
5,worth Ten stars,This is some of the best coffee ever made! I'm so happy they have it in pods now. I use it in my Senseo pod coffee maker.
1,Poor Design,Handle pops off when you try to turn fast plus gashed my hand open after it slipped off multiple times! Don't bother!
3,"Doesn't get rid of chunks, but you might not want it for that","My son is G-tube fed and only eats purees. This can be a challenge going to a restaurant. Carrying around an plug-in blender is a chore and restaurants rarely let us use it anyway. So, I bought this in hopes of being able to puree my son's food by hand so he could eat it.It works so so. For a chunky salsa this would be great. In fact, I'm keeping it because it does chop some veggies the way I like them for soups.But if you're looking for a nonelectric chopper, this is certainly sufficient.And if anyone has any suggesting on pureeing foods in restaurants, I'd love them."
1,Disgusted! Worse purchase ever online!!!,I am disgusted. I thought it was wierd when I took it out of the box that there wasn't any plactic around the box. Then when I opened it up I noticed that none of the parts were wrapped in plastic either. Then as I began to pull it out I noticed that there was dried up food on the blades. Absolutly horrible!
3,noise starting with track4,"I enjoyed the first 3 tracks but after the 4th track, backgroundnoise became worse and after 8th track, it is unbearable. SinceI opened the CD wrapper, I cannot return it. So let this be a lesson to future buyers."
4,"Magic Dirt Rock, lots.","Magic Dirt are one of the most rockin bands in Australia and have begun to be noticed. This album is the result of combining two of their earliest EPs and some extra songs. Now i believe that Magic Dirt keep getting better and better, so while there are some amazing tracks on this compile like their breakthrough underground hit ""Ice"" as well as ""Daddy"" (both from the ""Life Was Better..."", there are some odd ones like ""choker"" from Magic Dirt's first release. But it is overall a really great loud album. Hard to find though, only released outside Australia i think."
2,"Faded Blue, Gary Morris Cassette","I had thought I was getting a CD and instead I got a cassette. I was disappointed about that. I can still play it, but it doesn't have the quality of a CD. But if you love Gary Morris, it's him. So go for it."
1,Very Disappointed!,Did I receive the correct DVD?!?! This looked like someone made this on their home computer. Can someone please contact me for a refund? This DVD was about 30 minutes long!
3,Dreams of ancient Rome,"Guido d'Este is being blackmailed by his aunt because of some bad investments he made for her. A friend of the aunt, Countess Fortiguerra, plots to have her beautiful daughter Cecilia marry Guido for his money. Guido suspects the plot from the start, but can't help falling in love with her anyway. Meanwhile, Guido's friend Lamberto Lamberti meets Cecilia and has a strange sensation that he's met her long ago. Cecilia has always thought she was one of the Vestal Virgins of ancient Rome, and Lamberto dreams of encountering her in that setting. Guido proposes to her, and she accepts. The dreams of both Cecilia and Lamberto of ancient Rome continue to play an important role in the story, however, until Cecilia realizes she is meant to be with Lamberto. The dream device for bringing the two main characters together is rather hard to swallow, despite the romantic element of it which intrigued Crawford. The story as a whole also is not one of Crawford's best."
5,"Insightful, Playful, and Motivating",You can open this book to any page and find a motivating and soul refreshing exercise that is simple to do and fulfilling to accomplish. Thank you Dr. Siegel for this helpful and heart-touching book.
2,Check compatibility,"It did not have the tips for my Lenovo Thinkpad (or indeed ANY lenovo laptops). In general compatibility information is hard to find. I went to the www.eReplacements.com site and the page for the battery said it had 13 tips (it came with 9) and supported 95% of laptop models including Lenovo, though a link to the list of models did not include Lenovo and seemed to correspond with the list that came with the battery. However the battery page is no longer accessible from eReplacements (maybe after I complained by phone). So if considering this battery be aware that it's a gamble though Amazon will pay to take it back (in the end I found a colleague with a Sony Vaio that it fitted so did not return it)."
1,"Laptop extended battery ""Premium Power Model: M-UPS-L14""","Don't buy! Waste of money! Stay away from those no name ""Chinese brand"" Products.""Premium Power Model: M-UPS-L14""Get's you into trouble with TSA! Looks like a home rigged bomb in scanner image!The 130 Wh Capacity is a joke! My laptop has a 4Ah battery (44 Wh) and runs about 3 hours.With the M-UPS-L14 I get at most 2hrs! And it claims to be a 130Wh unit!Most likely some cheap NiCad cells, definitly not Li-Iion.Always maintained it charged it no longer works, my laptop battery which is older still works fine.The battery housing now bulges obviously some cells are defective and likely popped open.Garbage at a price."
4,midwest blues,Good Midwest sound from a Wisconsin blues band. Nice mix of covers and originals. Not a clunker on the cd.
5,Excellent!,"At the Breast is sociology at its best-- we think of breastfeeding as ""natural"" but of course it is social and cultural too. Blum's discussion of how race and class shape women's attitudes toward breast feeding--and their chances of success with it -- was a revelation to me. If you read this book, you'll think twice before casually assuming that women who don't breastfeed are selfish, bad moms, lazy, ignorant etc etc. I can't recommend this book highly enough!"
4,Not simply a how-to book on the pros of breastfeeding...,"This book has gotten bashed because it doesn't come out and say that breastfeeding is a must - but it does reveal a diversity of opinions, some of them mixed, about breast feeding. I found it refreshing and a welcome change from the ""Women MUST breastfeed"" books out there, masquerading as ""unbiased"" but actually quite one-sided. Yes, I believe breastfeeding is a good thing for mother and child but this doesn't mean (as Ms. Blum reveals) that it is always a joy. Unfortunately, I'm afraid so many will bash this book that it won't get a fair chance at finding its readership - and that is too bad."
1,Boo to proprietary rebranded lexmark cartridges,"These ink cartridges are just rebranded lexmark 16 (black) and 26 (color) cartridges. Why pay above full retail prices for a regular lexmark cartridge? Do what I did, take a hi-res photograph of the ""color bar codes"" on the ""Primera"" cartridges. Print them out on high quality paper at a high dpi and tape them to the underside of the printhead mechanism where the reader can find them. You'll never need to buy another rebranded cartridge again. I buy genuine, high yield Lexmark 26 color carts on average for $16 shipped. And I've gone through over 30,000 prints so far with my machine. That's easily a savings of over $500 since I bought my printer over 4 years ago."
4,Coastal Fun,"If you are a Hegwood fan, come on, read this book. It is a bit slower moving than his other novels, but the usual Hegwood cast of characters is here. This time at a Casino music spectacular. And the insurance companies get stung. And there is some pretty good misdirection. And the untangling of the plot will grab you. And ,yes, you can figure it out - almost- but I will not spoil the fun. Guess what I like about Hegwood is that there are clues to the solution ,and so far he seems to play fair in letting his readers speculate about the conclusion."
3,buy a can of Pam,Despite the no stick claim the head and tail areas need a shot of grease. Grandson loves eating the pancakes! If you attempt an egg-shaped dinosaur don't use the recipe on the pkg. Make them thick not runny or else the mixture seeps out of the bottom of the rings.
1,Fell apart after a month,I knew it was cheaply made when I bought it. So I guess this was no suprise.
4,Deserves A Bigger Audience,"Add Carlene Carter to the list of those who based on talent deserve to be much more successful than they have been. Little Acts of Treason rocks roots hard on some cuts, is blues tinged on some others, while its core are her smart, yearning ballads of love gone right and wrong. Little Acts of Treason, Change, and You'll Be the One are highlights. Best of the uptempo numbers are Love Like This, He Will Be Mine, and The Lucky Ones. Once married to Nick Lowe and the daughter of country royalty Carl Smith and June Carter Cash, Carter has her feet firmly in both the classic country and guitar pop worlds. The sound that personal history produces is hers alone. The best cut on the CD, her duet with her father, on Loose Talk is a perfect snapshot of what she's all about. Thirteen cuts, at least eight of them top notch -- Come Here You, reprised as the last thing on the CD, is probably the least interesting --, make this CD a buy if you stumble onto this work."
1,not reliable nor repairable,"I bought mine in 2007, installed it in Summer 2008, it has been used less than 50 hours total and this Summer (2011, it's out of warranty) it went belly up, took it to the local Xantrex ""REPAIR"" center and guess what, it can't be repaired; OH THE IRONY! The AC board (they think) went bad and can't be replaced. What an expensive piece of garbage, no more Xantrex for me. I was told by the repair center that Xantrex is making them irreparable as their objective. I don't see how something that costs close to a grand is built with intent that it cannot be repaired. Thanks Xantrex!!!!!"
4,"Xantrex, a real value","The Xantrex inverter was delivered quicker than expected and although I have not installed it yet as it is still winter here, it will be the120 volt source of backup power sourced by my new solar PV/battery system. I am confident that I chose a top product from the plethora ofchoices out there."
5,This product smells,"It's my wife's longtime favorite fragrance, but for some reason hard to find here on Long Island, even in the big department stores.Amazon helped me find exactly what she wanted...and to stop her from driving around the area on fruitless searches. (Se's not computer-literate and has no desire to be so.But she smells nice.)"
3,Shalimar by Guerlain.,This item was just okay.I think next time I will consider purchasing the perfume instead of the eau deToilette.
4,bought for a gift,I purchased this perfume for my mother as a gift. She absolutley loves it. We bought some shalimar from a store and the smell wasn't that great. She told me that this bottle of shalimar smells wonderful and the right one she was looking for
4,Fabulous,"This is a great perfume. Shipment was quick. I would have appreciated more contact from the seller, but the product arrived well packaged and intact."
1,What Your Doctor May Not tell You about colorectal cancer,This book is more useful for someone interested in prevention than it is for someone that already has colorectal cancer. I bought this book looking for new treatments and hope and didn't find anything that my doctor hadn't already told me.
3,Watch the dates on books!,"The cancer field is growing so fast that books are having a hard time keeping up. This book gave me some standard information, but it is not up to date with procedures."
4,Good for a start,"Offers a individualized chart that isuseful. Software dated and can notsave unless printed out, but,good for the novice."
2,"Okay, but not great","The ""Mapping Your...(Travels, Love Life, Future, Financial Potential, gods alone know what else)"" series of astrology books is meant for a niche market: the person who isn't an astrologer, but would like some not-too-complicated information on their travels, love life, or in this case, future. The advice is solid but simplistic; however, no information is given on how long the transits last. In addition, I do not believe the discs supplied with these books will work on a Windows Eight or later computer."
5,Weekly Usage,"I purchased this book several years ago in a used book store. It came with a software program. I generate a two-week horoscope for myself once a fortnight and have done so for several years. The largest benefit I derive from doing so is to understand my moods. For instance, if I feel frustrated, I won't be so quick to blame my environment for my mood if I know that my natal Mars forms an aspect with transiting Saturn. While I don't believe I ever read the book through, I have found the CD that comes with the book very beneficial."
4,good band,never heard of this band down under but like their music and have ordered a couple more of their cd's
5,Amazing work of art...,"I've always been a huge fan of the Pumpkins, and I love this CD. Mos of the reviews are right in saying that this is only for hardcore fans. I actually enjoy listening to the drawn out I Am One and Silverf*ck. It took a while to get used to Billy's long rants in the middle of his songs, but finally it grew on me. Why Am I So Tired? is an excellent track. It's almost very peaceful, yet it rocks at the same time. All of the other songs are very good, Billy really knows how to stir up excitement in the live shows. The non-live stuff like Bugg Superstar (which is the catchiest piece of music ever written... ever.) are also really good."
4,Tom Maxwell's Still Zippin',"The Countdown Quartet's debut album is as infectious as their live performances. Much of the music has a jazz bent similar to some of the work he created with the Squirrel Nut Zippers. As of this writing, the group has been touring the South with Southern Culture on the Skids. In addition to fresh new tunes like ""Countdown's Comin"" they also cover ""Tiger Rag."" If you're a fan of the Zippers, you'll appreciate the songs from The Countdown Quartet."
3,"Okay, only..","Not a bad book, but certainly not the in-depth bio I was hoping for. The author spends a lot of time on particular situations (his arrest in France) but skips entire years and decades, mentions very little about his wives (which I would think critical to understanding the man). The thesis of the book (and a true one) seems to be that in a post-industrial world of conformist clones, e.e. was a true individual and a true artist. I just wish this book had more depth, itself (it's actually a relatively short book for e.e.'s very full life)."
1,Cracked product,I ordered this as a Christmas gift last year and was informed that there was a crack in the dish! The person didn't seem to want to send it back but I was disappointed to get this information. Please secure these products so that they do not arrive broken.
1,packing not all it's 'cracked' up to be!,"I'm sure this is a great casserole - but I ordered it twice and both times the top was cracked to the point of pieces missing. The inside packing was so flimsy that I don't think it could make it to my neighor's house and back without getting damaged. Amazon's return policy is great, but I'd wait a while until they get the packing issue settled."
3,Nice addition to the other Among Friends collection,"This is a nice addition to any cookbook collection. Easy to make, delicious receipes. This cookbook offers a non-traditional twist to staple receipes we all love such as: Chicken Jambalaya, Brisket, Sweet and Sour Beef, and Sweet Pork Chops. I would suggest acquiring Just a Matter of Thyme (by the same author) before purchasing this cookbook. Just a Matter of Thyme has more traditional receipes that are wonderful!"
3,nice soup and salad section,"I have all of the cookbooks in this series and love them all. However, I find this cookbook to have non-traditional main dishes such as Jambalaya, Turkey Forestier, and Spinach Pie. The soup and salad section is wonderful, however. My recommendation is to first accquire Just a Matter of Thyme (by the same authors) and then supplement the collection with this cookbook."
5,Excellent biography,"Robert Lowell is condidered one of the greatest American poets of the 20th century; some rank him second only to Frost. His poetry, always extremely personal and frank, and displaying great technical skill (he wrote in strict classical forms; only late in life did he write in free verse), was highly praised and prized: he won three Pulitzers. A Catholic convert, later an agnostic, he wrestled mightily with the Creator in his work. He suffered 8 nervous breakdowns during his life and was married three times. During the 1960s, he was a visible participant in the anti-war movement. Mariani is an excellent writer himself and tells Lowell's life story, from the successes to the heartbreaks, interestingly and well."
4,Hand beater,"Have not used it much, but glad i have it if the power goes out.Seemed to me to be a bit expensive, but cost more on other sites."
1,Where is my item???? Never received!!,I tracked my package and it says it was delivered...in Williston and it was supposed to go to Alburgh?? I don't see any way to contact the seller....and I am frustrated. What happened? Please contact me - I have never experienced this through Amazon before... Thank you.
4,Retro Kitchen Gadget,I remember my mother using one of these hand beaters to make meringue. That was more than 30 years ago. I was really surprised to find a new one all these years later. I'm delighted with my Norpro hand beater. It works!!
1,Doesn't work,"The egg beater came quickly and properly packaged, but it doesn't work well. Went back to square one and asked my brother if I could have our mother's (dating back maybe forty years)."
5,Best Mixer Ever,"I was searching for a ""manual hand mixer"" all over the internet and finally found it! I've had this for years, handed down from my great grandmother and I love it for mixing all my recipes. It works quickly just like an electric, for making cakes, crepes, whips, blends, mixes and creams. Even great for gravies. No fuss, no electricity, no batteries, just an old fashioned great utensil! Ten times better then just a whisk. Cleans easily. Irreplaceable, lasts a lifetime! Amazon never fails me in finding exactly what I'm looking for!"
2,Didn't last a year,The last egg beater I owned lasted 20 years and I paid 3 dollars for it. This one lasted less than a year before the beater broke.
5,Just what I needed,"It was just a little item, but I needed a hand held eggbeater and this was just the thing. Arrived right in time, and is just like one I had once before. Good service all around."
1,Poorly made,"Probably the third time I used this, the shafts started to slip in the nylon gears. Will not function at all now. Expensive, shiney junk!"
1,not so great,I used this maybe 5 times and it fell apart. First the beaters slipped from the gears. next the beaters became totally disconnected. Not a good product.
3,good red bean paste,Everything is perfect except that one of the two packs that I've bought was out of date....and it smells full of alcohol....
3,Bought this a few years ago worked ok.,Worked great. Stuff sometimes gets stuck underneath at the blade - hard and dangerous to clean. After a while some rust so we tossed it.
5,A brilliant book about Zen in history,This book gives an excellent perspective on the role of Zen in modern Japanese political philosophy. It has always played a critical role in Japanese military theory and the martial arts. In modern times it became an integral part of the political theories that set Japan on a course for military expansion in Asia. The book is well-researched and documents how top Zen leaders actively supported Japan's dreams of empire.
5,Definitely Underrated!,"It still amazes me that this album did not do as well as it should have. Tony Thompson had major production on this album and was the perfect blend for his voice. The ballads on Sexsational are nice, has a still-relevant sound to them. Goodbye Eyes was an absolute fave, I also like Babyface-produced ""Dance with Me."" It's definitely album for the mature ears with ""Handle Our Business"", and ""Slave."" For all of the 70's-80's baby who wants to get a good dose of that ol skool 90's, true R&B;, New Jack Swing-sound, you definitely want this album! Love it![...]Sexsational"
2,Could have been a lot better,"This is just an average CD. I was expecting big things from this project, but Mr. Thompson just didn't deliver. However, ""Sweat"" and the Stevie Wonder remake, ""My Cherie Amour"" are the bright spots. The voice is there. The songs are not."
1,Just Absolutely Horrible,"When I purchased this compact disc, I was expecting top-notch Babyface-Dave Hollister-Teddy Riley production. I got New Kids on the Block. This album was touched by the R&B man himself, Kenneth B. Edmonds, and the mainstream phenomenon group Blackstreet, but yet it still has nothing to offer. Despite decent vocals, and great direction, Tony still disappoints. To say it was herendous would be an understatement.Overall: Do NOT buy this album, you'll be wasting your lunch money."
4,Beautiful CD,"This is a wonderful CD by Tony Thompson. He had such a distinct voice and I'm glad he did a solo album. I have always been a fan of Hi Five and am glad that they have left an lasting impression on the music world. I wish they could have made a come back album, but the group wouldn't be the same without Tony anyways. He can never be replaced. R.I.P. Tony.You still have a fan over here.Peace"
3,A Great Career Cut Short,"Tony Thompson's claim to fame was as the lead singer of the 1990's R&B group Hi Five. ""Sexsational"" was his first, and sadly, only solo effort. While a fairly decent effort, I was looking forward to hearing more solid material from this talented young man. Unfortunatley, Tony's life was recently cut short. May he finally rest in peace."
1,"A Sad Case, to be sure","I love Alberic Magnard's symhonies, and have all 4 recordings of all 4 symphonies available--always excited to hear new nuances brought out in this composer's works.Sad to say, but Sanderling's performance and the recording here are hopelessly muddled. From start to finish, the romantic qualities and French texture are bogged down in mind boggling uninspired performances all the way around. You get the sense that Sanderling was FORCED to make this recording, and that his heart and mind weren't into it. The recording has so much reverb you can hardly make out individual parts.Avoid at all costs, and instead, go for the Michael Plasson on EMI."
5,Nothing better than Xantrex!,Xantrex inverters have always performed great for my business. The on/off switch does wear out after a few years of use but is easily replaced.
5,An expert view on Yugoslav Wars,"Nora Beloff was one of the greatest experts on Balkan affairs in UK (and Europe). She was editor of ""THE GUARDIAN"" papers and she was actively writting until her tragic death. Unlike many of her colleagues in Britain (and West in general), she actually knows very well what is she writting about! Her expertise on Balkans is unsurpassed and she has written several books on this matter. She states the facts, destroys propaganda and explains clearly who is who in Balkans and what was West's part in break up of Yugoslavia. If you are interested in Balkans, or you want to know how todays governments and media operate, function and create propaganda- this book is for you"
1,Waste of time and money,"Just another worthless propaganda book. It's overwhelmingly pro-serbian, portrays the serbs as almost the only victims of war in the former yugoslavia. Blames everybody except the serbs for starting the war. Ignores the fact that for centuries the serbs tried to enslave the region through force and establish a greater serbia, which is still their goal."
1,Warning! Misrepresentation!,"As sold this item provides 150 watts maximum. It has to be modified at considerable effort to provide the 300-500 watts claimed. This modification voids the warrenty and has a high likelihood of ruining the unit for good. In addition, unless you design your own interchangable rewiring, once modified, it will be usable only when directly connected to a vehicle battery and NOT via the cigarette lighter. If you need versatility, look for a unit that comes with interchangable or dual power cords (one for direct battery connection, one for cigarette lighter connection). If you need the higher wattage, get one already wired for direct battery connection. If you don't need the higher wattage, you can buy a smaller, less expensive unit."
4,WELL DONE COLLECTION OF WHITE ZOMBIE/ROB ZOMBIE SONGS,"THIS GREATEST HITS COLLECTION OF WHITE ZOMBIE/ROB ZOMBIE IS VERY WELL DONE. MOST OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD BUT THIS COLLECTION COULD'VE USED A COUPLE MORE SONGS FROM ''ASTRO CREEP 2000''. ''THUNDERKISS '65'', ''MORE HUMAN THAN HUMAN'', ''DRAGULA'', ''SUPERBEAST'', ''NEVER GONNA STOP'', ''FEEL SO NUMB'', ''FEED THE GODS'', ROB'S VERSION OF THE RAMONES CLASSIC ''BLITZKRIEG BOP'', AND ''LIVING DEAD GIRL'' ARE ALL GOOD SONGS BUT THEY SHOULD'VE ALSO INCLUDED ''EL PHANTASMO & THE CHICKEN RUN BLAST O RAMA'' ''ELECTRIC HEAD'' PT. 1 AND 2, AND THE DRAGULA REMIX ON THIS CD. THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS COLLECTION IS ITS DVD WHICH INCLUDE 10 WHITE ZOMBIE/ROB ZOMBIE VIDEOS. THE DVD IS A VERY CLEVER IDEA BUT, IT SHOULD HAVE THE VIDEOS FOR ''ELECTRIC HEAD'' PT. 2 AND THE DRAGULA REMIX. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS COLLECTION IS FILLED WITH ENOUGH GOOD SONGS TO MAKE THIS AN ENJOYABLE CD."
4,Good value for Rob Zombie fans,"This Cd is a great collection of RZ stuff, including a bunch of great music videos on the DVD which is included in the digipack. All the hits featuring Riggs, Blasko and Tempesta are here as well as some previously unreleased stuff, however although it's a great release, it doesn't satisfy the craving for new material as Rigg's solo project (Scum of the Earth) and Blasko's new band (Rock City Morgue) does. Still it's worth getting and will round out your RZ collection for sure."
4,Awesome CD,"This compilation CD by Rob Zombie is one of the best. It has a couple smash hits as well as two new songs, a 30 page booklet and a DVD with 10 music videos - some of the MVs are previously unreleased!However, it would've been a lot better if the booklet that came with the CD had more pictures from his White Zombie days...Nonetheless, the CD is superb!Highly Recommend: ""Living Dead Girl"" and ""The Great American Nigthmare"""
5,a great CD choice! ^^,"I thought this CD was great. It's got unreleased music videos, a couple classics as well as two new songs.The downside is that it should've included photos with White Zombie (coz that's what made him famous, right?), even though the idea of the 30+ page booklet was great.If you have never listened to Rob Zombie before, I would seriously recommend the CD because there are lots of freebies (like the DVD and the booklet) and classics as well as new songs.Or if you are a Rob Zombie fan, the unreleased music videos and the booklet would increase your incentive to get it, right? ^^"
4,Good Shock Rock and Metal,"When I first bought this CD/DVD combo I bought it for certain songs off of it. But after listening to the whole CD I found more songs I enjoy from the artist know as Rob Zombie. I did take away one star because I actually didn't like track 3 called Feed the gods, also track 7 called Hands of Death, and last track 8 The Great American Nightmare. The rest I enjoy lots inculding his covers of I'm your boogieman and then the cover of Brickhouse featuring Lionel Richie and Trina. So overall if your into some shock rock and metal songs then pick this CD up and enjoy the music Mr. Rob Zombie put out for his fans and people who are open minded enough to try his music out."
5,If you could only buy one Zombie disc then this is it,I have all of Zombie's discs and this is a very good collection of all the very best he did (but all his discs are worth having). They could have called it 'best of Zombie' and it would contain the same tracks. The bonus dvd is nice if you haven't experienced his visual artistry along with the music.
5,This is what a greatest hits should look & sound like !!!,"As a Kiss fan I've been overwhelmed with ""Greatest hits"" albums and rehashed stuff that I no longer buy them. This however is what a Greatest hits album should be like: the best tracks (obviously) of Rob's carreer BUT... also a few new songs, awesome packaging (THICK booklet, cool digi-pack) and to top it off an awesome DVD with some never before seen videos that are worth the album's price alone !!! WOW !!! I agree DVD can hold more media as someone else mentioned but hey: it's a FREE extra, remember ? I think it just feeds our appetite for a FULL Rob Zombie DVD with a full recent show and more videos but until then.... he sure knows how to please his fans !!!"
5,one of the all time best.,"i paid 10 bucks for this at a record store (new) and it has a definate place in my cd case above my viser. 19 outstanding songs plus a dvd with his videos...what a bargain. i especially like demon speeding (#14) i had not heard that one before, but they are all good."
4,Excellent Greatest Hits,This album is a rather good collection of tunes from his years in White Zombie and his solo effort.PROS:1. All the major hits are here.2. Alot of lesser known and previously unreleased tunes3. Comes with a bonus DVD that includes White Zombie era and solo music videos.4. One of the songs features GOD himself: Alice CooperCONS:1. Alot of the songs sound like another one on the disc2. Some just plain suck.
2,"For Zombie's greatest hits, get 1st two White Zombie albums!","Rob Zombie's greatest hits were with White Zombie. His solo career is some kinda computer programed mindless vomit. For Rob's greatest hits see La Sexorcisto and Astro Creep 2000.Rob is lost without White Zombie. Why don't he loose his gigantic ego and call up the old band. I'd actually listen then.By the way, haven't the last three Rob Zombie album covers been basically the same? How about a little more effort!Anyway Rob Zombie is a living joke and a has-been. He makes a living off of his image and will probably be the next heavy metal clown like Ozzy. Lets kick this sellout to the curb!"
4,Worthy Purchase,"This cd would have gotten 5 stars if they included scum of the earth, and more of his solo work instead of so much white zombie stuff. IF you want a cd that will keep you rockin and don't care if the lyrics make as much sense as running shoes for a cripple, then buy this cd."
4,Zombie All the Way,"I've never been a big follower of Rob Zombie, but some of these songs are just irresistable. I put it in heavy rotation on my car's MP3 player for quite a while! Some great tunes to power your workouts, too."
1,"The worse form of ""music"" ever...","I cant belive people actullie enjoy, the untalent and boring to death sound of mortician...Are they high when they listing to mortician to think its actullie good ? First of all, if your graving for mortician? Then, all you realy need is just one mortician cd, because the rest is basically all the same ""music"" and it realy does sound exectly the same... mortician's ""chainsaw dismembrement"" is a disgrace to deathmetal period, and i hope mortician retires realy soon, or they'll go bankrup, unless these posers still are willing to support such trash. Mortician is trash..."
1,*Sigh...*,"I'm surprised at myself. I'm surprised that I chose to grace this p.o.s with a review. Just look at the cover. Read the track titles. Listen to the ""songs."" Then go jump off a bridge. Seriously. Anyone who listens to this really needs a life. I thought At The Gates and In Flames came along in 1995 to wipe this junk off the death metal slate. Why do people waste their time with this. And Cannibal Corpse. And Deicide. All their 'musik' is about stupid, gory, almost pornographic topics. Their vocalists sound like retarded gorillas and the song structures are repetitive. Don't tell me I can't handle it. Don't tell me I can't understand the technicality. I could give a rat's [butt] about that, seeing as how I can't even stand 2 seconds of it. You want music that's heavy and different, then listen to Puya."
3,GrrrrGrrrrGruntGrowl... and its SO low too!!!,"I like Mortician & respect them as a death metal band because they do their own thing & dont sell out like some bands do... I guess it would be nice if they could use real drums for some of their songs... but I guess that's what makes them who they are. I totally prefer listening to some good ol' Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, early Deicide, any Death album, Suffocation, early Entombed, Decapitated, whatever... but this was an interesting listen... check out that re-release of Hacked Up 4 BBQ/Zombie Apoc. package. It's not bad either."
4,PRETTY COOL ALBUM.,This cd has the classic mortician sound which is basically being very heavy and fast.This cd has alot more bass than previous efforts which to me is a good thing.If you are a fan of the band then you will probably like this and if you are not then this cd will not change your opinion.
1,Ohh Pul-ease!,"This is a senseless joke. They think they are so scary with their bizarre ""music""(if you can call it that) and shocking lyrics. And the cover art to ""Chainsaw Dismemberment"" is so lame. How can there be explicit lyrics when you can't understand what the dude's saying. Mortician are a joke. This CD is a joke. No talent. No musical skill. Just trying to be trendy. Next."
1,Who would even buy this!,"The vocalist sounds like he's drowning, the guitarists play the same power chord over and over again disregarding any rythm, and the songs are utterly pointless. That basically summs up Mortician."
1,My Two Cents,I have written numderous reviews for this album and not one has been posted. i am going to write another review right now in hope of it gettin' posted. ok...here it goes. this is very dumb music and it is NOT brutal. Spinecast and cryptopsy are brutal. this is a repetitive joke band.
1,Mortician's albums all belongs in the trash...,"One question still remains, that mortician's fans haven't answer me yet...Why support mortician, when there's billions of other bands who are much better, and can make what we like to call music? Not pointless noise, about nothing, over , and, over, again.Mortician's ""chainsaw dismenberment"" sounds like everything these guys have already done, and i dont know how any one in their right mind,siriously, enjoy such mediocre crap. Where's the technical sound ? Where's the solo's ?Why grunt so damn low ? i remenber seeing exhumed on tour with mortician and when mortician played ? I just heard the instruments because Will rahmer (bass/vocals) grunted so damn low that, it was impossible to hear him but exhumed did outplayed those posers in mortician!"
1,ahahaha,"Um, I saw somebody praise Mortician for their ""low vocals"". hahahahahahha. You actually think the guy can growl that low? Of course he can't. Those are almost below possible levels of speech or growling. What Mortician (and many other death metal bands do) is scream, record it, and use computer software or technology in the studio to pitch shift the sound way lower than it actually is, also using harmonizers. This is an age old trick. I can do it on my own computer as well. It's all effects, not real."
1,The worst death metal band in existence...,"This is not a death metal release, this is a joke and a disgrace. The untalented members of Mortician know about three chords, hook up a drum machine, and create about an hour of the worst death/grind metal I've ever heard in my life. Featuring vocals so altered by electronics they are lower than the bass guitar, no musicality at all, nothing but disconnected two chord riffs over a drum machine, and a weak overall sound, this really bites it. The lyrics are silly horror knockoffs, and really epitomize why death metal has gotten such scrutiny. Don't buy this unless you have a sleeping disorder, guys. Stick to real DM acts like Cryptopsy, Carcass, Malignancy, Morbid Angel, Immolation, Nile, or Pessimist. These guys are just imposters. and if you want grindcore, check out Carcass's first album. But stay away from this, it's terrible."
2,Nerd rock for the grind core set,"So this band is the most br00tal, the most anti-music band ever! Congratulations nerds, you win! And we lose. Like A.C. without the brains, musicality or humor, boring."
2,blllaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh,"Mortician are getting extremly tired in the ""grind"" genre.. this morticians what? 20th? 30th album?? I've listened half of it, and if you really need to get a Mortician fix i suggest HOUSE BY THE CEMETARY. It's not as hiliarious as their other releases but its up there with em. Anyway.. its the usual on Chainsaw Dismemberment..overly detuned guitars, clicky;slappy drum programs and Will Rahmers ever so popular 8 liners accompanied by his dumptruck-falling-off-the-empire-state building-in-the-middle-of-the-night bass tone. oh joy."
1,What the hell is this?!,"Mortician may very well be the worst death metal band ever. The vocals are some of the worst attempts at growling that i've ever heard. The guitar consists of repeated chords with distortion and no solos. Bass?! Hah, that's a good one. There is no drummer because they use a drum machine, which shows that they are lazy. The horror film clips in their songs end up being longer than the songs themselves. This band has to be a joke. For good death metal, listen to the bands marxist matt listed."
1,Yeah ... right!,"Buy this and suffer is more like it. This is the worst ""music"" I have ever heard. I could belch songs more coherently than this! Get your ears out of the gutter and listen to better metal."
3,"aye, not bad",i heard a song from this on saturday night and it was the heaviest stuff i've ever heard. i've heard the rest of it now and it is pretty good too but not that good and that's why i gave it 3 stars and not more.
5,coooool,"Mortician are awesome, the heaviest band out there, brutal death, drum machine adds an edge and the singing is the lowest ever, buy it. the people that give this 1 star dont know deathmetal much"
1,Mortician is a really bad band,"I love extreme metal, but Mortician just doesn't cut it. First of all, why use a drum machine? There are plenty of drummers out there that can match the speed of Mortician's computer (ex.: Nick Barker). Guitar-wise, it's heavy and unbelievably repetitive. Vocally, they illustrate why most people think growling and grunting is dumb. It can be a great thing if done properly, but the guy in Mortician just doesn't cut it. The final verdict: Buy some real death/black metal instead."
2,"A not very useful, but pretty book...","I really wanted to like this book, because the photographs are good, the writing is good, and there is at least SOME useful information. And, it's a good pre-trip motivator. The problem is, it's the kind of book that should NEVER have been structured as a guide - instead, with a bit of rewriting, it could have (and should have) been a high quality coffee table book. To be fair, I found the overviews of each trail segment and the trail profiles to be quite useful. But, after hiking 430 miles of the CDT in Montana/Idaho, I have concluded that: 1) this guide is nowhere near detailed enough, 2) it is, unfortunately, not adequately set up for north to south hiking. My approach now is to sift through this book and extract whatever useful information I can find and add those tidbits to Jim Wolf's excellent, detailed, and comprehensive guidebooks, which are continually updated with new trail information."
1,Seven Dollars in the Trash Can,"Based on the reviews, I was anxious to try this product. The pieces did not stay together when the poultry was placed over it. We tried numerous times thinking that we were doing something wrong but we evidently received a faulty product. While the prongs fitted correctly in the holes provided, no matter how we placed them together at the top, they fell apart even before the bird was placed over the unit. Very disapointed!! We will continue to use the old roasting pan."
3,It serves its purpose.,"The pan is very small, requiring the use of a larger pan to catch all of the drippings. Also, it's a little hard to remove the chicken when it's done."
3,Mike Spokane,"This proguct is best when used in the oven. Refrain yourself using it in the BBQ grill Directly over Charcoal. otherwise the Norpro Poultry Roaster does a wonderful job. I used it several times to roast chicken, and they came out delicious and juicy. Nice product will recommend it to a friend."
3,Delightful!,"Phoebe and Chub by Matthew Henry Hall is a delightful book about best friends and special wishes.According to Phoebe (a tree frog), there are three rules that will assure happiness.1. Make lots of friends.2. Make your wishes known.3. Enjoy every moment.Phoebe lives by a creek at the bottom of a canyon. She has lots of friends. Chub, a fish, is one of her special friends. Together Phoebe and Chub meet new animal friends on their daily excursions. One day Phoebe shares her desire to fly with her friends. Those friends take Phoebe's wish and turn it into reality.Phoebe and Chub reminds us that we all can really do what our heart desires.The illustrations are colorful, realistic and will grab the attention of the child lucky enough to read this book."
4,Good George vs. Evil George...,"George Zucco shines in a dual role as both Dr. Lloyd Clayton and his evil twin brother Elwyn. Dr. Clayton killed Elwyn in self-defense and must face an undead version of his wicked sibling, who is now a vampire seeking to kill his own daughter Gayle (Mary Carlisle). Dwight Frye (Dracula, Frankenstein) is his old weird self as Zolarr, Elwyn's servant. Can Dr. Clayton kill his brother a second time before he fulfills his nefarious scheme? Watch and see! Recommended for those who love movies about vampires, sorcerers, black magic, occult, etc..."
1,Not enough substance,"I really like Andrew Cohen and his writings but this recording of a 'talk' he gave just doesn't say enough to make you want to listen to it twice. It takes him a long time to 'get to the point' and he comes across as a bit unsure about what he is going to say next .. (too many ""eh's"" and ""ah's"") It felt like I had just wasted time and money on one chapter of a book that hadn't really said very much. I'm sure he could put together a far superior package."
5,Delightful!,"This gem is easy on the wallet, unintimidating and useful. After you've struggled through some Hebrew Bible passages and consulted this and other reference grammars, read this one cover-to-cover and then you'll have an easier time reading the others."
5,a good quick reference,"This is just an outline and provides succinct explinations of various aspekts of Hebrew syntax. It's a great quick reference and a nice supplement to Waltke O'Connor, which you can browse if you want to do more in-depth study. Plus W/O is HUGE and HEAVY and NOT FUN to carry around all the time. Williams is only 122 pages, so it's much more portable!! It's a great resource! It's not meant to be a W/O, so it shouldn't be compared to it that way. It's almost a ""must have."""
4,Where Are These Okies???,"Wakeland is a four man outfit from Oklahoma. Having followed them in college starting in the late 80s, I always expected them to hit it big at some point. For a long time Wakeland and the Nixons were the two big names in the area. The Nixons managed to catch several trends at the right times while Wakeland was (in my opinion) always plagued by poor production in the studio. These songs are good on the CD (pretty much all of them), but lose 90% of the energy when compared to the live versions. I notice there are a few recent releases from Wakeland. I hope they've solved some of their problems. They are a great band."
5,"Dover Edition is not Unabridged, as marked on cover","I have two copies of this wonderful book in front of me...the Dover Juvenile Classics edition and the beautiful hardcover by Macmillan. Not only does the Dover edition omit all the sweet pictures, but right from the very first page it omits a sweet exchange between ""Mr. Author"" and an unnamed interlocutor--reminiscent of the story interruptions by the ""real"" Christopher Robin and the narrator of the Pooh stories. If something has obviously been cut out right from the first page, I'd bet other passages have been cut out, too. Perhaps this is unabridged from some version of the story, but it is definitely not the most complete text available. Stick to the hardcover or deluxe versions of the text for the real thing."
4,The Princess and the Goblin,"This classic 19th Century fairy tale still holds up 100 years later. George MacDonald was in a sense a feminist ahead of his time; the beautiful and mysterious grandmother is a central and memorable character. The goblins are wicked but not too scary. The descriptions of the [Welsh?] landscape are vivid, and the relationship between the princess and the humble miner's son, Curdie, speaks of breaking down class barriers."
5,Childrens Fairy Tale,This is an old tale about a princess who lives near a group of goblins. The goblins are the bad guys. A boy also comes into play as he's the one that finds out about the goblins evil plans.The whole book is written in an old fashion way. It makes it feel like such an old story even if a little hard to understand in a few places. Just a few.Very clean story children of any age would be fine reading it.
4,"Great edition, except NOT unabridged.","I was very pleased with this book in most respects. It has high quality binding, the illustrations are nice (both original by A. Hughs and H. Stratton). However, when I purchased the book it was unclear whether the version was unabridged or not. Reading some other reviews, I knew that some editions leave out at least some passages. In the first chapter, there is an exchange between the author and reader/listener ""THERE was once a little princess who-""But, Mr. Author, why do you always write about princesses?..."". This exchange is shown on the book description (which is misleading)...BUT, it is not actually in this version of the book. I didn't know what else might be left out as well. I ended up returning this book and purchasing a used copy of an older version, (which I am pleased with). It's a shame because in all other respects (illustrations, binding, etc.) this is a very nice edition."
5,I've gone back to this book many times over the years.,I had to go into the stacks in one place I lived to find this wonderful tale but every time I read it I relive the wonder and thrill of the first time I found this warm and wonderful story. It is full of magic which never fades. I keep young reading good books like this to my grandchildren and soon a great-grandchild. I am over 70 now but this is a story that never loses its wonder for me and for those I read it to. Read it and love it; no matter your age!
5,Reading level is wrong,"this was one of my favorite childhood books, one I read again and again. I would (and have) read it to my children. However, the language is Victorian, and in my opinion it is much too difficult for American readers of the ages indicated. If this edition is not simplified (horrors!) the difficulty of the language might lead to a child's abandoning it."
4,Classic 19th century children's novel,"George MacDonald's The Princess and the Goblin is a classic childrens tale of the 19th century, and one of the earliest and most influential. The story concerns a young princess (around 8 years when the story begins), and the devious plots of the goblins to kidnap her. To help her she has her new friend, the boy miner Curdie, and her beautiful and wise old grandmother.Any lover of children literature should definitely give this a read."
3,The movie...?,"The book is good, I liked the ending, but I definately know that the movie is WAY worse than the book. I shun those who made the movie, and hope that the writer realized that the people who he let make this film did a terrible job. I hope those who made the movie are reincarnated so that they are actually GOOD at what they do, so that everyone doesn't have to suffer through another one of these horrible movies."
4,It's A Boombox! Not High-End Electronics!,"Please excuse the reviewer who totally trashed the Sony CFDGT50. Believe it or not pal, there are many boomboxes that aren't even in the same league as this one.I found the FM to sound very pleasing. And the CD section was even better. Never used the cassette, so I can not comment. Remote control was a nice extra. All in all I am very satisfied with this model. The subwoofer added to the listening experiance. This is the perfect boombox for where you want to have music, like in the kitchen, garage or kids room. It's not high fidelity, but it was never meant to be. It's just a good boombox. Period."
4,good fix,This cable was a good replacement for the OEM cable. No modification or changes are needed! It's a direct replacement! I'm very happy with the product.
2,"It's a good book, if you like mostly talking!","This is a pretty good book, but I kind of expected more fighting. I can stand a little talking, but NOT THAT MUCH!!!"
5,"BattleTech Saga: Lethal Heritage, Blood of Kerensky Book One","Lethal Heritage, being the fourth BattleTech book I have read, is a solid introduction to the Blood of Kerensky trilogy. I recommend reading the Warrior trilogy before delving into the Blood of Kerensky, for a few choice reasons. First of all, the Warrior trilogy gives you a chance to familiarize yourself with Stackpole's writing style. In addition, the Warrior trilogy provides you with the necessary background knowledge of the Inner Sphere that you need to fully understand Lethal Heritage.Lethal Heritage is the commencement of the Clan invasion of the Inner Sphere. This action packed addition to the story of BattleTech is necessary in the continuance of the saga. The Blood of Kerensky trilogy as a whole is very important, and Stackpole thrives in the heat of battle."
5,taiji sword,it was a good instructional video aimed at the serious combat oriented martial artist. most taiji materials are aimed at fitness or spiritual growth so this was exactly what the doctor ordered. very good teaching style and thorough demonstration.the clear teaching style and ample demonstration make for an excellent learning source that is never too weighty.it could have been longer without being overwhelming.
3,Didn't Stick,"I use movie soundtracks as background while I work and enjoyed Atlantis so I bought the soundtrack. After listening to it a few times I have to say it is one of the few pieces of music I am just completely ambilivent to. It doesn't get bad anywhere, but it never catches my attention either. The pop song is a throw away, and the score just doesn't grab me. Nothing really steps out good or bad, it just doesn't stick in my mind at all."
4,Pretty good!!!,"Just your average soundtrack with background music. It DEFINITELY doesn't compare to any of John Williams' compositions, but it's very well done for an animated movie soundtrack!!!"
4,Different,"This is not your typical Disney soundtrack. It has only one song that is played during the ending credits. Everything else is pieces from the score, or orchestra soudtrack. The score has all the major elements of the movie: Action, adventure, heart, mystery, and wonder. If you've seen the movie, you may envision some of your favorite scenes while listening. If you haven't, you'll be taken to another world that is both familiar and new.If you listen to a lot of movie scores, you'll probably notice that parts of the score have similarities with Star Trek and/or Star Wars. As you're watching the movie you may notice that certain elements have that same feel of Star Trek or Wars. It's a nice touch that may or may not have been intended.It's a great soundtrack for a great movie; an excellent addition to any CD library."
4,"Not quite what I expected, but it works!","I guess from the picture I assumed that the lemon would be contained inside of this gadget--I was wrong. First you cut off one end of the lemon for about a coin sized diameter. You literally screw in the top pour spout(which has a threaded neck) into the top of a lemon. There is a small cup which is just meant for the lemon to rest on. The threaded neck essentially cores out the lemon which allows juice to pool there. So when you look at the picture, think of a whole lemon sitting in between those two pieces."
3,TOMORROW NEVER CAME,"To be fair; I had first heard this song done by Barry Manilow, and his rendition stirred me to near tears. Upon hearing there was an 'original' version, I immediately set out and purchased it as a 'single'.Its nice. Its not thrilling, it does not elicit the same emotional stirring that Manilow's concert version did, but I will not knock this version of it either. It just wasn't as powerful as the Barry's version.If you want to hear this song done in true majestic fashion, and in such a way as it will stir your emotional pot, maybe even squeeze out a few tears - try Barry Manilow's version from the two cd set: One Night in Jersey."
3,RONAN KEATING,I LOVE THE SONG BUT THIS WASN'T RELLY WHAT I THOUGHT. I BOUGHT ALSO THE OTHER ALBUM OF HIS AND IT'S FANTASTIC
3,average,"This workout needed to be longer. I would have then given it 5 stars. I am advanced so the high impact is what I need, bet for longer than 20 minutes. I will do it again and just do it with my tredmill, stairclimber, bike or another tape like I did today."
3,Some Good Travel Material,"There's some insightful, inspiring material on travel in this book. I read it while traveling from Massachusetts to Louisiana on the open road, which added to the flavor of the event. I love the road anyway. Connecting with another road lover was a bonus. That's how I recommend reading it, i.e., while traveling.While some of the insight is useful, in other places, Primeau has a very skewed perspective and his interpretation is totally bogus. In some places he over analyzes and takes things way too seriously. So that him in context. Enjoy some of what he says and disregard the rest."
1,Kodak lens adapter,"Unfortunately, we're not able to use this lens adapter as it does not fit our camera. I purchased the item in November as a Christmas gift for my fiance. So we didn't discover it was the wrong adapter until after he opened the gift on Christmas Day and after the 30 days return policy. However, after calling to explain the situation, we were informed that we would receive a credit, but not how to return the item (we haven't received a credit yet). We're also not able to locate the correct lens adapter for our Kodak DX4330 digital camera (even tried eBay and the only one available that we placed a bid was soon withdrawn)!"
3,"Of some interest, but also disappointing","Katha Pollitt is certainly a better writer when, as an essayist, she is discussing issues of Women's choices in contemporary society. This book is just a bit disappointing when having read her journalism and essays, but one shouldn't hold that against her. I found the shorter poems to be the most interesting, and risk taking."
2,jesi's thoughts,"Since I hate books where there is a conspiracy it wasn't on my `Have to Read' list. I understand that Ivy and Maddie are enemies, but what Ivy did was totally harsh. I mean she practically ruined Madison's life! I also thought that the way Fiona, Aimee, and Lindsey blocked out Madison was harsh too. I would totally trust my friend if she said she didn't do it."
2,Not really doing anything,"I tried it, it is hard to apply and washes off quickly. Doesn't work for me unfortunately! I use a white nail polish pen instead for french manicure, lasts and easy to apply!"
1,A complete wast of money.,This product does absolutely nothing for my nails. Can't even tell I've used it. Save your money and don't bother buying this..
1,I was hoping for more,"While this book had many photos of different breeds, I was surprised at the omissions. I had hoped to see a Fila Brasilero, Havanese, Dogue de Bordeaux and a Neapolitan Mastiff. The Coonhounds, both the red and black and tan were also missing. There was no mention of the American Eskimo dog. The picture of the Rhodesian Ridgeback did not show the ridge that they are so famous for. The information about the dogs contradicted other books and my own experience. I was disappointed in this book."
1,Egg and Pancake molds,Nice idea...but does not work. The egg and pancake just stuck to the mold and needed cut out. Sorry....good idea...doesn't work.JK
5,Awesome!!,"They're so cute, and fun!! Very solid too.. and the nonstick is awesome! Highly recommend!"
1,Hard to use......,"I tried this with pancakes & eggs, greased it well & it still just didn't work right."
3,Works pretty well.,"Unlike the silcone versions, these metal ones stay flat when they get hot. The sides still aren't tall enough unless you're very careful not to put in too much batter."
2,I didn't like these as much as my silicone molds,I have these pancake/egg rings and I do not like them as much as my silicone ones. The arms are hard to pull up and I can already notice a little rust on the screw where it attaches to the mold. I still use it but I can now say I prefer using silicone molds much better.
2,Not a good one as I thought,"This is funny shape but actually larger than a normal egg, so this would cause egg to flow under it and not a shape at last. And hard to clean too!! Don't buy it or choose a smaller one. Although most fry pan's bottom are not flat so hard to keep the shape unless you put eggs(I mean more than one egg) first and the use this product to cut."
3,Egg rings,Not bad but some of egg will run under the ring but can't be helped I suppose . Perhaps if they had lined the bottom of the ring with something soft it might act like a 'gasket' & kept the egg inside of the ring -who knows?
2,THIS IS NOT NON-STICK,"As everyone else has complained about..THIS IS NOT NON-STICK. I repeat: THIS IS NOT NON-STICK. One more time..say it with me: THIS IS NOT NON-STICK!!!! The problem? You're gonna have a really hard time flipping those pancakes if they're stuck inside the rings. I had to try to cut them out with a knife, but they looked pathetic. Some good pancakes were sacrificed. Lets have a moment of silence for them. What's worse than making pancakes? Making eggs. It'll just fall apart. I lost all of my eggs. My poor babies. They turned into such a scrambled mess. HOWEVER, for the price, I suppose you get what you paid for. I used them once, and I've already stuffed them in some drawer where they'll never see the light of day again. Oh, one good thing: they're fairly shiny and smooth when they first arrive. Just don't ever try to use them and they can keep their pretty allure."
2,Not totally transparent,"The cup is nice. However, beware, while the seller shows the cup with the saucer, the saucer is not included. I was very surprised, unpleasantly I might add."
4,i like this cd,ilikejazzand technoand dub and hiphop and soulbebop 690am and dj assault. this is one of the better techno cds.
3,About 2/3 of a concept album,"Craig attempts a concept album but the concept washes out about 2/3 of the way through. However, the first half (plus ""People Make the World Go 'Round"") is brilliant, especially ""The Beginning of the End"" and ""Blakula"", for different reasons - the former features an MC reacting, in something approaching an American version of the Jamaican toasting style, to the happenings in the studio and therefore heightening the tension, and the latter patiently allows the violist to expound. The second half of the disc is less remarkable as a whole due to the similarity of the tracks, and due to Craig's annoying ability to smooth over every bit of roughness in the performances."
3,"C'mon Paul, not fair","There's some okay stuff on here, but Paul breaks no new ground.Much of it also has the feel that he's goofing off, playing silly jams and singing silly lyrics which should be more for his own amusement then my $ for an import cd!"
1,wrong product,I received the wrong product. I ordered Red by Giorgio and received Giorgio by Giorgio. I do not want the product I received. I want the product that I ordered.
5,WIFE HAPPY,"PRODUCT WAS EXCELLENT ,RECEIVED IT IN A FEW DAYS ....WIFE COULDNT BE HAPPIER ....SAID I SHOULD OF GOT THE GALLON BOTTLE"
5,~~So Sweet~~,"~~~I ordered it an received it in a few days, NO PROBLEMS AT ALL!! I hate shoppin malls ~~ so this is the only way i get new items.. ~~This fragance lasts all day & everyone loves it on me..You should try it it smells so GOOD!!~~"
1,old cologne,This cologne does not smell like Red by Giorgio. It smells like it has been sitting in the bottle for 20 or more years. I will never buy cologne online again. If the price seems too good to be true there is a reason and it is usually because the product is horrible.
5,Terrific Deal for Top Notch Scent,"Red by Giogio Beverly Hills for Women is a beautiful scent and usually high priced in department stores. At Amazon you can buy at a reasonable price and have delivered to your door. The scent is beautiful and light and I always get compliments wearing it. A wonderful Valentine's Day, Mother's Day or anytime gift!"
3,Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills,"This is the EDT version of Red. Nice, but does not have the lasting fragrance of the perfume itself. I much prefer the perfume over the EDT version of Red."
3,Review of Red fragrance,This was a purchase for my wife for Christmas. She says the fragrance seems to be a little different than the store purchased item two years ago.MER
5,Best Frangrance I've Ever Worn,"I started using this fragrance several years ago, but soon found it harder and harder to get in department stores. There is now a new ""RED"" by Georgio and I don't care for it. I soon found I could purchase it on Amazon.com and have never been back to the department stores! I hope it is always available for as long as I need it! Thanks Amazon.com!!!"
1,"Great cultural info, no good travel info","Huge book, full of great insights into the culture and broad descriptions of surrounding points of interest. However, there is no useful information on hotels, eateries, modes of travel between places (other than comments like: 24 trains per day between puson and seoul [paraphrased sample, don't have book in front of me]). Very dense and difficult to navigate the book to find what you are looking for.If you want Korean cultural information, in depth, on wherever you plan to go in Korea, this is the right book. Otherwise, steer clear."
4,"Give it time, it does work","Just remember, enzymes and other medicines, etc. take time to come through the scalp and affect our hair. The strongest affect is noticed on the new hair growing out. Atfter 3 months of giving Catalase a try, this seems to be lightening my gray hairs back to my natural color of dark blond (I have noticable, but sporadic greying, not any heavy areas of entire grey). More importantly though, I am getting compliments on my hair and I haven't changed anything else! It seems shinier and brighter somehow. So I'm keeping up with it!"
2,Uninspiring,"I read all the way to the end hoping that the protagonist and his soul-mate would learn some higher value than selfishness. Nope. ""Nothing took precedence over"" satisfying one's ""own best interests."" An unsurprising and uninspiring product of the Me Decade."
3,Good if you don't read the whole middle section!,"I was shocked to find that so many people enjoyed this book. I was very interested at first of course. Who wouldn't be? The main character dies in the first section. I enjoyed the replays until it got to about the 3rd one. Once, twice was enough. It took me forever to get into it after the 3rd replay. It dragged on, and I found the characters to be annoying. However, I will admit there was a great ending to it. One, I won't soon forget, but I would rather forget the 200 pages in between."
3,Eerie is right.,"""Ken Grimwood was working on a sequel to Replay when he died from a heart attack in 2003 at the age of 59.""Perhaps next time he'll be able to finish it."
5,I'm better for having read it,"Replay was quite easily one of the most profound and compelling books I've ever read. It attained all the accolades anyone would want to hear about a book. What's more, it tugs unrelentlessly at yout heart, mind and soul. I couldn't put it down and was truly sad when it ended. It made me rethink the theme over and over again in my mind and had me reevaluating my own life and direction. How much more could you ask of a novel? I read maybe 3-4 novels a month and found this to be a life changing tome. Do yourself a favor and read Replay now. If you enjoy it (and love baseball) I would recommend to you Darryl Brock's ""If I Ever Come Back""."
4,"Outstanding, possibly life changing, could be more polished","While the writer is not a polished expert the story moved me to make some changes in how I view life. I'm moving quickly toward middle age and have spent much time thinking, ""If I only knew then what I know now."" I think Replay made me realize that it wouldn't matter, that life is what you make it in the here and now and there is no gaurantee that you would live it better given a second, or third or fourth chance.....It made it clear that there is no sense dwelling on how your life might have been at the expense of the life that IS. This is a MUST read, especially if you are in your mid 30's onward."
5,A realistic view of reliving your life.,"It is the best novel I have read, and I love reading. It deals with the subject realistically, if you can do that with this. The author does a great job of keeping things moving, not letting the reader get bogged down into details, which would be easy, but to give a great story, and a protagonist that everyone can identify with. I just wish I knew how to e-mail or where I could send a letter to the author to thank him for writing this."
5,The Best Novel I've Ever Read!,"I purchased this book back in the 1980's, and I will not part with it. It is the best novel I've ever read. I re-read it every few years. What a wonderfully written book and what an intriguing story. I have always felt this book should be made into a movie. Why hasn't that happened yet? If you are looking for a book that keeps you glued to the pages and imagining how you would do things differently if you could go back and 'do it all over again'.... you'll love this book."
5,What a great way to play with time!,"Was unaware of this book until I read a review on another forum. What a great way to play around in time. Wow, I was up late reading this one!"
5,What a pleasant surprise!,"My brother handed me this book and told me to read it. I'd never heard of Ken Grimwood, but complied with his request. What a delightful surprise! The book held my attention all the way through, and I could not even guess at where it would head next. I worried that the book would just end and not wrap things up -- but I was wrong. The ending was a surprise to me, but wrapped things up very well. I am now on a quest to read the rest of Ken's books. I highly recommend this book and I am not a fantasy or sci-fi fan."
5,"What would you do with your life if you had a dozen ""do-overs""?","This is a very interesting story that I first read years ago. Liken it to the popular movie ""Groundhog Day"" in which the lead character relives the same day over and over. At first there is puzzelment and awe at what has happened, then elation at the uniqueness of it. As it happens over and over again he goes from puzzelment to joy to frustration to anger to depression until he finally realizes that this is an unbelievable opportunity to do good. And it is in doing good that he finds resolution. ""Replay"" is similar except the lead character is reliving ever shortening years of his life. A very good incite into the human mind and what leds a person to make choices about how to live their lives. I often thought this would be a great movie for Scott Bakula to make."
4,Like Groundhog day over decades,"I read this about 3 years ago and enjoyed the author's take on living life over with full knowledge of his future.I don't want to put in any spoilers here, because it's fun to let it all unfold. Just enjoy his take on what the character chooses to do with his past and his ""replay"". It's not the best sci-fi or time-travel sort of concept I've read, but it is fresher than most, and was a fun and fast-paced story that I've shared with a lot of folks since reading it.The fact that the author, Ken Grimwood, died while working on a sequel is both sad and a little weird, given his age at the time and the general plot of this book... or at least I thought so.Wish there could have been a sequel."
4,truly an enjoyable read,"I enjoyed the plot of the story, the ideas that came out of it, and quotes of bhagavad gita. The writing is doing well, a very easy read."
5,Must read,"For any fan of sci fi, this is a modern masterpiece. The simple time travel aspect is thrown on it's head when instead of changing a single event, the main character instead can change an entire lifetime. One part Jack Kerouac, one part Back to the Future, and one part environmental philosophy... Replay is a page turner I highly reccomend."
4,"Good, fun read","i read this book many years ago, and forgot all about it. Them when I remembered something, I could not rememer who wrote it or the title. Glad I did, it was a fun, easy read. You can read above what the story is about. I would LOVE to see the same thing, but going from 2002 back to 1972. Would be cool"
4,"Fun, fascinating adventure of ""what ifs:?","I first read this book about 5 years ago, and passed it along to a friend-- was so taken with the concept that I bought it again--- and again passed it along to a friend. Finally bought it for a 3rd time... (Am I in a replay here?) I'll hang on to it this time. A fascinating exploration of the concept ""what if you could live your life over, knowing all you already know?"" A good, one-sitting book. Even my friend Abby (who usually takes months to finish a book) stayed awake long enough to read it in three days!Nancy Moore"
5,One of my favorites,"I read this book back in the early 90's. My sister lent me her copy and told me I had to read it. I absolutely loved it. Over the last 10 years I've thought about different parts of the book occasionally; considering a lot of the what ifs. I realized recently that Amazon probably had a copy and I'd really like to own it and re-read it. And now I'll have my husband to read it too. I'm surprised no one has made a movie from it yet, but I'm glad they haven't. I doubt they would do it justice. I highly recommend this book (along with a long and distinguished list of others.)"
5,Replay reading Over and Over thru the decades,I first read this book and was unable to find it again after I moved. This book changed my outlook on life and the future.If you have not read REPLAY - READ IT NOW!!!
4,Grimwood's REPLAY: Premise and Message Top notch,"The premise of ""Replay"" is original and provocative, yet its moral message is even more powerful. The phrase, ""If I knew then what I know now, I would have done things a whole lot different,"" takes on a new meaning as the hero uses his knowledge of the past to change his history and of those around him (and not always for the better). For a relatively underground sleeper of a novel, ""Replay"" has what it takes to be up there with the ranks of a Steven King concepts like ""Talisaman."" ""Replay"" would make an excellent stage play and/or movie. Justin P."
3,Replay visited,"I was interested in this book after hearing a review on PRI and thought the it might have a profound plot. As I began reading the story seemed quite shallow but as I kept reading it slowly became more and more deeply involved in some serious thought.The tale is interesting and causes one to think about one's own life and what he/she coulda, woulda, shoulda done with it.The plot moves right along without a lot of description of ""scenery."" The dialog is to the point and helps keep the story moving ahead.It was a ""good"" read."
5,Awesome time travel book,"A friend loaned me this book in 1990 and I finished it in just a couple of days. I hated having to give it back. I have spent the last 14 years looking for this book again. I had forgotten the title and author but never forgot the story line or the characters. Surfing through Amazon helped me find the book. I can definitely recommend this as a fascinating read. Just allowing you to escape every day life and wonder what would you do if you had the chance to live your life over is worth it. The plot invokes all kinds of imaginative thoughts.I can also recommend Jack Finney's ""Time and Again""."
4,Plenty here to contemplate,"I will say this for ""Replay"", it does provide plenty of fodder for thought and discussion. The question of what you would do if your could live your life over with all your present knowledge intact is both fascinating and gut-wrenching. So for story idea itself ""Replay"" gets high marks. The writing however does tend to get bogged down in a new-age eighties kind of way. There were certainly some ""cringe worthy"" passages that unfortunaly left the story with a rather dated feel to it. That said it's still worth a read and does provide much to ponder. 3.5 stars"
5,THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK!,I borrowed and read this book several years ago. To this day I have been searching for it to buy and have for my own. I recommend it to EVERYONE! A facinating premise.. This book will never leave me..
5,Words aren't enough!,"The real test of a work's worth for the casual reader is to ask yourself ""Do I want to read this again?"" If you are like most people, only a handful of books will fit into this category. Sometimes it is the work itself but mostly it is about the time in your life and the impact it made on you. On both accounts, guilty. Ken Grimwood passed away while working on a sequel to this book - ironically of a heart attack which was how the protagonist meets his end, only to be reborn time and time again. I can only hope that the sketch of his sequel might find it's way to publication through the sensitive hand af a writer who has also drawn inspiration from this compelling and insightful tome."
5,Great Premise that delivers,"Looking at the reviews, I see there are of Replay fans, so I guess I'll just chime in with the rest. I got this book witout knowing anything about it and was amazed with how good it just kept getting. Great premise (I loved Groundhog Day too), but there are also some twists and turns that keep the story evolving in unexpected but satisfying ways. The author delivers a nice ending that totally fits.... Then, I spent the next few days thinking about how I would replay my life (the bets, the stock picks), as well as maybe coming away with a bit more appreciation for the life I have and have left."
4,more than time travel,"Just finished this today. I have struggled in the past to finish sci-fi books, usually finding the characterizations flat. That doesn't apply here though as well rounded emotive characters take their part in the well structured and imaginative creative idea. I disagree with the complaint that it makes the jumps too quick - I enjoyed that aspect, that we the readers learn about the new situation as the protagonist does.Provokes much thought, beyond the usual time travel paradoxes (is that the plural?)."
4,A Good Read,I would never have chosen this type of book...not my usual read but it was my book club's selection. Suprise! I liked it. It held my attention and there's a lot to think about in this book. I would recommend this for anyone who is interested in science fiction. (welll..maybe not hard core science fiction aficionados)
3,"Not bad, but could use a little help","I'm a fan of science fiction, especially having to do with time travel. The premise needn't be scientifically accurate, but MUST have consistency. The author misses it in a few places, which I won't recount, because I am definitely not suggesting that anyone should pass by this story. Besides, it's not an uncommon failing. Even Michael Crichton was sometimes guilty of it. ""Replay"" was an entertaining read, which I enjoyed, but an author who does it more to my liking is Oscar Nash in his novel ""Next Time"". If you liked ""Replay"", you'll be captured by ""Next Time""."
3,Intriguing concept but flawed,"Pluses: The book holds your attention. The concept of going back in time and reliving your life appeals to everyone, and that author deftly explores the different lives we might live if we had this opportunity. This philosophical musings on the challenge of finding human happiness, and of having any control over our own lives, emotions, and those around us is also very interesting, as is book's take on the unpredictability of human behavior. Highly appealing to anyone who's lived or especially grown up in the sixties, seventies and eighties.Minuses: The dialogue does not sound real; it's pseudo-intellectual, and every character seems to speak in a similar voice. As a result, the characters are quite flat and static, there is no emotional evolution. The take on the futility of human life is quite dark and tiresome. The book is also heavy-handed in its musings and jumps too often from one time period to the next, skipping years."
3,"Good,but cannot match ""Time and Again"" and the follow up to it.","TIME AND AGAIN by Jack Finney is the sort of book that lasts in one's mind always. This book is a good page turner,but does not evoke the kind of thoughts and feelings that the Finney book does. And if you do read the Finney, be sure to also read the follow up book,which name I cannot remember. It is like a continuation to ""Time."" I also have read his other books,but sadly, they do not match up in my opinion."
2,Something Went Terribly Wrong,"This story begins well enough and the author delivers much promise as to what will come, but something goes terribly wrong along the way and it becomes more self-serving to the author than promising to the reader. It left me with nothing to think about and because the characters were so self serving, I really didn't care what happened to them. By the way, this was a book club suggestion and I couldn't possibly recommend it for a book club selection, although it may provide an interesting discussion regarding the why of it all. I will say no more in that regard for those of you who wish to go ahead and read it for yourselves."
3,Not bad - eBook price is too expensive,Over all not a bad book (i didn't care for the love story twist) i think $9.99 for a 300 page eBook is a little much... hence the 3 stars.
2,An average book with an average plot,"The initial premise is strong: What would you do if you lived your life over and over? But that is the end of the big surprises. After that some fairly pedestrian writing and flat dialog left me wanting more. There is a lot better science fiction out there. And unlike the movie Groundhog Day, I didn't want to relive the story over and over, I just wanted it over. Somewhat disappointing after all the glowing reviews."
1,Dialogue straight from a poorly written soap opera,"The basic plot is interesting enough, and there are plenty of reviewers who described it well enough... my beef is with the characters' dialogue! Much of it could be right at home in a paperback romance... Halfway through the book I began laughing aloud, and it wasn't during any intentionally funny parts. It's as if Mr. Grimwood intermittently handed his manuscript over to a 16-year-old wannabe soap opera writer and said, ""Take it away!"" Stuff like, ""He breathed into her tawny hair,"" and the woman coyly asking the main character, ""Why aren't you looking at the scenery,"" followed by his ogling, ""I AM...""Ugh! After that I pretty much skimmed through the rest of the book to get to the resolution without my eyes rolling out of my head."
4,Replay,"This was an enjoyable and thought provoking read. It reminded me a bit of the movie The Butterfly Effect, which I also enjoyed."
4,Replay,"Replay was a captivating read. Once I started reading , I wanted to keep reading, even though we were visiting with friends."
5,You simply need to read this book.,"While an overwhelming majority of the reviews for Grimwood's ""Replay"" are favorable, I was shocked to see a few that weren't. I guess it's because they are possibly too young to ""get it"". This book is a wonder. It would make the most incredible movie, but doubt anyone would ever attempt it. It's simply got too much content to be condensed to 2 hours. To do Replay justice, the movie would have to be about 6 hours. If someone could figure it out, and do it right, it would be a block buster for all ages."
2,Sci Fi book or New Age mumbo jumbo?,"I read and read and read through all of the different Lives this character ""Replayed"" and yes, it was interesting but I was really hoping for a Big Payoff; to find out why exactly this was occuring but We never do and I felt cheated because of this.Instead we get some convuluted thing about appreciating what we have when we have it.That just didnt do it for me."
2,"Ok, just rather slow....","After reading the reviews here, I was ready for a great book. Unfortunately, I found myself rather bored after the first loop and almost left it on the plane 1/2 way through. (Ending up finishing it on the return flight since our movie was broken).The concept of exploring alternative ways your could live your life is quite intriguing, but the story didn't click for me. Believable characters, just dull.Of course, I generally like fast-paced techno thrillers and this was a slow, drawn-out, very non-technical drama. I would've much preferred if the bad guy they meet was much more intertwined throughout the plot to at least explore different perspectives on replaying one's life."
2,Too gritty,"This book has an exciting premise, but I felt like I was slogging through too much muck. It is very gritty with superfluous swearing. It doesn't add to the story and it drags one down. Not an easy read."
1,Must have missed something,"I noticed that the first couple of reviewers state that they are not big science fiction readers, but found the story line interesting, intriguing... so on and so forth.Well I am a science fiction reader, a science fiction watcher (movies and tv) and a complete computer geek and this book really doesn't do anything impressive.I may be the 252 reviewer for this book, I think it needs to be said.I have seen/read this same material handled with much more humor and emotion than this book covered. A very simple example would be StarGate SG-1's episode where they are stuck in a time loop.There are parts of this book that were simply just not interesting and others that are trite. This book did not cover anything interesting, or add anything original to the concept of traveling back in time.My final comment = If Back to the Future were made into a book, it would be infintely more interesting than this book."
1,A Dull Addition to a Tired Genre,"Why? Why does one bother to create a story like this; one cliched before conception, as predictable as ""Titanic,"" trite as the latest 20th Century Fox romantic comedy. Worst of all, though, it is BORING! I finished the 300+ pages, yes, but only because I was compelled by my significant other, whom I have yet to forgive.The story's main character learns to charish time, and not to waste any precious moments, despite the quanity. I learned the same."
1,got bored with it right away...,...and put it down. No sense of wonder. HG Wells' *Time Machine* had it in spades; Jack Finney had it too. I'm easily bored.
5,Hands down-Phenomenal!,"First off, I am a compulsive reader. If you will only read one book in your entire life read REPLAY! It is a completely captivating, entrancing read. It has great character development, an awseome plot, and the ending is to die for. Nothing else needs to be said."
4,It Really Is A Wonderful Life,This book takes the reliving your life again with full wisdom to its ultimate ends with superb detail. All of the characters' experiences are explored with such wonderful detail you are drawn completely into the fantasy. This book is great fun.
3,Ok but could've been more,"Such a great idea for a book. What I missed most were the subtleties on which he only marginally touched and the joy the main character would've felt if he just kicked back and enjoyed the ride. He never ONCE just submitted himself to the fates, he kept whining or rebelling. Also the one replay where he decided to go public was just stupid, one would think he'd be wiser at that point.It seemed obvious to me that this book was written to option, it read like a movie and never did get too deep into the philosophy one would expect."
4,"Thought-provoking, gripping, and unique","This is a wholly different type of time-travel book that will really make you think about metaphysical issues in your life. Roads not taken, decisions done differently, avenues unexplored; how often do we all muse over these matters and wish we could redo them?This captivating novel takes a fantasy we all have--reliving our own past--and weaves into it more substantial questions about human existence, kindred spirits, and the nature of time. Although I was slightly frustrated by a couple of loose ends left unexplored, I will recommend this to any of my circle who have the imagination and curiosity to appreciate it."
4,Excellent and Unique,I picked this book on a whim in a used book store and thought the premise was so unique. Its a cross between Peggy Sue Got Married and Groundhog Day but with a much darker side. As other peopel said the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does have the tendency to drag on after the 2nd replay. I still recommedn this book 100% and suggest that the slow parts are read through so the ultimate conclusion can come out.
1,Cloth already torn after only a little over a year.,Bought this 16 months ago and the cloth is already torn. I replaced the last one which lasted a decade and this one is already crap. Do not buy this if you want to have to replace it again in a year.
3,Comfort is in the bu... Well you understand,"The quality of this seat seems to be fine. It's sturdy. But I'm not impressed with the comfort, but that may be because I'm coming from my stock Trek hybrid seat which was a bit bigger and fully sprung. What I really don't like is the spandex covering. I wasn't expecting that and it's just not as comfortable for me as a leather or even leather-like covering."
2,Would that I could get back those minutes I squandered,"There's cult schlock that I appreciate and then there's just schlock. As soon as I saw JJ Walker appear, I knew the deal was sunk. As the potential enjoyment of the film lay bleeding profusely at my feet, Mark Hamill arrived on scene and kicked it in its head. I gave it 2 stars because it had its moments and Jeffrey Combs was in it. He had a bit part but he just cheers me with his presence."
1,The Anime Guyver was great but the live version [is bad]!,"I love the Anime version of the guyver. But this movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I mean they took a great concept like the guyver and made it into a B movie. If you have watched the anime series don't watch this movie. The backstreet boys scare me more than the monsters in this thing did. If you have watched this movie and are thinking about getting the anime series do it, its like 100x better.I have said my peace..."
2,"Bad ... ""Watchable Bad"" though","I just want to be as clear as humanly possible. This is NOT a good movie by any standards. The actings awful, the script is terrible, the costumes are goofy looking, the score and music are low-rent. The whole film's production value was somewhere around an above-average 'Power Rangers' episode.Having said all of that, this is a rare instance where the film not only accepts its cheesyness but seems to embrace it. I was actually suprised the production team didn't try and get a PG rating. It would have made a good post-Saturday morning cartoon movie.If you were looking for a good 'B' movie to entertain yourself with, this fits the bill. Any movie with Jimmy ""Dyn-No-Mite"" Walker in it is always going to be entertaining on SOME level."
3,Good enough to see for yourself,"I liked this movie because it is one of a kind (knowing that there is a Guyver 2) and it has set a standard for other movies that might be similar to it. If you liked this movie then you should see the second Guyver movie, it is better."
2,Director's Cut,This movie could have had three stars with a Director's Cut. With an addtional few minutes of film Janet Jackson could have done a duet with JJ's rapping alien. The big finale could have been Horseshack break dancing.
4,It's about time...,"For all of us who have long awaited the release of this classic you might be wondering why not 5-stars-I actually would've rated it 4-1/2 but that option wasn't available. Anyway, the reason behind the rating is a minor technicality...the producers of this release decided to improve upon what was already a fantastic cartoon. The intro & outro's have been change from the original theme songs to something more reminiscent of the Spiderman cartoons,(bad move). In addition, the audio tends to be a little be a little flat, no doubt a result of digital reproduction, so while you can understand the characters a little better the end result is the characters sound like they have a cold. That aside, this is still one of the best anime series out there, and a must for any collector. I just recommend that if you're a parent purchasing for your child, this is true Japanimation not Pokemon. Violence is everywhere.:)"
3,OK but Guyver 2 and the anime are better,"I liked it alot at first cause I'm a fan of the anime, and it was cool to see the Guyver in live action. But this is more like a spoof than an adaptation. Kinda like the 60s Batman show.Pros: the action is hot. The Guyver does some cool martial arts. Plus his bladed weapons looked cool. And if you're into the comical action this movies for you. Plus there are alot of guest stars from horror fame.Cons: Too campy. The cover is misleading: When I first saw it I thought Hamill was playing the Guyver, he's actually not. He plays an FBI agent. The acting is pretty bad, except for Hamill who did an OK job.If you're more of a fan of serious action monster flicks, get Guyver 2."
2,"This movie is a good ,but not very","I mean c'mon. Mark dies at the end!You don't kill the real star of any movie! His performance was just as superb as always. Wish I could that about everyone else in the movie. I hate to say it, but this movie is definately the one that took down Hamill's career."
1,What the hell happened????,"The guyver, what the hell happened. The orignal anime and comic book story had totaly been stripped away and what was left, a crap no action camp American film. The suit looked crap and the zoanoids?? Come on the story is there but the way the director goes about the film kills it. Oh and mark hamill, stick with luke my boy, at least he dosent turn into a cockroach at the end of the film."
2,What did I just watch?,"So I'm sitting on my couch and this movie just came on the action channel. I turned on about 45 minutes into it and I immediately said to myself, ""Wow, this looks like the lamest movie I will ever see. I am intrigued!"" So I watched it and sure enough, it was incredibly cheesy. For the year and their budget, the costumes were pretty sweet. I mean, I don't think I could've made anything any better. Gwar could, but that's another story. The fight scenes were almost as bad as the acting and the Jimmy Walker alien rapping was painful. All that being said, I still watched the last hour or so of the movie and as stupid as it was, it was entertaining. The Zoalord was pretty cool--he was some kind of giant,alien, antelope/praying mantis half breed. I'd have to say that my favorite part of the movie was the very last scene because Jimmy Walker alien was smoking a blunt with a black guy and that's just fantastic. What an ending."
2,It was ok...but the Anime are a lot better,"I remember when I was 10 I first watched this and I thought it was great then I saw the sequel which I thought was cool too. Couple years later though I saw all the anime and it was a lot better than this. If you really want to know anything about the Guyver story line, seriously stick to the Anime and Manga(which I never read but was the origin of this so it has to be better) The suits in the first and second film did look cool but it doesn't overcome the bad acting and horrible plotline they cover. It's not even scratching the surface of what the guyver has to offer. I highly suggest grabbing the Anime."
3,Guyver a masterpiece in its own,Many people do not understand these types of films..they are not meant to be Award Winning films Guyver was made a little goofy on purpose. the creatures and designs were tha creation of Steve Wang the director and master creature creator responsible for the Predator Alien and many others. You have to respect the movie simply for the creatures look at the detail. I think pulling off guys in foam suits looking beleivable is truly an art form when done right. I praise this movie for its creatures and FX
3,The Guyver rules!,"The guyver sounded cool when someone told me about it,but when I rented it I had to get it!It rules!His suit is awsome! END"
4,Essential for all Guyver fans,"This film is not as good as the second one, but it is still a pretty decent one, for a film that uses rubber costumes. Worth watching for the action sequences."
5,Superb!,"This is the best movie I've seen in awhile. Quite Honestly, I thought it was beter than Star Wars"
3,Is that Luke Skywalker?,"It is and he turns into an alien. Pretty bad movie adaptation from the manga series. but most are. its very dark, not much light, but if you like the series then you may like the movie."
1,WHY??,"What is wrong with this movie? They should have left it as anime. I don't think that they even saw the first five series, and decided to go by word of mouth on this one. The only good thing about this movie was maybe the Guyver suit(Reason for the one star). Other than that this movie sucked. The second one faired slightly better."
3,cheesy but Ok.,"i got to say this was like watching power rangers, it was humor filled action movie, cheesy special effects but not that bad,story was ok and the acting is another story, all in all like the other reviews have i would really recommend the SEQUEL GUYVER 2 DARK HERO."
3,Greatest Hits,This must be a greatest hits album because the songs are on their three other albums. Don't buy it if you have their other albums.
3,merely a greatest hits album...,"If you've never listened to Secret Garden before, buy this album... it is a compilation of favorites from their first three albums. Great music. THAT SAID, current fans will be severely disappointed with this effort. This can't be the ""new album"" SG speaks of on their website. If you are making a Greatest Hits album, fine, say so. But don't try and fool loyal fans into thinking you've created a new album and spending money on it when you have not. List it as a greatest-hits collection. For new fans: 5 stars. For old fans: 1 star."
5,I wish Secret Garden was not so secret,"The Dreamcatcher CD is a 'best of' of several Secret Garden CD's. I like the music so much that I have been buying copies to give to my sister and my children. My sister says that she plays it over and over again. It's a shame that more people have not heard of them, but I guess that their genre (New Age) does not get any airplay on most radio stations dedicated to rock, country, etc., although Josh Groban did get a lot of airplay when he covered their ""You Raise Me Up"" song (from their ""Once In A Red Moon"" CD). I think that you should at least preview the songs on this CD to see how excellent they are.If you like this music, you should also try music by David Arkenstone (especially his double CD ""Visionary""), and Keiko Matsui (like her ""Deep Blue"", ""Whisper From The Mirror"", ""Dream Walk"", and ""No Borders"" (originally titled ""The Wind And The Wolf"") CDs)."
5,I absolutely love this album!,"This is the first album I've ever bought by Secret Garden. I understand from the other reviews that this is basically a ""greatest hits"" album, which may be disappointing for fans waiting for new material. But for me, having never heard them before, this was the perfect album for me to experience - and I am completely in LOVE! The melodies are haunting and beautiful and they stay with me. I play this album when I am working on a painting or relaxing with a cup of herbal tea after work. Each song touches me in a different way. If you've never heard Secret Garden before - this is the place to start!"
3,Dreamcatcher ~ Secret GArden,"I was expecting to buy a new CD of Secret Garden music. When I put the CD into the car player I said, ""Wait I've heard this song before.""I would appreciate the artists and manufacturers telling us that we are buying a collection of previously released music. I feel I've been betrayed and clipped for and undue amount of money.Next time I hear of a new release, I'll be more careful and read the entire CD notes."
5,from Solo Piano Publications,"""Dreamcatcher"" is a ""best of"" compilation of eighteen tracks from Secret Garden's first three albums plus one new ""bonus"" track recorded for an upcoming feature film in Korea. If Secret Garden is new to you, this is a great introduction to this exciting duo. Longtime fans will be delighted to find their favorites on one CD. ""Dreamcatcher"" truly indicates the range and versatility of Fionnuala Sherry and Rolf Lovland as composers as well as musicians. Drawing on influences from Celtic, Norwegian folk, new age, and classical music, Secret Garden's pieces tend to be on the melancholy, bittersweet side, but the rousing anthem ""Dawn of a New Century"" proves that this group has no limitations or boundaries. From breathy, ethereal vocals to various instrumental ensembles big and small to full-blown symphonic pieces, this CD will both soothe and excite, and will take the listener on a satisfying musical journey. Highly recommended!"
4,::: Beautiful composition :::,"I got familiar with this CD after getting a recommendation from Enya's fan.The only similar thing I found between Secret Garden and Enya is the Celtic roots.Secret Garden music is more an instrumental pieces than songs. In their web site, they describes their creation as ""music to a film not yet seen"". I think it a perfect definition to the experience you have when you listen to this CD.This album is a special compilation album that was released in the US. The album is a selection of tracks from Secret Garden's former three CDs, including one new bonus track called ""The Present"" from the Korean film with the same name.I found it very emotional, enchanting and relaxing. Gentle, moody rhythms and colorful sound that combined together into a musical kaleidoscope. Beautiful spiritual journey."
2,buyer beware!,"Before you purchase this CD, do your homework. I am an avid ""Secret Garden"" fan and assumed this was their most current release with all new songs. While acting in haste, after purchasing it, I was disappointed to discover that this is simply a compilation of their other CD's plus 1 added bonus song, which I considered to be of insignificant value. All fans would welcome some refreshing NEW material, although if you do not already own any of their recordings, this is a sufficient introduction to a great group."
3,Get the individual CD's,"The is no single theme running through this one album. One of the great thigns about the previous Secret Gardens albums is that there is on coherent theme running through each album, I felt like they were telling a story.Even though this is a compilation of some of the group's best work, but a ""compilation"" just feels disjointed, lacking cohesiveness.I would recommend buying the individual CD's instead.And one more thing, some of the traditional Irish ballads on this CD are annoying. Though there are only about 3 or 4, still, they definitely do not fit into this new age CD."
5,New SG Fan!,"This is my first experience with Secret Garden's music and I am simply thrilled and excited. As I have listened more, I have fallen in love with each and every beautiful arrangement. Most of all, I don't remember having ever heard a violin ""sing"" like Fionnuala's, especially in ""Sigma"", but equally in other songs. ALL the instrumental works are exceptional - at least in my personal opinion (the vocal work is lovely too).I cannot get this music out of my head! If only I could whistle!I hope all who listen will enjoy it in their own way as well."
3,It's okay,"Like most CD's a couple of selections are very good, the others are just okay. I will not recommend this product."
5,It was a gift for my mother. She loved it.,My mother loves all kinds of music. She especially was searching for the music for night time. She said that this CD helped her to go to sleep gently.
2,Not convinced,I bought this cd some time after Tourist accidentally felt in my hands (i loved it despite i know nothing about this type of music) and I have to say it isn't at all what i expected.
4,Bleach Season 2,"In the second season of Bleach, Ichigo and friends infiltrate the soul society in order to save Rukia from execution. As Ichigo battles various other soul reapers, it gives a little background on how they know Rukia or how they became who they are today. Some battles are a little drawn out, Rukia doesn't appear very much, but the humor is still there. It's a little more serious than the first season but no less entertaining. The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because of the long drawn out battles. Some of them are downright annoying!"
5,Bleach Uncut Season 2 Bos set,"I was interested in the series which was view on TV. I enjoy collecting good anime, yet due to the economy purchasing the anime I enjoy from the retailer is not an option due to the value & price range of the items. I am gald amazon has reasonable prices & a wide range of sellers who can meet the buyers demand. More impressed with the arrive time of the my order & how well the merchandise was package with care from the seller. Many times online purchasing can be rather hesitant but I am planning to make furture purchases with amazon & its vendors."
4,awesome,My son loved this box set!!! Dvds are awesome! Only reason this didn't get a five star was because one of the disk cases was cracked.
5,great series i want the entire series,This is a great series i cant weight for the rest of the 189 episodes to come out i want the entire series
2,Keep on waiting,"Still no poster a week after it was suppose to be here. ordered it 3 weeks ago and still not here! I live in WA and i ordered a big text book from across the country and it came within a week. a stupid poster can't make it in three, this is kinda lame! I should get it for free!"
3,clinical practice guide,book price was slightly higher than expected.print were light ink and font need to be slightly bigger will appreciated.book has excellent concise material
5,Should be a requirement,"Every single RT needs something like this. Small, concise, tons and tons and tons of everyday useful information for school, clinical's and in your practice after your NBRC exams. I use it to study for the classes I have now and take it to my clincals with me everyday, there is tons of information to store in two years and all of it cant stay in your head. This is an invaluable quikc reference for everything from Assessment to ABG's to Equations and Pharm. information with the latest standards and guidelines."
3,Nice but..,"This is a great reference guide but the only thing is that when I received it it was damaged. The blue binder is cracked and falling apart you can see the cardboard inside the vinyl wrapper. Other than that, great book."
2,Don't waste your money,"I was in the market for a simple crinkle cutter because my two year old seems to prefer eating vegetables that way. This crinkle cutter does cut very well, and the handle and angle are very comfortable. However, the crinkles are so shallow you can't even tell that it was crinkled at all. It looks like it was sliced with a dull knife. I already threw this in the trash. I tried it on cucumbers, potatoes, zucchini, carrots, banana, and apple. It worked well cutting each of them, but the results of the crinkle came out the same. Don't waste your money."
1,junk,"I purchased this item and the very first time I used it,the bottom broke off of it.IT is junk,made of cheap cheap stuff."
2,Watch out,This shooting stand is very poor quality and not worth trying. It performed its job OK at first but is hard to keep steady and is flimsy at the smaller end. The unit broke after three or four uses and could not be fixed. Do your research and put a little more money into a better made unit.
2,Great until it breaks,"When I got this, I was very happy. It is hilly here and this worked as a walking stick and a shooting stick. I used it on two hunts. The third time I used it, I slipped in the snow and when I used it to catch me, it broke in half. Also, before that, the top is glued in and the glue broke and the top kept falling off. It really is junk."
1,"Nice idea, but...","I have to agree with the previous reviews that this dispensses honey way too slowly. Additionally, it is much too difficult to fill without making a mess, since you cannot have the top open without having the bottom open as well. This dispenser is just not worth the trouble and mess, no matter how great the idea."
2,Handel not Stainless Steel as described,"I just recieved my honey dispenser and was very disappointed with the plastic handel and plunger mechanism. I had to go back and read the description, and sure enough, the description said the handel was stainless steel. It's not! It's chrome coated PLASTIC. Unfortunately, if I had read the reviews, I would of picked up on that."
1,Plastic piece breaks easily,The top piece is painted to look like metal but it's actually made out of plastic. The part that lifts the plunger broke before we even got a chance to use it.
2,Tip,"Something appears to be missing to prevent the honey from dripping, Please send or tell me where to get replacement or must I return? No instructions were included, so Please contact me so I can use this great kitchen dispense ."
3,Slow dispensing,"This little jar is really cute on the counter. It doesn't leak. It is relatively easy to fill by yourself, despite the other reviews to the contrary. If you heat water for the base part and then let the honey jar sit in there for a few minutes, the honey pours put nicely. However, if you don't do that, I would estimate that it takes a full minute to get a half a teaspoon out of it. This isn't very convenient when you are trying to get ready and out of the door in the mornings. I will keep it and plan to switch it to a maple syrup dispenser since I use that less frequently and I will have time to do the hot water thing."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,lOVE THIS ITEM. My husband uses honey every morning. Now I don't have honey dripping on our counter top.
1,Dosnt keep honey!,Not easy to fill in with honey and it leaks: honey goes into water. Threw it away! So sorry! It looked so promising...
1,Junk,"This is a total miss construction! No only does it take way to long to pure the honey, when you want to refill the jar all the remaining honey runs out. Don't waste you money."
5,Awesome!,Love this kitchen gadget! We use it all the time. It is great for hot teas. Works best if you fill the bottom bowl with hot water for a few minutes to thin out the honey. Highly recommend!
1,Plastic knock-off of a nice idea.,"Problem with the one I have is that the cheap plastic plunger slips out of the rubber stopper at the bottom. Looks great but I'm looking for one with metal parts.I rate this: DO NOT BUY.I have nothing against it being plastic, per-say, it is just that the parts are not as functional the way they made them. Mine didn't break but then again, it was only functional for a day until the stopper stuck enough to the bottom to let the plunger come loose.Sadly, the description says that the cap is metal--false advertising."
1,Cheap piece of junk,"As soon as I opened the package I had a sinking feeling I'd made a mistake. The top/handle was made of some kind of faux metal/cheap plastic...""fau-tal""? ""chea-lastic""? I'm not sure what to call it. Still, I filled it with honey and started using it. TWO days later the handle broke. Mea culpa, I should know better and should have sent it back as soon as I received it."
5,Excellent product.,This is an excellent product. It was exactly what I was looking for. Would recoomend this product to all.Postage was quick.
4,No Drip Syrup Dispenser,The product is the first that I've had that doesn't drip or run down the side and that was what we were looking for. I've seen these in other catalogs for a whole lot more.
2,"Dripless, but...","I broke the bottom part of this type container (which was my son's) at his house last week when I picked it up by the handle, and the bottom part (which was temporarily stuck to the top by the honey) fell off and shattered on their tile floor. I didn't know that it wasn't supposed to be moved that way, and probably a lot of other people wouldn't know it either, so if you buy one and put it on the table to use, be sure and TELL people to lift it by the base!"
5,best kept secret,THE ONLY TRICK to this is to fill the base with a little hot water- the honey flows out fast and easy- I am a resturant owner- we serve lots of hot teas- this is the talk of the town- all other methods of serving honey were a disater!- this one saves our day!Great gift- great product
1,Near impossible to fill without creating a mess,"Bad Design! To fill, the dispense mechanism must be moved, resulting in an opening at the top of the container, in order to fill with honey, but also results in an opening at the bottom of the container where the honey dispenses. To fill, put your finger over the dispense opening, pour the honey in, using your one free hand. Then the mechanism must be reinserted, resulting in an outflow of honey! What a mess.As others have mentioned, the dispense assembly is poorly contructed with plastic, which is not mentioned as advertised in the product description."
3,Works but to slow,I wanted to get this since are other honey dispenser just had a dipper in it and it took forever. I find this to be still to slow when the honey comes out and the handle hurts holding it down for the whole time you are waiting for a decent amount of honey for a piece of toast. Honestly I would just go back to the bear full of honey you squeeze.
4,Neat Honey Dispenser!,"Best Honey dispenser, I have ever used! Keeping the water warm in the bottom ""cup"" that the dispenser sits in is just the ticket for keeping the honey flowing. Otherwise the honey has a tendency to go to sugar. But we are at a disadvantage on this one point because we use raw honey. Regular honey at the grocery store flows better. The main nice thing is that the honey does not drip and it is easy to direct the flow especially on toast! Liked it so well we bought several for our adult children as Christmas gifts."
3,Honey Syrup,"I like it except, it's smaller than I expected it to be so I end up refilling it after each use."
4,Awesome Honey Dispenser,"I bought one of these years ago and loved it. It's the unstickiest way to deal with honey I've ever found. Plus, being able to put hot water in the stand makes sure the honey always flows freely.Friends and family always raved over it and sadly, the handle eventually broke.That's when I went looking for it online and found it on amazon.Had to get 2 so I could give one as a gift to my girlfriend who talked about it every time she visited me!"
4,love it!,"I love this thing. I add honey to my yogurt. This only works with warm honey (at least well:)). I LOVE that you can put hot water in it, leave it for a min or so, and then you can mix it in wonderfully. I have had mine for 2 years, and still works great. Putting honey is a little tricky, but super easy once you get the hang of it. I have done it by myself every time, no biggie. My father in law got one at the same time, and had to send it back (why i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars) due to it leaking honey out of the bottom. Wish they made these with a stronger top, and charged a bit more for them. But mine has held up."
2,Cheap Plastic,"I was tired of pot metal or plastic syrup dispensers and decidedI would pay top bucks to get a quality item. When I found one on Amazon described by ""Amazon.com review"" as having a stainless steel lid I jumped at it. Boy what a disappointment. This syrup jar is cheaper than cheap and the so called stainless lid is nothing but chromed plastic"
3,"Great print quality, but...",...unfortunately these cartridges often stop printing even when they have has much as 80% of the ink left (as shown in the printer status display). Typically the print head on the cartridge becomes clogged with ink and no amount of careful cleaning will restore their functioning.
3,1960's special effects,"Picture perfectly digitally restored. Disappointed that the story is not based in my opinion on any real historical event; the target, a French coast harbor whose name does not exist either- Le Clairé. Little mention of the implicit Canadian role except by the obvious uniforms. Bridges kind of overdoes it, acting wise. Would have loved to see a little bit more of Sue Lloyd! Original if not amusing depiction of higher ranked German military movie watching. After watching it once, will give it to another WW2 buff - not worth keeping in my DVD collection."
1,Iron coast attack poor showing,"This movie plays during world war two, and that's the ONLY reason it's labeled a war movie. The real theme seems to be more in the psychiatric area as the main character struggles with a previous failure that killed many while leading his men into battle again.It might be a good movie in some catagory (although I doubt that), but a war movie...... no."
1,Worst Of All,this is like mr.hanky for the watchersof southpark. But if you aren't watching it; &#304;T &#304;S JUST L&#304;KE WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU S&#304;T ON THE TO&#304;LET. DON'T EVER BUY IT 5443r34e.
4,Looking for a creative filter - This is it!,"My wife and I wanted to try some ""creative"" things with our Canon Rebel XT and saw the Cokin filter system as a great step. Our initial trys with the Speed Filter haven't been great - but we are learning. It truly has given us new aspects to our photographic endeavors!"
1,Water resistant??,"When I wore the watch in the pool the first time it filled up with water and eventually stopped working. Needless to say, I do not reccommend it as it clearly claims that it is supposed to be water resistant."
1,Fruitless exercise,"The author writes two chapters trying to explain the phenomena associated with near death experiences through brain oxygen starvation and the ""dying eyes"". Doing so, he fails to give a convincing explanation to the near death experiences. Read for instance Susan Blacmore's ""Dying to Live""For the rest of the chapters ( the majority of the book ) he searches for an inexistent soul, reaching the conclusion that the brain is the vehicle of the mind, and not the soul...Even so,his demonstration is based upon the functions of the motor cortex, ignoring that it is conscience that gives the movement order. And where is consciousness? You have to look in some other book.Finally, he lets us know wich kinds of deaths there are ( the good, the bad, the so and so ) and how we'll feel death. Thanks man, but I don't like to think about my death. I get depressed.To make things short, this book isn't worth the effort to read it."
3,Nice tribute to Broadway's grande dames...,"Ms. McRae recorded a number of fine albums during her long career, but this 1962 tribute to Broadway's grande dames (Pearl Bailey, Mary Martin, Ethel Merman, etc.) somehow misses the mark.Despite Buddy Bregman's superb arrangements (they're the reason I bought the CD in the first place), these songs don't quite represent Carmen's best work. She made a better mark as a jazz singer (as her later recordings will attest)."
3,CHEAT!!!!!!!,Twice I have been leading in a tournament in this game and it has frozen up on me. I can't see how one can win when it does that.
1,not worth the money,I unpacked it and first thing was it was short a few parts and then it would not go up or do anything .So i sent it back for a full refund
3,"Very Simple, I would've liked something a little more in depth","Good overview of all the muscles, I would have liked a little more information, but a good introduction book."
4,Great accessory for personal trainers.,"This was a great pick up for my daughter who has just completed a course as a personal trainer.This book was recommended to her and not available in Perth.A quick check on Amazon and there it was, a few short weeks later and it was in her eager hands.Although she has just started, my daughter already thinks this is a great reference book."
1,Yuck!,I hate these shoes. They hurt my feet. The velcro is exposed and it snags the other shoe when you cross your feet.These shoes looked terrible after about a week. I am very disappointed. They look and feel cheap.
5,The book is enthralling!,"The book is very good. I learned alot about the clans byreading this book. The glossary is very good. The book even includes a map to pinpoint the worlds mentioned. The BTech universe is brought to new heights with this book. The drama was good, and Romano Liao's death was an interesting twist. All in all, a must read."
2,Outdated,"The information in the book is not bad, however, the book could use some update or a new edition that also updates or clarifies some of the language used in the different sections of the book."
3,"Was not bad on shipping time, but NOT NEW as listed.","I must give credit to the seller for great packaging and timely shipping. Although, the item was specified as being a brand NEW text book. When in fact it had scuff marks and dinges all around the cover and insides, but still in descent condition. The price I feel should have been lower for the item."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This book wasn't to my liking. Like its predecessor, the villians are absurd - even more so than in Homunculus. They are like bad Adam-West-era Batman villians. And the time travel/history altering that goes on makes this hard to follow at points. And sometimes the characters' motivations are kind of difficult to understand (I mean, let your enemy die already!) Explosions, cackling insane villians damaging toy elephants (is that supposed to be symbolic or suggestive of the later animal damaging that goes on?)... this book was weird. Plus... why do the villians in these books always have to do yucky stuff to animals? Ugh.That being said... the end is subtle and wonderful. Blaylock does a wonderful job of throughly crushing his hapless hero, and so his final redemption is completely, and convincingly, sweet."
2,Unsuccessful,"Essentially a pastiche of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, HG wells, and Victorian adventure stories. Written with a breathless style and not enough humor to overcome the cliched characterization. The plot features a slightly confusing effort at use of time travel paradoxes."
4,"Good battle review, difficult to read",Mr. Whiting gives a perfect recollection of the different divsions' struggles in that (otherwise beautiful) part of Germany. I have but two remarks. The first the popular reference to the commanding officers as 'Top Brass'. If you use it too much it just gets annoying! Then there is little graphical support of the text. Small situational drawings would have done miracles here. But considering all its a good book.
5,Sidney Crosby On the Ica and Beyond,"This is an amazing video. If you are not a hockey fane before watching this video, you will be afterwards. This video is well directed and follows Sid through his trials an tibulations on and off the ice. Enjoy!"
5,Love it <3,I loved this dvd but I'm not sure if the autograph on the front cover is actually Sid's or not.
1,"Poorly researched, not interesting, only ""funny"" for a few minutes...","I began reading this book, thinking it would be insightful, humorous, etc. I wasn't expecting a tour de force of Presidential politics, but this was a half-assed attempt. Essentially, it the author takes something that everyone knows about, like Carter being a peanut farmer, and then makes comments like ""peanuts are weird. People don't like peanuts, and that was a problem"". (Not an EXACT quote). It is humorous, but needed to interject some lesser known facts, and more interesting writing..."
3,Pretty long.. a bit goofy.,"If you're looking for a coffee spoon that will fit inside your coffee jar, look elsewhere. This spoon is 10"" long. The description here says 3x3x3.. it's not 3"" anywhere. It is a nice looking, well made, big, goofy, wood spoon."
5,Rainbow scoop,"The coffee scoop was purchased as a gift for my daughter in law. She is super lady andthis little scoop is something I have wanted for myself, but decided she deserved it more.Love, Mom"
3,Not exactly...,"I know this sounds strange but I ordered this spoon for my cat. He was recently diagnosed with diabetes and I was in need of a spoon that would measure exactly 1/8 of a cup. Well, unfortunately this one does not. It's a pretty spoon but I have no use for it. Didn't return it because it was inexpensive but for now it will just sit in the cabinet unused."
4,Good CD!!,"Purchasing this CD sure brought back some memories. When I had borrowed the vinyl version of this Sdtk from a friend many years ago, I had no idea that there was extra minutes of music cut out. With this CD you get to hear that little bit that you didn't here when the original sdtk came out. If you liked the movie, why not go ahead and get the CD?"
5,It's in the Top Ten!!!,I truly love the movie and I have been impatiently waiting for the CD. If you have seen the movie you will know that these songs just add to the essence of the movie. So check it out...Sho'Nuf!!!
1,Rockports with poor fit,I have worn Rockport size 10 1/2 loafers for many years. So I had no qualms about ordering them online. These loafers did not fit and seemed to be at least one size too small. I returned them and went to the store and bought them - size 10 1/2.
3,More of a story than a play...,"You have to be REALLY creative set-wise to put up this production. It takes place in a ton of different locals. It seems much more like a short story with visuals than an actual play. Was an enjoyable read, though. Not quite as good as Bug."
3,Great hose but coils up a bit too easily for my preference.,"This is a very high-quality air hose with good brass fittings but it has a tendency to ""coil"" much more easily than I'd prefer and this makes it something of a pain to use. I'll continue to use it but think that I'll also invest in another hose that's a bit easier to use and store (perhaps I'll permanently install this one in my shop)."
4,"Bright color, OK quality","TheGOODYEAR 46512 3/8-Inch by 10-Feet 250 PSI Lead-In Rubber Air Hose With 1/4-Inch MNPT EndsI bought along with this actually feels to be better quality. There is nothing industrial about the crimps or fittings. I believe 'industrial' refers to the color, rather than the construction.The color of this is a bonus."
4,good product and you won'y have any trouble finding it.,This is a pretty good air hose. It doesn't tangle or kink up and it's easy to see so you won't trip over it. I'd buy another one if I need more length. I keep it on my Makita hot dog compressor and it's perfect for that.
3,"Good quality, can't coil neatly under pressure.",The quality and price seem very good. My only complaint(like others) is that it will not coil neatly when under pressure. When disconnected (or depressurized) it coils fine.
3,Pretty good hose,"I like mine , the color is a bonus.I dont use this type in cold weather as it gets too stiff. In the cold I use rubber.This is why I rated 3 stars ."
3,Second time's the charm,"I have 3 50 ft. yellow rubber Goodyear hoses, but wanted a shorty for my portable compressor. The first time I hooked this up, it blew one of the ends off...turns out the crimp collar to hold the fitting to the hose was never put on one end. Amazin' Amazon replaced it, no problem, but it's still an extra trip to the post office to return it. Anyway, it's a decent inexpensive hose, but a little stiffer than the rubber ones. Fills the bill for portability."
5,Great Deal,I bought two last month and liked them so much I am grabbing annother for my shop. They are more flexible than others I have in the same price range. As far as durability only time will tell.You just can't beat the price especially with the free ship.
3,Not what I was hoping for.,"I have this product at home but was running low so wanted to order more. Apparently, the company doesn't manufacture anymore so I can't buy it online from the Co. or from discount stores. Unfortunatley, this product doesn't have the same consitancy or leave my hair feeling the same way as the one I've been using at home. Oh well, live and learn. I hope some day I can find this product again."
5,Not just a thickener!,"I have a mane of curly hair, & when I combine Rusk's Being Gutsy with Loma Pearatin Nourishing Oil, it's the best hair product ever! Great scent, tames frizz & defines curl. I am searching for one seller who sells both products."
5,One of the best Dragonlance books I have read,"Being a big fan of Elves myself, I never really knew much about the Kagonesti. This book descended upon me in the summer and I could not put it down. Quite possibly the best history I have read. It spans well over three generations, shows everything about the relationship with the Silver Dragons. The only thing that I can find to complain about it is the fact that it spent a bit too much time on battles with other cultures, instead of describing the society itself, which does seem a little one-sided."
4,Well Done,"Niles has completed a huge story in a few pages with this novel. The time covered is amazing in itself, but the great thing about it is that it is like getting three short novels in one book. A very fun read! The only thing I would like to have seen is three books instead of one. The individual ""Pathfinder"" stories were good but a longer more in depth story would have been even better. Still, a great, easy, read."
5,Great!,"Very nice view points in this book. This book is nearly as good as its counterpart, The Dragons. This book is very realistic with its wars at the appropriate times and the tribes of Kagonesti responding to the destruction of their forests and the historical facts as viewed by the Pathfinders of the Kagonesti. A definite must read."
1,Huge disappointment.,"I loved 1 & 2 and when I saw 4 in store, I stached it up at once. Got home. Installed it. Played it for about 40 mins and then uninstalled it.The game play is, as far as I can tell, exactly the same as 1 & 2. A few tweaks here and there but nothing new. The interface and world/map felt chunky and unpolished. I think they tried to add every bell and whistle they could. But all of it just got in way and didn't really affect the game (much).I was really disappointed. Personally I think HoMM2 is still the best."
1,one step forward....five steps backward,"i loved homm2 and homm3 and anxiously awaited homm4. what a huge disappointment. the ai is ridiculously simple in the single player mode....i'm not sure you could lose if you tried. plus they tried to make the battle mode more ""realistic"" and succeeded only in eliminating the strategy aspects. skip this one and hope for the best for homm5 (if there is one)."
1,careful Mac owners !,"This older version of heroes is more fun than the newer 5 version, but it IS NOT COMPATIBLE with newer Mac X snow leopard operating system no matter what vender tries to tell you ! It just won't work period ! Better off using IBM version and partitioning space to load windows. Check with Mac help before purchasing ""Mac versions of anything"" trust no sellers ""word"" ."
1,Heroes IV Won't Run on OSX Lion,"I thoroughly enjoyed Heroes IV on my PC, but am done with PC's. This game will NOT RUN on OSX Lion !!"
4,Game to get hooked on...,"This game isn't a processor hog, and you can easily spend all day playing it... and it is well worth it.."
2,beginners only,"More of a primer for the sport. If you've been to a cyclocross event and paid only relative attention, you already know more than this book is offering. It's getting quite dated with technology, techniques and pictures from too long ago. Another edition is badly due."
2,Basic but informative,Yes it's outdated but it's possibly the only book on Cyclocross out there you can easily find. Definitely written for someone new to the sport. Very basic but still a good resource. The training and technique part of the book are pretty biased so don't use this a a bible for the sport. As a previous review stated it's really a primer.
4,Wally's World,"This particular album is probably not for the pow wow purist. I personally enjoy a little change of pace, and Pipestone delivered. This is my first Pipestone purchase. It has a nice round dance flavor, and they pretty much cover the pow wow circuit 'love life'. My favorite track has to be 'Wally's World'. I thought I was the only one who loved Walmart, but Pipestone digs em too. My favorite line is "" Without you I'd fall apart, thank God for Walmart"". Amen to that Pipestone! Also I really liked 'Strollerz', 'Teepee Creepin'. 'Kiss Goodbye', but really The entire album is fun and light. You can't miss with this one. Aloha. Kawika"
3,A New One in the Six,"The most successful single from the 1984 album, Sex Shooter, only reached #85 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart - the other single, Blue Limousine, failed to chart - but there continues to be interest in this release from fans of Prince and those who collect 1980s memorabilia.The trio includes two members of Vanity 6 - Brenda Bennett and Susan Moonsie - and Patricia ""Apollonia"" Kotero, who took the place of Denise ""Vanity"" Matthews in the (renamed) group and in a major role for the movie, Purple Rain. Sex Shooter was performed in the movie and the album has seven total tracks that clock in at a skimpy 34:05.That a CD version of the album has yet to be released in the United States is surprising, though, since the variety of Prince projects - especially those surrounding Purple Rain - had a major pop culture significance, no matter the total number of units sold at record shops."
4,I love mine,"You know, in reading the other reviews, one has to wonder what it is they were expecting when they bought their Sony MS. It's a gadget, a toy, and it is a prized possession of mine. I found it easy to use, easy to download music, great to carry around and take music on the go without carrying a cumbersome CD player and CD's. Maybe if I was a techno-freak I would have knocks against this product, but for the general consumer I think it's a great toy.Just wish it came with a case or clip so I could more comfortably take it running."
1,this is *not* an MP3 player,"almost too shocked for words - the advertising and packaging clearly mentions MP3. I was very dissapointed to learn that *IT DOES NOT PLAY MP3 FILES*. The player only plays files of the ATRAC format.If you want to use this, be prepared to use the proprietry software and have to re-convert your entire collection."
1,Seriously Lacking in performance and adaptability,"After much research in the area of portable digital audio, I bought the Sony memory stick walkman. Three days later I returned it. First of all, the software is not compatible with my computer (a Dell Inspiron 5000). I could rip songs from one CD and then it refused to recognize the drive. I'm sure it works fine with a Sony computer, just not with mine.Additionally, I thought a memory stick walkman would be a nice addition because my Sony digital camcorder also uses memory sticks. However, you have to buy a magic gate memory stick to use with the walkman, which costs three times more than the already expensive regular memory sticks.For the money, Sony should really do better. I have since purchased the Nomad Jukebox. I have had no problems at all, plus I don't have to worry about losing a collection of memory sticks since I have 6 GB in one solid piece."
1,Has proprietary power supply and data storage,"After having this product for a year, I'm shopping for another MP3 player. I've realized that by this product having proprietary powersupply and storage, we are initially forced to stay loyal to this product at exhorbitant prices (i.e for replacements or accessories and sotrage). It gives me the impression that such companies are insincere towards customer satisfaction in the long run or are not far sighted enough to maintain long term customer relations. My next Mp3 player will have AAA or AA batteries, which I can change anytime without having to replace the entire rechargeable unit after it dies, it will have standard storage as per what market requirements are either MMC/Smartmedia/Compact Flash. If would be ideal if it also has an FM tuner on it. It should be small and light weight and can be clipped to the belt or arm for purposes at the gym."
3,"perhaps a big, huge problem","I heard from numerous sources that once a song has successfully been stored onto the player then deleted that same song can not be re programed onto the player. This may pose a huge problem to many people, it would certainly annoy me."
1,Beware if you have Windows 2000,"So, you buy a Sony product and expect that the company will support it. Well, beware! I have a new computer and can no longer use my MP3 player. Not only was it unbelievably difficult to figure out how to use the software, but I had to reboot my machine every time I wanted to rip a CD. Now I can't even use the product. YIKES!"
1,Trashware,"I bought the music clip version of the sony players. These products are a total waste of money. True, they have a sleek, compact design but are functionally worthless due to the multiple limitations of the software (open MG jukebox) which must be used to download or convert files. As best I can tell they are not really MP3 players but only play reformatted MP3 files. As a result you must clog up your hard drive with all of the converted tracs in addition to the original MP3 files. To make matters worse, you can only check out a song from 1 computer to one music clip player. But wait, it gets worse. You can only check a song out to that specific player 4 times. This is SONYs effort to protect copyrighted music for which it has a vested interest. But the ads are misleading and the product worthless to me. This is SONYs next Betamax. I've gone back to my prior, somewhat chunkier player which is convenient if slightly larger"
1,Expensive and Useless,"Sony has made a nice piece of hardware, but you can only get music onto the thing using their sites when downloading emusic. And, if the song is fairly popular, chances are, you will have to pay to download it. The real surprise is that you do not get to keep the song, you have to check in and out of Sony's mainframe to ""check in"" and ""check out"" the songs, plus, they will erase your song if they decide you have had it too long. Basically, its an MP3 player that is expensive, and you can not even get the music you want. I bought mine, and returned it furious 3 hours later."
1,Defective design.,"I received two sets of the color trend flatware for christmas.At first glance I was pleased. Great colors, nice feel to the metal...I removed them from the box, washed them and threw the box away. Big mistake. THe first piece broke the day after Christmas. 3 months later I have about 4 pieces left of the original 40 pieces. The problem (as a previous poster has mentioned) is that the handles fill with water when washed then the plastic cracks and falls off. Save yourself some $$, this flatware is a complete waste."
2,Good but...,"Not long after I bought these, they started to crack, fill with water, and eventually the plastic parts just started coming off. I don't even have a dishwasher, nor anything that should have caused them damage. I've thrown most of them out, or reserve them for tool use. Too bad."
5,A moving story that makes a lasting impression!,Every time I read this story I choke up. What a tremendous point of view to share a story to children as well as adults. It is an outstanding book to teach children about Christ's crusifiction and the honor felt by these Three Trees!
5,the tale of three trees,"The tale of three trees was a book I received my ninth Christmas. At first I thought the book looked stupid but when I actually sat down and read it I found it to be a very impactful book. The one place, in the book, that impacted me the most was towards the middle of the story when the third tree said ""I want to grow so tall when people stop to look at me they will raise their eyes to heaven and think of God"", this third tree was the tree I connected with the most. What this tree said made me think and impacted my life for the better."
5,Beautifully Done!,"This was very well done. Very subtle, yet...as a very Christian adult, it almost made me cry. The artwork really caught my 3yr old's attention and my 5 and 7 yr olds loved the story (and making the connection between the wish and the finished product). We are giving this as a gift to a non-practicing Christian. It is subtle enough not to offend, but strong enough that it may spark some interest in furthering their Christian Faith."
1,NOWHERE near as good as other versions!,"This version is really bad comparitively. The trees are all the same, and it doesn't tie in the meaning of the book for youngsters as well as the version by Catherine McCafferty. In her book, each tree is a different type showing its own strenghths, and it states clearly that God has fulfilled the dreams of the trees but in much bigger ways than the trees could ever dream. This book just ends the story and doesn't tie it all up for the kids. I recommend the Catherine McCafferty version highly! There ia also a really nice video narrated by Hal Holbrooke based on the Catherine McCafferty version."
5,This is the best book ever.,I have never read a childrens book that gave me goosebumps and brought tears to my eyes. My daughters and I call this our 'special' book. It's a very touching story with wonderful illustrations. I have recommended it to everyone I know-even people who have no children or grandchildren.
5,my aunt thanks you,thank you for your time and product. may the Lord Jesus bless you beyond measure this year and years to come. :)
5,The Tale of Three Trees Review,Contact with seller occured promptly.Received product quickly and in the condition described.Great! No complaints.
3,Wishing for better illustrations,"I was impressed by the story, but the illustrations were not what I had hoped they would be. The feel and look did not match the story or draw in the reader/listener. Illustrations were too dark and not as captivating as I believe they could be. I would love a copy of this story with a different illustrator such as Cheng-Khee Chee or Julie Vivas."
5,Love it!,"Fantastic story and durable board book! Joe let me read it 3-4 times each night for the first week, it is a winner!"
5,When bad things happen--what then? For grown-ups too.,"This wonderful re-told folk tale has a profound wisdom about the inevitable reversals, losses and tragedies of life. The usual chestnuts range from ""God did it to you because you did something bad"" to ""Stuff just happens."" But here is real soul-satisfying depth. The hopes and dreams of the three trees are crushed, but out of the wreckage God's love makes fulfillment. It's grand theology, and a helpful and hopeful message--and not just for children!"
2,Very Disappointed!!!,"I needed to sing a song for my audition in school to the Advanced acting class, and I decided that I wanted to sing Dentist from Little Shop of Horrors. I was so excited because I couldn't find the karaoke version of this song on iTunes, but I found it here with just enough time to get it shipped before I actually had to perform with it in class. When I got the CD, I listened to the CD to learn my song, and it was nothing like the actual broadway version! I started to listen to some of the other songs, and I saw that some of the songs had the wrong words and the arrangements were messed up. The arrangement was so bad on the song I was planning to sing that I had to find a whole new song! I would not recommend buying this CD!"
4,Worth the money,"Was a great book, worked for school was a little more worn then stated but other then that great book and pretty cheap price"
1,Not at all what I had expected,"I paid for a brand new textbook, and what I received was nothing but a very good photocopy. Pages are entirely black and white, and are very obviously photocopied. It makes me wonder exactly how much of the text might be missing. Very unhappy.Amazon shipped a replacement, which then proved to be yet another black and white photocopy of the same book! Do not buy this book here!!!!!"
3,Lot of action,"Not one of the great World War II movies. Lot of action but falls short of being a ""GOOD"" war movie. Mary Murphy saves this poor movie."
2,A Good Cast--But That's All,"The stars of this movie, Tony Curtis, Frank Lovejoy and Mary Murphy have appeared in some good movies. Beachead is not one of them.I think this was a feeble attempt by the screenwriters to create another ""Ambush Bay."" They failed."
2,Set aside 30 min. to get the security stickers off.,Set aside 30 min. to get all the security stickers off.It was very difficult to get the DVD case open.
3,Beachhead review,"War, romance, 2 men fighting over a girl, a young Tony Curtis - what's not to like?"
5,MY FIRST EARL KLUG IMPRESSION,"MY HUSBAND GIFTED IT TO ME BEFORE OUR WEDDING. I HEARD KLUGH MY FIRST TIME. THE MUSIC WAS IN A CASSETTE. UNTIL TODAY I HAVE IT, BUT AS YOU KNOW, CASSETTES MUSIC FADES IN TIME AND SOUND QUALITY. I AM SEARCHING TO FIND A CD! THIS IS A REFRESHING MUSIC, SUITABLE FOR BREAKFASTS AND FOR AMBIENCE. 5-UP! SINCE THEN I HAVE MORE EARL KLUGH'S MUSIC IN HOME. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.!!!!"
4,Jesus ministers in a real sanctuary,"The book of Hebrews tells us that Jesus has entered ""the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands."" Yet most Christians have little concept of a heavenly sanctuary. Goldstein argues persuasively that the sanctuary is a central biblical concept in both the Old and New Testaments. In the OT it taught sinners that the only way to salvation was through blood -- the blood of animals symbolizing the perfect sacrifice that the Messiah would some day provide. In the NT, the sanctuary is most clearly presented in the books of Hebrews and Revelation. In *Between the Lamb and the Lion* Goldstein focuses particularly on the sanctuary scenes in Revelation, demonstrating that, even after His perfect sacrifice on the cross, Christ is still involved in the life of His people through His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. A thought-provoking book for the serious Bible student and well worth more than its price."
4,Great teaching,Very helpful teaching on the Lord Jesus Christ and His work to save us. Great information on the sanctuary as well!
5,Very good,I thought it was very good. Kept my interest. I didn't want to put it down. First book I've read by this Author. I plan to read many more.
2,Turn the other cheek,"I guess I had expected a bit more practical advice than to simply accept the fact that life isn't fair and to let my boss take credit for all of my accomplishments. Funny thing though, I DID feel better after reading the book as it made me realize how incompetent leaders can survive and even thrive despite all their shortcomings."
4,It's so funny...,"It keeps hitting the nail on the head; so much written is so true and on top of you constantly nodding your head in agreement, you'll be laughing out loud; you'll enjoy it--whether you are an idiot or not!"
2,He's right. He's an idiot.,"Okay, this author is right. He is an idiot. I didn't know he would spend the first couple of chapters convincing me that not only is he an idiot, but that I, the reader am probably an idiot as well. I'm sure there are some brilliant tips and suggestions and insights here, but I wish he'd left his ""come to realize"" moments about his own idiotcy on the editing floor. I don't mind a personal approach where authors share their own frailties and insights at pertinent points in a book. But I don't want to be awash in their own self-flagellation. I confess. I became so annoyed half-way through this book I put it down and haven't finished it. I got the sense he was explaining his ""come to Jesus"" moment of insight about his own idiotcy to someone and they said, ""Gee, you ought to write a book about that."" (Probably so they wouldn't have to listen to him talk about it anymore.)Sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,Pretty mediocre,"This book wobbles between weak attempts at humor, brief examples of Idiot Bosses which aren't used to demonstrate any points, and inane advice on how to get along with ""idiot"" bosses. The author doesn't succeed in any of these areas.I'll save you the money: His advice on how to deal with ""idiot"" bosses is to not get upset about their idiocy, which I think is better summed up by the Serenity Prayer:""Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,the courage to change the things I can,and the wisdom to know the difference.""Of course, he doesn't really give any advice on how to actually DO this. I think anyone who is really having problems at work dealing with a difficult boss look at another book, since this one won't help them at all."
5,Great Strainer,"This strainer is handsome, solid, nicely decorated, and a delight to use. The strainer basket isn't centered in the cup, which is a little unusual when compared to the standard tearoom version of this product. That said, the off-center strainer is no harder to pour tea through than a centered one, and the longer handle is easier to use than two short, stubby ones. When seated in the cup, the strainer does not tip over. Overall, this is a very nice product."
3,had to buy more,We got 3 of these and then my mother and my husband's mother both wanted one so we had to go out and get more! They seem to be very popular.
3,"Does the job, a little small","Does its job, but smaller than I imagined. I wanted a strainer for loose leaf herbs, but this is more just for tea where its more concentrated, less bulky. I also have to fill the cup to the very top in order to steep the tea leaves, it doesn't hang down into the cup very far. If I could do it again, I would keep searching off-line for the right strainer."
2,Hunk o' Junk,"What you get is cheaper then what you see! Basically you place the loose tea leaves in this wire mesh and place it over top of a mug while pouring hot water through the strainer. The strainer is not very deep so those of us liking stronger tea will be displeased as the tea leaves can't ""sit"" in the water, or in order to make them do so, the mug must be almost over flowing with water. Also the tap holding this device over the lip of the tub is quite narrow meaning that if you have a thicker mug, it doesn't hold well if at all making this device more cumbersome to use.For a few bucks is it worth it? Probably. But if you are looking for a good/great device, this isn't worth it in my opinion."
2,if you're expecting the dance/r&b sound forget this cd!,"The only reason why i gave it two stars is because you might be the type who likes the rock/pop sound.If so,you may really like his second debut cd.I understand that musicians grow from cd to cd but there needs to be some consistency.Joey should use Prince as an example.Prince grows from cd to cd but his music still sounds like him.I feel that Joey wants to grow but he's throwing consistency out the door.One minute your doing a dance/r&b sort of thing than your doing a rock sort of thing.What's next?I really like 'Stay The Same'.I don't know maybe he's trying to find himself musically.The sad thing is while he's doing that he might lose his fans."
4,Better then the first.. keep evolving!,"I really liked this album. It was much more musically diverse than his first album. You've got everything in here. I'm still looking for him to come up with an album that fully allows ""joemac"" to display his incredible voice without being overshadowed by the music."
5,Biggest compliment I can give...,"I liked Stay The Same. So when I first heard Meet Joe Mac I had to listen without prejudice because I knew this cd would be different, not as 'pop'. My opinion was not as raving when I first listened to it. Now, I have fallen in love with some of the songs and I couldn't imagine my cd collection without it. Joe has shown us on Meet Joe Mac, just how much he has grown up personally and musically. My biggest compliment I can give Joe is this, if I had to make a cd list for that 'deserted island', Meet Joe Mac would be one of my top choices. For me, some of the songs are like little stories you just get lost in. And the best part about Meet Joe Mac, in ten years (with or without that deserted island) I know I will still be listening to every song and singing along. So if you are looking for music you can listen to over and over and can't help but sing along to buy Meet Joe Mac."
4,Joey is changing his style?,"Having read most of the reviews, I have this to say about the comments saying that Joe is trying to ""change"" ...His New Kids days may not have reflected Joe's taste in music as an individual - Jordan Knight's style is totally different from the New Kids. Their albums are individualistic.Meet Joe Mac is an album that showcases Joe's growth as a musician, and if you have a chance to see him on stage, he has also grown as a performer. This album is definitely a secret treasure, and Joe is moving in the right direction."
1,For fans and completists only,"Brother is one of my favorite bands out there right now. Their blend of engaging pop rock hooks, introspective lyrics, tight harmonies and energenic performances mixed with bagpipes and a didjeridoo make them one of the most unique musical offerings out there.This album, commonly referred to as the Black & White album, was their first. Unfortunately, not much of what I mentioned above is present here. The harmonies are good, but the material is substandard. There are a few minor highlights, but overall, Brother comes off as one of those anonymous 80's bad movie soundtrack bands that you hear on cable TV late at night.Hey...every band has to start somewhere. If you're a big fan, go ahead and get this to complete the collection. If you're new to the band, get one of the other albums. Don't start here."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I've owned one of these things for a while now. After about four months both the rings had broken and are now long gone. Some of its crevices are a pain to clean. It has three metal rivets on the surface which are pretty much impossible to clean, and will start to change color with time. It stands on three un-capped metal feet which can scrape or scratch pans. It has served its purpose, but I won't be buying again."
4,Works as designed,I specifically bought this to use in my 4 qt pressure cooker. Works as designed and that works for me. Recommend.
4,"No center post, but a little floppy","The lack of a center post is huge! I can steam a giant globe atrichoke without problems because it doesn't have the center post.The only drawbacks are that the leaves are a bit floppier than in other steamer inserts that I have met, and the rings can be difficult to get a hand on (especially if you didn't think about it when you put the steamer in the pot, and left the ring under the leaves)."
1,What's happened with steamers,It used to be that we'd buy one of these stainless steamer trays that go in a pot and we'd use it for years until it was just too ugly to continue. The last few years we keep buying them from every source we can find and they last a few weeks or months. This one was the worst. The little edge leaves pop off and we try to put them back together and crimp the tab a bit more but they keep falling out. A grand and absurd nuisance. I know China makes just about everything we buy these days but they could make these better if our manufacturers demanded quality. Me and my soap box :-)UPDATE: Amazon does have a very good steamer basket now. It is the Chef Craft 21522 six inch. It answers all of my wishes.
1,waste of money,"wasn't expecting anything fancy due to price but the design quality was nonexistent. the ""petals"" fall off when washing or any kind of handling. almost need oven mitts to remove it from the pan as the the handles arebasically key rings. spend a little bit extra and get something good quality"
1,Worse Ever.,"This is really junk. The first time I used it, 4-5 pieces broke off. Impossible to put them back on, they just kept falling off. Went in the trash..."
4,Does what it needs to.,"Overall, as the title states, it does what it's designed to do, nothing more.I would probably improve upon the overall quality with small things like a handle or loop to pull the steamer out of the pan...or maybe mine just didn't have one to begin with and it should have?It is, however, easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and sits at the right distance from the bottom of the pan without preventing a lid to still sit correctly on the pan.I would buy again."
2,Doesn't last long...,"While it lasts, this is a very good steamer. However, after only about 4 months of less than weekly use, one of the three soldered support posts simply came off in my dishwasher.Were it not for the evident shoddiness of its construction, I would rate this item higher. As it is, I am left with no recourse but to discard it (it's not worth the time and effort to try and return). I can only hope to find a better quality, similar item or buy a more expensive, dedicated steamer."
5,Norpro Large No Post Stainless Steel Vegetable Steamer,"I knew I wanted one of these unique steamer baskets, as soon as I saw a fellow using one with his pressure cooker on youtube.com the other day, and prior to this I had never even seen or heard of one. I immediately, did a search here on amazon.com, found this steamer basket, ordered it, and received my ""Norpro Large No Post Stainless Steel Vegetable Steamer"", today 13 July 2011. I purchased this steamer basket specifically for use inside my Fagor Futuro 4, 6 and 10-Quart Stove Top Pressure Cooker Pans, while pressure cooking certain foods, and for this purpose, the ""Norpro Large No Post Stainless Steel Vegetable Steamer"", meets my needs perfectly."
1,Worse than 1 Star,"Don't waste your time, money and most of all, aggravation on this steamer. The petals fall off pretty much every time we touch it. We basically have to put it together each time in order to use it which is a huge pain. I would return it if the shipping weren't so close to the amount we spent on it... What a headache!"
2,flimsy disappointment,"It's not the rather large size of the steamer that turned out to be the problem. The construction was sub par, the petals? of the rim pieces began to fall off within weeks. Two of them. I could put them back, but: 1. why should I have to and 2. once back they did not stay put. After years of replacing various folding steamers I've given up.I just tossed this one after months of frustration and bought a tall slim Farberware 3 piece pot with a sturdy steamer insert."
3,Decent steamer but not incredibly durable and a little big,"Positives- Because it is big, you can put a lot of veggies in this, more than others. No center post also helps.Negatives- Because it is big, it doesn't fit in all pots.- The metal pieces sometimes fall off, although it is easy to put them back on.Overall, it works. It is what it is and nothing more. I didn't see anything all that much better anywhere else."
4,A Little Too Big -- But Great Quality,"This steamer insert is too large to use in smaller pots, so be sure to measure and make sure your pot is at least 7"" wide on the inside. The feet won't scratch your pot, and removing the cooked vegetables is much easier without the center post common to cheaper steamers. With this one, I can just use a large spoon to scoop out the items, or if I want I can hoist the entire steamer out of the pan by grabbing the rings on the sides, but that's pretty tricky when it's fully of steaming veggies."
3,Slightly larger than expected,The bottom of this steamer has an rim or lip that makes it the tiniest bit too large. I had another brand of steamer for years but it finally broke and I purchased this to replace it. This steamer is the slightest bit too large (becaue of that rim) to fit comfortably in either of the Revere pots I used the old steamer in. I can get it in the larger pot by tipping it but it is tight.
2,Easily Broken,"About 16 months after purchase one of the legs broke off. Now two years later all of the ""leaves"" are falling out. I like the design, but it just is not sturdy."
1,Not Sturdy Enough,"This steamer works ok, but it broke in less than 6 months. A steamer section with one of the loops on it broke off. I can kind of shove it back in, but it's a real nuisance.I have only used this product for its intended use, and it's already broken."
3,Throw Blanket,"I was disappointed by this blanket. The description didn't clue me in that it wasn't a nice, embroidered blanket. It seemed like something I would pick up at K-Mart. I haven't opened the whole thing yet because I didn't want to destroy the packaging for Christmas, but I was definitely expecting something else. The seller of this should do a better close up shot so you could see what it was made out of."
3,Wrong Style,This item is a 'K' Style Fitting not 'M'.3 Stars because Milton Makes the best Fittings out.Use them daily and the only time you have to buy new is when you get a new tool.Good product if it was the right thing.
3,better than the original,"just to answer ""music fan from UK"", um if you're looking for that true colors song, it is on the original Save the last dance soundtrack. I have that one, my sister has this more music from the movie one and I liked hers better :) They're both good now I just need this one."
4,Helping For Uk,I cant rememebr the chick who wanted to know the name of the song in save the last dance. where sarah (julia stiles) is wearing the orange coat on her first day to school. The songs name is You dont really want some - Blaqout. I hope that helpz
3,Average soundtrack,"That Song that everybody is looking for i think is ""Grits-Ohh Ahh' its an awsome rap song that is in the movie but isn't on either soundtrack(which is why they both are just average). I've been a fan of Grits for a long time. They are Awsome! Check 'em out ASAP! I hope i helped you peepz out!"
4,Great music to dance to,"Though not as good as the original sound track, this CD has good music that will make you wanna dance.My personal favorites:- Hate the Playaz- Dance Floor- When It Doesn't Matter"
3,Lao's review,"A Chinese herbal designed for modern English speaking audiences. This book covers the Chinese philosophy of balance and motion, Yin and Yang. It is organized by food group, with the medicinals alphabetized by common English name within each food group section. A very useful book for natural healing and practice."
5,Excellent! Easy reading and informative!,A unique book based upon Chinese Medicine. Informs the reader WHY certain foods are good and bad for YOUR body type. Many good hints about eating.
5,"Great book, fast shipping",Review title pretty much summarizes it. This book has helped me so I gave a copy to my sister in law.
4,"A good hose, just like any gas stastion....","A good, old-fashioned rubber hose. I like this hose on the working end of the line. It behaves better than stiff poly hose."
4,Good Air Hose,As advertised--using as a replacement for a PVC hose that was almost impossible to roll up and hang --- This is so much better
2,It's a hose. Don't expect miracles! But the truth would be nice.,"True, it is not the Goodyear hose pictured. No strain relief ends. Not packaged as shown. Marked Goodyear but which Goodyear, USA or China? I wouldn't expect this hose to stand up to professional use in the field. However, I have it running to a hose reel so I am stuck with it for a long time.It's a rubber hose. It does the job. If I had to do it again, I'd get a plastic hose. Why? The rubber expands under pressure and makes my compressor cycle on and off more. Remember, the hose volume extends the volume of your tank. The more hose, the more volume. However, if you use a cheap rubber hose a portion of your ""tank"" is stretchy.Subtract 4 stars for the deception. Add one back because it does the job."
4,It Works,"Put some couplers on the ends and use it. It doesn't leak as the ends are of a solid construction. Feels strong and unlikely to tear without some serious mistake on my part. The yellow isn't as ugly as one would suspect, but I hate yellow so that is the only reason for 4 out of 5 stars. Its a solid hose. It'd have to have a pressure gauge or something to be any better."
5,What all compressors should come with,"I bought a new compressor that came with the hard PVC hose and it's a pain to use. I bought two of these Goodyear hoses and this is what all compressors should come with. No more struggling with trying to uncoil a hose to use it. Somehow the name Goodyear makes it a ""Good Experience"" when I use my compressor now. Buy one ""or more"" if you are using a PVC hose that came with your compressor. You'll be glad you did!"
4,Good buy,"I purchased this in a group with a box of adapters and connectors. This is a solid hose, good length, and flexible. It is stout enough not to kink but will bend easily around corners."
1,This goodyear hose ~ IS NOT GOODYEAR !,"This goodyear hose ~ IS NOT GOODYEAR !I just got off the phone with a goodyear rep who told me there is a knockoff company if FL.. Somehow they use the name goodyear, but the real goodyear will have a TM (some kind of symbol) between the good and the year..I own this hose.. I called because my new compressor says rubber will not hold up to synthetic compressor lube.. Unless it is over 36 percent nitrile.. I cant seem to find anything about this hose in tghat respect..Guess I will keep trying.. If it were a goodyear hose I would have had my answer.. The real hoses would probably cost a lot more..But,it would have been nice to know what I was buying in the first place.."
5,Must have,"I'm glad I listened to the reviews and bought a nice hose to go with my new compressor. I've used the coiled, vinyl crappy hoses in the past and they are not enjoyable to use to say the least. This hose is high quality, plenty long for anything, and easy to manage. Made my new compressor even more awesome!"
3,Great except...,"Great lines, just had the breaching happen around the female connectors. Worked well for months though! We did order more!"
2,Great hose but get the one with the bend restrictor,"Bought the hose a month ago and although I love how rugged it is and that it lays flat (compared to poly hoses), definitely buy the one with the black bend restrictor. This one started to leak from the connection after about 10 uses."
5,another great product from goodyear,"i have been using these same hoses at work for a year now and they are a GREAT product. they lay flat on the floor after unrolling and they are really easy to roll back up when your done. forget those ""PUR-hose"" products. i've used them before and they don't lay flat on the floor causing a mess of the work site. i bought 2 and saved on shipping. great product!"
4,great hose/great price,"It compares favorably to the $30 red Amflo hose at Home Depot/Lowes (Goodyears may be a bit lighter and thinner). I bought two and cut one to make a 20 ft. and 30 ft., to have three different lengths available (I bought the barbed threaded ends at Lowes)."
5,Excellent hose,"It's hard to get excited about an air hose, but this is an excellent hose at a very good price. Quality is noticably better than the best hoses carried by local home improvement stores, and is priced a few dollars less here at Amazon. Buy two and get free shipping."
5,Great quality for the price,"I keep this in the recovery bag for my Jeep Wrangler, to use with aWARN PowerPlant Winch. Oil, dirt, and grease clean off quickly with a damp rag. It even stays flexible when cold, and doesn't keep it's shape after sitting for awhile like the coiled plastic ones do."
4,Good Hose,"Made in America, Goodyear hose. no issues at all. bought it for light remodeling work. Good hose."
4,FOR THE MONEY,FOR THE PRICE IT IS BETTER THAN THE HOSE SUPPLIED WITH MY COMPRSSOR THAT WAS A COIL TYPE NIGHTMARE WHEN DOING WOODEN FLOORS.
1,Avoid this one,"Our crew used this hose... it didn't even last through the day. A board was dropped on it and Pssssss we had a leak. I thought it may have been an aberation, but after it was fixed and it happened again within 3 hours and another leak is Pssssssing all over the place I would chaulk it up to the hose. For those of you who may want to know..... I am a contractor, my crew averages 15 years of experience and we are running 5 other hoses. Two of those hoses are over 15 years old and have not met with a fate like this one. We went with this one thinking it was rubber and would be like the other two..... sadly it is not the case. It could be a bad batch of hose but I would avoid them at this time."
5,works good,Grate for home or light work. Air fitting end are tapered at bit so your couplers will not thread all the way back. This is nothing new with air tools. Bit of liquid thread tape and your good.
5,Great Hose!,"Love the hose, it is great quality. Its high quality rubber and looks like it will last a long time. I bought this one because a friend of mine has had one from Goodyear for years and says his still works great."
5,Exactly as described,"I bought this over the PVC hoses as I didn't want to deal with a giant slinky. Just got the hose, hooked it up, and it's exactly as described."
2,Beware of the threaded ends on this product,"Before I purchased this item, I read the review of another person who had trouble getting his fittings on the threaded ends, but I decided maybe he just got the one bad hose out of a million, so I went ahead and purchased one. I had the same problem, the threads weren't cut deep enough to allow me to turn the fittings on.I returned my GoodYear hose and bought a Porter Cable hose which was a little more money, but a lot less hassle."
1,No go,"Very disappointed, especially with all the great reviews. I bought two. The hose was fine, but the 1/4 inch ends were the problem for me. On the first one, the threads were slightly off and leaked air. On the second one, the threads were also slightly off, plus the crimp area was leaking. Lost 30 pounds of air overnight. Sent the first one back already and will likely send second one back.I've since gone to local farm supply store and bought two of the red Goodyear 50 foot, 3/8 inch, 1/4 inch ends. Hooked up exact same couplers, zero leaks, zero issues. Sent other one to my Dad with same couplers. He hooked them up, zero leaks, zero issues. Don't forget to use a little plumbers tape before putting couplers on."
1,Mis-threaded fittings,"This is not a quality product. The fittings are mis-threaded, which makes it impossible to put couplers on this hose. Goes back to Amazon."
5,A great read! Inspirational and engaging!,"A friend gave me this book after hearing the authors' speak. I'm not one to read a book on leadership, but this book grabbed me from the start. It's easy to understand and fun to read. I am already using the principles in my daily life. Get this book for yourself and a good friend today. It is knowledge you can use right away. The writing is clear, concise and not full of military jargon-every point made sense!"
5,A straight-forward approach to leadership that is a must-read for young and experienced leaders alike.,"As a career Marine officer, I am impressed by this book's ability to translate the Corps' leadership principles for women in today's world. This book cuts straight to the chase, capturing the essence of leadership as an art. Too many approaches to leadership miss the point (that leadership is about setting a personal example) and try to imbue the concept of leading people and organizations with mysticism or systemic complexity. Morgan and Lynch, however, get it right. They are honest and to-the-point about their own experiences in the Marines and the business world, offering refreshingly candid insight. What you get from reading this book is that ""Eureka"" moment a well-written business map should offer; that while leadership principles might sound simple, living them is the hard part. I'm giving this book to my daughter, and any young leader I ever have the privilege to mentor. Bravo!"
3,Good Basics,"This book is a great starter book on leadership. It hits many points, but doesn't go into depth on the topics (as to how to deal with situations). But I do recommend the book for a first leadership read. They also have handouts for a group read, great for a journal club at work."
5,Must read for women leaders,If you are a woman that works in a male dominated environment then this book is for you. It is an easy read with examples that make you nod your head in agreement. I have passed this book on to many female friends in the fire department.
1,"Below Average...at best, don't bother reading.","I've read many books on leadership for women and I found this book to be near the bottom of these books. There are plenty of better books on leadership out there than this. The leadership skills, traits, and examples were very basic and I was hoping to find some more insight than what as provided. I'm certain that there are some good books relating to military leadership out there from some women, or men, who have been deployed in support of the war on terror and relate them to civilian leadership styles, unfortunately, this is not one of them. Don't waste your money on this book."
5,The best investment for new Muslims,This book is highly rated by both my husband(a born muslim) and myself a muslim revert. It tells you everything you need to know to beging to pray Salaat. I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn to pray salaat.
2,not ideal,"This included a lot of info, but it could have been A LOT clearer. I found it extremely confusing. Muslim prayer is not as complicated as this book makes it seem. It's actually a simple, step by step recitation and posture changes, but this book turns it into a mess of cross references and unnecessary information. Plus, the book is VERY ambiguous on some points. All in all, this is definately not for the novice. Look elsewhere!!!!"
2,"I would not recommend this book, there are better ones out there","If you already know how to pray Salah, then this book makes a lot of sense. You can show it to someone while explaining it to them as an instructor. However, if you know nothing of Salah, then this book will be pretty horrible for you.There's a lot of loose ends, and information that is missing. I would have outlined the issues more detailed, if it wasn't for the fact that we bought and returned the book several months ago. Yes, it was that bad, just wasn't very helpful to have around.Furthermore, what it does cover, it doesn't explain in detail. For example, the book largely follows the Hanbali style of prayer, yet its completely unmentioned. Nor is there any mention of the differences & comparisons between the various other Madhabs."
2,A lot of fluff,"There's about 50 pages worth of material in this 350 page book. You're better off buying a pocket guide. In fact, I have a tiny French phrase book from Oxford that contains more info and fits nicely in my pocket. They must have rushed this book to market pretty quickly. The CD doesn't contain the audio from the last chapter (sloppy), I've discovered misspellings (sloppy), and there are strange blue ink blobs throughout the book (sloppy). The dictionary in the back is the pits. Despite my criticism, it's not a terrible book. The audio CD is clear and helpful. But there are better values out there."
5,Great Learning Tool,I am a freshman at ole miss wanting to learn another language. This book is fast and efficient and really facilitates your learning. I can easily greet others with confidence. This book is a definite buy.
1,Won't work for beginners,CD only cover very limited scope of the book- how will it work?The title doesn't match the product at all.
3,Best Used For Review,"""French For Dummies"" is a good book for reviewing your basic French but I would not rely on it to learn the language. It does provide many good tips on what preposition to use for certain kind of phrases. It also features the Berlitz style of pronunciation guide instead of the International Phonetic Alphabet so it may be worth buying for that reason if you find the IPA confusing."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I wish I had read the reviews of this book before I bought it. I agree, this book is no different than any other French language text book. It masquerades under the guise of the ""Dummies"" genre but it's just another boring language book. Nothing special about it."
1,This book is dumber than me.,"The ""Dummies"" series has garnered a reputation for the go to place where all things complex can be easily understood. Wrong. The complexities of the French language cannot be translated into this series of books. The layout and progression of the chapters and lessons is lacking cohesion and not very helpful at all. The cd that comes with the book is of minimal help, whether used alone or in conjunction with the text. Save your money and buy Rosetta Stone."
1,..disappointed,"The book came with a broken CD. I emailed the company to send me a new one, but never received a reply. I am very disappointed."
2,A blank page & a missing track on the CD,"I purchase this book 3 days ago in North Sydney, & I realise that page 247 is blank, unlike other blank pages, this page has no indecation that it is purposely blank with a page number.I went to Dymocks Bookstores at North Ryde to verify if the copy I had purchased was a fault, not so, in fact they had 2 copies to prove that it was a fault during print.I would like to know if this fault is found in other cities and countries.Another issue is the audio CD icon on page 279, either the dialogue roleplay is not on the CD, or the track was missing on the CD.I have not yet gone over the material as yet, but in less then 3 days, I was able to notice these general errors, and I have some troubles going to dummies.com to look for the missing - page 247."
2,French for dummies,This product arrived with the CD broken in half. This made it very difficult and I never ended up learning french.
5,"An intriguing, richly rewarding ""read""","From the very beginning, the author grabs you and hurtles you into a complex plot rich in historical detail and filled with fascinating characters. The reader can feel and ""see"" every scene, and the ""otherworldly"" elements of the story are handled with complete believability. You want more when you've finished this novel. I hope the author has more to say, so that readers can delve into the intricate multi-generational aspects of the story in succeeding novels. Unique and compelling. You've got to read this book!!"
1,Doesn't Charge iPhone 3Gs,"This device will cause your iPhone 3Gs to display an error message, and it won't charge. Seems to work OK with other iPods and even the iPhone 3G however. One star for a flawed description of the product."
3,ipod shuffle charger??,"I was looking for a charger for my ipod shuffle because I was tired of using my computer to charge it. I bought this charger because of the good reviews and the description says it pugs directly into the ipod shuffle. It does not. It still requires the awkward usb connector that apple made for it. I'm really not pleased with that feature because the charger for ipod shuffle has a prong that sits up on it, making it less than ideal for travel. Guess I'll have to take the inaccurate product description up with Amazon. Other than that, it's a nice charger, I do like the fact that the prongs for the electrical outlet fold down for easy storage."
5,"Inspiring, thought-provoking story of rehabilitation","This is a must-read! This book opened my life to innumerable possibilities -- and I consider it absolutely essential reading for any prison inmate, about-to-be-released or not."
3,Almost too much,"Bill Sands had a strange life yet almost too many extra-ordinary jobs to make it realistic. It is a good book, I could hardly put it down, yet it had times where I wanted to."
3,Interesting,"This is an interesting read, and certainly stands out amongst recent attempts to get clear about Heidegger's religious proclivities (or lack thereof). The author judiciously treats some of the most important parts of Heidegger's work, and does much to illuminate Heidegger's position on matters theological.While the book has a clear thesis - one looses touch with it during the course of the discussion. In the end, it seems like this is really a book about the author, Marion, and Derrida, rather than a piece of Heidegger scholarship."
5,Tiny Tea Set Will Help Make Timeless Memories!,"I purchased this beautiful little ""Netti Confetti"" Tea Set;'Bunnies By the Bay,' from the seller, mylittlebebe, through Amazon.Com about a month ago. Every step of this purchase ran smoothly. The tea set arrived in perfect condition only a few days after I ordered it. In fact, I consider the set to be in ""Better Than Advertised"" condition. This little tea set is a thousand great photographs waiting to be taken. I can already see Grandma's first baby granddaughter playing hostess to countless ""Tea For Two"" parties with this adorable little ""memory maker"" over the coming years."
3,Good Plot -Interesting,"The main character in Probable Cause is James Dewitt, a former forensic scientist who has become Carmel, California's sole detective, after his wife is murdered in a bizarre courthouse incident. A few month's into his tenture as a detective in a town renowned for its scenery, peacefulness and lack of violent crime, 2 dead bodies appear within days of each other... apparently unrelated suicides. Dewitt's forensic background and disciplined observation reject the easy way to close the cases. When a third body appears, the complexities skyrocket.An excellent story. Dewitt is somewhat remote but grows on you as the story unfolds. The other characters, from likeable to extremely disagreeable or grotesque, are believable. As much as the book held my interest throughout, I feel there is a lack of balance between subplots and the main plot, with the latter suffering. That said, it is well worth reading."
4,Police procedural,"Former Forensic Investigator, James Dewitt is thrown into the world of police investigation after his wife is killed and youngest daughter critically injured by a defendant in a court trial. The Police Chief offers the job of Detective Sergeant to Dewitt and he begins his police career with an apparent copycat killer, who kills but makes it look like suicide by asphyxiation.James teams up with the new Forensic Investigator, Clare O'Leary, who also happens to be an attractive woman. Things get really interesting when James' rival, former detective Howard Lumbrowski turns up as one of the victims.James gains intimate knowledge of the perp's modus operendi when he becomes entrapped himself. The world of justice has many loops and handholds for defendants to use, even the most obviously guilty. Handling of evidence and proper procedure are emphasized and magnified."
1,Ugh!!,"I didn't find this book to be up to his usual standard. Perhaps the extremely distasteful description of the animal killings (in particular, the cat) were abhorrent and I thought, did not add to the content in the least. There had to be a better way to give some insight into the mind of the killer!!"
2,Not as expected,"I bought this video for my son who is going to East Africa next summer. I was disappointed to see that it was like a home video, amateurishly done. Though the scenery was pretty, the animals shown were mainly just standing around. It was fun to see the kids, but, as I said, I expected more."
1,Would like to return for a refund!!,Do not waste your time or money. This DVD is short and gives little information. I have seen better vacation DVDs.
4,a hit!,"I have just recieved this book from amazon and placed it above my baby while he was sitting on his seat, my baby is 3 months old and immediately he was intrigued by the image i showed him. He kept staring at it and you could see excitement in his eyes, i think that was enough to tell me that his first book was a hit! Glad I bought it. My only disppointment though is that i expected the book to be bigger that is why i gave it 4 stars."
5,I have this,"I have Borderline Personality Disorder and this workbook has been helping me to learn, understand, and work through a lot of the issues it has been causing me. I am a healthier person (emotionally, mentally, and physically) for having gotten it. For anyone with BPD this is a must-have. We purchased the other book ""text book"" or ""novel"" however you want to say it on our iPads either through kindle or through iTunes I can't remember, but this you physically have to have in order for it to work!"
5,Finding What Works,"Knowing how to access a place inside to relieve symptoms of long standing illness is pure genius, and this book is the road map to spiritual identification and release of problems, just by learning how to relax and let the spirit do it's job. I love it."
1,not for the BPD sufferer,"This book is more a teaching tool for therapists. I find the information to be too simplified for a deeply rooted disease like BPD. Sure face your fears, but suggesting ""go to the store and buy an item worth less than 50 cents with a 5 dollar bill"". What does that cure? We are not children. Treat us like adults. Im keeping the book only to show friends what sort of a joke these treatments are."
2,Very hard to follow,unless you are taking a class this is very very hard to understand. It is far to advanced for the average person.
5,Another client's perspective,"Diagnosed as having bipolar disorder type 2 and having been exposed to Ms. Linehan's work as a patient in DBT, I found this workbook to be remarkably effective and an invaluable resource in helping me get a handle on my own symptomatology. It is sensitive, pragmatic, understandable and most importantly, LEARNABLE! The tools and excercises WORK, and have enabled me to gain something I've been missing all these years...hope!"
5,GREAT,Loved this manual. The handouts are great and if you are doing DBT this is a must for new practitioners.
5,Training Needed,"The skills manual is great, provided you receive appropriate training in DBT. DBT is an intensive treatment model. Without proper training, the manual is useless. Buyers should order with accompanying text: Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder (Linehan)"
4,Great help,"This book is an amazing alternative to some of the lengthly classes offered by hospitals, though I do not advise against any kind of medical treatment! Many DBT skills groups use this book as their basis, and it's convienent to have at home to use and keep as your own. It's a tough read, but worth all the work. Good Luck. Jenn"
5,A Must for Professionals & Lay Persons Alike,"As a consumer of healthcare services, this publication was enormously helpful not only in answering questions about the origins of Borderline Personality Disorder but also about the best and only way to effectively treat this disorder. From the homework assignments, to the handouts, and especially to the Distress Tolerance Techniques, this book delivers. I highly recommend it to anyone who desires practical ways of coping and of relating to professionals trying to help the patient cope."
1,not a useful book,"I was asked to get this book by my therapist for use in my therapy. I think that this book does more harm then good. While the homework sheets could perhaps be useful, the overall book is written for the therapist. While most training manuals need to be written dispassionately and for general use. This book, frankly, lacks humanity. It generalizes about people with BPD to the extreme, allowing for no middle ground. I also find the large title to be violating of my privacy."
5,great listining,I'm new to books on CD's. but this is great to listin to in car while working or at home
2,ok,it presses okay but doesn't press completely flat the way you have to make the tortillas. good for starting and making them round you just still have to thin them out
4,just what I wanted,Have used it twice and the second time I added 1/2 teas. of guar gum to the mix---no more cracking.
2,Wimpy material - don't buy this,"Aluminium is not the right material for this press, it is not stiff enough. The top bends when it's pushed down over dough, this results in unevenly pressed tortillas. The middles are thicker than the edges. The cast iron press might be better. Not sure. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$."
1,does not work,This unit simply does not do the job. Press makes irregular shaped tortillas and they CANNOT be easily removed from the wax paper. Better job can be done with 2 dinner plates. Save your money.
1,Total waste of money,I bought this to make Indian rotis but cooking with this is time consuming and total disaster. The rotis turn out too small and also the thickness is uneven. The cleanup job after making the rotis is time consuming. I resumed to my traditional method of making rotis.
1,Plzzz dont buy this!!!,Hand rolling is the best guys...dont even think this is easy..Iam returning this product soon. Dint work even once!!!!
4,great tortillas,"This is an easy to use tortilla press. It makes great tortillas if you follow the directions. When you put the masa in the press place it closer to the hinge than the middle, and it will be round and the thickness depends on how hard you press down. It works great, and I think it will last."
4,"Small, handy and useful","The Norpro Cast Aluminum Tortilla Press is smaller than I expected, but still found it really useful. The best thing is it is light weight, easy to use and store. It makes beautiful, round tortillas. You need not have to give it too much pressure unless you need a really thin sheet of dough, otherwise a little press would do the trick. Over all I liked it. Infact it worked better than my expectations... these days I make a lot of whole grain wheat tortillas... with this little helper in my kitchen."
2,"overall, not worth it","The tortilla thickness comes out too thick and uneven, and the size is very small. What I've ended up doing is just starting with the press, then finishing with a rolling pin. It's not worth the price using this press just as a starter. Now I wish I had forked out the extra money to buy a larger square mesquite press."
4,Tortilla pressing skills,Practice is what it takes. Once you get the hang of it the tortillas taste so good.I used heavy wax paper to line both sides of the press. Then sprayed a little pan oil spray on both side and inserted a rolled ball of corn dough. Learning how hard to press how much dough and the right mix of dough and water is the tricky part. It was really worth the trouble since the tortillas taste so fresh.
3,"Works well for corn, not so well for flour.","I love fresh homemade tortillas, so I decided to buy this to save some time. I read some other reviews saying that there is too large of a gap at one end, but I bought it anyways. They were right though. The hinged end has a 0.5 mm or so gap, where the handle end will press until the top and bottom plates touch. What this means is you can only thin your tortillas so much before there is a noticeable taper. I like my corn tortillas about this thick, so I still get some use out of it. Flour however, still needs to be rolled out the old fashion way. All that being said, the devise is well made and is easy to use."
4,Nice little press,"It is a cute, sturdy press. It is smaller than I thought, although I realize the measurements are listed. It will only make the very small taco size tortilla. Also you have to use a bag or plastic wrap as the dough sticks to the press, but seems like that is true of any press."
2,Extremely Light,"Tried to make tortillas but barely had any effect on the size of the dough. Maybe it's for ""light weight"" flour or something more easy to mold than the average flour we used. Not sure. Would recommend purchasing the heavier presses that are a little more expensive but probably better."
4,Beats hand rolling!,"This tortilla press is very easy to use (in fact it's almost fool proof). I lined both sides with wax paper so the pitas and tortillas would be easy to remove. Usually 1-1.5 oz of dough make the proper thickness and you will also want to make sure you place the ball slightly towards the hinge. The one downside to this press was that the side closest to the handle tended to be thinner. I combat this by pressing once, turning the pita the other way in the press (so the thinner end is next to the hinge), and pressing one more time. Despite being thinner near the hinge, my tortillas and pitas are MUCH more uniform using this press than rolling them by hand and it only took me about 25% of the time! I would recommend this press to anyone that makes tortillas, pitas, or flatbread at home. It has really streamlined my bread making process!"
1,POS,"Do not waste your money on this press. It's actually less hassle to roll out the dough and cut the tortillas yourself than to use this press.I was very, very disappointed."
4,Tortilla Maker - smaller than expected,Bit smaller than expected (who reads all the specs....) works and right price so it was a good deal.
4,Good tortilla press,I received this tortilla press as a gift. It is very easy to use. I didn't have the problems with it moving around like some of the reviews. I did notice that it didn't get the flatness 100% even but this was easily solved by rotating the tortilla 90 and pressing again. You have to use wax paper or plastic between the tortilla and the tortilla press but from what I saw online that seems to be the case regardless of the material the press is made. The corn tortillas here in the supermarket taste odd to me as there are pretty sweet so it is nice to have homemade ones without all the work of hand rolling them.
4,Very good,"Anything to do with eating is hard to resist. If you like home made tortillas then a prerss is really a must. I love home made tortillas. In the past I use to flatten the dough by pressing a plate down until the desired thickness was achieved. Now, ZAP, in the press, press down, remove and then on to the next."
5,I love this product!!,"I have had one of these for many many years and it finally died on me. I purchased another of the same to replace it, that's how much I loved it!! I highly recommend these to anyone who wants to make their own tortillas. It sure is easier than rolling them!!"
5,small tortilla press,This product worked perfectly. It is easy to clean. Save the heavy plastic that comes in-between the plates. Put your dough between the plastic and press. Peels off easily.
4,Small,"Works very well, but in the end you get small tortillas that aren't very functional for a meal. I ended up getting a larger press."
3,"Works great for corn, not for flour tortillas.","Am ambivalent about this product. Corn tortillas mash evenly, but with flour tortillas, the sides of the press flex upward. The flour tortilla requires a rolling pin to get the round, consistently flat tortilla shape. Would have rated it a 2.5 since it is in between good and bad. Am looking for a solid steel press."
1,Beyond compare,"Don't buy this product! I'm sure this product works in theory, but in practice, it's just plain bad. The surface area is way too small, the handle is rickety, and it fails to produce a consistent thickness (tortillas become prone to punctures)."
5,Perfect for Empanadas and Arepas... and Green Plantains,"It is beautiful and made very sturdy. Not sure how relevant my review is, cause I'm using this for something different from what's intended for. I always use a plastic on both sides of the press. I use it to press the dough for Colombian Empanadas, it can press the dough very thin, You can use it for arepas rellenas too, I make two discs, put filling in one of them and use the other disc on top and then with my fingers seal the edges. I also use it for Green plantains, after frying small pieces, make sure is cooked through, let them cool off a bit, and then press them as thin as you want, I like them very thin, and then fry them, so nice and crunchy. Again make sure you use a plastic in between. One thing somebody else mentioned it does press the Dough slightly thinner by the end where the hinges are, but for me it's not a big deal, if you need it to be even just turn the dough and press it once more. Sooo Happy!!!"
2,doesn't flatten evenly,"the product flatten thin on one side and thickly on the other, not cool; I had a better one that mysteriously disappeared after my mom visited I will look for that one online again."
4,Tortilla Press,"Works Great! Presses out 6 inch Tortillas. Soo easy to make Homemade Tortillas and it really doesn't take that long. Only three ingredients needed: Masa, water & salt. And they taste awesome!Norpro Cast Aluminum Tortilla Press"
4,So,"As a product, it looks great. Came a few days later than anticipated, but it wasn't urgent, so not really an issue for me. I was expecting the tortillas / rotis to come out a little bigger. However, it does come out evenly, so I'm reasonably assured of evenly cooking it. Sticking a piece of parchment paper in between makes cleanup a cinch. And if it's not perfect, that's ok because I didn't spend a whole lot on it."
5,Does the Job!,"I was a little apprehensive about this press' ability to make tortillas (without breaking at the hinge from the pressure); well, I made 38 tortillas so far, and it's held up well!"
2,Not as pictured,"this item was not as pictured, the jacket i recieved gathered at the waist like the sleeves.......I would not have ordered it if I knew....."
2,"Cheap, but not blue color and tight in sleeves","Beware--as of the date of this post the graphic shows a blue color, but everybody is getting the common to find Beige (""taupe"") color. Also the sleeves are tight--they have a very tight elastic band that makes slipping the jacket past your wristwatch difficult.You get what you pay for--not bad for $12 but beware."
3,Can't Beat the Price but...,"Nice looking jacket at a great price. Sizing runs slightly large in the chest but the sleeves seem tight. I have to loosen the sleeves before removing my wrist watch. Styling is conservative, but attractive. Jacket is NOT a truly lightweight summer jacket, nor is it a winter weight jacket. It has two outside zipper pockets as well as two ""hand warmer"" pockets. Also has an inside zippered chest pocket (read further) and a cell phone pocket. All of these features are convenient. Living in the San Francisco Bay Area, it is a perfect ""all-year round' type of jacket. Although the material and style are good, I gave it 3 stars because of the sleeves and because the inside chest pocket zipper broke after wearing the jacket only two times. I'm sure Amazon would replace it, but the hassle of the return on a $12 item didn't seem worth it. For the price, I am not disappointed."
5,Pretty tough,"I use this for metal working in a small shop and it hasn't melted yet even after grinding down hot welds. American made which probably explains why it works so well. Even after hitting the edges (its all plastic) into metal the disc hasn't cracked or even worn noticeably. Quite a bit more durable than a rubber backing pad, at least so far."
3,Does not fit to your average 41/2 grinder,"I bought this to utilize the 41/2 grinder for sanding and polishing applications.Due to the nut/washer design, it does not fit your average 41/2 grinder.That being said, I havent tried on Milwaukee 41/2 grinder, other reviewers seems to be happy.Also checked (only the reviews) on the DEWALT DW4945 4-1/2-Inch Rubber Backing Pad with Locking Nutand seems like a common issue with these adapters due to the nut/washer design."
5,A Dangerous Executive Power,This little book will show you the way our Constitution has been disregarded by occupants of the Oval Office. Read it and share it.
1,It's unbelievable. I have to answer ...,"I don't need to dream with any scheme to bleed USA. These kind of positions. You WASPs have nothing in your heads... it's impossible to be crazyer than you... You think that the whole world is the same thing, you have no vision beyond your little farms..."
2,A Good Main is Hard to Find,Not the book I was looking for - but for someone writing a research paper on this particular short story; it would be more helpful.
5,Excellent Tool for Life changing results,"Being a person who thinks I have to control everything, I found this book a huge relief of that pressure. The concepts in the book are simple, easy to use and fun. I've told lots of friends about this book and they continue to thank me as they are finding this concept life changing like I am."
2,Hiring the heavens,"I read a lot of these types of books: books through Hay House, Wayne Dyer, etc. This one did nothing for me. I've heard interviews with Jean Slatter saying, ""I didn't know if I had enough information to write a book."" Well, she didn't. It's not a how to, it's not what you need to do more of, it simply states, ""Imagine hiring a real estate person to find a perfect house. Tomorrow you will have that perfect house."" Things like that. As I say, it didn't work for me, but it might be helpful to some. Positive thinking does work, I just didn't find this book useful."
5,Wonderful informative book,"This is a great book, full of good spiritual information that can help with any life.I would recommend it to anyone!Thank you."
3,Not What I Expected,"I was sooooo excited to receive this book after hearing the author on a radio show. She sounded like a hoot! No stranger to angels, asking them for help and other spiritual concepts, I felt this would be something new and different.The book is small but of awkward sizing so it's not really for putting in your purse or taking it to go. The cover is a bit of a yawn too and completely foretells what's inside. :( It's said not to judge a bThe writing is basic and choppy, thus to me, unappealing. No humor is present which I found off considering her interview. I put the book down and tried a few days later. Same reaction.The concept is pretty cool but there could be some embellishments, some sizzle. I totally believe they can work though. I'll just take what I got from the program in which she was a guest and use those items."
5,Angel Express Card - free and included in book!,If you believe in guardian angels then this book is for you. Simple and fun - you will have a field day. I got this as a present and instantly created my career committee ... within two weeks I got the job in the field I really wanted! Try this tool and see where it leads you!
5,Hiring the Heavens,"Awesome book. Never heard of this book until I heard the author on the IyanlaVanZant show. Also very inspiring and gives one an avenue, never thought of before."
5,Godsend book!,"This book is a great book for anyone who wants to utilize the realm of angels. Yes, you can hire a team of angels to assist in day to day life. They will help pave the road for us. Unfortunately, many people are not aware of how the universe is here to help us. We have been blindfolded and ancient wisdom withheld to keep us ignorant and controlled. Angels are here to help us on this earthly plane.This book is a must have!"
5,A Little Book That Changed My Life,"I Love this book. It is not overly long, but easy to read and covers all the necessary points. It is inspiring and helpful on so many levels. It reinforced my beliefs and gave me a usable blueprint for bringing joy and fulfillment into my life.Now I want to buy it for all of my friends and loved ones!"
3,"Good for the price, but not heavyweight","I have several units of these black 72inch 5-tier shelves which I purchased a few years ago and I recently bought two new unit to expand my storage capacity. The new units (#21856) are stamped with the same logo (Sensible Storage) as my old units, but they differ quite a bit in the construction of the shelves (the posts look the same). The shelves are constructed with narrower gauge steel and they give quite a bit when I step on them, unlike my old units. In retrospect, I noticed that these shelves claim to hold 350lb per shelf whereas my old unit was rated for 800lbs. I thought I would point this out to anyone expecting a heavy-duty unit. These shelves are fine for less demaning loads."
3,did the job,this piece of equipment did the job. the only concern was that the mounting holes were micro size.Some small self threading screws would've help out a lot but I managed. other than that it works great and did the job.
2,cheap,"its plastic, so what ever you mount in it wont be grounded by the casethe holes for screws are not threaded, and required a lot of force to get the fine threaded pc screws started, and will strip threads easily, i had to get my electric screwdriver to get the screws to catchthe black color is kind of shiny, so doesn't match a matte black case"
1,AWFUL,"The seller themselves were prompt with shipment and great with packaging, but this product was not worth the care the took. We couldn't use the product at all. The holes were not properly drilled to allow any screw keep the product in place in the computer. The plastic is beyond cheap. We have gone back and ordered a proper aluminum bracket and hope to have better luck. Please beware when purchasing this item!"
4,Star Tech Floppy Mounting Bracket,This bracket is just what I needed. It fit perfectly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that there was not a color choice. Sometimes you just want things other than black.
3,Bogus Description,"The bracket does what I want it to do, which is to hold a floppy in a 5 1/2"" drive opening. Mine is hidden behind another cover so no big deal but the bracket is NOT metal. It is plastic."
3,Works for 3.5 inch drives but not much else,"I purchased two of these to hold OK306 and OK307 disk interface panels from [...]. These adapters have only 3 holes per side for mounting a 3.5 inch drive. The holes work perfectly for a 3.5 inch diskette drive but not much else. Most modern cases that I have used have slots or a lot of holes on each side. Many 3.5 inch panels or other non-diskette-drive options use these non-standard hole patterns. The OK306 and OK307 use non-standard hole patterns. As a result, these adapters were completely useless for the 3.5 inch panels I purchased to use in them but they would work perfectly for a 3.5 inch diskette drive.So, if you want these to put a 3.5 inch diskette drive in a 5.25 inch slot, you're in luck. If you need the adapters for anything else, you better compare the hole pattern on the panel to the hole pattern on a standard 3.5 inch diskette drive before ordering."
2,Plastic is too flexible for some cases.,"It probably works well IF you can use four screws to mount it tightly. Some cases, like the Antec P280, use clips instead, which wil not engage the unit securely. A metal-framed adapter would probably be stiff enough for the clips to do their job.I'm using this for mounting a card reader because the 5.25"" native card readers tend to be few in number, more expensive, and often bloated with ports I won't use."
3,Good Product,"Nice design, love that it is plastic but little difficult to place screws on whatever goes in the tray, whether Memory reader or floppy."
3,Der Kommisar & Not Much Else,"ATF was a compilation album released in the US to capitalize on the major success of the band's cover of Falco's ""Der Kommisar"". The song is a first-rate 80's classic with its chopping guitar riff and undeniably catchy chorus. The song peaked at number 5 on the charts in 1983 and was followed by ""Dancing In The Shadows"" which is a complete 180 in terms of sound. Where ""Der Kommisar"" is dark and moody, ""Dancing In The Shadows"" has a reggae vibe and is bright and sunny with a happy sax blowing throughout. The band slipped away into obscurity after the song dented the bottom of the charts peaking at number 85."
3,"some good, some bad.","In 1983 Falco had the original hit of Der Kommissar, then this english band got a hold of it and turned it into a top 5 smash. I loved their version best. The album ""ATF"" #25, was o.k., they had some other good tunes in, ""Frozen Rivers"", ""Dancing In The Shadows"" #88, and another favorite of mine ""Starflight"". I really can't stand some of the 80's sound, some of this stuff hasn't aged well at all. Still a good listen every few years."
5,One Of Her Best,This is a great album where every song is terrific. Wish some of the songs were longer but that's only because they are so good. Highly recommended!
1,GOING DOWNHILL,"I really liked Justine when it first came out, but the articles and the way the magazine looks have majorly gone downhill in the past year. It looks like a magazine for 8 year olds now and the articles are pointless. Don't waste your money. Any magazine is better than this one."
4,"A wholesome, refreshing magazine for teens!","I've always loved New Moon, but sometimes I want something with more makeup/hair tips, clothes, and celebs. Justine is just that -- but with much more. In the latest issue (Holiday 2004 -- sadly, this terrific magazine features surfer Bethany Hamilton, a guide to skiing, a story from a reader, as well as a story about a teen broadcaster! Stories are interesting, inspiring, and trendy at the same time. Gift subscriptions should be a hit with your teen girls!The only real flaw I've found in this magazine is the lack of honesty. True, everything is non-offensive and ""safe"" but it would be nice if they addressed world issues, such as politics. It's still a great mag!"
5,Pretty good!,"i thought this magazine was pretty good. it has affordable fashion and interesting topics, and is not trashy like some other teen magazines. i did think, however the cover price ($5.00) was a little expensive."
2,"Subscribe Only If You Want To Receive Leftover, Unsold Copies!","Customer service is non-existent. We sent THREE messages with the same problem: at the time of this review, we are into the second week of December. Our first issue was supposed to be December 2012. At home, the latest issues of all our other subscriptions are dated January 2013. We see on the Justine website the Justine December 2012 issue already out on the newsstands and has been since the first of December. We have not yet received it. Aren't subscribers supposed to get their issues before it hits the newsstands? In order to get the latest issue, we finally decided to just cancel our subscription and buy directly from the news stands. Honestly, the liberal lean of this magazine is also just a little worrying. The recommended books are geared more for older teens and young adults, rather than middle-schoolers drawn towards it by the feature on celebrities."
5,Best New Age Album Ever!!!,"This is one of my favorite albums ever. Deuter's ability to create three dimensional space through sound is showcased in this album like nowhere else. Every track is wonderful, but my favorite is ""Lovesong from the Mountain."" I would say this is Deuter's best album, because each track flows seamlessly into the next, creating an overall soundscape of unparalleled beauty."
5,Soothing,This is a nice cd to fall asleep with. It's relaxing and seems to improve my outlook making me more optomistic. Very nice. I highly recommend it to anyone who is stressed and feeling as though they have no control over life issues. You will start to feel better after the first time you listen to this cd.
5,Relaxation Perfection,"I had heard a cut from this album on ITunes and thought that the music was very beautiful, but I was in for a pleasant surprise when the whole album turned out to be wonderful."
5,It does what it says on the cover,"I listened to this CD before purchasing it for my wife, I found it quite relaxing, btw the wife loved it as well."
4,Koyasan; Reiki Sound Healing,This is an excellent cd for any relaxation time; whether it be with a client or not. Even the inside jacket has interesting information making it an added educational feature.
4,relaxation,"I bought this because I loved Deuter's ""Land of Enchantment"" so much. It's not as nice but still very enjoyable and very relaxing to listen to."
5,This CD is so relaxing & beuatiful ...,"If your looking for a calm relazing CD this is it, i love this CD i listen to it all the time perfect for getting to that zen place in this hecktic world."
4,Brilliant Brilliant... some of my all time favourite tracks,"I discovered brother by chance and since finding ""Exit.."" have become and instant convert. The blending of the different styles works magically, and these mixed with the tight harmonies makes this collection a pleasure to listen to and enjoy in its entirety. The music of brother will live in music lovers libraries for a long time to come."
1,Watch ruining your knife!,"If you're looking for an excuse to buy a new knife, this tomato holder will ruin your old knife quicker than taking a hammer to it. Even with small tomatoes, I was unable to slice one without scraping the cutting edge of the knife on the metal sides of the prongs. The picture also makes it look like the bottom would help steady the tomato while you cut it, but it's actually very round and makes it harder to control. I'd suggest skipping this ""utensil"" and buying that new knife without apology."
1,Terrible,"This was just about the cheapest yet worst gadget I have ever invested in. My knives do not fit through the last 2 slicing lines, so the gadget only provides me with a 1/2 cut tomato. Furthermore, this gadget tears up knives faster than you could imagine."
1,Didn't work well,"Hello! As the other reviewers, this didn't cut well and I did ruin a good knife so I put it into the dishewasher...not good the finish came off and even on my hands...so this stuff is getting off on my food?...I tossed it right in the wastebasket! Don't waste ya money!"
1,total and complete garbage,"Who is the wunerkind who invented this piece of crap? It doesn't work, trashed every knife I tried to use with it, is unwieldy, and currently resides in a landfill polluting the earth. I got it as a gag gift. Perfect. It made me gag. I couldn't even pass it on (I think I was the tenth person to get it), which is why I just threw it away."
4,Nice Product,CCM delivered a Body Glove product in Fellowes packaging. The case is a tight squeeze for my palm treo 755p - the phone does not come out of the case smoothly or quickly. The case is well constructed with a non-scuff interior. The dual magnets hold the flap closed very securely. The clip accommodates a belt up to 1.5 inches wide (3.5cm).I purchased three different cases and will probably use this one and send the others back because this one actually stays on my belt. The others slip off because their clip is not big enough.This is the same product as ASIN: B000N7DA7U
3,Not all that...,"I've had the leather ""Palm"" case before this body glove case, and I must say that this body glove case makes it really difficult to pop out your phone fast. The Official Palm Brand leather case makes your phone much easier to grab, and the belt clip just seems stronger. Though, this one does look really sleek and provides a somewhat slimmer profile from it's snug fit. If you're debating between the two for your Palm Smartphone, you just have to ask yourself if you'd prefer style or functionality. Overall, this is still a good buy."
1,bad swivel joint,The swivel joint on this case is made with cheap plastic. When getting in and out of my car the case would occasionally catch on the seat belt and eventually the cheap plastic swivel joint broke.
5,Body Glove pouch,Very nice pouch for my Blackberry Pearl 8130. The magnet closer puts the phone into sleep mode.
4,"Works excellent, but","I have the Samsung i730 and with the standard battery it works great (five stars). Easy to remove and replace the phone and it does not fall out (not true with the extended battery).Easily attaches to your belt and nice looking, just be careful with the larger extended battery, as the top does not close."
1,Bait & Switch? ...then lack of customer service,"Per bargaincell's advertisment & website detail, this item is suppossed to be the Body Glove ""Rhythm"" Cellsuit case ""w/ rotating belt clip"". What I received was a Body Glove brand, but not the Rhythm & had NO rotating belt clip. My first experience in feedback to bargaincell seemed to be good for they apologized & said they are immediately sending the correct product w/ postage paid to return the one sent ... but... it never came! I was apparantly lied to! After a month of no shipment, it seems my cries for help have fallen on deaf ears; for they now won't return my emails after another week of trying."
5,"Descent, Not too Bulky","I like this case. It is not too overdone, does what it says in protecting my phone. I was worried how the longer (4.37 inches) Palm Pre 3 would fit into this case, and it happens to fit nicely.Nicely done."
3,Don't waste your money,Will fall apart after a few months.The good thing is that it protected my phone during those few months.
3,Very disappointing!,"Although the pattern is very pretty, the pieces were not as heavy as I anticipated. The product description says ""18/10"" stainless--the best kind of stainless flatware. However, upon receiving the product, the package says, ""18/0,"" an inferior grade. Needless to say, I was very disappointed, since I ordered two sets for my two daughters as a gift. Will be selling them."
5,Love my new flatware!,"I thought this set was cute in the picture, but was so excited when it actually came! It is truly a beautiful set. I have run them through the dishwasher a number of times already and they come out looking like new, and my husband loves the ""larger than normal"" size. I have little hands & I really like them too -they are very sturdy. The biggest bonus, other than the 8 settings plus the 5 piece serving set, is the extra 8 teaspoons!"
1,Not 18/10,"This flatware set is 18/0, not 18/10 as stated in the above product description. Thought the price was too good to be true."
2,Discoloration after 2 dishwasher uses,After washing them in the dishwasher some look like they are starting to rust where the indention part in the design section. I liked the design and they are lightweight flatware. I was very disappointed and surprise at how quickly they started to what appears to be rust.
4,Good quality Boots,"Good boots for the money, only problem my husband had was the sides of the boots would rub on his legs, he is no longer wearing them because of that, could be just the way the boots fit his feet?"
2,should have listened to reviews,"I ordered 3 Russell 100% cotton tees-recevied 3 ""SOFFE"" tees 90% cotton and they are scratchy, not like the Russell's I wear I read a review that said they received their order with the wrong size and product--looks like Amazon ships what they have in inventory hoping you will not return it--I order a lot from Amazon ie Kindle, books and other products, but never again"
3,t-shirt roulette!,"These shirts have proven to be totally different every time I buy them. The last time they fit me well and were tagless. This time they ran a bit small and had obnoxious tags.Will I try again? Probably, because this is the most convenient of several inconsistent sources of shirts like these. Every few months there seems to be a different factory and design. It's t-shirt roulette!"
2,Not combed cotton,"I purchased these for my husband, but we had to return them - even though the description says ""100% ringspun combed cotton"", the tag does not and the t-shirts do not feel like combed cotton at all. The color was nice though.I purchased theECOnscious Men's 100% Organic Cotton Short Sleeve Teet-shirts at the same time, and they were very soft and exactly what I was looking for."
3,Blue and Grey were longer than Gold,"I'm not sure what's the reason, but this T is shorter than the other Soffe colors I ordered here shipped from Amazon.In addition to length, this T has no physical neck tag, but the info is stencilled in place instead.So this must be from a different run or production style or location... something is different.I really like the length longer, looks much cooler.This gold is not anything like gold, as there is not enough synthetic fibers to cause any shine.The color is so so, a little down, pretty much just like in the photo here.I'll wear it, and the thickness is decent."
4,Good quality T shirts,These T shirts have a thicker feel which I like. Plus they have a good feel with good quality material.
2,Not at all what I thought it would be,"This book is good if you you just want to learn about the service of a concierge, but gives no detail on the important facts you need to learn about the career in starting your own concierge business."
4,Useful reference tool,"I have read many of the books in the area, and this is probably the best reference tool / framework I have come across for hospitality / concierge."
5,Love it!,"Buying an all metal scoop is worth the price and I've been very happy with the Norpro brand, so I purchased this scoop. The half tablespoon size makes perfect little cookies. I think the scoop is well made and will hold up over the years."
4,Norpro1- Teaspoon scoop,"This 1 teaspoon scoop is just what I need for uniform size cookies, meatballs.It's easy to use and easy to clean."
4,Be Careful What You Wish For...,"I make the original ""Joy of Cooking"" pecan puff recipe from the 1970's cook book. It took me while to find this since it is not in the newer editions. I searched for for a scoop that would make small, bite sized cookie balls, and decided to get the Norpro Stainless Steel Scoop, 25MM (1.5 teaspoon). Although very well made, the dough stuck inside and didn't come out easily, even after refrigerating for an hour. It was almost too small to work efficiently. The release arm inside didn't push the dough out until you clicked it several times, when make a hundred cookies, that get very tiring.To be fair, this is the only recipe I've tried it on, it's mostly butter and chopped pecans. Maybe it would work better on other recipes. I did like the size of the balls it made and will try it on future recipes."
2,too small for cookies,I sent it back. I was looking for something a little smaller than my one tablesppon scoop. I wish there was a 2 teaspoon scoop.
2,Feels solid and durable,"It makes a small size cookie scoop that is easy to dislodge mushy cookie doughs. For stiffer doughs, it produces a shaving from the scoop mechanism inside the scooper. That can become cumbersome when you have to pick up the shaving after every scoop. It is a keeper, feels solid and durable."
1,Didn't serve it's purpose!!!!,I purchased this to make mini cookies. It is the perfect size but the bar that comes across the cup part doesn't touch the cup at all. I spend more time trying to get the cookie dough out than what it is worth.
3,read all product descrition...,"I ordered this one and one other size, but as I got one that fitted the measure, the other one didn't, it was much bigger than the one I ordered... They will still be handy for me, but they sent me one I already had, so I was ordering this others as to complete my cookie making stuff..."
4,Love my cupcake batter scoop!,"I had never owned one of these before December, even though I cook and bake a lot. But after using it I ordered the rest of the sizes for myself, as well as cupcake scoops for my daughters for Valentines. Great kitchen tool."
5,No complaints,"Now this is an air hose! It's overkill for everyday applications, but the quality is great. I bought one of these five years ago, and I use it to connect the compressor (in the back of the garage) to my filter and regulator (in the front of the garage) - I didn't want to bother with running pipe for such a short distance. But aside from specialty applications where you absolutely have to minimize pressure drop, this hose is more than you'll need. If, for whatever reason, you DO need a 1/2"" hose, then you'll be happy with this one. Otherwise, buy the yellow 3/8"" model - that's a great hose, too."
3,fittings,"I should have read the reviews, it would have saved me a lot of trouble. I didnt know that the ends are 3/8 and not 1/2"" I ordered all of my fittings for that size and now I cant use them. my mistake but it should have something in description."
2,No fitting size in listing!,"I was totally dissapointed when this hose arrived. The brass fittings are 3/8"" instead of 1/2"" I lokked an d looked on the web site and I didn't see any size listed except for 1/2""."
3,Old School Joint,"Old School Joint is the best track by far! Buy it if only for this!! As an album, its pretty good - but not as good as her debut release."
3,Great story but lukewarm romance,"Burke Basile is a man on a mission -- to kill the white collar criminal who's behind the death of his partner. He kidnaps the man's wife to lure out the crook, and falls in love with her...Herein lies the problem... how and WHY does he fall in love? The criminal justice aspect of this story is solid, but the romance is quick, flawed and unbelievable. Burke's got no reason to love her, other than her good looks. Expect a good plot, and ignore the attempt at making this a ROMANTIC suspense. The overall story is good."
2,The central relationship seems superficial.,"Wasn't there a 1986 film called ""No Mercy"" starring Richard Gere and Kim Bassinger that had a storyline, setting and many plot elements very similar to those we encounter in Fat Tuesday? The characters in the film had a much more intense relationship. The main characters in the book don't actually meet until page 137 but are involved from a distance. The reader rarely sees them very closely involved until the epilogue. There is no mystery and little suspense."
1,fat tuesday,"Boring. Just another formula written story, rehashing old plots, with boring characters, could barely finish it"
2,"Falls flat, no meat. Your reading styrofoam.","Fat Tuesday is sure no Executive. The story line is thin, and where there could be a little more the plot, it leaves you flat. You start with a villian you love to hate and add a hand raised virgin bride, who though seems to be some what intelligent, is too whimpy for words. This is where the editors let the audience, readers, down. There could of been more character added to the heroine, a little more to let you know what she had to face. Instead they give you the ice queen. By the time you figure out what she is facing you don't care.The hero is a stressed out cop, who is guilty of shooting his own partner. Sandra lets out too much information on the whys in his character structure, why the underlying guilt, and what he is up against.Personally I was looking for another block buster, I got a whimp. It should of been called Thin Tuesday--- get yourself a new editor, they let us down on this one."
2,Very disappointing,"I have read nearly every book Sandra Brown has written and am a very big fan. I bought this book even after reading the less-than-rave reviews of other fans. I wish I had took their words to heart and left this one at the store. This book lacked the usual sizzle associated with this author and I had a hard time believing the roles of hero and heroine. I guess I took for granted that since it was Sandra Brown, she could write no wrong. In the future I will treat her like every other author and take a close look before I buy."
3,"Okay, but not one of her best!!!","This one was OK. I am too used to the steamy style of her other books. As a regular novel it is OK. She is better off sticking to her romance novels. Slow Heat in Heaven is good, as is Mirror Image."
4,Fat Tuesday- A Good Novel,"Fat Tuesday is one of Sandra Brown's best novels, yet I found myself wondering, why is Basile so caught up with killing this hot to trot lawyer and his cronies? He just needed to take a break from being a cop. Remy, the female lead, was very dull. There was not as much romance as I prefer, but it was still a very good read and kept me up late at night. Bravo, Ms. Brown! Thank you for keeping me entertained all these years!"
4,To my liking!,"I've never been much of a reader, this was the second book that I picked up to read. This was the first book of Sandra Browns that I've had the honor to read. I usually pick up a book and if it does not grip me from the beginning I will not finish it. I read this book back a few months ago and it is still fresh in my mind. So I would have to say that it is a great book!"
1,stick to romance novels,"I'm normally a mystery reader. Ms. Brown's story is very implausible. Can someone tell me: if Burke ""dropped his pistol and covered his ears"" who on earth shot Pinkie?? I was very disappointed with this book."
2,MY New Orleans isn't like this!,"New Orleans is my favorite city on the planet. She has everything, and you either love her at once or you never understand her at all.What Sandra Brown fails to realize is that New Orleans embraces all walks of life with the same enthusiasm. Yes, Pinky was a crook and a bad guy, but in New Orleans, he'd fit in just fine with the elite.I might have bought the good cop takes on the bad guy in some other city, but, not in New Orleans. In New Orleans, they sit side by side at the Acme Oyster Bar.Besides missing New Orleans' character all together, Brown's story really isn't too tightly woven. I didn't really feel sorry for Pinky's trapped wife and I really didn't much like the crusading cop.To me, this book just flat misses the mark."
4,"Slow start, Great ending","Burke Basille is one of a few good men, a cop in New Orleans Narcotic Department trying to bring the bad to justice. When a drug bust goes horribly wrong, and the Justice Department fails him, Burke quits his job in order to get the bad guys, including rotten cops, no matter the cost.The characters we great, you really got a sense on who they are and why they are the way they are.I gave this book four stars because the beginning was very slow and I had to force myself to stay interested. But from about the middle on I couldn't put the book down. The ending fully made up for the slow start, I'm glad I kept reading!"
3,A Lot Different for S. Brown,"I always thought Sandra Brown was all romance stories,but I happened to pick this book up at work. It's a pretty good action/adventure story, but the mystery plot isn't as tight as I'd like. Pinkie Duval is a great character, and Ms. Brown portrays him very well. Same with Burke Basile. I loved the setting since I love to read books set in New Orleans, and that is the main reason I read this book. The mystery is quite easy to figure out, but that doesn't make the book fun to read. The description of the swamps and that particular setting in this book is very good."
3,Are there two Sandra Brown's?,"I think there must be two Sandra Brown's because some of the books I read are the wonderful romance books I love like Breakfast in Bed, and then some are filled with murder and mayhem. I don't enjoy the latter, but I know that's just my taste. If you don't care for it either, skip this one."
3,"not a quality read, but I enjoyed it!","the story is predictable, the love story emerges out of almost nowhere with no apperent motive other than ""they're both good looking and miserable"", and there' not much safistication all on all. But something there worked for me - the hero (Basile) is meaner to his hostage at first than I'd rather he be (making it a little hard to understand why she fell for him), but you forgive him and route for him. the heroine is a little shallow, but you route for her too. It's not tolstoy, but it's an enjoyable read. liked it MUCH more than Honor Bound and ""Hawk O'toole's hostage"", liked it a little less than ""Leathel"". would read Brown's next one..."
3,Not the best from Sandra Brown,"This wasn't my favorite Sandra Brown. While Pinkie Duvall makes an especially dastardly bad guy (I don't think he had even one redeeming characteristic), I wasn't that taken with Burke Basile. Frankly, I thought his revenge ""plan"" was a little ridiculous. But there are some bright spots... I did like Remy, and Brown does a good job with the red herrings and keeping you guessing. Though I did guess who the police mole was, I was doubting myself before the final reveal. This wasn't a horrible book, but it was certainly no Envy."
1,"Does ""No Mercy"" ring a bell??","Didn't we see a bad Gere and Basinger movie in 1986 called No Mercy that was more or less like this one, even down to New Orleans. Besides that what was the author thinking...or maybe she wasn't thinking at all. God bless Remy, the amount of ""trauma"" in her life didn't make me empathize with her, but amused me because it was so contrived. If you want to enjoy a Brown, read ""Where There's Smoke.""Fat Tuesday is a whole of grease and no substance."
2,Poor writing embarrasses me when I read it.,"I'm somewhat new to reading crime novels, but I know there are better writers out there. FT's plot & characters are interesting and well-developed, but Brown's writing is full of cliche and overused metaphors. I couldn't loose myself in the well-crafted story because I was embarrassed for the author. I will likely try another of Brown's novels before I give up on her, but I can't take much more like this one."
2,Only for a true fan.,"I thought it would be nice to have this versions of songs I enjoy, but it simply isn't like the original."
5,Glad to have it,"I was so happy when I got this in the mail, I've collected all 5 seasons and I was excited to see the 6th season on Amazon. Very happy with the product."
3,Tina Aucoin,"I LOVE this show...one of my all time favorites...reminds me so much of me and my GIrlfriends. I eagerly await this each season's release; but, this one was somewhat of a disappointment. The plots and story lines were not as good as those of the first five seasons. Hopefully, the seventh season will make up for this one."
3,Well.....,"Now I understand why they took it off the air. I loved Girlfriends but this episode wasn't one of the greatest. Season's 1-5 were great but this one well.... it started to get boring and a little corny.I plan on getting the whole season though because I already own 1 -6 and want to complete the whole set.All 4 girls made the show, once Toni left it just went down hill from there!!!"
3,surfer/ holloween gem,"this surf music gem from 1964 is a great cd.with background comments from Igor its gets double duty as a holloween cd.if you like surf music then then ""It's Monster Surfing Time"" has a spot in your collection"
5,"It is the best thing I ever read, on bets of music..I win","This book is the best I have ever read, it is useful for my radio show on KSGO..It is one of the best resources I have, I read it everyday.there are things I did not know. and when I get into music trivia..everyone wants me on their team..and I am never challenged...GR. Gaule gm/owner KSGO Radio Loveland Co."
3,Good for developers,"This book has been written from a VB programmers point of view. If you want to just start creating reports or if you're not a VB programmer (ie DBA etc) you may find this hard work.As another reviewer mentioned, you may find the authors' jokes and writing style to be a hit and miss affair.Nevertheless, there is some depth on Reporting Services not to be found elsewhere that is quite handy."
2,"Tiny, tiny, tiny",I could not believe how small this was when I opened the box. Too many pieces to clean for each use. Good for slicing garlic cloves or baby carrots.
1,Don't waste your money,Design of this product is awkward and counter intuitive (in that it doesn't work the way you would think it should based on its design). The vegetable holder is supposed to fit on the slicer apparatus however once it's attached it won't move when you add a vegetable and try to move it with the vegetable in place. Would be great ifit actually worked... nice idea poor execution.
5,A Vastly Underrated CD,"...from a vastly underrated duo. This couple can sing their...you know what I mean. They never really got thier due because perhaps they were overshadowed by their years in the Fifth Dimension, the group evvybody thought had too many pop hits to really be anything but a blip on the history of music. That just ain't so. The Fifth and McCoo and Davis were talented vocalists who made it big. Really, really, really big. So big that I remember McCoo & Davis had a summer variety TV show--and their sound is so great that the word chemistry doesn't do it justice. Maybe it was kismet, I dunno. But listen to the title track, ""I Hope..."" and the Tony Hester cut ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Me"" and decide for yourself. I love these two!"
4,GOOD LISTENING,"Truth is, I didn't buy this CD; I could hire Marilyn and Billy to perform it for me these days for what it costs. I DO have the original LP in great condition though. I play it perhaps twice a year. I've always wondered why the title song, a bit more sentimental than the follow-up, ""You Don't Have to Be a Star"" wasn't a bigger hit. Apparently it did leave the public hungry for more since ""You Don't Have to Be a Star"" gets regular play on oldies stations. At a reasonable price, those two songs would make this a good buy and the rest would be gravy. If money means nothing to you, by all means, lay your money down and enjoy. The album is most pleasant."
4,Very Good for Beginners,"This is a very good book for beginners. The book is broken down into general sections (body, electrical, engine, etc), and typically each page has a drawing and about half a page of text. While some people have mentioned this book is good for juveniles, this is also a great book for adults who don't know much about cars - you'll get good information on the basics without being overwhelmed by details. You can always get a more detailed book if you like this one, but this is good enough to let you speak intelligently with your mechanic. The only complaint I have is that some of the drawings seem slightly amateurish, but they do seem accurate. This is a very small complaint, other than that, great book!"
2,How Cars Work.,Out of date technological today. even the drawings were old and not up to what you would think from looking at the cover.
4,A must have for all drivers!,"This book was bought after some significant research. I wanted a simplistic book that anyone who drives, especially their own vehicle would appreciate and understand about the basic workings of a car and its systems. The author presents the information accurately and in a manner which presents the reading as somewhat light, not as if one were reading a textbook.My wife took a flip through and told me that she would like to read it too! The book would have been made even better with a little colour to the pictures and diagrams.All in all, an excellent addition to my automotive library!"
4,how cars work,"Great book. Received it in great condition, and I find it very simple and helpful. It explains the name of car parts and their functions. The picture alongside of the text helps to understand how the pieces go together, and then you can imagine how that corresponds to your individual car."
2,No good,The author is an owner and operator of a tutoring center. He is not an expert in auto mechanics. As he points out on the back cover the pictures and the concepts were for teenage boys and the accompanying graphics are of poor quality.If you actually want to learn anything substative of autos this is a poor poor choice. You are better of visiting the automotive section of www.howstuffworks.com or some similar website to learn more with better graphics and for free.I bought this book long time ago and finally had the time to look at it and I regret it.
2,Mechanics only!,"Too bland. Will be helpful only for a mechanic. To give it a little benefit of the doubt, it was a little simplified, in some places anyway."
4,A little elementary but overall good.,The book is for the novice but it still has some useful information. Very basic information on car engines and how they work.
5,Would Recommend to Anyone,"This book is intended for the individual who knows very little to nothing about auto mechanics. Each page covers one specific aspect of how a vehicle operates with a short and simple explanation accompanied with large and detailed diagrams. There are seven chapters over the seven most essential automotive systems with a brief test at the end of each. One cannot rebuild a car after reading through this book, but what it does give is an overall knowledge of how a car works. The reader will gain the knowledge to understand what is going on in a mechanic's shop and to better maintain his or her own vehicle. This book is not for someone who already knows the basics of or has worked on automotive systems. However, it is excellent for anyone who has never picked up a wrench or wants a brief introduction to the subject."
2,Too much old crap and unnecessary info!,"The diagrams in the book where nice, but man this guy isn't an author. You can tell he knows what he is talking about but he just uses a lot of lingo. Thankfully, there is a glossary, but it takes too long to look up every word. He just tells you the different parts in mechanisms. He doesn't really explain how anything works. By the way, he has like 5 nicknames for every part. If you are a beginner too complex, if your an expert you probably know this stuff. If you have the money and your an amateur go ahead. If none of the above I wouldn't suggest this book."
1,Definetly CHEAP fishing line...,This line is just cheap line that is almost not worth spooling up on... Full of kinks and twists... breaks really easy too... do yourself a favor and buy Stren or Trilene instead...
4,A worthwhile read,"Rick McKinley's ""Jesus in the Margins: Finding God in the Places We Ignore"" is a worthwhile read for followers of Christ. It reveals some profound truths about Jesus' attitude toward those who our society considers ""down and out"" and presents its readers with the opportunity to do a self-examination with regards to his/her attitudes toward other people to don't readily fit his/her ideals. It is a bit repetitive at times, but all in all is a quick and meaninful read. Ultimately I believe it has inspired me to be a better lover of Jesus and my fellow man.RJC"
3,Good,"Good book. The author has some good things to say, but it's not written with much technique. Simply written, not thought-provoking. A good read for a few if you need to hear what he has to say, and to pass the time, I suppose."
2,Practice what you preach,"When you talk about people being in the margins, you need to address the groups of people that you yourself put in the margins. This is a great book, there are a lot of them out there, but when you look below the surface and actually see that the author himself takes part in putting people in the margins, it makes a normal person ask ""what's going on here""?The author lives in a town that marginalizes women in the first place. Portland has more strip clubs per capita then Las Vegas. In the mayoral debate held at Imago he addressed the issue of the sex trade with all three candidates as being a problem, it is.But in his own church, the practice of the ""good ole boy club"" lives on and women are not allowed in certain leadership roles, such as preaching. You cannot marginalize and then speak of it being a bad thing. There is a word for that.....hypocrisy!"
1,"Item backordered, and could not get it in time for Christmas as promised!","I just found out that this shirt back-ordered after I was promised by Amazon BEFORE I ordered it that I will receive this item before December 23. I just now received notification that this item was shipped on the 24th, and I had purchased it on the 15th. This means I will not get it until after December 26th!Because I bought this shirt to go with some camo pants for my sister, I was only able to give her pants without the shirt for Christmas. She had to leave back across country, and I am forced to send this shirt to her. How embarressing! Obviously it is Christmas time and if you're going to have a storefront on Amazon.com, you better get extra stock! The worse way to keep a happy customer is by backordering on Christmas and ruining a family member's present. Beware folks, you may not get this item when it says you will."
2,Snoozville,Nearly every cut of this album is a digrace to everythingGeorge Benson represents.From his obvious face job on the cover and the souless elevator muzak inside his 'Breezin'-era material sounds like HARDCORE funk-jazz by comparasin!But at the end he sticks on a swingin' rendition of Bobby Darin'sstandard reinvented but another talented singer.It's one ofGeorge Benson's best numbers and the ONLY thing making thisdull album worth anything.But borrow this from a friend;it isn'tworth your time to buy it.
1,20/20 Hindsight - Wish I hadn't done it.,"I hope that's what George Benson thought after his experience with 20/20.I have been a George Benson fan since I first discovered his music in the very early seventies. His skills with the guitar made him a stand out and in my opinion in the same league as Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, and other jazz guitarist greats. It seems GB has never been satisified with his success as a Jazz musician. His occassional flirts with or forrays into what is popular at the moment, perhaps seeking pop fame or a mega hit, has resulted in some very, very weak recordings. 20/20 epitomizes the depths to which he can sink when he follows the wave rather than follows his heart.I say the following in the most sincere way. In the immortal words of Frank Zappa ""Shut Up & Play Your Guitar."""
5,cool benson,"This is a talented man--able to play the guitar, as well as a beautiful singing voice. His music is very nice."
2,not very complex from the sax end,"I can hear some really good sax from the yellowjackets, and this one just seems kind of slow. It sounds like a lot of keyboard sampling and easy Kenny-G'ish tones, very pop. I have had a chance to listen to other Yellowjackets releases though, and they put this one to shame. Thumbs on your own octave keys people."
3,Old Yellow Jackets,"If you're a Bob Mitzer fan, you probably won't care for this album. This is one of their earlier albums and they hadn't ""found"" themselves yet, IMO."
5,Samurai Samba is fantastic!,I have loved listening to this group for over 20 years. The music is uplifting and flexible to your mood and can even change your mood if you allow it to. It's a great expression of emotions in music. Enjoy!!! Jazz baby Jazz.....
1,Don't buy this if you want quality,"The prints for each film are BAD, they are NOT digitally re-mastered and jump all over the place. The films were never meant to be widescreen anyway. Please Google ""Firecake Entertainment"" before you buy, you might be interested at the very few results. As another reviewer said about their release of 'The Buccaneer'. ""It defines the word rip-off"". So true. Also check the review above, it is just a copy of the release blurb isn't it."
3,Approach with skepticism...,"One approaches this book with an air of caution and curiosity as to the author's motives. I stumbled upon this after reading Lauren Bacall's wonderful autobiography which, incidentally, was published a few short years before Bogie & Me. I have to wonder if the attention given to Ms. Bacall's bio was Ms. Thompson's motivation for writing this memoir.Ms. Thompson actually explains that her motivation is that Bogie would love to see her shake everyone up with the information that he had a long-time mistress, since he loved shocking people. No doubt his wife and children were shaken up by the news.I had hoped to come away from this book believing that this woman is a con, but some of it rings true. That said, I think you could call this more of a collection of anecdotes rather than a thoughtful and introspective memoir. The author remains morally ambiguous throughout the text. At any rate, a lot can be learned from this book about Bogie's personality."
1,Wishful Thinking And Spiteful Jealousy Perhaps?,"This book details a clandestine affair between the author and hard drinking Hollywood Star Humphrey Bogart while he was married to Ms. Lauren Bacall. Wether or not this affair actually happened or is just ""wishful think"" on behalf of Ms. Thompson is open to debate. The author has quite a few unflattering things to say about Ms. Bacall who I believe is one of the few actresses left in Hollywood with any real Class which is a rarity these days. One gets the impression that Ms. Thompson was and is very jealous of the fact that Ms. Bacall was Humphrey Bogart's Legal wife and she wanted to be that instead of just being his mistress.I do find it very sad and pathetic that some unknown hairdresser tries to ""cash in"" on a deceased celebrity's fame who is not around to offer his version of events. I give this book one star and intend to thrown it into the trash can where it belongs."
5,susan hayward....WOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"tHE ARTISTRY IN THIS IS GREAT!Miss Hayward is perfectly captured in a very beautiful doll.Doris Day and especially Audery Hepburnare perfectly drawn.Miss Reynolds and Jane Russell are outstanding, with Jane in the killer Red dress from Gentlemen prefere Blondes.Where's Marilyn is my only complaint.But each inclusion here is great."
2,Random selection of phone messages !?!,"A selection of quirky pieces. Most are phone message left for the kitchen sisters. Some good, some just ramble on and on. I am a fan of the show so I was expecting more."
5,"Hidden Kitchens: Stories , Recipes and more from NPR's The Kitchen Sisters arrived fast and in excellent condition.","The book arrived fast and in excellent condition, but many of the recipes weren't that interesting, better to check out Clementine Paddleford's classic book How America Eats !"
1,Poorly Written - No Facts,Many will not even touch this book due to the intro by Buzz Aldrin. You can find true accounts about the pre-Iraq invasion weather changing work that Ilan Ramon did to save the Kinneret on the internet for those that are curious.
3,It is just ok,Not very satisfied. The duck is very cute but does not make a flapping noise. I was looking for a flapping duck since my son loved a similar duck push toy that he played with at a friend's house. This one does not compare and he stops playing with it a minute after picking it up.
2,Just Awfull,"Price doesn't always correlate with quality. So proves the Norpro. I found that this unit is clumsy and clogs often. The guard (sold separately) will not admit reasonably sized items, e.g. a large potato, doesn't secure the item to be sliced, and leaves an annoying amount of waste. Their legal department should take a look at the policy of selling the mandoline without a guard. You are looking at some serious time in the emergency room without it. I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Save your money,I got this because I thought a stainless steel mandoline must be the greatest thing. It is good but cumbersome to use and clean. I ended up buying a plastic Japanese version for $20 works as well or better and although I bought another one after 2 years the first one works great still. Don't get impressed by fanciness like I did.
2,Too Much T.V.,"Welcome, so you're thinking about reading Tru Confessions by Janet Tashjian? Well, I have some information about it. First I'll talk about Tru.She is a 12 year old girl that is really energized when she was watching T.V. There was a commercial about a new network in town. Then Tru really wanted to have a T.V. show. Eddie, Tru's brother, is handicapped because when he was a baby his umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck. Eddie is the camera man for Tru's T.V. show.Their problem is getting Tru's tape (T.V. show episodes), to the cable company. When Tru's mom is at work she goes on the computer and tries to find a cure for Eddie.The book doesn't tell where Tru and Eddie live, but somewhere in a city. The good thing about Tru Confessions is you learn more about mentally disabled and challenged people. They can be more nice and caring than you can see. I don't think people should read this book because it needs to focus on other things than just her brother, Eddie, or Tru's T.V. show."
3,Good Story but...,I really like the idea of the the story. It is truly and eye opener. The book didnt have much of a plot and it was rather hard to stay interested.
4,True Confessions,"Twelve-year-old Trudy Walker has two dreams: to find a cure for her developmentally delayed twin brother and to have her own television show. She is able to combine both dreams when she enters her video about her brother in a local cable show contest and wins. She tells her story via an electronic diary format, and her entries are both poignant and insightful with a touch of humor thrown in which make for a great read."
4,Tru Confessions,"I really like the novel. It was very descriptive with people, places, and things. It also had a wonderful selection of characters with great personalities. The explainations really caught my attention. It's excellent reading.The best part of the book was when Tru was showing her film to her friends. I thought that it was funny how they all thought that it was borning. And Eddy was very bored except for when he saw himself.I think that the most vivid story elements were Tru and her imagination. She just had such realistic dreams. As well as the steps she took to persue them. She had downfalls and up points. Another vivid element was the theme of the story. Tu wanted to succeed in the filming industry and that dream and theme is realistic."
5,Great Story,This book is so good! I love books that are writen like journal. You will love it. trus brother is handy cap but he is a good brother. You will love it if you read it.
5,Tru Confessions the Movie,"I havent read the book, but I just saw the movie, and I Cried my eyes out. It was so emotional and moving. Tru finds herself, and stops worrieing about what other people say. I Would highly recommend this book and the movie. watch the movie april 6th 2002 at 8/7c on the disney channel for the encore presentation!thanks!~*Jess*~"
5,Great!,"They made a Disney Channel movie after this book, so I had to buy it!! the story itself is wonderful, and the seller's copy was in perfect condition!"
5,Great for closet shelf,"I love these shelves! I bought two to organize our sweatshirts on our closed shelf, they work great and takes a bunch of bulk out of our dresser."
3,Good but not what I expected,"This book is all scriptures, I was expecting some stories and examples on how to live as an unmarried believer and that is not what I found."
3,One size does not fit all,"This product is another quality product for sure, and is great if you are using wide mouth jars or anything 32oz and up. I recently switched to 24oz. jars and was disappointed when the product arrived and discovered it did not fit anything smaller that 32oz or Wide Mouth jars. So its a great product if you are using those size jars."
5,canning made easy,"When ordering this product, I was leary of the size and function of this product. I canned during the summer and after getting this product, I was glad I did. It made canning much easier to do."
4,GOOD STUFF GOES RIGHT THROUGH,"AT LAST: NO MESS FROM THE SMALL SPOUT FUNNELS MY WIFE HAD BEEN USING. NO WORRIES ABOUT MELTING AND DISTORTING, STAINS, OVERFLOW, KNOWING WHEN IT IS CLEAN, AND NO MORE CLOGGING WITH THICK STUFF. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY."
5,Perfect,I am so glad I got this funnel. I specifically bought this one after reading that it fits into the ball wide mouth jars and it does! Less mess in the kitchen as I can snugly fit the funnel in the jar and then use my hands to pour in whatever I am canning. Thanks Norpro it was just what I needed.Edit: It also fits into the small ball jars perfectly too. I made a hole in one with this one!
5,Perfect Function--High Quality--Excellent Funnel,"I bought this funnel for canning. So far I have used it for making jam and it functions perfectly for what it was created! It fits perfectly into the jars without space to wobble back and forth--it's a perfect fit! (On standard mouth jars, that is.) And wide! It catches everything. You would have to work hard to dribble over the edge of this thing (within reason). And it is quality stainless steel, thicker and stronger that some funnels I've used. It will definitely resist denting. Plus, it will look great for years to come. Excellent product!"
1,Not Sturdy,"We bought this last month. We just started using it a week ago, and the handle is already breaking off! We are still using one we bought about 10 years ago (a different brand), and haven't had one problem with that one. Very disappointing funnel."
1,"so cheap, it'll cut your hand",the bottom if the norpro funnel is sharp. it cut my hand.how often do you buy a funnel? do yourself a favor and buy one that you don't have to be careful with...
5,Alycia,I know this Funnel is for canning but I bought it for another reason but would not work for what I bought it for but if I canned it would work fantastic. So if you do canning it would be a great item to have to fill your jars.
4,A nice piece of equipment,"Its well made, fits my standard wide-mouth jars, and cleans up well. Because its stainless steel it doesn't react to my fermented pickle brine and it cleans up easily since I can heat it a little. This is much better than a cheaper plastic one and worth the extra price."
1,Misleading inaccurate product description,"In canning terms, this product is NOT a ""Wide-Mouth"" funnel. The ""mouth"" as described on the label is only 2 1/4"" which is the size for a Regular canning jar. Wide-mouth jars are 3"" diameter and it is usually understood that a ""wide-mouth funnel"" is used for inserting large pieces, e.g., pear halves or peach halves, into wide-mouth jars.Furthermore, if the Amazon description gave basic specifications (opening measurements), I could have learned this before ordering."
3,nice wide mouth funnel for jam making,"I haven't used it yet, but I'm pleased with the quality so far. Jam making isn't for another few months, so I'm looking forward to using it before that ladling soup and hot chocolate into their respective containers."
5,very helpful,"I really only use this thing for filling up canning jars, which is does very well. It cleans easily and the handle is still attached, so I'm happy with it."
2,Could be better if,"I purchased the funnel because it is stainless steel and I believe it to be more sanitary than the plastic one I use. The only draw back to this funnel is the neck going down into the mouth of the jar is not long enough for my liking, so I can not use it and asked my husband to give me my old one back that I had given him for garage use when I bought this beautiful stainless one.Happy canning from Georgia."
2,Good design but poor quality control.,"I agree with the positive reviews here in that it is actually wide enough for what you need. The durability however is somewhat suspect. I purchased this in September and was initially happy with it but after only 4 months the handle broke off. It wasn't dropped or damaged in any way. The handle just fell off. I would assume its a problem with it not being welded on properly but thats a strong lack of quality control.Unfortunately, this product is ""made in china for norpro"" which means the company has a good design but the factory that produces this is has spotty quality. The system they operate under means the actual manufacturer is never disclosed. If you want this product I recommend doing a thorough test of it after purchase and return if there's any kind of issue."
1,Not what Amazon promised,This was listed under the Made in USA section. IT IS MADE IN CHINA. Otherwise the product is as described.
5,No more twist and shout.,"This QuickWinder was one of my best buys ever. I used to wrap up my extension cords around my arm, and they would twist and kink. It was a mess.This QuickWinder make it so easy yo load and unload your cords. Every time I have it outside, I get oohs and ahhhs from people saying what a great idea.It is a great idea."
3,"A good story, all things considered","The main character works as an anti-hero. I didn't like his evident homosexuality--my own views in that regard are not liberal ones. But the story is interesting, the dialog natural, the characterization (usually) somewhat appealing, and the plot flows along smoothly, if slowly here and there. A far better book in this same general style is L.E. Modesitt Jr.'s ""The Magic of Recluse."" But The Quartered Sea is worth reading, say, when the electricity goes off in your house and you have nothing better to do."
4,Happy son-in-law,"My son-in-laws favorite candy bar when he was a child was the Marathon bar. Always wishing they were still available, well these are almost identical."
4,Yum!,The candy bar was good. Much less smaller than what I remember the Marathon bar as. It did have a tendancy to break. That could be the weather/coldness. Good though.
5,Fab!,I ordered these for my Sis who is British but moved to America a few years ago. I was really pleased with how quickly they arrived and she really appreciated them as they were a childhood favourite!
4,Fast delivery of so-so product,"I dunno...are Curly Wurlies supposed to be a little on the toffee-hard side? One was broken, whiich is understandable considering their thin-ness. The wrapper wasn't broken, however, so it was edible.Fast delivery! Love it when my hubby and I get a Cadbury craving."
3,Sweet,"I don't know if it's just me, but too many varieties of Cadbury chocolate are just too sweet! The Cadbury eggs and dairy milk bars are the best, but still quite sweet. The curly wurly bars are just not good enough to be worth the price, if you like really sweet chocolate, then get them, but if you're not a fan of really sweet chocolate then I advise against buying these."
1,A very poor copy of the original,"While I am well aware that Cadbury does make some excellent products, the Curly Wurly's are not one of them. These candy bars are NOTHING like the original Marathon Bar's from the 1970's, except in appearance. The chocolate coating is much to thin on the Curly Wurly's compared to the original Marathon Bar's and the caramel has a distinct buttery taste which the Marathon Bar did not. The Curly Wurly's are ok if your just looking for a chocolate candy bar with a different taste, but I personally will not ever buy them again."
4,As Close as You'll Get to Being a Kid in the 70s,"I've already said great things about this company and the Curly Wurly bars when I rated this transaction (excellent), but I wanted to give a thumbs up in the regular section as well. I grew up watching movies with a Marathon bar melting in my mouth until the bar was discontinued in the early 80s. I've missed it ever since. Then I discovered that they were kind of available as the Curly Wurly bar. I decided to go for it. I waited to eat my first one at a special screening of Superman 2 (when I most likely ate a Marathon while watching it originally in 1980). Not only does the Curly Wurly look like Marathon, it tastes like Marathon. A little chocolate/caramel miracle. These bars really taste like no other and, a plus, are only 115 calories per bar. I don't metabolize like I did in 1980, so that's good. I highly recommend this movie-time treat."
3,pretty stale,"These chocolate and caramel bars arrived in a timely fashion, but must have been sitting around for a while, or improperly stored, or both, as most of the chocolate crumbled off brittle style, and the caramel was very hard to chew. The 2012 London Olympics logo would have been a tip off had I noticed it."
1,terrible shipping,The candy have probably been good if it wasn't for the fact that they were almost destroyed when I received them. The box was huge for just 6 candy bars and after being thrown around for so long the box had been busted open and when I opened the candy it was broken into pieces and chocolate crumbs fell every where. I'm very unhappy.
5,it's hawkwind man,"hawkwind master of the universe and at the moment in time in the early seventies hawkwind were the leaders of space rock punk with their fantastic single ""silver machine"" here live and a fantastic version i must add had everything going for them they made quite a few classics in the seventies and this cd i found in hmv fot about 3.00 yeash i know a bargainother classics what have been showcased live are ""motorhead"" the band lemmy formed after he was kicked out of hawkwind after being busted for drug possesion and if lemmy wouldn't of been kicked out we would of never got that classic deafning bandother classic live tracks are""spirit of age"" ""british tribal music""""quark strangness and charm"" ""dealing with the devil""here came hawkwind flying in to take you down"
2,Space Punk and the Early Signs of Grundge,"Hawkwind was one of those bands of the 70's that didn't have a lot of commercial success, but had a strong cult following. Their recordings are usually not the best. This one is no exception. I don't really care for any of the tracks on this CD. But, I'll give them credit for their originality of space punk with a hint of the early signs of grundge. It's easy to see that someone like Metallica could have been influenced by this band."
1,scoop,This product lasted 2 days before the scoop part wouldn't retract back to where it should be and has never worked right since. Don't buy it..
1,"Broke on 2nd Use, Scooping Out Cookies!","I bought two sizes, the 3 tbsp and the 1 tbsp. When I received them, I was happy to see that the scoops are of very sturdy construction---seems it would last a lifetime of use in the kitchen. Boy, was I wrong! I have only used the 3 tbsp scoop for making oatmeal cookies and that on only two occasions. The first time, the scoop worked wonderfully. It turned out 15 perfectly scooped cookies. The second time, the inner piece popped out after scooping like the 10th cookie! Why it happened I do not know, as I was just scooping out cookies. Now the inner piece shows 1/3 of the way on the outside. Terrible to use after it popped out, the scoop cannot even pop out the cookie anymore. I have yet to use the 1 tbsp scoop and I'm afraid to find out that I've wasted money on two of these. And for their price, I expected longer usability."
5,Great scoop and very high quality.,"I use scoops or cookies or for measuring. This is a very high quality scoop, even for stiff dough. I highly recommend this scoop."
3,NOT 2 tablespoon scoop!,"This scoop seems of good quality (though I haven't used it yet, I do have the 2 teaspoon scoop by Norpro which I'm happy with), but the scoop holds way MORE than 2 tablespoons -- it's more like 2 1/2 - 3 tablespoons. What is most surprising is that even the tag that comes with the product states clearly that it holds 2 tablespoons -- wrong!! Didn't the manufacturers bother to confirm this ""minor"" little detail? If you're seeking accuracy, don't buy this product. Also, there is no way that it would be durable enough to scoop ice cream. Stick to scooping soft things like cookie dough and mashed potatoes, and you'll be happy with this product."
1,NOT Norpro,"This product came in a package that was falling apart, with no indication it was a Norpro product anywhere on it. The first time I squeezed the handle it broke, so I threw it away. Absolute garbage and false advertising. Not stainless steel, not worth a penny."
1,defective,The spring on the one I received was defective and I had to return the item. The inside piece just kept sticking.
3,50/50,"I bought two of these - one for work and one for home. The one for work is perfect, months after I bought it. The one at home, the release mechanism leaves a lot to be desired. (FYI - I use both scoopers on peanut butter)"
2,Keeps breaking,I find that if you have hard ice cream to scoop the more this ice cream scooper breaks. Squeezing this hard sometimes pushes it out of it's gears and it is a pain to get it back on line.More of a headache than useful..
1,Painful,"It may work O.K. for melons, but the handle is extremely uncomfortable and ackward to grip when attempting to scoop ice cream. In addition, the shape of the scoop bowl makes it difficult to get a full scoop of ice cream."
1,Broke/Misfired on the 2nd pan of cookies,"I was excited about this, as a left handed person, most dishers require me to scoop with my left hand then transfer it to my right hand for dispensing. Having a disher that worked with either hand was going to be great. The first pan of cookies it worked flawlessly, but on the second pan as I squeezed it to release it skipped a gear and the clearing mechanism partially came out of the bowl. Each consecutive scoop it skipped another gear/prong. I WAS able to get it back to the original position, but for every pan afterwards I had to repair it at least once. If it breaks on cookie dough, I can't imagine it would work for ice cream or anything else. It is probably not worth sending back, but really can't recommend this brand of disher."
1,Deceived and disappointed!,"I ordered this scoop believing it to be, as advertised, a Norpro scoop from Amazon. Instead, what I received was a no-name brand scoop that looked like it came from a dusty dollar store rack. I had ordered three different sizes of scoops. All three were advertised as being Norpro and sold by Amazon. One actually was. I was able to compare it to this one and both the packaging and the quality of the items were vastly different. In addition, instead of being sold by Amazon, the packing slip states that it, and the other no-name scoop, were sold by ""Jayson Trading Company"". It is already packed to go back. What a disappointment!"
5,$9.59 for batter portions,I bought this for waffle cones but it must be more than 2 tablespoons as another reviewer reports.
3,IT'S OKAY!,"This got quite a rip. Worst thing ever? I hardly think so.It's certainly not the best thing either.If your friends laugh at you owning this, find new friends.I found it quite listenable."
1,horrible,"This Recording... is quite possibly. The worst thing ever created...With purchase of this CD, you have the rare opportunity to experience MIDI bass and MIDI drums on EVERY SINGLE TRACK.The guitar is the only legitimate instrument but the tone is so incredibly horrendous it makes you think the guy who wrote the ""saved by the bell: the college years"" theme song has actually made his own album.Whomever this guy is, he's done a great disservice to the human race.I made this mistake of buying this CD and actually kept it. It became the laughing stock of me and my friends. If your looking for a great prank, pick it up."
4,Good Tea at an excellent price,"Tea was received promptly and in good condition, it has an excellent use by date, so I expectit to be drinkable for some time to come. We are Tea drinkers and buy many different teas; this is not the best Darjeeling we ever bought, but better than most."
5,Love this product,"I am a huge fan of the subtle and wonderful flavor of Darjeeling tea by Twinings. i have been trying to figure out whether it has caffeine in it, but I love this product. Its very subtle flavor wise, so if you are looking for a strong black tea this is definitely mild, but it is perfect for me!"
5,Fantastic,"Great tasting tea, great price, no shipping and no tax. What more could one ask for? Any tea connoisseur will be sure to enjoy."
5,Darjeling,This is one of my favorite flavors of tea and I am so pleased with being able to get it. Shipping was prompt and it arrived as scheduled
1,"""Perfumy""","In fact I can't bring myself to drink this tea (and I ordered the six pack).It has a - as best I can describe - perfumy taste. It's quite noticeable and rather odd.I am so disappointed. I had no idea that one major brand Darjeeling wasn't like any other.I much prefer Bigelow (which is the brand bought at my work, and by which I discovered I liked Darjeeling tea at all...).Bigelow Darjeeling Blend Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
2,Didn't like it,"Quite personally, I didn't like it. For me, it had no flavour at all. It only tasted better when I added some nutmeg (ran out of cinnamon) and milk. On the brightside, it did help me get rid of my cold :')"
5,"Darjeeling tea, drink of the emperors.",Searched high and low for darjeeling tea where I normally shop. They carry all types of Twinings tea except darjeeling tea.It has become my favorite tea since the purchase. It is flavorful with a hint of citrus. It has a clean and bright taste. I'm more than pleased with my purchase.J
5,Great,Now I dont break my toes when the table is not up. You will have to cut a hole in the floor if there is not one there already.
4,good economical nailer,"This nailer is great for non-contractor tasks. I bought it for installing ""trim work"" and it has saved considerable time. I would definitely buy it again."
5,More than 5 stars like 100,"I really love his music every CD is totally wonderful. I now have them all. This one is cool very punkish and new waveish which is what I grew up with in LA, Ca. What a voice and music-Thank You!"
4,Do not pass up Chris Isaak's debut album!,"Haunting, is the best way to describe this album, which includes songs like ""Voodoo"" and ""Funeral in the Rain"". Chris Isaak's first cd is among his best. His ballads are so damn pretty that you find your eyes welling up with tears; Tunes such as ""Dancin'"" and ""Living For Your Lover"" have you unconsciously tapping yout toes. It is a remarkable debut album from a remarkable, and at times, underrated, artist."
4,Sing down like silver(tone),"Chris Isaak made one of the most unlikely debuts of 1985. Crooning like Roy Orbison, coming on like a young Elvis Presely and getting a tremendous buzz from his incredible stage shows, Isaak set the wayback machine into motion like no-one since Brian Setzer. The album was so unique that several of these songs found their way into movie soundtracks (""Dancin',"" ""Gone Riding"" and ""Funeral In The Rain""). It wasn't just Isaak's movie idol looks that got him these choice slots, his music is very evocative. James Calvin Wilsey's guitar and pedal steel frequently adds a Sun Records/Country feel to the songs, which Isaak's high lonesome croon compliments.While this is not Isaak's best (it is closer to 3 1/2 stars, really), ""SILVERTONE"" lays out the template for his career to come."
3,Origin of the sound,"I really like Chris Isaak and have everything he has made. But, everyone of his albums sounds alike. This is his first album. Besides his classic song, Dancing, there is nothing here that stands out from all of his other albums. This is basically the origins of his sound that he refines and builds upon in later albums.People who have followed him from the beginning may consider this to be his ultimate album because everything later is just a variation of the original. But, if you listen to the later albums and then come back to this one, you may find that the first album is a little bland and is just the seed for better subsequent material."
5,Great practice DVD,"I have a 5 year old in kindergarten that I wanted to make sure that she was learning what she is supposed to during this first year of schooling. It's amazing how the use of sight words and phonics can get a child reading in no time. I just love hearing my kid sound out the letters in a word and then correctly identifying a word.As a bonus, my 2 year old LOVES to watch this movie with her sister. Maybe I'll get her reading before she starts Kindergarten."
5,great product!,"This video is great. My daughter started to watch this when she was one year old and now already knows all her letters and her letter sounds at just one and a half years old. She also enjoys watching this video. She is already sounding out words when she reads. Great product, I haven't found any other phonics videos out there that I like better than this one."
5,Awesome!,"Totally awesome DVD! My toddler loves to watch it and can even sing the vowel song now! Aeiou and sometimes y.... I love preschool prep products! My son learned his shapes, colors and alphabets by watching these amazing videos too, so I figured why not move on to letter sounds! It's so great! Keeps him busy while he learns... I just reinforce his learning by reviewing and singing the songs with him!"
5,Great product,This DVD is a very useful tool to help your children to learn.My 3 and 5 year old girls love watching them.5 stars from me!
5,Amazing,"I bought this for my 3 (almost 4) year old. He had been doing the sight word videos for a while and seemed to have them down so I thought I'd try something new. I watched this video with him several times and didn't think it was as effective as the sight word videos...I was very wrong. Before going to bed at night we read books, and I'll tell him to sound out the words and try to read with me. He is able to sound each letter out, and then put it together to say the word. It is amazing.This video and the sight word videos are awesome."
1,Junk - Save your money,"While I'm not the smartest woodworker on the block, I'd expected better of this tool. After about 2 passes trimming laminate edging, the blades became so dull that it wouldn't work anymore. Yes, you can turn it over and use the other side and the same thing will happen. If it were possible to give 0 stars, I would. Save your money."
4,Vuono's arrangements make these songs sparkle,"This compilation of Rob Vuono's arrangements brings new life to these songs, and Sue Matthews vocals fit perfectly. It's wonderful to hear what this talented arranger can do! I especially enjoyed 'That Old Black Magic' and 'Old Devil Moon.' The sequence flowed very nicely. It's also good to see Rob performing under his own, real name. One suggestion: Rob himself should have performed vocals...and played his trumpet on at least a couple of the songs--it would have made this recording even better!"
4,Mayhem Without Mercy,"This is the concert that originally appeared on The 7th Date of Hell video live at the Hammersmith Odeon 1984. Also 7 Gates of Hell, Countess Bathory and Welcome to Hell appeared on the American Assault ep. Warhead appeared on the Scandanavian Assault ep. Die Hard and In Nomine Satanas appeared on the Canadian Assault ep. Buried Alive appeared on the German Assault ep. So if you are looking for rare Venom live tracks this is a good place to start."
1,gold versus platinum?,"I used the NTI cd maker gold for some time and all I have to say is that it created more problems than burns. I found especially annoying the ""smart choice"" option that the software prompts you to everytime you try to burn a media: the program asks you (in practice forces you most of the times) to 'burn' to a temporary file on the HD instead of performing a physical burn if your data are less than the media (CD/DVD) size (ie burn 1Gb data on a DVD ended into 1Gb of HD space and a blank media). I am probably too dumb to avoid this ""smart choices"" or to tampering around the few setting options to avoid them. So you may end up with a blank media, being also asked to create a label for it(how dumb is that?!?), wasted time and HD space. if this is the NTI ""Gold"", it didn't convince me to buy the NTI Platinum. I got the roxio easycd/dvd creator and tada, my burned dvd."
4,Really Rocking!,This is a great introduction album for anyone wondering just who in the hell these guys are! I love this album and have since it came out in '87. It is still fresh and exciting.
5,Works,"My dentist recommended one of these because my gums were a tad inflamed, it is not pleasant felling but has improved my gum health."
5,Just as I expected only faster,This item arrived from the seller super fast and exactly as I thought they would be. I will be using this gum stimulator to work polyclay. They work great around the eye area of OOAK dolls. Will definatly buy from this seller again. They have a large selection of items. I highly recommend them.
1,Trite plot line and bad acting,"This has got to be one of the worst movies since ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" In fact, Ed Corbin's frozen face throughout the movie made me think he would be great in a remake of Plan 9. I had a hard time deciding what was worse, the ridiculous plot or the bad acting. In the end it's a toss up. Save your money."
4,Fresh New Telling of an Old Story,"A charming bittersweet rendering of an old 'man meets younger man but has to save him from himself first' tale. An Atlanta detective (a confirmed loner) assigned to undercover vice work has sex with, instead of arresting, a hustler in a gay bar.The hustler is falsly accused of killing one of his regular tricks, and the detective provides him with an alibi and a place to stay.Along the way, a relationship blossoms, followed by love. There are some fairly predictable plot twists, and more than a little bit of fairly wooden acting. However, the two principal characters are well cast and do a very good job.The underbelly of Atlanta looks believably seedy."
2,At the Angelika......NOT!,"This film has a few interesting scenes, but it has some mighty silly ones, too. The gentleman who plays the cop seems destined for the next Hercules cycle. Mugs mostly. At the beginning of the film, he seems to disdain the thought of gay sex. He sure does change his tune in a hurry, and without much fanfare. Oh, and the mystery aspect? The buddy did it. That's certainly original.The little guy who plays the hustler holds his own. Not much character development in the film, so he has to wing it. Does a decent job. Can't recommend the film, though."
1,I am sorry but it's sooo bad,"I have not seen a bad movie for a long time, this is really bad. I can take film with slow pace, low budget, most of them (may be because I am very selective) turn out to be very good. But this one ... oh, may be I should quote the cop inside the film : ""not my type."""
4,A unique gay thriller with a great script and cast!,"Every once in a while comes a great little gem of a film. This can easily be said for ""In The Flesh"". Directed by Ben Taylor and starring Dane Ritter as the cute but not so innocent hustler, this hits right at home for ALL viewers straight or gay. Ed Corbin stars as a vice cop that is hesitant to take a case involving drug traffic in a gritty gay bar. There he befriends Dane Ritter the hustler and the two fall in love. Suddenly both are plunged into a nightmarish hell when a murder is committed and the cop risks his job for his new found lover insisting he is innocent of the crime. Soon the hustler becomes the hustled when he becomes the target of a murderer. What remains is the two attempting to stay alive amid corruption and greed in a seedy suburb of Atlanta. Still we are left with the question for money or love? Pay close attention to the bar,....but if youv'e been to or live in Atlanta you probably know that already."
3,Better than I thought it would be,"I started watching this movie with low expectations. I have seen so many gay-themed, low budget films that have been a waste of time and was worried that this would be just another one. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and that I enjoyed this film. It has kind of an overall dark flavor and, at times, the characters seem a bit unreal but overall, their performances are believable.Oliver Beck, the main character, is the best part of the movie. I loved his relationship with his sister, tragic though it was. I also enjoyed the way he begins to let his guard down with Phillip over the course of the film.The ending of the movie was the hardest part to watch, as it seemed the most artificial and staged.Overall, I would ""borrow"" or rent this film if possible. I believe it is worth watching but not owning (even though I bought it)."
2,Sometimes things don&#65533;t seem to be,"From the advertisement, In The Flesh really looks cute, almost sensual. But it's a big disappointment for me. It's a story about a male hustler and a cop, they fall in love, solve a case, and live happily ever after. Well, it really sounds wonderful, but with the whole script and screenplay like that, their acting wouldn't be better whatsoever. It's well-intentioned, but a big disappointment."
5,"A good, solid murder mystery.","An Atlanta police officer assigned to a unit formed to crack down on prostitution meets a hooker who strikes a cord of sympathy in him, despite the hooker's possible involvement in a sordid murder. Still hurting from a failed relationship, he resists his attraction, but is drawn unrelentingly toward a bond with his foe.Back in the grimy world of prostitution, the crime turns more revolting and even some cops take on a decidedly sinister look. Who is trying to kill the hooker? Or is Corbin the intended victim?The solution comes as a surprise, but no more surprising that the hooker's periodic disappearances with food and supplies and the person for whom they are destined.Dane Ritter, the hooker, and Ed Corbin the cop are handsome guys, each of whom has the qualities that the other desperately needs, but is one a killer?"
4,"watch it ,you'll know","I didn't know this film is about a gay love. I just took it from my friend.It's an old dvd, no covery, no intruduce,I think this must be a good police movie, but when I watch it , I dispoint.I callmy friend, he told me just watch it, ok, I did.I went on watch it.Slowly, I find it a good film about gay love.I can't belive a gay movie can be so good. The acting of all the actors is good, in the 102 minites, we get into two mens heart.In the film, I frist to close the gays.Whatever i say, you just need to watch it, tell us your feeling."
3,Good movie and great music!,This is a long overdue development of a relationship between two men with all their accompanying past histories. The storyline is good and the student/streethustler character intriguing. The late night scenes of Atlanta alone are worth viewing. Now to the music. Does anyone know how to purchase the songs from the track? I own the movie and would like to have the songs.
3,EARNEST AND WELL-INTENTIONED,"The plot screams ""exploitation!"" -- a vice-squad cop falls in love with a male hustler -- but the resulting film is subdued and even thoughtful. (Perhaps too much so. There's virtually no sex in the movie even though it's a sexual attraction that first bonds the unlikely pair.) The movie, (filmed in Atlanta), has a professional look throughout and the acting is better than what you might expect with the best work coming from Dane Ritter as the bit-too-cleancut hustler. Ed Corbin can't do much with the not-always-plausible role as the cop but he has a nice set of buns."
4,The film and the music,"Yes, for Atlanta! and yes for a tender, honest, developingrelationsip with real problems between lovers! Could have used a bitmore intimacy... Also, after much research I found some of the musicbackgrounding this film. It can be attributed to Wes Yoakamsinger/songwriter. His songs were evidently found by Ben Taylor(producer) while this kid worked in a Athens,GA night spot called the40-Watt Club. He performed there occasionally and worked in the placepart-time while being a student. Sounds reminiscenat of thee film'scharacter Oliver. Anyway some of the songs are found on Amazon.com ina CD called ""Four Star Explosion""......I found out by wordof mouth around the Atlanta area about the music. Also, I found the CDon Amazon.com ... I now own both the DVD and the CD! Good luck infinding it for yourself."
2,"Poor Attempt at a Gay ""Thriller""","It's obvious the producers of this film wanted to create a steamy, psychological thriller in the genre of Basic Instinct or Nine 1/2 Weeks, only with a gay theme. Instead, we got a creepy, wooden movie that makes you wish there were more talented filmakers out there willing to work on gay-themed material. Skip this one -- hopefully something better will come along."
3,Under Water?,"While this film didn't really offer us anything new to this genre, it isn't a bad entry. The acting is a bit wooden at times, but the film moves quickly (despite being an hour and 45 minutes in length!) while tackling some serious subject matter.The reason I am adding a review deals with the quality of the DVD. The entire Pro Logic audio track sounds as if the film is under water. I needed to disable Pro Logic and play the film with just my two front speakers. Watch out for this. I do not recommend purchasing this DVD due to the poor sound quality, which doesn't restrict itself to just the movie. The extras on the DVD also suffer from this problem."
1,waste of time...,"""In the Flesh"" is not much more than an after-midnight B movie you would find on most low-brow cable channels. Upon first glance, the plot and cast look inviting. Let your intrigue stop there. Don't expect much of a storyline -- with absolutely nothing that you have not seen before... and done better.If you like the male hustler genre, you may enjoy this flick. If not, the only reason I would suggest this movie is if you are having trouble falling asleep and the warm milk just isn't helping."
3,Thompson NASB Study Bible,"This is my second Thompson chain study Bible. My other one is a NKJV. I thought they would be essentially the same, but they are not. The NKJV has more subheadings and all of the OT references are footnoted, whereas the NASB does not. Also, I was not aware that the NASB version I purchased was not the 1995 update. Maybe that is why the price was so good. Finally, although the box it came in clearly said NASB Study Bible, the study Bible notation appears nowhere in the Bible itself. Not sure I would buy it if I had to do it all over again."
2,Set it free!,"The Albion Band is an institution - more a laboratory than an actual ""band"" in the traditional sense. Constantly shuffling new blood into ever-changing line-ups, Ashley Hutchings' experiments are usually most rewarding when they produce material with a timeless quality. The music ""captured"" here does not meet this criteria. Most of the original material seems very dated with a late 80's / early 90s studio slickness prevalent when these line-ups recorded them. There have been some very sucessful Albion line-ups before and since this period. Look elsewhere."
2,Overrated,"If you like a Siskel & Ebert approach to network security monitoring, this is your book. It's just a review of open source tools with nothing innovative or new added except for unnecessary militarization of a few concepts."
5,Great Show,If you are a fan of the show you will be happy with this DVD set. It is better than expected and it is at a great price.
5,Peta Wilson is HOT!,"I have been waiting so long for the 3rd season to be released on DVD since I originally saw the series on cable TV. The 3rd season is awesome, incredible, and poetic. Yes, poetic. Every human interaction and piece of dialogue in each show of the La Femme Nikita has so much layers of meaning. The first layer is what you see, which is just an illusion. The second level is the the layer of lies as each character jockeys for position and power and survival. The 3rd level is the ""truth,"" or what we think is the truth. As you see more and more shows, especially the 4th and short 5th season, you realize that there is a 4th level of truth, and nothing was ever what it seemed to be after all. Shakespeare would have been proud."
4,I'm hooked,The complete 3rd season. Still creative storytelling without repeating itself (too much). Technology is amazingly current and Nikita looks great.
5,Another great season,"This show had it all, action, intrigue, and romance. Even after 13 years it still beats all the other programs that are on the air now."
5,S. Marcelle,Absolutely love it! Anyone would enjoy having their own marathon of La Femme Nikita to sit back and watch all weekend. This was one of the best series on TV. The chemistry between Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis is hypnotic. I've never seen another one like it. I'm sorry the series lasted only 5 seasons.
1,Terrible packaging.,"La Femme Nikita, Season 3, I would rate at least 4 stars, however the box set I received from Amazon was in pieces. 2 of the 3 disc trays had come loose from the spine creating a totally unacceptable box set. As a result I am deducting 3 stars for the abysmal packaging which necessitated the purchase of a new case for storage."
3,Replacement purchase,"My season III of La Femme Nikita was deteriorating: freezing, breaking up, black stripes -- is that normal on 4 or 5 yr. old DVD's? These arrived in a broken case, the disc-holder pages detached. Disc quality good though, so I'm happy."
3,Visual quality very disappointing,"I've just pulled out my season two discs to compare them, and I'm really disappointed. This season's discs seem to be awfully over-compressed. There is a lot of clearly visible artifacting in any of the open spaces of light color in the background of shots (which are used a lot with white and silver expanses) all through this season. I've even been seeing distressing halos and shadows on faces writhing around when people move. The second season looked exquisite. This one definitely does not. For a show of this calibre (the very highest) and with such a focus on visual elements, that is a major flaw. I'm very disappointed."
5,Not Gone...And Not Forgotten!,"Scritti Politti's Cupid & Psyche '85 has been the most overlooked work of the 80's. Green Gartside's ability to craft catchy tunes never wavers throughout the album. Like most I first heard Perfect Way on the radio and thought, ""Where did THIS come from?"" And over a decade later, I still play this CD in my car weekly. I look forward to the new album coming in 1999. Enjoy!!"
3,When roller skating was cool,"3 1/2Behind breathy, ultra-plasticized production lies some of the 80's most intriguing sophisti-pop."
2,Time hasn't been kind to this one!,"Yeah, I, like the others, remember this disc fondly for the time that it was hot. Upon a ""revisit"", I can't see why it was a seller.And why, for the life of me, I bought it!"
4,"Clever, Catchy Pop.","The single ""Perfect Way"" was a welcome treat from the British group Scritti Politti. With crisp drums, snappy guitars and the blue-eyed soul of lead singer Green, it was a piece of smart pop that was accessible yet cleverly done. Much of the rest of their album ""Cupid and Psyche 85"" lives up to that promise. It's hard to resist the reggae lilt of ""The Word Girl,"" the catchy yet strange ""Wood Beez (Pray Like Aretha Franklin),"" and the light hearted funk of ""Work that Hard."" While American audeinces of the 1980s gravitated to makeup-clad hair metal bands and cheesy new wave acts, UK's Scritti Politti were a welcome breath of fresh air. Though not flawless, ""Cupid and Psyche"" is a welcome flashback to my adolescence in the 1980s."
5,Guilty pleasure? What's so guilty about pop?,"This is one of the first CD's I went out and bought after getting my 1st CD player; it's one I still play a whole lot. The contrast of great pop melodies with fantastically bombastic rhythm sections is something to sing along to in the car (provided you can mimic Green's falsetto). I just saw the listing for the new disc and am itching for a domestic release. Savage Garden are a cheap imitation of the 80's pop sound; if you want the real thing, Scritti Politti is the ""Perfect Way"" to get it."
5,Love this book,"I'm a huge nautical book fan, I've read from the Perfect Storm to Saved, I feel like I'm right there with them and can't believe all the mishaps and the outcome."
4,a good book,"Most books I have read on the subject seem to be simply a collection of algorithmic tricks and techniques. There's no single universal idea, except for this book by Udi Manber. The cover picture says it all. In my opinion, the most fundamental and universal concept in algorithmic design is the idea of induction, recursion, and building bigger desired solutions from smaller already-constructed ones. The experts establish this as their intuition and perhaps take it for granted. But as a beginning algorist, when you have to ask yourself how do I solve/optimize/approximate this problem, I think you'll find this idea so important. This book attempts to make this concept your algorithmic intuition, and that's I think is a good thing.That said, it should be read along with other books in algorithms design and analysis."
5,The best book on algorithm design I have seen,"If you really want to learn to design algorithms, get this book.This book is the only book I know of that teaches you how to design new algorithms. Unlike other algorithms bibles like CLR, this book does not focus on the details behind the proof of correctness but on the ideas that lead to the creation of algorithms.If you want to succeed in programming contests like Topcoder SRM, ACM ICPC and other similar contests, get this book! If you want to crack every problem on your next programming interview for a large software company, read this book (and implement the solutions in the language of your choice, like JAVA and C++).This book really deserves to have a second edition and it should be the standard text for all algorithms courses!"
2,"Covers a lot, but bigger aint always better","Although this book covers a large area its coverage is somewhat incomplete. The first thing you notice is the bad formatting of this book making the examples and explanations hard to follow. Mathematical proofs and algorithms are placed, bit by bit, into a paragraph of text i.e.""...When we substitute -x for x in (9.8), we get P(-x)=Pe(x^2)+(-x)Po(x^2). To evaluate (9.7), we need to compute P(x-i) and P(-xi), for 0<i<n/2. To do that..."" --Udi Manber, Intro to AlgorithmsThis combined with the assumption that the reader already understands the subject and the maths behind it makes it an unsuitable introductory text. Its only redeeming feature is its wide range of topics, if this is the only Algorithmics book you are likely to by at this time look elsewhere, if you need a second or third book to clarify some points this may just be the one you are after."
5,Built Well and Simple to Use,"I just needed a way to hold and payout 50 feet of extension cord at work. I was expecting something much more cheaply made. The handle is beefy, the mechanism is extremely smooth and the overall design is very good. I'm definitely buying one for home."
4,Satisfied,I actually bought this to try to wind up my air hose. However you would have to have a much shorter air hose than I had to fit. I ended up using it for a 10ga extension cord and it has worked great. You do have to help it feed in by moving cord up and down as you wind so it won't all bunch up at the bottom.
3,it's okay,"I bought this as I needed for an extension cord for my electric snow thrower and wanted to make sure that the cord was easy to unwind and wind. Well the unwind feature is great just give it a tug, but if you have a thick electrical cord then it is not as easy to wind and you may want to reconsider this. I am going to keep it because I do like the bucket feature, just wish the bucket was a bit bigger to accomodate thicker cords. What I do have to say in a positive note is that I ordered this yesterday am and it arrived before noon today!"
5,Expensive but works great,"I use a 100' 12 awg extension cord to mow my lawn, and I wanted a simple, quick way to store my cord. This item was expensive, but from the reviews, I thought it would be worth a try. I'm glad I did. While I do think $40+ is almost more than I am willing to pay to store a cord, it saves me a lot of time, effort, and helps me keep my garage organized."
5,I love it - Just buy it,"I bought this to wind up a heavy duty cord and I works great, No Problems at all. Once I tried it, I bought 3 more. However my work payed for it."
3,Price hike! Yikes!,"Yeah, I hear you Judy when it comes to the price shooting up [...]. I have been looking at this item myself for the last 6 weeks or so and finally decided I was going to buy it after dealing with my 100 foot 12 gauge electrical cord the last few weeks blowing leaves (with an electric leaf blower). To my shock, the price went up about $30. Thankfully, I found this Quick Winder RAP-100 online with shipping for about the same price as I would have got it before thru Amazon. I might come back and add to this review after I've used it a bit even though I am not buying it from Amazon."
5,The Best,"I bought a cheap, repeat cheap Bayco, and it was the one of the worst items I've ever spent money on. It's in my trash pile waiting to go to the dump. This cord winder however is absolutely one of the best items I've spent money on. I was a little leery at first to get this, because of being burned the first time, but I'm sooo happy I took the chance. This thing works like a charm, and will NOT be going in the trash. Yes, it is more expensive, but at least it works, and works great."
5,Winds the cord quickly and easily,I bought this power cord holder after I saw it in one of those airplane mall magazines. I bought a heavy duty 100' cord and this bucket easily holds it. It is made of sturdy plastic. The only problem is that the bucket moves around when I am winding the cord. I solved this problem by just stepping on the corners with my feet. This is a great gadget.
4,Pretty good for the cost,"I've made spaetzle several times with this little maker, and it works relatively well. The only shape noodles you can make are the very tiny ones (no real length to them), but what else can I expect for the price? Overall, I'm pleased."
5,spaetzle maker,The best spaetzle maker I have run across. It's very easy to use and durable/ I can highly recommend this product.
5,Easy and impressive.,"It is hard to beleive, but this thing does what it promisses to do - easily and with infinite variations. And you probably do not need more sofisticated and much more expensive makers. It is well made and very easy to clean. And a lot of fun!"
5,DREAM TOOL,"This spaetzle maker works like a dream and produces professional looking spaetzle. Follow the fabulous recipe made with milk that they offer on the package as it is truly fantastic. If you make spaetzle, you CANNOT be without this tool."
5,buy this if you like spaetzle!,It works perfectly and eliminated the drudgery of hand cutting the individual pieces. Easy to clean up for the next use. I like it so much i bought one for my mother. Don't listen to the reviews that say it is flimsy. It is well constructed and will last for years of use.
5,does the job,"It's a pretty simple appliance, it sure does make spaetzle. I've used the recipie included several times and it comes out pretty darned good. It's a little pain to clean, but that goes with the territory when working with spaetzle batter. Lots of watter and soaking and it is fine."
5,Spaetzle,I made Spaezle many times in my life. I work as a chef and I used it in the Restaurant. You can make Spaetzle fast and they looked nice.Great product!
3,Okay for the price,"This is a great introduction to making spaetzle, to see if you enjoy the dish and making it. However, I used mine three or four times before the plastic melted at the point it meets the grate. It buckled and eventually no longer stayed attached to the plate. I will definitely be replacing it with a metal-handled product - I was wearing a kitchen mitt anyway since your hands are over boiling water, so having a cool handle is a non-issue. I'm glad I bought this less-expensive one to try out, but wish it had lasted a little longer."
2,not well made,"very hard to clean, and worse, the handle shrank (i don't understand how but it did) and fell off while I was making a batch of spaetzle, so the whole thing fell into the boiling water. Yuck."
5,Spatzle Maker from Amazon.com,The spatzle maker works great. It was delivered faster than expected.Immediate service and delivery. Extremely satisfied with this product.It came with instructions and a recipe.
5,Great spaetzle!,This year our annual August meeting we had an October Fest. I made the spaetzel. I ordered this maker and it did an excellent job. I even used the recipe on the back and it was great!
4,EMERIL USED THIS TOOL ON HIS SHOW!!!!!,"I saw Emeril Lagasse use this spaetzle maker and I knew I needed it immediately. My mom used to make spaetzle and drop the dumplings by hand into the boiling beef stew and it was so time consuming but we loved to eat them. It was worth the wait. But alas, this tool doesn't make spaetzle as big as my mom's but the receipe that is included with this tool is just as good. I had fun using it and plan to order 2 more as Christmas presents."
5,Easy as pie to make genuine spaetzle,"My spaetzle maker arrived today, so I decided to break it in right away. I had already defrosted a pork tenderloin, so browned it with mushrooms and onions, made a gravy and then made the spaetzle. It turned out beautifully and tasted just like I remember my mom's tasting when I was growing up and she (who's from Germany) would make it. Yummy! I used the one recipe that came on the box and it was yummy. I reduced the recipe by 1/3 and it was perfect for a family a four, with not a noodle left! I plan to buy one for my daughter-in-law for Christmas."
3,Messy but functional,"This spatzel maker works, but the plastic box allows the dough to come out the sides making a mess. I never had that problem with my all metal one. Other than that though, it functions as advertised. The spatzel was still yummy."
5,spaetzle maker,This product arrived in perfect condition and within 2 days. It works great and is easy to use. It even had recipes with it. We have had a lot of fun making homemade spaetle.
