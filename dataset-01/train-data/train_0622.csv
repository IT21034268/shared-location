1,Poor Value-- Lacks Analysis,"This book was POORLY written. I am an authority on the issues- and there was no analysis. The so-called ""book"" simply represents the rantings of a nationalist. On page 193 of his book, he even *advocates*: ""...MAKING USE OF [Chinese]NATIONALISTIC EMOTIONS TO CARRY OUT AN IDEOLOGICAL WAR AGAINST THE U.S.A."" Why should I bother to critique this book? I believe his statements speak VOLUMES...he's done the work for me.Out of the 240 pages in this book, only about 80 of the pages contain written material, the rest are appendicies, footnotes and the writing trips and falls over itself into half-baked, obscure and unintelligible oblivion.I love China and its people and its culture, so this book truly saddens me."
3,never purchased this text,"i think that maybe we enquired about this text, but we never purchased as it is a teacher's edition. thanks."
3,JD club-2008,Ths club looks like the original JD I have but seems to lack something that causes it not to propel the ball as did my earlier version. I just do not get the distance or feel I had hoped for.
5,Excellent Tool for Any Researcher of Library Patron,"Outstanding work with clear illustrations and examples of how to improve your library research. I learned more about library research in this book than in all my years pursuing a doctorate degree.A MUST have for anyone who spends time in the library. You do not have to be a professional researcher or academician to get useful tools from this book. My kids have read the book as well, and their research projects for school improved dramatically.I strongly recommend this book is you plan any research projects in the future."
4,Kindle Edition,"This is a very useful book, and one that we use at our college in our for-credit library instruction courses. Just be advised, the Kindle version is a copy of the first edition and the most recent publication in print is the third edition."
5,Indispensible for Academics,"Mann's book rewards a careful reader with an exposition of how the organization of libraries and databases serve the needs of the researcher - nothing in a library's organization is arbitrary, and this volume carefully explains how to best use that organization for deep research. He teaches useful, high-level techniques with interesting and memorable examples. This can be useful for an undergraduate research course, but it's entirely indispensable for serious academic work. Anyone starting a graduate or doctoral program should read this, as well as anyone looking for more ""tips and tricks.""I am an academic library paraprofessional, and I regularly teach research practices to undergraduates, graduates, and teaching faculty."
1,WHY IS THIS SO HARD,I went to check this out at my library.Couldn't find it ANYWHERE. I looked under the chair. I looked on the roof. I rolled around on the ground for like ten or fifteen minutes. NOTHING HELPED. I'm JUST MAD.
5,HIS BEST - BETTER THAN THE GREATEST HITS,...because for whatever lame reason the song Tell Me I'm Not Dreamin' is not on any of the hit collections. It is a phenominal duet with Michael and is as good if not better than Dynamite which is also on here. This is the best Jermaine Jackson album ever. It's a shame that in the states the only Tell Me I'm Not Dreamin' available is the late Robert Palmer's cover version.
2,OH MY GOD!!,"Jermaine, Jermaine, Jermaine...What the hell were you smokin' when you made this album? What made you decide that Escape From The Planet Of the Ant Men should be on the album? I couldn't stop laughing at this song for nothing. I mean the sound effects and all were just funny. I gave it two stars because there were only a few songs that I knew and loved. Otherwise, this album is just incredibly stupid. Love the Jackson clan very much though."
5,"GREAT 'find""","Had bunion surgery in May and Doc told me... ""...NO more heels... NO tight shoes... wear a shoe which cradles your foot... NOT binds it..."" So... these Arizona Birkies are just what the Doc ordered. The pleasure is in the walking!!! Too bad I cannot use their cost as a medical deduction!"
2,Sizing was way off,"I have several pairs of Birkenstocks, size 39. I ordered these in size 39, and when they came they were HUGE! I returned them, thinking that I must have ordered a men's shoe or something by mistake, but according to the size chart the sizing is the same for all Birkenstocks. I don't understand why the shoes were three inches too long, and I'm pissed that I had to pay eight dollars of shipping charges to return them. I still want the shoes, but am now too afraid to order them off of Amazon."
5,BT,"I saw this movie and it was horrible, but the spell of the plot kept you watching no matter how much you wanted to turn. they have picked a perfect title for this movie because one glimpse of this flick, you are hooked. The movie, itself is only two stars,but the way they keep you in the movie gives it a five."
1,So horrible it's funny,"I saw this movie late at night at a friend's house. Imagine every single stereotype about drugs you've ever heard wrapped up into a low-budget flick. This is that movie. It's so bad it's hillarious. The lingo is great, too. This movie has great kitsch value, and would be a great thing to watch while you're sitting around with your friends, smoking a blunt or drinking. It's definitely entertaining, but only because it's so bad."
1,im sorry i read this,"quite literally, cathy hopkins writes some of the worst books i have ever read. not only was this book (and its sequel) painful to finish, they are hugely unimaginative. you would find NOTHING in here that you haven't already read in a hundred other teenage novels. don't waste your money. if you really have to read this, go to the library. you'll thank me."
2,"Good premise, but no delivery.","Having read the Louise Rennison books (Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging, etc.) I was all set for more hilarity. But other than obvious plot devices and jokes pulled directly from Rennison, it was just a non-entity.Lucy is a 14-year-old girl and does not know what to do with her life (the question was asked as part of a school assignment). She is flat-chested, has hippies for parents (or so she says), and is facing the whole boy scene.As in Rennison's books, she falls for a guy who thinks she might be two young, takes kissing lessons from a guy, even admits to making hammocks our of sanitary pads. Unlike Rennison, the story is told in a first-person narrative and not a diary. Lucy's life is not really crazy enough (or at all) for real laughs and comes out as overall bland.If you are looking for a book that will have you laughing out loud, this is not the one. Even without reading Rennison first, this one just won't deliver."
3,A Plane Read,"It is not as though I did not enjoy the book, it is just that I did not find it as funny as the Louise Rennison novels (Georgia Nicolson series). I read this book about two months after finishing the 4th Georgia Nicolson book and although I found this book amusing, I did not laugh out loud as I did with the Georgia Nicolson books. I thought that the teenage references were too cliche, and the author did not convince me to believe that this book was being written by a teenager. I recommend this book as a summer vacation read or plane-ride read, and for the preteen/young teen age group. Although I didn't love the first book I do intend on reading the rest of the books in the series."
2,It was alright,"This book was cute, i suppose. It made for light reading (I read it all on a 6 hour plane ride), but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. The author seemed out of touch. She just threw in what she had seen about teenagers from her Businessweek. There were Leonardo DiCaprio and Spice Girl comments, like that's all teens know and love. It was cute, but I dont plan on reading the sequels."
1,dont bother,"when i first saw this book i thought... o cool.. this looks pretty good... i read the back of it and it seemed ok 2 me so i bought it. i started reading it and about 5 minutes into it i put it down in favor of another book.a book this small would usually take me about an hour to finish maybe 2... tops. but instead it took me about 2 weeks and i didnt even read it all!i flipped around 2 try and find the good parts... but there were none.it ended up getting shoved under my bed and i forgot aboutit. i say dont waste your money on this searies. i would suggest reading the confessions of gorgia niclocon or gossip girl. or if you dont want 2 read a searies then try gingerbread, hanging on to max, or shattering glass."
2,Not very good,"It was just a bad story line. She is a good writer, just not a good thinker. There isnt much going on it the book. It is almost like she tried to take the idea of Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging, and make it her own, but not sucessfully. Dont buy thiws book unless you are really really bord."
3,Good read,"This is a great book that is perfect for teenage readers-- especially 14 year olds (the main character is 14.) Lucy tells all about her typical teenage life that includes, friends, guys, appearances, family, and inflatable bras. It's written very well. The only draw back is that it is way too short. Luckily, the author has written other books in the sequel to make up for the length. Good read-- try it!"
4,Does anyone know any good Dead Baby jokes?,"Old Kai's plan to free everyone from Baby's control has worked. Now Gohan, Trunks, and Goten want revenge. Goku urges them to reconsider. They don't have enough power to defeat them on their own. The only way to get the job done is to give Goku their power and let him finish the job."
3,SO AND SO,Dr Goswami is certainly very knowledgable in qauantum physics and methaphysical subjects. I wish I could sit and listen to him and I can do it whole day.But I'm very disappointed with the DV quality and presentation. Looks like a home video by Dr. Goswami's students.
2,Pseudo physics,"I thought it was interesting in the beginning, until I realized this wasn't science at all (just because you call it science, doesn't make it science)"
4,Excellent,"Don't buy the hype that the atheist-materialist clowns are trying to sell you in their overpriced books. As this film illustrates, they're stuck in denial, clinging to the desperately out-of-date classical-scientific worldview that modern quantum physicists like Goswami have now overturned. A must see, for people of any (or no) spiritual beliefs."
4,An interesting but dense movie,"This movie was first recommended to me by a good friend. The doctor interviewed, has some very interesting ideas. It is good to see where science is on how the universe/our individual world works. You will need to watch this movie many times in order to get some understanding. It should come with a workbook or book of definitions. Worth the watching."
5,Food for thought in science and spirituality,"If you are hungry for new ways of looking at how science and spirituality intersect and provide for a new way of looking at our world, check out this DVD. I love this guy. I would describe Amit Goswami as a quantum physicist who is also a deep, enlightened, spiritual thinker. For anyone devoted to looking at the world beyond the gross materialistic view there is a benefit. We have shown this DVD 3 times to 3 different groups of friends and they all got something valuable from it. This DVD will not only help you to understand innovations in quantum physics but will also show you how to fine tune your spiritual practices for the betterment of humanity. If you like this DVD and are interested in science and spirituality and how they intersect I would also recommend, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy. Her book takes up many of the points articulated in ""The Quantum Activist"" from a Christian standpoint."
1,What did he just say?,"Before writing this review, I noticed that this 'documentary' has 4 stars here on Amazon Instant...Face. Palm. Wow, this was so mind-bendingly awful that I could not get more than half way. The ideas this guy espouses are really nothing anyone hasn't said before or anything you couldnt come up with yourself given a six-pack, a box of crayons, and a philosophy 101 class. As a philosophy major myself, there wasn't anything he said that I couldn't immediately refute. A message of hope based on lies leaves you with no hope at all. This 'documentary' is what happens when scientists try to philosophize. Don't quit your day job, pal."
4,Worthy addition,"This addition to the field manual series is easily as good as the Draconis Combine book. A couple of things prevent a full 5 though. First, there's almost no information on the Mariskova(sp?) and there is a problem with the Marshall variant that supposedly uses the stealh armor(the problem being, in addition to not having stealth armor, it can't - not enough open crits due to ferro-fibrous and jump jets). The new tech is pretty extreme, but well balanced. Definitely a must buy."
3,Did NOT Fit Specified Gun,"I needed this holster for a Springfield XD 45 5-INCH. This holster was obviously not 'boned' using the correct model because the holster was not even close to being large enough for the gun. Bianchi/Safariland customer service was very friendly, however not very helpful. I have plenty of other Bianchi and Safariland products that are great, however this holster for my particular gun did not turn out so well. I give my individual purchase one star, however Bianchi/Safariland in general are pretty good, so I still want to leave a positive review."
1,Wrong Item,I was sent the wrong item. My order from Amazon was Cd's no LP'S I didnt even waste my time to send them back. Unhappy
1,Worst New Artist of the Decade,"""Lip Gloss"" is the most annoying, aggravating, ridiculously stupid song to hit the airwaves in 2007. I'd rather listen to snap music than garbage like this song.Lil Mama already comes off like an obnoxious, pretentious teenager (which she is) and she compounds that problem with a terrible song like ""Lip Gloss"". The hook is not impressive, the drums are wasted, and the lyrics defy explanation. 'My lip gloss is poppin. My lip gloss is cool'. Please tell me what the point of that is.And the arrogance of calling her self the 'voice of the young people' is particularly galling. If she's represents our current young people, then this world's in trouble."
4,A concise introduction,"Written by the best known authority on disciplinary discourse, it is written with little jargon, but with clarity and brevity. However, if you have read most of Ken's works, there is little new in this book."
5,This Video Has Been Released On DVD,"This is a review of this product:G.L.O.W. Vol. 2 - The Saga Continues VHS. Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply. After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assurred that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------This video has been releasedon DVD. The DVD is exactly the same as the VHS, although the picture is a bit darker, the audio was turned up a bit too loud, and there are faint picture rolls throughout that were not in the videotape. All minor video and audio defects in the original VHS release are carried over onto the DVD."
5,Great Group Game!,"If you are looking for a game to play with a group of friends, then this is the game for you! The bigger the group the better! I have to admit that there were a number of facts that I did not know but I was also impressed with some of the things I remembered from school. Purchase this game if you are looking for a great educational game!"
4,Educational,"This game allows players to think about the answers to gain the most chips to win the game. Its fun to see who answer first for the most chips to wager. Its an all around Fun game. There's only one draw back, theres so many chips it takes a long time to play the game. We have a way to get around that though, we just play with less chips."
1,Very Disappointing,"Not very much fun at all; bought it specifically for a dinner party I had for several couples and was rather embarrassed at how bad it was. It would be greatly improved if it had the correct answers for those questions that turn out to be crap, very anticlimactic.I even wrote the Imagination Co. to let them know what a let down the game was but never got a reply, that's why I decided to write this review.Don't waste your money, buy Pictionary by Haspro instead!"
2,Its not what I thought,"We played this game at a family get together yesterday. It was much too dry and boring for our family. We are all intelligent people, but found this game laboring along with hard to pronounce words and obscure subjects. I guess if you enjoy slow moving trivia games, this would be for you."
2,Not great,"Our family is disappointed in this game. The game would be much more fun and interesting--and actually educational--if the creators included the correct answers to the questions that are ""crap"" (false) and elaborated with additional interesting facts on the answers that are ""fact"".Our family would not buy this game again."
5,Easy to play; requires no special knowledge,"The game is easy to play: you read what is written on the card and the other people put down a Fact or a Crap voting card (face down, of course). Those who are correct take a token; those who are wrong pay a token. The first person to put down their vote card takes or pays two tokens. If you don't know the answer (which is likely), you just guess. You play until all the tokens in the center are gone. It is a great game for all ages. My mother-in-law asked to play it on Mother's day (she's in her upper-70s). Our son is college age and will play it with us when our friends are over or with his friends."
1,uhhhh... are they all crap?,"This game has 2 kinds of question cards: the regular question cards and ""Rush Hour Bonus Round"" cards. It took us only 5 minutes of play to realize that all 5 of the answers on EVERY ""Rush Hour Bonus Round"" card was crap. It got to the point where you'd start asking the Rush Hour questions and the person being asked would just say ""crap"" 5 times - without waiting to hear the questions. We finally took those cards out - which was REALLY disappointing because they could be fun. What's the point of playing a game when all of the answers are the same? I wish we had chosen to purchase a different game. DISAPPOINTED!"
5,Fun game for all!,This is a great game for small dinner parties or family night. Good laughs to be had by all...and you learn off the wall trivia.
1,A Fact It's CRAP!,"Every single Rush Hour card all had the the ""crap"" answer so after about the third one, everyone just said ""crap"" and was right. How STUPID is that?"
4,Birds Love This,I bought 2 of these bell treats. It's made mostly of sunflower seeds and nearly all species of birds love it. I've looked in pet stores and the seed bells there are all broken up. This arrived in nearly perfect condition. Very pleased with this product.
3,You got to be tough...,"On paper, this mouthwash is just what I seek: a mouthwash with Xylitol (to starve bacteria) AND alcohol (to kill bacteria). Unfortunately, I find this stuff too minty-strong to use regularly.If you like a powerful mint, this may be perfect for you."
5,Memories of days lost and gone,"I am fascinated by this company, Pacific Electric, its story and the service it brought to many people. This movie tells the story about the ups and downs, the battle for control over the company, the lack of interest in preserving the service it brought people, and the fascinating and very telling story about how business suffered after the streetcars/interurbans was replaced by buses."
5,Serious Seeker's Guide,"I am awed by the depth of this book.This is a book for the serious seeker.It presents the traditional thinking from the Torah, Midrashim and Talmud,but it has the added spiritual dimension which has become so important in our contemporary Jewish life.The author takes us through the day from dawn to dusk,through the three paths of Judaism,Torah study,prayer and the path of loving kindness.giving us the traditional laws and customs for each of these and also the method by which to enhance these practices.He does the same for the holidays and also the Jewish life cycle.Just as Strassfeld's editorship of the Jewish Catalogues,met the needs of the Jewish people of the seventiles.""A Book of Life"
4,A deep study of Jewish Practice,"Rabbi Michael Strassfeld, of the Jewish catalog fame, provides an encyclopedic look at Jewish practice and thought from nearly every angle in this work. Perhaps the best feature of this book is Strassfeld's look at the human life cycle through the lens of the books of the Torah. Judaism is supposed to be all-embracing for those who take her on, and Strassfeld provides a humble and practical way to do that, all within the tradition of Jewish renewal and liberal thought."
3,Not As Described,"This shipment came in on time and in good condition. But it wasn't the extended illustrated edition with the extra pages as described on the Amazon website. One would think that since the link is made directly from the description, that the supplier would be issuing it exactly as described. However, I am happy to have any copy of this title that I could get. It isn't readily available."
3,NO INDEX!!!!,"I have to admit I haven't read the book yet. I know it got a RAVE starred review in Publisher's Weekly, so I ordered it right away as I am interested in this topic.I just got it, turned to the index to look up something andAUGH!!! there is NO INDEX.What is wrong with the editors at Schocken that they wouldn't put an index in this book? It's crazy.I still look forward to reading the book, but it would be so much more useful with an index.I don't blame the author, but the editor really should know better."
3,Mixed blessings,"The film has many wonderful moments and some solid performances; it's a worthy first effort from Ben Affleck as a director, though he would have been better-served to either work out the fractured structure of the script beforehand, and/or hire a better editor. A lot of tension is lost in the choppiness; it's not fluid, and the constant fade outs and ins only dilute the tension and make the key moments seem ham-fisted and melodramatic. The lensing is capable and evocative, but even some set-ups look beyond 'intentionally casual' and don't serve the high aspirations of the film. It's a gritty memorable tale, and a cut above most fare, for sure. I'd recommend despite it's faults."
4,Harsh Baby Harsh,"I'm relatively late to the party here with this review, but I finally looked at Gone Baby Gone after some high praise from some friends. And the high praise was certainly warranted.Have you ever had trouble getting your little brother to do what you tell him to? If you want to make him listen to you, direct a movie and put your little brother in the lead role. That's what Ben Affleck did to his younger brother Casey in Gone Baby Gone, and what a great film they turned out together...with a star-studded supporting cast who all turn in A-List performances.Gone Baby Gone is intense. There's good suspense. There's a great story with unexpected twists. And the movie doesn't sugar-coat the plot with outcomes that will please viewers. Ben Affleck delivers some harsh realities in the lives of some folks that you'll be glad that you're not after seeing Gone Baby Gone.Thoroughly entertaining crime drama about a young child that goes missing from a tough Boston neighborhood. See it."
4,Good Acting,"The acting was very good. The plot line was also well written, not what you expect in this type of movie. They stayed away from the formula driven plots so often over used."
4,"Good movie, great book","I only recently started reading Dennis Lehane's excellent Kenzie and Gennaro series of mysteries and I will recommend that you watch Ben Affleck's film adaptation first, before reading the book. The film is very well done, but after reading the novel, I think it was miscast, except for Amy Ryan as Helene, who was outstanding. Casey Affleck is a good actor but Ben's film would have been better served if he had cast himself as Patrick Kenzie. And most of the other major roles were miscast, as well (in my humble opinion). That said, I think Ben Affleck did an excellent job of directing, and am glad he's enjoying a successful second career as a director because of this film."
4,Disturbing Movie,"This was a very good movie with what I thought was a very disturbing ending. Had I been the one in Ben Afleck's shoes I don't know that I would have done anything differently but you know it wasn't the best decision to make, it ended up costing him everything."
2,gone baby gone,"We had been anxious to see this movie, but we hardly could get through it due to the harsh language and the black subject matter. The DVD we received was defective as it stopped often during scenes. We have sent the video back to the store."
5,gone baby gone reveiw,"this is one of the best movies i have seen , it has all the right elements and surprise in the end."
3,Boston Public,"Overall, this film was mildly entertaining. Casey Affleck was the best part, he's a decent actor, and this was his star making vehicle that brought him out of the woodwork. I liked him in ""To Die For"", he was really young back then and his small part was at least memorable. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a good one time viewing movie, not enough to rewatch in my oppinion. I thought Ed Harris overacted a bit, like he also wanted some oscar recognition. I don't think this film was at all oscar calibur, but something semi-interesting to watch if ur bored. I hated the ending, I did not like the message it conveyed. I think Casey's character should have let the child stay with the couple, but what do I know, right?"
1,waste of time,"I loved the book so much i was sure that the movie wouldn't let me down but i was wrong. Some of my favorite parts from the book didn't even make it into the movie and some of them I feel were really essential to the plot line and were what made it so amazing. Also they changed how some of the characters were. Cheese was nothing like he was in the book which really dissapointed me because part of what i was excited to see in the movie was how they portrayed his character. All of that a side though, even if I hadn't read the book I don't think I would have liked it. I actually think I would have liked it less. It was too jumpy and it felt like I was watching some made for TV movie. I wish I could get the time I wasted watching this movie back."
3,Convoluted Baby Convoluted,I thought this was a pretty good movie but no where near as good as some of the reviews I had heard. It was one of those movies that makes you think one thing is going on but that goes out of its way to make the 'real' story so convoluted and unbelievable that though it fools you it also is unbelievable and ridiculous.Kudos to Ed Harris who is great in everything. Casey Affleck was ok but I don't think he is a great actor. I like Morgan Freeman but he plays the same part in every movie.
4,GJ DC,"The film was really a surprise, the quality of the story, the acting and cast was exceptional. Brilliant portrayal of a complicated and well written storyline made very real and believable. Terrific twists and surprise elements well paced to make it powerful throughout the whole piece!! Outstanding, really outstanding, and Casey Afflect so well cast for this part, much better in this kind of role than his brother would ever be!!!"
4,Affleck has talent as a director,"Gone Baby Gone is Ben Affleck's directorial debut, and it's a good one. He obviously knows this territory-the rough streets of South Boston--and this people, and the result is a movie that feels real, populated by characters who breathe, make mistakes, try their best, and often fail. The movie is full of unexpected turns, but they never feel contrived or silly, as in so many other films. I look forward to seeing Affleck's next movie."
2,"Great book, average movie...","Acting was below average, story line followed book in most parts. Not a big fan of the actor portraying Kenzie."
2,Not good,"Just comes down to annoying characters with their moral high ground every 5 seconds. The main character is annoying, his girlfriend is annoying at the end, etc. Also a medocre story. I do like Ed Harris's job though."
4,NO OTHER COMMENT,"I don't mind saying how I liked the movie, but I don't have any other comments - IS THAT OK ?!!!"
4,Pretty good!,Ben Affleck and his brother do their part well. Good story coupled with good direction makes this film definitely one time watch. Although don't expect an edge of the seat cinema experience. Good to watch if you like slow paced good movies.
1,One Worthless Movie,"This movie is so bad it doesn't deserve a review. Its just a really dumb movie, and badly acted as well. Save your money."
2,Plot twists for the sake of plot twists,"I decide to rent this on a whim after hearing an acquaintance call it one of the best films he's ever seen. Big mistake.Gone Baby Gone plays out like a beefed up whodoneit made for the big screen. I say 'beefed up' in the sense that the writers/producers needed to add an overwhelming number of plot twists to take its basic storyline from the level of Hallmark Channel Original to Major Motion Picture status. This movie has plot twists for the sake of plot twists. While I can say that this movie DID keep my attention for the full 2 hours, I only give it 2/5 stars instead of 3 because the last plot twist is so unbelievably stupid and farfetched that it's a slap in the face to the viewer that just invested 2 hours of his/her time in this."
1,Totally disappointed!,"For the most part i've respected Ben Affleck because i felt his movie choices and acting talent were both very impressive. I've always perceived him as a person with integrity of character and with that said i was really looking forward to his directing debut.But about twenty minutes into gone baby gone, and my senses being assaulted by the incredible amount of vulgarity pouring out of the tv into my livingroom...not to mention finding the story line really confusing, it felt like long enough to want to waste another minute watching this movie."
4,"Good Movie, Not for kids",This movie sent me through a ton of different emotions...tons of suspense and disgust as the Characters were some of the most disgusting mankind has to offer.
5,Well Done Movie,This movie was really well done and got a lot less good publicity than a bunch of other movies that were not nearly as good.
2,LOVED IT RIGHT UP UNTIL THE END.,"Aside from the fact that I had to turn on the subtitles because I couldn't understand half of what the Casey Affleck character saying, the movie was well-made and very well-acted. In this respect, I would give it 4 stars. But I am giving it 2 stars because of the way I felt after watching it. Most of my friends thought this was a great movie. I would tend to agree. But the end just left me drained and disappointed."
4,NASTY language through the whole movie but interesting story,We almost turned this off after the first 30 minutes of one nasty word after another but the story was interesting so we kept watching to the end. Makes you talk about the ending and figure out what you would've done.
5,Very Good Adaptation of a Great Book,"Being a huge fan of Dennis Lehane and his Kenzie/Gennaro novels, I was anxious to see the movie adaptation of Gone Baby Gone. I can't really separate the book and the movie, therefore I do take a bit away from the movie in comparison to the book.First, the good. I liked Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as Patrick and Angie. Although I pictured them to be a bit older, I thought the actors did a fine job. The direction by Ben Affleck is wonderful. The movie did a very good job in following the book, although it was like reading a Cliff's Notes version.I only have two complaints. First, Angie's character is almost non-existent. She's a major player in the book, and much more than just Patrick's girlfriend. Second, I was really hoping to see more of the unstable Bubba Rogowski. He's another major character in the novel and the other novels as well.My complaints aside, this is a terrific movie. Exciting, gritty, and heart-breaking. I highly recommend this film."
3,Gone Baby Gone review,"This is a good film, but runs a little too long. It's an uncomfortable film with many unsympathetic characters."
4,Agree with mumbles,"I would have given this movie 5 stars and I really like Casey Affleck, but we couldn't understand him since he mumbles (effective in ""Assassination of Jesse James"" but not here). Hopefully he will improve on his diction as he goes on, because he has a great face and is a good actor."
2,Ridiculous,"I saw this movie last night and during the first hour, I said to myself, ""Wow, this is one of the best movie I've seen. How come the Oscars totally ignored this movie?"" Sadly, the answer dawned on me during the last 20 minutes of this film. Spoilers now ahead...Apparently, the movie portrayed Boston as a city in some Third World country; no one in this movie has heard of Child Welfare Services. If the girl's mother is unfit, the uncle could have easily contacted welfare services to take the child away and then adopt her legallyor put her in a foster home.. Why is there a need to come up with a convuluted kidnapping scheme involving the police and drug dealers? I'm shaking my head as I type this; it is just that ridiculous of a plot."
3,A 2 Star Movie Only !,I had recorded this movie via my DVR service and movie is Ok or so-so it kinda booring & drags in several areas and plus it is hard to figure out who bad guys are. Our hero wants to get child back for her dope dealing mule crack head mother and back into a sleazy room. Why ? The movie never really states this and skip over to many important points. Our hero girlfriend dumps him at end of movie because he keep thinking he doing the right thing for the child. Morgan Freeman wants this child for his own and is Police Capitan in charge of finding her and is force to leave becasue he is in league with the all to caring Uncle and other policeman freinds who steal the mother dope money that she is rip off her pimp. A family movie it is not and sorry the little girl is left to care for her self while the mother goes off on a date justs days after the little girls gets home. Buy if you must but if you spend over the price of a movie ticket you are spending to much.
4,Sacrificial Lamb,"Very engaging story, but the twists and turns require a greater attention span than perhaps the average person can muster. Ed Harris is amazing, as usual. Morgan Freeman is most effective in his role and the film is given solid direction from Ben Affleck. Unfortunately, the lack of intensity of character arising from Casey Affleck (as a principal character throughout the film) does not warrant, in my humble opinion, a Best Actor nod which the critics appear to be pushing for. 2007 Best Supporting Actor nods, however, should go to ED HARRIS and AMY RYAN."
3,disappointing blu ray quality,"for such a class movie, blu ray quality really sucks, big time. quality started off great, sharp images and great sound , then all ofa sudden, in a lot of scenes there was just so much film grain in certain scenes really made me want to just turn off the movie,studio lapsed in putting out such a down graded reproduction of an exceptionally great film that the idiot in charge of releasing should be fired.was going to dump my dvd but i think i'll hold onto it for a while longer until a real re-mastered blu copy is released.again,shame on you disney..."
3,"Stylish Abduction Mystery -- See Baby, See","This movie is a mixed bag for me -- hence the three-star rating. Specifically ...Pro's* Strong cast that includes heavyweights like Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and Amy Madigan* Powerful cinematography portraying the grittiness of Dorchester and the human ""characters"" who populate this working class worldCon's* Casey Affleck and his hot girlfriend (Monaghan) seem just too pretty and callow for us to believe they possess the ""street cred"" that we're supposed to think they have* The plot has more twists than an origami sculpture and can be a bit demanding on and confusing to viewers to take it all in in real time and follow what's going onInteresting! A close call between a three- or four-star rating."

4,enjoyed it,"its great seeing Casey Affleck get a chance to shine in this movie. Its well directed by his bro Ben Affleck. Something about him makes me want to know what happens to not only his character but Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and Michelle Monaghan (his partner in their detective agency). It revolves around a 4 year old girl that has been kidnapped from her home. Such as it is because the mother is an alcoholic and drugged out poor excuse who leaves her child home to be watched by other people.The film itself which runs almost two hours manages to keep the pace going along steadily with all kinds of plot turns, twists and different agendas that the other characters have in the movie. They all turn out to be important leads to Casey having to make a major decision that will not affect him but others around him as well. Will he make the right or wrong choice? One way to find out check out, Gone Baby Gone and see what it has to offer."
5,Top Mystery,Really enjoyed the suspense and the use of non professional actors from the neighborhood. The ending is a surprize and has me wondering if the private detective made the right choice.
3,Twists come late,Some of the twists were predictable and the ones that weren't came too late in the story. It was just okay.
5,Perfect,"This movie arrived quick and it perfect condition. The movie was wrapped and unopened. Works great, just as expected. Perfect!"
5,Great movie...,I thought the movie was really good. Never heard of it before and purchased it because of the price for a Affleck production seemed like a worthwhile movie. I was right. I really like it.
3,WHERE'S THE ENDING!!????,"Overall, this was a good movie - it keep you guessing - but the ending was stupid - there really wasn't an ending!! I hate when movies end like that!!"
2,"Quite good, until the end. No Spoilers","I had heard a lot of good about this film so I decided to check it out. Well, I was truly into it and the mystery surrounding the characters that I had my hopes up for a (finally) great movie in 2007. Weeeellll, then the end happened and I think my jaw dropped because I was in such shock. And not because it was good, but because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was just so wrong and odd and ridiculous that it actually made me hate the movie altogether. It truly was a great film until that point. I could not believe I had wasted my time. What a dissapointment."
2,Too Much Effing Language,I read some reviews and thought I would give this movie a shot. I mean it starred Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. The story line was actually pretty intriguing. But I just got tired of hearing the eff word in every other line. I guess the one positive point of this movies was giving me gratitude that I don't move in the same circles as the people being portrayed. I'm sorry I wasted the $10. But it could have been worse. I could have wasted more.
2,Didn't get past the first 15 minutes,"I really wanted to watch this movie, given the outstanding reviews. I just could not take the relentless profanity. I realize it's depicting a seamy environment, and I get that, but when 90% of every sentence in the bar scene is a string of filthy words, it just becomes a distraction. No movie needs that much profanity to make its point. Despite Affleck's other directing chops, I regard the overuse of profanity as a weakness. I would try to watch this again if it came on on TV, where they bleep out all the distracting words, because the characters are strong and the plot is compelling."
5,Great Movie!,"The plot is excellent.I have a thing for all gritty urban dramas set in Boston (Good Will Hunting, The Departed, Mystic River, etc.). This is one of them. There is a lot of foul language, but if you can handle that-- the movie is well worth watching."
4,Twists and Turns,"This diverting mystery is full of twists and turns, surprising villains and imperfect heroes. While it is not a deep metaphysical work, it does leave the viewer with some interesting questions to ponder in the end."
5,Great buy,"The perfect price, arrived fast. a great movie. Recommend everyone to watch this movie. Very good cast, direction, and storyline."
2,Great movie ruined by a terrible ending,"Ben Affleck screwed this one up. He couldn't have just let the family ride off into the sunset, no, his brother had to be a moron and be all ""by the book"" and bring everyone to justice. Now the little girl will suffer for it. BAD ENDING to a potentially great movie."
1,YUCK BABY YUCK,"Who wants to watch a movie about drug addict trash mothers who have no business breeding? Crappy story, crappy ending."
1,Ben Affleck is useless,"What a waste of time... Ridiculous story, unspeakable dialogue. Thank god Ben has taken a break from acting if that's what you call it, but buddy, please stick with parenting and let the wife bring in the cash. This movie has a strong cast, but I was embarrassed for them."
1,Gone Baby Gone,"The movie sucks. How could a person living in this day and age not see the future for this little girl. He should have had some balls, and left her with the Captain and his wife."
1,DONT BUY IT RENT ENDING SUCKS LOL,yeah yeah suppose 2 b a good movie but d director dont know what to do poor amanda lol
3,A good movie by one Afflec destroyed by another!,"A thoroughly interesting storyline, good screenplay, excellent depiction of the growing American underclass (this time in Boston) made for only a decent experience due entirely to the mistake of Ben bringing his little brother on as the main male character. His acting resembled a school play in a very small school on a bad day!Try to ignore it and the movie is actually good and worth another Star. It raises important ethical dilemmas in today's world."
5,The Affleck's are awesome,Very entertaining. Had a great screenplay and some great lines to quote later to your friends.
3,Missing Pages,"I was very pleased with the amount of time it took the seller to send my item to me. The seller was very timely and that to me, is crucial in showing professionalism.However, I was not very happy when I found out that it was missing numerous pages throughout the textbook, some scattered pages and a few chunks. Giving details concerning any missing pages/information would have come in handy in this case."
3,This book had its highs and lows,I liked the suspense presented in this book. It is one of those edge of your seat thrillers. The things I did not like is the fact that it had a shallow type of comedie added to it. The ending left my angered.
1,AT&T 1487 not so good,The answering system on the unit I purchased is acceptable. The audio quality of the cordless handset is disappointing: I hear a constant hiss when using it.
2,not great for telecommuting,"There are 2 standout issues regarding this phone:1. No mute button on the cordless handset. There is a mute on the base, but it seems like a grave omission not to have mute on the other handset.2. When you insert or remove a headset into the headset jack, it makes a horrible screeching noise on the other end.If you need a phone for telecommuting, look elsewhere."
2,Wireless Handset is Static,"I wanted a combo speaker phone and answering machine, so this one looked great. Overall it is OK, but let me point out the items not so great:- No battery backup, so the clock has to be set again if you have a power outage.- The cordless handset is very much full of static, even close to the base, and even if you try to change channels.- When you do loose power, the unit does not dial in touch-tone- it uses pulse!- The caller ID history use useless since you can't append a 1 for long distance calls.The LCD display should show more answering machine features, instead it is just caller ID and directory numbers.On the plus side, for the number of features, the price is right, and it has been reliable so far."
3,buy if you can not do better,"I bought this because I wanted a very cheap 2.4ghz corded/cordless telephone. It turned out to be just that. The display in the hand set went in a few days. The handset also seem a bit big and the sound quality could be better. The corded station is much better but programming and menu use is a bit confusing. As my headline suggest, you can buy if you are cash strapped and you need a 2.4ghz corded/cordless."
5,Superior Info and Pictures!,"This wonderful book, portrays 47 different historical churches and cathedrals in the sprawling city of London. There are many detailed pictures which portray these buildings with all their splender. It also gives detailed information on the buildings themselves, their overall history, and it tells the names of the architects. It was an insiteful book, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who has an appreciation for architecture and enjoys beautiful pictures of magnificent houses of worship."
4,great overview of london locales...,"great overview of london churches and cathedrals. book sports many pictures with supporting text. makes me want to go beyond the ""biggies"" like westminster abbey and visit the out of the way spots."
4,Good for finding Pen Pals too,"I bought this book several years ago -- and found it fascinating. At that point, I had already met the man of my dreams thru the personals, and wanted to find pen pals and friends. I found this book very helpful, but, alas, the pen pals I made have since faded.The only negative thing I could say about this book is that even a year after its publish date, some of the organization addresses were out of date!The most positive thing I can say about this book is the author's positive, go-for-it attitude. A superb resource for those of us who enjoy writing letters!!"
1,Sorry excuse for Record Company Profit,"First I would like to say that I am huge Cyndi Lauper fan. I ordered this CD with quite bit of anticipation.What I got upon listening was nothing but disappointment. These tracks might have some appeal in certain NY nightclubs, but they are not very musical. If what you want is alot of percussion and deep bass, then this album is for you. If singing and musicality (melody) is your thing, run away from purchasing this CD (I would have preferred stronger language...).Cyndi is a very talented artist, but to have her music warped in this manner takes all the joy out of listening..."
4,Cyndi Rocks and should be able to share more of her talent,"Hey Now! (Remixes & Rarities) is a great CD and well worth the money. I believe there are many other rare songs and mixes out there by this enormous talent, and they should be released as well. The dance mixes are great for today's dancefloor and for those who like Cyndi's softer side, ""The World Is Stone"" is a must have. This song is in my opinion one of Cyndi's best contributions in music. The video can be found on her ""Twelve Deadly Cyns"" video collection. The only downside to this CD is that ""Hole In My Heart"" should have been on this collection; however, it is a great addition to any CD library."
5,My Favorite Christmas Album,"This is my favorite Christmas Album and I am so bummed that it is currently unavailable. I grew up listening to it every year and no Christmas is the same without it. My parents have the record, but no record player, so sadly the past few Christmases I have missed hearing it. I hope it comes out on CD soon. If anyone else feels my pain, ""Music of Christmas"" by Percy Faith is a good substitute."
5,Please reissue this CD........,"The musical orchestration on this CD is wonderful and very memorable. I have the record, but now have no turntable to play it on. Most new receivers do not come with a phono hook up. Everything is on CDS. The arrangements on this CD bring back fond memories for me of hearing them being played on radio, WPAT, Patterson, (for those of you who are old enough to remember and come from the tri-state area of New York). Please reissue this, in time for Christmas, 2005."
5,Available,"This album is available (as of Sept. 2010) on iTunes for $5.99 under the title ""Hallelujah."" I'm not sure why you can't get it from Amazon.com."
3,The title is not the only difference,"There's another important distinction betweenHallelujahandMusic of Christmas, Volume 2: the first is mono, the second is stereo! The recordings are the same; meaning, it was recorded once, then mixed separately for mono and stereo release. (By contrast the first ""Music of Christmas"" album was recorded mono in 1954 and then completely RE-recorded stereo. Same tunes, but slight differences in tempi and volume give it away.) Listen to the sample tracks onHallelujahand the sound is good but definitely mono. I'm holding out for stereo. Caveat emptor!"
2,too small,"too small for Camry or Prius... even a little too small for a Civic, but it is easy to fold."
2,Winplus Sunshade,"The product is not good at shading sunlight. The fabric is not opaque but actually sheer, so it lets a lot of sunlight through it. There is also a lot of black fabric fringe, which absorbs heat, further raising the interior heat. Lastly, the way it is sewn together keeps it from fully opening so you can't get full coverage across the windshield."
5,AN INTELLIGENT LYNCH BOOK,"I strongly disagree with the reviewer from NY. This book is definitely NOT ""pointless"" though I can see why die-hard Lynch fans might get a bit miffed by Johnson's presentation of Lynch as a conservative. This book actually analyses ALL of his films from a literary perspective -- I like especially his Nietzschean slant on the early experimental films. It's not a vehicle to glorify Lynch but it certainly acknowledges his allure and his achievement. I think it's a must-read for serious students of cinema."
1,completely wrong,"Okay, I'm a fan, not a critic. I didn't read this entire book, just skimmed it after I got the basic gist of it. I'd suggest to any Lynch fan to try to get this from the library before buying it, which luckily I did, because you won't want to own it. This writer is convinced his theories are correct and everyone else, including David Lynch himself, are the ones misintepreting. One thing I know he gets wrong: he claims Lynch takes himself so seriously that there is no irony or humor in his work. Just because you don't get it, doesn't mean it isn't there, Lynch's unique sense of humor shows up in all his work. And to claim that the study of ""good"" and ""evil"" in dramatic fashion forwards a conservative agenda makes no sense to me whatsoever. I guess you either ""get"" Lynch or you don't, and this writer does not. The only thing I got out of reading it was to make note of the other writers he refers to who he says are all wrong."
1,pointless,"If you are a David Lynch fan you'll most likely hate this book as it goes to great lengths to discredit him as a true artist. By the same token, if you don't like Lynch I doubt that you'd want to pay $32.00 and waste your time reading this book to justify your lack of interest.I love David Lynch and found this book to be misguided at best and completely idiotic at worst. (it was a gift)I am not an Oliver Stone fan, however the idea of actually buying a book on why he's not a great filmaker seem fairly pointless."
2,won't hold black oil sunflower seed,"I bought this as a gift for a friend in another state, I just got a report from her that the wire mesh is too large to hold black oil sunflower seeds. This was the reason I bought it, so I'm going to have to give it a very low grade."
1,Poor quality,"Poor quality reproduction. I agree with the other reviewer. I played the collection on two separate DVD devices to verify. Too many artifacts (blobs of dust) and jerky movements. The sound was muddy. For films with snappy dialogue, these were a disappointment. Closed captioning was not available.A side note, I usually check for closed-captioning before I purchase a DVD, this time I was too enticed by the low price. Generally, inclusion of CC indicates slightly better quality DVD production. And, NO, simply turning up the TV volume does not help."
4,Planet wave strap,For the money is is a very good strap. It does what it is suppose to do hold your guitar.
4,DOESNT WORK WITH MY TAYLOR,"I love the idea of this strap! The only downfall is that it doesnt work with my Taylor JMSM acoustic guitar...it just doesnt fit, so keep that in mind! Its built very well though..."
4,"Good Strap, Great Price.",I bought one of these because I want to eventually have straps for all my guitars.It's not the greatest guitar strap ever made but it does the job.I do wish the ends that connected the strap to the guitar were a little firmer; not so soft. I worry slightly about the guitar slipping out of the hook/flap thing if I get too wild.I love the price. I like that it is plain black and it doesn't have a bunch of frivolous bulls*** all over it like some straps out there.I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive guitar strap.
5,very good strap,"gutiarcenter is selling this same strap for double what i paid. nice a sturdy, and easy to use. great buy"
4,Solid functional strap,"very strong...easy to use...fits my Les Paul and Tele with no problems...just wish they would make a leather one or offer a few more 'style' options.Overall I love Planet Waves gear (cables, straps, locking machines etc) and this strap is as good as I have found and way easier to use than installing strap locks."
4,"Not a cool looking strap, but it works","I had a leather strap which was really comfortable but it would always fall off. This one is not as comfortable, but really stays in place. At the end of the day, it's not UNcomfortable and it's much safer! recommended."
3,"Works great, but...","I loved this strap until one of the plastic locks broke in the middle of a gig. Actually the plastic loop that the actual strap goes through just snapped open and fell right off the strap, taking my Strat down with it. I may have had a defective strap, though I did use it for a good long while before that happened. Like I say, it was great while it lasted. Okay guys or gals from Planet Waves, if you just read this, yes you can send me a new strap and I'll write another review about how you replaced the product and about what a cool a company you've got there. I'll hold onto the strap so I can send you a pic of it!"
2,Not so great,"There's a reason why this strap is relatively inexpensive - it isn't very good.1. The polypropylene web that the strap is made of is grating against the skin. I keep adjusting my shirt while playing so that the rough material of the strap won't dig into my neck or shoulder.2. Planet Waves' gimmick - the supposedly universal strap lock - is actually a hinderance. The locks are so large and bulky that they interfere with the guitar's body. I can't use the strap on my acoustic, because the lock is too big to fit onto the strap button located where the guitar neck joins the body. It's also annoying to use the strap on my Les Paul-type electric because - AGAIN - the lock mechanism is so bulky that it constantly interferes with the amp cable where it plugs into the output socket on the guitar.I was taken in by the low price & the company's marketing blurb. Now I have to buy an actually decent strap and am stuck with Planet Waves' inferior product. Don't do the same."
2,wrong color,"This product looks fresh and pretty in color, but in reality the guitar strap's color looks nothing like the official picture."
1,It is very uncomfortable,"Call me a sissy or what you may, but when I use this strap, the back of the front end of it rubs against my skin and after a few minutes REALLY starts to hurt. I have adjusted the strap every which way and it's just not even worth it. Pay a little more and get the d'addario strap that clips on. I was too big of a cheap ass to pay for another one of them, and I regret it."
2,:(,"Good but too much fuss, they did not fit on my end pins but free ones can be obtained from the company with the purchase of the product that do fit, its annoying to deal with"
1,No locking part on the strap...?,"Unlike all the reviews I'm seeing and the picture of the item itself, my strap did not come with any kind of locks on it. It's just a regular red strap with leather (or fake leather) ends to stick the strap pins into. There's no locking mechanism to speak of. I don't know if I was just sent the wrong item or what, but it's a Planet Waves strap, looks otherwise identical to the picture above."
5,Much nicer than expected,"Pleasantly surprised with the quality and workmanship on a $5.00 guitar strap. I was expecting a lot worse. I have several very nice leather straps but they all have the strap-loc system. I needed a simple strap for three guitars that have strap buttons that cannot be removed or replaced. The Planet Waves simple woven nylon strap works perfectly. The portion that attaches to the strap button is leather and all the adjustment rings are made of smooth, rounded black nylon and quite sturdy, plus they won't scratch your guitar . I'm using this strap on a Turner Renaissance RS-6 and two Yamaha Silent guitars all of which are very light in weight. This strap is probably best suited for acoustic guitars. With solid body electrics, I would think the heavier weight guitars would cause the strap to dig into your shoulder since there is no padding. For my intended use, it's very comfortable, well made, and a real bargain for the price. Couldn't ask for more."
1,this will destroy your guitar,I got one of these as a gift and it doesn't fit on Jackson strap buttons and it ripped the strap buttons out of my PRS because the ends are too rigid to flex I have owned 9 guitars and it has only fit two the PRS which it damaged and my Gibson which has Dunlop strap locks so it was just a test and I wouldn't leave them on it I would recommend buying Dunlop strap locks instead because you can have a mor comfortable strap that won't destroy your guitar
3,Has A Small Stain.,It fits good and came in the color i expected. But there was one thing wrong. The strap had a small stain. I don't know why? It said it was brand new. But maybe not.
5,Very comfortable guitar strap,I've been using it for three days now and it's very comfortable. The strap is pretty thick and the material feels very durable. I haven't had any complaints about this strap yet.
4,"Good, generic strap","I wanted a good, basic strap that just gets the job done and that's exactly what this is. It attaches and detaches easily, is easy to adjust, and has held up nicely over the several months I've owned it."
4,It works.,It works but it's not amazing in terms of comfort. It has two holes on both ends so you need to find a way to strap it around the neck of the guitar. I used a leather shoe string and it works just fine!
3,Good for the price.,"I got more than I payed for. The strap is serviceable, leather ends, adjustable and overall a fine strap. I wish the fabric were thicker, but you really can't beat it for the price."
5,Works For Me,"This strap works very well for me andmy relatively light Michael Kelly Hybrid.This is not only a light weight strap, butalso has built in strap locks. A nice strap cancost about twenty bucks, strap locks run about twentybucks. Forty bucks verses eleven - you make your own choice.I usually play in a temperature controlled environment wearing a sweater.I do have some heavier guitars with which I prefer to use wider guitar straps.Two more points - this strap takes up almost no room in my case and goes on in a flash.I think I ""might"" recommend it for lighter guitars... :-)"
1,Doesn't work with G&L ASAT,strap locks don't fit over the large strap buttons on my ASAT so its useless for me. Would be nice if they told us what it is compatible with or not compatible with
5,Good quality strap.,"I bought this strap to put on my 3 year old son's toy guitar. I had to shorten it a bit for it to fit right, but it's a very sturdy strap that has held up well through lots of ""concerts"" and ""practicing"". Highly recommended."
4,Great for the price,"I was just looking for something in expensive for the guitar I have and this works great, a little hard to get on at first but holds the guitar well and allows for a good balanced weight across the shoulder."
3,For the price you can't go wrong,"For the price this is an excellent guitar strap like the others have said. It has a nice lock strap that will be easy to get on and off. Very good quality for the price, Planet Waves makes great guitar stuff for cheap.Edit:I am returning this strap. It was nice quality for the price, but I found a better one for double the price that has it's own locking ends on it built in. I didn't know how to use this locking strap."
3,Great Product,"I have purchased other Planet Waves products and have been pleased with the quality. The straps locked right up to my PRS Single Cut without any problems. The locks are secure enough to keep you from worrying about dropping you instrument. Nice to find a great strap that does not use leather or any other animal products (leather processing is not environmentally friendly, not to mention the labor issues in India). Great product that does exactly what it is supposed to do. Nice simple strap that breathes enough to keep your shoulder cooler."
2,A good idea but they dropped the ball,"When I got my strap I was really excited about it but, that excitement wore off as soon as I saw that, because my guitar has the pin in the back of the guitar, the only way of fitting the lock in it would make the design of the strap backwards and there is no way to fit it any other way. If the lock is design to only be able to fit it one way, at the very least it should say in the description that guitars that have the forward pin in the back of the body will not be able to use this locks."
1,whats wrong with you amazon!,"I clicked on a strap with the locking ends. When I changed the color aparently it changed it to a strap without the locking ends. Bad glitch with the system, the strap is fine for a non locking strap but that's not what I ordered."
1,came smelling smokey,"its a guitar strap. fits like one. i had trouble with it because it came smelling like a smokers den. the smell in itself kept me wary for days. it hold the guitar, but not pleasanTly. :-)"
3,locking strap,good locking mechanism but does not fit most of my guitars. the strap leaves something to be desired also.
3,Planet Waves Locking Nylon Guitar Strap Review,"I bought two of these (one order).1. The lock works fine for a normal guitar button layout. The lock ONLY works with the grey side towards the guitar. If your guitar has a button on the back you have to either wear the strap twisted (boo), or try to find someone who can sew to remount the strap.2. Didn't have any problem with ""cracking plastic"" which I saw in another post.3. If I had the opportunity to buy the strap again I would get the locking leather strap. I would have bought the leather one initially but I didn't see it on Amazon. The edge of the nylon strap when mounted on my fender bass cuts into my neck like sawgrass so I'm looking to get locking buttons and a leather strap.4. The nylon strap does fit in my case with my bass nicely since it is so thin.5. Makes a good backup strap for friends at church who always forget to bring a strap."
2,Doesn't fit all guitars,"Just bought this strap, not very pleased. It doesn't fit my hollow body (ibanez ag95) and on the guitars it does fit i would be afraid of using. It seems that after a bit of use it would start taking off the finish of the guitar. the actual strap doesn't feel too comfortable either. Im going to stick with Levy's leather straps from now on. they may cost more but are worth the money."
3,Works,The strap work for it purpose. There is nothing exraordinary about it. I just wanted something inexpensive for my daughter's guitar
4,Good strap.,"The threads can sometimes come undone slightly and make you itch if they come in contact with skin, but it's still a great strap and holds up solidly. Would certainly buy again."
1,Bad,"I thought this book was weakly written, depending on cliched characters and situations. If you are looking for something to take your mind away for an hour (but that won't haunt you for days afterwards), this might just be your book."
4,Good clean fun,"Tom Selleck, writer of mysteries, is enchanted by a beautiful foreigner, Paulina Porizkova. Searching for a new spin for his fictional character, this writer finds a plot brewing in the eyes of the alluring murder suspect. In the process he falls in love but at the same time is unsure of her innocence. Will he be the next victim? Their interplay is charming but not sophisticated. This is a simple, fun movie with loads of laughs."
3,"""Do you feel the points of my love globes?""","Tom Selleck and Paulina Porizkova do a decent acting job in the movie. The last part of the movie was a bit of a let-down, but overall it is OK. In a nutshell, Porizkova is suspected of a crime, and writer Selleck offers an alibi for her in exchange for a story.The best part, responsible for all three stars I've given the DVD, is Selleck's narration of the book his character is writing. That is really funny. The plot and story is mostly non-existent or far-fetched, but the contrast between reality and what he writes is amusing.No extras at all on the DVD. Rated PG for some language. No sex or nudity - rats!"
2,Strangely Compelling,"I have to agree with most of the other reviews. This movie not great art but to me it is great comedy and strangely compelling. I have found myself watching it over and over again. I would rate the film as five-stars. Unfortunately, I can not buy the DVD because the cheapskates at Warner have only released this in butchered full-screen format. As such, I can only rate this DVD as two-stars and certainly no stars for Warner."
4,Underrated,A fun and also exciting movie. Not a masterpiece but it has humour and drama mixed and most of all it brings a very nice feeling. One gets glad watching it. I liked it a lot. Cute.They don't make films like this anymore. Not this type of films. Sadly.
4,Her Alibi...,"I stumbled upon this one while flipping channels on 08/12/2007. It was 'savaged' by the critics, if my memory serves.'Her Alibi"" isn't half-bad. In fact, I rather liked it! In several scenes, I actually laughed out loud. If you don't take it too seriously, you should have fun with this one. Four stars!!"
4,People of Zee World ...,"This movie does not explain The Meaning of Life nor does it try to. It is a diversionary entertainment, and a pretty good one at that! Along the way, it retro's our former preoccupation with the USSR and its Bloc countries. It's fun. Try it, you'll like it! As the Vivid Parrot in Tom Robbins' ""Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates"" counsels: ""People of Zee World, Relax!"""
4,Her Alibi,"Being a fan of reading, reading mysteries, and a 'johnny-come-lately' fan of Tom Selleck's -- post-Magnum PI, which I NEVER watched, I really enjoyed this movie. Unlike most critics, I want to be entertained and this movie does it for me. The scenes 'AFTER THE GREAT CASSEROLE DINNER' are among some of the most priceless I've ever seen and the movie is worth viewing, if only for that alone! And, seeing Patrick Wayne with a ponytail as his neighbor, just adds to the fun of it! Of course, I only wish that I could be and look like Paulina Porizkova. Run, don't walk, to get your copy of this amusing movie where the 'bad guys' get battered!"
5,A very entertaining movie !,Buy it. The DVD only costs $10 here in Amazon. This is a very entertaining movie. Tom Selleck is great and Paulina Porizkova is so good in this movie that makes me wonder why she doesn't make more movies. The picture quality of the DVD is very good. Bright and colorful. Too bad Warner chose to release this DVD as their $15 Budget series so there is no extra features at all. But seing Paulina Porizkove is good enough to justify the purchase of this fine DVD which no one that has DVD player should be without.
2,Pretty disappointed,"I have never seen in my life a programming book that chooses to use SCREEN shots for TEXT windows. If you can read the tiny code samples (the reason one would buy a book like this!) then maybe you'd find it of value. I never unwrapped the CD because I felt the book was tedious to read and gave weak examples. I give it two over one stars because if it were the only book on the subject it might be worth reading, but fortunately it is not. Conversely the PHP fast and easy book was excellent so that is why I bought this one. Shame on PrimaTech to not use the same standards."
2,Not really worth it.,"Movie looked interesting and I watched it despite the issues it has. The acting is mediocre and the plot is too predictable. Not worth a 1 star, but not worth the time to watch."
1,Not even entertaining,This film was worthless.Not een a bad TV movie. Who could rate it higher than an ants behind. Fat snipers don't work for our government.The only worthwhile part of the film was the interrogation of Baldwin.This is a film so cheaply made that it could be a Home video. The acting was not even that good. The only beleivable character in the film was??
4,Good for major roads,"We used this map to get from San Jose to Quepos and around the Costarena Sur highway. It was detailed enough for that purpose. We probably didn't really need it, but it was comforting to see the little towns pass by--just to know we were still on the correct road. It's CR after all, not everything is well-marked."
4,Tom Cruise fan,I bought this movie for my daughter who has been a Tom Cruise fan for more than 20 years. It was one of his early movies and he looks so young in it.
5,CALVIN AND HOBBES OUR HILLAROUS IN THIS BOOK,CALVIN AND HOBBES SUNDAY BOOK IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNNY BOOKSEVER WRITTEN BY BILL WATTERSON.IF IT WAS A MOVIE I would give it4 thumbs up. If YOU LVE CALVIN AMD HOBBES THIS IS THE BOOK TO GET
1,Bought for a grandchild -- he liked it -- I didn't.,I had forgotten how nasty Calvin was & how much a kid might find him funny; thank heaven it was still in comic format to keep the illusion the high jinks are imaginary -- not a real life blue print on how kids behave.
4,Excelent Buy!,"A friend of mine had this book and let me borrow it for awhile, so I proceeded to copy down in a notebook my favorite recipes before she wanted it back. Since then, I've been holding onto those pages for dear life while searching for a copy of my own! Every recipe I've tried so far has been a huge success. This book has excelent recipes, easy to follow instructions, and mouth-watering pictures to go with it all. Also, I look for cookbooks that have more than a handful of recipes in it. I don't want to waste money on an entire book when I can, well, just copy down my favorites in a notebook. However, this is one of those books that is well worth the money you spend. Lots of recipes, hundreds of ideas. I highly recommend investing in this book."
2,Stapless Satin Classic A Line Dress Green,"The dress is made as the pattern shows but the coloring of the dress is much darker a green than is shown on viewing the item on line. It is a sort of muddy green. A brighter green much as was shown on the screen view would have been much better. Please ship the product you see pictured on the screen, same color and shape."
5,Exactly What I Wanted,"This dress was a perfect fit, looks nice and is very versatile. I was initially concerned that it was a little more muted silver than metallic silver, but in pictures and under lights, it shines! I would purchase it again in a heartbeat!"
4,"Very nice, but -","A little large in the bust, but I'd already read other reviews and knew this so I ordered based on my waist. The dress fits perfectly there and altering it shouldn't cost much. I think my best friend's bridesmaids will look amazing."
5,Very pleased with the Satin dress.,"Very pleased with the baby pink satin dress, that I'm going to wear in a wedding."
5,Beautiful,"The color was vibrant and shining. The dress was gorgeous and just looked like good quality. Another seller called PacificPlex sells this same dress called a 50's satin strapless dress, but I prefer this one by the seller GoJane. It costs a few more dollars, but it's worth it. Go with GoJane for better quality dress."
5,Beautiful,"This dress was extremely beautiful. I loved it. The only problem was that it was the wrong size. I had to send it back and I hated that fact. It was silky smooth and elegant. If they had my size, I'd definitely order it again."
4,Sizing,"The only problem that I have encountered is that the size chart that was on Amazon was not the same as on the gojane website, thus my dress is small and it may have to returned for a bigger size!"
3,Old time bell dress,"The dress is nice, but it is not ""streamline"". It flows out like a bell. It is easy to alter it to make it more form fitting."
4,Nice for Value,"Item was shipped quickly, and when it didn't fit, return was easy and hassle free exchange was a refreshing change. The item iteself will need some slight modification (hemming, straps added) but that is to be expected of any bridesmaid dress one buys off the rack. I will use this company again."
1,this dress was HORRIBLE,I bought it for a friends sweet sixteen and it was awful. it just did not fit at all. it was way tooo small. also it took about a month+ for them to refund the money. bad experiance!!
5,Every Night Josephine,"Anyone who's had and/or loved a dog will love this true story of Jacqueline Susann and her poodle, Josephine--especially the sections on Josephine's housebreaking. Absolutely a riot! I first read this when I was going through a very painful divorce many years ago. Despite my emotional state, this book made me laugh out loud numerous times. It was better than going to a therapist--and a whole lot cheaper!Every Night, Josephine!"
5,The book I have read 10+ times that always makes me LOL!,"This is my all time favorite book that I read every couple of years, since 1964, and each time I do, I still laugh out loud even though I have read it so many times. I have also owned 9 copies of it because I lend it and never get it back. I was not a poodle owner until 1976, years after I read the book, but found everything she wrote about Josephine was true. And I could identify with so much that went on in her life because I grew up in the 50s, in Massapequa (Long Island), and spent a lot of time in New York City. I now have 6 poodles and with their own personalities, but are still so much like Josephine. So if you are contemplating getting a poodle read this book and then decide. And make sure you have a lot of time because it is very hard to put down."
4,Solid rocker all the way,"This is a metal release by Gillan. Do not confuse this with the pre Mr. Universe stuff. Janick Gers of Iron Maiden starts the proceedings with a fast one called ""Whats The Matter"" and then cruises into a monumental Sabbath/Zeppelin esque riff on ""Bluesy Blue Sea"". Gillan sounds fantastic, if you liked ""Born Again"" with Sabbath, or NWOBHM you will love this."
1,Very Poor Product,This product tastes as if about half water. Not like the many other Prince of Peace products I have used in the past.
5,everyone must see this movie!!!,"AMAZINGLY FABULOUS/CHEEZY/HILARIOUS/WEIRD/80'S SCI-FI-HORROR EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS! THE ""MASKED REVIEWER"" WROTE AN AMAZING REVIEW! READ HIS REVIEW!!!!!!"
4,This workis if you're hard-core sci-fi fan...,"I enjoy Sci-fi, and this is some pretty good work. Most people wouldn't emjoy movie like these, but I happen to really be into the sci-fi world. Kristofferson and Ladd are two strong characters who fall in love, even though Ladd is a time-jumper from the future who can't seem to fix the mistake that her crew created in Kristofferson's past. Anyhow, I liked it."
3,It's so bad it's funny.,"My wife and I have joked about this film for years now. It looks like it was made in the 1970s (Kris Kristoffersen?) yet it wasn't. Completely ridiculous plot, horrible acting, silly special effects. I love time travel films, but this one is the worst by far.Yet, somehow you have to see it to believe it. See this film and have a good laugh!"
4,"Sherman, send the gate","We are medially confronted with a midair plain crash. In the confusion the navigator goes back into the cabin and is horrified by something. All we see is a staring device sliding along the floor ""MILLENNIUM"".Bill Smith investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board (Kris Kristofferson) is dispatched to the crash scene. he must make since of things that do not add up to a normal crash. Meanwhile he is being asked about the anomalies by a physicist (Daniel J. Travanti) that seems to know moiré than he is letting on. And to make things more complicated he is being sidetracked by a female airline employee (Cheryl Ladd) that does not seem to do everything from driving to eating awkwardly.Bill wonders if he is tired, paranoid or is there something that is just not normal?The music and filming remind me of a Hallmark romance movie which just happens to have a sci-fi background."
3,"An Interesting Mood, A Lost Opportunity","I mean, is Kris Kristofferson the worst actor in film history or what? Next to this guy a sheet of plywood is Sir Laurence Olivier. It's hard to decide who shows a greater range of emotion, Kristofferson or the pathetically lame talking robot. At least the robot had an excuse for not being able to move his face. Sorry, had to get that out. The shame here is that Millenium is a very compelling story, and the film does create an interesting, unsettling mood. It does get under your skin a bit, like a not very good tune that you can't stop singing. Cheryl Ladd is fine, though burdened with community theatre level dialogue. With a good screenwriter and a male lead that could convince you his character was something other than a bump on a soggy log, this could have been a winner. As it is it's a deepy flawed oddity that I go back to every year for some twisted fun."
3,novel explains it all,"I haven't seen this film. What?! Then why am I reviewing it? Because I've read the novel AND George Alexeief's review, and I can't help but point out that all George's questions are answered in the novel. Sounds like maybe Varley couldn't see that some of the movie would be incomprehensible to someone who hadn't read the novel. Adapting a novel (ignore Maltin's reference to the short story -- Millennium is a novel) must be more difficult than it might seem."
1,feels longer than a millenium,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and the thing I remember most was that halfway through I was so bored that I wandered out and bought popcorn and played video games for a while before going back to check on my friend in the theatre. I asked what I had missed and she just looked up with glazed eyes and said ""nothing, they just had the longest flashback in movie history and replayed half the movie! ""This story had potential, but was just so badly done that it is almost unwatchable.Later I found the story it was based on, I think it was about 8 pages and covered everything it need to."
2,Another hokey time travel movie...,"Millenium was probably the most famous outing for Kris Kristoferson. Starring as a NTSB investigator, he stumbles upon time travelers from a future earth. The entire movie's concept is interesting and innovative, however the acting is OK with dialog that seems forced and artificial at many places. Probably the biggest letdown of this potential blockbuster was the special effects, all of which seem fake. Everything from the robots in the future, to the opening scene when the pilots in one airline jet look out their cockpit to see another airline jet coming on top of them; all the special effects could have been improved upon. Overall, an OK flick that is alright for at-home viewing."
3,Millenium/Stargate worth the set,Millenium is worth watching for die hard fans. Good storyline even though the characters are a bit dated and showing wear. Capricorn 1 was only worth seeing OJ in something other than a courtroom.
3,Cheesy 80s Sci-fi,"Based on an interesting story by John Varley (Air Raid). It made a mediocre movie. If you an the mood for that, it's fine, but don't expect anything thoughtful or insightful. It's not very exciting, either. Not horrible, just bland. You can read Varley's novelization of Air Raid, it's probably better than the movie.Millennium"
2,Lame movies from lame people,"What a waste of shiny plastic disc! Out of all the decent and semi-decent Sci-fi flicks, they pick the bottom of the barrel!Millenium... barely a sci-fi movie. Would you give a Kris Kristoferson movie more than 1 star?Stargate... OK movie, someone must like it as it now has a lame TV show.Capricorn 1... The only shinging star in the set, mainly due to it's very dated look, and OJ Simpson! What a load hooey, but in a cheesey, fun way. Without this movie, I would only give the collection 1 star!Save your money. These movies can be bought seperately for less."
4,excellent story line,"I really liked this movie when I first saw it , then again I had to watch it again to understand what I thought I first missed , then realized I didnt lol .Its a interesting theory about the plane crashes and time travel of course this could only be done in a movie , because if this happens in real life , we're all in trouble !A must see film go out and rent it or buy it !"
3,"Great idea for a story, not very well done","This is one of those movies you wish had real actors, a serious budget, and hadn't gone through four directors (it did) before making it to the screen. Nonetheless, it's one of the best bad sci-fi movies ever.It has an awesome premise, but everything else was just completely wrong. The special effects range between laughable and breath-taking. The music is alternately appallingly inappropriate and wonderful.I really wish someone would remake it, like maybe J.J. Abrahms, give it a real edge. The story is worthy."
4,Shipping was as much as the product (almost),"My daughter wanted this for Christmas and thought I would save time... however I did not save money on shipping. Next time I will go to Walgreens.The product itself is wonderful, everything by Burts Bees is great"
4,Here before I knew it.,I ordered this for my mom for Christmas and they said at least 14 days. I think it was delivered within 3. I was very impressed and my mom seemed to like it. But next time I'd just buy it from a store because the shipping was a rip off.
3,"A decent gift, but could have been better","I purchased this for my mother last x-mas, and she was far more excited about the emergency-car-escape tool that can easily fit on her key chain. A much better gift would be something from L'Occitane, as that gift (for someone else) was remarked on several times. Bees are nice, but go for the octane."
4,Burt's Bees delivers,"I really liked this product, the only thing I was disappointed in was the lip balm. It has Honey in it and gives off an odd odor. I prefer the lip balm with mint in it."
5,Great gift,"I bought this kit as a gift for my mother when I visited the USA in 2006, and she absolutely loved it - as did my sister and the rest of my family.If you're looking for a gift, look no further than this!"
3,I didn't get the right product,"I liked the kit I received. It was for a gift to my mother. I thought I ordered the head to toe kit but instead they sent me the head to toe starter kit. I just gave it to my mother because her birthday was the next day, but was disappointed about not getting the right product."
1,Don't bother with this company!,"I ordered for Christmas on Dec. 11. Never heard back. Checked in just before Christmas, was told item shipped Dec. 21. Never received it. Then I got another email saying it was shipped. (a 2nd shipping date) I still never received it. Then I got an email saying it was backordered and would be shipped in 3 weeks. I gave up and asked for my money returned. Then I received it a few days after that. Jan. 12. A month later!!"
3,"Good Product, bur not what pictured","I love Burts Bees and was happy to recieve my package in the mail. I was a little confused when I open it up. It was not what was pictured at all. That said, the products that did come where great. I love the milk and honey body lotion and the shampoo has a nice scent. The shipping was a little high, but fast. I got the order in 3 days. Next time I will probably buy the stuff at a store because of the shipping, but the products are great."
2,Not for men,"Although I have never used this particular package, I have had experience with many of the products in it, and other products by Burt. The one thing I have found consistent among all of these products is that they put out an odor that is repulsive to all males exposed to it. My male friends, family, and complete strangers have all been put off by this scent. Though the women who use it love both the scent and the effects. Just a word of warning for any person who is considering getting this for a man."
1,not what the image portrayed,This order from Amazon made me angry!! the image was large looking and includes 3 bars of soap. Ha Ha Amazon thanks alot no time to return before christmas I will not order products from Amazon again.I got a tiny box of tiny samples. I will not order on line at Amazon again!!! Joy
3,The image of product ordered was not what I received...,The vendor stated that Burt's Bees changes their Head to Toe package frequently. In any case didn't have an opportunity to send back and wound up keeping. Burt's ee's has great products.
3,Nice & Compact,"This was a birthday gift for my friend. She liked the product and told me it would be great for travel because of the size. We both buy Burt's Bees products and are happy. I was a little disappointed because the product arrived after my friend's birthday. I wish the Head to Toe Starter Kit added more volume to the products, the kit reminds you of samples. Maybe that's the point. All in all this was a good gift."
4,Not quite as expected,I ordered this as part of my mother's christmas gift and I was a little dissapointed in the packaging that it arrived in. The items are also a little smaller than I expected. The products are very nice but I expected more for what I paid.
2,"high shipping, slow delivery, wonderful product",I bought the burt bee lip balm a while back and thought a sample kit would be best so I could try a little of a lot of them. The shipping was three times the product and expidited meant delayed shipping. Next time I will go to Target and save my money and get it faster.
5,Nice gift,"I bought this as a gift for my sister after she had surgery on her mouth. I thought she would want something to pamper herself, but she is not all that girly-girly, and it's not like she could eat a treat after her surgery.She called to tell me she loved it and really appreciated it. She healed up well and fast, and I like to think pampering herself had something to do with it."
3,Burt's Bees Starter Kit,I purchased this item as a gift so I'm not too sure what the products are like!
3,Not crazy about it,"I won it so the price was right, but I can live without the product. Maybe the lip balm I will purchase sometime."
3,You'd think a book on editing would be edited...,"For a book that cost me $93.00, I was expecting something wonderful. Instead I found three blatant editing errors (one of which would have easily been corrected had someone hit ""spell check"" before sending it to the printers) within the first couple of chapters, and more as I went on. The book was boring, badly edited, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,10' x 14' Two Room Cabin with Awning and Fly Cover,This tent did not hold up well. The floor got a rip fairly soon even with just one responsible adult using it. This past summer it pretty much deteriorated and we had to throw it away.
5,A grown woman addicted to DB(Z/GT),I like to counter a previous review saying that DB(Z/GT)is not for girls. I am a 21 year old woman and I love it. I started reading the manga when I was a girl then watched the anime. At first I ignored the serie thinking it was too 'boyish' but the fanfics about Bulma and Vegeta changed that. I watch DBGT once a week now and cant wait til it gets to the Baby part.
1,Dragon Ball GT alittle too LATE!!!,"I was a big fan of the DBZ series i started watching back when cartoon network started putting them on...year after year us true dbz fans waited for new episodes and they didn't come it took then about 6 years after i started watching they finnaly got it together and put out someting that should have been put out many years ago DBGT... but why Funimation is killing the DBZ/GT name i saw the first episode on cartoon network then i saw it at my cousins house....it sucked... about 2 years ago i was still a dbz fan but Funimation took way too long in getting out the Cell saga and Buu saga that most DBZ fan watching from the early days lost intrest we found BETTER animes like AKIRA, Gundam Sagas,and many more.... ALOT DBZ fans will not enjoy this the only DBZ fans that will are the ones that started watching 2 or 3 years ago... i think it sucks and its not worth giving your money to Funimation because they screwed up a good anime name!"
1,DraGONbALLz Sucks Sailor moons alot better,I hate drangonballz its to boyish for me. If your a girl then don't get this its way to boyish for me. Sailor moon is the greatest girl anime next to sakura wars.
3,Sabin series,"I purchased this book because I love Linda Howard's character Kell Sabin. I have read the first two in the series (which I loved) and this is the fourth. I had hoped Sabin would've had a bigger role in this book but that wasn't the case. The story flowed well and didn't take long to read. Jay was very devoted to ""Steve"" and his recovery even though she hadn't seen her ex-husband in years. I admired this but at times she seemed a bit naive about information she was given by the feds especially because she was introduced as a very capable business woman at the beginning of the book.Kell Sabin booksMidnight RainbowDiamond BayHeartbreakerWhite Lies"
3,"Not amazing, but at least very good.","Linda Howard has obviously developed greatly as an author since this book's original publishing in 1988.I liked the concept of the story. Jay is a woman who is devoted to her work and little else. She was married once, to the adventurous (yet wishy-washy) Steve, and thinks of him very little...until the FBI shows up to announce that Steve is critically injured, and that Jay is needed to identify her comatose former husband. As Steve recovers his strength but not his memory, Jay begins to fall in love all over again-with his bravery and spirit, and eventually with his intensity and desire. He is nothing like the Steve she used to know...so who exactly IS he now?I was compelled and fascinated with the development of the story, even though it doesn't contain the raw sexuality and character interest of Howard's later works. This book is okay, and you'll enjoy it for a light read on a Sunday afternoon!"
5,EXCELLENT,"Linda Howard does not disappoint. This book drew me in from page one to the very end. Although I will say that the ending was a bit abrupt. It seemed to be building to an explosive conflict but suddenly: ""It's over. We got him."""
5,White Lies,"This book was exceptionally well written. I have truly enjoyed reading Miss Howard's novels, and plan to read as many of them as possible. Her scenarios are believable, and she takes the time to make sure that your interest is sparked from the first page to the last."
3,"Ok, but Somewhat Disappointing","I borrowed this book from the library recently based on reviews that I read here. Although the book was reasonably interesting and the storyline was good, I thought that the book didn't go into enough depth and didn't do justice to the potential of the storyline. I would have liked to have been given more details about what happened prior to where the story started. I would have liked more details on the villain and the circumstances. I also felt that the book skipped a lot of details at the end of the book by skipping what should have been the climax of the book. I've read other reviews on here and it seems that Linda Howard can write some really good books. Based on the fact that this book was written in 1988, and that I found it to be reasonably enjoyable, I will try some of this author's newer books and see if I enjoy them. If you're looking for a quick, light read with plenty of steamy scenes, you might enjoy this book."
3,Did I read the same book as everyone else?,"I love Linda Howard. Most of her books keep me riveted.""White Lies"" was good, but nowhere as good as some of her others. ""Son of the Morning"" and ""All the Queen's Men"" come to mind for starters. I enjoyed the book, but it was just to simple to really get involved in. Jay and Steve were adorable, but the rest of the story was almost nonexistent."
3,Intriguing but thin plot,"My second Linda Howard book and although the plot was intriguing and kept me reading just fit all the pieces together, I thought that story was pretty thin and full of holes. The focus was in the relationship tension and build up between the two main characters, so that was good. The book rather reminded me somewhat of Sandra Brown's The Witness (another hero with amnesia) and Chill Factor (set in a secluded cabin in the mountains during the winter), both are much better romantic suspense thrillers in my view."
1,Please help the misinformed publisher!!!,The publisher who published this version has taken a copyrighted photograph of the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City for this books cover. Not only is the photo copyrighted but the photo has nothing to do with this book. The publisher clearly never read the book nor took the time to find out what it was about before republishing it.
4,Rev. Timothy Wright Does It Again!!!,"This is a great album from start to finish! You'll get instant energy when ""For The Rest of My Life"" comes on! So go and get the album, you'll be blessed."
5,Pamper yourself.,"Here's a generous supply of Bigelow Herbal Teas. Not a bad one in the bunch! If you've enjoyed Bigelow Herbal Tea before, you know this is a wonderful buy. If you've never tried it, you are in for a treat. Relax and enjoy."
5,very nice,"But the color is much darker than the picture ,it i snot light blue it is very dark blue .easy and comfortable for everyday use .very nice eraser easy to use .looks very nice too."
1,Size matters!,"Brush is not dense enough or long enough to clean wheels. Did an extremely poor job, i had to clean them again they came out that bad. A total waste of money."
5,Great product,"The rims on my new car had many spokes, when buying a new sponge and wash i saw this product and gave it a shot. This product works great, especially for the price - you can't go wrong. It made washing my rims much easier and kept me cleaner! Would highly recommend."
3,Works well but...,"Very good at cleaning wheels, but, let it dry thoroughly before you put it away or the animal hide used will disintegrate."
2,No crinkle here!,"I bought this toy for my 4 month old twins who just became interested in squishing toys that make noise. I bought this and a few other ""crinkle"" toys. However, when I got this I quickly realized this is not a ""crinkle"" toy...there is no crinkle...just a little rattle on the end. So far, they haven't shown much interested in this...even at almost 6 months of age. I threw it in their diaper bag since it is small and I needed some travel toys, but other than that...they don't care for it much. Not sure why the name is ""crinkle"" when there is no crinkle!"
2,boring,My son thinks this toy is boring. He started playing with it at about 4 months. He likes to chew on it for a couple minutes then he gets bored.
1,"""crinkle""???","crinkle? i must be missing something...this toy does NOT ""crinkle"". it has a small rattle, which is fine but it is not what i thought I was buying. I thought it was actually one of the crinkle-noise toys. My granddaughter has a crinkle book which she loves so I ordered this Mini Tinkle Crinkle. But, alas, there is no ""crinkling' in this one. Am actually curious as to why it was even has the work ""crinkle"" in it's name,"
3,Rattle problems,"I bought this item for my 3 month old daughter. On first look it is a perfect size for little hands and colors are nice and bright, but rattle does not work."
2,Not what I expected,"This item was not at all what I expected. It was very small, and looked more like a dog toy than for a baby. It had a rattle in the tail, but did not crinkle at all. I don't know why they call it a ""tinkle crinkle"". I am definitely not satisfied with the overall product."
3,This movie has a pretty good story line and romance,"This movie starts out with a young Don johnson coming to this small town and getting a job at a car dealership. He falls for a very young Jennifer connelly. Don Johnsons boss has a very attractive wife that plays games with him and blackmails him. This movie has the good title ""Hot Spot""for a reason and I bet when you see it you will agree."
3,Awfull! But?,"This pretty awfull, mean spirited movie is a must see for several reasons the primary being Virginia Madsen's portrayal of the quintessential bad girl. Her relentless pursuit of her desires make for some rewarding film voyerism. The scene in which Don brings her husband's hat to her and ends with Virginia standing on the stairway balcony telling a bewildered Don that he is a ""Bad, Bad Boy"" is a gem. This movie reminds me of ""Gotham"" in which Tommy Lee Jones substitutes for Don as Virginias prey and has a scene in which Tommy is informed that she is a woman with very expensive tastes and that she ""can handle a thief and a liar and most any type of criminal but will not tolerate a man wearing a hundred dollar suit"" leaving tommy to examine his off the rack threads. Jennifer Connelly's wholesome beauty provides great contrast to Virginia's bad girl in Hot Spot and the movie has perhaps the best closing line of all time; ""Well I finally found my level, and I'am living it""."
3,Hot Spot,"Director Dennis Hopper Kept This Movie On The Tame Side...Don Johnson Is Semicomatose As A Lowlife Who Drifts Into A Small, Nothing To Do Town...He Robs The Local Bank And Gets Involved With Two Women, One Bad (Virgina Madsen), And One Innocent (Jennifer Connelly)...Connelly Plays Her Character Well With Charisma And Charm...Good Acting With A Restrictive Director, This Film Has The Potential To Be A Great Deal More..."
1,Hot Spot: Not!,"Third-rate at best. Amateurish editing and direction, pointless shots, aimless scenes, high-school dialogue. Virginia Madsen gives it her all in an idiotic role. For fans of Jennifer Connelly's spectacular bosom, it is utterly wasted here in a static, poorly arranged shot."
4,Interesting,"This is an interesting, if not sleazy portrait of Don Johnson as a small time hustler and literal ""used car"" salesman out for the BBD(Bigger,Better,Deal)Simultaneously waltzing the town pump,town bank,town virgin, and town porn king, Don goes from one bad thing to another. I have to say that Jennifer Connnelly-although in a limited role, is breathtaking as the town ingenue. There is just the right touch of confusion and mytery here to make this an enjoyable and provocotive movie."
4,Erotic movie! Great acting. Good score.,"Don Johnson is so good-looking in this movie - but I think he smokes in almost every scene, which takes away from his attractiveness. Virginia Madsen was absolutely wonderful and played the part to perfection and was very erotic! Good movie, but a lot of sex! I loved the score - it was great."
3,solid modern noir,"This film didn't get much box office when it was released. Hopper blamed some of that on Don Johnson not hyping the film on the marketing circuit a'la talk shows, etc...In any case, it was a solid plot/acting/direction job. Connelly is totally believable as the innocent yet sensual small town girl. Was that really Virginia Madsen? Ever since Sideways, I just look at her in a totally different way from her appearance in The Hot Spot.Basically, just a nice little film."
3,Film Noir makes a valient comeback attempt,"Don Johnson and Virginia Madison pull every dirty trick in the book in this zesty bad boy meets bad girl story of lust in a town with nothing to do. Throw in a seemingly innocent ingénue to complicate the hate-need-hate relationship between Johnson and Madison and you've got a movie demonstrating just how rotten people can be. However, it's not entirely painful to watch has some good one-liners, and advice for how to scheme, commit murder, mayhem, and other assorted thuggary and get away with it."
4,Great if you like Blues.....,"I loved Miami Vice for its great music, and would have to say I loved this film for the same reason, but definitely nothing more! I read somewhere that Don Johnson went back to acting school after this film. I think this is an over-reaction: the film isn't that bad. At no point was I bored. The plot has one or two nice twists, and apart from the shot of Don Johnson's naked butt (yuk!) I thought the film was OK. But nothing more than OK.So why the 4 stars? Because if you like blues, the soundtrack to this movie is great! I play the CD a lot, and have sat through the video of the film several (3, I think) times, to get into the atmosphere associated with this music."
4,"Movie is OK, music is great if one likes ""proper"" blues","I read this week that Don Johnson's career was almost destroyed by this film. I can't think why, because although the story is not great, and we have to put up with seeing his naked butt once or twice, the film as a whole is not too bad. And for anyone who likes blues, the sort played by John Lee Hooker, the soundtrack is excellent, virtually throughout. I don't rate Don Johnson that highly as an actor, since, for instance, Sonny Crockett and Nash Bridges strike me as being the same character (based in different cities), but he is not bad, and that he should be panned for trying to do something different, like this film, seems unfair to me. If you like blues, watch this film."
2,Eh . . .,"I bought it for Jennifer Connelly's chest, I got that and quite an eyeful of Virginia Madsen, and what this all boils down to is that Dennis Hopper directed this movie. Seeing as how he did so many drugs in his time, that would explain why this movie makes woefully little sense.But hey, I got what I paid for. It's not like I was expecting an Oscar-winning effort here. But, oh, did my head hurt."
2,Just under-rating Texas (except for Jennifer Connelly),"I live in Texas for 15 years and this is my home. The movie is empty, meaninless and just a waste of time. Jennifer Connelly is an exception, as her play (an in many other films) indicates an actress in a growing process towards the Oscar she won, well deserved at least, with a Beautiful Mind in 2002.Would you wish to see Connelly mastering? Please watch Waking the Dead.It is so much deeper, meaninful, no comparison at all.Texas is an wonderful place. Its traditions, its way of thinking, has nothing to do with this movie.And yes... Jeniffer... You deserve so much better."
1,A Waste Of Good 35mm Film,"This is a confusing, sweaty mess of a film, that tries to be a sexy story of southern seduction, and turns into nothing more then a tribute to the heat and humidity of the south. If not for the tallent (and body) of Jennifer Connelly, this movie would be a total waste"
3,Nice read about Islam.,"Not scholarly. Not polemical. Just some interesting, reasonably balanced, apparently sensitive personal observations about Islam. The only question I have is does an ex-Submitter of Turkish descent have the same perspective on the House of Submission as an Arab Submitter? Of course, that's always the problem with personal observation which is why the book rates three stars.A note on one-star reviews. I've found that if you check other reviews by one-star reviewers, if the book strongly supports their position, it gets five stars. If the book lightly contradicts or even mildly questions their position, it gets one-star."
3,Basic overview,"If you don't know anything at all about Islam, this is a great book. It gives the basic facts about the religion, its history, and its implications in current events. It has excellent ideas for people who want to witness to their Muslim acquaintances as well. Keep in mind, though, that the information is very, very basic. If you really want to be well-informed about Islam, you should probably try another book."
5,An Excellent Book,"Both belief systems are Monotheistic, but by comparing the God of the Koran and the God of Bible you find that Muslims and Christians worship an entirely different God.The Caner Brothers have done an excellent job explaining the distinction between the beliefs of Islam and Christianity. They give an honest, direct, and unbiased explanation of the religion of Islam. As former Muslims, they understood the message of Islam in the Koran and the Hadith."
1,ehh....they actually published this?,This was an illogical diatribe on Islam. The writer clearly has an anti-Islam agenda that refuses to separate politics from the basics tenants of the religion. Constant comparisons to Christianity were not necessary but form the basis of `righteousness' that is the measuring stick here. I expected the book to get to the heart of the cultural and religious reasons why Islamic thought is anti-western in some respects but there is no such discussion here. I know enough to know that the next time I spill a cup of coffee on my desk and a rag is absent.......I will reach for pages starting in chapter one.
1,Why....???,"We live in a complicated world made up of a myriad of societies and peoples with influences beyond our comprehension and grasp. Today, people living in the world's most developed nation diagnose a psychotic killer's reason for slaying 15 people as being slapped by his father when he was 7... yet we dont even try to understand how it might be for a child growing up with his parents killed in front of his eyes, his siblings mutilated and raped... because we have no reason to put ourselves in their shoes considering we have our comfy armchairs to sit back in and venture an opinion...Islam as a religion like every other religion in the world has endevoured to teach its followers a higher standard of moral and spiritual life. People who need to know more about any religion.... including Islam should go back to the basics, reach out and get a copy of the translation of the Quran and find out for themselves what its all about."
1,Littered With Convenient Omissions,"Here we go again. This author, who writes about Islam, converted from it (not to it), at the age of twelve. The author also cannot speak Arabic. This book leaves out the Suras 5, 9, and 14, the chapters that promote violence against Infidels, defined as any and all people who practice other religions, or no religion at all. This is another attempt to make a quick buck because of the increased interest in the violent, hate-filled religion known as Islam. If you want to learn more about this particular religion, there are many other books to choose from.Like the religion, this book is for the gutter."
1,Insider??? Only half an insider! maybe a quarter...,"It is a must read for those who want to justify their hatred to muslims!If you want to read a book which is not going to change your mind about muslims, read this book.The mother of the authors is Swedish, still Christian. So, at most they are half insider! But off course, labeling it as ""an half-insider's look.."" wouldn't promote it so much!Only their name implies something islamic... that's it. They were born in Sweden and America, lived their entire life in the west, experienced a broken family. And found a warm friendship when in very need of it. This led to their exagerated conversion (fireworks!) Their contact with islam is one ounce more than any American. What kind of insider is that? Actually they are regular johnnies.Guaranteed salvation that is emphasized in the book is the cause of world's-champion-crime-rate in US. You are blessed but don't attempt to walk outside after 11 o'clock!"
1,This guy is complete liar,this guy was never a Muslim go watch his stupid fake video about being Muslim on youtube he is a liar hating something is fine (keep it to yourself) but at least be fair
1,"Very, very biased",This book is very biased. It does not present the whole and correct picture of Islam and appears that these brothers misunderstand the Quran.
1,a reader,An attempt to write for some who want to read this. No in depth research or discussion is provided in the book. The authors have shared thier perspective which seems to be scewed based on thier conversion.
1,Crazy Right Wing Nuts,"wow, i must say, after reading this book i am in great shock. This is just another stab at spreading mass and false propaganda by Conservative Loonies to try and scare the public into hating the the misunderstood, hating the unknown, hating islam. Look at your selves, your the reason 9/11 happend, not Islam. You make fun of another persons religion, and they are obviously going to get angry, as an athiest a mock all religions, but i HATE it when one relgion things they are superior over another religion, all religions are the same, they lead to wars and blood shed, 10 thumbs down for this book of evil"
1,A thinly-veiled criticism of Islam by Christian converts,"I bought this book hoping to achieve a better understanding of the religious concepts behind Islam -- an important consideration in today's environment of religious and cultural conflict, where we need to achieve understanding in order to build a peaceful future. Instead what I found was a thinly-veiled criticism of Islam point-by-point in comparison to Christian values. The authors are converts to Christianity who note an Islamic precept and then condemn it as inferior to Christian views. I read about 20 pages and then threw it away. This is by no means a balanced view of a religion and is NOT to be recommended to anyone who hopes to learn about Islam from an open-minded approach. So I went shopping again, and I do recommend the Idiot's Guide to Islam as being easy to read, understand, and very factual...and with no missionary overtones."
1,Not what it appears,"I bought this book hoping to gain a better understanding of the politics and culture of Islam. However, this book shouldn't be called ""Unveiling Islam"" but ""Exposing Islam for the Infidel Religion It Really Is."" This book simply promotes horrible stereotypes about Muslims: they're *supposed* to beat their wives, their God is a hateful God, etc. The authors are biased, despite their own upbringing as Muslims and their vitriol is offensive. The book also is a Christian religious tract, trying to convert us to their beliefs. If you're interested in learning more about Islam buy a different book, because you won't learn anything true from this one."
1,Bias and deceptive,"- It's a cultural tirade, a superficial piece at best that doesn't take into consideration even a drop of truth about Islam- Mostly conjecture-and-assumption based argumentation fueled by their own ignorance of the faith- The authors take unauthentic Hadith and out-of-context passages in the Qur'an and twist them at their own whim- Pontificates Christian values through a duplicitous intertextual discourse- Their description of jihad was as far from the truth as anything in this piece- The opinions of any of the reputable Islamic scholars are, not surprisingly, absent in this warped textSave your money and just read a copy of the Holy Qur'an for free online. (Try Quranexplorer.com) All the guidance and knowledge is right there, people. I'll recommend Surahs Fatiha, Furqan, Maryam, and Yusuf. They are excellent passages in our history, and are very poetic, too."
4,enlighting,"easy to understand,opens the door to a better understanding on a subject we all schould begin to realize is around us."
4,Unveiling Islam:An Insider's Look at Muslim Life & Beliefs,"I feel the book was written by someone who was once a Muslim. In writing this book, as the title implies, he is giving the reader a chance to see what the Islam faith is all about. He does not do it maliciously but from a comparative religion angle."
1,Ann Coulter's favorite book on Islam,"Go to www.anncoulter.org...you'll find out that the Nazi femme fatale of the Republican party (who calls liberals traitors) is endorsing this book on her links page.THAT should tell you how objective this book is in depicting Islam.Don't but this book...rather contact various scholars in Islam near you, and ask them what they would recommend. Take their recommendations, and read them."
1,All you need to know about this book...,"This is one of the books Ann Coulter lists on her website under the link ""Reading for Right-Wingers"".That should be enought for anyone to know what this book is all about.."
4,haven't read book yet,"i haven't read the book yet, but i recently heard Ergun Cnaer speak and he gave his testimony. it was perful and compelling. He is a very intelligent and knowledgeable man, who is very humble. If ever you have the opportunity to hear him speak, take advantage of it and listen to him."
1,The author is judging a religion based on what?,"""Once I saw a Muslim kid take away an apple from a baby! Beware! Islam supports the stealing of apples from babies!""Okay maybe I'm taking this a little too far, but you get the picture. He is basing a religion followed by at least 1.2 billion people, on what a minority of its followers do. He is criticizing the view of Islam that is followed by radical extremists.We all can criticize them(muslim extremists) in many ways just as we can criticize Fallwell, but when it comes to criticizing the religion of Islam itself, the author fails miserably. Maybe I should write a book disproving this book....shouldn't be too hard( and im not even a muslim scholar!)"
1,The work of children,"I seriously question the credibility of these authors. They were twelve when they converted to Christianity, hardly old enough to know anything about puberty, much less enough to know anything about Islam. Judging from their book, their ignorance has not improved since then--their ""insider's"" look is as rudimentary and childlike as any twelve year old's understanding of a religion would be."
1,Sick,Sick and disgusting. Islam is not necessarily the best religion but it isn't evil. ANY religion can be portrayed as evil. It is all from your perspective. THis book has a biased author. Obviously someone who converted to anothe religion from Islam is not going to speak to higly of it. Look for more of a historical and informative book. Not an opinion.
5,Unveiling Islam,The Caner brothers did a wonderful job explaining what the Islamic religion is all about. The Caner brothers were dedicated Islamist for many years and for anyone to try and debate the truth in what they wrote is plainly in denile.
1,Just another anti-Islam book out there .. nothing special,"Just for someone to self-proclaim that he/she is, or was a Muslim, that doesn't make him a Muslim. These authors were never Muslims as their leader, Atatürk.Do yourself a favour and know more about Islam from the source. Don't waste time with this useless material.For those who are serious about knowing what's Islam and why many people like these authors dedicated their lives to fight Islam, I recommend the following book: The Holy Quran with a good authentic explaination such as Tafsir Ibn Kathir ([...]).. trust me, it will be an eye-openner for you."
5,Very informative and human book.,"This book is easy to read and yet quite full of information. This is not strictly a theology book. It is actually a fairly ""hands-on"" type book. This book is not an attack on Islam, but a help for those that want to understand Islam and their Muslim friends. I believe that anyone reading this book will find at least one section helpful in their understanding of Islam and its followers. The section that has helped me the most is ""The Bible from a Muslim Perspective"". The authors show how the Koran actually speaks rather highly of the Bible."
1,An agenda piece...,"I read this book after it was recommended to me by a pastor at a local church. I am a rather prolific reader of theology, so it didn't take long to see that this was neither a theologically sound or scholarly look at Islam. The authors either have a poor grasp of Islam, or they chose to pick bits and pieces to reinforce their bias, which is evident on every page. This book is intended to assist Christian evangelicals in approaching Muslims, but it is more harmful than helpful. Muslims will ask ""If your knowledge of my religion is based on half-truths and lies, how can I be sure that what you tell me about yours is the truth?"" My advice for evangelicals...stick to works by reputable scholars and investigate their background and their agenda before you buy into what they are saying. I recommend ""The Heart of Islam"" by Nasr and ""101 questions about Islam"" by Renard for the basics. Skip this pablum."
2,Not well-written,"I was very interested to learn more about the Muslim faith and was somewhat dissapointed with information conveyed. The authors have a bias being former Muslims who converted to Christianity. I found the book to be not well-organized nor well-written. The information is not presented in any logical format. While I did learn something about the Muslim faith, the authors could have done a much better job."
5,Wonderful,I agree with many other reviewers this is a wonderful book. Islam in a nutshell. You don't have to wade through lengthy descriptions to obtain the core information. It would be wonderful to find books like this on other religions.
4,Get the Facts About Islam,This book provides a knowledgeable overview of Islam's core beliefs and an enlightening comparison between the Islamic and Western worldviews.
1,What a let down..,"This was a very disappointing and frustrating work to digest. I happen to have read it while on vacation in Turkey no less.The brothers never bother to explain how or why they came to be born again, and why their father disowned them. Basically everything that was bad that happened to them was do to Islam.The illustrations they use of how it is impossible to get on with Muslim neighbors are comical and stereotypical.Furthermore, instead of unveiling Islam they choose to tear it apart, which of course is fine if that is the point of the book, but they do it poorly.THey do not even do a very good job of selling Christianity either, everything is just rather vague. It is obvious in the reading who their intended audience is."
1,Not worth a single solitary dime.....,"I wanted to be challenged. I'm not an Islamic scholar, but I still wanted this book to surprise me. It didn't. I could already disprove this book myself.But there were some things that struck me, which I later found out was taken out of context. Funny, how they attempt to decieve people out of a religion.Basically, if you hate Islam, you will like this book regardless of its content. If you like Islam, this could be a joke. If you want a honest approach, what can be better than the Quran(and make sure you get the official one too, i recommend (yusuf ali)].Other books I would recommend is;Unholy War: Terror in the name of Islam.Idiot's guide to the Understanding of IslamOr better yet, buy the DVD/VHS ""Muhammad; Legacy of a Prophet"" You won't need any other book(other than the Quran of course) if you watch this."
1,Unvieling Islam???(Please Read),"This book is quite biased. And does a horrible job in protraying Islam. As a student who has studied Islam at a University I am quite upset that such a biased book is getting so much publicity. But i do understand that we are free to speak as we will. So For anyone truly trying to see Islam as it is I recommend not reading this book. Instead there are many other books that can be read. For example ""The Vision of Islam"" by Sachiko Murata &William C. Chittick, ""Muhammad"" by Martin Lings , and ""The Toa of Islam"" by Sachiko Murata."
1,Nothing but ignorant stereotypes,"The subtitle should read ""An Outsider's look at Islam though ignorant stereotypes."" I get the impression that everything the Caners know about Islam was learned from anit-Islamic tracts. It is worse than useless because it misinforms the reader. There is nothing about it that gives the impression that the Caner brothers have any first-hand knowledge of what it really means to be Muslim. An excellent introductory level correction to their errors is found inWho Speaks For Islam?: What a Billion Muslims Really Thinkby Esposito and Mogahed which reports the results of over 50,000 hours of careful polling of Muslims by Gallop. It is a must read it the Caners' book has infected your mind."
3,Candlestick Review,A different approach to looking a candlesticks. Looking more at patterns than individual candlesticks for buy or sell setups. It was worth getting.
4,The Treehouse Book,The book was very well writen. It was very descriptive and I would reccomend the book for anyone who wants to design a treehouse. It was packed full of information. I would read over and over again. It's really a great book.
4,inspiring,"I bought The Treehouse Book as a gift, but couldn't resist reading it myself. It definitely made me want to build a tree house for my five year old son. He enjoyed the book as well. I wouldn't consider it a ""how to"" book - I purchased it for my brother, who builds custom homes. I do think it could inspire a higher level of creativity in many who read it, as some of the treehouses are flat out amazing!"
4,The Treehouse Book,Well wriiten and thoughtfully illustrated.It is always interesting to see an author who is essentially practical try to balance substance and imagination. In this case; a good effort.
1,Save your dollars!! Didn't work,"I read the other reviews that said it didn't work and I thought, well it's only a couple of bucks so I'll give it a try. Well, it was a waste of a couple of bucks - I could have had a latte and enjoyed it much, much more. Product didn't work at all!!"
2,Good while it lasted.,"Worked well for about a month, would charge somewhat quickly. Until about 3 weeks in the tab to pull out the charger plug from the phone would not work so well. After about 2 days I plugged the charger back into the phone and I tried later to take it out when I took it out the charge plug that went into the phone, the charger's plug fell apart."
1,TRUTH IN SELLING,"I was very disappointed with the product. The would only play half thru and then stick. Tried everything to correct it, All to no avail. In fairness the shipping time and timeliness was excellent."
3,RIPPED OFF...,"THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM. NO QUESTION - VERY CLEAN IN SACD FORM. BUT! IT IS IN STEREO FORMAT ONLY. THERE IS NO HI-RES MULTICHANNEL FORMAT HERE. I AM NONE TO HAPPY ABOUT THAT. AMAZON WILL NOT LET ME RETURN IT, ALTHOUGH IT WAS IN MY SACD PLAYER FOR LESS THAN A MINUTE. SACD'S SHOULD OFFER 2 CHANNEL STEREO AND MULTICHANNEL HI-RES TRACKS. MY BASIC CD VERSION SOUNDS THIS GOOD AND I CAN DUMP IT INTO DTS NEO;6 ETC FOR A SURROUND ENVIRONMENT. BUT NOT WITH THIS SACD VERSION...."
2,there is much better willie than this,"This album may have made him a star, but in my opinion this is weak compared to others. You cannot compare this disc to phases and stages or red headed stranger. These are willie nelson classics. this disc is just classics performed by willie. Pass on this disc and please pick up phases and stages and red headed strangers. If you want a very good disc from him in the 90's, pick up spirit. It too is very good, by rather mellow."
2,vintage Willie.,"Some of the better Willie recordings. He does seem to ""fudge"" a little bit on pitch, which is not a fatal problem."
1,ATTN: Audiophiles who don't listen carefully...,It seems that my crtique of Amazon was taken as a swipe against Willie Nelson's crisp clear & uncompressed stereo sound. (Good heavens) My beef here was about Amazon's lack of info. with regards to stereo/multi & single/double layer. I don't have a 50k sound system but at least I can read carefully.
1,willie sings show tunes,"ok show tunes is a stretch but Look no further if you want to hear willie sing your favorite songs out of tune and out of time. I love willie but come-on this ones crap, my dad who loves show tunes, gave it back! I love country music, grew up listening to tubbs, owens, cash, snow, miller, wills, jennings, haggard, and nelson. This ones been pinned on my wall of shame, right next to john tesh. If you want to listen to country versions of popular songs save your money and buy lyle lovett, at least he's on key. Or better yet get some real willie, buy shotgun willie or red headed stranger...oh so cruel..."
5,Out of this World!,"I want to thank the artist for such a wonderful rendition of these songs. It was my favorite CD upon my first listening of it. Entertaining, calming, fun, and takes me back to a different time."
5,Great Gift Item,I bought this for my sister who is a Willie Nelson fan and had a hard time finding the CD. She loves it!
4,Hooray for Willie,"Willie Nelson is one of the greatest American songwriters of all time. Who did they save for last on the WTC celebrity fund raiser? That's right, Willie. This album is one of the reasons for all the reverence and acclaim. Done a good thirty some years into his career Willie proved that he has never lost a note, in fact he has only gotten better with time. Willie may have had to work harder than most of Americas great songwriters to gain respect because he is considered a country artist. Hearing him do classics like Georgia on my Mind, Blue Skies and Stardust should prove to even the most causual of listeners that the red headed stranger is for real."
3,CD version sounds better!,"I own the CD of this great album and just recently bought the SACD version. After having read all the positive reviews I thought this might be a good showcase album for the SACD format but after comparing the CD with the SACD I feel disappointed. Willie's voice on the SACD has some rough edges to it. Surprisingly, his voice on the CD sounds smoother. SACD's play louder than CD's because they have greater dynamic range - perhaps the engineers set the recording level too high when mastering the SACD version and didn't notice the distortion in Willie's voice (please note: I can only hear this distortion on some tracks and only in certain places where the volume peaks - otherwise the sound is very good)."
1,Pass,"Way too complicated to be helpful. I have the regular Bjorn that my son loves, but it is just too hard on the back to wear for an extended period of time. I thought this design might be a good solution. There were so many areas to adjust on this model that neither my husband nor I could do it easily. It was very difficult to transfer from different sized people. Given that it only goes up to 25 lbs, we returned it and got an Ergo Baby Carrier instead."
4,"So far, so good","While new to parenthood, this item appears to be great so far. Our babe isn't heavy enough to fully assess the benefit of the additional support provided by the active carrier, but it seems to work quite well. In fact, when our little guy was a bit fussy, I put him in the Bjorn and went for a moderately paced walk on the treadmill and he really seemed to like it. Overall, I would recommend this item."
5,the only western carrier my baby agreed to be in!,"tribal carriers are great for him but it's too hot to be in in the Israeli summer.I tried other western carriers but my baby refused to be in them - or they did not support his body properly. the only one both of us liked is this one.plus the color is great, and once i adjusted all the starps, its easy to put on.love it."
3,Baby Bjorn,"The Baby Bjorn active felt very secure and easy to use. The only thing was that it put a lot of pressure on my shoulders, which made them ache. Maybe I wasn't using it correctly?? But, everything else felt good. I think it's a good product, but just not for me."
5,BabyBjorn Active Carrier,Well-received by the new parents who got this as a gift. Just what they wanted!
4,The only sequel worthy of the original!,"Superman is back in this first (and only quality) sequel to the one that started it all. The man of steel is up against 3 villains from his home world who have been trapped in the ""phantom zone"", and all heck breaks loose here on Earth! This movie is packed with great special effects, and one of my most favorite scenes ever in a movie....when the villain Ursul cries out ""Superman"" and proceeds to throw a bus full of people at him. Great camp, a great cast and a true successor to the original. Buy Superman and Superman II, but don't waste your money on the other 3!"
3,videotape-quality recording,"Unlike the DVD release for the first film, Superman II has not been digitally cleaned-up. The quality of the recording is no better than that of video tape. Add the fact that the extra scenes which were restored when released on television over the years are completely absent and a complete lack of extras and you end up with a sub-par package. More than a little disappointing."
3,Great sequel on an O.K DVD...,"Superman 2 is a decent sequel to Superman but does not hold the magic of the original film. This is due to the absence of director Richard Donner who was fired by the Salkinds and replaced by Richard Lester and most of the original cast especially Marlon Brando. Even the music lost it's touch of grandness when they decided to remove John Williams. I saw the TV edit in the late eighties and it featured most of Donner's shot and those shots made Superman 2 more 'Superman'.The Superman 2 DVD was release in such a hurry, we only get a theatrical trailer as an extra. Hopefully one day, Warner will release Donner's cut of the movie with a fair amount of extras. Cross your fingers!"
4,Why treated like a RED HEADED STEPCHILD?,"Why didn't Warner treat this highly regarded sequel with the same respect as SUPERMAN THE MOVIE? Many[and I'm one of them] think this is just as good as the first one. But all we get is a trailer as a specail feature. It being common knowledge that there are tons of outtakes, why didn't we get any, or the expanded version that has shown up on television? I hope Warners rethink their decision and re-release this with the treatment it deserves."
4,Liked It Better Than The Original,"Less campy and kept the action moving. I agree with others that the change at the end was lame, but I can still pretend that the original ending was used. Although I also agree that the ""magic kiss"" was lame. This was fun to watch and I feel the scenes with Brando give it more weight and tie it better in overall theme to the first one. A great movie from my child hood. It was nice to watch it with a different twist."
3,Finally!! Superman II - The Restored International Cut,"There's actually another more complete cut called 'Superman II - Restored International Cut' - a 146 minute cut - which uses footage from the Donner, Lester and the ABC-tv extended cut versions.Check out the details, pics and script dialouge from the re-inserted scenes in the comments below..."
5,The ONLY Superman II there should be,"I just wanna say simply put that if you're a hardcore superman fan, Richard Donner's Superman II IS the sequel to watch. the ORIGINAL SUPERMAN II (Donner's Cut) blows Lester's version out of the water and I will never understand why they didn't use Richard Donner's version of superman II because after all Donner DID to the first one and filmed the 2nd one at the same time so things flow a hell of alot better.. For those hardcore fans out there seeing Richard Lester's Superman II is a waste of time and money.. Superman II: The Richard Donner is THE one to watch.. Like it says on the box... AS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED AND INTENDED!"
5,A Masterpiece and almost as good as Superman 4,"I found this film to be second only to Superman 4. Its a pity that the orignal footage was not included.Hopefully the DvD's of both Superman 2 and 4 will restore the unseen footage. Terence Stamp was the best choice as General Zod and Sarah Doughlas was just as brilliant. This film really tries to make us appreciate Superman being there for us. ""GENERAL WOULD YOU CARE TO STEP OUTSIDE"" ""I'M NOT A COWARD ZOD"" Super!"
2,Completely overHYPED!!!!!!!!,"The version of the second movie was NOT worth it. Sure there were extra scenes with Jor-El, but there was definitive errors in editing. For example, in the end, Superman leaves Lex Luthor in the Fortress of solitude. WTF?!?!?!? Plus, at the end, Superman reverses time like in the first film, but then goes into the diner where he got is butt kicked to fight that guy Rocky; since he turned back time, it actually never happened. Plus, there were plenty of deleted scenes altogether.Don't waste your money!!!! Stick with S1 and S3 (with Pryor)."
1,Disappoint,"I already owned the DVD and I thought if I bought it in Blu-ray Disc it should be fantastic. To my surprise, there is no improvement on picture quality when I play both version on Blu-Ray Player. Extremely disappointed./Pongtorn"
2,A real disappointment,"Okay, I loved the original Superman, and when I saw the Donner extend ended version came out, I was excited. The other sups paled in comparison to the original. So when this version came out, the Donner cut, I figured why rent, the 2nd was good, donner's will even be better, buy it. Wrong. I feel like this dvd cut version was put together in a day. The cuts are bad and abrupt, the effects a cheap. The original, back in the 70/80s are better, and the story itself isn't fleshed out. It just goes from scene to scene, and if you've never seen the film, you would be lost. It's a real shame. I know Donner only filmed a bit, but still, this version is sub par and the ending..um we've seen it, and this time around it's a total cop out. AVOID and see the original 2nd."
3,Great Film; Lousy DVD,"This cut of Superman II is hugely better than the theatrical release. My only complaint is that with the DVD version, the picture quality is quite poor (the quality is better than the DVD version of the theatrical version of Superman II). I would recommend purchasing this film on Blu-Ray or HD-DVD disk."
1,Not worth the effort,"I have been looking forward to viewing the Richard Donner interpretation of Superman II. Now that I've seen it, let's just put this in the bargain bin somewhere, shall we?If this is truly his vision for this film, he was blind. This is disjointed and the flow is destroyed. In the original theatrical release, you laughed because of the humor. With this cut, you laugh AT the movie.This is a total waste of time, except for the geeks who MUST see what was left out."
5,Superman Rocks!!!,This was an excellent film by Richard Donner. I would highly recommend it to anyone that is a Superman fan!
3,It could have been great,"Spoiler alert: First, let me say....I LOVE DONNER! He rocks. I have no doubt this movie would have been hit if Donner had finished what he started. The sad truth is...the movie plays better in Lester's Cut.The Donner Cut did have it's moments. I did liked how Zod and Co. seemed more evil and how Donner's cut removed most of the dubbed-in jokes and one-liners. However, I missed Lester's strong opening with the terrorists/elevator and preferred Lester's answer to how Superman got his powers back. Donner's turning back time was disappointing and left many unanswered questions. Did everyone just forget what happened? Zod's still alive?In short, Donner's verison is interesting, but not as good as the original verison. Rent, don't buy unless your a big Superman/Donner fan!"
2,Richard Lester could have cared less about Superman.,"So many liked Superman II, and yet now that everyone knows that Donner was fired before he had a change to finish the movie( he was hired to make two Superman Movies back to back) this Richard Lester version comes across as hollow and souless and not having much heart to it. Lester is not a great film maker, his one meal ticket was with the Beatles in HARD DAY'S NIGHT, and that was it. He did not know nor care about Superman, he just wanted a pay check and the real loss was the movie going public."
3,Without spoiling the ending...,"...it's a cop-out......and disappointing after waiting all this time for this director's ""vision."" Other than that--there were some things I really liked about this edit.My friends and I howled out loud about some of the inconsistancies created by this rotten ending, though.(...But it was still better than the ""orange drink of forgetfulness."")"
2,Where's the original?,"As has been already stated a lot of the 'new' footage leaves a lot to be desired. Fair enough Donner was aggrieved to have been removed from the film, but this version adds nothing to the movie itself or to Donners reputation. It is simply a marketing exercise to shift more Superman II units. The fact that Lester's original version is not here makes the whole package redundent.This is not the movie from your childhood as many touching scenes are missing and have been replaced needlessly. The new stuff isn't all bad, but the ending is unforgiveable! Imagine children today seeing Superman The Movie and then watching this for the first time. Two movies with the same endings!!!Pointless except as a curiosity."
2,Doesn't hold up,"I saw this film recently, and it just didn't hold up over time. The story is still great, and general Zod rules...but a lot of the movie came across as...cheesey. The scene where Zod and gang terrorize New York was just plane silly, and New York looked like a sound stage. It's too bad, because this was one of my favorite films as a child. Maybe your kids will like it, but as a previous fan...the magic was gone.On a positive note, I saw the Wrath of Khan recently as well, and that movie did hold up!"
1,This movie never would have made it in theaters!,"Although the extra scenes(the most notable of which was a screen test) were interesting, I missed 1)the villainous brute testing his laser-eyes on a snake, 2)Superman dramatically flying-off from the Fortress of Solitude after he's regained his powers, and 3)Lois Lane falling into the river at Niagra Falls. This new version had little continuity, and lacked character development. After spending money on this turkey, I'm forced to do so again on the standard version, which I sorely missed. This version would have been a very nice dvd extra to the standard version...alas, it's a complete waste of money on its own."
4,Definitely a different perspective,"Superman II is a good film as originally released. Donner's version, I think, is a little better as it functions as the second half of a longer movie. Gone are Lester's comedic touches; restored are the Reeve / Brando father-son interactions. On whole, it's good to see what Donner's vision was for the two movie set, and I'm glad he had a chance to complete the project he set out to do."
4,The real Superman II,"I had never seen this version before, and I have to say I like it better that the original. Everything ties into together better.With the HD DVD transfer, its hard to believe this film was made so many years ago. The audio and video are great. If you like Superman, you need this version of Superman II."
1,Give us the Theatrical version on blu-ray please!,"I grew up on this movie, and I love it. Superman 2 was my favorite of the Superman series. In my opinion it was the strongest and most enjoyable, and I believe there are many critics and fans who would agree.I bought this version because the theatrical version was not available on blu-ray, and boy do I regret it. It is nothing like the film I excited to see again (no Eiffel tower sequence, the Niagara sequence is also almost entirely cut). Instead, I got a weak hodgepodge of material that was never intended to go together, or even (some of it) to be seen anywhere but as a deleted scene in the special features menu. It's a novelty, not a film, and more than that, not the film I knew and loved and would like to own. I'm sure there are many people who are glad to finally see the Donner footage, and I'm glad that this makes it available to them, but it is unacceptable as the only version of the best movie of the Superman franchise available on Blu-ray."
4,Best Superman Of All Time,I really enjoyed Richard Donner's version of Superman II. I think it is a lot better than the Theatrical version and storywise it is better than Superman Returns. It is a must see for every Superman fan.
5,Superman II,"They did it! A sequel with the same majesty of the original. Superman II brings the magic and awe of the comic-book hero to our screens in the same, lovable mood as Superman: The Movie. The scenes between Lois and Clark Kent as he tries and tries to persuade her to be with him are compelling. Gene Hackman returning as arch-villan Lex Luthor and Terence Stamp as General Zod make lovable enemies that will make you laugh and cry till the very end. Highly recommended. See it!"
3,Superman II,"I actually enjoyed the First Superman movie more so than this(hold the Brando please),the 2nd one seems more drawn out and even less plausible.(I am aware it is a superman movie,even so.)I do love the Product placement in this one however and that bossybroad hanging out with Zod,What matters most Is Christopher Reeve himself(God Rest his soul)Because Hackman makes a Bad ""Badguy"".Still any Reeve Superman is better than none."
2,MY WORST LOOKING DVD,"Even for such a troubled filled production, Superman II turned out rather well. The villains are excelent but you'll enjoy the fate of the mean truck driver even more.That said this is the worst looking DVD I've ever seen by a long shot. The image is incredibly dull and the sound not much better. Had I only known a new edition which includes Richard Donner's original cut was going to come out late 2006 I would have surely waited. Now I'll have to but this movie again and throw my first copy straight into the garbage."
1,poor review,this product is poorly package when I received it the disc was shaking back and forth. Had to ask for a refund
2,"It's OK, but I prefer Lester's work","SPOILERS: It could be that this film version was made from early cuts and totally unfinished, but two scenes really come out -- I prefer Lester's Eiffel Tower elevator scene that caused the release of the criminals, and the ending of this film is just lame. Though the kiss was a stretch in Lester's film, Donner's turning back time by turning the globe in reverse has no place on any film."
1,Horrible - Don't waste your time,"Donner should be kicked in the groin for making this very dumb version of Superman II. The ending is lame and unoriginal. The re-cuts do not really add anything to make the story better. I am sorry he lost his chance to see his vision make it to the big screen the first time, but he should have left well enough alone. Save your time and effort and stick with the original one you saw in the theaters."
2,Why does everybody love this movie?,"This movie is at best average. It's a violent ""normal"" sequal and as usual can't live up to the original. The original lived up to the comic book and was very faithfull. Christopher Reeve was again great as the man of steal and who could top Gene Hackman. Terrence Stamp was good as General Zod and Sarah Douglass was goods as Ursa but Jack O'Halloran as Non was a wasted and useless character. The great Superman theme by John Williams is still there but as massive and exciting. If you want a good sequel see Superman 3. But only see this if your a die hard fan."
3,Why No ABC Special?,This dvd would be even better with the addition of the scenes that the ABC special had. Why does Warner Brothers not release this version? If anyone has this version please let me know.
1,Not what you think,"If you want to purchase this movie because you like Superman II as it aired way back when, then don't buy this movie. The beginning is COMPLETELY different and I was too irritated to even continue watching past the first 10 minutes. I am now looking to purchase the complete set of all the movies just so I can have the real version of this one."
3,"You might like this, but I didn't...","You might like this version of the classic Superman film, but I didn't. I liked the original. I can't explain why, really, other than to say that certain scenes did not appear dramatic at all even though you knew they should be. Since Superman is such a favorite of mine from many years ago, I got so used to the way I first saw it. This jarred me a bit.Then again, when I saw Amadeus the first time, it was the director's cut with extra scenes. I loved it!! I went out to buy more of Mozart's music right away... yet what would happen if I saw the original version? Would I like that as much as the longer version?Either way, these are great movies depending on which versions you like best.And yes, I do recommend Amadeus very highly!!"
2,"No DTS, No 5.1...................Why Not?","The movie is ok, but without 5.1 or DTS, this movie loses 2 stars from me, would have been 4/5."
2,Warner Brothers cheats us again.,"I can understand not giving us 5.1 Dolby Digital on III and IV, as they are a travesty, but II deserved better treatment, as it is a fine sequal, regardless of the controversy in the firing of Richard Donner. WB better wake up and smell the coffee. If you can't do it right, don't do it all."
2,Wait for Richard Donner's version,"I got this DVD out of nostalgia. I enjoyed this movie when I was younger, but I like it far less now. This sequel's inferior to Superman I, both in terms of the movie itself, and the DVD extras.I'm eagerly waiting for Richard Donner's version due out in Nov 2006. :) I've just spent this weekend googling for deleted scenes he had filmed. They generally make more sense and provide better continuity than the ones filmed by Richard Lester.Terence Stamp was very effective as the authoritative and menacing General Zod. ""Come to me, son of Jor-El! Kneeeeeel before Zod!!!"" Sarah Douglas was even more of a baddie in Donner's version. Once again, Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder gave life to their characters. No mean feat, considering the plot holes and campiness in Superman II's theatrical cut."
1,Dont Buy,"The freaking DVD didn't even work, kept stopping and skipping. Going for a refund and never looked back. Not buying from this company again....1 star is too high."
3,disappointed in ending,spinning the earth to go backwards was a bad idea the first time.if that could happen what prevents him from doing that everytime terrible things happen?and why did he go back to beat up the thug if time was reversed?Cant wait for the Man of Steel next year!
2,Richard Donner's Vision is Failing,"Sometimes when I see the 'Director's Cut' of any film it usually has some elements that are not in the theatrical release that make you say ""Hmmm, that's interesting."" or ""That would've been better!"" This is the first time that I viewed a cut that would've been far worse than the screen version. The way the three villains were freed in the original version was much more plausible than Donner's version. The editing of the first one also was first-rate. My overall opinion: stick with the original."
1,Superman - should be cut completely!,"This is just the movie for you if you like to listen to Luthor and his hench people act like they are all idiots. Logic is thrown out the window. Kryptonians can talk to each other in space. There is no chemistry between Clark and Lois at all. There is no wit in this movie, the action is mostly lame. Borrow it before you buy it. You will thank me.If you want a *good* Superman movie, I suggestSuperman - Doomsday (DC Universe Animated Original Movie)!"
4,GREAT SERVICE,WE GOT THE ME MOVIE IN VERY GOOD TIME AND AT A VERY GOOD PRICE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE USE AMAZON AND THE MADE IT VERY EASY FOR US.
5,"EXCELLENT ALL ROUND, WAIT AWHILE PLAN FOR A SPECIAL EDITION","What can you say this is the best Superhero movie of all time.Superman 2 is equal in comedy, action, Superaction and romance.The most freaky and upsetting part of this movie is seeing the twin towers, by the way my love goes out to all you Americans.Only problem with this movie is the fact of being limited extras, there is rumors that a Special Edition is coming out sometime next year hopefully, with a extended version of the film giving a better scoop on the storyline and how Superman got his powers back.Movie companys usually release a movie on DVD with limited or no extras, then a year or two later re-release the movie with a dozen extras after everyone has bought the movie.I would wait for afew months or a year or two just to see if a Special Edition is released.But over all extras or no extras this movie is fantastic, in music, action, romance, Superaction and comedy."
3,Deleted scenes?,"The movie itself deserves 4 stars. But the DVD only 3. Its only stereo unlike the first one. Additional features are pretty much non-exsistance. In my youth I recorded this movie and watched it every week. I recall a scene when the three villians come to the small American village- the little kid cycles away to get help. The talest of the villians throws a police car's syren at the child and literally blows him up. The police man says ""He was just a boy""- followed by the women vilin saying ""Yes, and he will never become a man"". I remember that scene so well as it rather violent for 5 year old viewing and is inprinted on my mind. But its not on this DVD- not even on a deleted scene selection. Perhaps never shown on American T.V but definitly shown on Australian T.V. Whats the point of these movies but to exprience better sound and vision + gaining bonus features. One of which this DVD seriously lacks. Unlike the first one which blowed my mind."
4,"""Superman II Is The Best Sequel Ever!""","""Superman II"" is the best sequel ever! But I agree with some other reviewers that the music isn't nearly as good as in the first movie and that alone lowers the quality of the movie a notch. I also agree that Richard Donner did a much better job as Director in the first movie than Richard Lester did in this movie. I liked Richard Lester fine for ""A Hard Days Night,"" but this is Superman, not the Beatles! (I also would like to see the complete Richard Donner version of this movie--before he was fired--if it exists.)But that's the bad news. The good news is that Christopher Reeve is just as good as in the first movie, and so is Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. And the trio of supervillains from Krypton--especially English actor Terrence Stamp--are the perfect super advesaries for Superman. The scenes at Superman's Fortress of Solitude are sensational, and so is the ending.I'm still not sure which is better, Superman I or Superman II, so I bought both!"
3,Don't believe the reviews that say this is better...,"Though bouyed by the prospect of seeing Supe and Lois in bed together, this stage-bound sequel cannot match the scale or gravitas of the Richard Donner SUPERMAN. The opening at the Eiffel Tower is marred by cheesy effects and the convenience of Lois just walking past cops (er... gendarmes) and up the Eiffel steps. The big action sequence with the Krypton villains ""blowing away"" the Metropolis street is painful due to the very obvious backlot-ty style set. The first Superman did such a better job of selling us that the movie was taking place in a real world, this one reeks of first England (check the little boy's accent when Zod and crew face off against small-town ""Americans"") and then of unbelievable studio sets. Even with all its production design problems and rather limply directed scenes, the story itself manages to entertain and Christopher Reeve brings an amazing naturalness to Clark. A weak three stars, to be sure."
1,Please find the ABC-TV version on DVD.,"I admit, this is what I thought the Richard Donner cut to be. After I purchased the 'Richard Donner' cut, I was sorely disappointed. The deleted scenes listed in the comments above were what really made Superman II a great movie. One deleted scene nobody really mentions was when the 3 super-villians were wrapping up their conquest of the little town of Houston and this kid mounted his horse, thinking he was riding to go get help. Zod declairs 'Nobody leaves!!!' Well, Non, posssessing a light from a police car, hurls it in the direction the child went, and we see an explosion. One of the Houston residents, in shock, says to the villians, 'He was just a boy' to which Ursa replies, 'Now, he'll never be a man!!'"
1,The inane rantings of a fanboy: this movie INFURIATES me.,"This film is one of the most painful experiences I've ever had as a Superman fan. The character is just torn to shreds, and is by far the worst defiling a superhero has ever suffered in film.Why, you may ask?I flip out with geek rage every time I see Superman give up his powers to live with Lois Lane. First of all, it is the single most selfish, childish thing a person could ever do, and it is not the least bit befitting of the greatest hero of all time. And why would he do it, anyway?! Lois fell in love with SUPERMAN, not Clark Kent.I could rant on for hundreds of words in regards to Clark Kent picking a fight and even BULLYING a man in a diner for virtually no reason or his inexplicable regaining of super-powers, but its not healthy being as angry as I am writing this. Suffice it to say, this film is just profoundly stupid, offensive, and detrimental to the Superman mythos. But that's just how I feel."
1,Lame!,"just bought this the other day and it's a classic example of paying the price for not reading the reviews before buying! if you're an action junkie like me, you'll be greatly disappointed. as soon as i noticed that the red-neck bar scene with Ursa kicking butt was left out, i took it down to the nearest FYE store and traded it in. nuff said."
5,Great Movie,"I first saw this movie when I was a little kid. I loved it then and I still love this movie today.The story is great and the action is awesome! The scene where Superman is fighting the three evil supercriminals in downtown New York was intense! One of my favorite scenes is the one where Superman picks up General Zod, swings him around and around, and launches Zod into the huge Coke sign.Also, the ending was great!"
4,worth watching,"The Richard Donner cut version was worth watching, but it was not really as good as the released version. The Donner version repeated the first Superman movie to change the past, while in the released version Superman simply did some unexplained hocus pocus on Lois' memory that he was Clark Kent. Neither version was satisfactory, but I preferred the released version which did not have to change world history to affect Lois' memory. It was good to see a few other scenes that had been cut."
1,Not the movie you think it is. Be warned...,"I bought this because I love Superman II. It was one of my favorite movies growing up and I figured ""How different could this version be?"" Well it's a lot different. From what I understand we (the audience) are supposed to view this film as a ""What could have been if Donner had directed it"" and forgive the fact that it makes the movie choppy and loses the heart that I thought was what was so great about it. If I were going to release this to DVD or especially to Blu-ray, I would have made it an extra disc released in a boxed set like they did with Blade Runner. Why is it so hard to believe that people would want the original version on Blu-ray? If I knew when I bought it what I know about this version now I would have just kept on shopping."
2,A serious time problem....,"Ok, I've just watched this Director's Cut version. My first impression is that this is the first Director's Cut that is worst than the theater version. But, besides the missing Eiffel Tower scene, the movie has several problems with the idea of time manipulation. In this version, the missile that Superman sent to space in the end of the first movie exploded and freed Zod and his friends. Ok, but if Superman made the time go back in the end of that movie, in fact, that missile was never shoot, so the villains were never set free. In this second movie, again, Superman uses the same trick to make the time go back to make Lois forget that he is Superman (among other things). And then in the end of the movie, he goes back to the restaurant where Clark was beaten by a tough guy and everyone remembers him and the fight! How can this be if the fight hadn't happen? Another failure of the script.... I really do prefer the theater version...."
1,Lester Version Was More...This is a Bad Version,"Just finished watching this movie and it was FAR, FAR less entertained than the theatrical version.Gone is the cool Eiffel Tower scene (replace by Donner's choppy opening to link it to Superman I).Lois Lane finds him out by much less interesting means (by shooting Clark Kent...really, Donner?).Gone is the romantic scene where Superman travels the world to get flowers etc for Lois Lane.Spolier coming up...Superman ""undoes"" everything by spinning the earth backwards - one of the lamest scenes in Superman I.If I could return this DVD, I would."
1,Not Anamorphic!,"Be warned that this Blu-Ray of ""Superman II - The Donner Cut"" is ""not"" anamorphic. That means it was recorded with solid bars on the top and bottom of the 4/3 box in which the film is copied. That means that the actual resolution of the film is only about 650p, not the advertised 1080p. The remaining 430 lines are used to record the black bars, which are visable when the movie is viewed with the TV set to 4/3 format. Many movies, even major releases like ""The Matrix,"" are released like this and in so doing, misrepresent the resolution of the viewed movie."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"I am so glad I purchased the regular DVD version of the Donner cut before I knew the Blu ray version was out. If you are a fan of 1 and 2 as I am, this is a rip-off and a waste of time and money. Case in point, there is a scene between Superman and Lois Lane that was imported in from ""screen test"" footage. They didn't even look the same. Don't spend a dime of your valuable Blu Ray money on the Donner cut. You'll be sorry you did. Be forewarned."
4,VERY GOOD,WELL I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE END HOW EVERYTHING GET BACK TO NORMAL EVEN THOUGH THE TOWN HAS BEEN DESTROY OTHERWISE I LOVE THIS MOVIE EVERYTHING IS PERFECT
4,The saga has come full circle,"This is the version that should have always been, the tone matches the first Superman movie in every single detail. It has erased the shoddy quality of the Lester cut for me. Well done, Dick and Tom."
3,Mislead!,I ordered this on Amazon instant viewing under the Donner cut version and I was given the regular version. I wish Amazon posted that the regular version could only be ordered through this way.
2,superman 2 R Donner Cut,"Some disks are defective. WB problem. Some disks cannot pLay or get stuck. This cut is not as good as original...but it is nice to see something different. NEW SCENES, ETC..."
2,Well written but miss titled,"I felt the book was well written and he does know his stuff.... but the book was more about the history of computers than a book to learn Accounting principals, which is what I thought I had bought:( What he does write about he does well and you will learn from it A more appropriate title might be ""The History of Computers and Chips"" with a touch of ""Accounting"""
4,For Proust fans,"It seems Marcel spent a great deal of time writing ""Remembrance..."" and I spent almost as much time reading it-but it was worth it. As difficult as the novel is to read, one doesn't have to get too far into it to realize that the author was a genius with words. I think to have any appreciation for the movie and for Jeremy Irons performance, it's best to have read the book. Otherwise you might find Charles Swann completely insufferable and the movie boring. But for those who have read it, I think you will find Irons performance maddeningly perfect. Ornella was beautiful,and I agree with the reviewer that the movie, at the very least, gives one an idea of the fashion and style that made up the early years in young Marcel's social life."
3,Amazon.com review is factually wrong,"Marshall Fine doesn't know what he's talking about: Swann is not a French aristocrat. He may have money but he's a perpetual outsider in fin-de-siècle Paris because he's Jewish. The film itself is visually stunning, but because Jeremy Irons is dubbed, it feels fake at its core."
3,Mrshall Fine's comments are insulting and stupid,"It's unbelievable that Amazon would sanction Marshall Fine's comments. In fact, there are thousands of serious readers who have read Proust's work. There is an online Proust discussion group with hundreds of members who have read In Search of Lost Time several times, both in the original French and in a number of recent translations. Mr. Fine's characterization of reading of Proust as something that needs to be faked tells us a lot about his failings, but sadly it also tells us something about Amazon.As for Volker Schlondorff's film, it's adequate. Jeremy Irons is the visual embodiment of Swann (the French dubbing doesn't really help), which is about all we really need to know, although Raul Ruiz's Time Regained is a more ambitious and satisfying work."
4,"A stunning blu-ray from Gaumont, all-region friendly","This period piece is a delight on the Gaumont blu-ray, and it's a stunning scan, looking beautifully filmlike. This is the kind of film that benefits immensely from a well-done, high-definition treatment. The film can be viewed with an English soundtrack, featuring Irons' own voice, that's a somewhat better option than the original French-language version, where he's dubbed. The choice is yours on this blu-ray, which also includes removeable French subtitles.As for the film, Schlondorf deftly handles the daunting task of tackling Proust with a surprisingly International touch, and it's as good a romance about consuming jealousy as anything else out there. There's a clever use of time, and the denouement is sufficiently Proustian. Very effective."
3,Worth Watching Just for Muti,"This is one of the rare Jeremy Irons' movies that are entirely forgettable, except for Muti, who radiates amazing sensuality. The movie is definitely worth checking out, if only to watch Muti, over and over again."
1,Boring only iluminated by Muti's eyes,"It's a slow boring film, where nobody shines. Not even the beautiful Ornella Muti, who barely shows a little of her beauty in this film. Wouldn' watch it again."
4,A must have for people interested in Alchemy and/or Psychology,"Deeply influenced by Paracelsus, Martinus Rulandus defines Imagination as ""the Star in man"". A wonderful work"
5,absolutely flawless,It's all been written before in other reviews for this performance. It is truly amazing. Bill Withers is as powerful a personality as he is a vocalist and performer. This album leaves me wanting to know more about him.
3,Best Live CD Ever?,It's very possible. The band is tight. The crowd is really into the performance. The artist gets very personal with background info on the songs. You haven't heard Bill Withers till you listen to this CD. Another reviewer wondered why there was no DVD of this. I second that emotion.PS-I give this CD 5 Stars. I hit the wrong button!
4,Very good indeed,"But I must admit the sound was a little off. His compilation is better, nevertheless it lacks the charm of a live concert."
5,live bill withers,A great musical experience one beter than any modern musician could even dream of becoming. Powerful and soulfull at its best. With pure awesome funk blues music
3,"OK, but there are so many more-interesting recordings","The music sometimes seems too hurried to give much emphasis to the picturesque quality of the tone poems involved. There's not a lot of color in some of the interpretations, like the opening of ""Winter,"" as there is pure energy. Still, it's invigorating. It's also nice to have the two fill-ups: the Concerto for 3 Violins, RV 551, and the Concerto for 4 Violins, RV 580.John J. PuccioClassical Candor"
5,Mike and the boys...,"This album just plain owns. The lyrics are tongue in cheek and they make you think. The instrumentals are awesome. It's just an album that'll make you want to get up and do something about all of the crap going on in the world. And after you buy the album and listen to it a couple of times, seeing the greatness that is The AKAs, go check them out live. They're so energetic that you won't stop moving until long after the music has stopped."
3,T(I)NC for Beginners,"If you likeThe (International) Noise Conspiracy, henceforth refered to as T(I)NC, you'll likely find the A.K.A.s somewhat familiar. If you REALLY, REALLY like T(I)NC, they you'll probally find it somewhat derivative, with the vaguely left winged lyrics, and the poppy garage sound that T(I)NC helped to bring to the forefront once again. Standing on it's own, the album is pretty good, but I just keeping thinking that they formed the band to copy the sound, politics, and even the look of T(I)NC."
2,so-so,"I am a Frank fan. That being said, I was a lot disappointed with this album. Is it bad, no. Is it up to his usual vibrant quality, no. Perhaps Christmas songs can't be done that well? Michael Buble seems to be able to do it though. Can't recommend it."
3,So Sorry,"I enjoy Frank, I enjoy crooners. This cd has a number of very good songs on it, however, it has some that are not as enjoyable. It is nice to hear Mr. Sinatra and the family sing some songs together, however, they aren't really great to listen to more than once. I'm terribly sorry I didn't like it. Again there are a lot of good tunes on this cd, just be preparred for a few you won't always want to listen to."
1,Self Absorbed 60's TV Fare,"There are only 3 of 18 songs that are worth anything on this project. Two of the three are with Bing.Without Bing, this cd should be tossed out the car window on the expressway...The music is mostly 60's arrangements that sound like they were designed for television variety show, ""On Songs"".The music is more a vehicle for Sinatra's self absorption and showcasing his son and daughter than anything having to do with the spirit of Christmas. The mood in Sinatra's voice seems far removed from any Christmas Spirit... This is ironically showcased in his rendition of ""Whatever Happened to Christmas""..Well it clearly doesn't show up on this album..Buy the songs with Bing from the Itunes store and avoid the rest.Sinatra is the greatest at what he does but miserably fails with this collection."
3,"Not Nearly as Good as ""Christmas Songs by Sinatra""","Bought this CD on the basis of the good reviews here. I like it, but overall, I don't think it touches the quality Frank gives us on ""Christmas Songs by Sinatra.""This version relies on lots and lots of choral support -- which isn't my preferred way to hear Sinatra.""Christmas Songs by Sinatra"" contains more straight Sinatra. Also, it has more traditional songs, whereas this CD has lots of songs that I don't think Frank sings as well as the old standards.Don't get me wrong, I think this CD is fine. But I'd recommend ""A Jolly Christmas from Frank Sinatra"" and ""Christmas Songs by Sinatra"" IF you prefer Sinatra singing classic Christmas songs largely on his own."
5,"A Holiday ""MUST"" For Every Sinatra Fan!","Sinatra is as much a part of Christmas in my household as ""chestnuts, turkey and the tree"". This album is a must for every Sinatra fan. The song Christmas Memories where he sings about the happy faces of children who now have children of their own brings back so many memories of my own two children one of whom has given me the precious gift of grandchildren of my own. I never tire of this thoughtful and heartwarming collection. You won't be disappointed."
4,as expected,this is what I was looking for and came in timely manner. It's def 8 x 10 so make sure you get a nice frame to enhance it.
5,A classic everyone should read,"Chose to read this book after it made The First Tuesday book club's top 10 Australian books. So glad I did. The subject matter is unrelentingly awful relative to our modern standards, but you find yourself caring about the Darcys and wanting to know how things will turn out for them. I had to keep reminding myself that this wasn't really all that long ago. I don't know much about Ruth Park but she writes as if she had first hand experience of life in Surry Hills.If you enjoy a book that is well written, makes you question your assumptions, and has you thinking about it long after you finish, then you will enjoy this one."
2,A huge disappointment,"This classic Australian novel, comes highly recommended. It is about post-WW2 Surrey Hills slum dwellers, revolves around members of a poor Irish immigrant family and their neighbours. It's a standard story of poverty, dysfunction, filth, teenage pregnancy, alcoholism, violence and despair. None of the characters is particularly attractive and it has all been seen before. The writing is too ploddy, repetitive and unidimensional to retain this reader's attention. At the end, I am sorry, I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them."
5,run don't walk,"If there is a place for instrumental pop music that isn't soulless and robotic or sugery sweet then this be it. This disk is teeming with life - real musicians grooving to the real thing. If you dig Medeski, Martin and Wood or the Mancini covers done by the Oranj Symphonette (and if you haven't yet, check them out too) you don't have to go back to the mono days of Bacharach, et. al to appreciate these guys. The analog stereo creates a nice smooth feel you won't find on most contemporary jazz records. And, God love the rhythm section -- Diken and friends propel these tunes into that little cranny in the back of your brain, landing directly on that musical G-spot. Go ahead, enjoy."
5,Ancient Skins Parchments and Leathers,"Few texts boast completeness as this book can. It is so well written that it is hard to put down. What is amazing is that as useful, informative, and complete as this book is, no one has bothered to arrange with the Reed family to republish it. It is a standard work by this time yet almost impossible to own...a sad state of affairs."
4,"Great protection, hard to rub in.","Once you get the lotion applied, this is a great lotion. If you're used to spray ons, this takes a lot more time than you're used to though! Kids can get squirmy. It's pretty thick. But my kids have fair skin and this is the only lotion that totally protects them."
1,Not chemical free!,"Description says"" chemical free."" It has parabens(as well as other harmful chemicals) which are known for causing cancer! (whatever you put on your skin is absorbed into your bloodstream.) This is false advertising. I am a cancer survivor and would not consider putting these chemicals on my skin or on my children's skin."
5,Wow..Does the job,"Ordered product online through Amazon. Ordering was easy and I received in a short amount of time. Heard about the product from my UPS driver. His dermatologist recommended it to him after a bout with melanoma. After talking to him and reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try....was heading to the beach for a week and wanted to keep the grandchildren from getting sunburn. It is thick, but it rubs in quickly. It worked great! I was on the beach for hours and just got a very 'slight' tan. There were a couple of places that I missed applying it, and boy were they red. I would highly recommend this product to be safe in the sun."
1,Not at all what I was hoping for,"I have been using a similar product, with Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide as the sunblocking agents, but I don't care much for its strong scent. So, after reading all the positive reviews of the Blue Lizard sunscreens I decided to give the fragrance free version a try. Maybe it works well for some people, but for me this sunscreen is extremely greasy and did not protect my skin from the sun. With it as greasy as it was, even after drying it off then re-applying more before going outside, it felt to me like my now shiny-oily skin actually attracted the sun instead of blocking it! I might as well have gone outside with no sunscreen on at all. I am very surprised and disappointed that I didn't like this product better, especially considering the cost."
1,grant writing,A waste of money as the grant writing examples do not fit non-profit organizations. Workbook style and who has time to do the pages plus write the grant!
1,It wasn't worth a dime,I hated it I wasted my money and time. Not one grant did I recieve. Don't make the same mistake i did.
5,"""Winning Grants"" is a Winner","I read ""Winning Grants"" by Mim Carlson from the perspective of a grant funder and a grant writer. I found the book to be an easy-to-read workbook for developing a quality proposal. The worksheets are helpful and having them on the CD in electronic format is a huge asset. The book seems touches on all of the key essentials for grant writing. I will recommend it to the novice grant writers that I work with."
3,"Good for foundation grants, not so good for gov't grants","The information contained in this book primarily applies to non-governmental entities soliciting grants from non-profit foundations. Organizations like the NSF, NIH, etc., have fairly strict guidelines and don't permit the ""excesses"" encouraged in this book.As the review title states, this would probably be a very useful book for a charitable organization looking to obtain funds from corporate foundations. However, if you're looking for research money from a government organization like Nat'l Science Foundation or Dep't of Education, this book is virtually useless."
4,For beginners,"Mim Carlson's ""Winning Grants"" provides an excellent overview of what steps to follow when seeking foundation funding. It provides a fair amount of general information that will be useful for readers who lack proposal writing experience. Unfortunately, the book suffers from being a bit too general in its approach. The author attempts to cover both private and public grant writing, but the overlap between these two areas is not great enough to justify lumping them together. My only other complaint is that an index is not included."
5,John Lennon My Hero,"This movie made me feel special in a way. John Lennon is a gift from heaven. This is one unexplain movie.John Lennon is still alive in our hearts and minds. I just learn one thing in this movie. As long as I have Rock N' Roll , I'm forever young.."
5,Just wondering in KC,"I enjoyed the movie when it came out in the theatre, but...Does anyone know what the difference is between the two movies Amazon lists?Imagine -The Deluxe EditionandImagine -The Definitive Portrait (not available till 2010?!)"
4,Great Film...Lousy DVD,"This movie deserved better treatment from Warner Brothers. The video and audio presentation leaves alot to be desired. On a different note, did anybody catch the the room number of John & Yoko's hotel suite in Gilbraltor during their bed-in. It is 1208. That is 12/08. Pretty damn creepy."
1,"GREAT movie, but the remaster audio is MONO! Why?","The Audio 2.0? Rubbish! The fact is it's mono...straight down the middle mono.I have a copy of the original released VHS tape and it was recorded in stereo. (The tape sounds pretty good too, although the use of reverb and slap-back echo is a bit much at times.)Did I buy a defective DVD?The picture quality in my opinion is pretty good considering the age of some of the film stock used in production.The DVD description above says this is a 2 disc set. Mine is a single disc and yet it contains all the extras.Am I missing something?NOTE: The movie itself I rate 5 stars.The lack of attention to the audio aspect of the movie I rate 1 star.Here's hoping someone from WB Home Video will correct this issue."
3,Posthumous rip-off,This 2-DVD edition could have easily fitted on 1 DVD. THe material is o.k. albeit a little self-congratulary with the director and producer of the DVD being interviewd on their own DVD. But it is little less than deceit to offer this as a 'double' DVD. Imagine John Lennon ripping you off.
4,An Excellent Addition To Your Beatles Collection,"It took me almost four years to find this movie. For a time, I've listened to the soundtrack, and it was so amazing. I just had to find the movie. Finally, I managed to purchase it and I was awestruck. The film depicts a lot from Lennon's private life from his life with Yoko to his untimely death. Although, some live appearances, especially with the Beatles at the 1963 Royal Variety Show, were reworked using some studio recordings. Another thing is the scene when John and Yoko make love is a little irratating. I'd rather skip that scene, for the rest is absolutely brilliant. I can't wait for it to come on DVD. I hope they'll add footage that couldn't make to the final cut, for they have over 200 hours of footage. If you like John Lennon at his best in his own movie narrated by himself, my advice is to get this NOW!!!"
4,A Wonderful Experience,"The DVD release of Imagine was long overdue and now that it is available perhaps a new generation of music lovers will understand a little of the magic, majesty and tragedy of John and The Beatles. The film is as fresh and insightful as always. It sounds great, too.My only problem, as mentioned in some of the previous reviews, is that the DELUXE isn't very. In the nearly two decades since the movie was originally released scant new material is available here. The packaging was minimal even for a standard feature release. That said, this movie is worth owning and should be shown regularly in junior high school music appreciation classes."
4,John!,"I loved this movie so much,and I actually cry every time I see it. A must for any Beatle or John Lennon Fan. And for people who have to write a report on John this is the best thing to watch."
2,Imagine: A Clear Picture and Quality Audio,"Well, keep looking. Absolutely no money was spent to enhance the audio or the picture. I understand the picture quality, some of John's home video's are so grainy to begin with that it's probably be impossible to improve on them much but the audio was 2.0. It would've been kinda nice to hear some of the songs on a 5.1 surround. With today's technology, it can be done, and rather cheaply too. This is why I give it a 2 star rating and I didn't really mind that the ""extra's"" weren't worth a pot to spit in.The movie, itself, is 5 Stars. This is THE definitive documentary of John Lennon. It shows the good and some of the bad too. It gives him a more ""human"" quality and , of course, the soundtrack is awesome. I can only hope that one day it can be re-mastered and restored.Imagine that!"
5,loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just enjoy watching this video very much. He was the greatest song writer to me.....i wished so much to one day meet him personaly, buy due to a crazed person, that will never be possible. this video lets you imagine,,,,,the real John Lennon on a personal level.i miss you john, but your music lives on."
4,Best of album culled from two different sources,"ALL TIME BEST OF LOUIS ARMSTRONG (aka Louis Armstrong's Greatest Hits) includes the original KAPP singles of ""Hello Dolly"" and ""What A Wonderful World."" These and three other tracks come from the MCA archives. The other six songs here, CAPITOL recordings all, have Satchmo in tandem with Bing Crosby. Conspicuously missing are ""Mack The Knife"" and ""A Kiss To Build A Dream On."" A one-page bio rounds out this budget package, which has fine audio fidelity throughout.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 31:14"
1,A good author gone bad,"I've liked all his past books, but certainly not this one. Some of the fiction is good--but I had already read it elsewhere. The non-fiction, though: He is asserting that HIV doesn't cause AIDS, he basically supports creationism and he's saying that ozone depletion is nonsensical. If they were well-supported positions I could accept that from a SF author, but they are only well-supported by very selective use of evidence."
4,Quirky Vintage Weller,"An urban ""Moby Dick""! Suspenseful yet humorous with some purposely overblown rat scenes. (ONE rat, not ""hordes."") The film is not a scary rat flick, (though it has some fright moments)--it's a psychological thriller about a man being drawn into obsession."
4,"Great movie ,dont listen to the others","the movie had some week points , but the man's obsession with the rat, was very real. a must see ,i am looking to buy it on dvd ,thanks chris"
5,"""Ben"" got nothin' on this one!!","Worst movie!? Please!! Great Movie all the way through.It's not just a horror but it is a Psychological one as well.Watch as Peter Weller slowly detiorates into Jason,hockey mask and all.And you will learn a few things as well,like DO NOT leave the cover down on your toilet bowl.Let's just say Great Title and Great Movie."
2,"2.5 STARS: Entertaining and very funny movie, but...","""Of Unknown Origin"" really is a rather entertaining and humorous movie. It's more of a dark comedy than horror, though. Peter Weller stars in this movie about a man who has his life turned upside down by an unwanted guest in his home. The acting is good as Weller does a terrific job as usual. That being said, I thought this was supposed to be a horror movie, and from that standpoint, I was disappointed. I guess it's a brand of horror, but not the kind that appeals to me in that sense. However, as a dark comedy this movie does very well. Just depends on what you're looking for."
1,a moronic mess from start to finnish,Peter Weller is not a great actor and proves it in this shameful and rather stupid horror film i saw on late night t.v. When i went back to bed though i could not sleep i was too busy lauging at the insane script this film had about an executive who has a monstorus problem when hordes of hungrey rats entrap him in his happy home. Weller is an idiot yuppie trapped in an idiot's movie even the ending is idiotic! Nothing worth remebering so bad is this film television exces put it on late at night so no one will watch it. Acadmey award winning material its not. A film like this should stay unknown.
4,Does what you want...,"This battery came quickly, fit my camera with no problems, charged up quickly and has performed well during picture taking. It is about half the cost of brand name and works well....I would reccomend."
2,"Nice place, shame about the text","Having lived in both Cape Town and Oxford I looked forward to getting lost in this book. Maybe I was just missing the point, or maybe I expected too much, but instead of beguiling it just annoyed. On the positive side, the use of different times and spaces concurrently worked well, but the introduction of so many famous faces from the past... Just flashing familiar faces and building on their stereotypes does not make it an interesting historical novel. I will admit that I may be being too hard on this book, it has after all been given great reviews, but of the three people I know who've read it, each being from Oxford and/or Cape Town, no-one has found that it warrents its reviews."
5,DVD,"I ordered this as a gift, so I have no comments concerning the content. The DVD arrived on time and I was pleased with the transaction."
3,Nice job explaining a tough subject,"This was used in a class and I found it a decent complement to the instructor's explanation. However, sometimes the style explores a topic so much that it won't commit to an actual definition.A good introduction to various epistemologies and theoretical perspectives."
3,This book has seven different interesting and funny stories.,"This book containing seven different short stories, explains how being young and being a teenager can be comlicated, but also fun and exciting! The stories talk about tenagers in love, and how they get on eachothers nerves. It talks about going to school and many other interesting stories, talking about teenagers and their everyday life."
5,Fascinating look at the Master,"Since when is it the responsibility of Hollywood to produce historically accurate movies?? I'm a history buff and I ticks me off every time I watch Last of the Mohicans, but does that make it a bad movie? No. Dragon is not all that historically accurate as far as some events in Bruce's life but it is one of my all time favorites and very well done. Especially because it puts a human face on such a mysterious icon. This movie is not a lesson in Wing Chun, and yes most of the fight scenes are all too Van Damme-ish but as exciting as all get out to watch. Brandon did an excellent job of portraying his father and the short roller coaster life he lived. It is truly sad that we have lost these fascinating icons."
1,The Dragon Dies Hard The American Version,"The Dragon Dies Hard was a cheap,trashy Hong Kong bio pic of the 70s.Sadly Dragon The Bruce Lee Story wasn`t all that much better.Execpt that Van Williams TVs Green Hornet has a cameo the buget is clearly bigger.As for the film it was as silly as it`s Chinese counter part.I gave it one star but I must say that is kind.Jason Scott Lee ends up maki ng Bruce Lee look like a geek when he keeps saying I`m Bruce Lee.Lauren Holly is acceptable in the ro ll of Linda Lee.There is no attempt in this film t tell us anything we don`t already know about the m am Bruce Lee.I have to admit that I purchased this movie because it is part of a series of films I ke ep in my collection related to Bruce Lee."
4,"Great film, fitting for the legend","""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" is Hollywood's grand obituary to a man who tragically died before making what was supposed to be his heroic return to Hollywood but whose impact on Hollywood has been undeniable in the past 25 years. Factually and chronogically, this film is not entirely accurate, and any serious fan of Bruce Lee will know that at the outset. Nevertheless, it does a superb job at capturing Bruce Lee's indomitable courage and spirit and combining first-rate martials arts action with a real-life love story--an uncommon feat that instantly renders this film appealing to both men and women. Even if you know nothing about Bruce Lee or the martial arts, you will be touched by this film about the legend who became the first international Asian film star and forever changed both the film and martial arts worlds. Bruce Lee certainly deserves a big Hollywood biopic like this, even if it is long overdue and not completely accurate."
4,Great movie with some surprising themes.,"Jason Scott Lee is wonderful as an imperfect, animated and likeable Bruce Lee. I found the fight scenes well shot and exciting, though the story intrigued me more than anything.As a child, Bruce's father sends him to America as a final attempt at fooling a demon that haunts the males in their family. (He also gave Bruce a girl's name upon birth for the same reason.) Bruce is excited to be in America at first, but finds the bitter racism and other blocks to opportunity disheartening as he makes some immature mistakes in life.Bruce's stubbornness, combined with his willingness to teach martial arts to all races, finds him success as well as enemies in the US. Eventually, Bruce gets his break, and even seems to conquer his demon. We all know what the end has to be, but the movie does a good job of not dwelling on it and uses extensive poetic liscense to bring it about.I loved it."
1,inaccuracy of the real Bruce,"To me, it is dissappointing.. Perhaps I'm narrow minded.. but judging from what I know from the documentary DVD ""Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey""..1. He didn't broke his back because somebody kicked him from the back, he had it because an overtrain.2. This movie portray Bruce as someone easily seduced by women before he was married.. I don't believe such a deep philosopher like that would do something silly such as seduced by the woman in the restaurant the first time he to got to america.3. In the match where a combat was offered to decide upon his rights to teach other non-chinese students, according to Bruce Lee's wife LInda Lee.. she watched that match..I think this movie is just like the case with Jet Li's fearless. People need to tell accurate stories, because this can be used as guide by youngsters and elders in order to pursue a better life.Let people know what is the true story of Bruce Lee."
4,Surprisingly good film with many DVD extras,"This is director Rob Cohen's feature debut (followed by Dragonheart and Daylight, the cable movie Rat Pack, and the unwatchable The Skulls), and it is easily his best. The film has heart and sparks a greater interest in Bruce Lee himself. Because of this film I have sought out some of Bruce Lee's films (Enter the Dragon is a great DVD with lots of extras). One thing I look for in DVDs is commentary, and this is one has excellent running commentary by the director, Cohen. It really enhances the film upon a second viewing and has some very interesting insights into the creative process that goes into dramatizing a biography. Overall a recommend. Universal Pictures I think has done the best job of all the studios in chocking their DVD releases full of extras. If only they made more great movies!"
2,Untrue Story,I have to say this movie is terribly exaggerated and untrue. Especially the scene in the movie where Bruce Lee is getting beat up and has to fight for his life in the ice house. This part of the movie never happened. Bruce Lee never got beat up and he never fought the gung fu San Francisco man's brother. Bruce Lee also never got his back broke in a fight. Bruce suffered a pinched nerve in his back through improper weight training. Any true Bruce Lee fan knows this movie is not accurate. If your going to do a movie about Bruce Lee at least make it accurate. I gave 2 stars instead one out of respect for Bruce. However I don't believe Bruce would have ever approved of this film.
5,perfect,"this title came perfect timing AND PERFECT CONDITION, THANK YOU MUCH I WILL SHOP WITH HIM IN THE FUTURE, ALSO SORRY FOR THE CAPS. grrrrrr"
5,Jason Scott Lee is amazing in this touching film,"This is definately one of my favorite movies of all time. While sometimes the film can get a little corny, Jason Scott Lee's acting is phenomenal. This isn't a text-book copy of Bruce Lee's life, but rather it tells the viewer about his personality, his love, and his struggles. This is a thoroughly entertaining film that honours a true hero. Lauren Holly is also excelling as Linda Lee. Perhaps this is one of her best performances to date."
2,Foul play,"Whatever merits this movie could have as an entertainment vehicle, it was lost due to one simple reason: its title is ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee STORY"". I repeat: THE BRUCE LEE STORY""!! So don't come to me saying (like a lot of reviews here say) that this is just fiction loosely based on Bruce's life.Once you say ""Bruce Lee STORY"", the limits of ""changes for dramatic purposes"" are extremely reduced. And, as a fan of Bruce's movies, I watched it expecting to learn something real about his life, not a movie that has practically the whole script fabricated, almost 100% fake! I could not believe my eyes while I was watching it!The only people who can give this picture a five star rating are the ones who did not watch Lee's movies or don't care about his real life. That's the only explanation. This movie butchered completely the book by Linda Lee (and even so she accepted this untrue version of the life of Bruce Lee)."
2,Only if you don't need truth,"Many of the events in this movie are totally fabricated. Rather discouraging to true martial arts fans. The fights are entertaining enough, but don't compare to the action you see in HK films."
5,Great Movie.,"Awesome movie about Bruce Lee! Even if you don't like or even know who he is, this movie is a must own."
5,"Excellent movie, full of action, comedy, and emotion","All I can say is that this movie is great. Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story wasn't meant to be a movie about Bruce Lee the film star, or Bruce Lee the martial artist. It was written to depict Bruce Lee, the man. I think that the authenticity of intensity that Jason Scott Lee shows in this movie pays a huge tribute to the late Bruce Lee. I read one review that complained that this should have been called the ""Linda Lee Story"". Perhaps is should have. Who else to tell the story of the legend than his wife? The movie does take liberties about the life of Bruce, but it was written as a tribute to both him and his fans. It was written as a way to include the myths, rumors, and greatness that made him a legend. Great movie, definite buy. The DVD itself contains sooooooo much great stuff. Commentary, trailers, interviews, a photo show of bruce lee, a photo show of the movie. You just can't ask for more."
1,DISAPPOINTED,The DVD would not play on any of our DVD or BlueRay products. It was not clear when I purchased this that it would not play in Australia.
4,I love this movie!,This is a great story about the life of Bruce Lee and Jason Scott Lee is excellent in the movie.
5,Movies,This was a very hard to find and this was a good price I bought it. My kids and I love this movie.
4,"Very good movie, but not accurate.","I have seen this movie a few times. Very entertaining, funny, and sometimes sad. The reason why it does not get five stars : Bruce Lee is portrayed to be too weak. I mean, this guy could take down Jackie Chan, Van Damme, Chuck Norris, and Bolo Yeang together in one shot!"
5,dragon: bruce lee story,enjoyed the presentation. good quality sound and video.content believable. cleared up some history.remarkable story of hard work and dedication.
5,Fabulous!,"Although I haven't listened to enough different recordings of Monk to compare the quality of the tracks found here to other Monk albums, I was absolutely wowed by the quality of the music. This isn't the kind of ""good music"" that you have to try hard to appreciate. It just sails along through the afternoon with you, and it definitely had me up dancing and grooving along at some points. Best of all, it got me out of a rut that I'd been in with my poetry. Jazz, great jazz, should have that effect. To try to pick my favorite tracks would be ridiculous; they're all sublime. Perhaps the ultimate compliment is that listening to this CD made me want to get my hands on more of his music. Bravo to a true musical genius, Thelonious Monk!"
5,How Adorable!,"I am so happy with my TY King Charles Cavalier Spaniel, Regal. We have a male King Charles Cav. and Regal looks like our Sir Cooper, but Regal doesn't chew my oreintal rug! I would order from this ocompany again. The shipping was 4 days. Ordered on 4/7/09 and arrived sat. 4/11. I have a very special place for Regal, far from Cooper! Cooper thinks it's his.Bravo to this company."
5,Mary Christmas,"For my husband and myself this movie is an annual favorite. It could be placed in the same category as It's A Wonderful life or Charlie Brown's Christmas. We never grown tired of it, to us a great holiday classic."
5,A Heart warmng Story,"I had seen this movie on TV, several years ago. I have always enjoyed this movie. It is very goood"
5,Very Useful,These came in handy while storing pumped milk. They fit in the fridge or freezer perfectly and have markings on the side so you know how much is in there.
3,Great for starters,This is a great starter pack becuase it comes with a sample of what you will need to begin pumping. However I felt that the 2.7 ounce sizes are too small as my baby was eating 4 ounces when I went back to work. So one of these containers was too small for the amount I was pumping.
4,"Great, but tiny!",I love these containers because they're compact - more upright than wide - and they are economical compared to one-time use bags. The only thing I hate about them is that they only come in 2.7 ounce size! MEDELA: MAKE THEM TALLER / BIGGER FOR OLDER BABIES!!! :-)
3,#7 plastic used in lids ...,"i've always been told the safest plastic options (for reusability) are the numbers, 2, 4 & 5. And on the medela bottles (5 ounce) that came with the pump, this is the case (i believe they use #4 plastic). However, with these bottles under the cap in the little triangle i noticed the number 7.This makes me a little nervous to use them. The milk always ends up touching the lid... i know they say the bottles are BPA free, but does that count for the lid too?Why would Medela make the bottle lids out of a different material from their regular bottle lids.I think i will stop using them.#7 plastic is also very difficult to recycle."
2,"Good for Fridge, Bad for Freezer","These bottles are not bad if you store your milk in the fridge but not in the freezer. Keep them in the freezer and it takes FOREVER to defrost them. Extremely inconvenient. I used to take them to work to pump milk but then switch to Lansinoh Storage bags, which I find much easier to use. I would not buy these again, and I would not recommend these since they are not practical to use at all."
5,Awesome!!,"I've purchased about 6 packs of these for pumping, storing, and freezing. They are excellent for many reasons! First, I can pump directly into them with my Medela Freestyle. Second, they are a great size for storage. If you freeze them they are the perfect amount, not too big to too small. I buy the medela nipples that fit directly onto these bottles so they are easy to use. Yes, the nipples directly fit onto these to use. Love them! Plus, after this baby, I can reuse these bottles with our second child."
2,Great bottles for pumping,Really really wish the numbers and markings were bigger - too tiny to read really. Other than that these are great for pumping and storing.
5,"great size, used with ameda pump",these are compatible with the ameda pump. they are a useful size (2.5 oz.) and are reusable. they are not sterile packed and need to be boiled before first use.
4,Great size but needs a dispenser,These are very handy for quick bottles. Knowing that each stores 2.5 oz makes bottle prep a snap. I wish that they came with some sort of dispensing system for the fridge so that the freshest one was always in front. Sort of like those dispensers for soda cans that you can get for your fridge. You would drop the most recently pumped bottles in a hole in the back and the ones to use first would roll up to the front. Otherwise it's kind of a pain to store them in the fridge. The bases are narrow and they tend to tip over on the wire shelves in my fridge.
5,Great buy,"Decent price and fast shipping. Great product to start saving milk, especially in early months of breast feeding as you don't produce enough milk to fill storage bags"
5,Useful,"I'm using it for the last month and I ordered another pack recently.The good thing about it is that it is reusable. I can also connect it directly to Medela and Ameda breast-pump.Now when I'm pumping more this things are less useful, because you can pump only 2 oz in the bottle.I'm still keeping milk in them, because it's easy to heat the milk under the water (they are small and tall, so the milk will warm faster).Unfortunately, when you froze the milk, these bottle became quite fragile - one of the bottles fell of in the freezer and cracked. Now I'm keeping them in a box."
5,Nice Milk Storage Option,"These bottles are perfect for using a dual pump... No, I didn't personally use them, but my wife did! They attach directly to the Medela shields, and can then be capped and put directly into the refrigerator or freezer. The only 'drawback' is if you produce more than 80ml each side, because you would then obviously have to change them out mid-pumping. I'm sure there are larger containers out there if you need them."
2,bad chemical smell even after several washing,"The plastic emits a really bad plastic smell, I wonder if the smell gets into the breast milk stored in them too. For caution, I don't recommend them."
2,You're better off using freezer bags,"The average baby who nurses 8 times a day needs at least 3 ounces of milk per feeding, but these only hold about 2.7 ounces each. You'd need at least 9 bottles to store a full day's supply of milk. If you just want to store small amounts of milk for occasional use, these might be fine, but if you're trying to build up a good-size supply, you're better off using the plastic storage bags instead. The bags are way less expensive, and when stored flat, they take up a lot less room in your freezer. I pump into bottles, then pour the milk into the bags to freeze."
1,so so bad,when the product arrived it said it was new but there was a safety seal on it that was broken and un sealed. the seal said do not use if seal is broken for safety reasons. the bottles had water drop marks to suggest they had been used and washed. I was very disappointed and threw them in the trash. I figured if i had to pay shipping to return not worth the time. Please whoever sent these please let them know especially for storing breast milk this was so unacceptable.
1,Smells terrible after multiple washings,"These have a horrible plastic smell after 2 hand washings, 2 sterilizations, and a run through the dishwasher. I wouldn't store my own beverages in them let alone my baby's milk. None of my other Medela products smell this bad, I don't know why these bottles do."
1,Too small,Personally barely ever used this size. Much better off purchasing the 4 oz storage bottles. I have a whole stock of them that I only use if I'm out of the 4 oz containers.
1,Very bad smell,"The tubes have very very bad and strong plastic smell. Even after I washed the tubes and boiled them with hot water again, the smell was still very strong. The other plastic products from medela do not have the same smell. For the babies' safty, I do NOT recommend the product to anyone."
1,OVER-PRICED,"I love the ninja turtles, im the biggest fan i think there ever was. I love the 80's and 90's series. And i do love this series, but the price for a disc with 3-4 episodes on it is outrageous. I found this same dvd at Dollar General for $3. After buying it there for 3 dollars it breaks my heart to see 12 dollars for this disc."
1,YUCK!,"This is such a piece of junk. It was broken when I received it. I called and requested a second and it did arrive in tact but cracked and broke a few weeks later when I was moving it from my kitchen table to my desk. I purchases an ""Antec"" after this and it's been great!"
5,Whooo!! Yami Bakura on DVD!!,"Hehehe. Yes, I am a Yami Bakura fan!! ^_^ This DVD is excellent. Not only does it have Yami B's first episode, it also has BOTH Panik episodes!!! (They were spliced into one episode on the WB, but they're much better as two different episodes.) And there's even subtitles (I prefer to think of them as closed-captioning) and a way to change the language into Spanish! Yami B's Spanish voice ain't too bad X3 You should definitely buy this!!! ^_^"
2,"At best, a poor homage to Stephen King's ""The Stand""","The premise and build-up are straight lifts from Stephen King's ""The Stand"". The characters are unidimensional and plastic. The ending is saccharine. Save your money, or spend it on the original and far superior version of this yarn."
5,Apocalypse Wow!,"What can I say, I'm a sucker for a good end of the world book. It's dark, but not so dark as to be depressing. Realistic, hopeful, and full of three dimensional characters, I couldn't put it down. Well worth my time. People have compared it to Stephen King's 'The Stand,' though I say that '8 Days' stands in its own right. Can't wait to see more from this talented author."
5,jean nate by revlon after bath splash mist for woman,"I very highly recommend this product. It is very refreshing to smell. Not perfuming smell. nice lemon smell and fresh. Love this product and recommend it to people that like that fresh smell.You don't need to use this just after a bath, can use it anytime!"
1,Is that it?,"This isn't what I'd call a 'normal' book. It reminded me of childrens books, with just a few sentences per page, trying to sound funny. To be fair, a few points were funny, but the whole book certainly isn't LOL. You can flip through this book in a short time, and singletons may be able to relate to it, but over all I wouldn't recommend the cost of the shipping and handling, in my opinion."
5,Laura Reviews: Even God is Single,"Ever been single? 100% of you just said yes since none of us were married when we were born.Salmonsohn is uniquely hilarious in her assessment of singledom, famous singles and God as a single person. If God is single, and God (if you believe in one) is pretty cool and generous, then all singles must be just as fabulous, right?Whether you're currently single, married, a raging serial monogamist, have multiple partners or (gasp!) simply want to be single to avoid the hassle, you'll love this parody. Because we were all there at one time or another. And might be again.Check out this and other reviews at: http://laurareviews.blogspot.com"
2,it was overpriced,was overpriced and not what I expected at all.......... was written more like a comic book :(
3,Too Sweet and Lacks Spice,"I didn't know that there was going to be a sugar coating on the top..seriously i didn't.When I bought these, I thought I was getting a spicy cracker, but they lack that quality in them.If I were to compare this with one of their other products it would be the snowy crisp rice cracker with the sugar coating.I like the crunch, but it's too sweet for me."
2,Poor quality,I purchased this printer because it was nice looking and advertised prints for as low as 24 cents. I was disappointed with this printer. This is an item I did not buy from Amazon but purchased at Staples Office Supply because of a rebate offer. I returned the product.The picture quality was poor. The pictures were washed out looking. The faces were white with pink but no warm overtones. You couldn't tell people's eye color. The pictures were definitely not photo quality. I compared the pictures to my Dell-all-in one and the lack of warmth (can't think of a better way to describe it) was very noticeable.HP makes good products but this is not one of them. I showed the sales people at Staples the pictures from the 8050 and everybody agreed they were poor.
2,Printing Quality Good - performance bad!,"I purchased this product in February of 2006. By October of 2006, all of the sudden, I had problems with the paper feeding correctly. I called HP, I spoke with a sales person from Staples (where the printer was purchased) and they suggested I get a cleaning kit or check the type of paper I was putting in and cross checking with how the printer was defaulted in the computer to print. I did that and it still only works if I have a certain amount of paper (not too much, not too little) and if I give the top piece of paper a little push. It is the most frustrating thing to print anything!! When this printer actually does print something, it comes out nicely, but the effort is definately not worth 6-7 months worth of use. I would suggest to keep looking!!"
1,beware of defective paper-feed rollers,"I like HP printers, but the paper-feed rollers have a defect so common that HP mails a kit free-of-charge to specifically address this problem: a plastic insert that goes in the paper tray, topped with a sandpaper-like material to coarsen the rollers. The kit works, but only temporarily. The paper feed errors returned a few months later, the kit no longer works, and HP will not do anything further once the printer's out of warranty."
1,Good printer - for a short while - Beware of HP's India Connection!,"We've owned the 8050 for less than a year - using it mainly for occasional B&W; printing. Recently, it died giving us an error message saying that the NEW ink cartridges I bought were ""incompatible"" - which of course was crazy since they were the same HP carts as before.I called the ""help desk"" and probably talked to India about 10 times with no help and seemingly no understanding on their part. But, outsourcing saves money, you know. I did a live chat with someone on HP website and though she was helpful, it did not solve the problem.They offered to mail me a new cartridge 2 months ago but got the wrong zip code for my address. After literally 20 emails, (replies from people with Indian names) the zip code problem was finally resolved and I should be getting the new cartridge soon.How can the HP ""help desk"" solve a technical problem if they can't even change a zip code!I don't have the time or need all this aggravation. Bye Bye HP."
4,Nice printer!,"I bought this printer on sale and it's a really good product. The photo quality is excellent and i've had a few people ask me to prove that my printer actually printed them. Very easy to use and set up, love the Bluetooth, makes it easier to use the printer. The Vivera inks are really worth what i pay for them, not the kind of printer you want to use if you're just going to be printing text (not worth it). The ink doesn't really last to long though. I replace the ink on this one alot more than any other photo printers i've had. Keeping this one because of the good quality! Would've given it 5 stars if it had come with the USB cable and if the ink lasted longer."
1,Piece of Junk!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"I hate this printer. I hate this printer. I hate this printer. The quality is terrible and 9 times out of 10 when I go to print, it says it is out of paper when it has a completly full tray of paper. Terrible print quality too even on the best settings after multiple calibrations and cleanings with HP photo paper. Colors are all wrong, completly the wrong shade and, visible imperfections throughout. Do not buy cheap printers on day after Thanksgiving sales. I learned my lesson. I am going to shoot this thing for entertainment then go buy a good printer, but no way will I ever buy another HP."
1,Sensor malfunction,"Even if the paper tray has enough papers in it, it says ""Out of paper, load paper ..."". I have wasted hours on this stupid issue. Seems as if some kind of sensor does not work - what a waste of money and time (sigh...) I am not unfamiliar with techies, computers, scanners, printers etc. (my warranty period has expired too).Folks looking for HP Photosmart 8050 - its a nice printer while it works, but don't go for it, its a trouble in slightly longer term."
2,Paper jams plastic part falls off,"This was a great printer, I used it for many greeting cards. When I put in the regular good quality paper, it would jam. If you fed it a sheet at a time, it was fine. I was printing about 20 sheets, on the 3rd sheet, it jammed and I couldn't remove the paper. After taking the back off, it still did not want to come out. Finally it did, but a small piece of plastic came out to. Doesn't look broken off, but paper will not come out evenly. I was told they couldn't do anything about it."
2,"Prints well, jams a lot and one more thing....","Like they said, prints fine, but jams too often. One other thing..you can use it with a usb print server (not included) for network or wireless use, but when the thing jams the message handling does not function properly, especially with Vista. On every jam, I needed to unplug the device from the print server first, then fix the jam. Otherwise the printer will keep saying that it is jammed and the network will keep not seeing the printer. Much to finicky for average user when used with a network connection."
2,Poor paper feed and frequent paper jams...,"When the paper actually feeds properly into the machine, I must say, print quality was very good. The problem is that I have wanted to put this printer through a wall on numerous occasions!!! Either the paper won't feed, it'll feed incorrectly or it'll jam..... Brutal! Currently looking for a new printer... I have seen enough other reviews reporting similar problems to know that mine is not just an isolated incident... steer clear my friends!!!"
2,Great until it breaks!,"Used the printer off and on for both documents and photos, good print quality. Had it safely stored for a year. Been using it again very lightly I might add, and the USB port on the printer died. All the sudden no printer recognition. All HP can say - is it is probably cheaper to just buy a new one."
2,Historical does not equal good,"First of all, this album is mostly a bunch of out-takes that weren't worth releasing when they were recorded. It has been in my library for decades now and while there are some major talents represented here, I would never choose anything from this album to showcase those talents. Probably better for the opportunity to check out the groups you've never heard before.By the way, Tony (T.S.) McPhee was a more-than-marginal Brit Bluesman whose band the Groundhogs backed John Lee Hooker on a tour and one album.EDIT: Please check the two comments attached for further discussion, especially since people found this post vague."
3,Good Read,I liked the book over all just wasn't crazy about it. That is why I gave it 3 stars. Good price though.
2,unsatisfying,"The literary conceit of the book is so great I admit that I am intimated. But baring my ignorance, I will say the book was tedious. The most interesting question for me was whether Edgar and Eugenia were in fact brother and sister of any stripe since they had different mothers and fathers. This moral question is very much one for our day when Woody Allen can marry his putative daughter who is not a blood relation. Was that wrong? Did Eugenia and Edgar engage in anything more serious than a sexual liasion outside of marriage. This question although presented (see page 27 for description of blood relation) is not even addressed. A lot of work to consider an interesting question that wasn't considered."
3,Medium De la Iglesia,"Not among Spanish cult director Alex de la Iglesia's best movies, this tells the tale, through almost two decades, of two TV comedians who are a very famous and succesful duo (though their act is nothing else than one of the guys slapping the face of the other guy) but who grew to hate (and really hate) each other to death. The duo is played by Santiago Segura and El Gran Wyoming, two famous comedians in Spain. Segura, the fat guy in the duo and the one who gets slapped, is famous there for the Torrente films, in which he plays an hilariously corrupt cop. This movie is only mildly funny, and I'm not sure it would travel well outside spanish speaking countries."
2,no tan cómica como las otras de Segura,"La compré creyendo que era tan buena como la trilogía de Santiago Segura: ""Torrente"" ,pero no me pareció tan buena y es muy pesada."
2,For the real Mingus fan,"This DVD is an expanded version of a section of ""Triumph of the Underdog"". Basically, it is a documentary centering on Mingus' eviction from his appartment in Greenwich Village. I was dissapointed with it since it contains very little music and I had already watched ""Triumph of the Underdog""."
2,"Mingus, Ah...Um...","As a documentary, this is a mess. As a concert film, it isn't long enough. As an example of cinema concrète, well, who knows...Interview bits with Mingus in his loft apartment are spliced with club concert footage. The interviews are mostly monologues, as Mingus spews free associative stream of consciousness juju, at one point firing his shotgun into the apartment's ceiling. Later, as he's being evicted for nonpayment of rent, he wishes aloud for the Red Chinese ""to blow you people up."" The concert material is worth watching, of course, for the opportunity to see the late master at work. But you might want to be charitable and skip the rest, unless The Ever Popular Addled Artist Effect has strong charms for you."
2,One Star quality Three Star oddity,"I just saw this movie on late-night TV. Here's my take with no references or research. I'm stunned that anyone could love this movie except as pure camp or 70s relic. Stilted acting, odd editing, novice cinematography, simple direction, cheaply made. One star. As a campy b-movie: Three stars. It's almost like a euro art movie, even Fellini-esque, except I don't think that was the intent. Are you reading this review to make a purchase/rent decision or to validate your opinion of the movie? Hmm. If you like ""normal"" movies and just want a good normal movie to entertain you, then skip this one. Too weird. If you are alone, like ""Repo Man"", and it's late at night and nothing else is on, then, sure, give it a try. Bizarre and entertaining. Archeological. Baretta as a simpleton. Disagree with any of this? Great. I'm going to sleep now..."
4,A weird slice of 1970s zeitgeist,"Here's an odd little movie with a languid pace and a very short officer who dreams of becoming a detective until he sees just how corrupt one can become when one has such power. You get a glimpse into the 1970s system vs. the common man theme here, with a detective and even regular motorcycle cops being unfair to the hippies who are just zipping along the Arizona highways, for the most part.Tragedies ensue as Robert Blake and his hair-trigger partner try to chase down a criminal. Slo-mo crashes happen. The film ends on the same lonely stretch of highway we see at the start.Interesting look into the recent past."
5,One of the best!,This one of many many very good u.s. movies in the 70ties. Very well photografed and acted. A classic!A. Pal
4,not seen them yet !,I have not recieved this video or the Shooter video as write. When I tracked them they are still in transit. According to shipping schedules I should of recieved them a week ago.
3,Up and then Down,"The first hour of the film is spot-on, totally worthy of its ""minor cult classic"" status. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is a bit of a let-down, for various reasons, including a rather preposterous resolution of the crime -and perp (excluding, of course, the oft-discussed final five minutes, which are as good as any in the film).As a murder mystery (which it is only in part) it starts out well,but then doesn't seem to know what to do with itself (unlike, for instance,""Bullit"" a film that has an urban setting but an equally fascinating lead performance/character)But Robert Blake's acting is excellent and the cinematography is fully appreciated, especially on wide-screen DVD."
5,Product as expected,"Seller shipped promptly and product was perfect. You have to pay attention to this one to take it all in, had to have it for the police collection. It may not be the greatest movie, but you can't forget the last five minutes.........catches you off guard"
4,Well done film,"Well done movie, interesting topics, but very depressing finale.Actors fit their parts, believable situations, but the downside of police work."
3,Bob Zemco,"I saw this movie as a kid and later when it was released on VHS picked up a copy of it. The movie is visually impressive and its style is more like what you would see years later in music videos. Robert Blake is excellent in this quirky yet dark story about a pint sized motorcycle cop whose ambition sees him investigating a murder case. Hippies, pigs, nymphos and detectives with erectile dysfunction are abound.I liked the movie and just remember it as being something different and not what you normally expected at the time."
1,Hit or miss,I have had this for about 4 years now. It works ok some about 70% of the time. The other 30% of the time it's a fight to get the darn thing to work at all.
2,Warrantee -- What Warrantee,"I purchased this thing in February 08, and it worked until one day in mid December then it went dead; it was working one day and the next day nothing. Went through a series of checks and satisfied myself there was a problem with the device.Called Linksys --- long wait --- talked to rep in foreign country. Several attempts at do this and that, nothing worked. It was obvious the thing no longer worked, but no RMA. Instead I got the brush off; download new drivers and call back. New drivers were identical to those already installed. Two years and a month before the expiration of warrantee I own a WUSB54GSC that is nothing more than a poor paperweight."
4,needs more info,"bought it for an older computer. had done research on it. specifically looked for windows 98 compatible. when product arrived, it suggested 2000 and higher. good thing I have another computer that needed wireless connection and met the necessary criteria."
1,It keeps giving me the blue screen of death.,"What is up with this thing? I followed the instructions, put the cd in first and then plugged the usb wireless reader in and it sends my computer screen straight to the blue screen of death. I just bought my computer and am running windows 7 on it. This sucks. I waited through a freaking blizzard for this piece of junk, only to still not have internet on my desktop."
4,Wireless Adapter,"I have bought a number of these wireless devices over the years. These are small and have very good range, allowing me to even set up a computer on my bench in the garage. Older wireless adapters would not have had that range. This one also sets up fast but on occasion the Linksys software drops the connection requiring you to manually connect. I would suggest setting it up so Windows manages the wireless connection as that seems to be more reliable."
3,Erratic,"Easy to install and working, but erratic. From time to time, it loses wireless signal. Experimented and found out that I have to unplug and plug the adapter each time to get back the signal."
4,USB Wirless,"Received it as stated. Works great for the price. Only draw back is the speed, it fluctuates from 20-30-45, not a steady 54 Mbps."
5,"Plays well with Vista 32 & FIOS Actiontec router, WPA2 fine","I didn't want to run a long ethernet cable from the FIOS Actiontec router all the way to my desktop computer in the adjacent room. So I got this little device and it works GREAT. It was easy to install on my Vista 32 desktop (big orange stickers tell you to install the drivers from the CD before connecting the device) and had no problem detecting my wireless network (5 bars). The wireless connection is super fast, maybe faster? than my laptops that in the same room as the Actiontec router. Pages popup very quickly. I can stream HULU just fine. The device itself is rather large, so I use the included USB cable to give more space around the my desktop's front two USB ports. I set the Actiontec router to use WPA2, and this device obviously has no problem with that."
5,wireless up and running,"I checked different stores for this compact wireless adapter ,they werethey ran from $60 up to $85. not amazon.com tax shipping $34.00 got it in two days pluged it in and all set,no problems"
2,"Didn't work at the beginning, but worked later on","The software (driver) seems to have some minor bugs during installation. But after all it works. The adapter at the beginning did not work, i.e., the speed is extremely slow. After a couple days, it worked fine with excellent speed on both XP and Vista OS (I tried on both). No idea the instability is due to hardware problem or driver problem. There is no perfect adapter with USP port. The best way is to have an internal adapter."
2,Not good,"I have the router that it's recommended by linksys, with speed booster, the speed is not very good and the signal is week and they must be like 6 meters apart, dont recommend this product, although it does the job."
1,Slow. So so SLOW!!!,"I had issues when I first installed this product. I needed to call tech support to just connect to the internet, and they charged me $10 over the phone to connect to my computer remotely and fix the problem (I had to disconnect my desktop computer from my room upstairs, move everything downstairs to the modem, connect with ethernet cables, big hassle). My main usage of the internet is downloading and streaming. I can barely surf the internet. At first I thought it was my computer, adware, viruses potentially slowing my computer down. But I have since reinstalled windows and my computer still runs the internet as if I'm using a dial-up modem. I check my connection status and it says my signal strength is 'excellent,' yet it takes 30 seconds to load each page. Forget about downloading anything. Streaming is out of the question as well. Definitely look elsewhere."
5,Works right out of the box,I bought this for my mother and it was the easiest thing to set up. I literally plugged it into her pc and it detected the networks automatically. She is using a secured network so I had to add a wep key but the connection manager is am extremely user friendly interface so it wasn't a problem at all.
2,Buggy software,It does work better than my Dell built in adapter but the software that comes with it is buggy. It messed up Windows XP networking.
2,Almost never works,"I bought this wireless adapter almost 2 years ago, only used it for a couple of months, is too buggy, I had to reinstall it many times and move it so it could be recognized by my computer, sometimes it works but most of the times it doesn't. Also I couldn't make it work in Windows 7 or Vista, only XP.Thanks."
5,Best marine fish food pellets,"My marine fish have done very well on the Hikari Marine-A pellets for years. I actually bought it the first time almost by accident as the local stores were out of my regular fish food. My fish like the food and they stay colorful and happy on Hikari. The expiration dates were good as well, especially important if you buy multiples as I do. I have fed a wide variety of marine fish on this food; of course you still need to supplement any single food with other foods like mysis shrimp and or seaweed etc. depending upon what is swimming in your tank :-)"
3,If you're into art history,"T J Clark is the basis for art historian argument on Impressionism but he is not the most riveting of reads. His chapters are long and his points are a bit stretched, such as his point that only one critic understood Olympia by Manet, but if you want to study Impressionism as an art historian you need to read Clark, his arguments are the basis for the field and if you read any other article or book discussing Impressionism your more likely than not to hear his name again. Also, it takes a couple of times to read him to understand his point, so be prepared for a hard read."
1,disappointed,"It was easy enough to install, but it is not anti-fingerprint....there are so many fingerprints on this after just a few hours that I can barely see the screen. There is still a glare and this screen protector makes the screen looking foggy and kind of blurry. Really screws up the resolution of the Kindle fire HD. Not bubble free either. I just got a shipping label from Amazon and will be returning this item. I was hoping they would have the same screen protector I purchased for my first Kindle Fire which was a GreatShield EZseal Plus, but they don't offer it for the Kindle Fire HD. The saying goes, ""you get what you pay for"". I would not recommend this."
3,Good product except........,"The protector went on very smoothly with no bubbles. My only problem was when I took the protective backing off to apply it, it looked like it had been used previously. There was lint stuck all to it even though there had been paper over it. I tried to clean it off some but was afraid I would ruin the stickiness. There is no change to responsiveness of screen. Would be very pleased if product hadn't had lint already stuck to it before even opened."
2,Cant see a difference,"I just received my screen protectors and can't tell a difference when reading, may as well not be on there except for protecting the screen. I couldn't get all the small bubbles out, the larger ones were no problem. I think this one should be passed up."
2,Didn't like it,"I bought this screen protector because it was cheap. While applying it I managed to get some dust and a hair trapped between screen and protector, and a few bubbles that refused to come out. I tried to use the ""applicator card"" and ended up putting scratches on it. This is one of those one chance only protectors--don't try to move it once it is down! I kept it on for a week or so, until the bubbles and dirt drove me crazy and I took it of. I haven't purchased another screen protector for my Kindle Fire yet, but the gorilla glass screen seems pretty durable, and I keep it in a sleeve or case most of the time. I will say that the screen protector did help with the annoying fingerprints that I always get on the touchscreen. So if you want a cheap screen protector that will help with fingerprints, and you are talented with applying these things, give it a try."
4,Simple yet effective,"I just installed my new BoxWave screen protector for my Kindle Fire and I am very pleased with it so far. The installation was a breeze and just like they promised, no bubbles. It is an anti-glare screen protector, so you will lose some of the crispness of the kindle's images. Not a deal breaker. I also like that you can remove it and reposition it if you didn't place it just right the first time."
4,Kindle screen cover,"Purchased this for my wife's kindle. Was challenging putting on screen, but is still effective after a year. Would recommend."
2,Too bubbly,"No matter what, we could not get this applied without any air bubbles! I've used similar products in the past without any issues so I believe it has to be specific to this product."
3,screen saver for Kindle Fire,The item arrived on time and did exactly what we needed it to do. I hope it will be strong enough to withstand my grandson's use.
1,Screen Protector -Bubblerap,"Though it was a good idea to protect the touch screen of my Kindle Fire. Trying to install it all I got was air bubbles, couldn't get them out. It was like looking at my Kindle under water. It was a waste of money."
4,Always use this quality protection,"This product is easy to install and adjust if you misalign it. The only thing I had a problem with was keeping lint from underneath the protector, which leaves a tiny bubble where the lint is, even after I cleaned my Kindle Fire with the lint free cloth provided and air in a can. The reason it got 4 stars is because it had two small, like children's, fingerprints on the sticky side when it arrived from the seller. I would purchase this item again due to the good quality and price."
5,protectors,Bye Bye fingerprints. The protectors are great! Since they were so cheap I bought multiple packs so me and my boyfriend can share and have plenty to spare.
2,What customer service?,"I received my protector in plenty of time,but I am having issues with it.I tried 2 times to reach customer service, no contact has been made. This company has not made any attempt to reach me. At this time I would not buy from them again, which is a shame since they appear to have a nice selection of items. I just would not want to go through with an order and if I had issues with it, then not be able to get help with it later."
1,Scratches easily,"Instructions said to remove any air bubbles with the Applicator Card. The Applicator Card is a little piece of cardboard. I used it to try ro remove bubbles and put scratches on the cover. This seems to scratch easily. It's also difficult to remove the air bubbles. If you get this, don't apply the applicator card directly to the cover."
2,BoxWave Kindle Fire Anti-Glare Screen Protector,"It was virtually impossible to apply this screen protector without getting dust or an animal hair caught in between it, creating bubbles you can not get out (I do have two dogs, two cats and I live down a dirt road). I followed directions exactly and tried using scotch tape as well as an air blower while applying this and still could not avoid getting a dog hair or particle of dust stuck to it. After trying to apply it myself and failing I tried to get another person's help and still got bubbles! This might work for someone with no animals and who has a dust free home! I did only pay $1.99 for this plus a few bucks for shipping so I didn't feel too bad when I balled it up and threw it in the trash!!"
1,IT SUCKS,"I bought this for my daughters kindle and it didn't stick from the beginning and contacted the company for them to give me some lame thing to do to make it stick, then asked for a picture of it what would that prove? but I still sent it and and they still haven't sent me another cover. Don't waste your time here just get it somewhere else."
1,Help,I was unable to get the cover over my screen. I read instructions and work for a long period of time and ended up throwing it away. I couldn't get it straight or get the bubbles out.
2,Impossible,This screen protector was impossible to apply and no matter what I did I could not get all the bubbles out or get the corners to stick. I even tried the trick with the tape that they suggsted and it did nothing. I ended up having to take it off and throw it out. This time around I guess I got what I paid for I bought cheap so I got cheap.
2,kindle protector,Not a good product. Impossible to get the bubbles out even in the bathroom with help from steam. Would not recommend this product at all
1,took 2 weeks to get in and isn't what seller said it would be!!,"this product took 2 weeks to get to me! once it finally got here, it seemed super nice and fit my kindle fire perfectly! however, it says it is anti-glare and anti-finger print! it is neither! the glare is worse than when i had no protector on it and the finger prints are worse, also! however, it will keep my screen from getting scratched, which is a plus! wouldn't buy this product again!"
1,The worst!,"I never write reviews, but this product is not even worth the $2 that I paid for it. It distorts the screen, everything becomes pixalated. It makes it twice as hard to use the touch features, having to push twice to get the screen to register a tap, it makes everything too dark which means the Fire has to be turned up brighter draining battery life. A much better protector, and worth every penny, is GreatShield EZ Seal."
1,"terrible shipping, bad product!","Took over 2 weeks for me to get this product....tried about 10 times to get it on the kindle....terrible, never was in line with the kindle....then it got all dirty on the edges. Stupid piece of junk...not even worth $2. Plus more than $2 to ship! The Trent product is way better!"
5,Worth the effort!,"I was familiar with the Boxwave brand by way of my iPhone. The film for the Fire is equally good. As with any screen protector film, it takes time and patience to install. It took me two films to get it right but it was worth the effort. I highly recommend this product and would definitely use it again."
4,Way better glare protection than its predecessor,"Great glare protection but one needs to also be familiar with the settings on the Kindle Fire. This device is back lit just like and ipad you will never really be able to see them at the beach. But as for reading in the car or on an airplane during the day this glare protection works! Its practical, easy to remove/clean, and a decent price. So stop acting like your at the beach every single day, and save those times for a vintage piece ie a real book."
1,awful,"I rarely write reviews, but this screen protector is awful! I read all of the instructions and I have applied plenty of screen protectors onto my phone, so I know it doesn't take more than a minute to apply flawlessly. After thoroughly cleaning the screen, I applied it carefully to the screen. I noticed some bubbles, so I used the enclosed card to squeeze them out. I even tried using the skotch tape trick as illustrated in the instructions. The enclosed card scratched the screen and now I have more bubbles than ever. It looks really cheap and scratched and the words on my kindle are extra blurry. It is anti glare and anti fingerprint as promised, but I would trade all of those options for a clear invisible screen protector, even if my fingerprints are all over it."
2,Simplistic,"The other reviewers here that reference their 13 year olds enjoying this book are absolutely right. This book is for 13 year olds. As a 25 year old trying to wrap his mind around programming, it leaves much to be desired.If all you want is a gloss-over for someone who has no intention to continue in the field of programming, but just wants a non-programmers understanding of programming, this book is for you. If you want something you can take with you on a journey into real programming, you will have to really dig deep to distill the few morsels of theory offered here. In fact I had to reread most paragraphs dozens of times in order to find the underlying concept he was trying to teach; to find something that would still be useful to me after finishing the book.Bottomline: A waste of time if you are out of high school and attempting to truly learn something about programming. Take a few minutes to skim thru the pictures at your local bookstore, then go buy a real programming book."
3,Soooo close to being good,"This is one of those almost movies. The lift has some positves going for it. Dark humor, clever script, and a few creepy moments. Unfortunatly the movie is just way to talky. I found myself getting impatient while wathing the lift and I am by no means an impatient veiwer. Its one scene after another of people having conversations. I almost forgot I was watching a thriller. This is unfortunate because there is a solid movie somwhere in the middle of all this."
5,GREAT Movie!!,"My friend and I love cheesy horror movies, and if you are one of those people, this is a must have for your collection!! It is dubbed, but made in Germany I believe. Very well made!"
3,The Company You Keep,"The Company You Keep: The Transforming Power of Male FriendshipInter personal covenents are important, and may be explicit and/or implicit. One is the basis for the other. The book does not bring this out.Found the book shallow in its references to Christ and the Holy Spirit.What should be their involvement in our friendships> how should we use their grace and lessons to help?"
4,Look in the bottom of the package for USB extension cable,"The Spot Mouse appears to be a travel mouse redecorated and now sold as a mouse for children. As such, the cord is very short. Be sure to look in the bottom of the package for the USB extension cable that Logitech includes."
1,Great content --- shame about the 1950s typography,"The visual execution of this reproduction is inexcusable (product link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YMMCNO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img). The only ""High Quality"" of this copy is the cover.The only reason I have not returned the book was because I disposed of the packaging before I go to opening the book.However the material itself is superb and would deserve a properly printed new edition (at an affordable price --- are you listening, Institute of General Semantics?)."
4,Very Cute and Useful,I purchased this Gelly Belly and the Honey color. The Black is actually cutier in looks and both are very soft... My son was having teeth issues and we needed to keep heat on the sore spots... The Gelly Belly Bears worked great! and kept the heat for a while and was so fun and cuddley that he kept the heat on without any prompting.Later we tried freezng the pack and using it for cold therepy - the cold did not seem to penetrate the bear and was not really useful that way. I still gave it 4 stars because for heat it is awesome and my little boy loved it!!!
3,"Really cute, but not very effective","This product is really adorable, however, we have used it two or three times now as a cold pack for injuries on my kiddos, and the cold sensation doesn't transfer very easily through the cloth of the teddy bear holder. This is disappointing to me because the last teddy bear ice pack we owned had a slightly different design but was far more effective at making boo-boos feel better. We haven't used it as a heat pack yet, so perhaps that function will prove more effective. At the very least, my kids still love to hold the ""boo-boo bear"" when boo-boos occur, so that makes it a worthwhile purchase:)"
3,Not cold enough,"I couldn't resist this little cutie. When I got it in the mail, I immediately froze the gel pack so I could use it that night. When it was finally frozen, I had a heck of a time getting the gel pack back into the bear. The openning is just too small. Once I wrestled it in, I placed the bear on my knee. It just doesn't feel cold enough. The fur that feels so nice is a barrier to the cold. Kind of sorry that I spent the money on it."
4,Good action,"My only complaint with this movie is that it felt too short. If they would have extended it past the one hour mark I think they would have been able to get more out of the plot line. It moved like your typical action movie, sort of a cross between Bubblegum Crisis (anime) and Enemy of the State (live action). Tokyo Vice definitly had some action packed scenes. Overall an enjoyable hour spent."
1,Poor at best,"I give this product a poor rating. The packing case is nice, but little else. The included plastic bottles are available from various retailers and are adequate. I do not like the Lexan eating utensils, which seem to have a greasy feel even after being washed with hot soap and water at home.Worst of all are the pancake turner and cooking spoon, which are not heat-resistant in any way. The tip of the cooking spoon melted immediately upon contact with the bottom of the small pot I was using when attempting to stir ramen noodles. The ""pancake turner"" melted and stuck to the griddle surface as I was trying to flip pancakes. By the time I was finished, all three edges were completely melted and small patches of plastic were adhered to the (non-stick) griddle surface.I would not recommend this product.Edit >> This review does not reflect poorly on this seller. I purchased this product elsewhere."
4,GREAT BOOK!,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR MY SISTER-IN-LAW WHOSE SON (MY NEPHEW) JUST GOT DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. SHE LOVED IT; SHE COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN UNTIL SHE READ IT. SHE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY HELPFUL. SO I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.
5,a family account from both sides of the glass,"While many books on autism tell either from a family or individual's viewpoint, this story is unique in that it presents the perspective from both sides. Paired with the mother's account is one of her son with autism. This was written during a time when autism was still between psychoanalysis & neurology so some of the interventions seem misguided (although acceptable at the time). When Sean reaches high school & begins to recognize himself as an autistic indiviual, it is an unusual awakening. Good family-account/personal-account reading."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Unnecessary, slow, and often downright boring, Rocky II is only worth watching if you really need to see the Italian Stallion beat Apollo Creed (by standing up better!) or if you love the franchise."
3,Good Sequel,"The first sequel to the rocky movies is straight after the first one, after he fights Apollo (Carl Weathers) who is being accused of losing to Rocky, wants a rematch against Rocky, to prove himself. It isnt as entertaining as the first one, but still is very good. Rocky's also gets married to his wife asrian and has a kid, and also Rocky become more known in this one."
4,Enjoying a Rocky Marathon with my 13 year old Son,"My son came home from school wanting to watch the Rocky movies after his social studies teacher showed a clip at school of the first movie. I really didn't have any interest, but decided to watch it with him anyway. We both really enjoyed the movies. I will say that Rocky 4 is my least favorite. Seemed too unrealistic, but the first 3 were great. Good family time!"
4,Rocky II,"Ordered this because it was on t.v. with commercials and it has been a really long time since I watched these movies. The first 2 Rocky movies are pretty much classic but after that, they are just o.k. They were shipped rather quickly as I always get the super shipper and it comes way faster than you think. Amazon is awesome with that!!"
4,Best sequel of the series,"While I think that the original film Rocky stands on it's own because of it's beautiful simplicity, the sequels givbe us more of teh characters we fell in love with. In this film , the character reaches a new kind of low because he learned that proving himself once isn't going to solve all his problems. Some of the saddest moments of the series(Adrian's coma, Rocky's rejection from various jobs) and the most memorable(Rocky running with the kids up the steps, ""Adrian I did it!""). It had the best choreographed fight of the series , an intense battle in every sense of the word. My only complaint is that the movie sometimes comes off as too sentimental to the point where it feels corny and Rocky's character becomes something of a joke--in the first one he was a little dim , in this sequel he seems comedically retarded. However , these points do not take away from the overall enjoyment of the film."
3,GOOD SEQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL 3 1/2 STARS,"I own the older box set with the first 5 Rocky films included in it. I wanted to write reviews for the individual films. This review is for the film and the older release DVD.Interesting sequel, but it does feel as if we've been there before. Once the film get rolling you'll still be cheering the big lug on!The DVD I own has a OK transfer, but there is room for improvement."
3,"""Superfight II"" Delivers a Wallop","Though a step down from the 1976 Oscar winner, ""Rocky II"" fares better than most Hollywood sequels. Calling the directorial shots, Sylvester Stallone gets a bit carried away with montages and could have used some judicious editing (the Adrian hospital vigil goes on forever). However, the Rocky-Apollo rematch is a genuine crowd-pleaser - excitingly filmed and more brutal than the original. Burgess Meredith chews the scenery with gusto as Rocky's crusty manager. Classic dialogue: ""You're a greasy fast, 200-pound Italian tank! Go through him! Run over him!"""
3,The Sequel Without Surprise,"This movie could not have been anything different, but it could have been executed better. If you loved the first Rocky, you will probably find some enjoyment here, but not much else. It is excruciatingly predictable. Even if the characters are still a joy to watch.This series died with the first Rocky. Not that I am a purist, but the story was summed up and realized in the first. This was supposed to be a story about personal triumph, not about winning. This is just capitalization. One can not stay mad too long, even after the films ridiculous opening sequences, as Apollo's bombast and newly threatening character does not allow for it.Again, excellent character actors, but that does not fix this mistake of a sequel. The story is drawn out, overly simplistic and irritating. After the first ten minutes you just want to witness the actual fight.There is a reason why Apollo did not want a rematch, folks.Get it discount."
3,SEQUEL IS REALLY AN UNOFFICIAL REMAKE OF THE FIRST MOVIE,"ROCKY RETIRES FROM THE WORLD OF BOXING. BUT AFTER HE FINDS THAT HE CAN'T GET A REGULAR JOB, HE EVENTUALLY RETURNS TO BOXING TO FIGHT APOLLO CREED IN A REMATCH. SOAP OPERA-TYPE STORY KINDA BOGS IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT, BUT THE CLIMATIC REMATCH BRINGS IT BACK ON TRACK. REALLY AIN'T NO DIFFERENT FROM THE 1ST MOVIE, BUT, IT'S STILL AN OK MOVIE TO LOOK AT."
1,Just a poor remake,To see Rocky doing the same things again is just plain boring. And how come Stallone didn't seem his usual self in this film. It should have been titled :Rocky 2 How to ruin a good film
5,Great Movie,This is a really good movie. I enjoy the fighting. They did a great job on Rocky and the other guys make up. I think the baby they got is too cute and looks like his acting parents.
4,Rocky II (1979),"Well, it had to be made. Rocky has to win the title, right? Of course! As I've said before, I'm not a fan of sequels although I do make exceptions and this is one of them. When you have such a good screenplay and character depth with a movie, a sequel can be great. (i.e., The Godfather Part II) Rocky II is a very good movie in it's own right despite having the familiar title of ""Rocky"" in it. Unlike Rocky II, far too many sequels have you thinking back to the original instead of thinking about what's ahead and for this reason they fail."
5,Rocky II (1979)-You're going down. No way!,Rocky II (1979)-Rocky does it again in this great five star sequel. Made with many of the production values of the original and as entertaining as humanly possible.
4,big hit with my curious daughter,"I bought this for my daughter as she is very curious about word origins and mythology. A great addition to her library. Very easy to read. A pick up and put down book... if you know what I mean. She feels the explanations are a bit shallow, not going into depth much, but still fun as a cursory read."
2,eh - ok but not that great,It's ok but some of the jokes are offensive and pointless. The general story is nice and the pics interesting but the jokes he stuck in are unecessary and distracting. Well most are. There are some that are not dirty and cute.
5,Telling it like it is!,"Willie- Outlaw - Not a chance. Willie tells it like it is. This was one super book. Not the usual boring run of the mill books you never finish. I got started and couldn't put it down. The road, song writers, past experiences, and dirty jokes. Super since of humor."
3,Wow - he has kept his sense of humor,"I ordered this book out of curiosity. I was well pleased. There are times this book drags. There are times this books jokes are so old, they may have been new when Mr. Nelson was a boy! However, I found it fun, refreshing, and just plain relaxing to read. I would warn you that some of the humor is definitely for adults and if you are offended by raw humor this book is not for you. While I personally was offended once or twice by a joke I still enjoyed the read."
1,Disappointed...,"...is the only word I can come up with to describe my feelings after reading this book. Although Willie's stories were entertaining and I did chuckle at some of them, there wasn't enough of them. More than half the book is made up of the lyrics to his songs. If you're a Willie fan like I am, you would already know the lyrics to all his songs. Sorry, Willie. You missed hitting the fairway with this one."
3,Mixed feelings,"Songbook, diary and autobiography. You can look for each song on Youtube or similar and give yourself a private concert, or you can simply read them as poetry, sitting at a cosy fireside, in a wood, on a hill, or wherever you feel comfortable and meditative. Diary and autobiography are endearing by their candid honesty, telling in a matter-of-fact way about his blessings, successes and shortcomings - the latter with a roguish twinkle, being sure of the indulgence of his audience.Having delivered my praise, why just 3 stars? Sorry, but European women of my generation are ingrained feminists, so some of the dirty jokes are simply unacceptable. It's just a matter of cultural divergence - I know rather blasphemous jokes which I gladly share at home, but would never dream of telling an American.At last, a tiny correction (p. 167): You won't find the Proverbs in the New Testament, they're in the Old!"
2,For The Die-Hards Only,"The same basic material he has already covered in his autobiography ""WILLIE"" back in 1988, and the song lyrics have already been published in other retrospectives. An enjoyable must-have for Willie completists to be sure, but an otherwise repetitive, pointless book. And I am a big Willie Nelson fan."
2,"Willie can do no wrong, but this is close.","First, let me state emphatically that I am a huge Willie Nelson fan. He is, by far, my favorite recording artist and I have seen him in concert three times. That said, there is not much in this book to recommend it. There are a few very funny jokes, although not that dirty. There are dozens of simple, yet profound, song lyrics, mostly of his lesser known works. As a reader, I would have preferred to hear Willie sing them. Willie tells you he is in favor of the family farm, God, marijuana, less government. He is against smoking. He plays golf and jogs. Everybody seems to be his best friend. But, if you are a Willie fan, you already know that. And there's the problem. I didn't read anything about him I didn't already know. Damn, I wish he would really get serious about writing an autobiography. There is so much I would love to learn about Willie, but it's not here. Save your money and buy another Willie CD."
5,A GRASS-ROOTS MAN WITH A FASCINATING STORY,"What stood out among the pages of this book was Willie's down-to-Earth, grass-roots character. He is a man who has often lived on the edge, had his fair share of ups and downs but still manages to come out on top. His songs are popular because they come from the heart, just as this book does. The further one gets into the book, the more it begins to feel as if Willie is right there along side of you, and you are just listening to an account of his trials and tribulations. He brings life to his adventures and readers will get a fair chuckle from his jokes - some of them clean, others not ones you would tell your younger children. Willie comes across as a simple man with a devil-may-care viewpoint and a unique style that is one hundred percent pure Willie. For fans of Willie Nelson, this book is one you will not want to miss."
4,Peering Into The Mind Of A Legend,"I must be one of the few Texans who is not a huge Willie Nelson fan, yet there are times when I really enjoy listening to his songs. I always recognized that Nelson was a great songwriter, but I never thought of him before as an author.OK, it might not seem like its too difficult to write a book like this. Mix in some song lyrics, a few jokes, a few personal stories and blend in a few anecdotes and you've got a book. Nelson actually makes it a book worth reading as he shares his wit and observations on sundry topics with his fans. The words seemingly pour from his pen with aplomb as he writes in such a winning manner that the reader will not want to put the book down before finishing it.This is not great literature, but as you read and laugh along, you can't help but feel that you are peering into the mind of a legend.After reading it, I came away with a new appreciation of what Nelson is all about. If you like Willie on any level, you should enjoy reading it too."
1,Yuck,"Willie Nelson Should stick with singing and thats that. I Did not find this book enjoable at all I do not recomend it at all.If you liked this book check out all of Willie Nelson's, Books, Music & Movies."
4,Fantastic trad,"More great stuff from a terrific and tight band. Dervish is something different. This CD isn't as great as At the End of the Day, but it still has some wonderful cuts on it. They emanate sheer energy and passion for true trad and are a joy to listen to. A must."
4,A crisp salute to Von Ryan,"I haven't read many World War II novels so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I really enjoyed this book. I thought the story was excting and was written at a brisk pace, no endless filler. The main character, Ryan, can be hard to root for at times, but in the end he has the best interests of the 1000 men he's leading at heart. I really liked the character of Colonel Fincham who is insubordinate to Ryan at every turn. The detail of what it was really like in a POW camp were excellent, and the same goes for later in the story when the men are herded like cattle into train cars. Von Ryan's Express is a quick read and tells a compelling story."
4,von ryan's express,"Great book, David Westhiemer is a very informative and interesting author. The detail and accuracy in the story are superb. It was almost as good as his other book, Song of the Young Sentry. The story catches you and won't let you go until you finish, then you drool for more."
3,Survivor Series 93 REVIEW,"The 1993 Survivor Series was the first and only WWF pay-per-view held in the historic Boston Garden. It was also the first time I attended a WWF pay-per-view. After some negative feedback from the previous year's event, the WWF wisely returned to the winning formula of four-on-four elimination tag action.The 1993 series saw The Macho Man entering as a substitution for Mr. Perfect, another chapter in the Bret Hart-Shawn Michaels feud, the beginning of the Bret vs. Owen feud, and the elustrious moments where Lex Luger joined up with Santa Claus(?). We also got to see the Bushwackers and Men On A Mission dressed up like Doink The Clown and The Heavenly Bodies win the Smoky Mountain Tag Team Title.At the time, this was one of my favorite PPV's but time has not done it justice. Today's fans may not enjoy it as much but it was still a hell of a show."
4,WWF Survivor Series 93,"Match #1.Razor Ramon,1-2-3 Kid,Marty Jannety&Randy; Savagevs IRS,Diesel,Rick Martel&Adam; Bomb.8/10Match #2.The Harts(Bret""the hitman""Hart,Owen Hart,Bruce Hart&Keith; Hart)vs Shawn Michaels&his; knights of the squared circle.8/10Match #3.Smoky Mountain Tag Team Championship.The Rock&Roll; Express vs The Heavenly Bodies.6/10Match #4.4 Doinks(Doink Luke,Doink Butch,Doink Mo&Doink; Mabel)vs Bam Bam Bigalow,Bastion Booger&Head; Shrinkers.7/10Match #5.(The All Americans)Lex Luger,The Undertaker,Steiner Brothersvs(The Foreign Fanatics)Yokozuna,Crush,Ludvig Borga&Jaques.9;/10"
1,Just say no to Survivor Series 1993,"This event is just as bad as WCW's Greed PPV back in 2001. There were many substitutions that hurt the matches so badly like Randy Savage subbing for Mr.Perfect,HBK subbing for Jerry Lawler,Crush subbing for Quebecer Pierre and UnderTaker subbing Tatanka. The Worst matches on the card were The Family Feud match & The 4 Doinks vs. Team Bigelow match. No good matches at all at the PPV. By the way,NONE of the 4 Doinks were Doink himself. The main event between The All-Americans(Lex Luger,Undertaker,Rick Steiner & Scott Steiner) and The Foreign Fanatics(Yokozuna,Crush,Ludvig Borga & Quebecer Jacques) was bland and the confrontation between Luger & Borga was boring as a Ed Wood movie. I give this event a 0 out of 10."
3,Doesn't work well with Flax Seeds,"This grinding mill seems to work very well for grinding hard foodstuffs like peppercorns, and has a coarsness setting, which not all grinders have, but doesn't do a very good job with softer materials like flax seeds.Also if you cannot tell from the description or pictures, it is manually operated, and is not intended for grinding large quantities at once; so for grinding pepper I stick to pepper mills with rotary handles instead. That being said, the contsruction of the tool is pretty solid, I'll up my rating once I find something to actually do with it :)"
5,"great for salt, pepper and more","I bought three of these mills--one each for salt, peppercorns, and coriander (although it works well for coriander, I don't use it enough and I plan to experiment with a mix of Italian herbs instead). I have been using them for two years now and they still look like new and have continued to grind well after daily use.One thing that these don't work well for is moist ingredients. Grinding flax seeds won't work and neither will grinding moist sea salt (like Celtic sea salt)."
5,Perfect grinder for salt and pepper,"Bought this for my husband for his birthday, because he wanted a good grinder that had a lid. This was the only one I could find and he loves it. It works great and they are heavy duty!"
4,This is the one my husband likes best.,"My husband like this one best because it has a cap & does not leave a small residue on the table or counter. I found I have to have a small tray underneath the others. Also the grinder itself is of high enough quality that we expect to be using these (we bought 2 - 1 salt & 1 pepper) for +++years. We have 4 different sets of salt/pepper grinders. 1 Kitchen, 1 dining, 1 breakfast nook, and 1 on boat. 2 are Vic Firth (that we absolutely love). Unfortunately 1 set, although was $50, not a quality name & don't expect to last many more years. This WMF set is on the boat and not only keeps the table clean without a tray underneath, it is small enough to store well that I don't worry if we have a rough boat ride, yet is large enough that I don't have to constantly be filling them up. Only reason not 5 star is that I'm not a fan of white, but it works."
2,Sea Salt Grinder,"I keep it on my table for company, but actually, it grinds so little, so slow, I don't use it myself. I thought from the ad on it I had at last found something that would grind sea salt (This is the third kind I have bought)but I'm still not satisfied. I doubt I will try any more brands. I may buy a mortar and pestle, which is what my son uses at his house."
5,Stainless Serving Set,"This, and the other Lenox Vintage Frosted flatware I ordered through Amazon.com are wonderful -- but I'm prejudice...it was my selection of the pattern and I am very picky about the things I spend good money on!! So this stainless is very exciting to me, and I am glad to have the full set, which now includes also the hostess set and a total of 12 place settings! May want some extras at some point of the serving and hostess sets."
1,Really BAD -- Not a Training Book,"This book is really misleading. If you expect to learn how to do web programming from this book, forget it!!! At best this is a decent reference book. This is not one of those how-to-do books. The examples are short, and this book has no step-by-step lessons for learning. You will not be able to teach yourself ASP.Net programming from this book.The only way this book is good is as a supplemental textbook in a class with a teacher going through the material. If this book had sections for step-by-step self-teaching, then this book would be good. This book is sorely lacking in that area. The cover says this book is for training. That is very misleading.If you need to purchase a book to teach yourself how to do ASP.Net programming, do NOT buy this book!"
3,Good Reference Book,"I thought it was a good reference book - not one you could read cover to cover. It seemed to jump around a bit more than I liked. It covered most of the need-to-know topics.I tend to work in the source code window more than the design window, and this book tends to do the latter. It's not a bad thing, it's just different.All in all, it's a good book, but some of the topics/concepts seem forced into the application you are creating throughout the book."
2,Misleading Reviews,"I purchased based on the reviews here and now realize they must be paid reviews. So much talk about another Murach hit, and 'This book continues the Murach tradition'. What a bunch of baloney. This is a decent reference book - thats it. Don't purchase thinking you'll learn to actually build something beyond the most simple site. A fair reference but 'Easy to read, using the ""paired pages"" format' that every review raves about is not as good as having an actual excercise to follow. Bottom line - do you want to read 800 pages or do you want excercises that will lead you through the process of building a site?"
2,Not for a Beginner in a Hurry,"The book goes into a lot of theory and gives a lot of good background, but I needed to learn this today and get something coded up for the boss by tomorrow. I couldn't wait until I finished Chapter 4 like it says on the cover. I ended up getting what I needed from Evangelos Petroutsos ""Mastering Visual Basic 2008"", Chapter 26, and had something up and running in just a few hours. The format of the book sounded good when I read the other reviews, but I changed my mind after a few pages. The right hand page just reiterated what the left page said, sometimes with relevant pictures. But, in the long run, it just seemed to make the book twice as big as needed."
5,Good Intorduction to ASP.NET,This book is more for a beginner and it teaches you the essentials of ASP.NET before you could start thinking of learning the advanced concepts in ASP.NET. I'm just like a starter with some basics on VB.NET and ADO.NET and this book was really helpful to me and very quickly I was able to develop my own ASP.NET applications.As I said before this book assumes that you have a basic knowlede on VB.NET. If you lack in that then this book is not for you...I gave this 5 stars because it imparted what I expected.Hope that this review was helpful.A beginner better look for some other options.
1,Could not get Ch 3 to work,I read the rave reviews and bought the book. I cannot get the Chapter 3 exercise to load despite trying all the obvious permutations. I wonder if this book was sufficiently road tested.
5,Beautiful Music from China,"12 Girls Band will be familiar to most in the US as the group that was performing Chinese music at the end of the Closing Ceremonies of the Athens Summer Olympics in 2004. The group performs on traditional Chinese instruments, the er-hu, the pipa, the dizi, and the zheng. The members are classically trained musicians who normally perform in traditional Chinese orchestras. Nevertheless, these musicians show their versatility and liveliness through their performance in the 12 Girls Band. Their fresh sounds comes from an updating of traditional Chinese music with a contemporary music sound and rhythm. Not only are they able to thus make Chinese music more accessible (and listenable) to Western ears, they also perform Western music (both symphonic and popular, including the jazz great Paul Desmond's Take Five) through a Chinese music prism. 12 Girls Band is tremendously popular in China, and through exposure, this group should rise in popularity here."
1,Beautiful & Eastern Energy DVD's,"After purchasing both of these vd's and cd's. I found that I cannot play either of the dvd's. I receive a wrong area message.I would like to know what area I'm in, and if I will be able to return these dvd's and receive correct ones."
3,The Body by Stephen King,This book was purchased for my 12 year old son who loved watching the movie Stand by Me. He enjoyed the book and the ability to compare and contrast it to details in the movie. He was disappointed in the delivery time for receiving the book and in the length of the book itself though. After waiting a number of weeks to receive it he was able to read it in one short sitting.
2,The Body- not as good as I expected,"I had decided to read the book, The Body, after viewing my favorite movie, Stand By Me, learning that this movie was based off of the book. I had high hopes for this book because the movie is so fantastic, but it really let me down. It didn't hold all of the meaning, and coming-of-age feeling that the movie did. Some parts were similar, but it definitely didn't touch me in the way I expected it to.I also love Stephen King, and find his writing very good, but this one, well, it wasn't his best piece of work."
3,It is missing....,"I am an avid King fan and thought this book would be wonderful to teach to my High School Special Education students as a coming of age story. The students did enjoy reading it, but so much was missing!! The story had been altered to fit the reading needs of 5-6th grade level readers, which is very clear in the discription. I felt as though it cut out too much of the story as it was lowering the readability level. I would have rather had the students struggle through the original so they would better see character development.Penguin has lowered the readability in more than one book and I appreciate it greatly. Special Education students need high interest, low readability material... but I feel too much was cut from the original story (as found as a short story in the book, Different Seasons)."
4,Delivers what it promised,"Installation including drivers etc. took about 30 minutes on my xp machine. No glitches. I was able to capture video from my VCR, make edits and add some transitions, graphics etc without consulting the manual!The user interface provides useful information and from what I saw, I probably wouldn't try to run it on an economy type computer. The manual recoomends a second hard drive to write to but I haven't had a problem using just one. Would recommend a lot of RAM (More than 512mb if possible) and the product will take advantage of hyperthreading if your computer has it. If you've got xp, a big hard drive, a lot of ram and an HT capable processor I know it works great. Can't vouch for anything less though.I've used Windows Movie Maker, Pinnacle Studios and Sonics software (I forget the name)- The software with this product isn't any harder to use, maybe a little easier and the hardware works as promised. I paid around $140.00, I'm pleased"
1,"Poor product, worse service","I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. First of all, the editing software doesn't even load on a computer running Windows Vista. Next, I have been trying to get the card to work with Vista for weeks with no luck. The support page from Turtle Beach is worthless and the E-mail tech support is no help at all. I will never buy a Turtle Beach product again."
1,Hardware Conflicts and Unusable,Installation was fairly easy and straight forward but once I turned on the PC is when the problems started. It had a major conflict with my Video Card and everything was in 4bit colors and wouldn't go beyond 800x600. Once I pulled the card it werked fine.......support on the TB website is worthless cause there was nothing there that was even vaguely close to my issue. E-mail support is equally worthless.........if their support was better I would keep it but since it is practically non existant except for extremely generic issues I chose to return this.Great concept but extremely poor execution.
4,its ok,"Not a bad collection of songs we have here, but I tell you comparing this to the ultimate Kansas theres plenty of filler here .You get some unreleased live material an unreleased demo of Can I tell and the song Wheels(which is great). The live version of Death of mother nature suite sounds very poor in quality, Incumudro is a reasonable live recording and it really rocks at the end and On the other side is pretty ordinary (like the guys had a tough time keeping time on stage). The rest of the CD is Like a best of but still not ideal. Get this if you see it inexpensive."
4,The rare American entry in a mostly-Brit form,"What is prog rock? On the one hand, it was the mix of classical, jazz and rock done mostly by English acts during the '70s. Today, Dream Theatre serves as a reminder that metal was in there as well. But in Kansas, we had a third influence--R & B. These guys apparently listened to The Rascals along with their Brubeck, Tchaikovsky and Deep Purple. They really took up where Vanilla Fudge left off, minus the theatrics."
5,Excellent jambalaya,This mix taste like you have cooked for hours. It is delecious and i havebeen buying it for years.
3,If you've seen the show...,"...then you don't really need to read this. It's essentially a novelization of 5 or 6 episodes; ""Backwards"", ""Marooned,"" ""Polymorph,"" ""White Hole""--but oddly enough, bears little or no similarity to the eponymous ""Better Than Life."" The first half of the book is original; the second half, taken piecemeal from the episodes above (some of the dialogue is verbatim)--but without the actors' comedic talent. It's okay--but not a must-have."
4,"A little brother to ""Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers"".","Following the success of its prequel, Better Than Life charts the four crewmen of Red Dwarf through their deepest and most amusing fantasies. Although very funny, and further enhanced in places by an almost Quentin-Tarantino-esque plot line, this book is neither as comic nor as credible as its precursor. This is due in part to the fact that the first half of the book is a pure fantasy within a fantasy, and real laws of existence are totally disregarded, and also to the fact that almost none of the book even vaguely relates to the series, without which there would have been no Red Dwarf cult following anyway. Certainly, BTL is original and amusing, but hard-core Dwarfies will become somewhat confused over its frequent departures from the plot."
5,BEST SMEGGIN RED DWARF BOOK EVER,"this book goes so fast. i read it in an hour, but i was laughing for days afterwards. it is great. really. rimmer, lister, cat, holly, kryten(hate him), and talkie toaster all magnified times 300x!"
2,The only really good RD novel is the first one.,"This has a few moments, but not too many, frankly. Still, it's better than the horrible Last Human. I suppose I would have to say that Backwards is somewhat better, though. Oh well."
2,"Far below ""Red Dwarf""","This book is a way to pass time. Not a very nice way, tho. Compared to Red Dwarf, this book has nearly all protagonists (Lister, Rimmer,The Cat) acting completely out of character. The begining was amusing: you pick up where RD left off, in the Better Than Life game with our ""heroes"" trapped in a fantasy of their own making. Then the book runs out of gas."
2,bob the book critic who hates books,this book was terribly boring its about a little girl who goes and stays with her uncle because her parents are dead dont buy or read its horrable i though it was going to be a goodbook i guess not but i like action books if you like slow boring books here you go.
3,great product packed in bad smelling odor,"These are good underwear, and I have bought them before. They are just not a product you want to wear or put away anywhere around other clean clothes until you have washed them once or sometimes twice! I bet many people are turned off by the smell considering its suppose to be a brand new item. But I can assure you that the smell does wash out thank God!"
5,Comfortable & easy to style,This has got to be a deal of the century. It is a comfortable wig and sets when it is styled and it is not too much and just enough Marilyn. Excellent for the money.
1,Star Wars Episoce II: Attack of the Clones -- The Visual Dic,"Actually my son loved the book but it fell apart as did all the similar Star Wars books. (He is not hard on books, our pop-up books all survived his early years intact.) I bought a copy for the library at my son's elementary school and that one fell apart too. These books are to expensive to have the binding be so shoddy."
5,DOUBLE PAGE SPREADS = DOUBLE ENJOYMENT,"What a cool book for all Star Wars fans! The photos are dazzling, rich in details, full of the characters and gadgetry envisioned by George Lucas. Each photo is annotated and the pages are crammed with facts - surely enough to satisfy even the most avid aficionado!The author and members of the DK staff spent some time at Skywalker Ranch, Lucasfilm's California headquarters as they met with the film's creators, propmakers, and stunt coordinators. Such research is obvious in this superb resource.The double-page spreads are great for browsing, amd the inside information is fascinating.- Gail Cooke"
5,Great Book for photo references,This book gives anyone who loves to draw the Star Wars characters invalulable poses and views of all of the hardware and characters. I have been using these books to create my own Star Wars posters and you can't get better detailed photos anywhere else.
5,great selection of Woody Allen film music!,"I think this is probably the best of the Woody Allen film music CD's ( a double CD!!!), with a wide range of tracks from ""Alice"" through ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" to ""Celebrity"". Hard to pick a favorite because they are all great but some of my favorites are ""Taking a chance on love"" performed by Ethel Waters, ""Manhattan"" performed by Carmen Cavallaro Trio, ""Poor Butterfly"" performed by Red Nichols and his Orchestra. So many jazz treasures all on 2 CDs!"
5,like nothing you've ever read,"I don't even know how to start describing this novel; I've never read anything like it. It's not science fiction, but it's not ordinary fiction either. It's lofty, epic, and mythical but it's also completely basic, earthy, and human. You'll see why I'm struggling to describe it when you read it--it's such an imaginative blend of fantasy and reality. I guess the closest I can come to describing it is that it reminds me of a Magritte painting: it looks totally realistic but can't, quite, possibly be, in a way that makes you think. And it's not just the way the world is so close to ours in some ways and so different in others, although I love the way that's done so deftly and unobtrusively--there are the stories and personal histories compelling the characters to be the way they are that's so fascinating to watch."
4,Noah Redux,"This book is not for the faint of imagination. It is a juxtaposition of otherworldly images. It requires a mindset turned away from the status quo and geared up for high adventure. Your prejudices are best left at the check-out.Prepare yourself for every turnabout from the philosophical gay hero and his sister Noah who tends lions, to a rain God, a whale divinity, and creatures who live in a volcanic cave feasting on mushrooms and wine.This writer has hopscotched past Don DeLillo and brings a new and original voice to the art. She has created her own mythology. ""The Ark"" is ready for boarding. Are you brave enough to sign on?"
4,Dream is over,"Sequel to ""Billy Liar"".Billy Fisher, about 15 years older, still hasn't reached London. He is married(has a mistress too), works in City Council in some town similar to Stradhoughton and still lives in his own world of dreams. From person who appeared in ""Billy Liar"" only his mother is present.After a series of crazy episodes Billy, whose wife is expecting a child finally decides to grow up.Keith Waterhouse shouldn't have written this sequel.First, as usual with sequels, it isn't as good as first part.Second, a character like this is not convincing while growing up. Can you imagine a sequel to ""Catcher in the Rye"" with Holden Caulfield growing up? The same with Billy Fisher. He should have been left in Stradhoughton or/and in Ambrosia.It doesn't mean that ""Billy Liar on the Moon"" is bad. It's still very good and worth reading although as I said earlier not as good as ""Billy Liar"". So 4 stars instead of 5."
5,Texas girl,"Smoking Hopes, was a book I could not put down. I could relate to the author, I grew up in Texas. One can see the talented un- commercialized writer that reaches out to a literary reader, and reality reader. Can not wait for her next book.H. Treulieb"
3,A basic guide,"A good basic guide book for campgrounds in the northwest. What this book lacks is a way to evaluate campgrounds before you get there. Ya, it gives you the facts but it is hard to distinguish the enviromental factors (road noise, etc.) until you pull in with your tent on a Friday night. It is best to supplement this book with guides such as:""Camping! Washington : The Complete Guide to Public Campgrounds for Rvs and Tents""which give a general feel for what public campgrounds are more desirable and why."
4,"Camping, all you need to know!","Foghorn Outdoors offers everything you need to know about campsites in the Pacific Nortwest as well as helpful hints on medical needs, camping gear etc. It's like no other campbook guide that I own! The ease to look up sites by name or by activity is great, you can go directly to what you are looling for."
1,Worst Blu-ray transfer I have seen,This a a very bad Blu-ray transfer to an excellent movie. Almost as bad as my VHS version. The sound quality is OK. I think that HD DVD is better at remastering DVD than Blu-ray.
2,Rocky,"poor acting, okay fight scenes, all of the other Rocky's are betterdoes not measure up overallRocky 2 through 4 are better movies"
4,Der Champiun,"ROCKY UN BOXER IN THE UNITED STATESHE GET TO BE A BOXER IN GYM UN TRAIN TO FIGHT ZE BOXERS ROCKY VERY STRONG UN FAST DRINKS PROTEIN UN EGGS UN JOGS TO BECOME FIGHTUER PUNCHES MEAT IN DA FREEZUR TO BE BIG UN STRONG HE GOES ""HUMPH-HUMPH-HUMPH-HUUUUMPH!""

PUNCH-PNCH-PUNCH NOCK OUT UN WINNER!"
2,THIS ONE HASN'T AGED WELL ...,"You have to give Sylvester Stallone credit for writing himself a starring vehicle, and then getting it made. He also more or less created the ""Sports Underdog TriumphsIn The End"" genre. That said, that fact that this embarrassingly over-acted film beat out ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, BOUND FOR GLORY, NETWORK and TAXI DRIVER for theBest Film of 1976 is absolutely mind-boggling, and becomes more so with each passingyear. Strictly for Sly fans, and anyone who wonders what was in The Academy's drinking water that year ..."
5,Great Film,"Heart-warming classic that nevertheless should not have beaten out Network for the Best Picture of '76. Still, the original Rocky cannot be missed. Stallone turns in an uncharacteristic marvelous performance, as does the supporting cast. It is unfortunate that such a wonderful film has been sullied by so many lackluster sequels (especially Rockies IV and V). The original is a beautiful tale that is told in a simple, yet effective fashion. Whereas in the other films, the fight is the main part of the story, in this one, Rocky the character is the central focus. And, of course, Burgess Meredith is perfect as Mickey, the tough but lovable boxing manager. This film is well-deserving of its AFI Top 100 ranking."
5,Rocky is one of the best movies ever made!,"Out of all of the movies that I have ever seen, and I've seen plenty, Rocky was, by far, one of the best, along with it's many sequels. It's a great story of the power of determination and that if you really really want to go the distance and you try your absolute best, then anything is possible. The Rocky movies are probably the only movies that I can watch over and over and still have the story pull me in. It was excellently written and acted, and definately deserved that Best Picture Oscar. Everyone should see this movie!"
5,Great Movie,Hubby always liked this movie. I never payed it much mind. But today I couldn't figure out what to watch. So I pooped Rocky in and really enjoyed it. I can see why he likes this movie. This is a great movie. I'm happy we own it.
5,Great Movie,This is an American classic that deserved to be honored with a Digibook release. I loves this movie and it looks and sounds great. My only complaint is that the packaging on the disc itself sucks. It is just a sleave. I like the digibooks with the plastic case that snaps the dis into place and holds it better.
2,Going tru the same things,"Whats the meaning of buying the Blu ray if there are no extras, especially for older movies.The same old marketing trick is on again. They will first publish plain movies (again) on BD, then they will publish director cuts, then collectors editions, then special editions etc. etc.I will not buy any BDs just because they are plain BD copies. Consumers should demand more content in BDs."
2,Blu-Ray version,"This rates as my all time worst HD video transfer, I would not be surprised to find that it has been transfered from a VHS version of the movie as it is so bad. There is bucket loads of grain, total lack of definition it is just absolutely terrible."
2,YET ANOTHER double dip,"How many times can the same movie be re-released? There is no justification for this other than to grab more money from fans' pockets (and of course to tie-in with the past-its-prime 6th Rocky flick coming out). I bought the original Rocky DVD box set, because I am a fan of the series. Then there was the second set that miraculously appeared with ""improved video"" or whatever. Now, Rocky is rererereleased in a 2-disc version, and the second box set is being rererererererereleased. WHEN WILL IT END? When will one release of a movie be the final one? I'm tired of the big ""screw you"" to fans."
2,Block head,"I know many people consider this an inspirational movie. I remember seeing a group of students at school discussing just how great this movie was, how inspiring, how positive. After viewing the movie myself, and trying my best to be upbeat about it too, I never felt this way about the movie. In fact, I thought it was stinko. Seldom could I understand just what rocky was saying, since he seemed to be talking with a mouth full of ham sandwich all the time.What is the basis of this story? A guy, severely outclassed in ability and experience goes up against an impossible foe. It is an old plot of amature vs pro and the amature winning. So what. There are so many movies that use this plot - outnumbered, outclassed, outeverything vs what appears to be an unbeatable foe. Many of these movies do carry this through and show how the beaten down can sometimes come back and win it all. These are the ones to see, not rocky.I do not recommend this movie to anyone seeking an inspirational movie.Joe"
1,Not exciting like the sequels,Stallones accent doesn't help either. Strange enough the sequels were far better. The problem with this film is that it drags too much.
1,Rocky,"This is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Sylvester Stallone is not that good of an actor, in my opinion. He's not the worst actor ever, but he's definetly not the best. The main reason why I gave this movie 1 star is because the showdown between Rocky and Apollo Creed at the end is very disappointing. I was expecting a big climatic boxing match, but I was appalled at just how boring and short it was. Rocky didn't even win the damn World Heavyweight Championship belt from Apollo Creed because the referee stopped the contest too soon. Right before the credits at the very end of the movie, Rocky looks so retarded screaming, ""Adrian!"" over and over again. What a lackluster conclusion. I've heard people tell me how the climax of this movie gave them goosebumps. Well guess what? I didn't get one single goosebump! The ending to this movie sucked! Nearly everybody else seems to think that this movie is just the greatest thing they've ever seen, but I don't."
3,DVD sound quality very disappointing,"I loved the movie, but the sound quality of the DVD leaves much to be desired. If you own the video, don't bother paying twice and purchasing the DVD."
2,Blu Letdown - What was the studio Thinking,"How could they NOT include extras or an extra disc in a $30 Blu Ray release?There's a 30 minute interview with Stallone on the DVD version that is one of the best extras I've ever seen included in a film. Why they would leave that out is beyond me.Listen up, studio execs - give the customer what he expects, especially for an item priced at a premium."
5,Great entertainment,A major movie of the 70's. One of the best actually. Stallone puts in a great performance as well as the supporting cast around him. Fell good and heart warming. An all time great gets a superb DVD transfer as well. I've never seen this movie look so good.
5,One of the greater films ever done,"One of the greater films ever done.Period.It's a touching and highly emotional little movie about determination, courage and the power of love.It gives important messages and lessons in every scene, and it also made every guy believe in their dreams and wishes.Rocky deservedly won an Oscar for Best Picture and despite what film snobs tend to say, it must be one of the most special movies ever brought to screen.It's impossible not to cry with the story of a simple minded boxer who gives his best to go the distance with the champion and finnally prove something to himself: that he isn't just another bum fro the neighboor.Buy this great DVD now!"
4,Rocky Video,"Excellent product, very pleased. Overnight shipping was a bit shakey. The item was delivered to the wrong house. It seems that some of the drivers do not pay attention to detail, such as Road and Drive. If I wasn't watching the online shipping status I would still be waiting for the item to arrive."
4,Rocky not Rocky,Surprisingly good picture for a movie that looks poorly on analog or digital TV. I guess they have an old print.
5,Great Movie,"Rocky is,plain and simple,a great movie.The story(which everyone knows by now)is wonderful,about a two-bit prize fighter from Philadelphia,who gets a shot at the heavyweight title,and ends up going the distance with the champ. Sylvester Stallone is magnificent in the role of Rocky,and all the supporting players(Talia Shire as Rocky's very shy girlfriend Adrian,Burt Young as her brother Paulie,Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed,and of course Burgess Meredith as Rocky's manager Mickey just to name a few)are equally as good.John G.Avildsen's direction is right on as is Sly Stallones writing. The musical score by Bill Conti is fantastic as well.The 25th aniversary DVD is very good,and priced reasonably.There are some nice special features including trailers(from all five movies)and TV spots."
5,All-time classic,"Fantastic packaging for one of the best films ever made. Worth it for the Stallone commentary alone, but it's loaded with quality extras."
5,Rocky Special Edition,Quite simply the best version of Rocky 1 ever made. This version has extended scenes that you do not get with the regular Rocky. This is a must have for anyone who loves the Rocky Series. Even if you have Rocky 1 you should still get the special edition version.
4,Rocky: Not Just Another Boxing Movie,"For many, the title ""Rocky"" is synonymous with a bunch of muscular, sweaty, bonehead men beating each other up. I didn't expose myself to this film for a long time because of that stereotype. After my brother talked me into watching it, I discovered immediately that the stereotype was not ""Rocky""! If anything, boxing is a subplot. This is a movie about the human spirit, personal pride, and success.Rocky, who's been through hard times and will continue to go through them, represents everyone in their struggle to prove to themselves that life is worth living and that they can do anything they put their minds to. It's a great movie that keeps us cheering for Rocky Balboa as he fights his way to success and happiness with his life."
3,Great information by not of Maya Glyphs,"Hello readers. I have studied Martin's book very diligently for the last couple of years as I was attempting to understand the art of the Maya and how it spoke to us today and in particular about the calendar, its ending and beginning. Then saw this listed here as understanding Maya Glyphs which makes it sound like it is related to the 20 day signs or what we call the Maya Glyphs which it is not. It is rather a deep Martin Brennen interpretation of Maya art and hand signs in particular as they relate to the meanings of the storys and concepts represented in the particular drawings from funeral vases, paintings, petroglyphs etc. Be prepared for an interesting experience but if you are looking for definitions and explanations of the 20 day signs, try Kenneth Johnson's work, Maya Astrology. Enjoy these deep learnings."
4,Fascinating,"Sometimes brilliant, sometimes sketchy - but always interesting. Great, detailed Maya glyphs and mythic scenes. Recommended."
4,My new favorite deodorant,"Before I tried Dove, Secret was the only deodorant for me. Now, I have a new favorite. Dove has a nice fragrance that does not overpower any other fragrances you wear. Only a little is needed to keep you dry and confident all day long. I was already hooked on other Dove products...namely the soap. Adding this just seems to be a natural progression in purchasing good, quality products."
3,Loved it in the beginning...,"It does not irritate my sesitive skin, but after a few months it stopped working. I liked it enought to try it again, but am a little skeptical. There is never a good time for your deodorant to fail, but especially not on an airplane (where I work)."
5,Quintessential New York,"If you dog it, you've obviously never dared to live it. This movie is true poetic genius on all fronts.One of my all time favorite films."
3,Slaves To Art,"Big hair, loud colours, 80's music, and funky hats. Slaves To New York captures the essence of the eighties in a New York party circuit kind of way. I marveled more at the clothes and the hair, and turned a deaf ear at the soap opera that was unravelling before my eyes. Watching all those artists play bed tag with eachother didn't seem to phase me. It's all so passe in the art world.I loved Bernadette Peters and her constant array of feathered and bowed hats, and the film did supply some awe inspiring shots of New York city skyline. Steve Buscemi provides a cameo as a fashion designer, that was kind of interesting. But like i said before, the hats took center stage in this spectacle. Along with Bernadette Peter's bravado, Slaves of New York is a slice of 80's big apple pie."
5,The Best movie for Childhood,"This has got to be the best movie that I can date back to my youngest years of life. It has been a part of my life and now I have given it to my 2-year old nephew to share. This movie is very touching. It will bring back so many memories if you have seen it as many times as I have. I can still remember the grouch anthem. And that being my favorite part of the movie, still to this very day. If your kids love sesame street, than they'll love this. It will make you laugh, cry, and cheer with excitement. This is a must have for all you sesame street fans."
1,Disappointed,The DVD does not work on any of our DVD players. Bought it for my daughter because she fell in love with this movie on Netflix. Sad it don't work.
5,Classic,"It brought back memories of seeing this in the theater ( when it was affordable to go!). Love the movie and so does my LO. She calls anything from Sesame Street, ""Bird."" I just find it amusing that Elmo is on the cover..... He wasn't in the movie! Sad SS had to use Elmo to sell a great movie."
3,not worth it,"My daughter doesn't really enjoy these much, while other videos capture and keep her attention, this sesame street video does not. It seems super dated and low quality. would not recommend."
2,"Not very good , kinda boring","Its OK but not really exciting and kinda redundant my son is Sesame St all day every day, but gets mad ay this one"
5,Follow that bird,"I received the item in a timely manner. It was received in great condition. I do not know if it works, our DVD is disconnected"
3,This item was mis-described by Amazon: no French version,"The description says the movie's audio track is available in French, Portuguese and English, but in fact it's available in Spanish, Portuguese and English. Since I ordered it to have a DVD to watch with my son, who's in a French immersion program, this was very disappointing.The movie is fine, but the description is faulty. Unfortunately, I can't find any way to let Amazon know that other than this review."
1,got item broken,i have no idea how this movie is and cant really rate it. i bought it a long time ago and it was broken but never got a replacement. looks like a good movie for my kids but we wont ever find out.
2,Good-but be careful,"I remember watching this as a kid and my mother even has pictures of me balling everytime it came on. This movie has made me scarred for life...everything goes wrong over and over again and takes forever to let up. Poor Big Bird...give him a break. If your kid has a big heart and pitties others easily, do not let he/she watch this alone. I still get teary-eyed when he sings ""I'm a Blue Bird."" I don't think this movie is for everyone...be careful, at least watch it with your kids and pay attention to their reaction. If you kid(s) don't get sad at that part...you should think about what all they've been exposed to and make sure he/she still has a heart. I'm serious(...)"
1,thoughtless,This is a terrible story about adoption. Big bird is adopted by a family he doesn't like so he leaves. What kind of a message is this about adoption? Its also a very negative portrayal of the family that takes him in. Don't buy it. I threw ours in the garbage rather than let anyone else watch it.
5,Granddaughter Loves It,"My granddaughter loves this movie just like my kids did. A Classic!! Mitt Romney should check this movie out. If he had followed that bitd, he might be president elect today."
5,Great Item for kids.,"I bought this product for my daughter, and she absolutely loved it. I recommend buying it for your kids, they will be excited to watch it too."
2,Not the one you want...,"Well, at least not the one I would want... There is another Karaoke / backing track version of Avenue Q available (cover art is a street sign). While this CD does offer both complete tracks and just instrumental tracks, I find the ""instruments"" to be too synthesizerish, mixed poorly, and sometimes even playing the wrong notes/chords! Listen to the track samples on each CD yourself and decide which you prefer!Avenue Q / The Musical"
2,Buy the Rough Guide,"Having used rough guides for years we wanted to reduce the books we were carrying on our travels through mexico and central america.This is our first experience of the footprint series and we are very disappointed with it. We spent a frustrating morning in mexico city recently trying to find shops listed in the guide which proved not to be there or in the wrong street. Its understandable that places will move or close down but the sheer number of mistakes we{ve found indicates that the publishers have rushed out the 2002 edition without fully checking facts. The guide also lacks the wit, verve and accuracy of the writing in the rough guides and doesnt make for particularly interesting reading."
3,Not Kelton's best...,"This is the fifth Kelton book I have read. He is a fine writer, maybe the best of our western writers. This is a good entertaining western. The characters are well drawn, but it is just average for Kelton. The story just kind of wanders around. The plot is reminiscent of ""The Searchers."" I'd read ""The Good Old Boys"" first."
4,Deeply recommended avant-garde sounds,"This is a DVD which contains two short avant-garde films made by Dick Fontaine in 1966 and 1967. Together they make 55 minutes. I have not purchased the DVD, so I cannot comment on the quality of the disc itself, but I have seen ""Sound??"" (1967) which features John Cage (narrating) and Roland Kirk (playing music and exploring sound.) It's a nice piece which encourages keeping an open mind towards new, different, evolving, eccentric, avant-garde music and the exploration of sound. Cage questions what ""sound"" stands for and whether simply ""sound"" is music or not. I recommend this film to open minded listeners and to musicians who are into other things than practicing rudiments and scales to a metronome 10 hrs/day. Unfortunately I have not seen the 29 minute long ""Ornette Coleman Trio"" yet, but know that it was made in 1966 and features the Ornette Coleman Trio with David Izenson and Charles Moffett recording the soundtrack of ""Who's Crazy"" in Paris."
1,You've got to be kidding,"These books were useless. I was expecting to get some insight into the new exams, but was shocked when I saw these books. It's like MCSE Cliffs Notes. Where is the real-world Microsoft demands? If you think you are going to read a book, take a test, and be ready for the real-world, you are in for a shock. These books are useless. Spend some real money, and don't look for the shortcut."
5,Excellent Guide,I was able to pass all core MCSE exams with less than 10 hours of study per exam and with little experience administering NT/2000 networks. There is no reason to pay for classes when any reasonable intelligent person with a decent background in computers can pass the tests using just these books.
4,A must have to those who want certification in less time !!!,"I'm an entry level systems consultant, I just have less than six months working with windows 2000. I own this pack and passed my first exam (70-210 for the first time) without the need of a 700 page book. I recommend this pack also if you are on a dead line and don't have too much time to read 700 - 800 pages. Good explanations and easy to read and covers all of the exam objectives."
2,He's Taken It Too Far.....,"First off, I am a huge Ellroy fan. I've read all his stuff and honestly regard him of one of our great writers.However, for whatever reason, he has gone way too far with his use of the language, especially in this book. Alliteration every once in a while is one thing, but lately, especially I would say since American Tabloid, it is starting to make his work unreadable. It seriously gets in the way of the story he is trying to tell.If you want good, classic Ellroy...read the L.A. Quartet. This later stuff is getting to be a pain to read. Come on James, enough already. (Lee Harrell)"
1,The worst thing I read in 2004,"If, like me, you're a fan of James Ellroy, here's the good news: apparently he's at that level of stardom where publishers package up his dross and market it as gold. I was primed to write up a good old-fashioned rant about this book, but just read the other reviews and you'll get the gist pretty quickly. Destination: Morgue is a compilation of half-baked nonfiction pieces (most of which will be old news to anyone who has read My Dark Places) and three truly, embarrassingly awful novellas. And just because they are written badly on purpose doesn't make them any less horrible. On top of the painful prose, Ellroy takes his standard Post-WWII Racist Cop Thug caricatures and plops them in modern L.A. It doesn't work. At all. Like watching a man on a high-wheel bicycle ride in the Tour de France, it's just ridiculous.If you've never read James Ellroy, I recommend you stay away from this and start anywhere else. And if you have read Ellroy, well, just stay away from this."
1,Just didn't like it,"This was my first Ellory book and it will probably be my last. Is the author as strange as his writing suggests by what appears to be much autobiographical storytelling? Are the folks in California really this strange? I tried, but I couldn't even finish the book."
3,a mind boggle of literary languge,"I BELIEVE JAMES ELLROY IS ONE OF THE BEST WRITERS IN ANY TYPE OF GENRE....I FELT THE THE STORIES (BOTH THE FICTION AND NONFICTION) WERE GOOD, INSIGHTFUL, AND ENTERTAINING. THE ONE CRITICM THAT I DO HAVE IS THE REPETITIVE USAGE OF LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT FAMILIAR TO THE AVERAGE PERSON. THOUGH THE LANGUAGE WORKED WELL WITH SUCH THINGS AS THE SCENES OF THE CRIMES AND THE MOOD ELLROY WAS SETTING, THERE WERE TIMES WHERE THE LANGUAGE CAN CONFUSE THE READER. OVERALL IT WAS A FUN AND INTERESTING BOOK, DEFINITELY A MUST READ FOR CRIME BUFFS."
3,golan fights,"Anymore, Rick Loves Jerry, or any other wildcat mcJagger snarfed croak with. It's a Kafkaesque kind of Dickensianism, except when Stephanie's eyes and mouth and. O crysse"
3,SO DISAPPOINTED,"My husband got me this beautiful tea kettle for my birthday last May. I have loved and used it daily since. I had the reviews so I really followed the directions for care and use. I will say I disagree with many reviews, you do fill only to below the spout but thats still plenty for 3-4 cups of tea, and as long as you dont overfill it never dribbles all over it pours right into the cup, so great functionality. However, today, I have now had this tea kettle for about 8 months and I have discovered a huge chip in the enamel that somehow burned right off! I always use medium heat so this wouldnt happen and the chip is near the spout right under the fill line, about the size of my thumb, and not even touching the heating element. Im heartborken! I was hoping there was some sort of 1 year warranty but I cant find eveidence of 1...for $60 I would NOT purchase again!"
3,"Product: Awesome, Service: Not Awesome","I couldn't wait for my new tea kettle to arrive, I drink tea daily and had been suffering along with a broken kettle that burned my fingers and had a broken whistle. When the box finally arrived and I opened it up, the kettle was GORGEOUS. Except for a pencil eraser sized chip in the enamel. There was no return form in the box, and all of the information online instructed me to use the ""enclosed easy return form."" After some research, I found a customer service email to write to. The response I got was that customer service was really busy, and they were sorry but they'd get back to me in 3-5 days. I had probably 3 email exchanges with this department with 3-5 days in between each. Finally they offered to send me a new one, within 10 business days. Today is the 10th day, let's see if it arrives. So the moral of the story is, I ordered this kettle about a month ago and am still waiting for it. So much for the convenience of ordering online..."
4,Something to say,"I bought this book because it was on sale and the cover looked good,. The book was pretty good but i finished it in like a couple of hours.I used to read alot of VC Andrews books, mainly the old ones like Heaven and Flowers in the Attic series All of her books are about a ballerina or rich parents., or a weird stepmom or grandmother..That one Demtri kid was a perv though. Janet didnt talk much in the book,too.I felt really sorry for her when she had her period on the day of her audition. I hope the second book Crystal is as good as this one or better!"
2,One of my first disappointments in a long time,This book was good but not as good as all of her other books I have read. I have read all of her books up to date and am currently reading Crystal. I wish the books were longer and that more books would come out. It seems that you get done reading a book and you have to wait almost a year for another to come out.
2,"not enough of a punch, more like a slap","This book was quite a disappointment, it was not in the regular style of V.C. Andrews. Although I found this book to be somewhat of a disappointment i will continue to read the new installments."
4,Four Stars to this Ballerina,I believe this book gave a great description of a broken life of an orphan and goes into great detail. I believe that it is a great way to start this series.
3,Kinda confusing but alright,"The book was alright, at some parts though, i found it confusing. LIke where did Dimitri go? After what he did to her, u think they would be encountered again. And the father was protrayed as this nice and caring man, u wouldnt think that he would just leave her at some foster home!And Janet had no self-esteem! I would have liked a character with some kind of personal outlook. The book was a quick read with some kind of plot that was mysterious to me!"
2,"Entertaining, but not a heart-felt book","The ghostwriter definitely doesn't match the original V.C. Andrews style, but this book was...interesting. The parts with Dimitri were intriguing, but beyond that I wouldn't have even read it and thank God I didn't buy it but picked it up at my local library:)"
5,I couldn't put it down! Better if familiar with ballet.,"This was a REALLY awesome book. It's probably more interesting to those who take ballet. A girl is adopted by a family. The mother was a prima ballerina but was in a car accident. Now, Janet is expected to become the girl that her new mother never was. Excellent!!"
1,Just lame,"Butterfly is the first novel in ""VC Andrews's"" Orphans miniseries. I would strongly advice any one against buy this dull, silly litte book. The heroine is pathetic, annoying and not worth reading about. I am also sick of ""Rich people are evil"" which happens in every book of the Orphans series. Very tiresome of Andrew Neidermann to have such tired old stock villains."
2,Butterfly: Falling From the Sky,"Okay, this book, is poorly written, clichéd, and all of the plot twists can be seen from miles. So, why did I buy the book that contains all four of the Orphans' Stories? Because even though they aren't very good, there are scenes that are decent enough to be read once in awhile.Janet ""Butterfly"" Taylor, an orphan, is a adopted by Celine and Sanford Delorice. Celine wants Butterfly to be a dancer, just like she was, before the car accident that crippled her. However, Janet is not her, and the results of trying to force the eager to please girl into the Pointe shoes, are disastrous."
3,Can't wait for the next one.,"I think this book was pretty good. I along with everyone else preferred the original V. C. Andrews books. I also agree that this series seems to be more horror like the ""originals"" . I really can't wait for the new Melody book that should be really great. You know though I would have liked to have read about Melody's mother and grandmother like in Garden of Shadows."
2,A major let down,"I couldn't believe ir when I read this book, I expected so much and I got nothing. Butterfly (Janet) gets adopted, moves, goes to ballet, then leaves. That's it nothing else happened. The reader does not find out anything about Janet's past, the family she's with, and nothing major really happens to her. I think the V.C. Andrews ghost writer(s) had better rethink what they are doing to her name, because their story writting is going down hill big time. I was a major fan, now I couldn't care less. What a let down to the V.C. Andrew name. Ghost writers learn how to write, your lossing readers!!"
1,Teenage Drivel,"No substance, The ghostwriter has seemed to have forgotten that V. C. Andrews has adult readers, and he is putting us out to pasture for a new ""younger"" audience. Disappointing childish drivel."
1,Disappointingly Short,"I have read almost all the books published in the name of Virginia Andrews.Unfortunately I found this book to be a bit short-lived. If it had've gone into a bit more depth, like her other classic storylines, I wouldn't have had a problem, however the end came too soon."
3,not as good as the rest,I thought it would be more of the gothic style. It was too short and didn't explain much. Much was the same in some of the other books and it was especially similar to Brooke. It was kinda unrealistic cause you just can't send back a adoptive child back..can you...
5,it was great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i thought that this book was great !! i thought that it would be scary because of the cover , but it wasn't . i loved the way v.c.andrews explanes everything to you so well and the way janet explaned what she was thinking . i would give this book to anyone !! i strongly recomened this book to anyone and everyone !!"
2,Hopefully It'll Get Better,This ghost writer hopefully will get a clue. You couldn't even get into the head of Janet cause she was a bland character who went along with everything. The writer doesn't give the main characters point of view on anything and leaves her extremely underdeveloped. Still....there was one major event in the book that made me squirm anxiously so I recommend this book for anyone looking for an easy read. But if your looking for moving and poignant plot writing steer clear of Butterfly.
4,great story line sad ending,"I think the Runaway series is the best series I have ever read. I liked the drama and the story line. I read Butterfly because it had dancing in it, and then I got addicted. You will also be seeing my review on raven."
3,Two many stereotypes and familiar plotlines but still fun,"If you're looking for a quick read and something not too serious you might like this book. However, Butterfly seems to be a rewrite of many other V.C. Andrews books. For starters, there are too many stereotyped characters: the snobby grandmother, the wild uncle, and the cruel kids. Excuse me, but I've had much worse problems than Butterfly did and nobody ever picked on me like that. Kids are not really as cruel as adults imagine them to be. Mrs. Delorice seems in many ways to remind me of Kimmy from ""Heaven"" (sorry if I got the name wrong). Also, Janet never really seems to love dancing as the back cover suggests. It seems like she is just doing it to please her mother, not because she wants to. If you want to read a good V.C. Andrews book I would recommend Heaven. Unlike Janet, Heaven is a strong character who faces poverty, abuse, and criticism, but grows into a beautiful woman who I can not help but admire."
3,Somewhat Boring,"I hope the following books are more interesting. The characters were barely developed, and then they were gone. It didn't really leave me even caring what happened to Janet. But the storyline did stray from the normal ""VC Andrew's"" Book. If the stories were more developed I think they'd have potential to be just as good as any of the other EARLY series."
2,I Don't Recommend This Book!,"This is a very short book for someone age 12 or younger. I'm deeply dissapointed with this book series! I agree that they should go back to V.C. Andrews ""original"" format. It's totally different from her original books! If you really want to read a good book, check out Flowers in the Attic."
2,Not that great,"I've read all of V.C. Andrew's books but stopped after reading Secrets of the Morning. Why? Because the stories were beginning to all look alike: dark secrets in the family, incest, main character never getting along with her parents etc... it's as if the writer is following a recipe! Butterfly's plot was so predictable because characters were so 'stereotypical'! There wasn't much of character development... Well, maybe in a 170 pages novel you can't do much of it. But then, if you can't or won't develop the character, what's the point of writing the book??! The name of the school that Janet went to, Peabody School, isn't it the same as the school Dawn went to?? I mean, how original... Reading Butterfly, I got the impression that the writer didn't put much thought into this and wrote the book just to make quick money. Cheap shot!!"
2,This does not belog in the horror section!,"This was the first book I have read by V.C. Andrews and maybe it was a bad choice. I always thought V.C. Andrews wrote scary stories but this book proved me wrong. I know that it is hard to write scary scenarios in books, but this was just not scary at all! I found this book disappointing as a horror, but satisfying as a drama. In fact, I found myself crying! But then again, I cried in Bambi. Enough said."
3,"Sort of a let-down, but an interesting book nonetheless","I've always been interested in the Lee family of Virginia, especially Richard Henry and Francis Lightfoot, the Declaration of Indpedence signers, so I ordered this book, hoping it would give me an insight into the world the two lived in. The book did, in a way. Some of the best points were when the authors described the society of Old Virginia, the relationships between the Virginia families, and how the colonists lived. Thankfully, the authors did a good job of portraying Richard H. and Francis L., but after that, the book sort of went downhill. I definitely did not enjoy how the authors portrayed Henry 'Light Horse Harry' Lee. He came off as some whiny, simpering man, and it really annoyed me. But, other than that, this book is a great insight into the society of Old Virginia and a fair look at the Lee family, and their roll in our history"
3,Companion (not soundtrack) to the CMT Crossroads TV show,"I was really disappointed -- partially my own fault -- because I bought this album after seeing the CMT ""Crossroads"" TV show with these two. I like them both. Bruce Hornsby's solo work is incredibly strong, and his piano playing with the post-Grateful Dead band, The Other Ones, made me like him even more. And Ricky Skaggs . . . anyone who likes bluegrass like Ricky Skaggs. But the TV show ran a setlist with ""The Way It Is"" and ""Uncle Ben"" and ""Old Valley Road,"" and the versions of those songs were great . . .BUT . . . I didn't read the song listing before I bought, and those songs aren't on the CD. I bought the CD so I wouldn't have to watch that TV show to hear the songs. Don't get me wrong the record is a good one, but I wish the producers had put the good songs from the TV show on the CD. I can't think of any reason not to."
4,Polished Talent,"These gentlemen are simply polished talent. This CD is fun and truley calms the savage beast. Our two dogs lay out, relax and listen to the perfect mesh of piano and strings. I first purchased a copy for my parents, and then a few days later bought one for myself. Enjoy!"
4,Really fun CD,"Long time Bruce Hornsby fan, my wife is from the Shandoah Valley so she made me a fan. Since we live in Appalachia, can't help but know about Ricky Skaggs but I never was a fan until now.These guys kinda trade songs back and forth. Lots a fun to listen to. ""Dreaded Spoon"" is one of the funnest but the best is SUPERFREAK. Yes, the Rick James classic.You gotta hear it..."
2,mandolin rain carries this CD,"Unfortunately, I found no other tunes from this duo worth a second listen. Personally, I found the CD disappointing. I guess artists would do well to stick to singing their own hits - once we get accustomed to listening to a successful song - we don't settle for remakes that don't hit the mark."
3,Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby,"I'm a big bluegrass fan as well as a big fan of Bruce Hornsby. Ricky Skaggs is new to me, and I found his songs to all have the same twang and nasal sound to them. I would have liked the CD better without the lyrics."
1,One of Ricky Skaggs' Worst!,"I am huge Ricky Skaggs and bluegrass fan, and I am surprised at how bad this CD is. Unless you are a fan of Bruce Hornsby, you will probably not like it. Do not buy it based on the fact that it is Ricky Skaggs, which is what I did. If I was Skaggs, I would be embarrassed to have my name on it.The songs where Skaggs is featured are okay, but I would consider it mediocre work for him. The rest of it I could not even listen to. I had to skip most of the songs after listening to the first 10 to 20 seconds. It is that bad.Most of the CDs I buy are excellent, and again I am a huge Ricky Skaggs fan. I am floored because I rarely dislike CDs as much as I dislike this one. Plus, I am even more disappointed that it is a Ricky Skaggs album.I recommend you preview it heavily before purchasing. If you think you will like it, then by all means buy it. I wish that I had previewed it first because I would not have purchased this album based on that."
5,Good ol swingin bluegrass,Nice pairing of Hornsby and Skaggs . The CMT concert was great and so is this cd. Lets hope the duo will tour together too. Good stuff buy the cd and enjoy.
5,It's all good!,"If by chance you like bluegrass and you enjoy the piano work of Bruce Hornsby, you can't go wrong with this album. It's been on constant rotation in my CD player since the day I bought it. There's not a single song I would skip over, and that doesn't happen very often! Piano, mandolin, guitar, fiddle, banjo--it's all here and it is exquisite.As other reviewers have said, don't expect the same-old same-old, especially when it comes to ""Mandolin Rain."" I didn't like it the first time I heard it because it was so different from the original, but now I can't even remember how the other version goes. It's all part of the Skaggs/Horsby magic!"
3,My Wife Likes Jim Nabors,It's a very good cd; I probably would not have bought it for myself; but my wife loves this and the following Nabors cd and listens to it all the time. It was delivered as promised and in perfect condition.
1,horrible,a very poor book filled with strange ideas. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone seriously interested in bowhunting. I found it impossible to finish reading the entire book.
1,The cause not the cure,"Racism and xenophobia are the cause of the problem, not the solution. We are part of the world. The author seems to have forgotten that we are a great country, and should behave like one, not run away scared and shut the doors."
4,The Truth,"Leave it to Regnery to publish a book about the truth...contrary to other ""BIG"" publishers....."
1,Propaganda,"Plain and simple. The writing style is atrocious. I enjoyed watching Malkin get put in her place by Alan Colmes and the immigration attorney. Her rhetoric consists of manipulation and tired Smear tactics. By no means is this a good read for the level-headed, thinking person. If you want real facts check out""A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present"" by Howard Zinn instead. You'll thank me for it ;)Oh yeah, and For anyone that calls me a flaming liberal, I'm an independant thinker. I don't blindly follow liberal or conservative idealogues. Y'all end up hailing Bill Clinton or Ann Coulter! Keep walking in lockstep."
1,Braying Michelle Fires Another Salvo of Crapola,"The shelf life for this brand of hatemongering is very short. And obviously Michelle knows this since she churns out error-filled polemics almost as fast as Ann Coulter.The only people who buy, let alone read, this drek are already singing in Michelle's ever-dwindling choir.Have fun ranting, folks."
1,This book attacks everything america stands for...,"Ms. Malkin annoys the reader to no end about how the US is being invaded by illegal aliens who - in her ""opinion"" - all became instant Democrats. Makes even Ann Coulter look profound."
1,"Michelle Malkin is a biased ""journalist""","Michelle Malkin's pathetic excuse for journalism is disgusting. Purchasing this racist, biased, terrible thing she calls a book will only feed her to continue. She has posted numerous stories with outright racist remarks and it's gross. Pathetic at the most. Her ""blog"" online is a prime example of that.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK"
3,Malkin is right -- we are ALL terrorists,"In this brilliant book, Michelle Malkin makes the point that we are all invaders She acknowledges that we are all illegal immigrants, alients, criminals, and terrorists. And she is right about another thing, too. We should send ourselves back to where we came from. I wish other people thought as clearly as Malkin and realized that it is not all about ""liberal"" and ""conservative""."
1,A waste of paper,Definitely a book that was thrown together in three months. The author did not read primary source material such as a GAO report but rather quotes from a Washington Post article discussing the report. Lots of conclusory statements not backed up by fact. Not a book I would recommend for a rational discussion of U.S. immigration policy.
1,A legitimate topic ruined by baseness and demagoguery,"I was acquainted with Michelle and her husband when they lived in Seattle. They were nice people, and suprisingly liberal. In fact, the rumor (very believable to me after reading this) is that Michelle deliberately writes in a base, shrill, and obnoxious fashion in order to *discredit* conservatives. I knew Michelle! She was much brighter and more compassionate than her journalistic style (based largely on soundbite simplification and name-calling) might reveal her to be to those who don't know her. In fact, Michelle IN PERSON constantly impressed me with her ability to see an issue from both sides, and to understand its complexities and subtleties. I really wonder if it is true that she is a liberal masquerading as a conservative in order to embarrass the latter."
5,DOES THE LAW MATTER ANYMORE?,YOU WILL BE SHOCKED AND OUTRAGED BY THE INS FAILING TO DO ITS JOB TO PROTECT US AND SIMPLY UPHOLD THE LAW.
5,NOW WE KNOW HOW BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHY!,"Ms. Malkin who writes for the Washington Times would have received an automatic ""ignore"" from me until I saw her on Charley Rose and bought the book the next day. The incredulous story she tells about how terrorists are still being welcomed into this country every day, because our Federal Government cannot seem to grapple with a systematic methodology for barring entry to those who present the potential for a clear and present danger, is nothing short of insane. The hypocracy of claiming the need to go to war with Iraq while allowing terrorist cells entry under the absurd rationalization that we are an open society and cannot discriminate against Muslims or Arabs, will indeed kill us. Until others can show that we are being attacked by ethnic groups different from those we have identified, this book is a must in opening the eyes of every American who wants to survive to see his and her children's smiles and grandchildren's eyes."
2,lacy15,Very difficult to read and follow events. The author is well versed and has factual material but not broken into pieces so it's manageable.
1,Asian Invasion,"Somewhere, there is a middle aged ultra-conservative white male author who's job has been outsourced to the Phillipines. Jokes aside, I'm of Asian descent and I would like to disassociate myself with anything Michelle Malkin has ever written. She is full-blooded Filipino, which makes her racially insensitive attacks on Hispanics, Muslims, and other minority groups that much more absurd. She is thoroughly confused about her identity, and she should have her head examined."
2,Xenophobia and Hypocracy = Michelle Malkin,"This sad diatribe confuses administrative errors and policy gaffs with the immigrant population these processes are meant to serve. By equating immigration as a disease (reminding Americans with even a cursory knowledge of history of the ""red menace"" phenomenon), Malkin is unable to escape the same sort of cyclical immigrant bashing that has been too common throughout the twentieth century."
5,Excellent Insight into Illegal Immigration in the USA,"The author, Malkin, did her homework. Illegal immigration is a huge problem in the U.S. with approximately 8 to 11 million illegal aliens in the country. Malkin repeatedly showed how politicians on both sides have sold out national security for the sake of votes and cheap labor. As a result, U.S. borders are still wide open after 9/11 and immigration laws go unenforced by law enforcement. Illegal aliens take full advantage of the U.S. taxpayer, free healthcare, welfare, schools for children, and they even fill our jails. As much as 25% of Los Angeles County jail inmates are illegal aliens and almost 30% of federal inmates are NOT U.S. citizens. Don't forget that terrorists have taken full advantage of our laxed immigration laws. Don't believe the poor 1 star reviews of this book if all the reader did was use the ""race"" card. The author herself is the daughter of immigrants. THIS IS THE BEST BOOK TO DATE THAT COVERS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION!"
1,Why does Malkin think Mexicans are terrorists?,"There is no evidence that of the 20-40 million Mexicans who have crossed the border over the past 2 decades that a SINGLE ONE has committed or abetted a terrorist act. Malkin should focus on her own Philippines, as a number of Filipinos have been deported from the US to the Philippines for having alleged ties to terrorists organizations. Malkin's hatred of Mexicans knows no bounds. She was recently part of the smear campaign against California Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante, identifying this mainstreamer as a Chicano militant hell-bent upon returning California to Mexico. The nutcases who rate this book highly better be careful about the type of Big Brother state they want; they are likely to get it some day, and they will be very, very sorry."
1,Most politically inept book of 2002...,"This is easily the most politically inept political book of the year. It's paper-thin and is nothing more than a place for Michelle Malkin to spit out her juvenile rants. How did this lady ever get a job writing? Is she even a journalist, or just a blowhard with connections? This book is weak from start to finish and does nothing to further the national debate."
3,"Good work, Michelle. Like you say - we should kick 'em out!","A robin whistles in a thicket. Down by the Cafe of the Two Bridges a decrepit goat gnaws on an old wooden steamshovel. Whispers emanate from the fog over the stream, ""Michelle, Michelle, passez mois le Ciling Labuyo"". And what a canard it was! Farmer Jeffers hosting his son-in-law, recently extradited from Luxembourg for enaging in the sale of contraband Gideon's Bibles! Yet that wasn't the cause. No... no.... it wasn't."
1,1 star was the lowest I could rate,"If you ignore everything I have to say, then just read the following line: READ THIS BOOK WITH SKEPTICISMMalkin writes like a self loather. If it weren't for her egocentric gains as the token Asian on Fox News, she would by writing the immigrant's story, or her families' story. It goes to show that with Malkin, it doesn't matter what side of the issue she believes, she'll take it on if she gets her 5 minutes and 50 bucks. Sounds like another profession we know doesn't it?"
3,mediocre kong,This was an okay tale of king kong kind of cheesy at times kids will love it adults will hate it.
5,I wouldn't be without this book!,"This is the neatest book. I'm allergic to most face cleansers and mosturizers so now I make my own with essential oils and carrier oils, and this is the book that showed me how. There are many blends to use. Very easy to understand instructions. Just all out a fine book!"
2,"Nice for beginners, but...","The recipes are okay if you're just starting out, but her creams tend to be high on oil and low on water. I find that the proportions in her cream recipes don't work very well for my skin (but they could very well work for yours. Everyone's different). For this reason, I didn't rate the book very highly. There is nothing here that you wouldn't find in other more comprehensive books (e.g. Earthly Bodies, Heavenly Hair by Dina Falconi). I was also mystified by Ms. Byers statement that facial steaming was bad for everyone (or something to that effect). It has certainly been wonderful for my skin, although obviously, it is not something I would do everyday. I've also read in Beauty magazines that many supermodels steam their faces regularly. For the amount of money I paid for this book, I felt I didn't get very much."
3,Pretty good,"This book is pretty good, but did not have as many recipes along the lines I was looking for. Also, the recipes did not have as many along the lines of organic and natural as I would have liked. But all in all, great start in making your own creations."
3,Great starter book.,"I have bought many books on natural cosmetics, so this fell short for me. I did buy it over the internet, so that can happen. If someone is just starting to dip into making their own cosmetics, this would a great book to start with."
5,Natural Body Basics: Making your own cosmetics,"I love all of Dorie Byers books, they are written in a way that everyone can understand. The retail price is good and the condition of the book when I received it was excellent."
4,I like the chocolate cover,"Overall, this is great retrospective book of Vik Muniz. Several comprehensive essays and interviews. I would have wished if his early works, chocolate works, and the dust series (whitney show) have been more presented as they are critical for Vik Muniz's career. However, amongst the several Muniz books, this is probably the best one (but could be better in the future)."
2,"Agreed, not durable","I've had this laptop cooler for about a year and half. I was originally using it on my XBox 360, but for the past year have been using it on an actual laptop. I stopped using it with the XBox because the outgoing usb ports died, now I've noticed that the left fan has just plain stopped and there are two broken fins on the right fan. This is through normal use."
2,not durable,"I rarely used this Vantec Lapcool2 since my purchase.Recently I intended to use it more often and one day I notice it gets more noisy and take a closer look.One fan doesn't work at all and the other one has missing blades.I have notebook on my lap and sitting on my bed most of the time while using it. I didn't put a lot of hours on it.Bottom line it's not well made.At that time I decide to find some durable well made cooling pads and set my eyes on a few full aluminum pads with 3 fans.Then I came across a sale on Antec's cooling pad.Though it's not full aluminum, I thought it's cheap with 3 year warranty and I would give it a try.I have to say Antec's (not Vantec's Lapcool2) cooling pad is well constructed with durable materials and the fans are quiet.So far I am very happy with Antec's (again not Vantec's Lapcool2) cooling pad."
3,Fine recital marred by lack of texts,"This disc was recorded in 2000, three years after Julia Varady (aka Mrs Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau) retired from the opera stage. Though one would not guess that the girlish ""Tatiana"" here was sixty. What makes this disc special is that while the soprano arias from Eugene Onegin can be found on many recitals, those from the Maid of Orléans, Mazeppa, The Sorceress, Pique Dame, and Iolanta are almost unknown (except to those with the complete sets). The problem is that since Orfeo have skimped on the texts and translations only those with the complete sets will have any idea what Tchaikovsky's heroines are singing about. What a wasted opportunity."
5,Best Texan Comedy Ever Written,"""Lone Star"" by James McLure is by far one of the best plays ever written.When reading or performing this play you can not help but to laugh. This play is about two brothers Roy and Ray who are out behind the local bar drinking. Ray trys to act cool and call Vietnam Nam' big mistake it leads Roy into a drunkin rage. Where he forces Ray into playing Vietnam with him, from there everything just gets crazy. By the end of the play Ray gets more and more stupid, Roy starts preaching but he is not making any sense, and they have both drank way too much.""I'm talking about the Bible boy I'm talking about the Garden of Eden"". Ray, not missing a beat replies ""you are?"". Lone Star is not only an outlandish crazy Texan Comedy it also contains every emotion known to man kind jealousy, hate for people who wear pocket protectors, love for inament objects(mainly a pink 1959 cadillac convertable), etc. James Mclure has truely written a masterpiece."
5,Must Have for Serious Tennis Players,"My dad would go on forever about Match Play and the Spin of the Ball. ""Have you read it yet?"" ""What chapter are you on?"" - touting it as a right of passage in terms of my tennis development. Wish I knew then what I know now. Without question, the best tennis book I have ever read. Still relevant decades later and like a breath of fresh air even now. Consumed this on my way to the West Coast for a national indoor title with my brother. I found myself laughing out load and rereading many sections, due in large part to the sheer genius of Bill Tilden. I have not taken a second spin thru the book in its entirety, but I believe every serious tennis player should have a copy somewhere close to the bedside table. Plan to give several out this Holiday to close friends, who will no doubt benefit from the sage wisdom Tilden imparts. Absolute ""must have""."
5,Left replacement mirror,Loved it. It bolted on perfectly and looks great. I have toldEveryone where to find good quality parts . I will definatly try toGet all my parts here now.
4,An undercurrent of dissatisfaction,"Hillary tries to make light of his torments and the losses of his friends. They knew war was inevitable but faced it with amazing fortitude. Beats all those gung ho American attitudes about why people go to war. Their response was sadness rather than anger.He tries not to preach but must have known this would be a testament to his friends. I was idly re-reading the first chapter this morning and wondering whatever happened to his friends who may have survived, only to find out that a biography of Hillary is being released in May this year."
4,A valuable book,"A remarkable personal narrative of a member of the ""Lost Generation"" finding some purpose for his life in war. It's tired and cliched now to talk about ""the just war"" or ""The Good War"" but this book gives flesh and bone to the whole idea. Hillary -- who would probably have become a notable write had he survived the war -- is an unusually articulate narrator, and he goes from youthful cynicism and selfishness to a profound understanding of the purpose of humanity as he loses friends and undergoes painful reconstructive surgery. At times, the book brings the Blitz, the Battle of Britain, and Britain in the late thirties and early forties to life in a way no restrospective history could hope to do.If you liked this book, then you can read about Hillary in Sebastian Faulks' ""The Fatal Englishman""."
4,Dont just a book by its cover,"Should be titled ""Richie Rich Presents J. Stalin Grabs, Snatches and Takes"" If you like J Stalin pick this one up and add to your collection. You will not be dissapointed. Other compilations have taken a few songs from this EP/LP, but this album being produced in 2004 means you would have heard it here first if you had it. J Stalin is part of the Replacement Killers on the features track listing."
2,Only if you want to put things smaller than 11x17 in it,This brief case was too small to hold my 11x17 paper items. Suitable for small documentation.
4,Great images for art!,"As a professional artist, I'm always looking for images that I can add to my collages and mixed media work. I have used these colorful pictures in my dollpins and artistamps, over and over again. If you are looking for vintage figures in color, you may prefer these to the reproductions of fashion books. They're fun and whimsical, and very adaptable."
3,Like the finish and colors..needs supervision,I like the soft edges and colors of the balls.The hammer is of wood so kids can hurt themselves if not supervised.As of now my 10 month old son just bangs the balls together.He has never used the hammer to push them through..He has sometimes used his hands to push them so the toy is not serving the exact purpose as yet.
4,Our son loves this but it isn't as durable as I thought.,We got this as a gift for our son last Christmas. He was only 6 months at the time but grew to love this toy. Even before we allowed him to use the hammer he was able to push the balls through. We prefer wooden toys over plastic because they usually prove to be more durable. The balls are heavy and the hammer could definitely do damage it could pose problem though we haven't had any. The green runners underneath the toy have unfortunately become loose though they haven't fallen off. We'll probably have to glue a bit before we use it with our next child.
2,Not sturdy enough!,"We have owned this toy for going on 2 years and I am not satisfied with the overall quality. The glue that plan toys uses does not work well at all...this is the second toy that we own from this company that has glue issues. The green track underneath the toy became loose probably a month after owning it from everyday use...nothing abusive just a 9 month old playing with it. The balls are very hard and can hurt a child if thrown, but I expected as much from a wooden and supervised my children accordingly. Recently one side of the green track came off completely. I am really dissatisfied with the quality- I expected that any wooden toys that I've purchased would be saved for my kids to give to their own kids someday. My son still bangs the hammer around alot but that alone isn't worth what I paid for this."
3,Too heavy!,"This toy is better in theory than practice in my opinion. The balls are too easy to push through -- one tiny tap of the hammer and it flies through. Additionally, the base is VERY HEAVY! My son dropped it on his toe and the whole thing turned black and purple and his toe nail fell off! And the hammer than comes with it is a fairly dangerous weapon in the hands of an excited toddler."
1,Balls fall through holes,These type of toys are great. But this one is terrible. The balls almost fall through the holes so no hammer is needed. My son just pushed them through with one finger. Choose a different hammer toy.
3,"Beautifully written, but...","In some ways, Vikram Seth's writing in ""An Equal Music"" is even more beautiful than in ""A Suitable Boy."" The backdrop of the world of music is compelling, and Seth has done his homework on string quartet repertoire and alternate tunings for violas. This is clearly an area that the author relishes. It's less certain how he feels about the love story. The aching of the lead character, Michael, over his lost love begins to strain credibility after awhile. In the end, this reader became annoyed with his wallow in self-pity.I do recommend this book for the sheer virtuosity of the writing. But read ""The Golden Gate"" and ""A Suitable Boy"" first."
4,A beautiful story,This author is such a pleasure to read. This book is touching and deep. You will find yourself thinking about the story and characters long after you've read the last page.
2,Love his work but he's over-reached himself this time.,"I place ""The Golden Gate"" and ""A Suitable Boy"" amongst my ten favourite novels but I was disappointed by ""An Equal Music"". Seth has over-reached himself. Being a music-lover (even such a passionate one as Seth) does not overcome the essential problem of conveying the effect of music in words. The reader simply becomes tired of all this gushing. Then there's the setting - Michael is supposed to be English but his London is a foreigner's London (he hangs around Hyde Park and Oxford Street) and he never uses even the most basic Londoner's slang. These aren't meant as factual quibbles: in a book which attempts to be realistic (as opposed to Rushdie's magic realism, for example) these things weaken an already boring character and fail to spark the reader's interest in him. NOW, a factual quibble: how the heck does a struggling musician pay the annual service charges of a portered flat (with lift) in Bayswater?"
2,Tedious for the non-musically inclined,"So much information on the music, distracted this musically uninformed reader from the slowly moving plot. However, the suspense built up, despite the rather nonsuspenseful story line. One good point, at least the ending was not predictable, nor was it too neatly wrapped up."
3,Disappointed,"The music part of this book was informative and kept me interested; but the love story seemed sophomoric. I kept wondering what Julia's problem was - what did she see in this guy? The resulting drama was just plain boring and I skipped through it. This was enough to ruin his love for music and for his violin? Good grief, grow up."
4,Julia's narrow escape,"I would agree with the other reviewer who says that the book was well written but not pleasant to read. The reason for this is that we are allowed to witness Michael lose his grip on reality as he is reunited with the only love of his life. He acted selfishly at that moment in life and lost her love. He again begins to act selfishly as he desires to resume his relationship with her even though that would involve hurting many, many other people in her life. Towards the end of the novel, I began to hope that Julia would be able to escape Michael. She doesn't know it but she narrowly avoided spending many wasted years on Michael rather than the wonderful, calm man that she did marry. It takes a very skilled and courageous novelist to allow us to see life from the perspective of someone so flawed and oblivious--for that reason as well as others, I really admire this particular novel by Vikram Seth."
4,"Good, but for other reasons.........","V. Seth has an incredible way of detailing the every day lives of people - keeps readers very interested. His novel is unparaleled in its portrayal of the lives of european-classical musicians. Book starts off great, however begins to drag in the middle. To a certain degree, we can all relate to Michael's situation with Julia but, the novel's flaw is that after awhile his endless infatuation become too pathetic, a bit unrealistic, and boring. The underlying story somewhat reminds me of Hardy's ""Jude."" Overall, I recommend Seth's novel first, for the special glimpse of classical musicians, their passion for music, and the wonderful imagery of classical music and second, for the overdrawn story of two former lovers."
3,Unequal Love Affairs,"To me the love affair in this book of a man with his violin felt more compelling than the love affair with his pianist. The novel portrays prima donas incapable of satifying relationships whose lives only seem worthwhile when they make music. The descriptions and dialogue of the characters in social situations seemed overwrought and tedious. The description of the quartet's warm-up scale, the auction of a coveted violin, the search for a stringed instrument that could manage special tuning -- these were the more affecting parts of the novel to me.I never got an understanding the title of the book. Can anyone help me out?"
2,Harlequin For Highbrows,"I was SO disappointed with this book. I was looking forward to reading it, especially as many reviews compared it to Rushdie's ""The Ground Beneath Her Feet"" (both stories centered around music and both authors from India I guess) but actually finishing this tedious book exhausted me. The interactions and struggles of the Maggiore Quartet, to which our narrator belongs, were mildly interesting but the rest of the book was weighed down with such hackneyed conventions that at times it became unintentionally funny. When Julia's big secret is revealed, when their tormented lives are discussed in toe-curling dialogue, you realize this is pure Barbara Cartland beach reading. If you want a shmaltzy romance then you will love it. If you want to read a good book that is based on the life of a struggling classical musician, read ""Grace Notes"" by Bernard MacLaverty."
2,He can do better!,"I rushed to order this book and was disappointed ! It does not come close to his ""magnum opus"" ""The Suitable Boy"". But to give him credit it is hard to follow up on a book like that. The language and style were his alright but the book lacked the feeling, depth and spontaneity of The Suitable Boy.I think he would do much better with the the setting & feel in a novel set in India .That was the charm and beauty of his earlier work . The characters just do not seem to come alive. I still look forward to his new works though!!!"
4,"Unusual, hard to put down, does not disappoint","I loved ""A suitable boy"" and was not disappointed in the least by Vikram Seth's new book. I could not put it down and was quickly drawn into the world of his characters, so vastly different from mine, but so immediately imaginable. Travelling through London, Venice and Vienna through his eyes, i can hardly wait until i see these places for myself."
1,PRETENTIOUS & BORING,"I was SO disappointed in this book. The characters were whiney and unrealistic, scenes were sloppy, characters not developed or stereotypical. Plus the whole story was just ludicrous - Michael never sufficiently explains why he left Julia nor does he sufficiently make up for it - it's just all about his selfish wants...ugh, I couldn't wait to finish this book...almost didn't. The only thing I really liked was the opening poem by John Donne"
3,Vikram Seth,"I had really high hopes from this book as i loved ""The Suitable Boy"" by Vikram Seth but i must say i was dissappointed,but anyone who wants to learn about music this is a good pick.....like all of his books this one is too well researched."
3,I loved `A Suitable Boy' but...,"`A Suitable Boy' is one of those rare books that make you feel as if you've somehow been reborn, or have shed a skin, opening up new panoramas and perspectives. Perhaps Vikram Seth was trying to do the same here though, at least in my case, failed. This would have made a great short story but for a full-length novel I found it surprisingly and disappointingly thin. Some brilliant writing, to be sure, but for me there was too much style and too little substance."
3,A minor exercise,"Vikram Seth on a bad day is better than almost anyone else on a good day -- but I admit I was disappointed in this book. After the almost hallucinatory lyrics of THE GOLDEN GATE, and the sweeping, hypnotic world of A SUITABLE BOY, I was prepared to be dazzled by AN EQUAL MUSIC.Despite the beautiful language, the book left me cold. I saw a review somewhere that described this book as ""BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY for intellectuals,"" and that's more or less how I saw it.Any Seth fan needs to buy this book anyway, to encourage him and give him as much financial support as he needs to get the next book done!"
5,A Musical Soiree,"Vikram Seth has done it again! His new novel is smooth as silk and goes down well, especially the parts about music-making. I think it's great when Indian writers write about subjects other than India and Indians and readers who like this book might also want to take a look at Joydeep Roy-Bhattacharya's extraordinary debut novel, The Gabriel Club, set in Budapest and Vienna, and available from Amazon UK (amazon.co.uk). ADITYA CHAUHAN"
1,Unfinished......,"The title, book cover and authors previous history suggested an interesting read however it fails on all parts and seems rushed/unfinished especially the final part. Vikram Seth never seems to grow the characters as the book proceeds and hence you are left with an overwelming feeling of ""is that it"" when it finally ends."
1,A Misfire,"As a former professional violist, I purchased this book with enormous enthusiasm, expecting an accurate and sympathetic depiction of the chamber music subculture. Instead, it consisted of a long-winded and uninspired account of a relationship between the second violinist and his lost-long lady-love, a married sex godess/pianist with major hearing deficits, an apparent composite of Demi Moore and Beethoven. For those readers interested in this subculture, I advise against reading this silly and distorted novel. Rather, spend your money on tickets to live performances of serious classical musicians."
2,Only Muzak.,"Having been recommended to read this by two acquaintances, one a music lecturer and the other a music PhD, it was a big disappointment. Basically, it's a potboiler dressed up with often badly misunderstood waffle about music and sold as serious literature. And it's also whiny, moody, depressing, cringeing, and lacks credibility. Jilly Cooper's music-based novels were almost more realistic - they were certainly 'livelier'!"
3,"engaging, especially if you enjoy music","This book was excellent (how could Mr. Seth write anything that wasn't?) but not quite up to the standard of Mr. Seth's ""A Suitable Boy."" He shows the same narrative grace and power here, but the central character is occasionally loathsome--an obsessive personality who sometimes makes his lover miserable. His lover also faces a problem that may compromise her career in music. If you can overlook the central character's behavior, the book is quite enjoyable."
2,disappointing music,"I think Seth has gone to a lot of trouble and detail in his depiction of the life of a musician, but i think he often got carried away with this aspect of the book at the expense of the story. I enjoyed both his wonderful style of writing and the story at first but it seemed to stagnate and become at times obscure and generally self-indulgent after the first 100 pages or so. i think it could have been a more powerful book if it was condensed and i found the characters, in particular Michael and Julia frustrating in that they were impenetrable and two-dimensional. This book could've been a lot better. Overall effect= depressing!"
2,Uneven in tempo...I wouldn't take a repeat on this one.,"I really tried to enjoy this book. As a musician (both cello & piano) I thought I would relate, but pfffffftt-- just couldn't get into it. One good sentence, at the beginning, which seemed auspicious, ""What I lost there (in Vienna) I have never come close to regaining,"" promised so much more than the the book actually delivered. I tuned-out half way thru and only finished it as one finishes playing a bad piece of music-- out of duty. And without enthusiasm."
5,A perfect read.,"I was overwhelmed by this book. Completely prepared to be disappointed, I am in awe of this work. Vikram Seth has managed to create a compelling and complete world in this book. The musical references are fascinating even to the musically ignorant (this reader) and the main character, Michael, is a carefully thought-out character. I sincerely believe that Vikram Seth is one of the most versatile and perhaps most verbally-nimble writer of our times and ""An Equal Music"" is perhaps his best work yet."
2,Not Music To My Ears,Not only did I want to drop the main character I wanted to pay for his anlysis. He was a pedantic cretin for most of the book...stalker and light weight sort of date that one would fish to pay for his bill and just get rid of him! Thank god she was deaf so she didn't have to hear his drivel. She made a great save in getting rid of this two bit violinist. He made himself so precious and introspective he became ultimately only interesting to himself. He is the reason that lip reading should be banned!
2,Disappointing,Is this novel written by Vikram Seth ? What happened to his simple - yet profound -style of writing prose ?
3,Enjoyed the classical music aspect,"I was initially attracted to this book because the main characters are classical musicians. Seth writes well about the passion that these professionals bring to their craft. I found myself wanting to hear the music they were playing ; my CD collection doesn't currently include much chamber music. [The audio book version does include snippets -- enough to whet your appetite for more.] I could not totally identify with either Julia or Michael, and wish that a bit more detail of their past in Vienna had been included. Nevertheless, I recommend this book."
3,Just don't compare it to A Suitable Boy,"As long as your not expecting another ""A Suitable Boy"" you will not be disappointed because it certainly isn't anything like the former. A more serious book (irony rather than straight humour) about love, missed opportunities, and fate (if you believe in it that is)... read it by all means but try to approach it without too many preconceptions and you;ll enjoy it more... I wish I had!"
5,Unequivocally Brilliant,"At one level, this is a book about the emotional and artistic travails of a failed musician. However, the protagonist's emotional turbulence comes across as a bit of a feeble and self-indulgent counterpoint to a latent but more powerful theme that the narrative explores - the agony of an accomplished musician who gradually loses her most treasured faculty - the sense of hearing.The book also successfully captures the author's self-proclaimed love for music. The numerous adulatory passages on sundry pieces of music might be tedious for some but strike a chord with anyone who is passionate about music. Seth's portraiture of the classical music scene in London is as evocative as Victor Hugo's homage to Parisian Architecture in the Hunchback of Notre Dame.One helluva Musical!!"
4,Subtle and sublime,"I recall that several years ago, I started Seth's ""Golden Gate"" and never finished it. Thus it was with some hesitation that I began ""An Equal Music"". I am so grateful that I did. I read the book over two days, and was struck by two things above all -- the dramatic tension that Seth manages to sustain, and the precision in the description of his characters. To use an obvious musical analogy, there isn't a dischordant note in the book. Seth knows how to be sympathetic at a distance -- one empathizes with the protagonist's pain at the same time that one senses Seth revealing to us the character's narcissism and romantic selfishness. I was captivated throughout, and as one who knows very little about classical music, was not in the least bit bored or distracted by the many complex musical references in the book. Hugely entertaining with a beautiful, emotionally wrenching conclusion."
5,High Praise,"The woman across the aisle on the train from London to Penzance breezed through half the book during a five hour train ride; I figured it must be engaging. It is an engaging, suspenseful, wistful novel. Upon my arrival at home, in San Francisco, I could not wait to share the book with friends."
3,A good read!,"I quite like the way he described the rehersals and the style he played. I myself though played the violin and belonged in an amateur music group, I never quite thought of music-making in a way as Seth puts it. I think the way he writes is quite poetic. The only problem with this book is that the story is a little slow-paced."
3,music in making,"In spite of the totally different setting, An Equal Music shares with A Suitable Boy the theme of disruptive passion which must be overcome stoically. Somewhat shabby in the description of situation and characters, An Equal Music is nevertheless a captivating tale of adultery in the unusual setting of ""music in making""."
1,The John Donne quote is the only good thing about the book!!,"A tepid love story. Naive writing, absurdly simplistic at times. I cringed at some of the sentences. A third-tier writer faking it. My only question-how did this get past editors??"
1,Equal to Boredom,"Classical music, romance--sounded divine. With the premise of the novel, I thought surely it would be placed on my list of great literary loves, hence I bought the hardcover. Not so. Not even close. In 30 years of reading, this is the first book I've not been able to complete. The writing is so tedious, it's almost painful to consume one page. Attempts to discipline myself & meander through to its entirety were unsuccessful. Suffered through 1/3 & decided to re-read Romeo & Juliet to ease my agony. The story went nowhere & very, oh so very slowly! On the plus side, the cover of the book is visually pleasing so it remains on my bookshelf."
5,An excellent summary,"I've taken Professor Dobbyn's insurance class, and let me tell you that everything he said there has been boiled down to very clear and concise points in this book. It's the only book on insurance you would ever need - a must for any student taking insurance law. From basic concepts of insurance to specific rules, this book covers everything."
1,Bad effort...,"I like the song ""Small town Saturday Night"" which is Hal's only real hit and it was 9 years ago. I am always disappointed with new stuff."
5,Hal Ketchum touches the heart again,"I saw Hal Ketchum sing in 1996. He had just written ""Days of Wonder"" and ""Turn of the Wheel"", which he performed. They are still as soul baring and truthful as they were 3 years ago. Hal allows his soul to shine through in his writing and in his voice as always. This is an excellent album, with a wide range of emotions, all done in Hal style."
5,THE GREATEST SELECTION OF BRUBECK TUNES!!!!!!!!!!,"If you haven't herd any Brubeck music, this is the album you must get first, besides Time Out. This album has the greatest assortment of Brubeck tunes I ever herd in the best order.You'll love this music, and the album itself."
3,Dave Brubeck - Greatest hits,These are not his best songs but they are still good. I thought that the Brubeck Love Songs album had a better choice of material.

4,great toy,"its a great toy, very cute and my daughter loves it. finally received it after waiting over a month to deliver to australia. kiddie collection were great with their communication so i wouldn't fault them at all. HOWEVER the shipping costs are WAAAAY too high and not justifiable for the size and weight of the item."
4,Intense Line Defense review,Really good product. Started seeing results within a couple of weeks. Fine lines have actually been reduced! Have also noticed smoother skin. Would definitely recommend it.
3,"Cute Goldie Hawn comedy,","but, lets face it she been cute for years, still is. Spoiled, rich, princess, marries, hubby dies on their wedding nite. She's depressed and dispondent, so when better to make a life altering decision? She joins the army, and the comedy begins. Nothing eye opening, just a cute comedy starring cute Goldie. Enjoy!"
5,Private Benjamin,"One of Goldie Hawn's great movie...What happens to this ""Prima Donna is a bellyful of laughs.This is how you can change for the better..."
4,Fun trip down Memory Lane,"This is a fun edition of the ""Goldie"" oldie. The DVD of ""Private Benjamin"" features the excellent quality of the original film. I did miss the original VHS jacket information,Delivery was prompt. I remember some scenes from the Denver premere that were not included in this edition and enjoyed the newer version for a better storyline. There is an amazing number of cameo,s to catch in the details. (PUNs intended)."
5,Great Movie,I've only seen bits and pieces of this movie on tv a few times. I've never seen the whole movie till I bought it from Amazon. I really enjoyed this movie. But it did seem pretty long. Or maybe it seemed long because I had to keep stopping it or starting it over. Well I enjoyed it anyways.
1,Private Boring!,"Goldie Hawn is hilarious but this is the most boring movie that I have seen her in. I disliked it like 15 minutes in but kept watching it, thinking it has to get better, it just didn't. I swear at parts that it was the ending but than it kept going...and going....and going and it wasn't nothing to keep going on about! This wasn't a comedy, but a tragedy!"
5,Goldie Hawn shines in Private Benjamin,"Goldie Hawn shines in her first producing and starring role of Private Benjamin. The hilariously funny and witty comedy proves just how versatile this stunning actress can be. When Goldie meets her nemesis the tyrannical Captain Lewis who calls Goldie Princess the fun is just beginning. From the time Goldie cleans the bathroom with her electric toothbrush, to whining her way out of jumping out of an airplane this is definitely one of Goldie's finest moments. If you are Goldie Hawn fan and haven't seen this movie, you've been missing out."
3,Pvt Benjamin Revisited,"After my daughter enlisted in the Navy, I purchased this movie because I wanted her to see it. I had forgotten alot of it, but still enjoyed it. Watching it thru the eyes of a mother/wife, as opposed to when I first saw it as a teenager, one sees a completely different message in it."
2,Half-comedy,"Did anyone but me notice that this movie stops being a comedy the moment Judy Benjamin defies her parents and decides to remain in the army? From the very next scene through the conclusion, it becomes a deliberate feminist polemic and deliberately unfunny. Feminism is nice, but filmmakers seem either afraid to have too much fun with it or unable to keep from aiming over the top. (See Nine to Five and The Incredible Shrinking Woman for two other examples.) Eileen Brennan's scene in which she first meets Benjamin is the high point and (unfortunately and needless to say) comes early. As with Swing Shift, Hawn flexed her star muscles and did things her way -- to the detriment of the product and the audience."
1,not widescreen,It's a damn shame when Widescreen filmed movies are released full screen only. That is a disgrace to the whole movie. private Benjamin is a great movie but I erefuse to but the dvd if they are only going to relase a full screen edition. I Sofa King hate that
4,Entertaining Read for Young and Old,"It's humorous with beautiful illustrations. It has the added advantage of historical settings, a painless way to increase cultural knowledge. Follows the travels of a crocodile snatched from the Nile to the French Court. Not quite for preschoolers, more for K-2;."
3,presentation,"STRICTLY FOR CASH, 1951""Strictly for cash"" is the story of how Johnny Farrar made his roll of money. He started out to make five thousand and ended up with a quarter of million. But he didn't get it by legitimate means. And as a result, he found himself in big trouble. From the moment the reins of the richest casino on the Florida coast fell into his hands, he was sucked into a whirlpool of suspense, intrigue, murder and ruthless ambush from which he was unable to tear himself free.See more at http://jameshadleychase.free.fr"
3,Need the Driver CD even for XP,"Easy to use (although it's not intuitive because the card goes in upside down). However a big negative point is that it doesn't use standard USB Mass Media storage drivers, so you have to carry around the CD with the driver on it."
1,XP users stay away!,"If you are an XP user, I strongly advise that you not buy this product. I did, despite the trouble another reviewer experienced. My system had a serious failure twice: once using the CD software they supplied and that was said to be XP compatible and the second time after downloading the driver explictly for XP. Why spend money for something that can screw up your computer? I am returning my device immediately. SimpleTech ought to be ashamed of its false advertising and its very, very buggy software."
1,Not XP Pro Compatible,"This reader has serious problems with Windows XP Pro. I installed the reader on 2 computers and had problems on both. First of all, the reader should map without installing the drivers from the CD. However, neither computer automatically mapped the device. Then after installing the driver from the CD, both computers crashed multiple times."
4,Great information in an engaging style,This book truly will help my grandchildren identify scat and tracks. I would give this book a full five stars except it begins with a little boy who is frightened of grizzly bears. My 6-year-old granddaughter doesn't need any suggestion of being afraid of grizzlies. Her older brothers (ages 12 and 13) will adore the in-depth discussion of poop! We'll need to set aside several hours for tracking while we're at Yellowstone.
5,Great presentation.,A great DVD for impressionist lovers. Manet is shown as the wonderful artist he was.
4,the side you never see,"I purchased this documentary primarily to learn more about the cluster bombing of Lebanon that I'd heard was devastating to the civilians living there. That segment was fascinating. They pick up the bombs by hand, the method is so low tech, it's very frightening. The rest of the story is also very good, you really see what's happened on the ground to everyday innocent people in the cities and out in the sticks. One part, where a father comes up and in front of the camera and ""teaches"" her small daughter that Isreal destroyed all her toys, cuts right to the core of what keeps the Middle East the violent and intractable place it's been for so long. Highly recommended."
2,"Impractical, Dated, and Academic","Impractical because the implementation approach recommended is abstract and generic: phases include ""exploration"" and ""involvement.""Published in 2002, the book shows its age in its discussions of e-commerce and e-loyalty.Academic because the book has substantial sections on debates with no practical value including ""payoff paradox"" and ""technology curves.""Finally, the print quality is poor. The chapter heading pages resemble photocopies.For a tighter, more modern approach you might want to look at one or both of:The Business Case Checklist: Everything You Need to Review a Business Case, Avoid Failed Projects, and Turn Technology into ROIMaking the Software Business Case: Improvement by the Numbers"
3,An okay read,I thought the book was an okay read but not something that I would have many take-aways from....If you are an IT professional it might be worth your effort to get a copy and read it....
2,Okaaay...,"For Toguro and Yusuke fans (Kuwabara fans also) you should like this. ""SPIRIT FLYSWATTER!"" pwns all. Anyway, there's a lot of suspense and talking. I didn't enjoy it all that much, but I DO want to know how Yusuke vs. Toguro will be resolved. I'd say buy it used..."
5,Final Fight Begins!,"Like all of my Yu Yu Hakusho review so far, I saw this one on a crappy subtitled version which took all of the fight and condensed it into 5 minutes. I didn't see much of the Kuwabara/Elder Toguro fight but I can mention this: Kuwabara learns of Genkai's death from Elder Toguro and becomes enraged. In his blind and stupid fury, he tries to slice his enemy to bits. Throughout the entire fight, I'm guessing Elder Toguro is sliced up and put together around 2 or 3 times. Eventually, and in a way I wasn't explained in my junky version, Kuwabara defeats Elder Toguro, leaving Yusuke and Younger (yet much more evil) Toguro for the final round of the Dark Tournament!Togoro FINALLY goes to 100% of his power and Yusuke releases his energy in what I think looks like a phoenix. Anyway, I'll continue this review of the Torugo/Yusuke fight in the next volume of Yu Yu Hakusho: End of the Dark Tournament (Uncut)!"
3,Hilary is the reason i watched it,"this film is empty, and by empty i mean there is nothing to expect, nothing to wait for while watching it. i only bought it because of Hilary duff."
3,Fairly good book,"""Take Your Characters"" is the text used by University of Wisconsin-Madison Continuing Studies for its online course of the same name. It covers all the fundamentals of writing fiction in short stories and novels: plot, setting, dialogue, conflict, POV, etc. However, the author covers too much in too few pages; therefore, she gives superficial treatment to each topic. Each chapter starts with a scene of Georgina, a fictional writer, interacting with Henry Petry, her novel's protagonist, which, to me, serves little purpose. The chapters end with checklists of important points and writing exercises, and at the end of the book is a glossary of terms commonly used in fiction. Chapter 11 is the weakest in the book. There are long extracts and verbose commentaries that are likely to stump beginning writers. Overall, this is a fairly useful book for newbies."
4,A Helpful Manual For Writers,"This is one of the better writing ""manuals"" I have read. Yourke gets right to the point, and she covers all aspects of writing fiction. Examples abound in the chapters, which end with applicable writing exercises."
5,Welcome Comfort,This is one of my most favorite Christmas books - one I read and reread every Christmas and often give as a Christmas gift. A most touching holiday tale - kudos to Patricia Polacco on her wonderful stories!
4,"Not his best, but still very, very good!","Yeah, ok, the drummer is way off, his timing sucks and he looks alternatively sick, angry or distracted. Maybe he was sick that day. But we have to remember that it is a live performance with all the screw-ups that come with it. Betts is still a master guitarist and band leader.My only question is why is the sound on the CD so much fuller and better than on the DVD? They were recorded at the same show! I have to also highly recommend the 3 cd Instant Live set, recorded with this same band."
1,Have a Big Dud,"Much as I anticipated the performance at this venue by a guitarist I have chased around for years, I have to agree with others who think this video is dreadful. I rarely feel ripped off when I purchase (and I did not buy this through Amazon, I might add) but this one is so bad that I feel compelled to warn others. I am scratching my head over the positive reviews that have posted for this DVD. Run away fast!"
2,disappointing,"Got this recently - loved Eat a Peach and Brothers and Sisters...so this offering was disappointing. Some good playing, but some problems as well. I agree with others about the drummer - some real glitches there! Great bass player - keyboards good but a little rough here and there. Dickey still playing some great lines, not many guitarists are instantly recognizable for having a unique sound, and he is one! But overall, hmmm......"
3,OUTDOOR RESEARCH POUCH,"NOT AS GOOD AS MY OLD ONE, BUT I CAN LIVE WITH IT. OLD ONE HAD A MUCH BETTER SET UP ."
5,Gioacchino,AS REAL AS IT GET'S. NOTHING WILL BRING YOU CLOSER TO THE WAY THINGS WERE AND THE TROUBLES WITH DEALING WITH TODAY'S NEW WORLD AND ETHICS. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY PIZZAN.
2,tempered enthusiasm,"I am not as enamored with this book as the other reviewers. Even though the authors tried to simplify statistics, I still found the concepts confusing. The much-praised ""humor"" I felt was corny and occasionally annoying. I read this book along with a standard statistics textbook, and I didn't feel that it helped to clarify things too much. Perhaps there are no shortcuts to learning statistics."
1,just get to the point!,"I found this book extremely annoying to read. I thought itwould be a good idea to get an easy statistics book that doesnot presume too much prior knowledge I quickly found the socalled ""humor"" to seriously interfere with readability. Theconstant attempt to be funny simply becomes the book's majorgoal in almost every sentence you read! and I just found this irritating to a degree that the book is rendered useless."
5,An update from the author,"Searching For Home continues to be sold to interested parties. However, finding those interested parties continues to be a challenge. The process of marketing a book and letting people know about its existence is no easy task. I believe this book is reaching people who it is supposed to. My publisher is well intentioned and a very dear man. However, with a small publishing and marketing budget, consumer awareness is low. Yet, the consumers who know about this book send rave reviews. I suppose every author's dream (and publisher's dream, too!) is to have a best selling book. My dream was to write down my personal story and share it with others. I've done that, and hope by sharing my story, others will be inspired to share their story too. Sending Blessings. Laurelynn Martin, author"
4,Searching for Home,"Laurelynn Martin's book beautifully documents and illustrates her personal journey through life, and her amazing recovery from a near fatal series of events. During this time she encounters a Near Death Experience. The vision she shares of her NDE can help comfort many people who lack support and understanding. Her intention to find meaning through her illness promotes an incredible spiritual connection. She receives and shares many guided messages that are very uplifting and inspiring as she seeks to heal her phyical body. The subject matter in her book can enlighten and warm the hearts of those who read it as she miracuously regenerates her health and creates a loving family."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoy books on near death experiences. I love the descriptions of what is on the other side, and the sense of life purpose that unfolds. This book, Searching for Home, does contain Laurelynn Martin's NDE description, but the rest is a diary of a journey to many healers - the modern medical model and the supernatural and everything in between. If I were searching for a book about faith healers, their successes and failures, this could be it. However, we don't even get a good description of these processes, just a written account of what she has tried. As far as the NDE category, this book just doesn't belong. The messages from her guides are also generalized new-age messages that can be found in any self-help book or even quotes on calendars we look to for inspiration. I wish I hadn't spent the money on this book."
5,Great Book,"You won't be disappointed, from air/fuel/spark to control systems, this is a very well written and informative book."
1,Don't waste your money,"This adapter has driver problems. I downloaded all the recommended software. It still does not work right. I went to the Dlink support site, no help.It will not let my computer shut down correctly in hibernation or standby mode. In hibernation, it just keeps running the computer and will not shut down. In standby, when I bring it back up it says I ejected the hardware incorrectly.Please, please don't waste your money. Buy something that works. I have used Netgear with great success, never has these kind of problems. I wish I stuck with them."
4,Work on a Cross Platform Wireless,"So far its working great on My Apple Extreme Network, I have my other XP machine which works great with DLINK. Dlink accorindg to many blogs online show the best results to work with Apple Airport Extreme. Good BuyP.S Folks i just wanted to clarify that i did not use this product on a Mac Book or an older G3 or G4. I was able to connect all my PC's to an AppleAirport netwrok."
2,Really not worth it,"Worked fine for 86 days. Then it died. While I don't expect these devices to last forever, 86 days seems a little bit too short. While the price is good, it probably is not really worth it."
1,it's a 4-star product,"OK. I take my words back. I found a solution to the connection problem with windows xp. Download a patch ( WindowsXP-KB884020-x86-enu.exe, solving WPA issues) from microsoft, then everything goes as it should be.-------------------------------------i bought this USB adapter along with DI-624 router for $99. The router works perfectly fine. The USB adapter gave me so much trouble. i used it to connect my desktop pc to wireless network. It works when the network is not encrpted. But it won't find an IP address under WPA security. It searches IP address endlessly. I have winxp sp2 which is supposed to support wireless flawlessly. I think either this so-called 108m bps or the driver causing the trouble. Having seen others having problem with other brands of USB adapter, i think maybe for desktop, a wireless pci card is better."
2,Beware Centrino Owners,"I bought this to connect my notebook to my DI-624 at 108Mbps.It worked well enough and I didn't have any of the driver installation issues other reviewers have mentioned.However the D-Link drivers interfere with the Intel wireless drivers on Centrino notebooks - my internal wireless card stopped working and after I got D-Link customer support to acknowledge there was a problem, the only solution they could offer was to re-install Windows. Thanks guys.Also, I've recently upgraded to a DI-634 router and I can no longer connect at 108Mbps if I have any kind of encryption turned on. This is probably a propblem with the router, but its worth knowing."
3,"Yes, and no","Neither the D-Link website nor Amazon mention that this is not Vista compatible (or at leat they didn't when I bought it); I found out when I called the D-Link help line. Since I had bought this to create a network with a new computer, that poses a bit of a problem. However, the product does work well with an XP computer, although it occasionally disappears from the desktop and the software doesn't open; later, it mysteriously reappears. This, of course, could be the computer or the Netgear router, not the adapter. Consistently has a 108 Mbps signal."
4,Quick setup,"Quick setup and works well for its use. I have a feeling its a little ""weaker"" signal pick-up than say a regular PCI add-in card but its mobile, easy to install and easy to use."
2,"When it works, works well enough","Like some others, I've run into strange performance issues with this device, and it's the first DLINK product that I've been less than thrilled with.The largest problem is that the device loses connection when I'm burning CDs. And when the wireless device is offline, nothing short of a full reboot will restore operation. Unfortunately, sometimes it corrupts files on my C: drive, and XP will read the device as being bad hardware, and goes into a death spiral of checking the C: drive, failing, rebooting, trying to check the C: drive. Only thing you can do at that point is unplug the Wireless Adapter and start over. It's frustrating and I've given up on using the device. I'll throw it in a drawer to use when I'm working on someone else's PC at home."
1,Not even connect to DI-624.,I bought this to connect my desktop computer to my DI-624 at 108Mbps.I installed properly and device is working properly.Network signal is very strong. The network is not encrpted. It is fully open.BUT DWL-G132 does not connect to the DI-624 router. No error message..
2,Despite being pretty...,"These are pretty and comfortable earrings, but there is one major problem I have with them: the backings are extremely difficult to get off of the actual earrings! My other pair of Studex piercing studs are much easier to separate the backings from the earring, but this pair is damn near impossible to do so..."
4,Nice mellow country-rock,"Mellow country rock, with more than a slight nod towards ""Running On Empty"" era Jackson Browne... I was initially resistant to this album, but it grew on me. There are plenty of catchy tunes, full of chiming, melodic guitars and laid-back vocals... The delivery may be a little too languid, but this is certainly worth checking out if you want something listenable and catchy. One wonders, though, if there will be any WTC-related backlash to the song, ""Cropduster,"" one of the album's highlights, along with the David Lindley-ish ""Rae-Ann"". Worth checking out!"
4,David Done It,While the movie is dated it is also an old movie. The disk arrived promptly and in Good condition. I have nothing bad to say about the movie or the service.
3,Baby Boom,"When woman were just starting to try to have it all. Diane Keaton has a great job that she loves and suddenly inherits a baby. Chaos, change, female strength, love endure. Chick flick definitely."
3,BABY BOOM DVD,"I am very happy for your services, however this product arrived with the disc loose inside..I have not opened the movie yet but you can tell the disc is dancing all over the box inside so that means the disc must be all scratched and maybe useless.. I requested a return label but I still am waiting for it so I can send it back and receive a different one.."
5,A wonderful movie that teaches you what is important in life,This movie shows you how important and influential a baby can be in someones life. Baby Boom has a great variety of comical jokes along with heartwarming moments that you will remember forever. This is a must have for any woman's video collection! Buy it!
5,baby boom,diane keaton is great in baby boom . she makes motherhood look easy and juggle work at the same time...when she left with a baby from her cousin's will she finds herself in between motherhood/work.... it a movie you got to see ....
5,Baby Boom,"Very delightful and funny. I love the scenes between Diane Keaton and Sam Shepherd, especially when she tells him her problems, then realizing he is a vet. That scene is priceless."
4,"It is what it is, but it's good","This is another one of those movies for which I have a strange affection. When it pops up on cable, I usually have to watch at least some of it. It is perfect at summarizing the 80s, yuppie mentality and Diane Keaton is probably the cutest in this film since Annie Hall. It's funny. schmaltzy, romantic and pretty. All the cast is really good here and it's quite nicely filmed. There are certainly a lot worse ways to spend your time."
5,Still one of the best movies,"Great movie, watched it several times long ago, but had to finally own it. Just a feel good movie. I love this one."
2,It does not contain the Spanish audio track,"I ask for this item because the description says that contains the spanish audio. And it is not true. I claimed for that. They send me another one (that I didn't ask for) and I didn't send back the other one (because it was a gift for my friend, and my friend went out of the country next day). I had to pay for two DVD's because I tried to cancel the order, but they said to me that they can't cancel the order. I stop buying DVD's to avoid this."
1,This boom is a total bust,"Diane Keaton is a successful management consultant in NYC who ""inherits"" a baby from recently deceased relatives. She doesn't want it, doesn't know what to do with it--but can't give it up either. So she takes it, quits her job, and moves to a farm in Vermont. She begins making baby food which sells like hotcakes, and meets Sam Shepard, a local vetinarian and down-to-earth guy. Given a chance to return to NYC with her baby food, she decides to stay on the farm. Totally unbelievable from the git-go, and Keaton is at her obnoxious worst."
5,An old standby,This is a movie that is always enjoyed every time i watch it. I need to purchase this movie because i never get tired of it.It is very cute.
5,A Winner,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's full of Keaton's self discovery. She discovers who she really is, and it's not who she thought. A beautiful, sometimes sick, sometimes dirty, and always needy baby enters her life and changes everything!Love the ending! Makes me want to start a business. ;o)"
1,does not play,did not know this would not play on my DVD player when I ordered it. this was not clear in the information about the format!
3,It is what it is. And that's good.,"It's good konbu. For someone that doesn't have easier or cheaper access to good konbu, it's a good purchase."
5,Greyhound loves them!,"I tried these when I found them on clearance at a local pet store. They were an instant hit with my Greyhound. He has a sensitive stomach sometimes, but these didn't bother him at all. He chomps them down in minutes. They are good quality but they come with a price.They have little odor and leave no mess on the floor. Not greasy, not hairy, or too hard. They can fairly easily be broken in half to make two treats out of one tail. My only regret is I didn't buy more. One reviewer noted a choking/swallowing problem, but my dog has had absolutely no problems with them."
4,BOTH my senior blind cocker and golden retriever puppy LOVE them!,"I have a blind 9 year old Cocker Spaniel who is very VERY food-responsive and she just loves them! She can demolish one in 45 minutes or less. My newest addition, a 10 week Golden Retriever puppy, isn't as food-responsive but still loves them! Initially, I purchased them for my puppy since she is teething. I was really looking for a product that would keep her attention (something that smells and tastes good to her) and soothe her teething needs. I honestly decided on ""bully sticks"" after reading great things about them from the Dog Whisperer Cesar Millan's book. They are great b/c they don't smell bad (only a slight odor) but both my dogs love them. My only complaint is the price. If my dogs didn't chew them so fast, the price wouldn't be an issue. I love the product and I will continue to purchase. I am hoping I do not have any digestive issues like others have had. So far - so GREAT!"
5,Corgi goes INSANE over them!,"I have a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and let me tell you she goes absolutely BALLISTIC if we mention the word ""toothpick"" around her. She LOVES THESE. Your doggie will too! Highly recommended for pooches everywhere."
1,Dangerouse treat,"Merrick's Texas Toothpicks Value Pack (6.5 oz bag)From the first look the cow tails are very dry and stiff, look old and are dark in color. Besides those, when my dog started chewing on it, we saw that she is spitting out these bone fragments that she can not chew on. After examining the treat, I saw that the middle part of the cow tail is just like a bone. This is a very dangerous treat for specially small dogs like Multi-poos. I usually buy cow tails from my local pet shop and have never had such problem. The middle part is spongy and easy to chew. I do not recommend this product!!"
1,"Cool Idea But ""My"" Dogs Won't Tough It","I have (7) small to medium size dogs and I buy them a variety of treats monthly here on Amazon. I like getting them things they can chew on and that is good for their teeth so I thought these Texas Toothpicks would be perfect! Maybe these are only for larger dogs because my small/medium size dogs want nothing to do with them and they do love to chew on bones and treats but not these sticks! So this was unfortunately a waste of money for me and my furry ""kids"" and I thought other pet owners might have the same reaction as my dogs did. I will take them to the animal shelter because maybe there are those ""bigger"" dogs that might appreciate these sticks and they will not go to waste at least!"
5,natural teeth cleaner,"Good treats for our little dog. I cut them in half with a saw because they are to big for a little dog.Otherwise,he loves them."
4,My Yorkies LOVE Texas Toothpicks,"My Yorkies LOVE Texas Toothpicks. It is one thing that keeps them occupied for a while. The ones in my bags were darker than usual -- but I guess they were OK, because my dogs still ate them."
5,Love it,Our dogs love the toothpicks. Nick parks himself in front of the cabinet in the morning just waiting for his treat. Anna chews not only his but steals Nicks. They last all day with our guys.
4,Schnauzer's favorite treat.,The quality of this product is outstanding. I cannot get my dog to even consider any othe treats. I only wish that they were not so expensive.
5,From your digital camera to your computer fast!,"I have a Kodak Easyshare DX3700, which uses multimedia cards. I really like the camera, but didn't like the slow transfer times to move images from the camera to my computer. The Simpletech Flashlink provided the perfect solution and now I can get images on my PC to Photoshop super fast!"
2,same old same old,"This book has the same old information you have already heard. I really did not like this book. It had several items that are false in it, like gorillas eat meat, which they do not. It has lots of negative information on various foods but offers no suggestions on where to buy an alternative product. I just do not see the point of adding this book to your library or collection. No new information whatsoever."
3,some bad info,"I'm disappointed that there are ingredients suggeted for some recipes that are potentially harmful, Suggesting that corn oil or canola oil should be used without saying it MUST be organic is irresponsible."
5,I have used this reference for nearly 20 years,"Ever wonder how to cook quinoa or make your own hummus? Or what bovine hormone is (found in some milk)and why you should avoid it? Or that Burgamot oil is what gives Earl Grey Tea its ditinctive aroma? For those who would like to know this ""bible"" is for you! It will not only show you how to prepare dried garbanzo beans but you will also be able to turn it into a tasty hummus. Maybe you'd like to try an unusual vegetable like Arugala, Jicama or Belgian Endive; bake with natural sweeteners such as honey, malt syrup, or date sugar; need an explanation of what spice to use in what dish; or cook an obscure dried grain. It's chock full of tidbits about the minutia of cooking that I wasn't able to find in any other source. Nineteen years ago, I bought it out of curiosity and to cook the mundane grain, barley and I haven't looked back since. I highly reccommend this book for those who consider the kitchen your 'tool shed'."
1,Book not received,"Cannot review on this book, as I have not received it as yet. Although I am desparately wanting to receive it and see what it containsThanksAmanda"
5,God Knows His Name,"This is an incredible story of a deaf man who was found wandering the streets of Jacksonville, IL and subsequently institutionalized at Lincoln State School and Colony. It is an easy-to-read account that tells about all of the horrors and abuses that John Doe No. 24 endured and the way he survived it all. When he also went blind, he was almost totally disconnected from he world. Yet, somehow, he maintained a sense of humor and enjoyed the simple things of life.Anyone interested in the beginning of what is now called ""Special Education"" should read this book. Highly recommended."
5,Exquisite Book,"Mr. Bakke has written a riveting book about a nearly unbelievable life. The reader is rapt by the circumstances 'Mr. Doe' meets at every turn, and Mr. Bakke has penned his words in a way that allows the reader to feel something of the feelings Mr. Doe must have experienced. The story told by the book is at once heartrending and hopeful; Mr. Doe is 'trapped' in 'the system,' but he is often shown mercy by compassionate people who even now deserve to be honored for their efforts.One question remained when I had finished the book: Why did no one---the police, a social worker, ANYBODY---allow Mr. Doe to take them back down the trail he had traveled? Let him be a passenger in a car, pointing his way back to his place of origin?Great book, though. I'd recommend it for almost anyone of any age. THANK YOU, MR. BAKKE, for showing us the twists and turns of this lost human riddle."
1,Very bad case,"The case didn't hold. The two parts making the case were separated after just 3 weeks of use.Tried to glue it but to no avail. It's a shame, seemed like a great product at first."
4,Better than expected,I love that the back has a matte texture to it and it is clear too. I love the Anti- Slip grip cuts down on the dirt for my HTC is white. Also very durable it's gonna protect the phone. Smart purchase.
1,Does not last.,"The high reviews are from people who havn't used this product for very long. The seam between the two types of plastic started peeling apart very early on, and are now almost halfway gone. Also, the cutout holes are off, very much so around the camera. While it's still usable, it is unattractive and lets in dirt and dust very easily. I doubt mine will be in one piece for much longer. Would not buy from this company again."
5,"out of ALL of my 600 cd's, this is in the top 3!!!","this is the only cd i have ever replaced after something happened to the first one! i keep a burned copy of this cd hidden away now for just-in-case purposes...this reaches down into whatever soul i have left and rescusitates me... rejuvenates... uplifts my dead body from the cold ground and re-animates me/giving me life and reason to live... yall aint gotta be touched like that ...but if you even THINK you do, even a lil' bit... then if this cant do it, nothing else ever will... fareal..."
5,The O'Jays at their romantic best.,"This 10-track compilation is limited to romantic ballads culled from The O'Jays' first three Philadelphia International albums. While most of these songs never got released as singles, they nonetheless remain firm favorites of the group's many fans. Ironically enough, most of The O'Jays' biggest 1970s hits were uptempo dance tracks (""Back Stabbers"", ""Survival"", ""Message In Our Music"", ""Love Train"", ""Put Your Hands Together"", ""992 Arguments"", etc.) yet the group has always been (rightly) regarded as one of the Soul ballad's most important exponents. Enjoy!"
1,I must be an alien from an unknown galaxy.,"I am totally out of synch with the readers of this planet. After reading 10 pages (or less), I had to force myself to finish this book. My thoughts were that there has got to be SOMETHING redeeming in this story, so I labored to the end hoping to find a clue. As I thankfully closed the cover on that one, I asked myself, ""How in the world did this ever get published??"" Then I realized, Judy Blume is a well-known author of literature for adolescents and this is exactly the type of book a young girl would relate to, except for that power-thing which seemed to be thrown in for pure titilation. My recommendation, spend the money on a different paperback...or on a lottery ticket."
2,disapointing . . .,"This book seems very two dimensional, compared to her works for young adults. Her characters are rather flat, and difficult to get involved with. It is entertaining enough, but the denouement is visible from miles away."
5,"Absolutely fabulous, definently a book to pass on!!!",In this book Judy makes you think of your own childhood. I feel like I won't find another book I'll enjoy as much as Summer Sisters. Visiting the Vineyard one of these summers is definently a must.
5,Excellent. A work of pure art.,"This was the best Judy Blume book I've ever read in my entire life. The characters she creates are so realistic and lifelike, and the friendship between Vix and Caitlin made me want to laugh and cry. Every page of the book was a sharp turn---I never knew where it would head next. At first I thought I knew how it would end by reading the prolouge, but there are complexities underneath it. If you are a Judy Blume fan, you must read this book. It could easily be a guide to my life. The transitions between teen and adult is rocky yet smooth at the same time. A must read."
5,Entertaining,I am an avid fan of Judy Blume and I loved this book. I had trouble putting this book down. If you enjoyed Forever then I recommend this book.
3,Well written but turns into typical romance novel at end,"A page turner, definitely. But what happened with her career? This turns into an ordinary romance novel."
4,Engrossing reading - not for pre and young teens.,"I loved how Judy Bloom developed her characters. The approach really gave you insite into the ""lives"" and ""thought patterns"" of the characters. It was a different and re-freshing style. My 14 year old is anxious to read it, but I am discouraging her because I don't think she is ready for the level of detail of into the intimate relationships (not just the sex, but the whole concept of a growing, developing young adult romance)"
2,Simplistic - Like watching and episode of Melrose Place,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but the story of the Summer Sisters was one dimensional and disappointing. This book is a quick read and kept my interest most of the time, but the lack of character development and real emotion caused the book to fall short. Also, the detailed description of each sexual encounter reminded me that it would have easier to watch an episode of ""Melrose Place"" than to read this 400 page melodrama. Too bad - I'd hoped for better."
2,This book was one step above pre-teen! Waste of my money,"This book was a fairy tale for one, and I never want to grow up for another...... The most real feeling in this book was when Nathan died, and his character which probably took 7 pages. I kept waiting for more depth, then I realized most times Ms. Blume's world is ""teen"" oriented. I would say go back ""home"" where your more comfortable."
2,When do we get to the meat of the story?,This is the first story of Judy Blume's that I have read. I really felt silly for reading this book as an adult because of the simplistic way it's written. It is more suitable for teenagers. This is one that I won't be sharing with my friends. I'll let my 12 year old read it when she's 16.
2,Blume Just Like I Remember Her,"As a teenage girl, I lived to read Judy Blume's fiction. Unfortunately, she forgets that writing for adults is (or should be) unlike writing for teens. I agree with the reviewer who said to buy this book for your teenage daughter. Purchase yourself a more meaningful work unless you're wistful for that adolescent frame of mind."
5,Invgorating read,"Summer sisters reminded myself of those summer nights spent with friends, and family. Judy Blume has flourished as an adult writer, capturing the reader with in the first few paragraphs...She definatley struck a cord with me, and allowed myself to feel what Vix was feeling."
5,You MUST read this book!!!,"Judy Blume is a master! This book is absolutely wonderful. It is fast-paced and easy to read and it will make you laugh and cry. This book allows you to become so close to the characters because they are so easy to relate to. Everyone can surely relate to the struggles of adolescence and friendship that Vix and Caitlin endure. I suggest that every woman read this book, it is a perfect summer read. You will not be dissappointed."
3,inaccurate details?,"I lost most of my interest in this book after Caitlin and Vix stopped spending their summers together. One thing that caught my attention was that some of the time period references seemed wrong. I'm not sure, but I don't remember seeing Birkenstocks and Tevas as early as they were described in the book, and 90210 wasn't on yet in 1987. It's minor, but I usually enjoy those details when they're accurate."
2,"""Forever"" all over again","I was looking forward to reading this book, as I loved Judy Blume's books as a child/young adult. Unfortunately, while I have grown as a person and in my reading choices, Ms. Blume's writing hasn't kept pace. Her main characters were uninteresting, one dimensional, and focused almost exclusively on sex. It was in the same genre as ""Forever"", only marketed to adults."
3,Disappointing read from a cutting-edge author,"I studied Blume's works 20+ years ago in an graduate course and am disappointed that she seems to have sunk to the level of the common denominator for adolescent/young adult literature. I found no magic at all in Summer Sisters and worse, could feel the reach for it. Maybe it's because I am middle aged but I found it not only predictable but stereotypical. The fact that the ending was so unpredictable contrasted starkly with the rest of the book."
2,A quick read but dissapointing,I enjoyed the book and read it quickly but was left feeling dissapointed. It felt like a book for young readers. I never felt the love Vix felt for Caitlan -- just appreication for the opportunities her friendship gave her. I bought the fun they had as kids but lost it soon after. We never got to know Caitlan has anything but shallow and shelfish -- why would Vix love her?
2,As much depth and relevance as an I-Can-Read Book!,"I gave this book to my mother for her birthday foolishly relying on the best seller list as a guarantee of a good read. While I experienced a fairly typical childhood, I failed to recognize Caitlin and Vix as realistic adolescents. After I read this childish (The Power?!!), melodramatic drivel, I shared my disappointment with my mom. She told me that she, too, thought the book was for teeny boppers. She hadn't shared her assessment with me before because she didn't want to hurt my feelings. I imagine this book will make its way through the seventh grade with the ""appropriate"" pages dog-eared and the ""hot"" sentences underlined just like Blume's novels Forever and Wifey did when I was 13 years old."
2,not a winner,"Generally, Judy Blume has a fine-tuned ear for the nuances of language and angst of young characters. I have been less impressed by her ""grown-up"" novels (i.e., Wifey). Here she succeeds with neither the teenaged characters nor the adults. I was very disappointed, as was my 15 year old daughter. We are both fans of Judy Blume, but not of this book. Summer Sisters lacks plot, character development or much interest. One of the characters describes herself as just selfish and spoiled--and indeed she is. Sorry, but that does not make for a good read."
2,A very shallow book with a tidy little ending,"Judy Blume should stick with the preteen set if this is as good as it gets. The story was pale and the ending was trite. With all of the great story tellers out there, how did this get on the best seller's list? I gave it a 2 star rating because it was easy to read...too easy. Shear drivel."
1,Disappointment,"I was a big fan of Judy Blume while I was growing up, so I couldn't wait to read Summer Sisters. I found this book to be hard to follow without much plot. Although it is an easy read, I thought I would never get through it. I couldn't make myself get interested. If you really want to read it, save your money and wait for the paperback."
4,Enjoyable summer reading,"This is the story of Caitlin & Vix (Victoria), two young girls that met in Elementary school. Their friendship begins in 1977 when Caitlin invites Vix to spend the summer at her cottage by the ocean on Vineyard beach. Judy Blume takes us on their journey through teenage years right into adulthood. Friendships ; how often they can become bittersweet...to what length is Caitlin willing to go to find happiness ? Could she even betray her best friend ? Why can't she find contentment in her life? Why is it that even as adult we sometimes look for answers outside ourselves?It's all about choices and how they affect our lives and the choices these two girls make are very different yet through thick and thin their frienship remains.This book is about sisterly love and the real bound that exist when you have a true friend.This was a great summer read for my vacation."
3,Disappointing...,"When I heard that this book was out, I can't wait to get it. But when I started to read this book, I found that it was disappointing. I have been reading Judy Blume's books since I was in Primary School (That's grade school for some of you), I still think that the books written by her for the younger readers are much more satisfying."
3,Summertime Read,Sometimes friendship endures through the times and changes of life and sometimes it doesn't. This book is about a time when it did. Interesting character development of Vix and Caitlin and a varied backdrop of other players. I thought it was entertaining but not 5 star material.Sandra Wilkes
1,This is really a Kids book,"This book was marketed as Judy Blume for adults but ir really isn't. I read all of Judy Blume's books when I was kid and enjoyed them, so when this came out in paperback I thought I'd try it.Sadly, this book reminded me of Are You There God it's me Margret, with more sex. If Judy Blume really wants to write an adult book she has to do more than just throw in some sex to make it adult. She needs to challange her readers, this book challanges teens not adults!"
5,A great book to share around.,This is a wonderful book for both women and teenage girls. I would love to have been able to have discussed it in a mother and daughter book club. I shared my copy with my mother who also loved the charaters in the book. We both shared our outrage at Catlin. I feel this is what Judy Blume wanted as we all have had someone in our lives like Catlin I waited to buy it in paperback and wished I hadn't. I will try to preserve my copy until my daughter is old enough to read it.
4,I love this book!,"This is a fast-paced, moving story portraying a very special, magical and complicated friendship. It takes us through the girls' adolescent years til they grow up and get their own jobs. The two girls had very different characters, one who's outrageous, adventurous and loves excitment. The other, who's self confident,harding working and trustworthy. The two survive difficult times and laugh through their fun times together. How can this friendship break? What came in between them? This book is great for everyone, to those who have- or haven't- experienced the true meaning of friendship. This book will bring you sometimes joy, sometimes tear, or maybe both at the same time. Two thumbs up, Blume! You're my favorite author!"
4,Great book!,"I'm not the intended audience for this book, but out of curiosity about the book I ordered it, and was pleasantly surprised! This is a fantastic book. Judy Blume keeps the characters seeming real, and you end up caring about them. I have to say that I ended up disliking Caitlin because of how she seemed to be - if there had been some parts of it from her perspective, maybe we would understand her better. Nonetheless, I definitely recommend this book. Vix is a great character, and you keep hoping her life will bring her to happiness. If you like Judy Blume ... buy this book."
2,Ever the same,"Just the same story at the beginning like some others. Just so simple. A ""friendship"". Why didn't she write about other things. You can read so much books and it's so often like the same story. It's not amazing that some people, which had read this book, are not so happy as some other times. I think that some readers will never read some books from Judy Blume."
2,Stick with Blume's childrens books,"As an educator, I've always been a big fan of Blume's childrens literature. However, this adult novel fell short. I felt as thought I was reading a cheap romance complete with a predictable plot and shallow characters. I finshed the book but it was a chore. The characters were mildly interesting but I couldn't really relate to any of their trials and tribulations."
3,"An okay read, but not my old Judy","I am a huge Judy Blume fan. Even at age 24, I still re-read ""Are you there God..."" and others on occasion. I love Judy's books and have always felt a bond with the characters in her books. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed with this book. I just couldn't relate to Vix or Caitlin. I, too, have a best friend/soul mate who I grew up with. But we don't/didn't share the Power and Ang never treated me like Caitlin treated Vix! I just never felt the real bond between these supposed summer sisters... Aside from the characters, the writing just didn't flow naturally, like Judy's words normal do... At times, I felt like I was reading a bad Danielle Steele book. Overall, I enjoyed this book, but still find her old classics to be much more engaging, enlightening, and realistic. I'll stick to Deenie and Margaret - or even Blubber - next time I need a Judy Blume fix."
4,Blume in Adulthood,"As someone who enjoyed Judy Blume's books growing up, I also felt until recently that her writing would never appeal to me now. I picked up this book at the airport out of desperation, a flight delay followed by four hours in the sky awaiting me, with slim-pickings at the terminal bookstore. It really captured me - the references, music & styles of my teen & pre-teen years - and reminded me of who I was then & the things I've gone through in my life. A fun & quick diversion, perfect for the plane, beach and as an entertaining before-bed read."
5,GREAT GREAT BOOK,I read it twice - it is a great book that I would recommend to all of my girlfriends.
3,Nasty Way To Get To A Good Story,"I think that the book is very good. I don't think it was unnecessary to have such a nasty beginning because most people do not do those things. I think that if Caitlyn had had more direction in her life, and more guidance, she wouldn't have turned out the way she had. That is why she didn't go to college and marry well."
1,The worst book I have ever read...,This book is a goofy look at sex from I don't know whose perspective! No one could be as stupid as the characters in this book. Absolute trash.
1,"An ""adult novel""????????",Doesn't it say enough that many of these good reviews came from teenage girls? When I finished this book I felt as if someone had insulted my intelligence. Judy needs to stick to the young-adult genre.
2,I felt like I was 12 again,"I grew up reading Judy Blume's books, and to tell you the truth, I would have rather spent my time re-reading Superfudge. This book was so predictable-I read in in a few hours while strnded at the airport. I just didn't feel anything for these characters, except for disbelief that they could be so unrealistic. Someone mentioned Lamb and Abby taking Vix in even when Caitlin wasn't there. That is so unrealistic. This was a good quick read, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Read Otherwise KNown as Sheila the Great or Are You There God it's Me Margaret if you really want to be entertained. I must say though, that she did get the scenery right. I grew up right across the way from the Vineyard, and the setting is dead on. It was cool to read about places I knew."
2,not very good,"This book dissapointed me alot. I read many great reveiws of it, and the book was really dissapointing. It didn't have any depth to it, and I thought it should have been much more 'real.' All the sex was very dissapointing, I felt like that was what the book was about, instead of a story of friendship."
1,Could we get any more trivial and pathetic??,"I was so disappointed with this book due to its lack of depth and overabundance of trivial issues and teenage immaturity. One can't call it a childrens' book either (although that is how it reads) because of the explicit and annoyingly frequent sex-scenes. Then again, it is far from an adult piece because of its lack of maturity and significance. I think Blume is underestimating the intelligence of the average adult reader by thinking we would care about Vix and Caitlin and all of their raunchy and pathetic love adventures. If a picture of a loin-clothed Fabio was on the cover, it would give the reader more of an idea of what they were considering reading."
2,Disappointing,"I could not wait to read this book because I absolutely loved and was captivated by July Blume's young adult novels when I was younger. But I'm sorry to have to say that I was nothing but greatly disappointed with this Judy Blume adult novel. For the first time, I was unable to relate to or comprehend any of the characters and was disappointed with such a poor storylines given to them.Blume fails to develop the characters with any real depth or personality, other than to develop them sexually. She also fails to develop personal storylines in this novel that are realistic or that keep your attention. It's hard to believe that the two main characters would be friends or remain friends.If you are looking for a book about real friendship, don't buy this book. If you are looking for a book about two females having sex with each other as teens, then with a bunch of guys, and eventually with each other's boyfriend, then buy this book."
1,Not for Young Adults,"Not at all what I expected from the reviews. This book is not for young adults and was offensive to me, an adult. Having been offended before the third chapter, this book went back to library unread."
1,Trash,"I cannot believe the reviews for this book. After reading almost half of the book, I just couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't boring, it was just pure trash (and that's just where it ended up). I certainly can't believe that there are ""kid"" reviews on this book. I would never let my teenager read this. Trashy sex does not make for a good book. I feel like my IQ has dropped tremendously. This woman writes like a teenager herself... so juvenile. What junk!"
4,Great Book!,"I am an adolescent girl, and this book was really great. I loved how Judy Blume, whose books like Superfudge and Deenie I read when I was younger, has written a lovely story about the bond between two girls that happened over a summer and lasted for a lifetime. Throughout the betrayls and disappointments going on in the lives of the characters, this book stays interesting and doesn't disappoint. However, it wasn't absolutely fabulous (it seemed a bit long) but nonetheless a great read."
5,Eternal Summer,"399 pages of a pure escape. Summer Sisters by Judy Bloom is book that every young women should experience. It will take you to the times in your life that you want to relive, to the places where friendship is life, and summer is eternal. This fast reading book gives you advice, makes you cry and of course makes you smile. I finished it in two days, and it proved to me that free reading books are more than the Shakespeare plays I never understood in high school. Reading was always a chore, however, Judy Bloom makes it an exciting adventure. Every young women's dreams, aspirations and confusions are held in the hands of the "" summer sisters."""
2,Book due in 2 weeks & Judy forgot she promised to write it.,"Sorry, Judy, stick with what you know. A six hour read with at least that many unnecessary characters. Most notably, Dinah Renko. (Sucks and chews her hair???) Next in line would be D'Nisha. Even Trisha was a stretch. All I could think of when Lamb was in the picture was ""Mick Fleetwood"". When I finished the book I kept turning pages thinking there was more. Vix didn't need closure for her break-up with Bru; I need it for reading this book."
2,Not worth the money,"I was on a vacation and looking for a good read when I picked up this book. I loved Judy Blume's charming books as a kid, (Fudge, Are you There God, etc.) and thought her writing style in Summer Sisters would be a grown-up equivalent. I was pretty darn disappointed. The book sort of reminds you of wanna-be, second-rate Danielle Steele. Judy Blume's trying hard to be racy, but the characters are totally two-dimensional and seem like ridiculous caricatures. The book is totally predictable: Vix, the solid, dependable friend meets Caitlin, the man-crazy bad girl. Ever read Sweet Valley High? That's the level of writing we're talking about here. The plot just kind of rambles, and the ending just seems lame. Blech."
2,"Ever read 'Mademoiselle"" magazine?","Trite and bland, but it tries so hard to be hip. You can't help but despise all the characters. Vix is a doormat, Caitlin is selfish and vicious, her dad smoked too much pot and his brain is mush, Tawny is an iceberg, her husband is a pushover (wonder where Vix learned her ways)... I mean, what a collection of inadequate people. The author does not make anyone endearing. Just a waste of time."
3,A good vacation read!,"Take this one on the plane. It's quick and easy to read. Blume creates real characters that probably will mirror people you have met in real life. In particular, I enjoyed this book because the ages of the characters matched my own coming-of-age years. Blume's characters, complete with all their flaws, are genuine and likable.On the downside, this book's plot is preditable. It reminded me of watching a TV series (albeit, a steamy one).Enjoy this book at the beach or on the plane. If you keep your expectations low, Summer Sisters is a good way to kill a few hours."
2,Entertaining summer fluff,"I'd actually give it 2 1/2 stars, but Amazon doesn't have an option for half stars, so two it is.It took me about 5 hours to read this book, it is definitely not challenging, but the main characters are engaging. I think one of the greatest appeals of this novel, for me, was the fact that it took place in the years of my own childhood, with characters that were just a few months older than I.If you are looking for an entertaining but simple read for your vacation, this is the book to get."
3,"A typical summer read, not too much effort required.","My fourteen year old daughter read it first and was thrilled. While she was truly drawn into the characters, I found I was exhausted by them. Thank goodness I don't have to live their lives. The characters of Caitlin and Vix were flat,the male characters short changed, the storyline pure summer plot with little thought provoking images. The best part of the book was discussing it with my daughter so we could point out the good, bad and ugly!"
4,It was worth the sun burn i got trying to finish it!,"i brought ""Summer Sisters"" to the Jersey shore with me on vacation.....and it was worth the sun burn i got while trying to finish it before leaving the beach. The characters were fresh and story was entralling. I grew up almost during the same time period that the book took place, so I identified with the events of the time. I also found it very interesting that it took place on the Vineyard since the tragic Kennedy disaster brought it into the news so recently. It made the book more realistic. I can only hope there is a sequel. Thanks Judy! A devoted reader, Dena."
4,"Close, but not completely there...","This book no doubt mesmerized me until I finished it (a day & a half later). It brought back a rush of feelings from my youth, the ones that make me appreciate being an adult... Although I did think this was a GREAT book, I just felt like the reason there were so many synapses on what the charachters were thinking was because Blume didn't really delve into who Vix & especially Caitlin really were. Definitely a light, fun summer read..."
2,"A quick, predictable read","If you'd like to read a story where you simply watch two not-so-exciting lives click by, this is the book for you! As for me I'm going to go reread ""Are You There God..."" and see who has changed more in the last 20 years- me or Judy Blume!"
2,I expected more from this author,"This was one of those books I kept reading thinking it had to get better, but it failed to do so. I could find little in the two main characters to relate or to care about."
3,"Nice, easy summer reading","This book is perfect for anyone who wants a quick, easy read . True to Judy Blume style, there's romance, lust and betrayal. But, if you're looking for a true literary work, this one isn't for you."
5,EXCELLENT,"This book is for every woman who has grown up with a good close friend, it re-kindles those childhood memories, thoughts,and dreams. I couldn't put this book down and I gave it to my mother and my sister."
3,Good entertainment,"Someone said in an earlier review that there are no answers to why some of us continue friendships with women who break our hearts over and over. God...that is so true. And maybe that is what appealed to me about this story. I have a friendship like that and I always worry that people think I am crazy for staying with it. But now I know that there must be millions of women who really do understand that sometimes there are bonds that can't be broken for any reason.I had bought the hardcover long before the paperback came out, but waited to read it until I was vacationing on Martha's Vineyard last week. I liked reading about the island while I was there, and I'd forgotten how sex ridden Blume's adult books are. Definitely a good beach read!I would recommend the paperback, especially since it is so inexpensive. Don't expect any fabulous literature, but do expect to be sucked into the friendship of Vix and Caitlin, and do expect to want to go to Martha's Vineyard!"
2,shallow fun- a quick fix,"I can't believe how many people have used the word ""depth"" in their reviews. You can't get much farther from depth than this book. The juicy scenes, for those who like them, are what makes this book at least somewhat readable and fun. Other than that, it is unrealistic and the story line seems to have sprung straight from ""Days of our Lives"", or worse. And please- it just reconfirms the ""weak, overly obsessed with personal matters"" type of female stereotype, that most of us have tried to escape from. If any man should be dumb enough to read this book- please remember, some of us are sane."
2,"Little substance, lotsa sex","I bought this book after Newsday, L.I. Newspaper listed it on a ""great summer reads"" list. Accepting that 100 different people enjoy a book for 100 different reasons, I'm one that appreciates depth and sentiment rather than sexual scenes between underage teenage girls.I doubt if this book ever put Blume on the next century's best authors list, nor will it be considered a classic. I'm sure it will have an audience for those who prefer an occassional cheap thrill from a book and impressionable young teens curious about sex.Summer Sisters begins with two girls rubbing their privates together until climax, amid a ramshackled flop of a house, on an island where their pillows are mouldy, and Caitlin's private parts smelly because she never showers. If that appeals to you, then read the book for it never moves the reader very far from that same level of integrity in every other scene or scenario."
1,horrible and not worth your money,I think this was the worst excuse for literature that I have read. The charecters are discusting and the book is filled with not a story but diffrent episodes of sexual occrences. There was no plot or story to trace if you're still interested check it out from a librarey and don't waste your money!
2,A very cheap novel,"When I first had ""Summer Sisters"" in my hands, I couldn't wait to start reading it. But when I started reading it, little by little, I began to feel as if I was reading one of those cheap novels with Fabio hadlf naked on the cover. Summer Sisters has a lot of sex, lots, and lots of it, and the worst of all, is that it disgusts you. The two main characters, when they are 12, rub their private parts against each other to feel ""the power"", as it says in the book. - I wanted to vomit! It is a very cheap novel. Don't read it."
2,Summer Sisters,"Was very disappointed with this book. First of all, it had MANY curse words including the F word which I HATE. It also had a continuous thread of sexual content. I was very surprised that Judy Blume would write a story like this. It was a very depressing story. Wish I had not spent my money on this book. Thumbs down!!!"
1,Not Very Good,"This is pretty much a soap opera in the form of a book, nothing interesting, leaves much to be desired. So boring I have yet to finish reading, even after two months. The story starts out OK but after fifty pages or so begins to really drag on, plus there are way to many filler pages. A good read if you have trouble sleeping."
2,okay but needs to brush up ending,"summer sisters is a good book but the ending is rushed and it doesn't make sense to me. also, Judy blume doesn't tell what is happening in Caitlens point of view so the book is not complete. plus everyone knew that caitlen would disappear in the end. the only exciting bits was when they were kids. when they grow up, it get complicated with all the monologues and all. I would not suggest this to another person it is not all that good and does not deserve all the praise it got. Judy Blume should work on kid books."
3,Shallow,"Summer Sisters was a little shallow and vacuous for my taste. I've read other Blume books that were a lot better. I am more of a ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", or ""The Triumph and the Glory"" type, eager to read about women making their own way in the world without depending upon sex or relationships with men to justify their existence or measure themselves against themselves or other women."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS THAT I HAVE EVER READ.,"SUMMER SISTERS IS BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS THAT I HAVE EVER READ. IT WAS SO GOOD THAT I FINSHED IT IN 2 DAYS. IF YOU HAVE NOT READ IT, DO SO, AND IF YOU HAVE, READ IT AGAIN."
1,Inappropriate for Young Adults.,"Someone somewhere has decided that because ""Summer Sisters"" follows the life of two women from the time they are twelve until they are thirty that this book crosses over into the Young Adult category. They couldn't be more wrong! The book contains vulgar language, graphic sex, and generally is not for the pre-college crowd. The story itself has been told too many times before by Danielle Steel, Judith Krantz, Sydney Sheldon, et al. If you fell compelled to read the top ten bestsellers, then go ahead and read the book. Otherwise, give it a 'Pass.'"
5,A truly enjoyable read,"Judy Blume's characters are so real, I felt like they were people in my family. This book made me laugh, cry, and remember my own friends and summer sisters, and the trials and tribulations of coming of age."
4,Excellent book,This is definately a must have. I remember growing up on Judy Blume books. This brought back many memories. Vix and Catlin are great. I couldn't put it down. Read it in 2 days!!!
2,Blume should stick with her stories of adolescent angst.,"I enjoyed ""Wifey"", her first adult novel, quite a bit more. I have read every single one of her young adult novels and loved them all; I'm encouraging my children to read them as well. I was disappointed in ""Summer Sisters"", I found it to be more similar to paperback romance novels than to the quality I'm used to from this author. A good beach read, but once read, soon forgotten. I found Caitlin annoying and Vix one-dimensional. Ellen Feldman, Elizabeth Berg, Beth Gutcheon do this genre so much better"
1,This book was pointless.,"I could find nothing of particular interest in the characters or plot of this novel. Page after page of childish, empty actions by childish, empty people. Sex seemed to be the only motivation for any of the characters. The main character might have had some depth, but it was never developed to any extent. I don't even want to lend this book to anyone - why should they bother to read it? I wish I hadn't."
1,I do not think it was a good book,"I would not read this book again. If you want to have your girls get into living with her friends and not worry about them, this book is for them. I would never let any of my girls read this book. I thought it was an awful story and I really felt bad someone took the time to write it."
3,Too much sex,"This book involves way too much sex. I would not want anyone under 18 to even read it! In this day and age with HIV and AIDS and all the other horribly infectious diseases out there we should try to be moving AWAY from teens and sex. They should not be encouraged in any way. At least Judy Blume mentions comdoms....All in all, this novel depicts sex as the only thing that keeps people together (Vix and Bru) and I find that outrageous."
1,No redeaming value,"This is the first book that I ever threw in the trash! There's no redeaming value to the story. I wouldn't want anyone (especially young impressional readers) to submit themselves to this mindless garbage. VERY disappointed! Judy, shame on you!"
2,What a disappointment!,"From reading the summary, i thought this book would be a keeper. But into the first few chapters I was already regretting to read it! I didn't like most of the sexual content...just didn't think it was necessary to the storyline in most cases. Blume could've sent the same message to the reader w/o getting so perverted in every chapter! I'm returning my copy for another one of Oprah's fabulous picks."
1,Pass it by!,"I bought this book thinking it would be a great story about Cape Cod (a favorite vacation spot of my family's) and found that it was merely trash. This book was a total disappointment. It was a book about teenage love and sex and, in my opinion, a total waste of time!"
3,Pretty dull,"I, like many others, read the reviews for this book on the back of the book after finding it in the store. As you know from my other reviews on Judy Blume's adult books, I have had mixed feelings about them. This one, there is no confusion whatsoever. I found this book to be pretty boring. There was no edge to it unless you count the exploration of lesbianism at about the age of 11 or 12. I don't find that edgy. I find that disturbing. The book was highly predictable. While it is a quick read, I wish I spent the time reading something more entertaining and substantial. Wifey creeped me out, Smart Women was at least interesting, but this one was just a waste of time. Ms. Blume spent a lot of time developing characters, but they weren't characters you care about in the end. The only character that I did like was Caitlin's new stepmom, Abby. The only good thing that happened in the book was that it ended."
1,trash for who? and not well written trash either!,"Who is this poor writing, character development, plot, written for?! After reading SUMMER SISTERS I (was dumb enough to) read SMART WOMEN and the same questions apply. These are not soap opera, not even good trash reading. They are a waste of natural resources and time.I will go back and read her children's books becasue I wonder what is wrong with HER or US."
3,Summer Sisters,"Well, I'll have to say that I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this one. It was an eBook from my public library. This was a hands-down let down!! I was really disappointed with the ending."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"From the age of about 12 my best friend, her family and I would travel to Cape Cod for 2 weeks every summer & a few weekends - it was during the summer I turned 14 that I first read this book - AMAZING - Maybe it was the similar storyline to my own life [though not really aside from vacationing with my best friend every summer!] but I could not put this book down! Judy Blume has a way of captioning in on every emotion & connecting with the reader on so many levels - I remember reading this book the first time feeling as though I could relate. I read this again in college - again I understood everything the main character was going though - even now as a married adult I still pick it up every few years and am instantly drawn back into the tale of friendship, first love, true love and growing up. It's a great book for anyone aged 13 and older I would say - defintely read it!"
1,too much information,"The concept behind this story is a good one---a relationship between 2 young girls as they grow into adults. But, the writer went into too much detail when describing love scenes. It would make a much better read to leave something to my own imagination. After I finished this book, I threw it into the garbage since I did not want to pass it on, or re-read."
4,Enjoyable read,"I was surprised by how much I liked this book, it was a lot better than I thought it would be. The characters are interesting, the story moves along at a quick pace, the author has a way of making you really care about the people in this book. I was a little disappointed by the ending, but I would still highly recommend this book."
2,Mindless,I loved Judy Blume books as a child--obviously I've grown up. This served it's purpose--it entertained me on a train ride from Philly to New York. But it was pretty simplistic and unrealistic. I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you are really into reading a book that reads like a soap opera.
5,I loved this book!,Summer Sisters a story any girl can appriciate. I finished in a day. It sucks you in and leaves you thinking about it for days. I had to call my best friend and cry when I finished. Needless to say she called me crying the next day when she finished it!
5,A Perfect Summer Read,"I read Summer Sisters while on vacation this summer, and I could not put it down. Of course, I had remembered Judy Blume from my days in middle school, but this book provided me with the same thrill I received all those years ago... It made me feel like a teenager again. I felt myself growing up and maturing with the two main characters, Cait and Vix. I wanted to be on Martha's Vineyard with them instead of a cabin in the mountains where I read this book. Buy this book now, but wait until the summer to read it, or during the dead of winter when getting cabin fever! Although not incredibly complex, the characters grew throughout the story, and it definitely should be passed on to others, I know my own copy has traveled to several friends, just like Blume's books did in 7th grade! Read this book and you will feel rejuvenated!"
1,Could I give it ZERO stars??,"This is not Judy Blume quality. I was disappointed and expected more. Too sexual for teens, too immature for adults. I guess she was aiming at the soap opera audience. Aim higher, Judy."
1,It(s) [no good].,"There is nothing interesting about this book. The story rambled on endlessly and ultimately went absolutely nowhere; the characters were boring, unlikeable and undeveloped (each character is virtually the exact same person at the beginning of the novel as at the end, even though over 20 years had elapsed - nobody learns from their past, no one evens tries). Plot? Don't bother looking - it's not there. Even the sex scenes, which were plentiful, were tepid. I only completed this idiotic book because I was on a plane and couldn't chuck it out the window. It consumed 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back. Don't let it happen to you."
2,Thumbs down,"I recently picked up my copy of Summer Sisters and thought, I really should give this another go. So I read it again, hoping that my first opinion would change and I would have all the positive feelings that the other readers have had here. I tried really hard, I loved Judy Blume when I was young and have always admired her sense of humour and her ability to create ""real characters."" Summer Sisters starts off really well with the girls meeting and forming a solid friendship but sadly begins to become silly, especially in the last third of the book when the betrayals of Vix and Caitlin become evident. If you need a book to fill in the hours on a long flight or just something that doesn't take much concentration then this is a good book I guess. For once it would be nice to see Blume write a novel for adults that doesn't revolve around sex, other authors manage it and if they do include it, they use more taste than she does."
2,Yuk,"I did finish it but barely. I've read some Judy Blume and liked her, but not this silly, trite, superficial nonsense. The two main characters travel all over the world, go to fabulous colleges and yet end up with the boys they met in junior high, just to further this silly plot. The characters are completely one dimensional, the very short (one page or less) ""chapters"" written from different points of view add nothing. THe characters' names even bothered me - Lamb, Vix, Bru, Von. Puhleeze."
3,"Its a quick read, but it lacks a theme.","This book was a easy read. But there was no theme whatsoever in this book. There where three stages in the book doing and thinking about the same thing(Sex more than any meaningful relationship) as children, adolscent and Adult. The charactes depicted are not unique and we have come across them in several other books and movies."
4,I thought this was truly a wonderful and engrosing book,Judy Blume was my favroite author as a young reader and now with thebook Summer Sisters I know why. Blume captures the magic of summer on the Vinyard and the problems that many young people face as they grow up and often away from their childhood friends.
2,"A Quick ""Just O.K."" Read","I have enjoyed Judy Blume's books since I was a kid. While I liked the style of the story-telling in Summer Sisters, I was left wanting more. More depth, more detail, more character development. I felt like a kid again reading this book, for the wrong reasons!"
3,I loved it and hated it.,"Summer Sisters is a great, light summer read. After reading some other readers' reviews, I understand both those who loved it and hated it. I relived certain times in my life when I was just like the two main characters. And am SO glad to not have to do it again! However it is frustrating the way this book, along with ""Bridget Jones'Diary"" are both bestsellers AND portray women as valuing their worth by the men that love them - not for who they really are. I believe that women today are being given a warped and mixed-up view of our place in today's society."
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable!!!!,"This is my first time ever reading a Judy Blume book. It took me less than 24 hours to finish. It was captivating and very real, I can definetly identify with many of the issues. In fact, I will be sending a copy of the book to my best girlfriend in Jamaica."
4,Not what I expected!!,"I actually read this book twice. The first time, just the first 3 chapters, and I took it back to the library as I couldn't get into it. Checked it out again a few weeks later, and couldn't put it down!"
3,Forgettable Summer Sisters,"I haven't read anything from Judy Blume since I read Freckle Juice and Are You There God...when I was a kid, and I have to say I was disappointed. I didn't care all that much about what happened to Vix, and even less about Caitlin. Blume's other books are timeless and unforgettable. Unfortunately, Summer Sisters is not up to par, and is entirely forgettable."
4,Good Read,"I think this book is great! It gives a great dipiction of what growing up is all about. The nervousness, anxiety and general helplessness that Vix feels is exactly how a young teenage girl trying to fit in can feel. I think Judy Blume has taken her knowledge from her years of ""teenage books"" and done a great job with ""Summer Sister""!"
5,fantastic book,this book was very well written. i literally read it in one day and did not want it to end. i think that some of the material is inappropriate for young readers and they wouldn't even get the emotions behind a majority of the book. i thoroughly enjoyed this book
3,A Good Read,"This book was an easy read and quite enjoyable. However, I was completely fed up with the character of Caitlin and what a self-absorbed poor little rich girl she was made out to be. And Vix shouldn't have been nicknamed ""cough drop"" but ""doormat"". I lost all sympathy for both by the end of the book."
3,sluggish through the beginning but worth reading in the end,"My best friend informed me that I had to read this book and get back to her. After half a day of straight reading I was glad I made it through the first, drawn-out 250 pages. At times I felt that the language called too much to her younger crowd but nevertheless it was a real time machine back to the early days of my closest friendships."
4,You'll like all the characters in this fun read...,"I loved the tale of the two different, entertwined characters over the years. The pages where an individual character would comment were woven in beautifully and gave insight into all the supporting characters too!"
1,"Trashy, mindless rubbish",Since I had to choose between one and five stars I gave it a one star. It doesn't even deserve that! I would not advise anyone to waste their time reading this book. Many of the characters never evolved in my mind. Even the main characters were not believable. There has got to more than just self gratifacation in most people's lives. I could never imagine why the two main characters even liked each other. I still can't believe I actually finished it. I thought there may be some fantastic story line. In the end it was all just nothing. Certainly no value as a book for anyone in my opinion. Very disappointing reading.
2,Not a bad read on a 5-hr plane ride,"I would not call this book the most intellectually stimulating, but if you're sitting on a plane for 5 hours, it will keep you preoccupied and you'll probably finish it. The characters are a little shallow, but the story moves quickly enough. I finished it on the plane!"
4,Givers and takers,"I really didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book. When reading a book by an author with works as diverse as ""Then Again, Maybe I Won't"" and ""Wifey,"" well, I really didn't know how to calibrate my expectations.But the book was great on its own terms. There's an endearing quality to the protagonist Victoria ""Vix"" Leonard that can only be achieved by a good author (although Caitlin Somers never achieved the full three dimensions for me, but perhaps that's because her character is secondary). The story is good and moves right along. But what I like most about the book is its theme of vindication: the good and the just are rewarded for their deeds and the unjust are, in one form or another, punished, usually as a result of their own poor choices. I'm not talking about a morality tale per se, but rather confirmation that in life, people who do the right thing generally succeed, and those who do not, do not."
1,Not fit for adults,I'm sorry to say I bought this book based on the fact that it was on the best seller list and was suggestedto me through Amazon.com. I believe it's time to update my profile because there must be a rating that suggests I may have enjoyed this book. I'd be curious to find out what the average age of the readers of this book are. It was very immature. Not well written at all. As a matter of fact I didn't even finish the novel. I had maybe 50 pages to go and didn't give a rip how it ended. I donated it to the local thrift shop as I would have been too embarrassed to pass it on.
4,A page-turner filled with fun characters,"Let me put it this way--I finished the book in two days. Very readable, very interesting, quite a page-turner.I loved Blume's ""Fudge"" books when I was younger and wanted to read this book from the moment I saw it. I wasn't disappointed.Blume gives us a good story and fun characters to jump around the chapters with. Although I didn't become attached to any certain one, I find myself thinking about them now that I'm done with the novel. And Blume's ability to switch personas nearly every other page (the story follows Vix, but Blume gives us insight into different characters' minds as well) is well honed.It will keep you going till the end."
4,"I usually cannot ""get into"" fiction anymore...","... opting for non fiction now as an adult, but the characters in this novel were compelling. Judy Blume has a knack for getting readers involved in the characters she creates. When I still had 100 pages left I couldn't help reading the last chapter to find out what would happen to them. That knowledge didn't make the last chapter the second time around any less emotional. I found it interesting that the choice Vix made at age 12, to spend the summer with Caitlin on Martha's Vineyard, changed her future completely. Also that the fate of a character I didn't care for left me profoundly touched, says something about the quality of the plot and characters. I am only ranking this story with four stars because I don't think I will read it again the way I repeatedly reread Judy Blume's children books when I was a child. I cannot put my finger on why I won't read it again though.."
5,"Summer romance, summer friends but lifetime memories","I love it!! I am now 22yrs. old and have always loved Blume's work. But this struck home. How many of us have experienced a summer flig with your summer girlfriend. Blume gave us a look at two different girls who spend the summer together and athough they are complete opposite with different values on everything, the two of them need and want each other more than they know it. I had a summer friend who I spent every waken moment with her and then teh boys. :) I recommend this book to any women who once had or wanted to have a summer sister. As a reading teacher, I don't recommend this book for any teenager or young reader, this an adult book."
2,Not as good as others I have read by this author,"I was dissappointed in this novel. Sure the story development was fine and I like the way Ms. Blume showed each characters' thoughts, but it seemed to me that it wasn't much of a story. Who hasn't had a friend from the time they were young and gone through even more than the two main characters did? I had a best friend from third grade that slept with my boyfriend and she didn't run away for years and then come up missing.The only reason I finished this book is that it was the only thing I had to read on the plane."
5,I felt like a teenager again!,"Summer Sisters took me back to a time I had almost forgotten. I'm 33 years old and, like Vix, was just coming of age in the seventies. I couldn't put the book down and, like many of the other reader's who have posted reviews, finished it in less than two days. I look forward to reading Blume's next release."
3,ENJOYABLE FAST READ BUT SIMPLISTIC,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK, HOWEVER, FOUND IT TO BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG ADULTS OR OLDER TEENS.. NOT REALLY FOR ADULTS."
2,"a book inappropriate for young readers, too graphic","Summer Sisters had a descent story line; however, I do not feel that all that actually occurs in ones life needs to be written as it was in this book. I would not reccommend it to a young adult reader, maybe an 18-23 year old reader. It was a dissappointment. I simply wish it had been less graphic at certain parts."
1,"If I Hadn't Bought the Audio, I Would Have Never Finished It","The title of the book was the best part of the whole book. The sad thing is, the book had real portential. It's too bad that the writer went from interesting to smut real quick. I wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends."
3,Take it or leave it,"I was really excited that Judy Blume came out with another adult novel, but after reading ""Summer Sisters,"" I feel like I definately could have done without it. The storyline is very intriguing- what a great idea to have a book full of secrets, deception, and growing up. Most of the novel is an easy, effortless read. However, some parts were just too graphic and after reading some of them I remember thinking ""Too much information! ""Bottom line- Not the best book in the world, but it is definately not the worst, either."
4,will keep your attention,especially if you've ever had a close friend or two . . . i found myself caring about the characters and wanted to see how things would work out at the end.
1,I've outgrown this type of writing,"I, too, loved reading Judy Blume books growing up, but as I read Summer Sisters, I realized that I have outgrown this adolescent writing. I found that the ""adult"" books seem to still be written for a younger audience than an adult. I did read the book in about 3 days, but it didn't leave me wanting to continue a relationship with either of the main characters or wonder what she would do in real life situations. Yes, I did have a friend like Caitlin, but I outgrew her as well."
3,"It was Okay, could have been better","I had heard about this book and wanted to read it for a while. I had read Wifey and Are You There God, Its Me Margaret so I had high expectations for this book. Throughout the book I was wondering how it was all going to come together. There were so many characters having their say, in one paragraph chapters. The ups and downs of the friendship between Catilin and Vix and their difference in lifestyles kept me interested."
1,Disappointing and Unbelievably Bad,"I read Judy Blume's books as a girl and was looking forward to reading this book, a gift from my mother-in-law. I found the characters poorly developed and unsympathetic. There was nothing interesting, redeeming or romantic about this book filled with cliches and too much sex. I grew bored halfway through, skipped to the ending, skimmed what was in between, and put the book down in disgust. If you're an adult, don't bother. If you're a teenager, stick to Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. I just could not believe that any serious reader would find this book worth reading."
1,"Shallow reading, easy to tread.","Buy this book for a quick easy read. This book does not deal with any issues at depth. I would recommend this book to lazy readers who don't like or want to think, and adolescent girls. It's a book I would have thoroughly enjoyed at the age of 12 or 13. It is the typical ""teen trash"" novel."
2,Reads like a trashy romance novel,"I loved Judy Blume books as a teenager and this book read like a teenage romance novel. I can't say it was a horrible book, but definitely not too interesting. It seems like the main characters' friendship was not too realistic and the events that occur were pretty dull."
