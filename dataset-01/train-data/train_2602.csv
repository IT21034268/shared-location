1,Much too rough on my skin,I did not like this at all. It was very rough and irritated my skin. I returned it after only a couple of shaves.
1,Really terrible shave,"I spent about 10 days trying to get ""used"" to this shaver. No matter what I did, I could not get a close shave. That's an understatement actually. The shave was just terrible and uneven. I spent at least 10 minutes on each attempt and every time I would have to go over and over and over and over again the same area and not get any closer. I tried two different razor blades with same result. I am surprised to see all the high marks from everyone else. I must have gotten a bad one, or maybe my skin type is so different from everyone else. I decided to give another shot to Merkur and ordered an adjustable Merkur Futur razor. My hope is that I can get a closer shave with that one since I'll be able to adjust for a closer shave. The only upside with this razor was that I never got cut or any irritation - again, b/c the shave was not even close to being close. Definitely was not worth the money I spent on this junk. You'd be better off with a BIC razor."
4,Good,"Item came as described by seller, in perfect condition and in original box. Shipped in perfect timing as well. Nice job."
2,Not working at all for me.,"I have been using this razor for about a week, and when shaving in the direction of the grain it literally just does not work at all. As in, no cuts or nicks, no razor burn, no hair removed. Nothing. All shaves are after taking an extremely hot shower, so it's not that either.I'm definitely new to safety razor shaving, so I keep thinking I'm doing something wrong, but when i shave against the grain it cuts quite close (although leaves me with some razor burn). So I'm honestly at a loss. I'm going to try some new blades (maybe the stock blade that ships with the razor is terrible?) and if that doesn't work, I guess I will have to send it back. Maybe something about my skin. I'll probably try a Merkur Futur if this doesn't end up working, since the blade there is adjustable."
4,New to Wet Shaving - Great Product!,"After months of researching, I decided on this safety razor because of the vast amount of great feedback left. I was not disappointed. I gave away my Gillette Fusion because I am tired of getting ripped off at the store. I am using this razor with Wilkinson Sword safety razor blades from Walmart that are $1.80 for 10 blades. Night and day from the replacements for the Fusion. Stop looking and buy this! You won't be disappointed."
5,Take your time,"I have had this razor for two months (I used to use one like this many years ago). This razor gives a great shave, but only if you don't rush the shave and don't use a lot of pressure during the shave. Let the weight of the razor do the job. Once I learned to not use a lot of pressure when shaving, I got a very close shave....without any cuts or scrapes."
4,"A bit Pricey, but great quality!","Alright, just to clear things up I fall into that category of young people that got tired of those disposable blades made in China that just burn up my face. Now that I got that out of the way...Product Review:First double safety I ever bought.Pros: Solid Design, Probably last forever if taken care ofNice Chrome lookComes with one platinum Merkur Blade BladeIt's about the size of a typical razor, but a bit heavier. This gives it a more solid feel.Cons: Outrageous price for something so simpleDoesn't arrive with anything else.Maybe too heavy? Still gives me razor burn in one section of my neck due to the weight of it. I might just need to improve me technique.All in all, if I did some more research I could probably found something for 1/10th the price that would do the same job. It leaves me a bit sour, but all in all it is classy. Can't complain, would recommend to a friend."
5,DE Beginner; never going back.,"As a DE beginner I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This device is top quality and most utterly useful! A gentlemen's razor. You can tell that this will last multiple lifetimes.I have dropped it a few times and although it has dinged slightly, because of the way it is forged it doesn't lose its awesome finish. Albeit, I do clean it after most shaves, unless I am short on time.In short, if you're doubtful as to which razor to purchase as a first timer or even to have multiple razors, there is no reason why you shouldn't own this simple, yet elegant product!Happy shaving gentlemen!"
5,Excellent shave!,"I'm new to safety razors, but after only one week I am hooked and can't believe they lost market share to the 'other' razors. This model seems well made and is simple to use. After only one use I could tell it caused less irritation than my mach 5 or my norelco aqua razor. In a few days the small amount of acne I usually have which I used to contribute to my physical job and exercise routine really cleared up. If you're on the fence about safety razors watch some videos on how to do it properly and take the plunge."
5,"Finally no more irritation, ingrown hairs and red bumps!","Let me just say I had tried every gimmick, cream, and every marketable disposable blade razor, none worked....till now! So I'm new to DE shaving, it really does work like all the reviews on here say, and I settled on the Merkur because of the reviews, and price.Onto the razor:Like the 4"" long handle, if anything I would prefer it a little longer.Simple, robust, effective 3 piece design.Blade seats straight and true.Cleans very easy, doesn't clog like a multiblade during shaving.Its kind of plain looking but the finish is nice.Since this was my first DE razor I didn't want to drop a ton of money until I figured out if I liked it. Now that I know it works, I may step up to one of these razors someday. [...]Pointers:1. Use shaving soap, brush and mug.2. You don't have to press as hard as with a multiblade.3. Keep a good lather.4. Don't be scared."
5,Awesome,"When I read about the ""learning curve"" with this type of razor, I expected to have to spend a lot of time figuring out how to use it without cutting myself, but it's really not hard. You just take it slow, and pay attention to what you're doing, and sure it takes 30 seconds longer but in 2 months this thing easily paid for itself just because I don't have to spend 15 bucks or more on cartridges. A cheap blade comes out to about 20 cents per blade at the dollar store, lasts just as long as the ""name brand"" cartridges, and still gets a closer shave.And I said it takes 30 seconds longer, but really, if I wanted a shave like this from any of my old razors, I had to shave twice or even 3 times, so technically, it's faster for me and my thick hair."
5,No luck getting a closer shave.,"Maybe it's just my shaving skills or maybe it's my skin but i have very little luck getting a better shave with the Merkur Safety Razor compared to Mach 3 razors. Yes, i tried taking my time and keeping the blade at 30 degrees AND shaving with the grain and not against the grain(which is has always worked best for me) but no luck. Does anyone have any suggestions? I'm considering selling it on Ebay or Amazon if i can.edit: I give it five starts now after the prior 2 stars. I just tried the Feather Razor Blades and they are a quantum leap over the Merkur Razor blades. In fact, i'd say it's pointless to try the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor without the Feather Razor Blades. No longer planning on selling this item on Ebay anymore. You were right on Erik. Thx!"
5,Good razor,"I like this razor. The shave quality is about the same as the seven-bladed Gillette monsters, but the replacement blades cost pennies instead of dollars. Well worth the long-term cost."
2,Didn't work for me,"I ordered this razor based on the positive feedback on Amazon. When I got it, it just didn't work. The blade sat too close to the metal on which it sat. I scoured the internet for shaving instructions, thinking that maybe I was doing it wrong. No matter what I did this razor just didn't work for me... so I returned it to Amazon.Then I ordered the Merkur Futur Double Edge Safety Razor #700, which is adjustable, to see if that would work better for me. It does indeed! So now that I have a basis for comparison, I can honestly say that this razor just doesn't cut it (pun intended). The Futur works great, though it more than twice as expensive.The good news is that it is really easy to return this razor to Amazon if it doesn't work for you, so there's not really any risk involved."
4,Good basic razor - No extra bells and whistles,"Little tricky to change the blade as you need to unscrew the handle and take a part a couple of pieces, but the price, balance and comfort way outweigh the cons.I think I will be using this for a long-long while"
5,Merkur 180 Long,Love this razor. Nice and hefty. Very easy to change blade. Good grip. Shaves like a dream. One setting.
5,Great razor! much better than my $9 cheap-o DE,"The head of this razor is very well balanced and actually makes a big difference in keeping the blade at the correct angel. shaves smoother than the cheap-o $9 DE razor I first tried. I use razor, Poraso pre-shave, Poraso shaving cream (in the tube), Feather DE blades, and Burt's Bees aftershave and shaving is now a pleasurable experience no longer to be dreaded."
5,Long handle razor,"Having tried the shorter Merkur razor, I decided I needed a longer handle. This one is about 4 inches and allows me to hold and control the razor very well. Just what I needed."
4,Nice shave..,I really like using this razor with per shave oil and a nice soap. Use the weight of the razor! Don't press to hard. Let the razor to the shaving. I ordered Derby blades to get used to using a safety razor. Plan to graduate to the Japanese Feather blades when I get better at using this. GREAT FOR A BALD HEAD!
5,Better than the Parker 22R,"This is my 2nd safety razor - theParker 22Rwas my first. This is definitely better. This is lighter, more balanced, and allows for a closer shave than theParker 22R. I paid $27.66 for theParker 22Rand $35.60 for this one. For the small price difference, I would definitely recommend this razor over theParker 22R.Also, the Shark blades are initially sharper thanDerbyblades. So be careful with the Shark blades."
3,The Long Handle makes it easier to use,"I first purchased the short-handled version but thought it was much too short to get a good grip with, so I returned it for this model. The long handle is much easier to hold and use. Works great.Edit: after 21 months the part where it screws in broke off. Iv'e heard these things last decades, but that was clearly not the case."
5,New to the Single Razor?,"I remember watching my dad shave with a safety razor and since have always wanted one. Unfortunately multiblade razors were all that seemed available when I began to shave. Since, I purchased this razor and wont go back."
3,"Sturdy DE razor system,, but not for sensitive faces.","This thing is built like a tank! Once it's in your grip you can tell it's going to last you many years. Unfortunately, the single razor and fixed angle makes shaving unforgiving and time-consuming. In order to get a good shave it would take continual re-heating of my face and multiple passes with the razor. Unless I was moving at a snails pace, I'd get some pretty wicked razor burn. I switched back to a Gillette Mach II Turbo and the difference is night and day. The Mach II gave me a much faster and smoother shave with very little hassle, while shaving with the Merkur Model 180 was like shaving in the dark ages :("
3,On the Fence With It,"First of all, it's a beautiful, heavyweight razor. I had no problem switching to it or figuring it out after switching from a disposable. But the shave was nothing better than my Gillette Custom Plus 3 disposable gave me. In fact, it wasn't as good. I still have it, but never use it. Maybe some day."
5,Best safety razor,Bought this razor to try out safety razor shaving and ill never go back to spending all the money on cartridge shaving. A much better shave and a lot cheaper. I wish I would have done this a lot sooner. This seems like the easiest razor to shave with and it looks good
4,Good razor. Could be a little heavier,"had a parker before with shark blades. i really liked the weight of the parker before dropping it in the shower and it broke. I decided to go with the Merkur based on many of the reviews and so far its been great, but I think its been great because of the Merkur blade that came with it. This blade is awesome; I get a much closer shave then I did with the sharks. Just from a handling and grip perspective I wish it were bit heavier."
2,Good Shave But low Durability,"This razor provided me with a good shave for the 5 months that I had it. To look at it, the razor seems very sturdy, just 3 peaces of metal that screw together. I was quite surprised today when it fell in the shower and broke. The top piece, which screws into the handle, broke. Specifically the screw part fell out. I had assumed this was all one piece, but it appears to be glued together. Overall this razor would be good, but for the money I need something that will last more than 5 months, even if I drop it."
2,"Good shave, but chrome began chipping significantly after 3rd shave","The functionality of this product is fantastic--great clean, close, shave. But, after only 3 uses, the chrome finish began chipping/peeling off revealing a copper (or similar) body. The product appears to be treated with a hot-dipped chrome finish. I did not leave the product in a wet environment and I cleaned it thoroughly after each use. Very happy with Amazon's return policy; I will be trying the Merkur #34 next (the product description states it is Stainless Steel).**Update: I added 2 pictures to the customer images at the top of the page."
5,Go long!,The long handle Merkur is the one to get; it's much easier to control than the standard stubby length.
5,100% Recommended,"All pros, no cons!!! ... not even the ""slow shaving"" comments. No more irritations, uneven shave, or slow shaving... First time I try a safety razor, and I find it very easy, clean and of course safe to use. Bought it along with 2 packs of 100 Derby blades, so no more waste of cash on shavers for a veeeery long time, years indeed!."
4,Best safety razor I've used,"This is my third DE safety razor. The first was pretty cheap (the Retro Razor) and I loved it, but it again was pretty cheap and gummed up. I splurged a bit on my next razor and got a hefty Merkur which I was very happy with. It broke last week. Looking around online I get the impression the breakage was the result of poor cleaning and maintenance on my part (lesson learned, old school shavers--take care of your gear). I got this model as a replacement and so far it delivers the best shave. I wish it had a bit more weight to it, but other than that it is great. Old school shaving rules!"
5,Mekur Safety Razor Review,"The Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor is everything the maker advertises it is; it is very high quality, German made, chromed plated steel, shaves beautifully. I purchased it for my 17 year old son. He had borrowed my Merkur razor which I had purchased over 35 years ago. He noticed it shaved much better than the popular brand disposables. So, I bought him one and he loves it. This razor you will pass to your grandchildren. They are that good. The blades are still available at most drugstores and Walmart, Freds, etc., and they are generally inexpensive; a couple of bucks for a pack of ten."
3,Not for the Head,"I shave my head, and this razor is not ideal for that task at all. on my face its ok, but it takes me a heck of a lot longer than it did with the Fusion I was using before mostly because of the ability for the Fusion to change its angle as you shave whereas this razor has to be held just right... it's a good money savor if you have the time though."
5,wow,I am pissed I shaved for ten years with mach3 razors. This you thing makes shaving enjoyable! Buy one you won't be disappointed!
3,"Cheaper than Gillette or Schick, but not as good","I have been shaving with this about 6 months since switching away from the Gillette Fusion. I made the move because I was increasingly annoyed by absurd razor prices. While it is much much cheaper to shave with a safety razor using normal blades, it is simply not as close a shave. I have coarse hair and the Gillette razor does a better job while letting me shave against the grain, which is the only way I can get a truly smooth shave. This is a lot rougher (cannot go against the grain), but is certainly acceptable for an okay shave."
4,I need help!!,"Hi, i purchased this razor over a year ago. I used it a few times and it worked great. It worked great with the razor blades that came with it. But i ordered additional razors (the ones that amazon paired it up with in the picture) and the additional razors were a little bit smaller, and they really dont work at all!!Can someone please tell me the exact razors i need to get for this model. The ones amazon gave me were too small and they couldnt get close enough to shave anything!!"
1,Oh no.,"I bought this to replace a broken Edwin Jagger DE89, and there's so little space between the blade and guard that I can't get anything even close to approximating a close shave. No good. Replaced with a Parker 92R."
5,New to Safety Razor Craze! No Razor Burn!,"It didnt occur to me that my mach 3 has been giving me razor burn... i figured maybe i wasn't using the right aftershave or maybe drying my skin out too much. I tried different shaving creams, lotions, etc... I realized that it wasn't the lotions... it was the razor irritating me. I did a little research, and read that safety razor are coming back because multiple bladed razors are just too irritating on the skin. So, I decided to pick up this Merkur. I've shaved three times with i, every other day (before I would wait 3-4 days to let the razor burn subside), and it has been nice. Lots of people use shaving brushes and expensive soaps, and maybe I'll go to that later just for the ""experience"", but I've been using regular shaving cream after a hot shower with much success. No razor burn, and a very close shave. Looks like I'm a convert!"
4,Good Starter,"Great for a beginner (like me). Good weight, but it just isn't gentlemanly enough, particularly with the hollow center in the handle. Obviously it was only 30 bucks, but as soon as I used it, I immediately wanted a better razor. This will probably become my back-up.Some people recommend the longer version to help transition from normal cartridge razors (e.g. Mach 3), but I don't think this is a real problem. Just go with a normal length."
4,Good safety razor that's well made,"These razors don't necessarily have a lot to them, but what there is is well made in this case. The razor has an adequate heft to it and the longer handle gives good control on the shave."
5,No more razor bumps,I'm African American with several Caucasian friends. Everyone that has tried DE shaving agrees no more razor bumps. I have no idea why the DE works do well considering I'm putting oil on my face before I shave but it doesn't matter!!! These create the smoothest closet shave ever with no bumps. I'm sold!!!!
4,nice!,can't really review something i don't use since i don't shave my face. My husband has been using this and it's working fine. a good looking serious razor--appears well-made but we've only had it a few weeks. I opted for the longer handle really don't know why.
1,Broken Razor,"I used this razor, taking excellent care of it, over the past year or so. Then one morning, the head broke right off. I am not sure, but I believe a razor that costs this much should have a longer life. I will not be buying any more Merkur products."
5,Best razor ever,"I've used this product for a month and I love it. Every morning I feel like I just came from the barbershop. If you guys are looking for razor blades, I would recommend the ""100 Shark Super Chrome Double Edge Safety Razor Blades"". They are awesome and this is where you will save money. They come 100 blades in a pack and they only cost about $18. I am so happy I bought this product."
4,Good razor,Did what it said it would do.I dont have enough words to justfiy a full 5 star rating however here are some
4,Good First Safety Razor,"This is the first Safety Razor that I purchased, and I'm relatively pleased with the razor. I originally bought it based on a recommendation from The Art of Manliness website regarding wet shaving. Although I do state that the razor is a great first razor, I found it to be quite mild, and decided to change to a more aggressive razor within just a month or two. This would be a great razor for the type of man who's looking to shave on a daily basis without the baby-butt-smooth shave, or for the guy who's not sure whether or not they want to transition to a double-edged safety razor from the multi-bladed razors.Another word of advice for the would-be safety razor shaver: check out YouTube for shaving videos from Geofatboy and Mantic59. These two aficionados make shaving a true art, with tutorials and reviews. I've personally purchased the majority of the products I use personally based off their reviews."
5,OMG,"I made the switch from cartridge razors and am not disappointed at all. get this and the below linked razors and save some money.Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count"
5,My first DE razor,"I guess I don't have much to compare this to seeing as it's my first razor, but, I feel the build quality, the shave, and experience are superb. The razor has a nice weight to it and the knurling helps when your hands are wet. I've been learning my technique and have had a difficult time breaking the habit I had with my disposable razors of pushing down while shaving. It's definitely not recommended with these razors. Overall, great bang for the buck!"
5,Very nice razor,Before purchasing this razor I used merkur vision. I think this one is much easier to use and maintain or clean. Very nice combination with merkur blades. Thumbs up.
5,Nice Razor,"I've used electric razors for most of my adult life, and only recently got introduced to the world of DE shaving.After doing some online research about safety razors, I decided to give Merkur Model 180 a try. Thanks to otherreviewers, I had some idea of what to expect. I have to say that it wasn't until a few weeks of use, that I started to get comfortable with this razor, understanding the finer nuances like the angles of the blade, and the pressure applied for different parts of the face. I, finally, had a shave that was close and without nicks and cuts, and irritation. For me, this is a fine peace of shaving equipment, that won't break the bank!"
4,Enjoy the old fashion way,"Nice finish, comfortable to handle, not so aggressive cutting level. Just pick up the right blade and you'll be satisfied with it."
5,Gentle men only,First off I'm a black male with coarse hair and if you're the same you can relate with hairs growing any and everyway but straight down... I've used a 5 blade razor for a while and this beats it hands down. My engrown hairs have went from many to about 5 per shave which is good considering my hair type. seems like the more I use it the less I get which is a plus.. I would suggest anyone who have the same hair type to purchase along with the art of shaving kit. So if you're looking for a classy and purposeful razor this is it.
4,Great first-timer razor,"Easy to use and the shave is as close and non-irritating as promised. I just wish that there was some indication in the packaging of how to get a blade on/off. For an inexperienced user, it took me about ten minutes of trying to screw the handle off before realizing that it's only the head that needs to be unscrewed. Otherwise, this razor is top-notch."
5,I love the simplicity,"This is such an outstanding product. I have finally jettisoned the disposable junk from Gillette, and I am shaving for a fraction of the cost now thanks to this Merkur razor. The design is so basic and easy to use and keep clean (just three pieces). I am glad I got the longer handled razor as I can't imagine how I would handle the shorter one. I use Wilkinson blades since they are the only decent double edge blades I can purchase locally, and they work great. It takes me no more time to shave with this than it did with my Gillette Mach 3, and yet I get a noticeably closer shave."
3,Back to the Past,I remembered my father using the basic two sided safety razor when I was young and I probably started out using one myself but I really don't remember. I decided to try it again double edge blades are inexpensive when compare to those used in multi blade razors on the market now. I have been using it for about a month now and find it to be very useful. It gets the job done with the only caution being care taken because cuts seem to appear more often. One has to not apply much pressure and the razor works well. This particular brand razor is the only one I have used and it is fine. Cleans easily and blades seem to last a long time.
2,It's made of aluminum,"Unlike some the Merkur 1904, this one is made of aluminum. That may not matter to you, but to me it feels light and cheap. I returned it, and will buy another Merkur 1904 instead."
4,Decent,"Bought this razor in February 2009, for my first ever safety razor. In 2009, I was converting from the Mach3 to wetshaving, so this razor started me on my path.After the 3 years of using it the razor is still in fantastic condition. Holding the razor, the feel of it is wonderful. It's easy to clean and put in new razors.However, I had trouble with ingrown hairs all the time; especially in the neck area. I've switched to a GEM single-edge razor and haven't had the ingrown hair problems (at least so far - 2 months in to the GEM Razor)."
2,The right way to shave,"I received my Merkur #180 2 days ago. Had plenty of growth on my face and decided to shave. By the way, although I had ordered the 10 pack of Merkur blades, the razor actually came with one Merkur Platinum coated blade - that was a pleasant surprise. No cuts, no nicks, I went slow and enjoyed a real shave. This is not a ""butterfly opening"" type of razor. It consists of 3 parts: the top and middle pieces, and the handle. The top and middle pieces fit together in order to sandwich and bend the blade to the correct angle and the handle screws into the top piece . A quality piece of shaving hardware, well worth the money, should last a lifetime or two if not longer. Get one, you'll be glad you did. Also let the wife use it with a fresh blade, she enjoyed it and we'll be getting her a Merkur of her own!UPDATE: Finish is chipping in places which means smooth shaves are a thing of the past for this razor. Started out great but didn't last nearly as long as I had thought it would..."
5,FEMALES!,"I found very few reviews by women using this safety razor. You would think with our beauty routines we would buy a more eco-frenidly and money saving method to shaving. Anyway...I finally used this razor on my legs the other day and it worked great! I was a bit nervous at first, since I heard how one must have a light touch when shaving or you will cut yourself. No problems here- it was a breeze. Definitely would recommend this razor for any gender. Its a perfect fit in my hands and i have no issue with its long handle or weight. SMART BUY!"
3,It's Pretty,The razor does not shave the hair just below your nose. Keep your disposable handy for those hard to reach areas.
2,Not cracked-up to what these ratings say,"I have read all of the wonderful ratings about this razor i.e. how close it shaves, how your face will be baby soft, etc. etc. etc.I have found this razor to be just an ordinary razor, similar to the one I used in the 60s. I followed all the recommendations on how to get a super close shave;I took a hot shower kept my face wet, used a brush with good cream, and still my face is not soft, I can still feel the stubble. I used the fresh blade that came with the razor, and still a less that desirable result. I don't understand how all of these ratings are so great on just a mediocre product, which is way over priced..."
2,"Not bad for a safety razor, but might not be for you","I had used this product for a whole week before I was forced to return it. I was forewarned that your first dozen or so shaves will suck, but I didn't know how much. It was beyond what I was willing to do for a ""closer shave""."
1,Horrible!,I have had this razor for 6 months now. I have tried it 3 times and all 3 times I had the worst shave and nasty cuts. I was very careful but still. I will stick with the modern razors.
5,Solid and good heft,"My first safety razor. Very high materials and manufacturing. Perfect weight for a great shave. I never realized how terrible disposable razors are. Definitely a good investment. I change blades weekly, and wipe excess soap residue when I change the blade to keep the razor shiny and clean."
4,Works perfect,"I am new to safety razors, did some research and found the merkur 180 was popular. Excellent shave (even enjoyable). Trying out different blade brands now."
4,Glad I found out about this,This is a good buy!! You definitely have to take your time and develop a technique. I appear to have less irritation with this razor and double edge blades compared to the 5 blade disposables. Excellent buy in my opinion.
5,Gets lots of use in this household!,"My boyfriend and I both use this razor, it did take him awhile to learn how to shave with it, it is easier to get razor burn with until you learn how to use it. I love it for my legs and everything else. I also had to learn to be more careful but it works great, and there is so much less waste than those plastic disposable ones, not to mention the blades last a lot longer than the disposable ones too."
5,Well made,Never used a double edge before. Once I got use to the proper angle you should use. I loved it. Never had a betater shave.The razor is very well made and I recommend the long handle.
4,Really Great Starter Safety Razor,"I read a lot about using classic methods for shaving (straight blades and safety razors) and kept looking around. Finally I purchased this product and I'm really impressed with it. The long handle has good grip to it and it gives an amazing shave. The only thing I have to comment on is the blade does get clogged easily, so after I finish shaving I have to clean it thoroughly. Otherwise, great product and terrific results!"
5,good razor,"this is a good razor, it gives a close shave and will last you a life time with the propper care."
1,S&H Rip off,"Shipping and Handling costs almost as much as the item. In fact, they charge twice the cheapest UPS or FedEx rate. Suggest you look elsewhere for a lower cost item."
3,To be Used With Caution,"The plug for this converter worked properly in the outlet. However I was not aware of how hot this would make my curling iron and I burned my hair. I left the iron on low setting and I could use it, but still had to be very careful as it still was hot, and I had to cut my hair when I returned home as the ends were burned. This is a product to be used very carefully."
3,"Messy sexy, but scratchy","This is a beautiful bra, but it isn't comfortable to wear for several hours. It would be a wonderful undergarment for a evening that you wanted to ""show it off"", not wear as an everday bra. The price tag was a bit steep for me, but it has a LOT of beautiful detail, so it's probably in line with what an elegant bra should cost."
4,Works well,"The chargers seem to work fine, the wall charger did seem a bit cheap, but it hasn't had any issues. I primarily purchased for the car charger part."
4,"The phone is charging - ergo, it does its job","I use the car charger and gave the home charger to my step-daughter who has the same model phone. My husband has the ""real"" version of the car charger for his phone. What I noticed is that his has a much more secure fit once you put it in. Mine kind of falls out if you move the phone too much - but now that CA is a hands-free state, there's really no reason to move it around so much.There is a very wacky electrical problem with my car. I don't know what caused it yet. I will come back to this review and say whether it was this or not next week after I take it in.UPDATE - Car charger had nothing to do with the electrical problem in my car. The rest of the review still stands."
5,Great Album,"I don't really remember how I became a Naglfar fan, but to say the least, they ROCK!I'm a fan of In Flames, Amon Amarth, Thyrfing, Soilwork, EverEve, etc... and if you like any of those bands, you'll love Naglfar.The raw, yet flowingly smooth guitars & the raspy, growly & echoey vocals all add up to the dark atmosphere that Naglfar will pull you in to.The only thing I don't like about this disc is the fact that it's only 45 minutes long... I NEED MORE!"
2,Dramatically ordinary,"2 1/2With piano and violin instrumentation, I suppose the music isn't as generic as typical ""emo"", but repetitious boredom creeps into a great deal here for me aside for a few genuinely felt segments."
2,tedious,Who would have thought chocolate could become tedious? The fun part of this puzzle was assembling the text clues; the chocolate part was unrewarding and dull. Turn to your favorite chocolate of the edible variety and avoid this disappointing jigsaw puzzle.
1,Not Recommended,"I read a lot of thrillers, and this book is one of the weakest I've read in a while.UPSIDE DOWN isn't badly written, but has significant plot and character problems. The storyline is ridiculous and grows increasingly absurd as the book progresses. It is based on a huge coincidence that would never happen in the real world. The ending was confusing, anti-climactic and unsatisfying. There are too many characters in UPSIDE DOWN and all of them are two-dimensional and uninteresting.There are much better suspense novels out there. Look for books by Michael Connelly, Lee Child, John Sanford, Tess Gerritsen, Greg Isles, and Jan Burke. Unlike UPSIDE DOWN, these novels have compelling characters and interesting plots that actually make sense."
3,Mixed Up,"I've read it, but I don't get it. It left me with more questions than answers. Bad guys that are good guys, for awhile, and good guys that are bad most of the time. I felt like I stepped into an ongoing story and didn't catch up. I don't think I'll rush out to get any more by this author."
5,Weight loss with simplified scientific explanation on how and why we are what we eat,"I had heard of this diet before and am now using it. I know about something of nutrition, but this book is excellent on explaining why we gain as well as maintain the weight we want to loose. The first week I lost 11 pounds, now ending my second and loosing 1/2 a pound a day - but I do stick to the program. I feel great and am looking to completeing my goal! There's nothing like preventative measures to enhance your health and life. Awesome find for anyone wanting to change the way they look and feel."
2,Not really true to the original Dr. Kempner rice diet,"I tried the original rice diet about 25 years ago. It was fantastic and simple. This info in this book looks good but I just don't find it inspiring. I think they are trying to give a more rounded approach. I only use the rice diet in phase one to jump start weight loss, maybe two or three weeks. After that, the recommendations are similar to what all health professionals are recommending: fiber foods, grains, seeds, nuts, fruits/veggies, Omega three fish, low protein, hydration, and lots of consistent exerices, oh and decent suppliments. The recipes look too complicated and one reviewer mentioned expensive. I'm going to stick with the original inspirational one which is very effective, relatively short time to do it, and best of all SIMPLE to follow and prepare. I wish I could find that one and buy it instead of this 'up dated' version."
2,Problems with Kindle version,"I don't know if it's just the Kindle version or not, but there are errors in the most important part of the book-where the specifics of the diet are described. For example, where the details for Phase 2 are given, it's actually Phase 3. I also have the cookbook, and as others have recommended I would purchase only that book as it lays out the diet correctly.As for weight loss, I have lost 8 pounds in 3 weeks, most of that in the first week. The other 2 weeks I have only lost 1 pound each, despite strictly following the diet."
3,Yawn,"It all makes sense, but it is nothing I haven't heard before a million times. I could not get through this book and I definitely could not incorporate most of it's suggestions -- too expensive for one!"
2,Starvation as a Formula for Weight Loss,"Here we go again. Another hocus-pocus cure-all secret recipe to shed thirty pounds in thirty days...by starvation, naturally. Haven't we heard that the human body needs at least 1500 daily calories just to keep a beating heart? The book portrays Mahatma Ghandi as a frugal eater but it doesn't explain that his meager diet of goat's milk and yogurt was politically and religiously motivated. He was a Hindu leader not a dietician and by the time Ghandi passed away he had no teeth left in his mouth. Read ingredient labels, eat often and in moderation, get off the couch, turn off the TV and exercise regularly. That's the secret formula folks, the rest is hogwash.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir"
1,For the Birds,"This is a diet that would be hard to follow and live a normal life, such as eating out, etc."
2,rice diet review,It was a misleading title. I thought it was based on rice at every meal. I was dissappointed I bought the book.
4,The Rice Diet,it was okay but it was not the diet I wanted to do for myself. I always buy the diet books to read in details and then will decide down the road what diet I will use.
1,Don't waste your money,"If you like fruit, vegetables and rice then this diet is for you. It is extremely limited in foods. Phase 1 is about eating only fruit and rice for all 3 meals, 1 week only. Phase 2 is about eating the same except adding vegetables into the plan. It is called the lacto-vegetarian plan. Certainly if you are this person you should do great on this diet, otherwise spend your money somewhere else."
5,Excellent!!!,"I am thoroughly enjoying my new Rice Diet Solutions book. This is a way of Life I can hold on to because not only will I be eating wholesome delicious nutritious food but it helps me physically, spiritually, and mentally as well. This book offers more assurance and details along with the cookbook. I would purchase both for more motivation and cooking tips."
5,A MUST READ FOR SEVERAL REASONS. DIABETES?,"IF YOUR FIGHTING DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, AND WEIGHT CONTROL THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR ALL OF YOUR DIET NEEDS.AS WITH ALL DIETS, EXERCISE AND DRINKING WATER IS RECOMMENDED. HIGH FIBER, NO SALT (LOW) SALT AND IT WORKS..YOU'LL NOTICE THE INCHES GOING BYE BYE, AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER..GREAT READING!"
2,The Rice Diet Solution,"Although I tried this diet for a week and did see significant weight loss of 5 pounds I found it very difficult to follow. I am hypoglycemic and would not advise anyone that is to try this diet as you are not getting enough protein and that is essential if you have low blood sugar. I had to add some protein buy using beans because my sugars were reading low, which was making me feel fatigued and shaky. I also found it hard to follow and felt hungry all the time. If you are hypoglycemic please see your doctor before trying this diet."
2,"good diet, rotten recipes","Yes, I lost weight on the rice diet. I found the first day and week hard, but rewarding. However, when we got to week two, and I began to try their recipes, I was really annoyed. Obviously, the intention was to make food so unappealing that you don't eat it. We tried 5 recipes, not one was worth eating - and it was't my cooking!"
2,Not the most useful diet,"The title of the book seems unrelated the diet plan itself. To me the main emphasis appears to be on eliminating salt from your diet. This is supposed to make the food less appealing, but I think the main thing it will do is keep you from retaining water which will cause you to lose water weight in the first week. I was not impressed."
2,"nice, when it worked","I've had the television for 6 months. Great picture, awesome price. It just decided to die on me one day. I decided to email customer service, instead of call. I've been quoted, yes e-mail is in writing, 2-4 weeks for the part and then someone will call me. Amazingly they didn't have any questions about the issue, so my bet is that Poloroid is well aware of a faulty part. It was great while it lasted; hopefully they will resurrect."
5,The best Stones compilation,"I just love this record - it has the lesser known Stones gems, especially from their psychedelic era, together with then-unreleased early songs. This shows a more mellow side of the Sontes... TLA cinema in the early '70s used to play the second LP between movies, and listening now brings it all back...The sound on this reissue is excellent and natural, I hear details not evident in the LPs I bought when they first came out."
3,screwd up we love you,the mono version on the decca singles collection is the complete version of the song (includes dandelion reprise).the stereo version on more hot rocks does not and has a 1 second voice overlay which is to bad as the stereo version is superior in sound to the mono but when listening to both dandelion and we love you together the missing reprise takes away from listening enjoyment
5,Absolutely essential!,Don't even question the quality of the remastering as it is stellar considering the masters are 30 yrs old. If you are a casual listener and don't own any Stones I recommend you buy More Hot Rocks or 40 Licks as they are both similar and you are sure to hear songs you recognize from radio.If you want to hear some lesser known songs that were popular on the vinyl then buy this as it is fantastic.
3,"""We Love You"" + ""Child of the Moon"" both in stereo","I liked the track listing for _The Singles Collection_ but had to return it upon discovering that the three-disc set went largely for monophonic versions of songs and, in at least a couple of cases, inferior (if once rare) takes. The B-side, ""We Love You,"" in particular, is best heard in its stereo version, where its sound effects are more effectively deployed. Fortunately, I found it and ""Child of the Moon"" both in stereo on _More Hot Rocks_, which, given its overlap with other hits compilations and classic original albums, I nevertheless feel ambivalent about buying. Granted, this collection has other rare songs otherwise uncollected on officially released, remastered CDs, but that material should have been consolidated for release as a separate collection. What we are left with is an overpriced luxury item, from which friends with blank media can pick and choose the worthwhile over the unnecessarily redundant."
5,Listened to this album in high school and is still a great collection of early Stones music,"I'm not as big on later Stones, but love these early songs. Too bad Brian Jones hadn't lived and stayed with the band because I think I like his influence (ala 2000 Light Years From Home). A very good album to have in any serious music listeners collection."
3,strange...,"Very very clever... re-releasing this with 3 Bonus Tracks and still leaving out 'little red rooster'! That song was Number 1 (!!) in the U.K. and is without any doubt the best blues recording the stones ever did, but for some strange reasons it never appears on any stones sampler (apart from the singles-collection and the u.k.-version of 'big hits').Apart from this, 'More Hot Rocks' is a good collection, which has some rarities and some hits as well."
2,Disappointed,Bought this book to take on walks/hikes. The first time out I could not find anything on two out of the first four trees of which I was not familiar!! Very limited coverage of any trees other than those we all know from everyday experience---rather a disappointment!!
5,Small enough to use while backpacking,"I like these small Audubon books because they are light and easy to use. The pictures are clear and the information is easy to read and use. They aren't as detailed as the bigger Audubon books, but then the larger ones are heavier and in a back pack, being light weight is everything."
3,"Good for starters, but...","My husband and i got this book to help identify trees on our walks and hikes. It was nice and small and fit well in the backpack (some 'pocket' books can be thick and heavy), which was nice. However there really are not alot of trees listed and you need to check another soure to find them. The trees that you can identify with the book, are well photographed. It's good for kids and a beginner book, but certainly not complete."
5,Love So Apparent,"A great artist makes his love of Christ real to all who listen. I became a fan after receiving his signature album (""Fernando Ortego"") as a gift, and now buy up whatever he publishes."
4,"Good, but Difficult","I was assigned this text for a History of the Middle East Course, and for the most part this book is very informative. However, this is also its downfall. While traditional histories will focus principally on the geopolitical nature to of the region, the author devotes a great deal of time and attention to cultural achievements. By no means are these unimportant facets of the early Muslim World, but the time spent exploring minor scientific, cultural, or philosophical players made for a difficult text to study. With that minor complaint, this is an excellent, through book on the early Islamic World."
4,Where is the voice of Taiwanese people?,"After I finished the reading of this book I realized that the US-China-Taiwan relation is established fundamentally on the view of Michel Oksenberg. Of course Lieberthal has play an inportant role on the decision making of the State Department.But all the discussion focused on what the PRC thinks and how big will be its economy. Shall these exports ask the following questions?1. CCP is claiming they are the sole leadership of China. Is it legitimate?2. CCP owns the PLA. PLA plays an important role in its regime's decision making. Do you know the agenda of PLA?3. The total GDP of Taiwan ranks 20th in the world. It is just behind Sweden but it exceeds the countries Turkey, Norway, Denmark, Indonesia. Malaysia, Thailand, greece and Portugal. Taiwan is not a ""small"" country. Any country comparing with China is a small country. Where is the view of 23 million Taiwanese in these report?"
3,Not as good as I remember it...,"I had this game as a kid and recently had nostalgia and ordered a NES and some games. Karate Champ is a very basic karate game where knocking down the opponent results in a point. The first one to 2 points wins the next round, and after a few rounds, the difficulty and scenery change. The fight sequences are usually in what appears to be an outdoor setting. Graphics are basic, and there are limited kicks and mobility in general. While it is fun to progress through the levels and play the two-player setting, this game is not one of the best NES games and probably better suited for someone who played the game back in the day (and wants to rehash some memories)."
5,Roady XT kit,The kit was delivered promptly. All items brand new. Works great. We enjoyed our trip to the Oregon coast with the XM radio from my motorcycle plumbed into our car. We used the cassette connection and it works great.Kit also comes with alternate antenna connections.Multiple ways to connect.
3,Could be better quality,"The Roady works fine, tho I preferred XM to Sirus/XM, but my problem is specifically with the car kit. I have been buying one about every 12 months, presumably because the wire from the antenna does not hold up, so the signal reception degrades to the point that my Roady now declares NO SIGNAL about half the time. Not much choice, since I really miss my satellite radio."
5,Fiftynine Years Late the Story is Finally Told,Fiftynine years after the event the amazing story of the exploits of the 51st Engineer Combat Battalion is finally told. This book was written by a member of the 51st ECB and edited by his son. Small elements of the 51st ECB stopped five German divisions for five critical days during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. The unit was later awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their actions. Any serious student of U. S. Army operations in WW II in Europe will find this book rewarding and informative reading. The maps are well deliniated and detailed. The photos tell a great part of of the story and many have never been published before.
1,pesimo libro,"al leer lo que las otras personas han escrito sobre este libro, me da la impresion que tienen un coeficiente intelectual bastante bajo al darle una alta puntuacion a un libro tan malo. solo concuerdo con una de las personas al escribir que el autor trata de descubri el agua azucarada, definitivamente este libro no aporta nada y no me causa duda el rumor que dicen que este libro se volvio famoso ya que su autor auto-compro una gran mayoria de libros. En definitiva mis amigos no malgaste su tiempo y dinero en este libro."
3,disappointing sound quality,Great turn around order time. Everything as advertised from service standpoint. I have an upper end JVC head unit & great sound system - sound on this CD is scratchy/crackly - not near the quality I normally hearventure5858@yahoo.com
1,Very poor sound quality!!!!,"I do not know how anyone could sell this thing...it sounds like she is singing inside of a tunnel, very poor quality. Connie Francis was amazing and all this does it make her sound winey and tinny. Yuk!!"
1,WAKE UP AMERICA,"Reissues of Connie Francis hits are becoming a way of life but please, this is not a reissue of her original hits--it is her Malaco recordings from 1989 of WHERE THE HITS ARE. This too has been reissued to death. There is no end of great Connie Francis material to be released. Amercia look at Japan and South Africa for example. This is as bad as Bush trying to cover up phone tapping. But as I have said before, any Connie Francis product is better than none. How about being a little more original in the future. Take a chance! Her ""Souvenirs"" and ""Italian Collections"" were a bold step for this country and the results were fantastic. They're still in print. So Polydor/Universal get your feet wet, the water isn't that cold. You might be very surprised. We're waiting."
3,Non Fiction,"A university guy looks at mathematically modelling a local sporting event to see if he can beat the odds. He discovers some ineffiencies because of the structure of the game of jai-alai. It is very small stakes betting, but he does come up with something that works.However, being parimutuel, with very small pools, if there were ever two people doing the same thing at the same time it wouldn't work for anyone."
5,Very interesting and entertaining,"This is a fascinating book. It captures exactly the excitement of starting out in programming and working on a project in your spare-time simply because the project seems like a fun, cool thing to write, such as a program for predicting the outcome of football games. Even if you don't come from a mathematics/programming background, I think you'll find the book very interesting. Chapter 4, ""The Impact of the Internet"", alone, is worth the cost of the book."
5,If the subjects of this book interest you then buy it!,"Buy this book! (Disclaimer: I am a friend of the author and he gave me a free copy of this book. He did not solicit a review from me and he does not know that I am writing one, although I guess he will find out sooner or later).I procrastinated in reading this book. It did not sound very exciting. While I have degrees in Computer Science and Business, the title sounded as if the book would be a dense technical treatise on the subject. It was not. I read it in one (long) day.Steve has written a lively book on Jai-Alai, mathematical modeling, probability, statistics, gambling and betting and makes it both interesting and instructive at the same time. I enjoyed reading it and learned a lot at the same time."
1,"Listed incorrectly -- threaded, not slip.","This is not a slip fitting, it is a threaded fitting. See kbico.com for details.The slip version is -S instead of -T."
4,Old school classic!,"Lifeforce, for the Nintendo NES..man, this brings back memories.. even in 2011 this game still is fantastic. it has to be one of the best shooters on the original nintendo...this was when they had AMAZING games on their systems and not the kiddie tripe that the wii is famous for now .. originally known as salmander in japan this version of the classic dosent miss a beat.. this (not that lame mario) was the game that made me want a nes back in the day..after 20 plus years the graphics hold up well (this game looks great on my plasma tv) the gameplay is fast and intense ..and its still HARD.. the kind of hard that makes you throw your controller at the wall..but keeps you coming back for more. rapid fire is a must with this one..its nice to know that the classics stand the test of time.. if you have a nes this is one that you need to add to your collection."
5,"The Mountain shirts are great, my children love them and so do I.",The Mountain shirts are colorful and do not fade. The print is light weight (not thick and heavy) and lasts a very long time. My daughter has one that she has had for four years now (and it was a hand-me down) and it still looks virtually brand new. I am very pleased with the quality and my children are very pleased with the variety and huge selection.
3,At first glance...,"I thought that this shirt was totally uncool. I knew that if I wore this it would ruin all of my chances with the girls that work down at the Arby's, but then I saw the one feature that saved this shirt from getting the one star review...Those are Jesus Horses! They are walking on water which led me to believe that this would be nothing but good luck if I wore it enough.So far...nothing but a yummy roasted smeat sandwich.Ummmm..."
1,NEVER BUY,"NEVER BUY from this company!!!!!!!!!!!!!I was told when I ordered for Christmas this item was IN STOCK and would be delivered.THE 22nd of DEC I was notified by email that my order had been canceled becasue they were ""out of stock.""I have ordered many many things online, but this is the WORST cuctomer service EVER."
1,"""Static Orange"" Is Absolutely -- Static Trash !!!!","How Amazon came up with the ""Country & Western (10 Cd Box Set)"" title for this 2cd set is is nothing short of fraudulent advertising! I paid $20 plus shipping for something that isn't worth two nickels. I couldn't stand even 10 minutes of either cd. ""Static Orange"" is the worst recording I have ever run across. I was mislead by the title and failed to read ""all"" the fine print. I cancelled the order, but not in time. I'm returning this dispicable product to the vender regardless of a refund or not. If ""Static Orange"" is a collectable item, I'm giving the vendor another opportunity to sell it to a worthy sucker. ""Buyer-Beware!"" is no joke. Thank you for reading. Lee J."
1,release the series on dvd instead,"I mean, come on, who cares about a bloody book with condensed bios? Anybody who enjoys this 10-year-old series is going to want to buy dvds of specific shows! I'd like to see the Jan Michael Vincent show, for starters.......Geez."
3,good read,"Even thought I loved the contents of this book I couldn't give it four stars. Why, because of the bad binding job! The information and pictures in this book I found informative but it spoils the enjoyment when the pages keep falling out. I only just brought this book too! Oh, and just so you know the Star Wars Scrapbook is bound the same way!"
4,Great! except.......,This is a great book and very informative. I really enjoyed it. The only problem is that it has the worst binding I've seen on a book...Anywhere! But other than that I really recommend it! Oh and by the way: the Attack of the Clones Scrapbook is bound the same way. That's a good book too.
4,pretty good SW-ATOC book,"Ewan Mcgregor fan? Get this. Has Ewan pics ;) Other than that, your basic SW book. Good purchase though."
5,Best car set for toddlers,We got this as a birthday gift when my baby boy was one. He loved these colorful cars at the first sight. The smaller size of the car is just perfect for young toddlers to grab and handle. These cars are very well made. It has been almost a year now and they still looks like new! My baby has been having so much fun with these cars. I got the construction set too. That is also a great set of cars. Highly recommended for baby shower gifts and baby's birthday gifts!
5,Surprisingly Good Method Book!,"I am a piano teacher, and this is my favorite adult piano method book, because the student/teacher duets are well composed and the accompaniment CD, though not worthy of a listen on its own, features some professional musicians and isn't all artificial instruments."
2,Not for beginners,"Well, it seemed like a good try, but this book isn't for beginners. Thinking Book 1 would be the right place to start, i ordered it. But it assumes you know more than a beginner would know. Even my extremely talented brother-in-law, a pianist by trade, said that it wasn't for beginners. So beware...good book or not, don't order it if that's what you need. Now i need to keep looking...still need a beginner book."
4,Good for absolute beginners,"This book assumes you have no experience reading music whatsoever. Notes are introduced initially without staff lines to get the reader used to associating notes with keys on the piano. Since I have some music experience this approach is not good for me, so I didn't actually use the book. I gave four stars because it seems to be well written, and that it would be good for an absolute beginner. (I am now using Alfred's All-In-One course.)"
3,Not New,"The item was described as being new but was not, there were a few pages missing and the mastering code had been used. Thanks anyway."
3,junk information is packed,"A science text book averagely costs at least 150 USD with over 1000 pages. They all wish to sell as many copies as possible. Therefore, a lot of junk information is packed in which including the easiest concept, for example, a college level Chemistry book packs a ""whole"" chapter talking about ""convert unit""...What happened in our elementary school? To let a 12 year old buy the book, the authors don't talk like a ""nerd"" anymore...USE YOUR Science Language!!! Stop wasting my time! They remove important part from the book and put it to the website for you to BUY the access code so they can make more money. That is how our education is so expensive. This comment is for ALL Science text books."
4,Great,Great book. It's helping me a lot going through my A&P class. I recommend it to all Nursing/Health Care students.
4,good detail,this book has good detail and explainations to help you understand the A&P if your teacher isnt good. helps me out in college!
3,"Great book, bad shape","I got this book for my Anatomy Physio Class... I love the book, I just didn't love that after 2 weeks of using it, all the pages starting coming out of the binding... Now I have a travel size book, where I will just take the chunk of pages with me to school since its all falling apart... I got a good price on it, but now I need to take it to a bookstore and see if they can rebind all the pages so I can use this as a reference book later on...I could tell that someone had recently rebound it, so the effort was there, I think they just didn't do a very good job of it( I bought the book used, for a book its great and I def recommend it)"
4,Great find,This lab manual was in the exact conditions as stated by the sellers discription. I received my book within the time expected with no problems. Thank you!
4,Excellent,Book was descrbed well and in actual condition. Saved over cost of purchasing new. Very pleased with overall transaction
4,Salt Water is not for me!,This book was a cheap investment to find out a salt water tank is not for me. It has great details to help make wise decisions about what is needed in time and money.
2,Basic only book,This book is NOT a complete pet owner's manual. It's content is limited and was not that much help.
5,Wonderful deck!,"This was my first deck and it is not really easy to read wen you first pick it up. It soon began to work for me very well, loves Love triangles! Good as second deck for beginners."
3,Live and Let Die,"Fans of the 007 film Live and Let Die, will recognize these cards, as they were created for that film. The cards themselves have very little imagery to draw conclusions from, but some people I know find them very powerful. But overall, this deck has little to do with ""witches"" in fact it was first marketing under the name ""James Bond 007 Tarot Deck"" and was part of the ""James Bond 007 Tarot Game"". I suspect after the movie became dated, the company repackaged this as a tool of the coven."
2,ugly,"I bought this deck by mistake. When I opened it,I found the ugliest deck ever. Except for the bold colors this deck has no redeeming qualities for me. I recommend this deck for anyone into strange and unusual art, however, I personally couldn't give a reading with it. I gave it to a friend who appreciated the deck's ""Looking Glass"" qualities, and she's had great success. Definately a deck you should try to preview before buying."
4,It' a really great deck,"I gave mine to a Friend, Then I had to replace it as soon as possible. It has personality."
2,Disappointment,"When I ordered this, I thought it would be just Marian Mcpartland. Instead, it also included music by Bill Evans and verbal chatter by the two artists between selections."
5,Bill Evans education,"I was never a big Bill Evans fan but after listening to this informative broadcast, I learned alot about what Bill Evans is all about. I can now really appreciate his playing having a deeper undersatnding of what he's doing...Thanks Marion!"
4,Jersey Devil Myth,Thirteen different stories set over 200+ years. Very informative book. Good wirting and stories. Perfect for anyone new to the Jersey Devil myth and enough twists and new facts for the hardcore fan. ****
1,Convoluted confusion,"I'm very disappointed in this book. It gives several ways to do one thing and they don't work. It leaves out information and is unclear. I knew Flash 4 before I started, but was unable to follow this. I would not recommend this book."
3,what a cute suit,"I ordered my 12month old son this in 18month size. I'm happy that it is shorts because he has to be in an outdoor wedding however I'm not thrilled with the shirt. I think that it's cut weird. It's difficult to keep it looking right in the front because there is only three buttons and it's difficult to keep tucked in. I also had trouble getting the bow tie to look right. I did order a size up because he wears 18month in some brands and I'm hoping it still fits in 3 weeks when he has to wear it. The neck almost seems a little tight and the pants may be a little snug on him. However, it is very cute and was shipped very quickly."
2,Sizing is a bit of!,"I ordered this for my son to wear to my brother's wedding but I was terribly disappointed when I tried it on him. I ordered a bigger size to make sure it fit--even if it was a little big. My son wears 6-9 month clothing so I ordered a 12 month. The shorts (with attached suspenders and cummerbund) were VERY big but the button-down shirt was so small, I couldn't even button it all the way. :-("
4,Superstars take a back seat to a genius,"Considering that Cedell Davis is confined to a wheelchair and has limited use of his arms and hands, due to childhood polio, makes him and his music even more incredible. Using a common butter knife and playing left-handed, Cedell creates a slide guitar sound like no other blues guitarist. The uneven pressure of the knife against the fretboard creates a sometimes haunting metallic whine, that for a moment seems out of tune, but at the same time melodic. There's really no words to describe this.The ""superstars"" behind CeDell stay behind CeDell, Oh, did I mention the man can sing the blues with the best of them? His gruff vocals are just as enigmatic as his guitar playing. Rough and smooth, howling and melodic, his voice is the perfect accompaniment to his guitar, and both link CeDell to the early Delta blues of his native Mississippi.If you're looking for something unsual and special in blues music, this is it."
5,Strategic Collaboration in a nutshell,"In the legal field there is a type of book called a ""Nutshell"" which is something like Cliff's Notes for a legal area (Contracts, Real Property, etc)This book is Enterprise Collaboration in a Nutshell. If you've been in the field for a while, you may not learn anything directly (although you probably will). What you will get is a clarity of focus about dealing with collaboration in a competitive enterprise space. As I read the book, I found little bits and pieces of knowledge that I've personally picked up over the years, but laid out in a thoughtful, organized manner that makes approaching the idea of strategic collaboration much more straightforwardThe authors write in an easygoing, conversational voice, and I enjoyed reading the book.If you're in the collaborative space, this book is a must read."
5,Its a board. You cut on it.,"I put food on it. Then I cut the food and its now in smaller pieces and then its easier to eat.The board itself doesn't seem to scratch at all, cleans easily and is a nice size.One downside, since its so hard it doesn't absorb any water so it can be slippery but hey, its a piece of wood on a countertop, be careful! Especially if you are using it with knives.Be careful around knives, they hurt.Is a good board. 10/10, would buy again."
5,Great cutting board,"This is a very well crafted cutting board, it is very big, sturdy and the rubber grips are firmly in place and stopthe board from sliding around. The only negative is that, since the board is so large, it you are pounding in the center it makes quite a racket since there is so much hollow space underneith. If you are tenderizing meat you might want to use anotehr board (or just flip it over so that it rests completely on the counter. But for all other purposes it is a great board. Have had it for 6 months now and highly recommend it."
4,Kick ass cutting board,"This cutting board is great. It is a good size and a good price. I primarily use it for my homemade pizza. The rubber feet on the bottom are awesome for keeping it in place when I'm kneading pizza dough and it's a big enough work area. Make sure to rub it down with some mineral oil, you can get it at any drugstore, I got mine at target, they sell it as a laxative. I used some paper towels to rub the mineral oil in, this will help protect it from absorbing liquids. Re-do this every 50 times you use it, maybe once a year."
1,Crap,"It showed up with a huge crack running down the face of the cutting board. Poor quality, I'd give negative stars if I could... Do not purchase"
1,Cracked within one week,"Board looks good, but within the first week, it started cracking where the boards are connected. For the record, it was never left in water or anything like that. If anything, I treated it very gently. Very disappointed."
4,Solid cutting board,Good finish and reasonably sized. Might be too big for a studio apartment kitchen but for a 1 bedroom is a perfect size.
1,Cracked in one month,My large gripperwood board developed two large cracks in the wood in only one month of use. The board was never soaked in water and I even used lemon oil on the board to prevent this issue. I will be returning it.
1,just so you know,"Pass on this product.....I bought this for my wife for her birthday on Oct 6. The board arrived promptly and good condition...kudos for amazon. The appearance was like I expected and she was excited. We used the board a few times for steak, chicken, a turkey and it worked fine.Hand washed. Split within the month. Crud. The old adage of ""you get what you pay for"" certainly is applicable here. Now I have to buy another one. I will certainly pay up to get quality that will last."
2,worked fine but cracked in a month,"I loved this cutting board when I first received it. It was huge and the groove kept meat drippings out of the way. I treated it with wood oil before using it and it worked very well.The disappointment came after a month when I noticed a large crack in the board, on the side. I do not know when the crack formed, but I did not drop or otherwise abuse this board. I can only chalk it up to a material defect in the product.At least it's still useable as a cutting board, but the juices leak out of the crack. Overall, it's a disappointment."
3,"OK for the price, but not particularly well made.","I have another Gripperwood cutting board, bought in a store years ago, that is still great and I am very happy with.The two I just purchased seem to have significantly degraded in quality.The wood seems hard and ok, the rubber pieces on the back are just great so the board does not move. But the wood surface all around could have been finished better. The individual pieces of wood that the board is made of are still visible and the groove for the juices still shows the coarse pattern of machining... Not as well made as my old board.The 16x20 board has the course groove menitoned above, the 11x14 board has a visible and noticable gap on the surface where the individual wood pieces of the board mate together.For both boards, some finishing of the surface would have made them great. I may have to do that myself now...OK for the price I guess, but still a bit disappointing."
4,Hardwood cutting board,"This is a reasonably priced cutting board. It has rubber bottom corners which are firmly attached to the bottom and prevent the board from sliding on the countertop.It is constructed by gluing two parralel boards together and mine has a slight separation near one end were the glue has not adhered completely. If it startts to come apart I may have to reglue the boards, which would be easier than sending it back for a replacement."
5,Excellent Cutting Board from Amazon,I really like this cutting Board. The countertop grippers underneath keep it from sliding or moving as you use it. I really like the larger size I was tired of skimpy Cutting Boards. I highly recommend this for anyone who prepares a lot of Vegetables and Salads. My son is a Professional Chef and he commented on how well it fills the need of a Sous Chef.
4,Good quality cutting board,"Large hardwood cutting board, a few rough spots in the grove around the edges but not really a big deal. Board is smooth and I like the feet to keep the board from sliding."
3,Indian crossover music,"This is easy listening Indian fusion. It's soemthing to put on in the background and groove to, not something that really grabs your attention. I expected something a bit more special, particularly as it is called 'Sacred temples of India'. Also, Manesh Vyas is one of the musicians and his work is generally fantastic. But unfortunately little of his genius shows through here. There is a smoothness to the music and a nice gentle rhythm, but nothing that transports us into the 'sacred'."
5,On of the best CD ever,"I have this CD since 2006, and it remaines one of my favoret. All musical compositions have a high spiritual, uplifting influence on me. I would highly recommended to purchase the CD to enyone, espasially for Yoga practitioners."
5,Las Ninas Rock!!,"received this as a gift...my favorite song is ya me siento mejo...and menos ropa and super women are cool too..but my absolute favorite at the moment is ya me siento mejo....I really had a bad day today--listening to the song with the lyrics I saw you fight or I want to see you fight....made me laugh....listening to las ninas made me feel better.....I'm a junior spanish student too....and if there's anything I love it's spanish and hip/hop, rap, and R&B and a perfect paradise would be to mix my two favorite loves together....Las Ninas Rock!! Estupendo! Mas Buenas! Me encanta Las Ninas!!!"
2,BAD,"I LOVE ""Oju"" but the other songs are not nearly as good. This album is a major dissapointment. I don't understand the hype about this trio here in Spain."
4,Truly everbody falls down sometime,"This CD is very spiritual and uplifting. Just the words themselves really put one in a state of acceptance of their mistakes, and yet at the same it allows you to forgive others. I respect Erik and anyone else that had anything to do with this composition. Great job! Hope more CD's are coming soon."
4,Great reference material,"I attended Kent Crawford's seminar on the Strategic Office several years ago and enjoyed it tremendously. Kent knows his stuff and uses facilitation techniques in the seminar to generate the sharing of ideas from all participants, which makes the seminar so valuable. This book is given as reference material for the seminar. In fact, I have not read the book entirely, but use it more as a reference material, and now that I am browsing through it again it makes me want to read it entirely!What I used from this book: the Project Management Maturity Model (so far still the most pragmatic model I have seen), the project management templates at the end of the book, the questionnaire for capturing lessons learned, and sample issues identification list.This book is focused on the organizational aspects and gives sound advice, but is not detailed at how to implement a generic PMO since it assumes that each organization is really different."
2,telenovela film,"With its overacting and over-staged performances, this may have been a movie-length work, but it still resembled a telenovela.With its airport sequences, this film attempts to riff off of Almadovar's ""Women on the Verge,"" but fails. It also tries to deal with post-911 life. However, Spike Lee's ""25th Hour"" beats this work with a bat.The most interesting sequences of the trilogy involved a married man with a boyfriend. Do you remember in ""Human Nature"" when Madonna asks, ""Would you like me better if I were?"" This storyline ends however viewers want to see it as. This is just like in the French film ""Cafe au Lait"" when one doesn't find out who is the biological father.This disc starts with movie previews that you cannot skip over. Worse, they have no English subtitles and English monoglots will be lost and bored during them."
4,Compelling tragedy is a page-turner,"Although not a sports fan, I was unable to put down the book. Even though it is cleathr from the start what will happen to Bill, the author manages to keep the dramatic tension alive so that the reader keeps hoping for a different ending."
1,Don't bother to read this stinker,"Wow. What a huge disappointment. Johnson is a sorry has-been,and author Woodlief is amateurish at best. Do yourself a favor and watch the Olympics on TV and pass on this book which I felt was a big waste of time - I couldn't even bother to finish it."
2,"Nothing special, just OK","With the winter Olympics right around the corner, I thought this might be an interesting and timely book. But it's much more about bad boy Johnson's personality and not enough about the sport of skiing. The author tried too hard to encompass too much and as a result, the whole book suffers. It's just OK."
2,Disappointing read,"Initially, I found the subject matter of this book quite interesting. However, it is clear that Woodlief is a novice writer. In trying to make something new out of an old story (rebellious young man tries to overcome dysfunctional childhood with tragic results),the story does not flow smoothly. The lack of chronological order in Johnson's life, and attempts at ""artsy"" flashbacks make this book unnecessarily confusing for the reader. I would not recommend this book."
3,Will and Grace: The complete Series,"It was all great till I got to season 7 two of the disks just skipped and would not play at all... Otherwise, it was all good...sad...Now I will have to buy season 7 by itself to have the whole series."
3,little let down,"don't get me wrong, i think amazon has great products for great prices- but after watching some of my will and grace i noticed a lot of episodes would skip.NOT COOL, right?"
3,Disappointed,"Several of the disks don't play well. They skip, freeze or just won't play. I'm thinking of returning the whole set."
1,Poor Mastering,"I bought this compilation for my wife for Christmas. Unfortunately some of the reviews on this product were correct -- I should have listened.These disks were not mastered to play correctly on most DVD players. We have 6 DVD Players in the house, and these disks will (sometimes) play correctly on ONE of them (the PS3). This is unacceptable by any standard.Do not buy this compilation."
2,Discs not all playable,"The show is great. The discs are not. About 1 episode on almost every disc either won't play or skips and stutters. I've tried the discs in 3 different players, so it is definitely the discs. However, it was more than 30 days before I sat down and started watching them, so I'm not able to return them now. Sucks for me.Also, the package they come in has each disc in a thick tight paper holder which will likely create scratches on the discs when inserting/removing them. Assuming your discs are in good condition when you get them, you'll want to buy a separate DVD holder to store all of the discs.My advice, upon getting your discs, go through at least every disc on the 1st season, and fast forward 5-6 minutes into every show, to make sure they play. Then you'll find out if they're bad soon enough to return them."
1,Product Defective--Twice!,"Some discs in the first set we ordered were defective--skipping, pixelating, sometimes grinding to a halt. This set was exchanged quickly and without expense on our part by Amazon. The second set also contained discs with the exact same defects. Upon attempting an online return of the second set we discovered that the return time window had closed and read that no return would be allowed. There are 33 discs in this set and it is highly unlikely that one would encounter a defect in, say, disc 30 within the allowed return period. We called Amazon, pointed this fact out, and were granted a full refund on the second set (but watch your credit card statement--only a partial refund was credited until we called customer service to follow up). We would strongly discourage anyone from ordering this set until Amazon states specifically that the defective product has been removed from their stock."
1,Don't waste your money,"Like several others I found that many disks were defective, episodes skip, and in some cases make noise in the DVD player. The disks seem to be thinner than a normal disk. Anyway quality did not seem to be high on NBC's agenda for this product so save your dollars, I wish I did."
2,Production Problems!!!,"I would recommend NOT buying this set from anywhere, because my original purchase had multiple discs issues of not even loading the material at all. When I received my replacement set, many of the same discs still did not work, so it is clearly a production issue that NBC Studios should look into but as far as I know, nothing has been done. In addition these aren't the complete episodes, they are syndicated versions. I rated it 2 stars because the box itself is pretty awesome. Hopefully they'll re-issue this set or at least fix the disc problems."
1,DVDs Defective,This is one of my favourite series'. I would've given this 5 stars except for the fact that several of the dvds are defective. Episodes keep skipping so much that sometimes I can't even see more than a half or a third of an episode. I spent so much money on this and it feels like a con - like I bought bootleg or something.
1,Waiting for re-release too!,"I am going to wait til they re-release this box set also. I really would love to own the complete series - but would ideally like it to be complete and on BLU-RAY!!! After reading comments on here, it doesn't sound worth it to me to buy this box set!!"
1,Dvds are flawed,"Some DVDs will not play episodes. I checked the DVD for scratches and/or damage, there was none. If I use the ""play all"" option it skips over episodes. If I pick the individual option it boots me back to the main menu. I only made it to the second disk in the series, but will check the rest. I noticed this was an issue for other people, but I thought they resolved the problem. Guess I was wrong!Update: I only made it through the first season. Disk #2 won't play the forth episode. Disk #3 skips during episodes. Disk #4 skips and will not play the last two episodes. The final DVD in the first season will not play at all. I gave up after so many issues with just the first season and send the box set back to Amazon. I'm going to wait until they re-release to purchase again."
2,Defective discs,"Bought this set new on sale at Bestbuy. These are the fussiest discs ever. None of my players have ever rejected a disc before, not even the most suspicious rentals so I know it's not my equipment. So far they will all play, but no 2 are the same in their quirks. I thought some discs wouldn't play at all since they wouldn't work in my blu-ray player, but they would play OK on the PCs. Some will play fine in the Blu-ray player but only IF I fool with going to the disc menu and ""Play all"" from there. Some will only play from ""Play all"" and not individual episodes from the list. Some discs freeze on the opening menu but will play if I hit ""disc menu"" on the remote. The most consistency I had was on computers.I only paid $30 so I can't complain too much. I'd advise only buying this set IF it is on sale, and you have some flexibility as to where you watch them. If a computer isn't an option, think twice."
5,Edited Review,"I have the WG ""complete"" series. So far, I'm into the 3rd season and loving every minute of it. I marked which disk each episode was on in the guide, and that's when I saw so many missing storylines. It turns out that none of the episodes was missing. I did not realize that in season 3 WG started having 2 menus. I was missing the last 3 episodes on each disk. I went back today and checked off each episode in the guide. They were all there. I still rank this as a 5-star performance set. This is exceptionally smart comedy and I recommend it anyone who really likes clever dialogue. Buy and enjoy."
1,Beware of Defective Products from Amazon.com,"I ordered this DVD series set on March 6, 2009 and when it arrived, I found that several of the discs would skip episodes and that the quality of other episodes were very choppy and pixilated. I returned the original set to amazon.com with a prepaid label from UPS, only to receive a replacement set that had the same problems. A representative from amazon.com stated that the series would be rendered unavailable to order until it was determined whether or not amazon.com had received a bad lot of the Will & Grace series. Upon observing the site since my correspondence with representatives from amazon.com, I see that that has not happened. All I can say to any potential buyers is BEWARE!!"
1,disappointed,"ready to buy this along with some other complete sets, but it seems the consensus is that this is SO EDITED that it is NOT the complete series... so i am NOT going to buy it until it's available UNCUT!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I did not read the reviews before purchase and wish I had. Horrible product! Every episode has a skip or stall issue and the second half of each disc had not been recorded. Plus one of the reasons I wanted to get the DVDs was to get the super-sized versions on the original run. These are the versions edited for syndication. Amazon.com should pull this product from their inventory. I would've given it 0 stars but could not submit. The only positive to this was how easy the return process was.
1,HORRIBLE!!,"I buy from amazon all the time, and I've never been so disappointed!! I guess I really should have read the reviews before I ordered it. The shows freeze, and I can't even watch an individual episode. Each disc has to play in full, and the freezing starts during the 3rd or 4th show on each disc. So the viewer actually can't even watch about half the episodes. This will definitely be returned!"
2,To purchase or not to purchase.......????,"I love Will & Grace..........I haven't bought this WG collection. Based on the current review report, I don't think I can buy this product as almost every other buyer is complaining of non-working of the DVDs.How can i buy this product when there are so many bad reviews about the quality of the product?Can anyone reply why should I buy this product?"
1,Horrible experience,"DO NOT ABSOLUTELY NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM. I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS SET WHEN I GOT IT. THIS IS MY FAVORITE SITCOM OF ALL TIME. AND WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND OUT THAT THE DVDS SKIPPED A LOT. NOT SCRATCHED OR DIRTY, MY DVD PLAYER IS IN TIP TOP SHAPE. EXCHANGED ONCE AND RETURNING THE ITEM AND GOING WITH A DIFFERENT SET. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT SINCE THIS ITEM IS PACKAGED VERY NICELY AND LOOKS GOOD ON MY DVD SHELF."
1,Looks Great -- DVD's skip/stutter/don't work,"I love this show, however, the DVD's are extremely poor quality. I watched the first 3 seasons, and every single disc had multiple issues with skipping, stuttering, or completely freezing up.I tried them in my home theater system, my laptop, and my xBox. Identical timing/placement of the skipping.I returned the item, and got a replacement, however, the same issue is still occurring.Do NOT buy this if you actually plan on watching the show. If you just want a box on the shelf, then it looks great!"
1,Just Awful!,"Each season in this boxed set has numerous defective disks. Some freeze, some won't play at all. Very disappointing and frustrating. Amazon customer service was exceptional, however, and allowed the return of this defective product even after the 30-day refund period. Since then, I have ordered the ""Will and Grace 1-8 Seasons Bundle Pack"" from one of their independent vendors and am extremely pleased with the service and, more importantly, the quality of the dvds. The individual seasons just take up more room on the shelf ... small price to pay for having the shows play smoothly!"
1,Extremely irritated & dissappointed,"I purchased this and couldn't wait to receive it however, at least two episodes on each disc would skip and were impossible to watch...very frustrating! There's really no point in watching if I can't watch all of them so I sent the whole set back, now I'll try to find a different one somewhere else. Do not buy this set!"
1,DVDs were damaged,"I watched only Season 1 and half season 2, every single DVD was freezing picture in the middle of DVD and will not allow you to watch further. Very frustrating."
1,Horrible don't buy this set!,"Purchased this set as a gift for a friend. More than half of the DVDs will not play! Total waste of money. The DVDs skip, pause and will not move forward, or just flat out will not play. I have tried to play them in a DVD player, computer and even an XBox 360. They are completely worthless. So disappointed! Do not waste your money. I could not get the company that made them to replace them."
1,Disgusting scam,"NBC should be ashamed of themselves. As EVERYONE has written, the whole set of DVDs is defective. Every single one of mine is defective. They are obviously cheaply made and poorly produced. If I didn't know better I would think they were bootleg or knock offs. If I could have given zero stars, I would have. There are also lots of cuts in the episodes ( the few that actually partially played). I hope NBC brings out a real complete boxed set , despite being burned by this I would still like to own a quality set."
3,Will & Grace: The Complete Series,"I love the TV series but this product is the pits. Once you remove the discs from the packaging they do NOT go back in easily. Season two is full of defective discs, I was only able to watch 3 episodes all the way through. there are a couple of defects in other seasons but the episodes are watchable. I purchased S2 separately, I hope that it'll be of a better quality."
1,Hilarious but damaged...twice,"I have loved owning Will & Grace from the standpoint of how amazing of a show it is. But, unfortunately, I ordered this item and nearly every disc skipped. Amazon very graciously sent a new box out for free but the second box set ALSO skips. I am very upset with the manufacturer of this product because they seem to be the cause of the problems (again, Amazon has been amazing). Additionally, I have seen on other sites that the discs of the box set also skip. Do I recommend Will & Grace as a show to watch? DEFINITELY! Do I recommend buying the box set? Unfortunately no due to the damage on these discs."
1,Disappointed,1/3 of the discs are damaged and can't be watched. I am only through seasons 1-5 at this point. How do I get a replacement?
5,great item! fast shipping!! A++++,Amazon is a very legit and dependable website! It has amazingly fast shipping! Items are in perfect condition!!
3,ok buy,"Most of the discs contained in the series seem to be working properly, however, there is about two discs so far that skip over what seem to be damaged areas. Other than that, the series is complete and in good used shape."
5,I love this sitcom!!,You can complain all you want if you don't like this show but I loved it. It was groundbreaking in many ways. It made me laugh and cry and I enjoyed it immensely. I will enjoy my new collectors set when it arrives.
1,Approach with caution,"Will and Grace: The Complete SeriesAlthough it is exciting to see this finally appear in a box set, I wonder if it is the same edition which came out in the UK some time ago? I was going to order it as it promised many extras, but I then saw a couple of warnings from other buyers saying that many of the episodes had had various lines cut in order for the set to be given a general viewing certificate. For me this would ruin my enjoyment of the series, and would of course nullify the set as being 'complete'. Does anyone know any more before we place our orders?"
1,Great Series - Terrible DVD's,I'd like to echo many of the other reviews about the quality of the discs. Every disc had scratches or defects making some of the episodes completely unplayable and other episodes full of hangs/skips. This was in all of our DVD players even after cleaning the discs. This great series deserves a better quality product.
1,BAD quality DVD's from amazon,"I bought this complete series from amazon.com brand new. About half of the DVD's jam and will not play. Very hard to get completely through an entire episode on several disks. I tried on another DVD player as well--same thing. Very surprising since these were brand new in factory wrap. If you order, keep the box and return label until you test out the DVD's."
2,skips,bought this for my sister for christmas who had the biggest smile on her face... only to find out many of the discs skip and look scratched. Do not do it you or the person your giving it to will be very disappointed.
1,DVDs dont play,"Hi, I bought the Will and Grace complete series pack. Every single DVD I have watched so far gets stuck and my player cannot read the disk. I have tried 3 different DVD players and have the same problem. I end up missing atleast 2 episodes on every DVD. I bought a new product, the collection is not used... DVDs do not have any scratches.Please be careful when buying this product. You might miss atleast 6 episodes in each season !!!!"
1,Wilt & Gnash - Argh!,"I refuse to pay for cable or satellite. The prices are ridiculous! So, I ordered one of my favorite show's complete series, ""Will & Grace"". I was so happy...af first. Everything about the packaging, presentation and graphics indicates that this is a genuine NBC original series dvd set. HOWEVER, over half of the episodes DO NOT play on my Sony or Samsung Bluray players. SO DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Dont Bother,I have now returned 2 of these sets because they will not play... 3rd is on it's way and I do not hold out much hope that they will play either. Such a wonderful show with the worst manufacturing defects I have ever seen.
1,Unplayable discs,"Some discs do not play all episodes. Surface looks okay in regular lighting, but brighter light reveals multiple scratches on these discs."
4,The Fire Pony a Round-up Delight For Seasonal Riders,"The Fire Pony a round-up delight is about two boys Roy and Joe who end up at the Bar None after Joe breaks Roy out of Day Care. They were allowed to stay if Joe shoed the toughest horse. Joe did that! Later Mr. Jessup gave Roy a pony. Roy named the pony Lady Luck. A terrible storm sets in and a sabertooth cuts Lady Luck. When she is healed Roy was trained to ride, Mr. Jessup and Roy go to the fair. Roy wins the first race, but then in the second race there's a problem. Joe comes to Roy's defense after Mullens sabotages the race. This book has taught me never get back at others or a price will come. Read this book to find out what happens at the race and the price Joe will pay."
5,Interesting and adventurous!,"I really enjoyed this book. I read it in a few days. Roy and his brother, Joe Dilly, make their home on the Bar None Ranch and Roy gets very interested in horses and ponies, especially Lady Luck, his beloved pony. If you haven't read it, check it out from the library! Philbrick also wrote Freak the Mighty, an awesome book, too! I recommend these two books for anybody who loves adventure and unlikely friendships!"
3,"Pretty good, but a lousy beginning.","I am a pessimist to the death, If a book is good by most standards, it's okay by mine. I considered this book decent but the beginning was somewhat boring. The ending was cool though, Rather cool description of a horse race and horse fever. Other than that, this book is just AVERAGE."
5,A Classic,"I think this is an awesome game! You get to choose out of three possible ""roles."" Fighter, Saint, or Magican, Each has their own unique aspects, i.e fighter equals a bigger sword than magican or saint.You find out that your memory was lost but now you have to go fight this evil guy to rescue your princess, Scheherazad. You have several worlds that you need to get through. I myself only got to world two and I wish that there was more materials out there so that I can complete this fantastic game. I can't believe that it wasn't a huge hit.The only annoying thing about this game is typing in the password to get to the world that you saved.I know this review really didn't overly help you at all, but atleast it's about the game."
4,A Great Generic Sci-Fi Game Setting,"Many of my favorite sci-fi military settings books can be played using the Traveller Setting: Serrano Legacy, The Lost Fleet, Honorverse, etc.No other book makes my job easier and more fun than having the tool kit provided by GURPS Traveller: Interstellar Wars. Simplify it, Complicate it, everything you may need you have at your finger tips with this book.Along with GURPS High Tech and Ultra Tech, are a great combination but not necessary."
3,An Excellet Tool,"Overall this is a fine tool. I didn't buy it for the campaign setting material but rather for the other non-campaign specific stuff. Now unfortunately that's only about 1/3 to 1/2 of the book but I knew that going in.I do have to say though that I think the ease-of-use of GURPS books has gone down as the 'BLING' has gone up. Full color, glossy pages and the like are all nice but leaving out important tables and things like that (or the rules-free GURPS Space book which is all bling and no rules) is a bad direcetion to go."
1,is that the right price?,"How does this book cost $800? Someone please explain. Unless each page is made of Kevlar and then gold plated, I can't figure this one out."
5,"Beneath a Blue Umbrella, a melon seller sat.","This was my cousin's favorite book as a child. Jack Prelutsky did a good job of it. Even though the book is about as long as a novel, my baby cousin (now nine and a half) sat through the whole book. When she got up to Anna Banana, she would hold her hands up in the air like she was walking on them. The poems, (some based on familiar nursery rhymes) others totally original, are still staples around our household. I would reccomend it to any child. --Robert Metz"
2,My son doesn't enjoy it.,"Bought this because my 18-month old son LOVES ""The Frogs Wore Red Suspenders"" by the same author. But this book doesn't have the same charm. The poems aren't as good. And it's a different illustrator, whose pictures don't seem to grab my son the way the ""Frog"" book does. When I start reading this book to my son, he tries to squirm away or just looks bored. When I take out the ""Frog"" book, his eyes light up and he gets all excited and claps and can't wait for me to start reading."
5,Masterpiece,"Spinetta as his best. Right after Almendra and Pescado Rabioso, reaching even higher levels with Invisible. Duranzno Sangrando is perhaps one of his best songs ever."
1,7 Deadly Design Flaws,"Saw the AVGN's review of this, and played it out of curiosity. The game is just simply badly designed; controls are VERY stiff compared to say Contra, the Mario trilogy, Mega Man or the TMNT games. Ever level has very awkward design, such as when jumping up to a certain height, the screen constantly has to jolt up and down to orient itself, and it makes you wanna puke sometimes; it happens VERY frequently. Trying to jump on enemies while this is happening is very confusing and disorienting for you.Just watch AVGN's review on this (discretion; has LOTS of strong swearing but it's funny). It might've been fun, but the clunky level designs and stiff controls make it a very frustrating experience."
3,Not Kool,"This game isn't AWFUL, I've played worse games, like the 3 Stooges, or any LJN game. It's cool for nostalgia, but if you want a really good game not many people have heard of, try Metalstorm, Abadox, and many great Famicom games."
4,10 minute Abs,"This video is a great introduction to working towards a washboard stomach. It is relatively easy to do, and therefore easy to do every day"
4,Golden Sun: A fun game that took me 1 month to bet.,The battle mode is awsome. I spend most of my time battling to raise my ally's level. The puzzles are very boring and hard.
3,Looks great but not my thing,"Don't get me wrong. I love RPGs and building up custom characters but I don't like them in the 2D world of the GBA. On the PC I have played awesome games like Dungeon Siege, where the RPG element is at it's best but I found Golden Sun to be really slow.It took ages to get going and there is an unbelievable amount of dialogue in it. But there is no way to skip past it. You will literally be sitting there hitting the button for 10 minutes reading bland word bubbles. Some have given this game a great review but I'm afraid this RPG just didn't do anything for me and I won't be checking out the sequel.Graphics ASound A-Gameplay C-Lasting Appeal C-"
2,Don't let them fool you!,"Earlier, I wrote a review saying this game was excellent. I am writing this to take it back. This game has no depth to it whatsoever, and is made so that no matter what you do, it is exactly the same. You have no options, except for buying things.You have to go everywhere in order because you have to get something from one place to get to the next and so on.There are way better rpg's out there. Take for example, Arcanum. In this game, you choose what you learn, your personality, your strengths/weaknesses, between good and evil, who follows you, what quests to do, etc. In Golden Sun, you get to choose...NOTHING! There are way better games out there..."
5,The best game yet,In this game you talk alot and for long periods of time but it's worth it I would recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG games.It has great graphics.
5,Arguably the greatest game for GBA of its time.,"Golden Sun, for the GBA, is, in my opinion, one of the premier RPGs of its time, and sets the bar for future role-playing games. Its mixture of fighting and traveling makes it likeable to even the pickiest of players. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,The Greatest RPG for the GameBoy Advance!!!,"I am a big fan of RPG's and ever since I bought a GBA, I wanted to see a SNES RPG port to the GBA and I got something even better. I love how Golden Sun is just like a classic RPG in every way. It has the great beginning, awsome battle system, great story line, great characters and most of all great graphics, it has the best graphics of any GBA game. The challenge level is just right and it also throws in some puzzles throughout the dungeons. The bosses are awsome.If you love RPG's and you have a GBA, go get this NOW!!!!"
5,"This Game Is Golden, Baby!!","By far, Golden Sun was the greatest Game of all time. I fell in llove with it the first time I played it. It has unique RPG elemants, the best battle system ever, and the ultimate plot. On your quest, however, you will meet four types of creatures called Djinni. They consist of Venus, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter. You have to set them , and then you summon. Before I get to fanboyish, the game is not without it's flaws. Random battles come up too often, and level building is a bit tedius. But if you are torn between this game and Breath of Fire, GET GOLDEN SUN!!!! It has a better plot and graphics."
3,Only half a game!,"Despite being a great game graphics-wise, the biggest problem I had with this game is that it does not stand on its own. I thought I had gotten a great deal on a good game only to find out that the game ""ends"" in such a way that you are only half finished with your quest and have to buy the next one - Golden Sun: The Lost Age if you ever want to get to the actual ending. A great tactic by the makers but very frustrating for someone who was just looking for a good game and only got half of one."
5,One of the best games ever!,This game is one of the best games out there OF ANY CONSOLE!!!! it took me around 7 days to beat it (going quite fast) but the best thing about this game is all the puzzles and mazes but no matter how many times you played this game you'll never remember it fully. amazing GBA game!
5,goldensun,"i had re-buy this game, but now i have it so i am happy. very cute gameplay good story line and the battles are very fun. many items to find. powerful bosses."
4,Really Great Game,"Golden Sun is an astonishing game. it's fun, addictive, and gorgeous. The only complaint i have is the random battles. It's hard to proceed in the game without your party being weakned by all the attacks. But that's only minor, you should really buy this game."
5,Mike da dawg,I luv dis game! Da grfics r awsome and da music is calming so u don't get frustrated to soon.It has some confusin parts in it but ya just gotta look hard. I recomend dis game fo everyone!
4,Pretty good game,"Well I have to say that this was a really good game. The graphics were great, the whole plot was great, but there was only one problem. The reason why this game got a 4 out of 5 from me, was the fact that there was a lot of talking. It is bearable but only because the game is so addicting. The next golden sun I think will be great, but I hope that there isn't as much talking as this game, but in all fairness this was a good ... kicking game that everyone should have in the collection."
3,Golden Sun: OVERRATED,"Golden Sun is far over rated. The battles are horrible boring and uninventive. I found myself wondoring ""Where do I go next"" many times, and that isn't any fun. It makes you think m""I really don't want to play it right now, im at that stupid part. The world map has a horrible set up. These coments are slight exadurations, but still, I would only reccomend this to the most devoted RPG fans. It does have a good plot, and good graphich though."
2,Not The Best RPG Experience,"Golden Sun looks awesome. It has great graphics and good control. However, this was my first real RPG experience and it left a bad taste in my mouth. There is SO MUCH dialog in this game that it lost my attention very quickly. Just to get through the opening sequence takes about 40 minutes of dialog. I keep hoping that I'll play and play some more and the dialog will get to a managable level, but it hasn't yet. If you like to hear little squeaky fake voices and read LOTS of dialog, get this game. If not, buy or wait for a not so RPGish game to come out...like The Legend of Zelda!"
4,ok,"It's a fun game, good graphics, good storyline. I think there is to much talking though. It also gets annoying when your trying to get somewhere and your constantly getting attacked by lame little monsters. I say less attacks and cooler, stronger monsters. The game could also use some more attacks."
5,Golden Sun....BUY IT NOW,"this is a great game. take final fantasy and put it on GBA thats what u got but slightly different which makes all the difference. ...good gameplay, great sound, easy to learn, lots of items, puzzles, magic, good storyline...etc i could just keep going. the only problem is there are only 4 characters and those are the ones u have to use, but being able to change their class makes up for it. summery of game= good buy it whenever u can!"
5,The best gme for the Game Boy Advance!!!,"This game is the best! I have beaten it in about a month. It is kinda short, but the graphics and all the rest of this great game is amazing! It doesn't matter if youare good or bad at playing Rpg's. This game is very easy to pick up. The large areas and the challenge of the game is great! This game is a MUST HAVE!!! I you don't have it, get it! If you don't want it, you are going to be crying later because you are left out! GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!"
5,A Revolution for the GBA RPG Genre,"This is one of the most facinating game for a hand held. The first time i saw the commercial, I was completely astonished. Buy this game"
4,[stinks],hello I have not brought the Gameboy advance but going to toysrus.com I began to browse through the GBA's to see what kind I would want when I get one I actually consideered buying Golden Sun when I get my GbA because of the reviews but when I looked at the graphics the thing that allows you to take a sneek peak they kinda really actually [stink] and everyone in the review says how cool they are when there really not so if your considering buying it please please please take a sneak peek at it and don't waste your money
5,golden sun rules,"you start out as the chracter issac (u can rename him if u want) and u basically go on an adventure of the world-fight monsters and bosses and get 3 other people in ure party along the way. I loved the game and i played about 48 hours total :). I beat the game so many times over and over again by killing the last boss which is the fusion dragon. Though the fusion dragon isn't tough, deadbeard is (hardest boss in the game) i killed him in like... 15 minutes.(my chracters are lvl 44+) He just takes forever so it's like the same thing over and over again, Issac and garet attacks ivan uses luff and mia heals."
4,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2,"Tony Hawk is fun and a piece of cake. It only took 1 to 2 hours just to beat the game. I would proably sell the game because this game is over in a snap. So if I where you I'd think about this game.THIS game is mostly about tournaments and doing high cool,asewsome,mumbo jumbo cool tricks in the air also you grind forever. the end"
1,this isn't good at all.,"This game isn't very good. first, You have to go through lots of very difficult levels, The people spend forever talking, and you have to find some artifact to restore the world. you have to use psychic and magical powers lIke earth, wind, sun, and fire(which i don't like). so iwouldn't recommend this game to impatient gamers."
4,one of the best (and hardest) games for GBA,"this game is gr8, its got awsome graphics, great sound, and a long game length. but here are the overall grades:graphics:9/10gameplay:10/10 (if you like rpg's)sound:8/10difficulty:10/10 (very difficult)overall grade:9.25/10the only recomondation I have is have a strategy guide ready if you get lost in dungeons or desserts."
2,"If you're looking for a good story, be careful","Golden Sun has some innovative gameplay, but if you dig your RPGs for the storyline, Golden Sun is a wash. You get what would essentially amount of eight hours of story-related gameplay in any other RPG stretched out to thirty or so. You know exactly as much of the plot at the end of the game as you did at the beginning of the game. So there are no plot twists, strange revelations. Nothing. If you want to see more you have to buy the sequel. The box doesn't advertise the fact this is a multi-part game, so I was extremely upset when I got to the end only to find out I didn't even get an ending.If gameplay is all you go for you'll probably like the psynergy abilities and the djinn. If you're looking for story, you're not going to find it here."
5,The Best Game EVER,"This is the best game ever created. The graphics are simply amazing, and the puzzles are in-depth and fun. The story revolves around you pursuing your friends who were captured at the begging of the game. This is a turned base attack system where you can physiclly attack, use a variety of majic spells, use items, or run. There are also majical creatures called djinn that increase your stats, change your class and give you new majic attacks. There are four types of djinn: earth, wind, water, and fire OH and you can use them in battle as attacks. There are so many different monsters and bosses. The Psyenergy that you use, like cloak, douse, wirlwind, and move help you solve the puzzles inside caves and dungeons. It sounds confusing but THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER CREATED. If you llike RPGS this for you. ..."
4,AWESOME!,This is the best game for GBA I have ever played. The graphics are like PS one graphics! The music is like little people are trapped in the GBA and singing. The plot and story are fantastic. BY THIS GAME!
3,"Fun, but too long and boring story and hard puzzles","This game is pretty fun in the gameplay but,in story elements of this game the characters babble on and on and on. There are also plenty of spots where got stuck in the game....... and i hate using walkthroughs. I quit playing it... got bored of it its not that exciting of a game but its ok....Buy it only if you want and in-depth and time consuming game."
1,Engrossing but also confusing,"This is a decent RPG game that features an expansive environment and tons of fun for RPG diehards. Unfortunately for the average gamer the gameplay is too complicated -- this game has by far the thickest manual of all GBA games I've seen. The graphics are attractive. Even though the storyline is quite lame and laughable, RPG fans will be easily engaged. All in all, a game worth getting."
1,this game is way to over rated,"people who say this game is so easy have either got a strategy guide that tells them exactly what to do or they just want to make the game sound fun. i can get past some of the first things that you do like going with Kraden up to the mountain and catching the theives, but then i get stuck because i can't figue out how to save the tree or how to get the magic water from the lighthouse. so basicly it is fun at first but the fun only lasts so long unless you have a really good strategy guide that tells you exactly what to do and where to go. this game was a waste of my time and money."
5,Best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,This game was great. I can't wait for number two. I sujest you get the nintendo power for this game. It takes a long time to bet but it is fun. There is more talking than the real game but it is fun.
5,Read this if you have ANY doubts about this game,"This is an RPG (role-playing game). What this means is that you control a character and walk around interacting with various other characters and places.OK, first, this game is just plain AWESOME. The level and depth of the storyline is incredible. It is definitely worth it. I bought it and just couldn't stop playing. I ""beat"" it in a week, but even if you beat it, there is still so much to do!! You can upgrade your team, search for other things to do (the freedom of movement is incredible, you can go pretty much where ever you want, when you want), and some things you don't need to do to beat the game can be also done (I know that sounds weird, but just think about it...)Anyway the bottom line is that anyone looking for a good game to play, stop looking and buy Golden Sun.The sequel is coming out sometime around Feb. 2003."
5,nintendo hits a gold mine,golden sun in my opion is the best gameboy advance game ive ever played( not including super mario bros.2 advace which I plan to get but its a remake of the classic). first off this game is betaiful and eye poping from the sommuns to the in game graphic as you walk around.the sound is awsome will just leave it at that:) and its just a blast to play I ratew it out like this.GRAPHICS 11/10( ive never seen a game look this good!)SOUND 10/10( execlent music)FUN FACTOR 10/10(this is just a blast to play.)REPLAY VALUE 9/10( theres not much to go searching around for after you finsh beside dijins)AVERAGE 10/10OVER ALL 10( by this game now!!!)
5,Simply an amazing RPG...,"I first played this game as a recommendation from a friend, and I wish to pass the same thoughts on to everyone else! It's got to be the very best GBA game I will ever play! The plot was spectacular, with only one major con to the main gameplay. There were WAY too many long speeches, and they were WAY too long. But besides that, it's an amazing game."
3,Can Crusher,"The sides of the pull down are made from a very light metal and in less than year they will fail. A more sturdy model would be better, that's why I purchased another one made of stronger metal."
4,review alum can crusher,"the product works. since this product is hard to find, I am grateful to have it."
2,Better than smashing them against your forehead,"Crushing your cans is a great idea if you are tight on space and far from the recycling center and you go through a lot of canned beverages. And you don't mind cleaning up the whole sticky crusher and surrounding area.That's a lot of ifs. I see why nobody has bothered to design a good can crusher.This one only squishes them to 1-1/4 inches. That's less than 4 to 1 compaction for a 12 oz. can.I put a block of wood in the bottom so the cans would squish to about 6/10 inch. That's 9:1.However the side arms are very flimsy and started twisting into a useless shape after I crushed about 90 cans.Also, about 5% of the cans fly out of the chamber before the crusher has a chance to do its work."
2,Bent after use,Worked fine for a while but didn't crush can as much as I'd like.The bottom piece started to deform and bend down. Then the cans would pop out as you tried to crush them.I tried to reinforce it with a block of wood and even with some metal L brackets. Didn't hold.I've given up and step on them on the concrete floor with better luck.Wish there were a decent crusher at less than $10!
4,It sure crushes them!,"I love this crusher! Being a big beer drinker, and a recycler, it makes life a lot easier. No more next morning stomping around the kitchen chrushing cans. Be advised shipping is more than the item, and it takes a bit for the crusher to loosen up and not stick. (hence 4 stars not 5) But all in all for the price and the fact that it works, I am happy.O and Keystone beer has a slightly taller can, which does not fit into the crusher unless pre-dented. just FYI."
4,"Smash those cans, reduce cthe trash and recycle aluminum cans","Here's the easy, painless way to contribute to go greener. Mount the crusher on a 1"" x 3"" board and nail it on a garage or close wall. Work off a little aggression while you cutting back on the bulk of recyclable drink cans. Squeeze the middle of the can, then pull the handle to magically change cans to a fraction of their original size to make t more manageable to take hundreds/thousands of cans to the recycle drop-off."
4,For the kid in you...,"A good story that is also well written. Though it becomes readily obvious that it has strong ties to R.L. Stephenson's sea-faring classics, it remains an enjoyable read. Good for fledgeling sci-fi addicts and subway reading. Do it for the kid in you, read this one; you won't regret it."
3,Fast paced adventure in space.,"O.K. References to Treasure Island are valid to an extent. But that did not decrease my enjoyment of this book. It is very entertaining, told simply but effectively. There is plenty of suspense and action. Any criticisms I might have do not include boredom. I don't believe the story was written to explore any ground breaking ideas or to evoke powerful emotions. It is simply about adventure, told from the point of view of the most likely to experience adventure to the fullest. A kid. Don't have heavy expectations going in. Relax, and as you read remember how easy it was to appreciate adventure as a kid. In that context, this is an enjoyable break from heavy issues of adulthood."
3,Treasure Island in Space,"This book is essential an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's to a science fiction setting. Instead of a pirate treasure, they are looking for an interstellar drive. There is a Long John Silver character, although he has benefitted from improvements in medical technology. It's not a bad read, but it's surprisingly shallow for someone of Sheffield's talents"
1,"""Treasure Island"" in space.... is a waste.","The Author has made a career of rewritting classics of literature in a science fiction setting. Unfortunately, ""Godspeed"" takes the ""Treasure Island"" plot of a young boy yearning for adventure, befriended by an old pirate... ah, I mean old spaceman with a treasure map... Woops, I mean a mysterious high-tech navigational device, nowhere.The book is filled with these substitutions of pirate book archtypes with science fiction ones. The Author is missing the major reason for science fiction. New Ideas and a sense of wonder are totally missing from this book. If your able to make it to the end of the book its only because you make a habit of finishing what you started.Please avoid this book! I wish I had been warned."
1,Divert failed (actually never held water),"WIth reqrets, we purchased this line of Delta products which is now discontinued. The diverter never worked and leaked heavily when in the shower mode. Delta ABSOLUTELY backed up the product. Unfortunately, they don't carry replacement parts for their discontinued lines. They quickly replaced the entire trim kit with another line. The only sad part is that this won't match the vanity or towel holders. It also won't match the master bath which is completely done with the Lockwood PT line. Oh well."
3,Good Product - No Replacement Blades,"I have owned one of these for two years, and I like it very much. It serves its purpose very well. But here's the catch... I have broken a blade, and I can't seem to find replacement blades. The blades are obviously swappable and therefore replaceable. Why do they not sell replacements?? That's a pretty big 'gotcha'.I will probably go find an alternative product becuase of that."
3,Stanley 20-092 3 in 1 Saw Set,nice but its got plastic teeth that hold the blade in the handle if you bear down on it too much the teeth will give waylight duty its great
5,HDMI cable (affordable),"This ""affordable cable"" works the same as the VERY expensive Monster brand... I am quite pleased with it"
4,good,"The HDMI cable is a bargain. It is solid. I usually use it to send 1080i from a cable box from the basement to HDTV. It works excellent for that. I have also used it with 1080p from my computer in the basement. At 1080p, there is some artifact that was noticable. Over time it faded or became less notable. Not sure if that was me or the connection. It probalby is not the best option for those trying to have 1080p with high refresh rates, but I am guessing everyone's experience will be somewhat different. Overall, this does an excellent job and for the money, it is pretty tough to beat."
2,a little misleading,"The description says great for babies, but what it doesn't say is that it is not for children under 2. I learned that when my item arrived and the tag around its neck had that warning on it. Great to know since I bought it for my three month old niece."
4,Don't Mess with the Ladies...,"This is a good book for the ladies of all of those kilt-wearing men who portray Jacobite soldiers in the '45 Rising. Extensive research is evident throughout. Women played a huge role in the Rising, from recruiting soldiers to gathering intelligence. This book explores the activities of some of the most fervent, yet overlooked, Jacobites: the women.Good resource for adding depth to reenactment personae."
4,TRACK LISTING,"GOOD CHOICE FOR THIS XMASTrack listing1. Santa Claus Llega A La Ciudad :: Santa Claus Is Coming To Town2. Te Deseos Muy Felices Fiestas :: Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas3. Frente A La Chimenea :: Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer4. Blanca Navidad :: White Christmas5. Navidad, Navidad :: Jingle Bells6. Estar En Mi Casa Esta Navidad :: I'll Be Home For Christmas7. Mi Humilde Oracion :: My Grown-Up Christmas8. Va A Nevar :: Let It Snow9. Sonrie :: Smile10. Llego La Navidad :: Winter Wonderland11. Noche De Paz :: Silent Night"
1,Did not fit,"This air filter replacement was extremely difficult to find. The advertisement said this replacment filter would fit our OAC150RF and it didn't. We had to take if out of the box, cut it to fit."
2,A bad Car Accident...,"You can't help but look. Staring, hating yourself for doing so. This describes this and the whole 'hope' series. So bad, so horrible you HAVE to read them all."
2,Overrated,"I think this book should have two sets of reviews, one set for those people who are in its target market (males under age 25) and another for everyone else.As someone in the ""everyone else"" category, I was not impressed. This is not the worst book ever written but it's pretty bad. The writing is decent but the lead character is unlikeable and uninteresting, the other characters are little more than cariacatures, spankings (yes, spankings) abound and contrivance is heaped upon contrivance in order to get our young ""hero"" in command of the spaceship."
5,A great debut into the sci-fi genre,"Feintuch's melodramatic sci-fi epic begins here with Midshipman's Hope. I bought this book at the University of Washington book store some years ago and I still remember how the clerk, who had read it, described the book: ""It's terrific! It's like Admiral Hornblower meets Star Wars!"" The subsequent books in the Nicholas Seafort saga are also excellent, but none of them resonates with the energy and originality of this, the first in the series. Don't miss it!"
5,It's just the beginning,"It's just the beginning of a terrific series, and I hope there will be more. Nicholas Seafort is a real person, with real doubts and real feelings of inadequacy, thrown into situations that try men's souls. He is not Ender, by any means; the books are quite dissimilar. In a way, he is more like Harry Flashman, but in a darker and more realistic manner. I have heard Seafort compared to Horatio Hornblower, but I haven't actually read those yet, so I dunno... Never mind, just start with this one and get ready for a grand adventure, followed, thankfully, by many more."
2,Fast Paced but AWFUL,"I admit that I read this book in two sittings; but I was on vacation and waiting for planes. The book has some interesting action and is a ""page turner""; however, the way it treats the military is a crime (punishable by hanging). The main character is full of self doubt and stupidity. If he (or any of the other characters in the book) acted with some intelligence there would be no plot at all. If you respect the military then avoid this book. If you like to view the military as an evil system that perverts and distorts the young, then this book is for you.There is nothing really new in this book. I strongly suggest that you read something by Forester or Webber instead of this dreck."
2,"Pretty Good Read, But I Couldn't Suspend Disbelief","Not a bad story, but the ""fish"" were just too incredible - my faculty for suspension of disbelief was overloaded. This is fantasy masquerading as science fiction.watziznaym@gmail.com"
3,Entertaining with Reservations,"First, let me point out that the book definitely has a homoerotic theme. From page 296-97:""I moved closer to the fire, watching my handsome midshipman's face as he chatted with Amanda. Odd feelings stirred, recalling Jason, eons past.""Second, I agree that the world as described would be pretty unpleasant.Last, I agree that the book has an uncomfortable number of unlikely events.All that said, it's still pretty entertaining."
1,It was the worst book i have ever read!!!,If you are just wondering if you should give this book a try do your self a favor ...Don't do it!!!!! this book is not only a waste of time it is an insult to your imagination....
5,Buy the whole series right away.,"Get the whole series at once because you won't be able to stop. I bought the first book, because I was intrigued by the dust jacket comments. I finished the first book in two days, and immediately went out and purchased the whole series. I had to practically lock up the second book to keep myself away from it."
5,I am speechless in admiration.,"It has been a honor to get to know Captain Seafort. The cynicism and fatigue of age drop away in shame at my own self pity. I owe you, Mr. Feintuch"
5,Best book ever,"This book does what few others can, enthrall you with an amazing and engaging tale while at the same time developing characters that you could cry with or laugh with. I've read it 10 times and it's always amazing what Feintuch has done"
3,Fairly entertaining but a bit excessive on the S&M,"Fast paced, good characterization, and lots of action. The story is marred by the homoeroticism and the excessive sado masochistic scenes. They just seemed too out of place and barbaric in such a technologically advanced setting. Otherwise, the story was pretty entertaining."
4,Very good account of how military discipline works.,"I was surprised by this, apparantly a first time novelist. Lots on how a futeristic space navy works and operates and how military discipline makes or breaks a person/ship/situation. Good writing, this book was un-pu-downable for me. I would even let my kids (and will -11 and 13 yo) read this book."
1,Calculus,"Don' t pick this one, so terriable. I had ordered the book almost one month ago, but I got nothing besides waste my time and money!!!!! Be careful!"
1,Again and again and again,"Again I will say for the umpteenth time. This book is NO GOOD. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF IMPROVEMENTS THIS LOW-QUALITY BOOK MADE.I've used the 4th edition of this low quality book and I saw the previous editions to it. I don't EVEN begin to think that this so-called new 5th addition brings anything new to the table that the calculus student can benefit from.I will speak as a pharmacy student from an accredited pharmacy school. If any professor asked me to recommend a calculus book to teach his class the one recommendation I would give to that math teacher is to ""STAY AWAY FROM THIS AUTHOR AND HIS CALCULUS BOOKS"". There are way too may user-friendly calculus that explain the concepts and methodology of calculus one million times better than what Stewart and his collegues can write.Stewart needs to retire from the math texbook writing business."
3,American Military Insignia 1800-1851,I enjoy this bookbut I think they should have the pictures in the ebookthe image's add so much to what you are reading aboutwithout them you loose alot of meaning of this doc.thanks for having books like this for us to read
5,Great warfare tool.,"This is a great book to begin working with people in the area of deliverance. It doesn't get too indepth while not sacrificing the basics you need. Also contains sample questionaires, etc."
1,A rip-off! I could hardly cast out any demons!!,"First, let me say that I was deeply disappointed by this book. The title led me to believe that, after reading it, I would be able to identify and cast out demons. However, while the first part was true, the second part was not. Sure, I was able to identify the demons that had infected my houseplants and cause my pizza to burn the roof of my mouth after I took a big bite immediately after removing it from the microwave, but no amount of chanting Ms. Wagner's incantations would force the denizens of darkness back to the fire from whence they came. Now I'm wondering if her magic is powerful enough to overthrow these demons, or if I should seek the help of a more powerful sorceress?"
2,Just not that good-,"There's a lot better out there. My review wasn't exhaustive but I ordered it after the good reviews and... there's just a lot better out there. Some of the business is just wrong too, if I'm not mistaken. A lot of it is, sorry to say, comically fundamentalist. There's a lot better out there."
2,Disappointing,"I can not recommend this book. I tried its methods on my little brother and there was no change. It turned out that he only had the hiccups, but still."
5,"I got it, I dig it","I wanted to be able to bake beans in something that wouldn't burn the outer couple inches of beans, like my cast iron dutch oven did, so I went for this bean pot, made of some really fine ceramic. I gotta tell you, I enjoy my beans, as they are the musical fruit, and when I baked a batch of beans in this beauty, I knew I would be able to eat more, thereby being able to toot more.I think I'll get another, so as I will be able to toot twice as much.The price is nice, too."
1,Poor customer service,I have NOT received my credit for this - I was supposed to get it around January 9.
5,White Mountains Fifties 1000 pc Jigsaw Puzzle,I just completed it and it is great. Didn't realize some of the people are as old as they are.
4,Made of TIN *not* stainless steel,"I called the company (unfortunately after I had already purchased this item), and the 12 cup muffin pan is made of tin not stainless steel. Drat. If you are looking for a healthier alternative to nonstick (and tin), I suggest a stoneware muffin pan. Pampered Chef is the only company that I know of who makes one. Check their website for a more fair price than the one listed on this website. ;)"
1,inexpensive for a reason,"I wanted a nonreactive muffin tin to replace my old nonstick, since I have tried to eliminate nonstick products from my kitchen for health reasons. I debated on purchasing this after reading the reviews, and ultimately decided to give it a try since it wasn't too pricy. The very first time I used it, I let the muffins sit in it overnight and when I went to wash the pan the next morning, it had rusted out. I have a fox run stainless steel muffin pan as well, and I have often let the muffins sit in it without ever having a rust problem. I'd strongly recommend paying a little more money for a much higher quality product. This pan is clearly ""cheap,"" not just inexpensive."
4,I like it,"Se ven muy bien, aun no los uso! No cambien la calidad y seguire comprando con ustedes. Gracias por siempre preguntar por la satisfaccion del cliente."
4,Fun for all.,"Daughter loves playing with this play food toy. She chews on the pieces, so the wood has some odd wear & tear on it. Has small pieces, so they end up scattered around house, but toys end up everywhere in our house. She loves trying to serve us pizza, I think this toy will last us a while & be used quite a bit. Definitely glad we bought it. Would recommend."
5,great toy,"They best thing about this toy is that there are plenty of topping pieces, so if the kid loses one (like they will) they tend not to notice.My daughter loves it."
3,Just ok,I do not like how the individual pieces are the size of a Quarter to decorate the pizza.this says for kids 3 and older but my guess would be for 6 and older. Kids younger than that are way to adventurous putting things in their mouths
5,Excellent Toy,My daughter played with this toy at her cousins house and just loved it! I had seen a lot of the Melissa & Doug toys online but never in person. My sister in-law told me she got it at TJ Maxx so I went there to get one for my daughter. It was $12 or $14 and of course there was no shipping charge. Very durable high quality toy.
4,"First rate - typical for Lights, Camera, Interaction","I seek out this company because everything we have ever received from them is top notch. Really well constructed, fun, and encouraging creative play. My only quarrel with this project is that it is not well-contained: envision pizza parts all over your living room. I'd suggest putting away the extra pieces and waiting until the few you've kept out become lost before bringing out more. Otherwise, though, a great toy."
5,A+++++++++!!!!!!!!,What a fun and durable way to play with food and make believe! My four year old could not wait for me to open it and has played with it just about everyday since we got it!!! Endless hours of imagination and great for sorting skills too!!!
5,My kids love this pizza!!,Great durable toy! The kids (2-4.5yrs) love playing with this toy. The pieces all velcro together.
5,Another great Melissa & Doug product!,"I was just recently introducted to Melissa & Doug, and have been really impressed. Their products are well made and durable, and I love the idea of velcro on pieces. My daughter received the pizza party set for Christmas and she's played with it several times a day since. She loves be able to mix and match the toppings, then when it's time to clean up she loves seperating the toppings into their own spots. The pizza cutter is such a neat addition to the set, We've had multiple pizza parties! I would definitely recommend this for any parent looking for something fun for their child to do."
3,Pretty good,"This was a fun toy, but the small pieces of pizza toppings end up all over your house. If you have an infant toddling around, a very bad idea as they are a choking hazard. Would I recommend this item? Probably not, as it's just a pain to find the pieces! Yet it is well made and fun for them."
3,Pizza party is a little boring . . .,"My 2 year old is a big fan of Melissa & Doug toys, as are myself and my husband (they are safe, durable, and educational), but this one just does not hold her interest as much as other similar toys they make. I rate it an ""okay."" I highly recommend parents instead consider Melissa and Doug's cutting food set or sandwich making set, my 2yr old plays with these for hours and still loves them!"
3,"OK, but pieces everywhere and lack of variety","I decided to get my kids this set thinking it would be fun for them to ""cut"" the slices and try out the different toppings. Well, they had fun with that for a few days but quickly bored of the scenario. My biggest complaint, however, is the little topping pieces start to lose their velcro stick and I keep finding them all over the house. It's annoying. No, there's no cover to the box. The things I do like about the toy: the plate, cover, the fact that the kids can ""slice"" the pizza make it fun. Plus, the pizza concept is pretty unique for play food. But I wish I had bought another variety play food set to keep them interested for a longer period of time."
3,Good toy,"We got this toy for our daughter who will turn 3 soon. She seems to like it, but doesn't play with it all that much yet. (We just gave it to her for Xmas about two weeks ago.) It is clever that the pizza toppings velcro to the top of the slices, but the slices also velcro to each other, which makes it difficult for her to ""cut"" the pizza and remove the slices. The toy seems well made and durable and I expect that she'll like it more over time."
3,learning,Bought it for my grandsons the idea is good but too many small pieces and my youngest still puts everything in his mouth so dangerous. not clourful enough
3,Junky Junky Fun Toy,"My son received this for his second birthday. It was an instant hit. He likes to cut the pizza and roll out the dough. (We received a rolling pin as well.) He is less interested in the toppings. So, three stars for that.But only three stars because it had terrible chemical off gassing for weeks after it came out the packaging. Nasty, nasty chemical smell. And the paint is really poorly applied with missing spots, chips, and already some wear and tear from very modest use. Like a lot of MIC M&D;, this is really junky. Now if only Plan Toys made a better version..."
2,Basic toy !!!,Buy this toy for my 6 year old niece.In this age love to role play like this. To play alone or with other children.The size is very small expected something bigger.But it was OK for the price
4,Very fun for pretend play,My girls aged 1 and 4 love the Melissa and Doug food sets. They are very durable and cute. It's a nice break from all the plastic toys out there. My only complaint is that the box does not have a lid. This makes keeping everything together so much harder...
4,"Great fun, but needs better storage box","My daughter received this as a birthday present at age 2y. It has held up well over the past year and half, providing hours of play. The velcro still hold up over time and the kids keep going back to it again and again. I have not noticed any chipping paint at all. My kids love to play restaurant, cooking dinner, tea party, and this is a great set. We also work on counting and concepts like half and whole.The storage box, however, is a problem. We have ended up with pieces everywhere because there is no lid to the box to help hold everything together. A lid would also make it easier to stack with other toys when putting things away."
5,Excellent product !,"I love Melissa and Doug toys, They are so well made and so much fun. I have bought this set four times for gifts. Keep up the quality work."
4,Daughter loves it!,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. She plays with it every day, which is saying a lot considering her attention span. I love that it is made of wood and the velcro sticks really well. Only thing I don't like which is the case with so many Melissa and Doug product is that there is no cover so there is no real way to contain the small pieces from my infant who will be crawling soon."
5,Grandchildren love it!,Purchased this to stay at my house for when the grandchildren come. They helped me make the selection and love playing with the pizza party. I wish it came with a lid to help store it.
4,Good pizza set,"My 2-year-old son likes this a lot. He can't really put the pieces on the pizza but he likes slicing the pizza pie. One of the toppings did break, but the rest are fine."
5,great product,We own 3 of this product. The 4th went to Toys for tots xmas donation.This product has lasted through 5 grandchildren. They are still in great shapemy youngest grandson age 3 is just starting to pay with this product.I strongly advise to be used for 3 years and up. My 6 year old gradddaughter is still playing with these toys.All I can say is BUY THEM. You cannot go wrong.
3,Standard Western Worth Watching For Joel McCrea,"At a brisk 81 minutes, THE GUNFIGHT AT DODGE CITY, is an easy way to pass the time. The plot is rather predictable and there are few surprises, but Joel McCrea is such a good actor that he elevates the rather mediocre script. The titular gunfight takes place in the final five minutes of the movie, and is anti-climatic. However, there are things to enjoy in the movie, such as good character development and some well-filmed action scenes. All of the standard Western cliches are present, and the film certainly breaks no new ground as later Westertns would, but it's still worth watching at least once, especially for the underrated Joel McCrea."
4,Salaam-e-Ishq,"Good movie, well said story, DVD quality is very good compared to the other DVD's I received rom this seller............."
2,Bollywood Bloat,"**1/2Clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes, ""Salaam-e-Ishq"" is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love (which is at least four tales too many in my estimation).Filmed like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial, the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy showgirls, high-stepping song-and-dance numbers, dream and fantasy sequences, winking character asides, corny dialogue and way-over-the-top comical performances - all pretty much standard-issue stuff when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days. It's an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance, prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline.There's plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here - not least of all the drop dead gorgeous women - but he'll need the patience of Job to get him all the way through it."
2,dissappointing film.,"With all the talent in this film - S Khan, Priyanka, Vidya Balan, veterans like ANil Kapoor and Juhi, i expected so much more....but the performances were lackluster and the plots uninteresting.However, there are some good musical numbers (the best, mera dil was cut out!) some 'moments' between Vidya and John A., and Govinda's performance is outstanding. its worth a rental and flick around to the music and select scenes, but hard to sit through for 3+ hoursas for the DVD, unfortunately, its an EROS DVD - as usual, shoddily put together and no extras (and commercials stuck in the front) and its not even formatted correctly (chops off the sides of the image)."
3,ok,"Four couples and their realization of love - married man in ?mid-life crisis, foolhardy dude with pre-wedding jitters, long-time admirer staking claim, and pure accident with Govinda - i thought was cute!! Not bad overall, bought it cos I'm a PC fan but got to see SK, Juhi Chawla, Anil kapoor and others too. Quirky enough to warrant a second time watch (and therefore ok for a buy rather than rent), plus music was ok. Not sure about the chemistry between PC and SK... not very convincing but ok I guess..."
4,Work well,Better than the titanium coated bits because there is no coating to wear off. Wish the bits tilted out in the holder. Nice sturdy case other than that.
5,A delight,"Music of this sort, written perhaps for when one might be at table eating, really commands more attention than the designation of ""Tafelmusik"" might suggest. There are some wonderful surprises here, typical of Telemann's inventiveness, and the performances are solid and consistent from piece to piece. For the price, this performance of thoroughly enjoyable Telemann is a bargain."
2,Sorry - this is so overrated...,"I guess I'm going to rain on this parade. I am a huge fan of Gillespie, and Parker given the right venue...but this is not it. Nobody is on the same page here, and the bass overdubs do not help. Bud Powell has moments but not enough to make up for the disarray. It sounds almost like Diz and Bird are mad at each other and it is carrying over into the music. I know, I know...this is supposed to be 'the bomb'. It is, unfortunately just A bomb."
1,BEWARE - FAKE T3 PRODUCTS ARE ON AMAZON,DO NOT BUY HAIRDRYERS T3 FROM AMAZON MERCHANTS. NONE OF THEM FALL WITHIN THE MFG WARRANTY AND THEY WILL BREAK AND NO ONE WILL HELP YOU. AMAZON WILL HIDE BEHIND THEIR 90 DAY POLICY AND THE SELLERS ARE SMALL SHOPS THAT DON'T NEED YOUR LOYALTY AND MAY AT BEST OFFER TO SEND YOU A REPLACEMENT FAKE HAIRDRYER. WHICH WILL ALSO PROBABLY BREAK AND NOT FALL UNDER THE 4 YEAR WARRANTY. SEPHORA AND DEPT STORES ARE AUTHORIZED DEALERS.
1,TERRIBLE! Fell apart the third time I used it.,"I bought one of these at a Sephora, and I was really happy with it at first. However, the THIRD time I used it, the fan became dislodged mid-blow dry and the thing stopped working. There was no way to open it up and fix it myself. I wasn't mis-using it at all, I had kept it in the box the entire time, it just fell apart. I would expect MUCH more out of a $130 blow dryer. And to make matters worse, I tried to exchange it at Sephora, and they told me to go directly through the manufacturers using the warranty. When I emailed T3, I was told I'd have to pay $15 for shipping to receive a new one. So basically, after their blow dryer fell apart, they wanted me to pay MORE money to get a new one. Thanks, but I'd rather try out a higher-quality product that stays in tact."
1,AVIOD this hair dryer - please learn from my mistake...,"hi. whatever you do, please do not purchase this hair dryer.could i not just be happy with my perfectly decent little hair dryer from wal-mart?nooooooooo, i HAD to have the 'status' hair dryer?!?result: 130 dollars out the window.like many of the other unfortunate reviewers, i shelled out the money for the T3 only to have it break after the 4th use! no receipt or box...so of course Sephora said 'too bad, not our problem.' now i have to toss it in the bin. what a waste of money."
1,Mine broke too.,"Yup. Mine broke, too. It was the same situation as one of the other reviews. I was in the middle of using it, and the fan popped out of place. I have never dropped it or used it incorrectly, either. I even got out a screwdriver and attempted to open it up and fix it myself, but as was already mentioned, you cannot open up the top part of the dryer without breaking it. Believe me, I tried. Mine took 6 months to break on me. So it lasted a little longer than some of the other reviewer's dryers did, but that's still totally unacceptable for a 130 dollar hair dryer. Of course, the receipt and warranty card got lost when I moved this summer, so I guess the 130 dollar dryer is now going in the trash. Shame, because it worked well up until it broke. I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing."
1,Do not buy from Discount Jungle,"I returned the hair dryer because the 240 V setting did not work. Even though the product was defective, discount jungle continued to charge me a restocking fee. To top it off they sent me the wrong shipping label for the return, so I had to pay for that as well. I will never order from this company again."
1,Another broken fan,Add me to the list of people who loved this dryer until the fan broke. I used mine for less than two months during my weekend travel (so maybe 10-15 times??).
1,Fan breaks again,"I am on my 5th T3 travel dryer. Why 5? Because I bought the first one at Sephora and the fan became dislodged after about 1 month of use. They replaced it, then another dislodge, replace, dislodge, replace and so on and so on. I really like the dryer and as long as Sephora keeps replacing it, I will keep returning. BUT I would have bought another brand had I not already shelled out the $$$$ for this one."
1,Another broken T3 Overnight...,"Well, another broken T3 overnight to add to the list. I purchased the unit from Sephora, not Amazon, as many of the reviewers have. Unfortunately, I don't have my receipt so I can't try and do a return or exchange. The dryer worked the first couple of times I used it. I have a larger version that I use daily and haven't had any problems with, but the Overnight was simply for travel. I didn't have fun on vacation when I pulled out the dryer to try and use it, and the second I flipped it on, the fan broke off. As others have mentioned, you can't take off the back wire mesh, so it can't be fixed. I'm very disappointed. That's a lot of money for a broken product."
1,breaks. fast.,"i am always skeptical of people who say that the item they purchase breaks in the first few times they use it, but this hairdryer actually did just that...the very first time i turned it on, the fan became dislodged and stopped working and then started to give off this awful, burning hair type smell.worthless. dont buy it."
1,T3 overnight hair dryer,I received this hair dryer .... plugged it in and it started smoking.... It also started to smell as if something was burning.... what a disappointment
1,Faulty product. Broke twice.,I purchased one of these from a department store. It broke in the first few months. They replaced it and the replacement broke soon after.
4,Freestyle review,"My wife enjoyed this CD so much, she instantly had a dance party in the kitchen the first time she played it. My sister wants her own copy now."
4,Nice way to tie both meaning of Christmas,"I liked this book for my daughter. It had nice, almost watercoler like, illustrations. The story line was also a nice way to tie in both the story of Christ birth and Santa Claus."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was looking forward to a story to introduce a 3 year old to the true meaning of Christmas. This was not it. Did not hold her interest, pictures too dull. The entire book just did not captivate and engage the child."
5,My favorite children's Christmas story!,I stumbled across this title several years ago and it has become my favorite. When the animals at the North Pole find Santa too tired to make his rounds the animals are afraid there will be not Christmas. But Santa reassures them he is not what Christmas is really about and tells them the reason for the season. Beautiful illustrations too!
4,Dry,"The information of this text is extremely interested, however the author doesn't seem able to write in a manner to show passion."
5,Excellent,"Book is a great review of photosynthesis, and pulls together the different parts of photosynthesis to make a readable whole."
4,Great Results,"The routine that this books presents if very demanding, but Mcneil and Frink explain perfectly how to slowly integrate the exercises into one's daily practice. The book is divided into 4 sections (Flexibility, Articulation, Pedal Tones, and Quick register Changes), each geared toward the intermediate to advanced player. A method of approaching and progressing through each section is presented, and if it is followed properly I can guarantee the results.I hit one section every day for about 30 minutes (except pedal tones, which I do for about 10), and have achieved amazing results, especially with articulation. Highly recommended for any kind of trumpet playing."
5,Highly Recommended,"I just bought it...McNeil and Frink really know what they're talking about. Great book, highly recommended."
4,Great for those that need reading glasses and eye protection,These have worked great for me. I now need reading glasses and having to switch to cheaters was inconvenient. Because of the price I purchased both a clear set and a gray set of the 1.0 diopter. They work well on the production floor and at the range. I could much easier see the front sight of the pistol without making the target too blurred. The reason that it is not a 5 star is that they are easily scratched and a 0.75 diopter would be a nice choice for clarity of sights and targets. I would have gladly spent another 50 cents for a cheap cloth bag to slip them into.
4,Not ALL the recipes are bad...,"I encountered this book in my mom's cookbook collection in the early 80's. I was particularly drawn to the Peanut Butter Balls recipe... I was an experimental young ""tween"" and decided to try it. Today I got an unbelievable craving for these treats and decided to look online to see if this book still existed so I could find the recipe. I had to laugh at the reviews of this book... that the recipes tasted ""earthy"" and such. This Peanut Butter Balls recipe is a winner! If you get the book, you must try it! Happy to hear the book had a much larger purpose without me knowing it at the tender age of 13. I'll consider getting a copy as these are issues I'm concerned about today. Don't think I'll be trying the yogurt barley soup recipe, however... ;)"
4,Diet for a Small Planet,"This is an awesome resource. I originally got it from the library, but couldn't finish it in time and wanted it as a future reference anyways. I'm still reading it and am learning so much about world hunger, my role in it, complete protein combinations, and everything in between. With that said, I haven't read the original version, but it seems as though the 20th anniversary edition has a bit too much editorializing for my taste. I would rather the book be written more ""professionally"" without all of the background information about what Frances Moore Lappe was thinking when she wrote each chapter and what was going on in her personal life. Just the same, I love this book and can't wait to finish it."
5,Diet For A Small Planet,This book is very helpful if you are aware of what you eat . The information is wonderful and helps anyone that is trying to diet or live healthy
4,A classic vegetarian cookbook,"This is the cookbook that taught me how to balance my proteins and make my vegetarian meals filling and satisfying. A classic that I intend to always keep on hand. There are some great recipes in this book, but there are also some real duds."
5,One of my all time favorites for my vegetarian lifestyle,"I had this book back when I was a hippie in the late 60s and early 70s. Great presentation and terrific recipes. Highly recommend this for anyone interested in living simply so others may simply live. Also got the new ""Hope's Edge"" which is an update of this book. Will always have this on my bookshelf."
5,It's Still the One,This is still a great cookbook with helpful ideas for creating delicious and nutritious meals. I love their blueberry cobbler recipe and still use it at least once a month.
2,"Decent recipes, poor understanding of economics","The recipes are reasonable, but the real issue in vegetarian diets isn't protein - instead the problem comes from the reduced availability of iron and other minerals.The economics are simplistic; even if every American quit eating meat products tomorrow, the Third World countries are unlikely to quit growing cash crops and instead grow food for their populations. The sentiments are nice, and warm and fuzzy, and the author's heart, is in the right place."
2,Soap Box,"Thank God this book was inexpensive. This book focuses on how world economics of the food chain. I do not eat beef and am trying to become a complete vegetarian and I thought this book would would give me advise on how to do that. Instead it lectures. She says the same thing over and over and over again. Talks a lot about her other book that she co authored and about how lost she was until she found ""her soap box"". I give it a 2 because there is some good information in the book. I will save you the money, here is what I thought was beneficial. Cows eat (grain and water) more then they produce in meat. We eat more protein then the body needs. We can get a complete protein by eating rice, beans and vegetables. It reinforces my belief in not eating beef and becoming non dependant on animal products because of the hormones and antibotics the manufactures put into the products. If you are curious about this book I would recommend the library."
2,wrong product sent,"I ordered this book diet for a small planet spiral bound, though what I received was one in paper back not spiral bound.I have the paper back one already . They didn't have what I ordered, what I wanted in stock.It was a problem to return and complicated to deal with in the end I gave up and kept the book. BurrIn short I ordered this book and did not get what was advertised what I wanted."
5,A classic,"If you are vegetarian, vegan, care at all about the planet, or your own health, you should read this book. It is referenced in so many books I've read, I finally had to check it out. It's inspiring, as it was written by a lady who becomes a single mom in the course of writing the book."
2,Help I need the Dummies Guide to 'Diet For a Small Planet'!,"The idea of eating less meat has always appealed to me. I found this book in hopes of learning how to find other sources of protein. I just wanted a book to tell me some easy to read guidelines, all I found in this book was a lot of big words. You have to have a PHD in nutrition to read it. The more I read the more confused I got. This book is NOT for the casual reader."
5,Enjoyable and informative - I recommend this book,"I read ""Promoting Rumpelstiltskin: The Soloist's Guide to Spinning Straw into Gold"" while on a recent business flight from North Carolina to Connecticut. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and its lessons. As a matter of fact, I have already personally recommended it to 20 other soloists in my line of work."" - Randy Mitchell, The Entrepreneur's Source."
4,surprisingly enjoyable,"from reading the other review i was expecting this book to be dull and slow like the first ult. DD+elektra book, but i thought this was solidly written and enjoyable. i haven't really read any of the other DD/elektra books, but as a continuation of the ultimate versions of these characters i liked the plot's nice amount of twists and the characters' development. carey does a particularly good job highlighting the duo's conflicting beliefs and attitudes so that even when they're working together they're working less as a team and more as individuals. good to see the two sharing fight scenes, and although their relationship isn't explored so much, elektra's character does undergo some major events. looking forward to more ult. DD/elektra."
4,MY GRADE: B.,"This is Elektra and Daredevil in their early years and before they get the costumes as the latter is in law school and the former still has her family around her. Elektra always made references to what happened to her father but this is the first time I saw it depicted. A well known villain makes an appearance about midway through the story. As usual the relationship between Elektra and Daredevil is dysfunctional and unusually violent. I've always taken Elektra to be hotheaded, myopic and insensitive and this comic truly proves it. The very ending and Daredevil/Murdoch's parting words just reinforced everything and made me chuckle.ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B; ACTION: B minus; WHEN READ: mid May 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B."
4,It will steal your attention,"I had just got done with The First Commandment, and as I'm wont to do, I picked up the next book I saw by the same author. I don't think I've enjoyed a book like this in a long time. Whereas the characters are predictable, the middle of the book sweeps you up in its stunning twist. From there foreward, its a roller coaster ride of quick, descriptive action with a penchant for bloodletting becoming of a detective/mystery writer. I fell head over heels for Jack, Jannie, and Dick, even holding a soft spot for Himey Gore. I've re-read the book at least 8 times since owning it. You just can't go wrong with ""healthy junk food"" writing like this."
3,"Interesting characters, a good plot but fails to grip.","Interesting characters and a good plot. Moves along well, with plenty of action and suspense. But somehow it doesn't grip the reader like an ideal book should. Not one of Sanders best."
2,Not up to par.,"I usually like Lawrence Sanders's books, but this one was pretty pathetic. It was totatly implausable, with the cornball dialogue, cheeseball villains and melodramatic plotting of a saturday morning cartoon. The book tells the story of a thriller writer, who, having stalled creatively, decides to set up a heist in order to come up with material for a book. Unforturnately, she's soon in over her head. and so is Lawrence Sanders. Maybe he should have tried sticking up a bank."
5,ITS AMAZING,"THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING, IT WORKS FANOMINAL (SP) THE WAX IS INCREDIBLE THE WAX TAKES YOUR BULBS OF HAIR PALE OR BLACK OFF, EVEN THE SHORTEST AND MOST HARDEST IT PULLS IT OUT TO THE BULBS ITS GREAT, BUY THTE PRODUCT I SURE AM GLAD I DID, IT ALSO WORKS ON SIDE HAIR, UPPER/LOWER LIP, NECK, AND EYEBROWS."
5,Stop Everything.....This is it!!,"I've read just about every relationship book out there and this series by Doc Hendrix is the best thing I've ever ran across. Most books address symptoms, they provide patch work fixes. It feels like those other books treat aids lesions while the Imago method cures the aids!! I just can't say enough about these books! They are probably the hardest books I've ever read (fighting my ego the entire time I read it). This is more than about relationships....its about all human interaction. These books could change the world!!!PS: I know I sound like a 13 year old girl talking about Justin Beaver but I'd like to assure you I'm not prone to rants of affirmation over the latest and greatest fad...I'm actually kinda a cynic. These books will change you forever......if you've got the strength to actually look inside."
4,Good overview,"A good book, although the author seems to be more interested in discussing the various ideas and conceptions involving Hatchepsut than in the reign of the female king herself. If you are not already a student of Pharoanic Egypt then this is not a good book to jump into, despite the chapters which outline Egyptian history in general and the 18th Dynasty specifically. Tyldesley does not buy into various conspiracy theories involving the reign of this female king but instead discusses the mindset of the historians and archeologists and how their attitudes resulted in many modern concepts. An interesting book."
3,Not a biography,"This is not a biography. The author explains why this book could not be a biography -- not enough is known about the pharoah or her lifetime. This book is more for those who are interested in archaelogy/Egyptology. Still an interesting read, although the author's writing tends to read ""As I mentioned in Chapter 4"" or ""I will discuss further in Chapter 7"" (highly irritating)."
4,Hatchepsut: The Female Pharoah,The layout of the history leading to the story of Hatchepsut is very informative. I enjoyed knowing what is believed to be the events leading to her acension and the contributions she made during her reign. very interesting reading and well constructed.
2,not about hatchepsut,"I found myself scanning the pages just for Hatshepsut's name. This is a great book if you want to learn about Egypt's daily life and beliefs but tells you nothing about the subject, Hatshepsut!!! I would NOT buy again!!!"
2,THE FEMALE PHARAOH,"I BELIEVE THE SPELLING OF THIS QUEEN'S NAME IS WRONG - ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND BOOKS I READ REFER TO HER AS "" HATSHEPSUT"""
5,Historical Context for the Bible,"The late Dr. Asimov wrote extensively a wide range of scientific and historical books. Asimov famously said that his ""...peculiar memory allows me to unerringly remember everything that I've read."" His extensive reading and prodigious memory are on full display in his two-part ""Guide to the Bible."" The guide is NOT a religious nor sectarian work. Rather, it is an insightful elucidation of the historical events concurrent with the events recorded in the Judeo Christian scriptures. This book is an indispensable reference for anyone who is interested the the history of the development of Western thought and religion."
4,Martha Stewart Doesn't Live Here--But I Wish She Did,"Celebrating ten years of phenomenal success, Martha StewartLiving magazine offers an invaluable compilation of all the recipesthat have graced the magazine's cooking pages over the years, alongwith an abundance of interesting facts, useful cooking and cleaningtips, favorite menus of MLS food editors, personal stories aboutMartha, and much more.This is a same-easy to use format companionto the bestselling ""Martha Stewart Cookbook"", this newvolume is a compendium of more than 1,500 recipes that celebrates thetenth anniversary of the award-winning magazine. Master courses--thesignature 101's that are so popular in the magazine--explore recipeseveryone needs, including Spaghetti 101, Roast Chicken 101, Pizza 101,Turkey 101 and Caesar Salad 101.Great photos and greatideas. Martha, as I sip from my ""Martha Stewart Doesn't LiveHere"" coffee mug--I applaud you."
5,Best of the Best,"A great collection of the best from Tv, Magazines and Horsd'oeuvres - all in one book from canapes, lunch, soups, dinner dessert and classic 101s. I have several books- years of magazines etc. , but this puts the best recipes at your fingertips."
2,Not for those who already have a good number of cookbooks.,"I have a good number of cookbooks already. At this time I look for those that offer something different and new. As I went through this book I found only a couple of recipes that fit the bill. If you are just starting out acquiring a cookbook or two, this one is not bad. Overall, though, I would prefer cookbooks from the The New York Times over this one."
3,Use with common sense,"I was warned when I bought this book that Martha's recipes, which we know are from others on her staff, are tough to get to come out well due to flaws. I tried the Meatloaf 101 recipe and I created one of the worst meatloafs you could imagine. After putting vegetables into the food processor as directed I proceeded to run the processor for the time suggested. What I found was that when I was done the vegetables had been way over processed. I used them anyway thinking I may not understand what will come out, but the meatloaf was a mushy mess that was the consistency of dog food. Be very cautious when using this cookbook, use your kitchen common sense."
3,Martha Stewart Living Cookbook.,"Found this book to be a nice well rounded compilation of the Martha Stewart recipe collection. I have several other publications by Martha Stewart's. However, found many of the recipes included here are no doubt duplications that are also in her other books published at an earlier date. At the end of the day, it makes a nice gift or a welcome addition to any kitchen library."
3,Mixed Results from Recipes,"I have had mixed results from this cookbook.For desserts: The white cake is a disaster-much to dry. The apple pie is okay. The chocolate desserts come out better.For entrees: The cookbook has greater success when the recipes are basic. The risotto is wonderful, very creamy and cheesy. The meatballs came out okay.I wouldn't recommend purchasing this cookbook for a novice cook. There are often difficult-to-find ingredients or unusual preparations."
1,This Is Not Very Good Cookbook - Too Hard,"I prefer the How to Be a Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking, Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook, The Low-Carb Comfort Food Cookbook."
4,Beginners beware...Intermediate have fun!,"Typical of the ""Classroom in a Book"" series, this book is set up as a series of lessons. They take you through the major functions of Illustrator providing both instructional overviews and hands-on exercises. Lessons-wise, I can't fault the authors. They did a bang up job of hitting all of the major functions of the program.I would however like to warn users to realize that this book and the others in the series are really not for beginners. Illustrator like its sister tool Photoshop packs A LOT of functionality. If you are a beginner and you start going through these lessons, you may feel VERY overwhelmed. I strongly suggest beginners start with another perhaps out of the SAMS 24 hrs version. Good intro. Then buy this book and try the lessons. You really need the grounding in the application so you won't feel blown away.I really did like this book, but it is truly for intermediate to advanced users only."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking for a tutorial to get me up and running, and after learning more from the manual than realworld Illustrator, I assumed that Adobe's own book would help me out. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. If anything, this seems like a supplement to the manual, covering in more depth areas that the manual just skims upon. Much of the material seems to be a duplicate of what I've found in the manual as well."
5,As good as usual,"I've read a lot of computer books, and the classroom in a book format is one of the best. If you're unfamiliar with it, it is entirely tutorial based. And excellent. This book includes 15 tutorials, all of which are worthwhile. The amazing part about the book is that is it is easy enough for beginners to follow, while providing plenty of tips, and techniques for the more advanced user. Definately beneficial to beginners and intermediate, and possibly some advanced users too. If you read the book, you'll know the program well."
1,The manual gets smaller,"This is the missing portion. Portions not in the manual get better treatment here. However it appears, because of the tutorial nature of the book, this is not as useful as the manual."
1,Tedious way to learn,"The project and tutorial approach to this book makes it very difficult to actually learn anything about the software. I had hoped to come away with more than just a rudimentary knowledge of the product, but not because of this book."
1,"Looks good, but hard to comprehend","This is a fantastic looking book. However, it is very poorly organized. The one star is for crispness. Unfortunately, I found it to be completely unusable."
1,Good if you've lost the manual.,"This book does a good job of explaining how to use the most basic features of Adobe Illustrator. The author develops the each section in a systematic way. This book is helpful if you are new to the Illustrator environment.However, if you OWN THE MANUAL, unfortunately this book does not add much to what you already know.Users who are looking for more advanced applications or techniques when using Illustrator, this book is not for you.I would have also liked if the author had talked a bit about interactivity with other applications."
1,NOT the book for learning Illustrator,This is basically a re-hashed manual that was barely updated from version eight of IlluStrator.
1,CD Rom Problems-Be Warned!!!,"I bought this book on a Thursday, tried to load the practice files on Friday and they wouldn't load. I called Adobe help, who directed me to PeachPit Press, the makers of the CD. They have a ""get back to you in 24 hours"" policy, which is not very helpful over a weekend I was hoping to study. Monday, I left repeated messages. Finally got a call back Tuesday. A pleasant woman said she would look into it. I have called her repeatedly to get an answer. She explained she had to contact Adobe to work on the problem. I was fortunate that I was able to return the book. As of this day, almost 2 weeks later, no call back as to how to correct this problem. I assume they are still working on it."
5,Love this toy,"My daughter just loves this train. She has taken it apart and put it back together many times, plus she just loves trains. Very durable and colorful. She is just now turning 2 and was about 20 months when I purchased this for her. Great stacking and learning toy. A lot of fun."
3,Melissa & Doug Stacking train,"Disappointed with the track. It was plastic. Grandson called it a baby toy. Had to return itI thought my grandson would love this toy as he is enthrall led with toys but to a 3 year old, it is considered a ""baby"" toy."
2,Falls apart,"My mother in law bought this for my son and within hours it started to fall apart. We took it back, got another one and it did the same thing. The 'pegs' that hold the blocks and locks the train together kept falling off, which I actually found one in my sons mouth! the glue was just not holding up.It was also a real pain because my son couldnt figure out how to stack certain blocks to make it ""look"" like a train. Small detail, but it wasn't worth my trouble to deal with it anymore."
2,poor quality,"Our daughter received this as a gift when she was 18 months old. She loved it and played with it daily on her little play rug. Within a few weeks, the paint was coming off and the wood was pitted. The quality was just terrible. I've noticed every toy she's been given from this brand has the same problem."
3,Fun-ish,"So my 18 month old son loves trains and loves blocks so a blocks train?? Nope. Once out of the original packaging and blocks are off it really doesn't look much like a train again. One of the toys for Christmas he rarely goes back to. May have gone over better if it was a ""just because gift""."
2,not so much fun,"we got this as a christmas present and my 2, 3 and 4 year never really even played with it. I tried I really did because I love anything trains but to no avail then the peices started to come off and in the end it just ended up in a heap with the rest of the blocks."
2,"I like it, but my son never plays with it.","I guess he is spoiled by the ridiculous number of more flashy vehicles (thomas, hot wheels, etc). I, however, enjoy this toy. It is nicely made, has aged well, and looks great sitting uselessly on my sons dresser!"
3,Fun but not durable,"I cannot complain too terribly much because my son who was 16 months when given this toy, has really enjoyed it. HE loves stacking the train into different designs. As the parent I was not impressed with it. It was so cute and fun at first but the paint as rubbed off and chipped. My son is not rough on his toys and it hasn't been thrown or beaten etc. Also the pegs that link the train cars broke and are now lost so we cannot roll the entire train anymore. These damages happened within a month if not sooner. I would recommend finding a different train for your child. I love Melissa and Doug but this was a disappointment."
1,Water Color Paints and Children DO NOT MIX,"This is a nice looking toy - simple - cute. Looks like a great buy for all children. We try to give our son wood toys, because we had simple wood toys and they really are more entertaining that many modern electronic toys. The problem with this train is that the colors are water based, so if you child has any type of moisture on their hands, the colors will start to run. I called the manufacture and they said that this was intended - which does not make sense to me. Why not seal the colors with shellac or similar???Conclusion, do not buy this, unless you are 100% sure that your child will never use the toy with wet hands."
1,Unsafe toy for small children,"This toy came apart in my hands before my daughter even had a chance to play with it. The dowels that are supposed to connect the train parts are not secured and I have had to glue them back in twice. This toy just feels cheaply made and I don't feel safe letting my daughter play with it unless I have my eyes on her at all times. She's also the kind of toddler that runs instead of walking and, therefore, falls a lot so I don't like any toy that has hard wooden exposed pieces sticking out since she could fall on top of them pretty easily. It is now in my donate pile and will go to Goodwill soon.In my opinion, M&D; toys have become very hit and miss recently. We have a M&D; farm puzzle that my daughter and I both love but all of the other M&D; toys I've seen or purchased have not been impressive. This one definitely falls on the disappointing end of the spectrum. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,Losing paint even before first use--skip this toy company,"This is obviously a cute toy, but I would never recommend it to anyone. I gently washed all the parts of this toy before giving it to my child- in warmish water with a mild soap. Even just washing it with my hands (nothing abrasive) caused the paint on all the pieces to peel and flake off. Now I've read other reviews suggesting the toy was actually recalled in Canada because of concerns about its barium content. I have to say, Melissa and Doug toys are the most common wooden toys I find in my local shops, but they are really poor quality compared to Plan Toys. Also, Plan Toys are made in Thailand from renewable rubber wood. This company seems to have a much stronger eco-conscience than Melissa and Doug, which manufactures their toys in China using crappy quality materials."
1,Parents DO NOT like this toy!,"My 2-yr old received this toy for Christmas, and has only played with it a couple of times. He just dumps all the blocks off the train, then tries to put them back. (If our son gets frustrated, he hands the blocks to us to stack back on the train base.) What my husband and I dislike about this toy is the blocks can only be stacked in a certain order. We feel like this limits our child's creativity. I'm so glad I glanced at Amazon's reviews. THANK YOU to the reviewers who mentioned this toy being recalled in Canada. We will not be keeping it. Luckily this is the first and only toy by M&D our son has ever gotten."
5,perfect present,I purchased this for my 18 month great niece. She spends hours stacking and restacking the blocks in different arrangements. Love it!
5,Great for just-two's,"My kids' dentist has this in the waiting room, and my toddler fell in love with it. Very engaging and challenging for a just-turning-2 lover of puzzles and vehicles! I'm not sure about other commenters' needing to put it together just right-- we have managed a few different configurations, some orderly and some not, and it's fun for my son either way. I can see this being a toy that keeps his interest for a couple of years at least."
4,Great educational toy!,"We gave this to our kids for Christmas, both my 2 and a half year old and my one year old love to play with it. They shapes stack in many ways, great fine motor skills. We also use it for shape and color recognition for my older child.... Love the more classic toys, rather than the junk that is in many stores these days."
4,Classic and durable,"I originally got this for my son's nursery, to be used as a decorative item on a shelf. Needless to say, it doesn't get a lot of ""shelf time"", both of my kids, now 4 and 2, love it!!"
1,"Fun, if you don't mind having your child poke themselves in the eye with a wooden stick","This toy appears fun, until we realized that once all the pieces were taken off all that was left was a wooden platform and 2 sticks to put the pieces on. I watched and saw my daughter smack herself on the face with the sticks inches from her eye. It is also almost impossible to do once all of the pieces have been taken off. I have to rearrange to try to get the thing back together again. I don't know how they expect a 2 or 3 year old to do it. I thought maybe it was because sometimes adults aren't always willing to let themselves think like a child so I let my 8 year old nephew do it. All of the pieces were taken off and he was pretty annoyed after a brief period of time.It's good construction, I just wouldn't recommend it."
1,TOXIC TOY,"I bought this toy for my little girl last year. I was shocked to find that there had been a recall on it in Canada..they have stricter testing methods than we do in the US.""this train has been recalled in Canada for containing high levels of barium. Apparently barium can cause (according to Health Canada), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and cramps as well as more severe symptoms.""There was also a recall on their geometric stacker.The Melissa and Doug representatives were AWFUL!! The said it was an isolated incident and not a big deal!!! It is dishonest and wrong that they never issued a recall here and there was hardly any information on this recall available. DO NOT BUY THESE TOYS!!!"
1,This train was recalled in Canada - barium,"Thank goodness my sister let me know that this train that we have and loved has been recalled in Canada for containing high levels of barium. Apparently barium can cause (according to Health Canada), "" nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and cramps as well as more severe symptoms.""I've never even heard of barium in toys. I had never been concerned about Melissa and Doug toys until my sister told me that they were all made in China. It isn't made clear that they are and a number of good toy sites (and Whole Foods) sell them. However, since then I have noticed the paint chips off of many of the toys, and I am no longer confident that the paint is completely non-toxic and safe.My daughter has gnawed on this Melissa and Doug toy and many others and it was with sadness yet relief that I have thrown them all out."
1,Really poor quality,After only 1 week of normal child's play - blue parts of this train started to stain my daughter's hands. Also paints is chipping off of several parts of this train.Shouldn't the childn't toy be more durable???
3,Save the picture!,Well we just got rid of the first set I bought at Big Lots when my son got a second set for his birthday. He seems to more into now than last Christmas and I saved the picture that came with it so that *I* can remember how it goes together. I think it's a little frustrating because the pieces HAVE to go just *SO* to make it fit properly.
1,Peeling paint,"My son absolutely loves this train and I did as well until the paint started peeling off of the blocks less than 2 months after getting the train. The train has ended up in my son's mouth and has been wiped clean with a damp cloth once or twice, but I was surprised and disappointed that the paint started peeling off on several pieces. I would have expected a Melissa and Doug toy would have stood up to normal child play and cleaning."
3,M & D Stacking train,"Way too expensive for what you get. I purchased for both of my 13 mo. old nephews. Once they take it apart that's it. No more interest in it. As long as I am there to put it back together so they can take it apart again, it holds their attention. Very safe toy for toddlers.I wish I had spent my money on something with more bells and whistles."
2,Not appropriate for kids who still mouth,"This could be a very fun toy BUT the paint comes off too easily when put into a child's mouth. I worry that by the time the child is old enough to no longer put toys in his/her mouth it will not be interesting. I love the look of Melissa and Doug products but have routinely found that the quality is very very poor. Plan Toys or Haba toys are more expensive but they last, paint rarely (if ever) chips, and can be resold on e-bay or Craigslist. I doubt I will be able to resell this toy."
3,"OK, but..","..When not stacked, the cylindric posts are potentially dangerous, if the child should fall on them. Otherwise, sturdy, non-toxic, great to play with."
2,Better of as decoration,"We've had this train for 12 days and already the paint is chipping off like many of our other Melissa & Doug toys. M&D; toys are Made in China, supposedly in a responsible factory. However, there have been recalls on M&D; toys issued in other countries that have not been issues in the U.S. Due to this I am hesitant to let my son play with this toy as the paint is chipping off and this has been minimally played with in the less than two weeks we've had it. For now it will go on a shelf and serve as decoration.This is even more disappointing since I had to take my son's other sorting train (Toys R Us Imaginarium brand) away after it broke the day after he received it.As a substitute I will consider the Plan Toys sorting train, which is made in Thailand using abandoned rubberwood. We have several Plan Toys that have look brand new after a year or more of use."
5,Finley's Dynasty Swings Again,"This book is an updated and expanded version of the original book, which came out in 1998 and won the Seymour Medal from the Society for American Baseball Research as the best baseball book of the year.I like this new edition (A Baseball Dynasty: Charlie Finley's Swingin' A's) better, since there is quite a bit of added material. It includes some headlines from the early 1970s, giving the reader a bit more flavor from that tumultuous decade. There are statistical tables on each of the A's' seasons from 1971 to 1975. And there is new interview material with Joe Rudi and Blue Moon Odom that was not included in the first edition. Also, a better title and a better cover, featuring reproductions of some classic Topps baseball cards from the 1970s. There's a 1974 Topps card of Catfish Hunter, a 1972 Topps card of Mudcat Grant (with those mutton-chop sideburns) and 1973 Topps cards of Reggie Jackson and Rollie Fingers. Good stuff."
2,A Drudgingly Boring Book on A Very Exciting Team,"When I picked up this book, I thoroughly expected it to be full of anecdotes about one of the most exciting teams and eccentric owners of all time. What I got was much less. Basically, this book rehashes the box scores and quotations of the time...and adds little else.Not only that...there are typos galore.If you idea of fun reading is statistics in paragraph form....go for it. I prefer something a little less boring."
2,Bland Liz,"Liz Carroll is a wonderful fiddler and a generally fine composer of Celtic tunes, but I don't think she's at her best on this album. There's just something missing here, it's all rather bland, with each track sounding pretty much the same as the next. If you want more variety, my suggestion is to leave this one, perhaps try her ""Lost In The Loop"" album. I think it's much better. Or for very creative other modern day Celtic fiddling, try Catriona MacDonald ""Bold"" or Eileen Ivers' earlier albums (before she got a bit too rocky)."
1,It's Not All There,"Okay we've all received toys that have needed batteries; or have been given toys for our kids that are gifts, and the giver forgot to include batteries. This toys doesn't say anywhere in the description before ordering that you need a controller that isn't included in the box. How frustrating to have your child open a toy on his birthday and not be able to play with it. Not just because he didn't have batteries. There's NO CONTROLLER! Buyer beware you need to have a starter kit that has a control deck and remote before buying this item."
1,ripoff supreme,"kid gets xmas presentwow looks cool!what no control!or batterybattery doesnt matter, not possible to run RC unitswith out controllerafter paying expensive pricetinkertoys just as useful and CHEAPER!(...)"
3,Impossible,This puzzle is simply impossible. It easily becomes a chore after a while... only recommended for those who enjoy extremely challenging puzzles. Definitely would not recommend for kids.
5,"Wonderful, fun puzzle!","This puzzle is great but requires a lot of patience. You have to get up really close to the puzzle in order to put it together but looking at the little scenes keep it interesting. If you love puzzles as much as I do, and a good challenge, this is great! (...)"
1,Drive yourself nuts,"This puzzle isn't difficult its impossible. We started it in January and now its July and guess what, its not finished and nobody cares. Its gathering dust we're too bored with it even to throw it away."
3,Nice little book on TJ's foreign policy views(pro Jefferson),"Kaplan clearly likes Jefferson. His recounting of Jefferson's foreign policy tend to give Jefferson the benefit of the doubt. This book is very informational and fairly short at around 200 pages. I harbor many Jeffersonian ideological thoughts, however, I'd have preferred Kaplan to be a bit more critical of some of Jefferson's actions. Even so, the book still stands out as a good survey of Jefferson's foreign policy. 3 stars for a good book- but not exceptional."
2,Not compatible,"This camera doesn't work with AOL IM v.5.9 on Windows XP. Since AIM is the only Windows IM that communicates with iChat, you won't be able to contact your Mac OS X using buddies if you buy this camera.The cam does work with MSN Instant Messenger (tested with v7.5 on WinXP).Don't expect to be able to move around (e.g dance on the spot :-) while using this camera; the sensor is quite slow and you'll be a blur if you even wave your head from side to side.OTOH, it's a lot cheaper than some other cameras!"
4,Excellent yet verbose,"I enjoyed this book enormously, with its seemingly endless stream of new concepts that defy political correctness and conventional wisdom, and its ability to explain some of the aspects of our mind and culture that so far have been harder to comprehend. It is also often quite funny, and the fake interview with the bower bird made me laugh out loud. However the ideas are often somewhat half-baked and less-than-half proven. Although it is more of a popular science than a scholarly book, I missed the notes and references. And I believe that it would greatly benefit from some editorial pruning, as the arguments are often repetitive; a truly great 200-page book is hidden inside this excellent 500-pager"
4,E X C E L L A N T O O O O O,I found the reading very helpful in terms of shaping the human basic desires. The author is evidently knowledgable in his field of work. The book also explined as to why some of my female friends have odd mood swings and their choice of 'unusual' partners. Overall a jewel!
2,"entertaining and chatty, not scientific","This is a reasonably fun light read which would have improved if it had been edited.As with many American popular science books, the first third is perhaps worth reading if you're fast, the second third is barely OK, and the last third seems to have gone directly from a first draft written in a word processor to the printed page.The premise is entertaining- that human intelligence might have evolved as a sexual display - but it's not well supported by evidence. To be fair, the author points this out occasionally in the first third of the book.I only save books I might like to read or refer to again. This one ended up directly in the wastebasket."
2,Some Credibility Checks On An Active Imagination,"This young, obviously learned author has really ""pushed the envelope"" with his radically reductive explanations of human nature, and human behavior. Perhaps the time is ripe for an astute application of Sir Karl Popper's ""falsifiability criterion,"" in order to restore some balance to an otherwise very creative account; for while creativity and imagination are essential to the advancement of science (or any other human endeavor), so is rigor. On the humorous side, I don't recommend that ""dashing young suitors"" share the underlying philosophy of human beings contained in this book with their favorite girlfriend--even if they privately believe it. Otherwise, they may find themselves ""standing in the rain"" and, literally, out of the gene pool. The ""Queen of Hearts"" can surely see and will usually prefer a heart in her ""Gentleman."" And it's still true that the heart knows things that reason (or scientistic materialism) knows nothing about (Blaise Pascal)."
5,Great computer :),"I've had it for 6 years and it still works great. :) I spent a little on a better video card so I could play more up-to-date video games on it, but havent had any complaints."
1,I would rather have an enema.,"We bought a Gateway and Windows got hosed for some reason. We called 1-800-GATEWAY for support. Guess what? If you buy a Gateway anywhere but their website you must call a separate toll number. WTF!? Then we needed to restore it but the restore partition was bad. Had to get the recovery disk. They charged me $20 for a $1 CD-R. Then it wouldn't work, and they wanted to charge me to tell me how to use it. Again WTF? These people are horrible. Save yourself a lot of trouble and get a Mac. Get HP. Get an abacus. Anything but a Gateway."
4,Painfully spectacular,"I just love Kevin Rowland. He took some very crappy/sappy/goofy songs and made them interesting and put a lot of feeling into them. It slightly disturbs me that he would listen to most of the songs on this CD, much less find them life altering, but this proves that I would love anything he sings."
3,More for Isuzu Cars than Utility Vehicles,I am giving it three stars because I have a 1988 Izusu Trooper. This book contains more information on the Isuzu cars and doesn't give enough info on the trucks. I have ordered the Chilton's Isuzu Amigo/Pick-Ups/Rodeo/Trooper Repair Manual. Hopefully that will be better. If you have an Isuzu car. You might find this more usefull.
4,Book Review--Blood Type A Food lists,A very informative list of good and bad foods to support a healthier diet for those who have type A blood.
4,Interesting,This book proposes a theory and then solidifies the position with historical information. Worth reading and giving thought to why we eat the foods we do.
2,No weight loss,I tried this book because I was sick of being over weight and having so many pains and aces.I had just reached the big 50 and heard about this book. Well I went & got my blood group & followed the book to the later.I felt slimmerbut I have lost no weight . After 8 weeks of giving up all my favourite foods. I am still a big fat whaleBut I do fit into my cloths better.D
5,My little mini-food bible,"I purchased this book after reading about blood type diets. I can honestly say I never go anywhere without it. If I adhere to the food lists in this handbook I feel more energized, healthy and well. But if I stray I do notice things I never noticed before. It is an amazing thing that our blood type can cause us to metabolize our food differently, but it is REAL and it does make a huge difference. If we all followed our blood type diet then perhaps we wouldn't be plagued with diseases, obesity, and other ailments that could be related to our eating improperly."
4,"Blood Type A - Food, Bev & Suppl;ement Lists from Eat Right for your Type","I thought the book would be a little bigger, but overall it is ok. I might have to purchase the larger book from this author. I just wish the shipping wasn't so high."
2,too exspensive,Very small book.After adding postage $5.99 it was much too exspensive.The book itself was OK and you could get most of the information you need to follow the diet.If you wanted a lot of detailed information you would need to purchase one of the larger books.
3,Pleased so far...,"I ordered this book because some of my co-workers are on this diet. So far, I have replaced several major food items the book suggested I stop eating with other foods. I actually have lost weight and have more energy. I will continue to do so with other foods.I think this diet worth considering, especially by those with allergies as I have. I'm hoping for a long-term solution and am keeping an open mind that this will help."
5,Lots of info in a small package,"This little book is jam packed with info on what foods are beneficial to those with Type A blood. After reading the huge, complete ""Eat Right 4 Your Type"" book, this is just the portable reminder I need to help keep track of what foods (and how much) will enable me to gain and retain your health."
2,Hmm,Not sure that the facts behind this information can truly be substantiated as each person is uniquely different. Didn't really see much improvement.
3,Thought provoking,Very thought provoking. Very true to my personal blood type. I like Peter's concept I think they are well researched and have good execution. I still believe to a certain extent it is a fad diet but there are some absolute truths to his claims. Being blood type A myself I would never be able to stick to a vegetarian based diet. Soo I think read it and do what works for you.
3,Not what I expected,The book is very small and not at all what I expected. The quality of the book is subpar and looks as though it was printed as a leaflet. The price is also inflated as I would expect this product to only be worth $5 to $6.
3,Good I guess,"I was hoping to not have to buy the entire book to get more information on my own Blood Type...so this book kind of sucked on that level. Still good, I guess..."
4,Blood Type A,Incredibly useful. Makes you want to learn more about eating properly for one's blood type. I passed the information along to several family members.
2,Not in good physical condition,"The contents of the book are ok, but the physical condition of the paperback was less then desirable. I am glad that I did not spend a lot of money on it."
5,Type A,you can carry this book with you everywhere. it is a quick reference and small enough to carry with you. easy read
1,Stay away,"In the 30-45 minutes it took me to read this book I was so surprised, about how such an unscientific hypothesis can be popular. I regret now having spent the 8 dollars for the kindle edition and the time spent. I feel obliged to give it 1 star it should have been minus, to counteract, all these fake 5 star reviews. The book explains nothing and doesn't have a single argument about anything. Such a waste."
5,Intimate CD with passion and beauty,"If you've never experienced Denny Jiosa, this is a good one to start with. He has 5 or 6 CDs that just blow me away. His choice of material and originals lead you through a great musical journey. He is a rising star...his guitar is sweet, yet cutting and clear. the production on all his albums is perfect. Buy it, and his others...spread the word."
5,How I see it:,Items delivered in condition and on time as promised; unfortunately one broke in my old VHS player. thank you for good service.
3,Actually works,"The video must've been made it the 80s, so its a bit old-skool. Even so, it works. You have to keep practicing, but after I watched the video once, I found myself finishing my books WAAAAAAAY quicker."
5,ClaireD is an idiot,"don't get me wrong, i respect everyone's opinion. but get your facts straight before you write a review. mason jennings came BEFORE jack johnson. mr. johnson is copying mr. jennings, and with much less creativity i might add. but then, that's just MY opinion. oh, and buy this album, it's great."
1,"If you like this, you like nothing good...","Overall this cd was just a cheap attempt to act like Jack Johnson, or any other simplistic, lazy, drawling person who wants to sing about the California Oceanside. The things that he sings about is repititious and redundant, with his voice being out of key and overall horrible. ""Butterfly"" has to be the worst song ever out of the whole group due to how short it was, out of key, and it didn't get anywhere. I would not mind it so much if it was good, but it's not. It's horrible and I reccommend Jack Johnson if you are into this sort of thing."
4,I like him,"I just bought this disc, but I think it's safe to say that it's a keeper. Listen to Amazon's sound clips- you'll know pretty quickly if this is for you. My only obvious complaint has to do with the quick running time- this disc runs at just 26 minutes."
3,Good book from Amazon,"..I bought 2 books on Amazon this one and Car Accident Secrets Vol 1.5 - Both books helped me solve my accident/personal injury.I recommend both books as they are well written, easy to follow and helped me save alot of money from my claim. Both books are recommended if you are trying to settle a claim by yourself without using an attorney. The books helped me to save over 8000 dollars on my car accident/personal injury claim."
4,Good book for the legally challenged!,"This is a good beginner book. Would recommend this book to anyone who is legally challenged. This book is very basic, easy to understand, however it doesn't get too indepth. The reader who is expecting a great amount of detail will be disappointed."
1,"This book is about managing a lawyer, not DIY.",This book is definitely not a book for the do it yourself legal person. It is a book length sales pitch about why you need a lawyer and what to do with one once you have one. It's a well written book with lots of information but it is not what it is billed to be.
5,Never too old for cartoons!,"I may be considered too old (20) for kids TV, but hey, I say I'm in touch with my inner child. Ever since transformers, the cartoon world has been waiting for something to match it. At last Pokemon arrived! Its screenings on ITV (UK) got me and my housemates out of bed and into the living room at 9:30 every Saurday morning. This set is the perfect way to begin your Pokemon collection, chronicling the beginning of the adventures. I have to say I'm not such a fan of graphic novels, but the videos and the swanky case make this well worth the money. So go on; discover your inner child and take this ideal first step towards catching 'em all!"
3,Interesting but dated,"My current Ti89 Calculator is more complex, powerful and useful than Mr Duffet's PC, when he wrote this book. I bought this book more for its interest, than for seriously calculating complex equations. The book certainly met my expectations - it was fun, informative and had great examples. The only downside is that is tremendously out-of-date, and assumes my calculator to be of the pocket, standard variety. That said, if you're interested in simplifying astronomical calculations to the extent that you need a simple pocket calculator, then this is the book to get. However, you'd be better off with Jean Meeus' excellent series."
3,Not one of my favorites,"I use Philosophy Lip Shine exclusively and have loved them all, but this one is not one I'd buy again. I've been using it for a few days and trying to figure out what it tastes like. It finally came to me that it tastes like orange juice that is a little too old, if you know what that is like. I wish it had a fresher orange flavor. The color is nice though, so I'll keep using it until it's gone."
4,Candy Watermelon Lip Shine,"Nice candy watermelon flavor and scent - reminds me of the watermelon bubbleyum gum or jolly rancher candy. Nice light color with shine. Not really sure why it's called melon daiquiri, but a nice lip gloss."
2,Very pretty; horrible taste,"I got this as a gift. I love the look of it on the lips- a pretty pink shimmery shade, a little on the coral side. Great for summer. But the taste and smell is pure melon. Fine, if you like that. I happen to hate all melon but canteloupe, and this smells like a combo of honeydew and watermelon. I gave it away, which was a shame, but the odor turned my stomach. It was long-lasting and was a nice, BIG tube- I despised that I couldn't use it. Just be sure, if you're giving this as a gift (or any other flavored philosophy Lip Shine) that you're getting a fragrance/taste that your giftee likes, b/c this is STRONG."
4,Very Tasty for You and Him,"Very tasty and flavorful! Looks great on the lips, not too much sparkle but is a bit thicker than anticipated in consistancy."
1,if you like glue...,"What an overpriced sticky mess! This product does smell wonderful and glides on smoothly, but makes my lips feel like they're glued shut. Also, if a piece of your hair lands on it - it will stay there! Don't waste $10 on this thick goo."
4,Wish it lasted longer,Wonderful mint smell and makes my lips feel good. A little sticky but sticky makes it stay. Wish it lasted longer.
5,Great addition if you have the room,"Be carefull this is an addon set, you will find many negative reviews on amazon about Rokenbock. Dont let tehm bother you!!Do your research as Rockenbock is a building set that REQUIRES a starter pack, one you understand and purchase a starter set first you and your child will have loads of fun..My only compaint about the monirail it that is takes up alot of room.. I think you need at least a 5 x 6 area to play well with any opf the rockenbock toys. Also this is something that needs to be left out or in major peices, you wont want to keep builinding it each day to play with it.. it will loose its fun if you have to take it down each day."
5,Great Monthly Planner!,"Using this planner for college homework and event planning. Love it! But I will probably order the bigger version next time (need more space to write in). Durable, clear, easy to plan in... Love it!"
4,Good if you like a medium size monthly planner,"My monthly planner looks almost like the picture you see here. The difference is mine came with a big sticker advertisement that covers most of the front cover. This sticker is awfully difficult to get off. I tend to peel small parts of it off while on the phone.Nevertheless, I think you'll like this item if using monthly calendars suit your personal style. I always liked them because I don't want to write much detail on each day. It doesn't bother me that last December and next January aren't included because the new one is always out well enough in advance.The dimensions are smaller than any monthly calendar I had in the past. This would be a good thing if I carried it around with me, but I only use this at my desk at work."
2,The price does not equal the value derived.,"The product, put simply, is not worth the price tag. Spend the extra 5-10.00 and get a planner that is more than a photocopied and collated calendar book."
5,My favorite independent movie this year!,"This movie premiered in Houston, TX at the Alamo Drafthouse Theatre. It was sold out, but I was able to get a last minute ticket. I really enjoyed the movie, acting caught you from the moment the movie started, the cinematography is like a big budget movie and the story has many twists and turns. A great supernatural thriller."
5,Hell of a Film,"Backroad is one of those movies that makes you extremely uncomfortable in a all the right ways. Definite must see, the cinematography in the first 3 or 4 minute alone is gorgeously disturbing but not in the torture porn way. This is definitely a cerebral film that begs for a second and third view, and something new will strike you with each pass. If you like your horror to screw with your head more than your stomach I HIGHLY recommend Mr. Slaten's Backroad."
3,late bloomer,"After one half hour of watching there was still no action and nothing but a few stilted conversations. And this in a set labeled as ""EXTREME HORROR"". But it improves with time."
4,Houston's Got Talent,This simple film has twist and turns that well keep you on the edge of your seat. The actors are spot on and the directing and cinematography is breath-taking. A Must SEE Movie!!
3,What's Wrong,"The problem with these recordings is that the orchestra is playing in a spacious hall while Caruso was jammed up against the recording horn.On the CD ""Italian Songs"" which was done next in this series, this is corrected and that what makes that CD sound much more realistic and makes it a real joy.I only wish they'd go back to putting a little ""space"" on Caruso's voice on this album; it should be matched up to the orchestra this way; do that and this CD would handily rate five stars."
1,Simply Disgraceful,"What they have done to Caruso's voice for the sake of fitting his voice to the modern orchestration is simply disgraceful and offensive. The producers of this CD clearly must have assumed that anyone listening to it, would not have heard the original recordings on '78. But I have--all of arias compiled on the CD. And the Caruso voice is so distorted in most of the arias that it is almost unrecognizable. It is as though the producers sped up or slowed down the tempos of the Caruso original recordings to best fit the orchestration. If you want to hear Caruso's voice as it really sounded, don't buy this CD. Stick to the original '78's."
2,It is a story of a family after the son died,"I don't want to speak ill of anyone. It is tragic that Nicholas died from the shooting. But I don't see why it generated so much fuss. Or he even received awards. It was a book about the events that followed nocholas's death. I thought there was something inspiring there. But to be honest the only thing i saw was the couples seemed to handle the grief well.But it was a book with too much "" nice"" in it. Like my mom was the nicest person, my first wife was great. Like Nicholas was the most wonderful little boy. My wife was remarkable. So was her list of highly accomplished relatives. It just all seems too unreal. I would have thought there were more struggles to coming to terms with the event."
2,This [was not good],"This puzzle was so difficult to do. It still isnt put together either, I gave up."
1,Don't BUY IT.,Cheap materials. Cheaply made. It came damaged (dented) in the box. Not worth $.50.This case provides very little protection for your weapon.
1,PT students--don't waste your money!!,"This book is not worth your well-earned dollars... the tests included many incorrect answers in the answer keys, duplicated questions from test to test (of which answers varied from test to test--some right/some wrong), plus no rationales for the answers to the questions."
2,Preparing for the Physical Therapy Licensure Exam,"While this book did help direct my thinking in studying for the board exam, I found there were many questions that had mistakes and the answers provided inaccurate information. I also was unable to download the sample tests on the enclosed disc, maybe because my computer operates with Windows 98. It was frusterating not to have the practice."
1,Preparing for the Physical Therapist Licensure Exam,"I did not think this book was very helpful. The sample test are nothing like the actual exam. I feel this is misleading. I also noted conflicting information throughout the book. However, the questions on the disk were more accurate. I would not recommend this book to anyone!!!"
1,Preparing for the PT licensure exam,I recently took the PT exam and found that this book did not help me one bit. Not one question on the exam was similar to any of the questions found in this book. The disk did not work on my computer. I found several discrepancies and wrong answers. Totally worthless book and waste of money.
2,Unfulfilled potential,"This book has the right idea-practice questions. It is stuffed full of questions which is great practice; however, it has no other asset. It does provide test answers, but not explanations. There is a HEAVY emphasis on PNF, Brunnstrom, terminology and Medical Science. Also, I found at least 1 question that was repeated twice in the same chapter."
2,Disappointed,"Let me start with the down side of this disc. First it is listed as 60 minutes, alas the only way you'll get 60 minutes of viewing out this is to either watch it twice or spend 30 minutes looking for the other 30 minutes.On the plus side the color was great, and the sound as good as could be expected for 40 to 50 year old material. There was even some footage of Eisenhower viewing his steamer when it came stateside.What there was of this DVD was OK, but only if you are one who finds most anything on a flanged wheel fascinating.The bonus material pages are only 1 page of text for each option, and the trivia game has debatable answers.I expected much more and am sure glad I rented before purchasing."
1,Dont buy,"The skin is pretty cool, the plastic screen protector does not stay on, perhaps because the skin is too tight for the ZEN. It is so tight, in fact, it depresses the buttons. It's not worth buying despite the price, I would venture elsewhere."
3,"Silicon case is ok, but the plastic window is a danger for your screen","Needed a case for my creative zen vision M (30 gig). This case does the trick. The belt strap is cheap but it didn't show any sign of breaking so far. BE WARNED that the plastic window does more harm than good. The silicon case is tight on my Zen, but it's still a bit floating inside and whenever it moves with the plastic screen, It scratches the MP3 player's screen rather deeply. I RECOMMEND THE CASE BUT DO NOT PUT THE PLASTIC WINDOW FOR THE SAKE OF KEEPING YOUR SCREEN SCRATCH FREE."
2,Be careful for the plastic cover,"I bought this case for my vision m 30gb because I didn't want it to get scratched up. First of all it's a pretty nice case the only problem is, the plastic cover that protects the screen rubs against the screen and scratches it up. Now I have to figure out how to get rid of all the scratches. I don't believe it's just this case I think it's all the silicone cases that have the plastic cover. Now I'm looking into buying a plastic case."
1,Save your money,"I bought this item in August of this year. It lasted around 30 days. After that when I turned it on it would not cool.On the average I used it about 3 hrs a day.I've had thermoelectric coolers for years and never had one fail. Maybe I got the one in a hundred that had a poor circuit.Whatever, stay away from this item."
4,Cool Pool,"I received this pool quickly and in time for a heat wave. Unfortunately, after inflating and filling with water, I noticed one side was lower than the other. Then, the bottom deflated and the sides quickly followed. I was totally bummed out! I was able to return it and was sent a new one, which was a terrific plus. I hope the next one lasts longer than 1 day! Otherwise, I think this is a great pool and it's perfect for cooling off after a hot day. Thanks, Amazon, for making the return and replacement so easy."
1,"NO DRAIN PLUG, BEWARE...","I ordered this pool 2x thinking they sent me the wrong pool the first time. Nope, both were the same identical pools that said there was a DRAIN PLUG on line but, there was NO Drain Plug and it did not say it on the box. I waited 2 weeks for the 1st pool then another week for the 2nd pool. Summer is almost over and, my 4 yr old twins DO NOT HAVE A BACKYARD POOL."
1,Do Not Purchase,I am very disappointed that you have to deflate the pool everytime you have to drain the water out. Then you have to inflate it everytime you want to use it. Who has time to inflate and deflate a pool. There should be a drain valve in the bottom of the pool so the water can drain out and this way you dont have to deflate the pool. Not recommended.
2,Has the potential to be a great product,"Ours unfortunately arrived with some sort of leak, somewhere. We were never able to find it on a busy 3-day weekend, but it had to be pumped up with an electric pump at least hourly to avoid losing all of the are and so, all of the water.So, all in all, it was a HUGE waste of water for us and a major source of stress and annoyance on what should have been a nice relaxing weekend. From now on, we'll buy our pools locally so that we can easily return them if they are defective. I ended up driving to Target to get another pool for the kids."
4,Great Pool,"We like this pool a lot, my kids, ages 2 and 5, have a lot of fun in it. I liked the inflatable floor, because I am keeping it on the patio on the hard cement. The only thing about that, is my 2 yr old loses his balance trying to walk on this floor (its got big bumps). I only gave it 4 stars on durability, because I am having issues with it being a bit lopsided. It doesn't inhibit our use of the pool, but its just sort of an annoyance. Otherwise, its seems to be holding up just fine, however we haven't had it for very long, so time will tell on that aspect."
4,Great pool,"Very roomy. We have used this for two summers now and my daughter (now 3) loves it. It is big enough for an adult to sit comfortably with their children. Only negative is trying to drain it, which you have to do after each use"
1,FALSE ADVERTISING AMAZON NEEDS TO FIX DESCRIPTION,I UNFORTUNATELY NEEDED TO BUY A POOL VERY QUICKLY AND DID NOT READ REVIEWS UNTIL AFTER WE INFLATED IT AND NOTICED THERE IS NO DRAIN. IS THIS AMAZONS FAULT FOR FALSE ADVERTISEMENT? I WOULD HAVE NEVER PAID 45 DOLLARS FOR A POOL THAT I HAD TO DEFLATE EVERY NIGHT TO REMOVE THE WATER. HAS ANYONE GOTTEN A REFUND OR FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DRAIN POOL WITHOUT DEFLATING.I READ EVERY DESCRIPTION TO MAKE SURE TO PICK A POOL WITH A DRAIN AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY PURCHASE AND CLEARLY FALSE ADVERTISEMENT ON AMAZONS AND CMS'S BEHALF.
4,Not what I was expecting,"One sure thing about the author is the deep knowledge he has on the subject. But the way the book is presented, developing a subject -like the chapter about flora and fauna- makes the reading a little difficult since you see lots of names and short stories related to that. I was expecting a chronological story, my fault then."
2,Acceptable but superficial,"This is a survey of the Portuguese Empire to the 19th century. It is perfectly adequate but its broad strokes make it relatively superficial. I suspect it is basically Russell-Wood's notes for his lectures at Johns Hopkins, not a original piece of research. I regard Malyn Newitt's volume on the Portuguese Empire much superior."
2,Another let down series that gives us only radio edits!!!,"there are SO many freestyle collections that have a GREAT selection of the hottest songs and aritsts of the era...but almost all seem to forget that these were CLUB HITS, and that having the EXTENDED versions was crucial. I'm so glad to find some rareties on here, but most tracks run less than 5 minutes. The only exceptions are ""Clave Rocks"" and ""My Heart Gets All the Breaks"" , both of which run (5:15). Also, ""My Heart's Divided"" by Shannon is not the original version, but an edit of the 12"" mix, running about 27 seconds shorter.For the casual fan this is great, for hardcore dance collectors, it's disappointing."
5,don't be afraid,"Don't be afraid to look into the lion. This is Shapiro at his best! You MUST read this book, and read it often!"
4,Great shader brush!!!,"I did not buy the brush from this site b/c luckily my local beauty supply store carries it so I can avoid the excessive shipping costs... But it is a really great shader brush. The bristles are incredibly soft, it picks up color very well and allows you to pack it on to your lid for maximum intensity!!! I DEFINITELY recommend this brush!!!"
5,One of the best Daphnis Discs,"I'm another one of those fanatics who has owned or heard dozens of recordings of this piece, so hopefully that at least qualifies me to write this review! Up to now, my favorite digital recording of this work wasMaurice Ravel: Daphnis et Chloé / La Valse - Berliner Philharmoniker / Pierre Boulezwhich is excellent in every way. It is now a toss up. My favorite classic analog recordings are those conducted by MonteuxRavel: Daphnis et Chloé / Rapsodie espagnole / Pavane ~ Monteux, and also Martinon, now available in this set:Ravel: Orchestral Works. You can hear details in the Martinon that are inaudible in most others, and there's something special in the Monteux that makes it unique and indispensable. But this newer disc conducted by Petitgirard is just as good in its own way: a fresh interpretation, vivid digital sound and budget price! Worth purchasing, either for those who are new to the work or fanatical collectors like me!"
3,Useful but erroneous,"Well, to be honest, Physical Chemistry isn't really my interest, but even I could see how the solutions in this book were sometimes flawed or presumptuous. It was a useful tool, but sometimes I didn't understand what in the world the manual was doing. It didn't really improve my understanding of the subject material, it just provided a way to get through the problem."
2,Incorrect Solutions,"Sometimes the solutions are incorrect, or numbers are different in the problems in the textbook compared to the solutions in this solutions manual. Sometimes when showing a solution, big math jumps are taken, and it's difficult to see how to get there in one step. This solutions manual is supposed to be a tool to help understand the difficult subject of physical chemistry, but it sometimes makes everything harder."
3,Helpful but not always,"This solutions manual to THE classic physical chemistry textbook contains quite a few errors and the logical steps are not always clear to many problems contained therein. While has proven its utility to myself in the past and, more recently, many other physical chemistry students, it is not always the final word. Users of this solutions manual should keep a keen eye on numbers and one may have to consult other resources for eductional purposes.."
3,Card games,Had a hard time following and understanding the rules to most of the games in the book. Not for people who only play for fun
3,My dog is tiny,My tiny dog ate them. To be safe I cut them into bit size pieces. She doesn't chew things well.
3,Not a pattern book.....,"This book is not a book for quilters who need templates, but does give 42 black and white picture drawings of vintage quilt designs, and labels the quilts with their respective names. This book was not intended to be an instruction on how to applique, quilt, piece or select fabric, etc; but to provide only the names of various designs."
2,"OK, but not great",I was disappointed in this book. it's not what I was expecting but it is what it said it was...it's just a very short book.
4,Great lockset,"This is a great lock set, we have an older home and the antique brass was a great match with the old hinges, the holes lined up exactly with the existing holes in the door."
2,"OK, but.....","Some useful info but it's absurd that this is a ""2000 edition"" and covers books up to about 1993! What did he do when he updated this book, close his door and stay inside from 1993 to 1999 writing this book, ignoring any books written after 1993? Weird.What boggles my mind is how few books there are on pricing and grading first edition books, and the ones that do exist are not very good, including Aherns. Why can't someone come out with a decent one like they do for comic books (Overstreet, etc)?"
1,Talk about a limited scope!,"I'm not sure exactly how this guy came up with his criteria for what to include in this book and what to leave out. There is no Kurt Vonnegut, no Toni Morrison, no Saul Bellow, and no J.D. Salinger. Morrison and Bellow are both Nobel laureates in ""20th century fiction""! And Salinger's first edition of Catcher in the Rye is probably one of the most sought-after books in this category. On top of this, the book is full of editorial errors. Not worth the trouble."
4,Wonderfully Informative Book,"This book is exactly what I have been looking for. There are so many price guides for other collectibles, but I have never been able to find a guide to fit my book collecting needs. All the titles that I have been wondering about are included."
5,Excellent collection,I have always loved Keith's 98.6 but this collection has more. There are songs I have never heard that are gems. Sugar man and I will always love you are great. Of course 98.6 and an't gonna lie are masterpieces but the rest is Good too. I recommend this collection 100 percent
3,excellent,"The good news is 98.6 is the poppiest song on this. Obviously, Keith was trying to get onto 1967 AM radio, and had all the goods. You were not going to hear this next to King Crimson on the underground station, but that is not where Keith was aiming.These songs are all pop, but feature vibraphones, fleshy arrangements, and unique chord groupings. What Kieth does is take Motown/Gamble and Huff elegance and apply it to white pop. This stuff goes down smooth, not sappy. His songs run rings around contemporaries like Bobby Goldsboro and Gary Pucket.And Keith was a lot hipper than he let on: Jerry Ross produced for him here, and Ross has worked with jazz arranger Stan Kenton--not easy listening by any strech. When Frank Zappa wanted to slick up his sound in the early 70s, Keith was the guy he hired,.Keith may have wrote about being sick, but 98.6 or not, this fever boy knew what he was doing."
5,"CIO Wisdom, Indeed !!","Truly, this is 'CIO Wisdom' - set down by CIOs and IT managers who deal day-to-day with information technology in perhaps the most challenging environment - Silicon Valley itself. As a 42-year veteran of the IT industry, I think this is the first time I've seen so much down-to-earth, practical and useful IT guidance in one place. The chapters are clearly and well-written. The authors get right down to the meat of the subject and provide practical suggestions for improving IT delivery.If the book has a weakness, it is that there is so much specific information here that it will likely take multiple readings to glean all of it.I think this book should be required reading for all CIOs ... and if you really want to start something, get a copy for everyone on your IT staff!"
5,Great source for young professionals,"This book is a great source for younger professionals aspiring to be CIO's and wanting to learn some key lessons before they get there. I'm only getting started in the Information Systems field, and this book was a practical learning tool for the future. The authors have extensive real-world experience, and share the lessons they've learned throughout their careers. I highly recommend this book."
4,CIO Wisdom: Best Practices from Silicon Calley,"The book was very incitefull and was great to get the information from those who live the role every day. I thought that it was interesting to have so many people collaborate on this topic, to give those of us who aspire to be there one day, the real deal on what it's like and how to deal with different situations."
4,CIO Wisdom review,"As with many books that collect articles or papers, the organization is topical not a continuous sequence, although there seems to be some consideration given to precedence of topics.I especially found value in the chapters on Communication, Governance, Architecture, the Value of IT, Metrics and the Cates article regarding Line of Business orientation.There are some inconsistencies between articles, and minor editing errors."
5,Calling all aspiring CIO's,"An excellent read for those IT enthusiasts who aspire to become a CIO. ""CIO Wisdom"" provides insight into the life of a CIO and the challenges facing those who accept the responsibility. Can be used as reference even after reading it from cover to cover. I can't wait to read their sequel."
5,EPIC!!!,"When my aunt got this back when she was still in high school (late 20's now)she never completed it, eventually she lost pieces and it got put back in the box. I saw this puzzle at Walmart the other day and had to get it. Took me about 1 month to complete, and ended up giving it to my aunt for christmas. She was very happy. The puzzle was so fun and beautiful looking I ended up on here to only get another one for me. Highly reccomend if your a Disney-Fanatic like me. Over all the puzzle is made up of tons of little pictures from old Disney classics! (Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp, Cinderella, etc.)"
5,A MUST HAVE!!,"I bought this for my sister and myself to put together. It wasn't too difficult because a detailed poster is included inside with the photomosaic details and so every puzzle piece can be spotted on the poster. Then again, we've done our share of puzzles. Disney fans will love it! It includes a bunch of classic disney movie characters and is very satisfying after completed. It's durable enough to pick up the corners off the table completely.. and it will still stay together (not advised to do so unless you're very careful), but classic enough for the pieces to easily glide into place if it's the right fit. We enjoyed this puzzle very much, and I'm sure you will too!"
3,Mickey Mouse 1000 Pieces,Yeesh! This is the hardest 1000 piece puzzle I've ever completed! It is so difficult to assemble the mosaic of film stills because the usual visual cues used when assembling a puzzle are missing.
3,A little challenging,"I knew when i bought this it would be a little challenging, but wow.Some things i didn't like about this puzzle: the little pictures that make up mickey are duplicates. A lot of them have the same picture four or five times, i assumed that they would have a lot of different pictures from different movies. But there really isn't a large selection that i'd hoped. Also having so many duplicates makes it even more hard to complete. The pictures themselves dont look that clear, a lot of them look kind of blurry and i have i hard time even seeing what the picture is.What would be really helpful is to list the movies that are in the puzzle, because some i do not recognize and i'd like to find out more about them.A big plus is the poster that comes with it. I am actually using it to complete the puzzle by searching out the specific picture."
2,I bought this to use in my classroom,"These stamps were purchased to use in my classroom. On arrival, half seemed to be leaking and the other half dry. I say leaking because they are self inking and the ink was all over the outer covering of the stamp."
2,Disappointed!,"I was disappointed with the EZ Stampers. They seemed to be more for child's play and not teachers. The ink was not bold and seemed to need more ink and I found that the common stampers that I would use, it was just one or two of them and too many of the ones that I probably would not use at all. It would be better it they included an in pad to be used when the ink seems to be fading. Definitely would not purchase again."
4,Love it,I really love this product. I use all the time because it has most of the things you need to tell your students.
5,Great board for learning,"This an excellent board for women, beginning to advanced bodyboarders. This is the perfect size for me and I'm 5'4"". It rides great and the workmanship is good despite being made in China. Very light and handles well on the waves."
5,Aneeded unit,"Mio products are functionally great. The only thing wrong with any Mio Unit, especially the P550 is the battery. The charge life is extremely short. This Charge extender is a time, memory, and frustration relief. Nothing worse than finding you have 5 minuted of battery life left while you are entering notes ant a very important time. This helps"
5,a serious novel with the plotting of a genre piece,"This is really a wonderful book. Merullo manages to give the reader a real multi-dimensional view of all the characters with short chapters from the point of view of practically everyone in the story. At the sametime he creates a plot as complex and exciting as a thriller. In addition he gives a real and complex view of a part of American urban culture that is usually portrayed only as stereotypes. Intellectually, socially, emotionally, it's a hell of a good book."
5,Perfect for a waterbirth,"We purchased this pool to have a home water birth in. It's perfect. Large enough to fit two good sized adults in. It has an inflated bottom for comfort and the sides are high enough to get buoyancy. It also has a drain in the bottom to make emptying it easy. Make sure you check that your space is big enough. It's huge. Afterwards we've used it for the kids and they love it too. I would highly reccomend getting a pump for it though, we used the Coleman Quick Pump."
1,Great birth pool...theoretically,"Bought this for our home birth. One suggestion: TEST RUN. I ordered the pool, a food-grade hose, and adapter from amazon and had them all ready and waiting. To make a long story short, the pool leaked air although we could not ever find a hole, the hose was defective, and we couldn't get the adapter hooked up to the shower or sink...so our daughter was born on our bedroom floor. And my husband was running around frantically trying to find wrenches and teflon tape and instead of supporting me through the contractions. It is a GREAT pool IF it is not defective, as the ""floor"" is inflated so you're not sitting on a hard cold surface while in it and it's a perfect size. But if you are planning a home birth please do a practice run long before the day arrives or you might not have a pool at all!"
2,didn't last very long,"Was very disappointed in this product. Spent a lot of money on this as a ball pit for my young children. It began losing air immediately and within 2 months, the upper ring lost all ability to hold air.Certainly not worth the $50 I spent on it."
5,Wonderful!,"Wonderful pool! Very deep, durable, comfortable and definitely containing a drain plug. Not inflatable without some sort of pump. I used it to help combat the heat wave early this summer and it was perfect. I am a 5'6 adult and it was very spacious."
3,my hub's grandson loved this!,"the size is just right,for a 2 yr old to keep bouncing about,i bought this for my husband's grandson,and he just love this alot.. enjoyed playing with this,of course with water,but after summer,my hub might just fill it with balls.. so its still going to be used."
1,Would not stay inflated,"Was very excited to find a pool with a drain plug, but could not keep this pool inflated, checked every seam, could not find an air leak, very disappointed"
2,Died on us shortly,"Great pool, easy to inflate with a pump. After a month of moderate use started letting air out too slowly for me to even try to look for a problem area. Takes about 2-3 hours for the thing to deflate and let the water out, so forget about trying to listen to the sound of escaping air. Oh, and the drain thing, we had it but it was no use really if the pool is on grass, it just gets blocked and water doesn't come out. Still had to use buckets."
5,Great pool for a great price!,"We bought this pool to labor/birth in for our home birth. In order to rent a birthing pool in our area it would have cost us about $150+, which in my opinion is outrageous for one time of use. Our midwife recommended this pool and was a great decision to purchase it.It was a great pool for the home birth. Inflated easily, sturdy thick walls and floor, filled and contained water with no problem and was simple enough to empty.After a good thorough cleaning our 2 1/2 year old really enjoys having a new pool to play with this summer!"
3,"Good size pool, wish it stayed inflated better","First, I love the padded bottom on the pool. Great for wee ones. That said, after all taking all the trouble to inflate and fill the pool, I'd like for it to be useable for at least a couple of days, but it is so droopy after just a few hours, that the sides start sagging low enough for the water to start flowing out over the top. Added to that, there is already a pinhole leak in the floor after only three uses. Disappointing."
2,Horrible customer service,"We received this pool and blew it up, the next day it was deflated. Blew it up again, deflated again, so at that point I realized there was a hole in it when we got it. Emailed the company 3 times with no response. Finally emailed amazon and then the company emailed me saying they would send me a new one. After a week they said they were going to just refund me. So now we're still stuck with no pool for my kids. I wish they had just refunded me after my first email so I could find a different pool. Toy direct has the worst customer service. Will never order from them again."
4,Nice,This pool is a nice quality and bigger than I thought it would be. Unfortunately my dog jumped in a popped it the 2nd time we used it so I cannot say much else about it. The patching kit was not the best so I would just make sure you get something a little better to patch it with if there is a hole.
1,Pool does NOT have drain plug,"It would seem that a recent change has eliminated the drain plug that is listed as a feature of this pool. My purchase was based on the pool having a drain plug, as that would allow the pool to easily drain with little effort on my part. This is not the case. The product packaging also does not match the shown outside box. Any review prior to 2010 should not be used when considering this product."
3,Decent show. Hate the packaging.,"My boys love the show and watch it regularly. I have already purchased the entire season from a legitimate download store months ago, so I dislike the fact that The entire season will cost $30 list to buy on 3 separate DVDs.The entire season should be available for $20 list, preferably less. The producers appear to be delivering customers to the legal download stores. Good news for the download services, less so for DVD retailers."
3,"Disappointing text, too few but good pictures","I was looking for a comprehensive book with many illustrations on Woodland Indians. This book is definitely comprehensive, and the illustrations carefully done. However, the text is written in cursive (hard on the eyes, and hard for a young reader to read), and there are too few illustrations for my purposes. Still, it is very clear the author is very much an expert on this topic, and he writes clearly."
4,"very good, but a caution","This is a very comprehensive and interesting book, but a caution - unless you are ready to discuss torture, mutilation, and cannibalism with younger readers, you may want to keep this one on a higher shelf. The subjects are treated in a matter of fact manner and there are some illustrations to accompany (not terribly graphic, but there is frontal nudity). This occurs on two pages that I found. If using this with younger folks, you may consider extracting pages of interest. Not condemning, just informing."
3,very mild,"Taste OK. Very mild and it is sort of creamy as stated. Price wise, it is $2.09 per bottle at my local Walmart. Not a big saving to buy the whole dozen."
2,Not what it claims to be.,"Despite the title, this book is not a manual of techniques for casting bronze. It does provide a some good information about sculpting a model and preparing it for casting, though. If that's what you are interested in, then this book is worth reading. However, it provides very little information on the casting process itself. As the earlier reviewer said, it doesn't go much beyond ""take it to a foundry""."
3,Little Mermaid,"I found this an odd game to like as I wasn't a fan of Disney princesses or prince or whatever. I was an on the farm tomboy who'd rather have a pretend dogfight with my toy planes, play legos, and cars. Why I liked this game I never understood. Neither did my little brother. But I think I got all the way to the end. It was one of the few games I'd spend hours and hours trying to beat. ( I chose this over Bill & Ted's Excellent adventure which I was obsessed over...I liked weird movies what can I say?)I doubt everyone will find this game interesting that way, but I did. I liked the way the Mermaid Ariel shot at things. She didn't have a gun in her odd collections of many things. Maybe I liked it because it was one of the few games we own which seemed to emulate the characters on the movie. The movie, which I didn't get, and I didn't like either. Except for the keep singing part which I kind of liked. And Sebastian, he was coolest always worried about everything."
2,Mediocre,"The Little Mermaid for the GB is a very average game. In this game, you go through sidescrolling levels with some up and down movement. You can use shells to open boxes and kill enemies. There are powerups that you can use to defeat enemies. You use bubbles to trap enemies in the game. It is extremely easy to beat. The graphics are pretty good for a Gameboy game. The sound effects are average with nothing special about them. This is a very mediocre game with nothing special or overly bad about it."
1,KIDS FLOP!,"Stop making these CDs! They suck! The kids singing these are butchering good music! Wait a minute, did I say SINGING? This is hardly considered that. Why allow a bunch of annoying little brats (who haven't even hit puberty yet) to release their own Cd?! Seriously, just let kids Bop die!"
2,Really Corny.,"This CD is well, HORRIBLE. I gave it an extra star because it has a good song collection, but I wouldn't waste money listening to songs with annoying kids singing along. ""Kidz Bop"" sure knows how to kill a good song. The bottom line is don't buy this CD."
1,Once again THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!,I just reviewed the other cd and like i said its a waste of your money. Save your money for something valueable.
2,Bleh,"Please note I'm in the age demographic of this tape. But I didn't enjoy this at all. The singing isn't good, and I didn't sing along to a sing one. Aside from lyrics that would be catchy if they were sung by the original artists, I can't really think of anything good about this CD. -.-"
5,The only CD I listen to,I am a 4th grader who loved the CD. My favorite song was Kryptonite because it was great to listen to. All the tracks were good for my age group even though the words were hard to memorize. The kids that sang on the CD did a fantastic job.
2,Horrible Singers,These kids can not sing at all.My friend bought this album.I went over to his house we listened to it.I thought there was something wrong with the CD player.I tried mine.It sounded the same.If you don't want kids that have terrible voices.I recommend Now That's What I Call Music or Totally Hits
1,"This is diametrically opposed to Kidz Bop1, don't buy it!","Both my kids and I loved Kidz Bop1. This CD was a complete disappointment to my kids and I. It's painful to listen to. Only a couple of songs, such as Kryptonite are done to any of the old Kidz Bop1 standards. The rest of the songs sould like they were done in someone's basement using a Casio keyboard. Buy Kids Bop1, but when you do, notice how the songs sort of sound like the originals. With Kids Bop2, the songs don't even come close. It sounds like there are only 3 or 4 different vocalists trying (operative word) to sing the songs. The worst is the Monkees remake 'Im A Believer'. This CD set is horrific and my kids don't like it. There are also a lot of R&B songs which should not be on a kids CD such as 'Survivor' which talks about surviving a divorce. Take my advice and stay away from this at all costs. Of course, as a legal disclaimer, this is only my opinion."
1,Worse that junk food for kids ears...,"Letting your kids listen to this totally inappropriate music, VERY BADLY reproduced with untalented kids singing with untalented adults, is bad parenting. They might actually like it. But they're too young for these lyrics. You're the parent. Make the right choices for your kids and spare yourself the agony of having to listen to this."
1,This ...,"I also wish there was a zero stars...i just cant believe that these kids...would try to even compare with any of the real artists...they sound fake, and teeny bopper, i bet they were like, abused, to do this project! Its JonBenetRamsey times 10...do not buy this cd, for even a penny...trust me...children will hate it, and you! This is from a kid that knows...dont do it, buy them something from the real artists...not the kids bop kids...i just cant wait to hear...them rap on the 3rd album...after i download it, cuz i will never buy one of these cds EVER AGAIN!"
4,"No, these cd's are ok!","In response to Mike Geary's:I am in total agreeance with you about the content of any music our kids listen to. I thought the same thing you did about these cd's before. But I was afforded an opportunity to listen to the cd before buying it and found that they actually changed a lot of the words to some of the songs so the kids could sing them. I have a 9 year old daughter so I am very picky about what her music choices should be; outside of Disney, these cd's are ok!"
1,No god no,"This is all true.Nothing could compare to the pain that was this cd, when I put this cd in my player the darkness covered the sun the innocent were sautered the people ran mad down the streets but this cd was worse than anything my ear started to bleed and mad I heard a humming sound till I was mute from the terror that is Kidz Bop 3 I idmentally had a bowol movement and I curled up in a fetal positon and asked god to make it stop, I then started to break anything around like a animal intent to make the horror stop I scream for hours, I couldn't hear the music anymore because I lost my hearing but I swear I could still hear every single song every single lyric on. in conclusion A++++ would buy from again."
1,Ugh,"This cd is TERRIBLE! It totally wrecks the actual songs from actual groups and NOT crummy kids just repeating it. A total waste of plastic. I thought it would be great-until the advertisment showed up. Don't wannna waste your money, then don't buy it. I may be twelve, but I know bad music when I hear it. Especially if it's just recorded for kids BY kids."
2,"OK, But...",This stand was inexpensive but it doesn't seem strong enough to hold up the horn without the slide resting on the floor.
3,no more progress?,"This book seems well-written and discusses a fascinating topic, however I'm puzzled that (at least at a cursory review) it seems identical to the 1989 edition save for the additional chapter on the movie Rain Man. Have there really been no further advances in understanding savant syndrome in the last seventeen years?"
3,"Something a little more ""out there""","Nurse with Wound isn't any regular band and they certainly don't strive to sound ""normal."" The songs are long and drawn out, and are sometimes composed of extended periods of the same sound. If you like experimental music that is not like anything you've heard before, then pick up this CD."
5,An album to showcase a young Freddie King,I know this is not a Freddie King album but he does play lead guitar and it sounds great. This is an early and rare King album label release and has the tremelo blues sound of Slim Harpo. Smokey Smothers is a great blues singer and has one of the great guitar players of all time backing him. This is a must have album for any blues fans. This album is only going to get harder and harder to find so do yourself a favor and buy it now.
5,Shear delight,"I have owned several ""Diamond Ice"" products for over fifteen years (7.5 inch, 5 inch, and thinning shears) and all of them have provided me with FLAWLESS performance. Like any good piece of cutlery, these shears require careful cleaning lubrication and storage. These products provide any hair stylist a quality tool at a reasonable price."
3,Taking of Too Much Detail,This book would be great if the authors would have left part of the details out. They should have stuck to the Celestis and future Time Lords. The Eldar Ones was a bit too detailed. Going into so much description of the villans (or what appear to be villans) took away from a better view of the Celestis/Time Lord battle. The details of Mictian were good and the authors should have kept with the imagery throughout.
4,Very Nice!,"I think the prior reviews have summed it up fairly well. I couldn't believe it when I first learned that Yellow had produced another album. It was almost too much waiting for Motion Picture to arrive in the mail. And, for the first time since Baby, when I listed to it, it not only met my expectations, but exceeded them. This is a great album that certainly ranks at the top of Yello's accomplishments. It is techno - but it is more complex and more interesting than most of Yello's other offerings. If you like Yello - you will like this album!!"
5,Looks real! Beautiful poodle!,"This is a beautiful poodle, so incredibly soft. This toy was not purchased for a child, but for my mother who suffers from Alzheimer's. This ""baby"" took the place of her real baby who had to stay at home with my father. Thank you for such a beautiful product, and the fast service was great."
5,FEUDAL FIGHTING,Very enjoyable film which in Hollywood's poetic license of ways was not a bad representation of pre medieval life of pre German life.
3,Beware!!! Reviews not for this artist or album...,"The above reviews are for El Trombon Majadero, not Sacred Rhythms. Totally different albums from different artists. I now have both, since I did not know until after I purchased Sacred Rhythms. I was expecting big, fat, Cuban brass and Sacred Rhythms is definitely not that."
1,Too General,Although well written and made of good quality this book tries to be all things to all people. The author tries to cover every topic in a small book and is unsucessfull. This book spent almost the same amount of time on exterminating rodents and insects as it did on engine maintenance.
4,Delicious and helpful,"Simple recipes, safe for fibromyalgia, (If that's what I have). The introduction, while simple, provided twomajor clues to self-care, and the results strongly suggest that my self-diagnosis was correct. I feel better,and my family likes the dishes.I am a good cook, so when I saw these simple recipes I was not impressed...so many are like things I'm already doing, and are so simple. BUT...each one was delicious, and tho' I frequently think something I've created needs salt, these low-sodium recipes are wonderfully tasty. Instead of being on the cook-book shelf in the pantry,it's taken it's place on my kitchen counter!"
1,not a cookbook for people with fibromyalgia,I bought this book because I wanted to change my eating habits to feel better. But this cookbook was written before the latest findings for people with fibromyalgia to stay away from night-shade foods and dairy products. These recipes contain night-shade foods and dairy products so I did not find this cookbook helpful and was a waste of my money. This book should be updated or taken off the market.
3,Specialized book,"If nutrition is not a major problem for you, the recipes are good. However, if different foods increase your pain, the recipes are not adequate for that problem."
2,Where is the nutritional information?,"This is becoming my ""pet peeve"" when it comes to cookbooks: writers who just pull recipes together with no detailed information about calories, fat, sodium, etc. Granted, this book is not intended for weight loss, but with the overwhelming amount of obesity in the world, nutritional information is now a requirement. Yes, the recipes appear easy to follow and sound delicious...but without the info mentioned above, the book is useless to anyone who has any type of dietary restriction (such as low sodium - which is what I must do). As I've said before, I don't like giving anything less than 5 stars...but I simply can't give this book a higher rating when, to me, it is really incomplete."
4,A stellar read.,"Brain Fever is terrifying and exhilarating, a pleasure all the way through, which is maybe not what you'd expect from a novel about a middle-aged guy's crack-up. The language starts out jangly, ready to take off, from the beginning, and is downright jagged by the time Tim Rooney loses it, but you feel like you've been somewhere with this guy. Highly recommended."
5,Great set of songs!,I love the songs in this CD! They are very good for cheering up anybody and put you to dance
5,Exelent Top of CDs,"The CD encompases most of ""fundamento"" cereminie, The singer Lasaro Ross is one of the top Santeria singers, has a very ethinic sound, while is easy to understand the proper pronuntiations of the words. This CD makes an exelent adition to any library, but especially for those who whant to learn the proper way to worship the orisha."
4,Authentic Cuban style field recording,"Conjunto Folklorico Nacional de Cuba's MUSICA YORUBA represents Afro-Cuban folkloric music at its best.The quality is sharp and clear, but the basic drum/vocal beats are pure field recording in authentic Cuban style."
3,"I Liked This CD, But...","As manager of ""The Oktoberfest Webring,"" I am always on the lookout for CD's of good Oktoberfest music. Unfortunately, contrary to the way this CD is billed, there is very little traditional Oktoberfest music on this disc, and a number of different musical groups are represented--not just one. Even so, this CD contains a lot of entertaining, expertly performed German music, mostly in the form of Bavarian folksongs, many of which are taken from a CD entitled, ""Folksongs From Bavaria."" In a pinch, it could be used as background music at Oktoberfest celebrations, and is pleasant to listen to in its own right."
5,A Masterpiece Of J-Rock!!!,"Eyes, is one of the best J-Rock songs that I have ever heard!!! But, I don't think that anyone should buy it, because a person can easily download this song for <u>free</u>, then burn it on a cd to listen to as much as they want!!![...]When paired with its counter-song, Overlap, Eyes makes a great song to listen to in the car, on the computer, while you shower, while you cook, while you clean, etc.I recommend: Eyes, Overlap, Shuffle, Wild Drive, Rakuen, and Warriors."
3,"OK, with some errors","This book is OK, but contains a few errors. The first review is also wrong, tri-color is not common or acceptable in American Brittanys. That is a feature of a French Brittany, and the bloodlines are distinct. One thing the book fails to underscore sufficiently is how ""hyper"" a brittany is: if you have never been around a pointing dog, please take some time to do so before getting a brittany so it doesn't wind up being orphaned. They are sweet, biddable dogs, but need to run alot every day. This is particularly true of a well-bred britt, since it will come from lines that maintain field traits. Good luck."
1,I could have googled the info in this book,This book did not contain anything I could not have found on the Internet. Looked through it once and it's now a dust collector.
3,Good but basic,A very written and illustrated book.Missing much of the true French Brittany and directed more towards the American Brittany.A good basic book on the breed.
5,Excellent survey of artists and forms,"This is a nice way to settle back in with poetry if you have been away from it for a while. Hunter gives us a collection of outstanding writings from the western tradition. There is enough about form and structure to add to our appreciation of the artists' work without distracting from the meaning and emotion.There are a few chapters at the end that are very ""textbookish"" but they are brief and do not invade too much on the worth of the volume as a collection for people who do not plan to write ""about poetry""."
5,Excellent Product,"Perfect for 2 handguns, plus ammo, tools, ear/eye protection, etc. Very sturdy and well made for the cost, which was a real bargain. Shopped same item elsewhere, much higher cost. Shipping was good. I have a similar case in canvas for range use also, but for competetion, this offers so much more security and class! The re-arrange of the foam is a plus also, gives you some choices. I can't brag enough, as for the smell, 3 days in the garage opened up and smell was gone. Great item for me. Thanks."
4,awesome,"I got this for my glock 19 and all the accessories.It hold one glock 19, two ear muffs, two eye goggles, two magazines (or more), my glock light/laser attacked to gun, lula quick ammo loader, my blackhawk holster, and over 300 ammo in small 100box containers with room to spare. I also like the fact that it locks. It is sturdy and well built. For some it maybe too big to carry around. For me it fits what I need it for. I like things organized rather than throwing everything in a bag or so.I rate it 4 stars due to the lock could be stronger.Love this box. At home I keep my glock in a more secured case. All I have to do is get my glock put it into the box and grab my targets and we are ready to go to the shooting range at an instant."
5,Range Case,"very good design and construction. The foam provides more than adequate protection as does the aluminum case. If you gun is longer than the approximate 9 inches that it says is the max you can cut the foam to accept a total length of around 10.5 to 11 inches as I did for my Ruger GP100 with a 9"" barrel. Plenty of storage compartments that can be rearranged in a variety of shapes to accommodate 95% of your items."
3,"Second worst NES Mega Man, but still good","Proto Man has turned evil and kidnapped Dr. Light? He assembled an army of robots and unleashed them on the world? Come on! I'm sure a first grader could figure out Wily is behind this. And the innovations here? The Rush Jet is still in the ""piece of junk"" mode from Mega Man 4, and the Super Arrow is next to useless. The music is not good in most places. Proto Man's fortress is a NIGHTMARE! I'm a master game player and even I have trouble with it. There is no Energy Tank in the final fortress station, so if you don't have any to use on Wily you're gonna lose and probably have to start over. Most NES Mega Man games are great, but this is just mediocre."
2,"""You are the weakest Link!""",Mega Man V is definitely the weakest of all 8 original Mega Man games. It's so easy that you can beat it with the Mega Buster all the way through. You don't need any of the weapons because each of the bosses dies very quickly as good ole blue Mega Man. I beat the game within a couple of days [...].
2,What Happened ???,"I first played this game on my emulator 4 years ago. I found this game to be extremeley boring. There is nothing new with this game and its just not on the same level as the 4 before it. I recommend u to stick with the first 4 Mega Man games and avoid this one if u are new to Mega Man. I never got into any Mega Man games after 4, not even Mega Man X series. Maybe its cause I am older now but I seriously think if this was a good game I would have liked it when I first tried it."
2,If you liked the other Gambler movies . . .,". . . you probably would like this one! I didn't care for it that much and was disappointed about the ""big stars"" that were supposed to be in it. Mostly, they just played short cameos . . . the fight scene was pretty hilarious, and there were some occasional laughs, but not something I'd watch again if I had a choice."
4,Old western heroes unite!,"Join Kenny Rogers as he meets up with Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) and a host of old time western TV stars such as Chuck Connors, Claude Akins, Gene Barry, Johnny Craford and Hugh O'Brian in this made for TV flick. It's a very pleasant way to spend a few hours!"
2,kenny,I am not a Kenny Rogers fan but my husband is so I bought this one. He is a very good singer but not a good actor in my opinion. I gave him 2 stars for my husband.
5,My Western Hero's Are Back!,"Was never really into the Gambler movies, BUT this one is totally exceptional! Reba in her black Western outfit and seeing her shoot the bad guys was great! Seeing Bat, Lucas and Mark, Wyatt, Cheyenne, the Virginian and the others was nothing less than SUPURB!! If you watched and loved these Western tv shows as much as I did/do, you'll love this DVD movie!"
2,The Gambler Returns: Luck of the Draw,"I was excited when I ordered The Gambler Returns: Luck of the Draw for a Christmas present for my husband. When I ordered this DVD it was listed as ""NEW"" which I thought was really great. We didn't open and view the DVD until three weeks ago, only to discover the DVD wasn't the actual movie, it was recorded from a television showing. There were blank commercial throughout the DVD and half way through the movie stopped and displayed ""TO BE CONTINUED"". A few minutes later it came back on with a brief overview of what we had already seen. There were more blank commercial spots all the way to the end of the movie. I was greatly disappointed that I had paid so much for this movie expecting it to be an uninterrupted actual MOVIE not a DVR version. I feel like this company misrepresented the description of this DVD, therefore, I would like to have what I ordered, the actual movie version or else a refund."
2,Not Good for Beginners!,"This is a very frustrating dvd to try if you're new to dancing. In my opinion, this dvd falls way short on actual teaching and structure. I had a real tough time following along. The instructors shown don't actually teach the dances, they just dance the pieces while a British narrator talks throughout. I felt the dancers looked good when showing the dances, but the instruction given was way too fast, incomplete, and not well thought out for beginners. I was left with many more questions than answers. Sorry, but I would not recommend it to someone who wants to learn to dance."
1,"Yes, it does make a difference","I had been using UV filters mainly for lens protection, but I always knew that they reduced the quality of the image. I would remove the filter when I wanted the best results. Then someone talked me into getting a high quality clear filter. This Hoya seemed like a good choice. When I got it, I did a test with my camera on a tripod. I took several pairs of comparison shots. Without fail, the shots with the Hoya were darker, and areas that were bright had that brightness dulled considerably. I posted the images for photographer friends to see, and they came to the same conclusion: a definite loss of quality.Since the only purpose of this pricey filter was to protect the lens, there is no reason for me to keep it and lose image quality as I did with the cheap filters."
5,Great Great Great,I bought this for my Tokina 11-16 DX lens. It is one of the few out there that will not interfere with the field of vision on this lens because it is very shallow from top to bottom. It works perfectly only because I can't tell a difference in my pictures. Get this and protect your camera. It is a bit pricey but why wouldn't you spend money on a good filter if you are protecting an even more expensive lens?
4,"Great filter, but not ""always on"" as some reviews would have you think.","First off, this is a great filter. It's by far one of the best filters I've ever purchased, next to my Hoya Polarizer. I have it mounted on the canon 24-105L. Clarity is great, when at wide angle it doesn't add any vignetting like other filters I've owned. And even after getting very salty (due to ocean spray) it wipes off clean without a scratch.However, one of the reasons you buy a multi-coated filter is to prevent the glare caused by a DSLR's sensor reflecting light. This is where this filter failed me. I found it only marginally better than many lower priced filters at preventing reflections or glare when taking low lit shots."
5,Engaging. Steeped in real life. A mystery to savor.,"Marlis Day spins a tale composed of real people and possibilities. You'll feel you know them and are interacting throughout. In particular, teachers and school administrators will see themselves, their students and their predicaments come to life on the page."
4,She called it like she saw it,"Alice Thomas Ellis was a tough British lady who took a long and cold eyed look at the state of the church in the years after Vatican II and she didn't like what she saw. She was horrified by the changes: priests who seemed more like athiests, nuns who were more concerned with validating themsleves that in serving Jesus, Masses that seemed more like a backwoods tent meetings and so on. She was not gentle in expressing her disgust and it's impossible to read the book without being shaken. Some people may find Ellis's tone too harsh but I saw her remarkable humor and wit amidst the fire and anger.It's a very good book by a clever writer. Its passionate but not gooey. If you can find this book--- I gaurantee you that it won't be in your local Catholic bookstore, don't hesitate to buy it."
3,intersting info,although a lot of this makes sense I din't see any statements as to how humans may have evoled genetically. My ancesters have been eating beef for nearly 150 years
2,Poor quality control - Save your money,"This is a disappointing, poorly printed book. As an earlier reviewer noted, the tables are small, fuzzy, and very difficult to read. They appear to have been copied from another source and pasted into the middle of the text with no regard for the new format. I'm surprised that Dr. D'Adamo wants his name associated with such an inferior product. His other books are much better quality. Plus, there isn't much in this book worth the purchase. I'm sorry that I bought it."
1,Is a little consistency too much to ask?,"While I find the concept of eating for your blood type intriguing, I was really disappointed in the quality of this guide book. The book is supposed to be specifically for those who, like me, have Type B blood. I found repeated instances where the tables would list a food as being one to avoid, then the text of the same segment would tell us to try is as an alternative. Can I have Barley or not? Is amaranth a good substitute for wheat or not? Specific questions posed to the website resulted in a generic email response telling me to check out the website. No answers were ever found. Pity they couldn't take a little more care about the people they supposedly are trying to help."
4,Everything you ever wanted to know about your blood type,"Not only did I learn where in world history my blood type ""originated"", but I also know now why a low-carb diet has been the best thing to ever happen to me. The low-carb lifestyle concentrates on eliminating certain foods from my diet, and those foods just so happen to be bad for me as a type O anyway! It's great! In the same vein, the reason low-carb did not work for my type-A husband is because the food we thought he was supposed to be eating was the same food that can be ""poison"" for his particular blood type. Problem solved! This book was very helpful to us both."
3,Information is too 'general' not specific enough for me.,This book will be very helpful for some but it isn't helpful for me. Information is too 'general' not specific enough for me. It is a very good read but was not what I am looking for.
4,"Blood Type B Food,Beverage'and Supplement",This paperback is a very good version of the book Eat for your Blood type it can be used as a quick reference.
4,Handy,"This is a handy little book to have if one is planning on ""Eathing for your Blood Type"". It's organized in a pretty easy to read/find manner."
2,BOLOGNA,Another diet book. This is one my Sister swears by. Ho hum.She's lost nearly 40 pounds so whatever works for her.
1,"They changed the formula, it is no good now","I used to LOVE this lotion. It was all I would buy. I had a stockpile of it. My stockpile ran out and I reordered. It is an ENTIRELY different formula! It has a terrible perfume smell to it. I am so mad. Now I have three bottles of this I cannot use! Warning, if you haven't bought it in a while, don't get it again, it is not the same lotion at all. I am so very disappointed."
5,BEST lotion we have ever used,I have heard that Jason is discontinuing this lotion...sure hope this is NOT true!!!! This is BY FAR the VERY BEST lotion we have used!!!! LOVE IT!!!!
2,Not good enough,"I have very dry skin which is worse now that I've switched to natural products because I have not yet found a soap or lotion to match Dove and Jergens respectively in terms of moisturizing. This lotion is nice and thick but my skin, especially back, is still very dry and feels uncomfortable. I mix it with olive oil and I still have to reapply about 3 times to my back and it still feels uncomfortably dry.Update:The tube DOES reach to the bottom of the container, but for some reason, when the lotion reaches a good distance from the bottom, the lotion does not come out - I have to take off the top and pound it out.After having this for a few weeks, it started to smell like stink wet hair, like if it has gone bad. I did not put anything directly into the bottle."
1,Huge Disappointment,The CD was a total disappointment. Most of the selections are so short (many less than 2 min) they sound like they were cut in the middle. The pieces that are extended just don't make up for the rest. George Fenton certainly is a genius (I have the BBC TV Series so I have heard how great he is) but this CD was a total waste of money and a ripoff.
3,"Nice music, but where's the opening theme?","I like the music, and I liked the program. Especially I liked the opening theme for the program, but that is not on this CD. Wouldn't you think that the program's main theme would make it to a CD of the soundtrack of the program?"
5,"Had it for a couple of years now, and have gifted a few more...","I've enjoyed this for 2-3 years now. Looks sharp, sounds great, gets me to the church on time... it *is* a large for a travel clock, but a great size for a travel sound system! Friends who commented on it have ended up with one for xmas, they love it too."
2,Don't waste your money,"Although the product does have some cool features, the product does not live up to the hype. Sharper Image products are pricey anyway, but the big deal is supposed to be the ""aluminum cone"" speakers; well that's what they sound like, aluminum. I should have tested the product at the store first. You can add better speakers using the 1/8"" stereo jack, but that's an additional expense. If this thing cost $99 instead of $199, it would be worth it. I was disappointed, and I only paid $120 because I bought it reconditioned. There are better products out there, albeit without all the ""sound soother"" extras, but if you care about the sound quality, you'll probably do better elsewhere."
2,Works Great the Second Time Around,"The first time I bought this the CD player didn't work. But after getting the replacement, I'm now very happy with it."
2,Grow a real beard!,"Starring Gene Barry (Abraham, with a really bad wig and beard), Ed Ames (Daniel Boone) and Ross Martin (Wild, Wild West).This episode starts with the accidental killing of an enemies son by Abraham, is this in the Bible? Hmm? And continues on with the plot of Hagar and her uncle (Martin) first trying rescue Ishmael, a very passive (toward Isaac) but precocious Ishmael (weird) and then attempting to supersede Abrahams desire that Isaac be the inheritor over his older brother. The episode ends with the sacrifice scenes. Again I ask you. Is this the Bible? Barry gives a good perfomance but he should've grown the beard himself."
1,Not the Abraham I know!,"Aside from the pitiful acting, this account of the life of Abraham & Isaac is 90% fiction. More attention is given to a feud between Abraham & a neighboring warlord (which is not found in scripture) & a plot by Hagar's uncle to have Isaac killed so that Ishmael can inherit Abraham's fortune (also not in scripture) than to the actual account of Abraham's struggle over God's command to sacrifice his son. That scene -- supposedly the thust of the movie) -- lasts less than three minutes & involves no struggle or suspense whatsoever, Don't waste your money!"
3,Not her best,"Personally, I'm not crazy about romance novels that have the hero and heroine and each other's throats, and this one does. Jessica was raised by her stubborn, angry father, who taught her to hate the mother who deserted her. Chase Summers is the stepson of Rachel (Jessica's mother), who gets caught up in the feud between Jessica and Rachel. Jessica is angry, sullen, and hard to like. Chase, too, is angry, stubborn, and not as appealing as some of Johanna Lindsey's other heroes. Together, they pretty much make each other miserable. Not one my favorites."
2,"Fair, but not very good.","The best part about this book is the prologue, which is quite exciting. After that the book loses the momentum."
2,did'nt like this one at all,"JL is one of the best romance writers and i have enjoyed many of her books but this was not one of them. the heroine was just horrible, she was a total brat. and there was'nt much romance between her and the hero, no real feelings. and he seemed to be a little afraid of her."
2,Boring!!,i can't find any other word for it. The heroine is a brat. I didn't enjoyed this at all. The spin off this book is way much better.
4,An intese romance that will have you seeking for more.,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. I have all of Johanna Lindsey's collection. This book was one of her first published and one of the very lasts I read. Brave the Wild Wind is an exciting book that takes you into rage, love, anxiety, and more than anything passion! I recommend this book to anyone that loves historical romances."
5,Excellent series.,Love all of the Wyoming series. So much fun to read with feisty heroines and strong heroes. Would definitely recommend
4,Nice light read,"I am a succor for Lindsey, I loved this one all three books in this series set in the American west was good I wold give it 5 stars but i prefer ANGEL. Buy this book its good."
5,Brave the wild wind,Great story could not put it down even when my eyes were extremely tired. I enjoy all of her books
3,Brave the Wild Wind,"This could of been a better story if they had not made Jessie so selfish and childish. I just didn't care for her and that caused me not to like the book as much as I could of. Chase as Ok, but how these two ever ended up together I have no idea. Another one of those I debated what to give it. Ended up giving it a 3 instead of a 2. It wasn't that bad but it wasn't great. The rest of the series Savage Thunder and Angel are great."
3,A lindsey book can never disappoint,"I absolutely adore Johanna Lindsey, but must admit this almost beat captive bride to the ""worse johanna lindsey"" - however it is one of her first and every fan should read it even if just to appreciate the rest even more. what I want to know is where is the next malory? I have been waiting for Jeremy's story since we were introduced to him - what about his bet with Amy?"
5,Good for nurses or for any interested layperson,"This book gives you a good introduction to pathophysiology without being very technical. Even if you are not a medical professional, you will still grasp the concepts because the author gives simple but adequate definition of the disease and its underlying causes. I am a career switcher (switched to RN) and this book worked for me."
3,good book,"This patho book is VERY detailed, but has a wealth of info. In some cases I found it to be too detailed, lacking in others. Overall, a good reference book, easy to understand."
1,Maybe it was me,Maybe it was just me but I found this book very hard to follow. In the end I did not use this book at all b/c I could not follow it
1,WASTE OF MONEY,MY PROF. (A CARDIAC SURGEON)HATED THE FORMAT OF THE BOOK...WE RARELY USED IT BECAUSE OF THE FORMAT AND THE WAY THE INFORMATION WAS PRESENTED..
1,Essentials of Pathophysiology,"I cannot review this item since I received an empty package in the mail. Yes, that's right, I paid for the book and never received it! Tries to contact the seller twice with no response. Sorry, cant help you."
4,The Shaggy D.A. Should Be On DVD!,I have good memories of watching The Shaggy D.A. with my friends and I think this is a very cute Disney movie and I want to see it put on DVD and I would like it to be in widescreen and not an edited pan and scan DVD!
2,A somewhat sorry attempt at black metal,"Look Im a Christian and as a Christian I know we cant make Black Metal. We lack the sheer darkness to do it. Like Cradle Of Filth has this errie feel to it like youre walking trough a crypt in the caverns of hell. They sound kinda like Dimmu Bogir but they dont have the lets darkness. I like Underoath and Zao they do progressive metal and they do it well, but black metal has to be demonic and evil. So if youre Christian and won't listen to Cradle then may I suggest a christan band called Zao or an Viking band called Amon Amarth or a Athest band called Lunaris. Yeah they just don't have what it takes to be Black."
4,Great Reading: Susan Sontag meets Martha Stewart!,"O'Neill is an excellent writer and has stretched the boundaries of cookbook writing in an interesting way. Although her characters are not always interesting, the philosophy of the dinner party they evolve is. The recipes aren't really the heart of the book, but they, too, are interesting."
2,O'Neill fails to soothe my mind,"Although the premise behind ""The Pleasure of Your Company"" (gossipy tales of dinner party qualms interspersed with well thought-out party menus) is a great one, the trials and tribulations of O'Neill's hoity-toity cast of characters seem unlikely to hit home with American dinner party hostesses outside Manhattan.This silly trifle of a book is mildly diverting, but a sturdy classic cookbook is a much better buy."
5,Great Tire,I LOVE these tires so far. I have a couple hundred miles on them and they grip the road and have great rolling capacity. I'll be buying more for sure.
2,Great for performance but don't last long,"These tires are awesome for racing but for just everyday riding both tires lack sidewall protection. Got two side blowouts when I didn't hit any debrie. Would not recommend this for normal riding. Great feel, grip is great, but does not last long."
3,bad luck,good looking tire but only lasted me 600 miles...hit some road debris and the sidewall blew out
2,Not what I was hoping.,"Was initially excited when I read many positive reviews about these tires. I purchased these tires in preparation for my annual 400 mile trip through Michigan. Ended the trip with 2 flats and several chewed up spots on both tires. Since I am only a bicycle enthusiast, who puts on maybe 800 miles/year, maybe I misunderstood the description of these tires and gave them more credit then they deserved. All I know, they did not hold up anywhere near what I expected under mostly good road conditions. Booo to yellow Continental Grand Prix 4000's. They get 2 stars only because I still like the way they look on my blue and yellow Masi!"
4,great quality,"Wow, I never heard something or seen this movie before. I was wondering when I found this WArner Archive Collection here on Amazon. I was not really sure if would be it (the movie) in good quality (in sound and picture) - and yes, it is in very good condition (very sharp and clean!)But I was surprised. OK, on this release are no Chapters, subtitles or bonus features - but the movie was a thrilling and romantic movie in black & white with Troy Donahue."
1,Your Joking Right ?,Not an easy game to play. Takes forever to beat the first 4 levels to get each key.When you get to the next level after that your screwed.You play kermit and guess what is his weapon of choice ? a feather.Only part you get stuck at is the purple monster push you off and game over.Would not recommend this game for anyone.
1,Closed Minded Ideology at work to make you less intelligent,"Well, if you're a closed minded, self righteous, flaming extremist right-wing type of person... you're perfect for this book. Not only will you be filled with poor information, but you will read how ""not to be tolerant"", and there is alot of ""hate"".......and the reader will come to understand why the right is so uninformed.Being a Catholic, and a strong Democrat, I could only chuckle at the shallow thought process a reader must have to enjoy this ""waste of time and space"". If your ""faith"" has you blinded, and willing to follow empty words religiously, you'll enjoy it. But the intelligent part of society would probably rather make a sandwich."
2,The title is a lie.,"Democrats hate abortion just as much as anyone else. They just don't think that a woman should be treated as a murderess because she had one. If abortion is murder than any woman who ever had one should be executed. And every boyfriend who paid for one is an accessory to murder. That's the logical outcome of Ponnuru's argument. Democrats want as few abortions as possible, but they don't want to create a new class of criminal. And Terry Schaivo wasn't killed. She was being kept ""alive"" artificially and died of natural causes. Most people would thank her husband for pulling the plug on the grotesque prison of a body that held back her soul. Sometimes death isn't all that bad."
1,A little over the Top,"Ok, so we all know that there are special interest groups that lobby and contribute financially to every political candidate. However, it's not the conspiracy it's made out to be in this book.Also, the author failed to discuss the feelings and personal trials of mothers who have to make the horrible choice of abortion.I don't think abortion is right. However, I believe that every woman should have the right to choose, and ignoring women's opinions on the matter, automatically invalidates the argument."
1,Doh!,"Good Lord (Dark or otherwise) this book proves that you can get just about anything published as long as it's off key enough or falls into a ""conservative"" sphere of opinion. As ""Eddie Izzard"" says ""With re-cycling just about anything is possible"". I suggest that that is the ideal fate for this load of old cobblers."
1,Based On a Lie,"This ""gentleman"" was on the Stephen Colbert Report last night claiming that the ""Supreme Court gave women the right to unlimited abortions at any time during their pregnancy"".Anyone who has actually bothered to read Roe Vs. Wade (unlike Ponnuru) knows that ruling only allows voluntary abortion during the first trimester. After that it is regulated by the state and most states have laws limiting voluntary abortions to the first trimester only. It's full text as well as state abortion laws are on the internet, look it up.The argument over abortion is a legitimate one, but these sorts of tactics make the Right to Life Movement look like idiots led by a pack of not only liars, stupid liars..."
1,Hogwash,"balderdash, baloney, bilge, bunk, drivel, piffle, poppycock, rot, rubbish, trash and twaddle. But other than that it's just a great and wonderful door stop."
1,Dismal propaganda,It's almost insane that years after Reagan began the bankruptcy of our country this nonsense can still find a publisher.
1,"THE WRITER OF TRASH: The disregard for decorum, morality and decency","Mr. Ponuru is a shameless shill. He offers no solutions, no common ground, just over heated rhetoric. Who will adopt 45 million babies? How would the social infrastructure support all the unwanted children in the world? Why does a man have the right to tell a woman what to do with her own body!Trash. Don't waste your money."
1,Is there a rating lower than one star?,"The title itself shows a clear bias against rational debate of the subject, and the claim that the ""pro-life"" stance is unrelated to or even significantly separate from religious beliefs is flawed at best, insane at worst. The author is a fear-mongering ignoramus, with little understanding of logic."
1,Horror show,"Disconnected and fatally flawed logic -- to the degree that there's logic here at all and not just blind aherence to party dogma -- characterizes this pile of garbage masquerading as political commentary. Ponneru is a rank amateur. He's also dead wrong.Oh, and Stewart eviscerated him on The Daily Show. Way to prepare, Ramesh!"
1,I saw this guy on Daily Show last night,"He had absolutely no idea what he was talking about. When Jon Stewart asked him about the war, he replied, ""I was against the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki."" What? That saved thousands of lives!That interview alone proves that this book is not worth my time. If you don't like abortion, support increased education to lower it."
1,Bush-Cheney-Rove,"Hum, the GOP and and the killing of innocents in the middle east is the party of death. The GOP and its destruction of the wilderness and wildlife is the party of death. The GOP and its tax breaks for the obscenely rich is the party of death. The GOP and it disregard for the constiution is the party of death. The GOP and its push for faith-based policy instead of science or fact-based policy is the party of death. The GOP and its hatred of women's sexuality is the party of death..."
3,Let's go visit some old friends....,"most of the Avengers crowd is here - Dr. Keel, Cathy Gale, Emma Peel and Tara King join forces with Steed to save Mother and Rhonda from Cybernauts. Only Venus Smith (from the very early series) and the New Avengers (Purdy and Gambit) are missing. Everyone gets their 'star turn' in this typical adventure.The plot revolves around the cybernauts' return this time with voice synthesizer technology to implicate Steed and Mother in treason. The some of the most popular of Steed's partners are called in to help solve this mystery. If you are an Avengers fan you'll enjoy this one for the little updates on the former partn ers. If you are not a fan of the series don't start here because you'd never have a clue about what is going on. The main plot is a bit weak, the ending in particular is a bit anticlimatic.All in all this is about on a par with the better fanfic that is available on the internet for free."
2,Like a candle compared to the sun,"Inspite of being a fan of Dave Liebman for many years I didn't much appreciate this project, especially when you listen to the ""original"". Liebman alone can't stand up to Coltrane + Pharaoh Sanders. The arrangements are no improvement. The sound is less sharp and the band is somewhat out of focus. The music is dissolving. A re-recording only makes sense when new aspects come to light. This sadly is not happening here."
5,Does the job,Much cheaper from Amazon than what my cell phone company tried to squeeze out of me for a 3 year old phone charger. Very happy.
1,False Advertusing?,The listing I see here is FIVE pens each a different color. Granted the written description says a green pen BUT it is very easy when in a hurry to think this is a listing for FIVE pens and order. I own all these pens and was tempted for a minute or so until it occured to me too many for too little. Ususally what is in the picture is what is for sale. These are good pen. I own all of them and was tempted to buy more if this was all shown. My stars are for the listing not the pens.
1,funny but poor quality,My husband loves bears and we saw an antique one of these at a friend's house which he totally coveted. How plastic could a resin version be? I thought and went ahead with this version when eBay didn't offer any metal ones. SUPER plastic-y is the answer! I think it would tip over if we actually put a bottle in it and it looks really cheap.
4,Too cute!,"This was intended as a gift for my mother's birthday. She loves cabin decor, and she loves wine. So it was perfect for her. She absolutely loves it!My only complaint, and why it's not 5 stars, was the packaging and defects. The wrap for the package was all off to one side, so there was lots of room for damage, and the styrofoam inside the box the bear comes in, half of it was molded perfectly, half was taped together like the other half had been lost. Overall, packaging was horrible, and allowed for some defects. On one of his ears, the paint had chipped. Lucky the color is a perfect match to sharpie. I didn't order with enough time to return, so this worked enough.Please package better! I'd love to buy from the company again, if not for the packaging."
5,A good gift,"I also purchased this as a gift. It is really funny, and matches log-cabin style decor pretty well. I think it is made of a hard resin plastic, which is pretty durable and solid.Seems like it will fit a wide range of bottle shapes and sizes."
5,A must have in your bellydance music collection,"Dont let the gaudy album cover scare you away! The name George Abdo is synonymous with great bellydance music and your music collection is not complete without him. Seriously.Whether you are tribal or oriental or somewhere in between you will love this vintage ""harem girl"" style bellydance CD. The music is exotic and intoxicating, the finger cymbals astounding. George Abdo never disappoints with his warm vocals and amazing Flames of Araby Orchestra!! A total classic."
1,Bellydance! The Best of George Abdo and his Flames of Araby Orchestra,The music wasn't useful for bellydance. I didn't like this music at all and was disappointed.
3,A bit boring....,"I ordered this without knowing what it was all about. I thought it would be a movie with some good plot. It turned out to be a very boring & lousy plot movie. The title is a bit misleading... So, save your money on this movie deal."
3,Good enough for cheap price,"My daughter became addicted to the apples and bananas song after seeing it on you tube. so we had to get this DVD. I'm not a huge fan, but my daughter really likes it. Its good for the price."
1,Not So Favorite Sing-a-Longs,"This DVD is terrible! Don't confuse it with Favorite Nursery Rhymes, which my 11 month old granddaughter loves (and has loved since 6 months). The animation is cheap looking and cheesy and most of the songs are annoying and uninteresting. Most of us could write better lyrics! If my granddaughter enjoyed it I would continue to suffer through it, but she watched this video with a scowl on her face."
1,DVD came broken,"I ordered both DVDs Baby Genius: Favorite Sing-A-Longs & Sing-Along Songs - The Bare Necessities, i got shoked when i opened the Baby Genius DVD pack and found that the DVD was broken in half, my daughter was waiting for this DVD for almost 2 weeks, i got so disappointed, wont recommend it to any of my friends. be careful"
2,Disappointing,This DVD was disappointing. The original songs were not that well written. The familiar songs were not the most familiar versions. I would not recommend this DVD.
3,"No words to be a real ""sing-a-long"" DVD","Before I opened this Christmas present, I looked on here to read the reviews. I should have read more than just the first few. This DVD really is poor. There are not any words where they can read to sing a long to the DVD. I rather them just listen to their CDs for music than stare mindlessly at the television. I am so disappointed in this DVD. The graphics are not even that great. Don't bother purchasing this. Do a search on other sing-a-long DVDs and spend your money more wisely.My twins are 2 and they are fascinated by it after just one viewing. However, they love music CDs just as much and at least they play with their toys while listening to the CD than just mesmerized by the television."
2,Disappointed,"bought this one without hesitation because my sons love the Nursery Rhymes and Favorite Children Songs so much. songs are repetitive and the DVDs/CDs are short, carrying less songs than the previous ones."
5,Please read the LA Times article on Chinese adoption,I read a revealing article in Sept 2009 on Chinese adoption and the agencies that have failed to detect a major child traffiking ring. It's a sad story that has to be shared.
3,The White Swan Express,"I orderd this book for my adopted from China daughter since we spent time at the White Swan Hotel when we adopted her. It is a precious book, beautifully illustrated and well written. However, I am returning it. The book portrays an adoption by a lesbian couple, not only outside my comfort zone in a book for a 4 year old, but also prohibited by the Chinese government. One review that I read prior to purchase indicated that it was not clear the the couple was gay, but my take on it is different. I thought other parents might like to know ahead of time. I am disappointed!"
3,The White Swan Express,I was really excited to find a book that told the story of my children because they are both from the Guangzhou area. I looked through this book briefly in the book store and bought two copies one for us and one for my daughter's christian preschool. Well needless to say I returned the one for my daughters school. I like the story but it was a great over site to have an openly lesbian couple heading to China and actually displaying affection in front of the coordinator and aunties. China's adoption rules do not allow for same sex partners to adopt. I know that this happens but it would not be so in your face. This makes the story less true to life. Don't get me wrong I would rather see a child go to a competent same sex couple than stay in an orphanage but this is totally against China's rules and should not been included so openly in this story.
1,A children's book with a political agenda,"As other reviewers have indicated, this children's book portrays a lesbian couple as one of several families adopting a baby from China. Whether or not you believe that this is detrimental to the children involved (and I acknowledge that there are good arguments on both sides), this is ABSOLUTELY prohibited by the Chinese government. Therefore, I see this book as insulting to the country that has permitted thousands of people to adopt its wonderful children. I also do not see this as appropriate material for children. I returned this book in short order."
3,Fair,"Lovely book about adoption, but very inaccurate. Homosexual couples cannot adopt in China or in any foreign country. They can only adopt domestically in the United States. There is so much misinformation about adoption already - please do some research and get your facts straight if you are going to write a book about it! Please!"
4,Parenthood with a Broad and Beautiful Paintbrush,"Even though this is a book that crosses the line for some parents. The reality is that there are all kinds of ways to make a family. To judge the authors for focusing on a non-traditional family ignores the beauty of this experience. Even if China does forbid one from declaring oneself of an alternative sexual orientation, the reality is that these loving couples provide wonderful homes for children. Children understand love. They need to know that love comes in many different forms. My husband (yes I am hetero) and I loved this book for painting such a beautiful picture."
4,Another good story to facilitate discussion....,"This book is an unusually illustrated story about four diverse families finding their way to China and their Chinese daughters. Of course, I did cry when I read it to my four year old Lucy (d.o.a. 10/98, Jiangsu Province), but Lucy already knows from our many previous readings on the subject that I am crying because I am happy! My daughter and I have discussed most adoption issues very candidly and she has done a fabulous job processing her ""history"". I did object to the book's rather frequent use the word ""orphanage"", which I assiduously avoid at home because of its very negative connotation in this country. The book also makes reference to some silver bracelets with bells which none of my friends or I had ever heard of, or bought, while in China. All in all, though, another good story to help the past seem real to the girls, and to help them find their own stories."
3,"Too dense, too many people","Four happy couples are getting ready to fly to China to pick up their little girls. The book is very crowded with names and places which may overwhelm a young child. The simplicity and enchantment of Rose Lewis' I love you like Crazy Cakes stands in stark contrast.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"
1,not too swift,"Althought the love they feel for the child they adopt in this really really dense children's story is evident in every syllable, as a mother of a Chinese daughter and hopefully mother of more Chinese daughters, I am really disappointed that the authors would chose to openly disclose to China their homosexual relationship. China demands you sign a SWORN statement of ""non=homosexuality"". While unthinkable to most Americans, this is a demand of a rigid government with no sense of humor whatsoever. To OPENLY flout a casual attitude for a sworn statement could jeopardize future adoptions for many children. The Chinese do not like to be disparaged or be made fools of. Think about the broader consequences of telling your tale in print."
1,Very regretful we ordered this one... we returned it.,"The White Swan Hotel and all the lore surrounding it are cherished memories in our China adoption family. The title of this book obviously drew us to purchase it. However, we were very upset and offended that the authors chose to use a children's book as a vehicle for advancing lesbian lifestyle acceptance in the name of multiculturalism. This is an in-your-face affront to the gracious and trusting Chinese officials who have specifically requested that the Chinese children not be adopted by anyone who is gay or lesbian."
1,Disappointed,"We were shocked to find that one of the four couples adopting the Chinese babies was a female same-sex couple. Regardless of your beliefs, this was an inaccurate depiction as China does not allow same-sex couples to adopt their children. Also, it is a CHILDREN'S book and I don't think we will we be ready for a discussion on same sex marriage with our little girl."
1,Only wish I could leave NO stars...,"Wow... first they lie to a government that is doing us the FAVOR of letting us adopt their children and then they write a book about it and change a lot of details that are really important.It is sad that ANYONE would stoop as low as to lie to a government about their sexual status when they know it is states clearly that homosexuals can NOT adopt from China. I have nothing against homosexuals at all... but liars are another issue all together!Plus... in China, people don't go around holding hands and if any goverment official had seen them doing that and found out they were lesbians, the whole adoption could have been jeopardized. The authors should be grateful that China never realized they were lying to them. Sick... and sad."
4,Not so bad,"Before I bought this book, I read some of the other reviews,what made me purchase it was, the mixed reviews. Some people were offended because it was pertaining to gay couples. I did not get that from the story. For those that thought this, howare you going to teach your daughters that they are accepted andits ok that they look different and you want people to accept them but its not ok to be gay. Double standard, in my book. Myhusband and I would not encourage our daughter to be gay but wewill teach her that the world is full of differences and that isok."
3,White Swan Express,I would never have purchased this book if I had known it features a LESBIAN COUPLE!!!!
3,Government Conspiracy With a Twist,"Question: Under what circumstances would paranoid white supremacists actually support vastly accelerated government intrusion into the lives of private citizens? This story attempts to define such circumstances in a sort of pre-apocalyptic America of the near future. But this premise is ultimately flawed since the is no natural support for the type of actions contemplated, not by conservatives, not liberals certainly not people of color or anti-government reactionaries.Nevertheless the author manages to discuss significant racial issues, and particularly inter-racial relationships, in a powerful manner. Well worth reading in spite of the unlikely premise."
5,Awesome disc,"Really dug the program with Oscar. I am mesmerized, as most people are, by his incredible pianistic skills. I never saw him in person but hearing him talk about some of his techniques, etc. is really neat. I am grateful to Marion for all these interviews with the greats."
5,A must for professional service firms,"The authors have done a superior job in offering step-by-step guidance in business development processes for professional service firms. It's tough (if not impossible)to sell and deliver work concurrently: Henry and Denise take the reader through all of the steps, and offer a great ""ladder"" to new business. No need to reinvent the strategy and tactical steps from scratch with this fine work (best I've ever seen in my 30 years of business)"
5,can't go wrong with fox farm...,Good organic nutrient. Can't go wrong with fox farm products. I use it along with Grow Big and Tiger Bloom for my nutrient lineup.
1,Big Disappointment,"This book claims ""the truth about the Mollies have never been told until now""! But if you are expecting to learn anything new, you will be disappointed. This book is really just a re-hash of old anti-capitalist, anti-Pinkerton conspiracy theories re-packaged into an imaginary first-person account, told by a Irish lawyer who supposedly lived through the times. Maybe the author thought that this would make his conspiracy theories sound more official and believable, but it doesn't. There is nothing new here. Save your money."
4,A Good Read and an Insightful Look at Troubled Times,"This book was very enlightening. And entirely plausible. I recently also readTweed's New York-Another Lookby Leo Hershkowitz. What was done to Tweed in the courts is very similar to what was done to these men. Those were the times. We hope our courts are a lot safer today, and that people aren't tried in the press like they were back then. Maybe there is still some of that. We try a lot harder to avoid it, anyway. But it was done shamelessly back then, and this book tells that story as it happened to these miners."
2,Historical Fiction,"This book on the Molly Maguires is not historical. Yes, the author did some research, but then he just makes things up so that everything will appear to fit his conspiracy theory. The author claims the Mollies were framed and blames everything on the police and the prosecutors, like O.J. Simpson. Hopefully readers will not be misled into thinking this is what actually happened.There were a lot of people killed. beaten and robbed by the Molly Maguires. Of course there were sociological factors that made their lives difficult, but this is true about most immigrants. Most of them didn't form secret gangs to intimidate and kill people.Maybe the author will write another book showing how the police, judges and lawyers framed the Mafia."
3,"Strange, but amusing","I checked this book out of the public library to read to my 5 yr. old. The story is a bit odd for children, as it deals with devil's imps, and a grouchy dad. But, my daughter loved the story and wanted it to be read over and over. I see that other reviewers had strong opinions about the content of the story, but there are several attributes to be discussed: exageration (when the dad says he hopes he'll drown), curiousness, cleverness, and just the imaginatatory way the imps steal the parents (ask the children you are reading to, ""could this really happen?""). Probably best suited for kids over 5."
4,"Quirky, clever, fun fantasy story.","This story is in no way realistic. It reminded me of classic ""tall tales,"" and I took it as a fun story of self-reliance. Alpha tricks the imps in a clever way, and her family is restored. She's a hero! I really enjoyed the silly and strange details (in these moments it was almost as if the author tapped into the spirit of imaginative children who tell implausible stories and throw in bits that baffle adults), and the illustrations are as energetic as the story. I think this fits in well in our library, and should be considered a fairy tale or fantasy story. The takeaway is that Alpha tricks the ""bad guys"" and saves the day. I have no qualms about reading this to my child, and don't think it's any scarier than Little Red Riding Hood (it's actually less violent). It's not meant to be taken seriously."
2,Rent -- Do Not Buy,"I am giving this only 2 stars because it is just a costume drama.Yes, it is about the young Goethe falling in love, but take out the name ""Goethe"" and you simply have a romantic period piece.What was missing, is what was included in ""Shakespeare In Love"" -- the brilliance of a young Shakespeare. This film should have showed hints at the genius potential of young Goethe. It only shows -- at the end of the film -- that he finally had a novel published and became famous in Europe as a romantic novelist. But that is less than 10% of what he is remembered for today (e.g. he formulated the spectrum for light). The film does not tease us with any of his upcoming scientific genius.In the film he is just a 23 yr old kid who falls in love, is heart broken, and writes a novel (at the end of the film) about loss of love and ensuing sorrow. Again, take the name ""Goethe"" out of the title and insert ""Manfred"" or any other German name, and you have the same film -- without the historical draw."
5,Great Movie,I loved this movie. The romance characters melded well together and the story line was interesting as well. I don't usually watch movies a second time unless they are great. I will watch this one again.
5,"Don't listen to what others are saying!,,,","This is overall a good album! Don't listen what other people are saying about this album! They don't know good music even when they hear it! Kaoru is a beautiful, smart, talented singer who deserves alot of recognition along with her bandmates! Keep on creating great music like this Electrostatic!"
1,Hank Chinaski,"WELL. How about same old hackneyed [stuff?] Why does anyone consider this NEW or futuristic? The critx simply love it. If you love music though this will be a tremendous let down. Same dead sound you've heard all round. Aphex Twin or MEGA X BRAND I can understand but regardless of what soundtrack they were on or the hype some corps put out, the musick of the above assuredly sounds STATIC."
4,Feeling better,"I didn't know if this medication would really work. The only ""proof"" would be to have another HIDA scan to see if my stones are smaller and fewer in number. However, I can tell you that I have seen what looks like gallstones pass from my system ( I work in a dr. office). I do feel better and I have not had a gallbladder ""attack"" since taking this medication. Anything was worth trying to avoid surgery. I am still taking this medication and have paired it with a gallbladder cleanse (since I also have a low functioning gallbladder as well as stones). I am feeling great!!!!"
1,Not sure,I read on the side something like enthalt formaldehyde. When called the company to see what that was all about they said that the chemicals used to make the medicine can sometimes cause a reaction and will contain formaldehyde but they say it has never happened. I decided to not take the chance of maybe consuming formaldehyde.
1,Be careful,"In my humble opinion, this stuff cuased me an extreme amount of discomfort for the three days I took it. Been off for two days, and no pain in comparison. I only have one large stone. The idea of shrinking this thing is nice, but if it would shrink enough to get into the duct, it would probably get stuck there. Then what? An infection, extreme pain and an emergency operation. Even though I don't want to, removal of the gall bladder is my only choice. Again, if you order this stuff, buyer beware. I, for one, do not recommend it. I am sorely tempted to make a complaint to the Food and Drug Admin. in fact. My pain was well under control until I started rowachol."
4,Easy and detailed,"I just finished working through this book on the holidays, and it is very easy to follow along and I learned a lot more about Flash in the end. I'm surprised in how much was covered in the 500ish pages, and it has made me less nervous about using Flash in my company. But I'm very impressed with how easy it was made and how much the website you build has in it. I expected to have a tough time because I don't know anything, but I made my way through with no problems. I even emailed with some extra questions and got an answer the next day. I have some of the older macromedia training from the source books on different programs, and this one follows the same format which I like. If you don't mind big long tutorials, then I recommend this book. The only reason I subtract a star is because I think the chapter on ActionScript was too long to be a single chapter, and it would be better in shorter amounts for the readers."
3,Easy to follow but hard to understand,"If you are used to Adobe CLASS IN A BOOK series, you will like the way this book walks you through examples. This book has great supplement(CD) and examples but it was really hard for me to understand things. I hope author revise this book carefully and make it more understandable on next edition. I don't want to recommend this book to any beginners."
2,"Lacking, but ok","This book has some good information, but is poorly written and fails to explain much about what is going on in the tutorials. With Macromedia's commitment to quality products, I'd expect something much better to bear the name ""Training From the Source.""There are MANY typos and grammatical errors. Did anyone proofread this thing?The book is not all bad, however. I learned a lot from it, but felt like too much was left out. Simple, basic concepts were explained repeatedly, but some of the more important stuff had little to no explanation. Tutorials instruct you to do or write certain important things, without explaining why, or what is going on.Overall, I think the book is worth about half the cover price. For more in-depth explanation, check out any of the Russell Chun Flash books. His ""Flash Advanced"" goes together well with this book."
2,Bad explanation,"I find the tutorials to be all over the place. The explanations are really hard to understand. The book does not give you all what you can do with the tools. I got to page 50 and turned around and bought the Flash mx 2004 bible, now that is a book !!!"
1,I have not received the book yet!!!,"I have not received the book yet. And I get no information, when I try to find out ""Where is my stuff"". So, I am looking forward to hearing from you - and hopefully get the book soon!Your sincerely,Ian Heilmann"
1,8 months - no book received,"It seems amazon is not able to ship this book, at least not in 8 months (I ordered it in December 2005) - Shop around or cancel your trip and wait for the new edition due in 2007."
5,Graet buy!,"These shoes were a bargain! Sandro Moscoloni shoes provide superior comfort and are very stylish. Although my husband needed to get a half size larger than he normally wears, Amazon made the return process very simple, and was quick to credit our account. We couldn't be happier with the purchase."
1,crap.,didn't work at all. we tried eighty ways from sunday to get it to play but it would just do a weird little demo.
5,gift,I purchased this game as a gift. I was looking for a used copy and went through Amazon for its reliability. This came through another vendor. I am very impressed with the entire process. I got confirming emails immediately from Amazon and the vendor. The item arrived promptly and in good condition. I hear from the recipient that the game works perfectly.
3,"Some improvements, some regressions","I migrated to the HBH-PV710 headset from the HBH-PV610. The improvements are the smaller size, the lighter weight, and much more sturdy ear loop. The ear loop on my 610 kept breaking at the curved joint. Sound quality also sounds better to those I am speaking with on the phone. The regressions of the 710 from the 610 include much shorter range (about 5' before I hear crackling!) and slightly worse audio quality for the user of the headset."
4,The US's guide to franchising,"This book is obviously aimed at the US domestic market. State by state it covers laws and practices. The sales girl said that UK franchising law was based on US law, maybe she was right. It is usefull to the UK francisor/franchisee, insofar as it gives excellent advice and working examples. The majority of its 400 pages are only useful between LA and New York, however, anyone planning to enter into a franchising agreement should imho have read this, and have it on his (or her) shelves."
5,Realistic Humor,"Even tho I'm not a parent of a kid on any type of travel team, every inch of this book was relatable. A fun, and very funny venture through the life of an everyday dad as he supports his son's sporting desires. Every page offered a laugh, and leaves you desperate to see what the next page holds. Very well written."
5,This is your life...If you're a hockey mom/dad,"This book was a fantastic read. Written from the hockey dad's prospective it tells the stories of what you WILL encounter if your child chooses to play ice hockey. As i'm on year number 4 myself with my son and and year 3 with my daughter I found over and over the situations I encountered were par for the course. What made an even more personal connection was that many of the ice rinks mentioned I too have been to and thought the same things. The stories of a travel hockey family will naturally appeal to other hockey families, but any parent dealing with their kids sporting teams will enjoy the writers creative words."
3,Does The Job,"When used with the right connectors, it works pretty well. It does confirm your wires are in the correct order before making the crimp. The only problem is, it does not cut all of the excess wire off. You will need to trim them with wire cutters or nail clippers. That small task is well worth knowing you have the wires in the correct order before crimping."
2,easy though insufficient,"easy to wire the connectors for an old loosing my eyesight guy, the one I recieve DOES NOT PRESS THE PINS IN THE CONNECTOR to their home position resulting in failed connection. I have to use my cheaper, crimpers to properly seat the pins. I hope the cut off blade is adjustable, for now i have to find another tool to complete the wire cut off. Over priced connectors make thinking of lasic surgery as a better option"
2,Awful,The product that I received was damage and as a result was unable to work well. It was not able to crimp the connectors properly. Pins one and two never got crimped at all. Therefore when the cable is tested it is always testing open on pins one and two.The product was returned to Amazon.
2,problems with the crimps on it's way back,"the center crimps are damaged so it's on its way back to amazon for a refund. Usually it works fine I have purchased three from amazon so far this is the first one that doesn't work, not sure but the die must have been defective from the start. Overall I would buy again but check it out right out of the box."
4,works well,"The crimper works very well. As previous reviewers have said, the two end wires don't get completely cut, but that's easy to do manually. My only gripe is that there is a piece of plastic on both side of the tool (labeled cutter) in the way that prevents you from using the tool to cut through the cable. This is the cutter/trimmer in the center of the tool - can't figure out why it was put there in the way. Otherwise, great tool."
4,"Great, but may need care","This system works pretty much as advertised -- you feed the wires into the connectors, and you can make sure that they're in the right order before you crimp.My only issue with the crimper is that I have found that I need to apply pressure slowly, or the crimper can end up mashing the end of the connector, resulting in a bad end. I actually apply a little pressure, then back off, then apply some more, then back off again, etc., until I'm applying full pressure.Even then, the two end wires don't get cut off, but they're cut most of the way through and I can remove them easily.I haven't noticed any other reviews that mention these issues, so maybe I have a defective unit?"
1,Dont wast your time,I purchased the EZ-RJ45 Crimp Tool to use with the EZ plugs. The tool will not seat the wires leaving the last two pins raised. I have had to get another crimp tool from Home Depot to seat the wires. This is an expensive wire cutter.
3,Problem tool,"I'm with State of California IT, and we do a lot of installs. It took a while to get approval to purchase this crimper for our group. Once we got it, we found that the other reports that the tool does not cut off all the wire ends when you do the crimp action is correct. It cleanly cuts off wires # 2 thru #7, but always leaves wire #1 & #8 left hanging. Looking at the tool design, it seems the cut off blade is just not long enought to cut off the first and last wire. Design bug. We still use the tool, but wish we could get a longer cut off blade for it."
3,"Flavorful, but not the same as in restaurants","My wife bought this in the hopes of recreating one of our favorite dishes at home since making butter chicken from scratch seems to be a very involved process. While this product has a good taste, it is not a substitute for restaurant style butter chicken. Also, the preparation was not as easy as the package instructions elude to. The product is a spice/ oil mix that is to be wisked with water until it is smooth. This never turned into a smooth paste for us; it did not dissolve in the water and pressing the product against the sides of the bowl was the only way for it to eventually mix with the water. She even had to strain the water mixture to make sure there weren't clumps of spice mix in the sauce before adding the mixture to the browned chicken.We will not be buying this again mostly because it is not to our taste. But, if you like flavorful chicken with a little bit of work, this is a quick meal preparation."
3,Too weird,"Following up on the success of her other Mary Magdalene books, Starbird wrote Magdalene's Lost Legacy. This book focuses on Starbird's belief that the New Testament contains wide use of gematria - the sums of certain phrases to produce sacred numbers. Starbird believes that the gematria of the New Testament reveals the union between Jesus and Mary Magdalene, and that the gematria was the cornerstone of the earliest Christian community. I had a difficult time reading this book. I never really believed in a Bible Code, and I don't need to believe in one for the Bible and/or Christianity to make sense. As much as I admire Starbird and her work, this book had zero impact on my life."
3,Finishes out woc as per the cpu game,"this book finishes out the cpu game that warcraft 3 was. It does a good job. Plenty of info here and good ideas for magical runes and 'steam warriors' could be useful if you cared to delve that far. Otherwise, it isn't necessary."
4,"Full of new features, but it's not enough for Warcraft yet","This book is cool and it covers well almost everything he intends to (I just found the Rune Spell list to be too short, but they put in there rules to create new ones). The new spells are funny and very concordant to Warcraft. My critics are not aimed to this title in particular, but to all the titles of Warcraft, that left in blank the description of some parts of the story and some parts of the world. The majority of the lore people have comes from the previous games and the MMORPG instead of the RPG books and the novels. I like very much the Warcraft ambience and I think people at Sword & Sorcecy should give priority to the descritive books rather then the rule books."
3,Guess What We Spent The First Half Hour Doing?,"I have always loved 'Guess Who' and have played it with my children forever ...I was delighted when I saw a companion to 'Guess Who'...'Guess Where'Fun after dinner and just helps bond people- family and friends.1. I wish they charged more for the game- yes, seriously! We spent a good half hour punching out the pieces and placing them in the proper areas and getting the game together. But please charge more and make it easier to enjoy when one opens the box .....Or for customers it might be wise to set the game up way ahead of time as I would think the process of getting ready would make for a loss of interest especially with younger people."
1,Not as good as Guess who,"Not fond of this game neither are my kids. Not many questions that you could ask regarding people in 4 rooms of a house. ""Is the son in the bedroom?"" Is the mom in the kitchen?"" thats about it...over and over. We love Guess Who though....sad to write a bad review here, but game is boring for kids and myself,"
3,A great addition to Guess Who,"This game is basically the same thing as Guess who with a few variations. But I tell you what even though it is similar I'm still glad we got Guess Where, it gives kids a bit of variety and keeps them interested in games that you can play as a family ( 2 players but the games are fast enough to rotate players ). I give good marks to any game that keeps the family having fun with each other."
2,For Beginners,"This book is more of a curiosity coming from a long line of worthy Kalmbach / Fine Scale Modler publications. The book covers basic skills using plenty of color photographs, but Kalmbach's ""Modeling TANKS and MILITARY VEHICLES"" by Sheperd Paine written twenty years ago (and which is still available) is more useful and remains more informative. If the title included ""Introduction to ... "" or ""For beginners"" I wouldn't have bothered to write this review. If you want to see ""realistic"" looking armor models, you won't give the cover of this book more than glance. The cover's tank looks like a plastic model in basecoat primer with some chalk dust sprinkled on it, which frankly isn't very inspiring. I would recommend this book to beginning modelers; but for those who have built a few kits, this book will soon gather dust of its own."
1,I was really desappointed,"As a modeler I consider this book less than basic, and of course useless if you want to improve or just learn any kind of technique. There is a lack of unity and coherence among the descriptions.I would describe this book as an introduction for a beginner."
3,puffy de rumba,"i *wish*wish*wish* that puffy de rumba was available somewhere as a single song download. it is the only song on the album that really works for me, but i love it. i'm not going to pay $14 for the whole album. but the puffy de rumba? so fantastic. i saw the hilarious, artful video on linktv and was hooked. pls - do you know how i can get the single song? mail me! eeegenie@hotmail.com"
2,Abba Echoes,"Puffy Amiyumi seem to be interpreting Abba and Echobelly, and I don't hear anything new. If you want to hear good Japanese pop, check out Pizzicato 5 and earlier Shonen Knife, both of which have much more energy and soul than this duo. I also highly recommend the newest Flaming Lips album, which features some Japanimation themes."
2,Not sized for athletic build,"The add photos all show well fitting tops with in shape models, but they fit like a tent! I'm a XXL in all my shirts and many I try on are too tight in the shoulder and arms, but in this line I'd need a medium to fit right. These tops are cut for the obese, not those in shape, so get at least 3 sizes smaller than usual! Price was good, so not worth sending back, gave to goodwill."
1,Disappointing if you had shirts from several years ago.,"I had a similar shirt purchased several years ago which I really liked. Fabric on this one felt cheaper and it does shrink more than the original. The cut is tighter with larger arm holes. The sleves do not fit as well.If you had an older Russel Athletic shirt, don't expect this one to be anywhere as well made.I would suggest you skip this product."
1,The shoulders stick out,"The shoulders stick out several inches past the hole where the arm sticks out. It's like wearing a football jersey without sleeves or pads. Also, the arm holes are too large. Skip it."
3,Good Quality but not long enough.,"I like to use these muscle shirts in the place of the more standard undershirts. However one of the chief things I want is for them to be able to tuck into my pants. I'm fairly tall and have a long torso, so these shirts came to just above my belly button. Not long enough to tuck. Other than that I can't badmouth the quality."
2,"Cheap, and Cheaply made...","$8 isn't much, but this shirt seems to be over very cheap quality, so don't plan to use it everyday, especially if you plan on stretching. My main concerns are the sides. There's a very large cutout for your arm, so if you move your arm slightly others will be able to see your arm pits or whatever which isn't that great unless you are built.Another problem I see is that I ordered a medium...(didn't know the sizes of ""muscle shirts"") So I thought it would be more tight/fitting, because I wear XL T-Shirts. Well it's actually really loose...It fits, but if you want to know the size....XL T-Shirt = Medium Muscle Shirt...Doesn't make much sense, but okay.+ It's comfortable."
4,Great shirt for workouts,"I had troubel finding sleeveless t shirts in my local stores. I knew that Russell was a good brand so I bought a couple to try out. The shirts look good and feel good, but beware that they fit snuggly. I'm a large and that is what I bought. Luckily I'm in pretty good shape, because they do not allow any room for excess in your waistline. If you are a little overweight, you might want to get the next size up from what you normally would buy. Shirts are reasonbly priced and I would buy again."
4,Blend vs cotton,"I bought an assortment of these in 3X. The solid colors are cotton and the heathers are poly blends. Both are comfortable. The polys are lighter weight and shrink less. Sizing is a strange business with today's garments. XL used to fit even the largest people, now shirts go from S to 4X. There is no way to guess what really will fit, so buy one before you buy a bunch or just buy them at a store where you can examine them and try them on."
3,Basically what I ordered,The shirts were basically what I expected. They were a little larger than a normal t-shirt though. Anyway it got the job done.
2,Not For Me,Bought these muscle shirts because I have purchased other Russell shirts. Fit was disappointing. Too much material around arm holes. went back to Russell tank tops.
1,Disatisfied,I ordered 4 (1 Russell ...3 Champion)items based on similar sized garment manufactured by CHAMPION in a large size.This top had shoulder coveridge larger than item pictured in advertisment.
4,Not 100% Cotton,I bought these thinking they were 100% Cotton as advertised. I bought 3-white & 2-graphite. The 3 white were 100% cotton but the 2 graphite were 50-50 cotton and polyester blend. The product is good but I wanted the 100% cotton. I like the Russell brand. Quality has always been great.
4,Nice Product Good Price,"This is just a basic Muscle shirt but its a good price, the sizing runs a little on the bigger side."
1,for hippopotamus,"I couldn't wear because the size is huge. Sizing info is a lie. Is a sac. And is not worth returning the items, I see that they have made this offer to remove stuff."
5,Great Fit - Long Shirt,"I ordered one of these to try, figuring the price was hard to go wrong. I love the fit and length. The fabric has gotten softer with time and washing. Overall, I couldn't be happier with it and will probably order a few more."
2,large arm holes,I have quite large arms and the arm holes on this shirt are humongus not tight fitting as shown. But for the price I'll wear it around home.
5,great service,Arrived quickly and was exactly as ordered. Arrived quickly and was exactly as ordered. Arrived quickly and was exactly as ordered.
3,size is off,"large size is closer to an extra large, otherwise shirt is good fabric, put together nicely. purchase a Russell athletic tee at the time, large true to size."
1,Russell not what they used to be,I have been buying Russell products (especially their Muscle Shirts) for years. But lately I've notice that the quality of both workmanship and materials has really declined. The latest version of their all cotton shirt was poorly sewn and the material was rough and not properly preshrunk. Don't waste your money.
4,athletic mens shirt,gave as a gift. He was glad to get them since it is hard to find sleeveless shirts this time of year
2,Disappointed,When ordering this shirt I did not notice the large armhole inthe picture provided nor in the description. I did not anticipate having the logo on the back either as it was not shown in the picture. I would not buy this product again!
3,"Okay, not great","Product is okay for the price I paid, but fabric is not nearly as nice as another brand I purchased at the same time. It is much bigger than I thought it would be; maybe it will shrink a bit after it is washed and dried so size won't be an issue. Don't know that I would buy this brand again."
1,not 100%cotton,"i purchased these shirts because the description said 100% cotton. they are 53%polyester. for 3 shirts, not worth returning, but i am dissatisfied with the product and the incorrect description."
2,"BEWARE, Different than pictured","the picture shows exactly the kind my son wears, but they will not match his old 1s because they don't have the russell patch on the front. just a plain-o shirt is all :("
2,we learn..,russell shirt not type wanted.fix in the arms is wrong fit.other muscleshirts ok.the fit on basketball shorts are a tight fit.3xxx.
5,Shows off muscles and tattoos,I bought this shirt for my 22 year old grandson. He has tattoos on his upper arms and sometimes he likes for them to show when has a shirt on. He wears this type of shirt winter and summer and I was pleased to find a high-quality one. They wash even in hot water without fading or shrinking.
2,not worth the price,"for the money, you get one shirt. i said, ok, i've got these gift cards, why not get a new lounging around shirt along with my coffee grinder and new book? shirt just isn't as comfortable as you'd demand for the price."
3,Way too big for the size,"I have ordered XL shirt because this is the size I normally wear being a 210 pound guy. The quality is good, but it is at least two sizes bigger than what I can comfortably put on."
4,Decent,"This is a good vest for exercise. Very comfortable and on the loose side. I wouldn't say it's got the feel of 100% cotton, but nonetheless it is a truly good product!"
2,ROUGH MATERIAL.... NOT 100% COTTON...,Straight to the point...Delivery was fair....Shirts fit well...Not satisfied with the material...They should fix that description. Not 100% cotton.It's rough material isn't breathable.Will irritate skin if used to cotton shirts.
3,meh,"The material doesn't feel like cotton. It's very thin. I have some shirts like this from years ago and these are not nearly as nice.Also arm holes are huge. I can put my head through them. If you have big arms that would be a plus, but I found it annoying."
3,varPrimeLover,This muscle shirt just serves the purpose and you get what you paid for. I do not see this last more than 10-12 washes. I have Russel products in the past and have never been a great fan of them. 3 stars for being very affordable. Just gave this a shot but I am disappointed. I am not coming back for more.
1,not worth it,"Could not even use it in a small footed bookcase. Tried first with a chair and slider would not adhere. Tried bookcase then, and it still is very difficult to move around. Advertised for items up to 2500 lbs, bookcase is not even one hundred. Bought with the rectangles ones. Shipping and taxes almost 60% of their price.Will find out if I can still return them. Do not waste your money."
3,a bit of overpriced mediocrity,"I bought this book in Australia, so it WAS expensive. I should have ordered it through amazon.com ...But, it's too late to worry about that.My review:1. Too many silly pictures.2. Too wordy.3. Too little on ""tips and tricks""To be fair, the silly pictures are there to show you the capability of Bryce. Just like those steak knife adverts showing a guy cutting tin boxes and shoes with the knives, these pictures (I agree with the reviewer who said the graphics were hideous. They really are!) serve their purpose well. You don't cut tin boxes with steak knives and you wouldn't use Bryce to create stupid pictures like these. I can't wait to read Kitchens' yet-to-arrive book.Overall comment? Save your money! RTFM!"
2,For beginners only,"There is not much to this book. I supposed someone who has never used Bryce could find some use, but you can pretty much figure out all of this books lessons and examples just by playing around with the program. This is not a book I would recommend buying."
1,Pathetic...again.,"Once bitten, twice shy: after making the mistake of purchasing the Shamm-Man's previous book on Bryce 3D and really regretting wasting my money ...I took a good close look at his newest book to see how bad THIS one could be...I wasn't dissapointed. More of the same as last time: lame tutorials, lame ""examples"" so cheesy that they could easily turn a novice interested in Bryce *away* from trying it it all. I wish I could give this book *no* stars as a rating....Save your money: there are MUCH better free tutorials on Bryce usage on the web."
2,Don't bother buying this,"I'm afraid the only part of the book that I found any use for was the part not written by Shamms Mortier. I'm talking about the section where various artists comment on how they created the pictures in the colour plates section. Unfortunately even this section is mostly made up of pics by the author, and I'm afraid I do not share his tastes in colour, among other things.I have often noticed how people will look everywhere for information on a software, except where they should start: the manual. The Bryce 4 manual is certainly not perfect and there are a lot of advanced features that are not covered, but it is a great introduction to Bryce and 3D in general. You won't find anything in this book that you cannot find in the Bryce manual, except for the occasional mistake."
4,"Excellent book, but not all is correct.","While I have found the book to be quite excellent (very impressive even at first skimming), my disappointment came with the Appendix. Here it claims that there is an update to Bryce 4.0 to 4.1. MetaCreations does not have an update to 4.1. I confirmed this with them. Other than that, I think that the advanced beginner and the more experienced will be able to get something out of the book (or at least off the CD-ROM--objects, textures, materials, etc.) Enjoy Brycers!"
5,Credit due,"I've already submitted my first review on the book. I still think the book is excellent for the advanced beginner and the experienced. I needed to state that MetaCreations JUST updated Bryce 4.0 to 4.0.1. So, now I must update my RATING on this book to 5 stars.Thank you, R. Shamms Mortier, for the great book."
2,Not enough for a book,"While I commend the authors for making a cute cartoon comment on Buddhism and those we humans might think ""beneath us"" (sheep), this is not enough material for a book. It was a serious overexpenditure -- and in *hardback*, no less???This would have made a cute Web site, no more. It takes literally five minutes to read."
3,Joseph Campbell it's not,"Short, cartoonish, and superficial. Little depth to this cute but insubstantial tome. Most memorable quote: ""Karma means there is no escape."" Occasionally humorous, it is finished in a flash. And, like dining on nouveau cuisine, it leaves you hungry for more."
3,Metal Storm,"Most people have never heard of this game. To those that have, it's an underrated gem. It's puzzling why so many passed this game up. The controls are tight, the gravity flip gimmick is cool and the action is frantic. However, the levels feel a bit short and I don't think they used the gravity flip to it's full potential. There is a second quest (remember when games did that?) so that adds some length and it is still a fun game."
1,underwhelmed,"We were excited to purchase this product thinking it would look nice in our newly finished basement. The cheap-looking plastic is reminiscent of an infant tub. Painting it would not work well either since the texture is speckled. After having many guests give negative feedback, we decided it would be much better to put in a drywall niche. Also, note in the product description that ALL SALES ARE FINAL and NO RETURNS ALLOWED."
3,Smokey,The shipping was what it said it would be.The cartridge was slightly stained and smelled of cigarettes.Took a decent amount of cleaning to get it to work.
5,Intriging,"Its a movie that intrigues you... However, you need to pay close attention to this man's life who has hidden secrets which is decifered by this woman psychiatrist..."
3,Fernando Ortega,"Same beautiful voice. Some song choices not to my liking, but thn again, there are songs on the CD I really like. I guess this is not too much help. Mazie Z"
1,product not as described,"I ordered this power supply for my Avocent SwitchView KVM. The product I received, however, was not the SVPS-AM, but rather an imitation. Much worse, the ps was the wrong voltage and amperage! Upon receipt, I immediately called Avocent directly and was told that what I had was not the correct part and that using it could damage the KVM. I'm not sure if Office Depot was trying to cheat me or if this was an honest mistake, but I can say that when I called to arrange for return, there was no apology offered. I recommend avoiding Office Depot."
4,"If you've heard the debut album, you know what you're in for","This single is a prime slice of profane anti-folk. Adam Green and Kimya Dawson again display their minimalist songwriting ability. ""County Fair"" is a blast--1:30 of pure frantic fun. Definitely one of the best Moldy Peaches songs. ""Rainbows"" is a disjointed combination of several song ideas, but still ultimately enjoyable. If [dirty lyrics] are offputting to you, stay far away from this band. If you can enjoy it as part of the Moldy Peaches' deceptively juvenile appearance, then you will find the ""county fair /rainbows"" single to be an excellent addendum to the group's debut album"
5,Just get this... NOW!!!!,"The Stones own. This has Memo From Turner and an awesome sounding mono Jumpin' Jack Flash...What more is there to say, really?"
3,Not in SACD Format,"Contrary to the product title and description, this item is CD-only. If you want the SACD format, look elsewhere. Apparently, ABKCO is responsible for this confusion. [...]"
3,A REAL GEM!,"This is an ABKCO product..chock full of mistakes with bad sound quality....Incorrect versions,a booklet that looks like a child put it together! A TOTAL NIGHTMARE!HOWEVER YOU ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO THE STONES, WHICH WILL SAVE YOU!! FOR THE CASUAL FAN THE REMASTERED ALBUMS , HOT ROCKS1+2, THROUGH THE PAST DARKLY OR BIG HITS HIGH TIDE AND GREEN GRASS will suit you better..FOR THE TRUE FANS I GUESS WE HAVE TO BUY IT AND SHELV IT!! ANOTHER GEM FROM ABKCO!! Thank goodnes they have a new CEO! MAYBE, JUST MAYBE ..WE'LL FINALLY GET WHAT WE NEED!! SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T SEEN AND HEARD BEFORE!! HOW ABOUT SOME OUTAKES OR VINTAGE VIDEO..STILL THE ONLY MAJOR BAND FROM THE 60's WITH NO OUTAKES CDS or DVDs. HEY ABKCO..IF YOU DON'T HURRY..EVERYONE WILL TOO OLD AND WON'TCARE!! AS THE SONG SAYS..I AM WAITING!!!"
2,There are better choices for Rolling Stones GHs.,"This box set was release in the late 80s during the peak of the box sets revival. The problem with the collection here is that it included all of the 45 records on 3 CDs. This may seem like a good ideal, and I will be the first to admit it, I thought it was great until I got it home and started listening to it. The problem is that not only does it included all of the hits, from ""Satification"" to ""Get off my Cloud"" to ""Sympathy For The Devil"", it includes also the B-side of the 45s, which include such songs as ""Little Red Rooster"", ""Jiving Sister Fanny"" and ""Who's Driving Your Plane?"". The issue is not the good stuff, it the filler that kills it. The Stones have way to many great songs, both before and after ""Exile on Main Street"" then to waste time listening to almost half the songs on this album. If you love the stones in the London Years, trade this in for Hot Rocks."
4,Would some one please write a review about this C.D.,Jesus christ would yall people please write a review of the music on this C.D. and stop writing (and complainig) about the sound quality. all C.D.'s sound good thats why they are C.D's yall act like these are old recordings from the 1920's and they need some type of superb remastering I swear .

5,Great for us newbies,"Never canned but as a child I have fond memories of attentively watching my aunt and grandmother do it. I'm big on trying to eat healthy and there's nothing better than fresh homemade or homegrown foods! Summer has come late to Oregon so I haven't really gotten a chance to try it out on anything yet except for applesauce which I made last fall/winter (which is the same time I bought this canner) So far it has worked wonderfully, the instruction booklet has been easy to read and tamed any fears I may have had about the canning process. It doesn't stay all nice and shiny silver once you've used it a few times but there are special cleaners you can get to give it that brand new polished look. Happy canning =)"
5,Home Canning Set,I purchased this home canning set to make my canning job easier - and it does. It is good quality and cleans up well.
1,not what i expected,"not at all what I expected. The canning rack did not fit nicely in my large pot. And once it was used, it rusted at all the seams, leaving my nice stainless steel pot with rust marks as well, that eventually came off with time spent scrubbing. The lid holder as well began to tarnish after the first use. Aren't these items meant to be placed in boiling water for a good amount of time? So they really shouldn't be rusting or tarnishing. Everything else worked fine because it did not need to be placed in water for any duration of time."
3,Looks like a great product but.....,"Bought this with a presser cooker/canner that I had to return as I have a ceramic top stove. The presser cooker/canner did not list online in the description that you cannot use it with a ceramic top stove, but in big bold red letters it stated this fact on the box top."
2,weak soulless funk,"Maybe I'm just not a sax guy, but this album was a let down. Soulless funk with atrociously banal lyrics, I'd have to be incredibly drunk to 'get it on' to this album. Drunk enough that I couldn't hear it playing, that is."
4,Very Good Compilation,"The album does a great job of demonstrating the band's love for an eclectic mix of musical genres: jazz, funk, rock and beyond. Though very good, the album is no substitute for indulging in a KDTU live performance."
3,Groove not on,"KDTU's new offering, ""The Bridge,"" promises to be a letdown for fans of the band's live music. Fan faves such as ""Check out your mind,"" ""Satisfied,"" ""Rise and Shine"" and ""Groove On"" just do not gel as well in the packaged, studio setting. Even with guest appearances from Logic, Chris Wood and several others, this CD lacks the energy that Karl's brings in his live sax and flute solos. His work with Greyboy Allstars is much better (highly recommend GBA Live and West Coast Boogaloo)."
4,Pulpit Communication,"Dr. Carrell accomplishes what she set out to do and did it well. She is not only a professor of communications, but an excellent communicator both in print and in the classroom. This book reveals a wealth of information about the perceptions of preacher and listener alike and has many helpful suggestions for both. As a pastor near retirement I would that this perspective would have been available in my seminary years. The primary weakness for me is that in surveying both Catholic and Protestant, evangelical and liberal, the averaging is not always meaningful. That is, I would like this same survey information from just evangelical preachers and listeners. None-the-less, Dr. Carrell's book demonstrates careful research and is a good start in opening the dialogue between pulpit and pew."
3,"You'll hate playing it, but you'll learn real history","I hated this game. I finished it because I was determined to beat it, and because I hoped that it would end with some kind of actual battle, but it didn't. It's purely educational, but the fact that it's a video game means that you'll want to finish it.I don't have fond memories of the actual game, but I learned a lot from it. In college classes, I remember stuff that I learned for this game. This game is more like school than a Mario game, but if you don't mind that, you really can learn a lot."
4,"Luck or not , seems to work","I was suffering a kidney stone crisis , and the stone (6mm) was at the ureter and was stucked there. It could be luck , but I started to take 5 pills a day , and at the second day , it went out ( it looks the stone splited in 3 little pieces ).The doctor said it would go out without drugs , but , after I took Rowatinex , I felt less pain , and it really seems to work.Lucky or not , I am free of that stone , and there is more 5 or 6 comming , but still inside the kidney with no pain yet.I am just writting this , months after buying the pills , because I am not a believer , but Why not to try ?if you have more questions , I am avaliable to answer."
4,Price is higher than your Ad,"The Amazon Ad on Internet shows $29.50, but the price on your portal shows $39.50, those discrepancies are bad for us the customers, please correct it."
5,Sweet and Sassy,"Sweet as Sugar, Hot as Spice brings the delightful Farrel sisters trilogy to its tantalizing close.Eve Farrel panics at her last unmarried sisters wedding. She figures the only way to get her ultra feminist mom to leave her alone is to pick the most unsuitable man she can find. Enter ladies man Linc Adams Nascar driver.Linc Adams has a major problem of his own. His family wants him to follow in the family tradition and be mayor of his hometown. Linc loves being a Nascar driver so he agrees to marry Eve. He figures Eve's career along as a how to video producer for couples should kill his chances to win the election.Linc and Eve start off their wedding night a little out of sync in the bedroom. Linc sets out to learn how to please Eve and hopefully keep her. Eve realizes there is more to Linc then this good old boy image in projects.From the bedroom to the racetrack this book is funny, sexy and off the charts hot. It was a treat to revisit with the Farrel family again."
3,"Rod and Custom, In The 50's","I have to admit, I was quite disappointed with the selection of articles that were reprinted for this book. The book obviously gives a very ""period correct"" info, since it is the genuine article. The cars are 99 percent California based; lots of show car oriented articles and less technical. Reading over the covers (the table of contents for each issue), there may be some seriously good articles that were skipped entirely."
3,Product Received Was Defective,"The nut tool works great. It's not particularly light but it's the only one with an added knife. This would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I received a defective product.Upon receipt, I was missing the little metal rivet that keeps the knife from over-extending when in the open position. I have contacted Trango about it but they want me to first send them the nut tool before they send out a new one, even though I've sent pictures.Returning to Amazon would take even longer since I didn't realize my product was defective until a few weeks of use. I will have to wait until the end of the climbing season before I send this in to Trango to get it fixed."
2,A Romance Junkie,"The hero's name was Sholto ( how in god's name do you pronounce that hideous name ?) and I just never warmed up to this guy. Maybe around the last pages when he stopped acting like a total jackass. Molly was a total ding bat, doormat, uneducated country bumpkin who didn't trust her fiancé at all- well maybe she wasn't so stupid there because he was an ass. I hated this book and I would recommend it only as a sleep agent- read instead of popping sleeping pill, trust me the book will work faster."
2,Truly struggled with this one,"I've been reading this author's books all week and kind of know what to expect (and I like her books) but this H had very little to redeem himself. He was so harsh with the h all the way along and it was very difficult to see that he'd loved her all along. Why would he treat her like that? If this were the real world, I doubt this marriage would last."
4,Yummy Scientist seeks Goofy Girl!,"Keir Traherne was a grumpy scientist buried away in the African jungle for years and years, working on some sort of boring scientific project. The last thing he wanted was a long-legged girl photographer like Poppy mucking about, taking pictures and turning all the boys' heads. But the more firmly Keir tried to put Poppy in her place, the more often they bumped together, rubbing against each other in his jeep or on the jungle trails, arguing and fighting until their lips just kept locking in those long, hot, embarrassing kisses!If you're the romantic type at all, this is the perfect read for a long hot bath, or when your'e lying in bed with a box of chocolates on a cold rainy night. I loved it!"
3,Jen_X,"This was a good book, but I think it would have been better if I had read it when it came out. I had read all of Jenny's other books, prior to this (as I a big fan of her work) so this was a lot of repeat stories which are included in some of her later books."
3,Jen-X: Jenny McCarthy's Open Book,"Product was a little more beat up than described, however this book was hard to find & I absolutely adore the honesty & entertainment of Jenny McCarthy!"
1,Not happy with this company,"Very disappointed with this vendor. Ordered a foldaway sewing box and received a clothing shaver instead (??). If you want something, go find it elsewhere and save yourself time, money and frustration. I couldn't contact the vendor, so I have a clothing shaver now. :/"
2,NEVER RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT...,"I WAS INFURIATED WITH THIS TRANSACTION...THE INTENDED PRODUCT NEVER GOT TO ME! I WAS REFUNDED MY MONEY WHEN THEY SENT ME THE INCORRECT PRODUCT, BUT ALL I WANTED WAS FOR THEM TO JUST SEND ME WHAT I ORDERED, NOT REFUND MY MONEY AND LEAVE ME AT SQUARE ONE WITHOUT THE PRODUCT I NEEDED & ORDERED IN TIME FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE THAT HAD A TIME CONSTRAINT...VERY MAD & FRUSTRATED WITH THIS INTERACTION, ESPECIALLY SEEING AS I TRIED TO BE VERY CLEAR WHEN I CONTACTED THEM IN MESSAGES, AND I CONTACTED THEM ABOUT 4 TIMES TOO!!!"
4,Holds your interest with setting and characters,"Plot: After suffering an injury that affects her memory and causes her to see things, Amelia travels from bleak wintry England to the Greek island where her estranged mother lives with two other women. While there she continues to see strange sights, and as a seasonal storm comes along and cuts the island off from the world, the strange occurances increase and Amelia finds herself wondering if she is really delusional or seeing actual supernatural phenomenon.Review: Easy to read and with believable characters (although a little too much time is spent pre-island), this is a good read for those who enjoy a dash of the supernatural in their tales. As is often the case, the ending is a bit of a let-down, but it was still an enjoyable read."
5,Brutal!!,"A band that is quite talented and doesn't have any weak tracks...Disgorge. I remenber when i first heard ""consume the forsaken"" i thought to myself? Excellent, with originality and the best disturbing sound that any one into outer death/grind can ask for and expect nothing less then amazing work. Technical sound with such a great drummer and one mean vocalist, can't go wrong! Highly recommended!"
5,Christianers sound pretty good! Great quality cd,I actually bought it as a gift for someone. HE WEARS IT OUT! I have no complaints.
4,More from the little Jazzsinger,"This album proves what all Ani fans have been suspecting since To The Teeth, that she is no longer a folksinger, but a jazz musician. Wouldn't recommend for first time Ani listeners, cause it'll ruin '32 Flavors' for you forver, and you'll probably get irritated that she just seems to have neglected to tune her guitar on more than one occasion. Go for Living in Clip if you want live, Out of Range for older school acousticy ani, or Up x6 for some more techy work. For more familiar fans, this album is worth buying for the live performance of 'You Had Time' alone."
4,Great Album,"I love the new album. Its a great piece of work. I always enjoy listening to Ani. Of course I love all her great songs like 32 flavors,dilate and jukebox.I highly recommeded if you like this album to check all the others out."
2,Mediocre,"I recently bought this album. I thought how much i enjoyed living in clip and perhaps this album wouldsorta be similar, but no! its like shes covered all of her old stuff with this new jazz thing shes going for. If You're a fan of jazz, maybe you will like this album and her previous album Revelling and Rekoning. but for soem1 like me who fell in love with ani's simplistic early accoustic stuff, this is not for you. in some ways i got really annoyed with the way that she's done this to her songs because it detracts from th fact that her lyrics are so profound. sometimes it feels like there are jsut too many instruments playing at once. also in LIC, i enjoyed ani's little comments, but it seems theres not as much of that in this. i did however like the WTC poem, self evident, and not a pretty girl which was not so greatly changed."
3,its an okay CD,"I have all of Ani's music, but I really don't like this disc as much as others of hers. I think if you want a great Ani disc, grab Livin in a clip, thats her best one."
1,Why???,"Songs Rushed!...Cries Of Angst from Previous Albums GoneNo sense of urgencyNone of her infamous GritLeast Impressive Of All Ani AlbumsNot A New DirectionJust ""Faster-Monotone-Lackluster-Colder"" versions of Classic Ani SongsEvery Version Of Every Song Sounds ConvictionlessNo words to hang onto although their still there.These versions slip right by you ""not through you"" without hesitation.Maybe she dosn't have to think about what the words to her songs mean anymore and she just goes through the motions now. Lets Hope Not."
2,completely un-necessary,"I'm a huge Ani DiFranco fan and have been for many years. Unfortunately, I was not at all impressed with this album. I wasn't a big fan of her two disc ""Revelling/Reckoning,"" and this album is mainly just a rehash of that album. She took the worst songs from that album (""Aint That the Way,"" ""What Where Who When,"" ""Tamboritza Lingua"") and gave us live versions of them, and ruined more than one of her classics (""Dilate,"" ""32 Flavors,"" ""Letter to a John""). Basically, this album was entirely un-necessary and you'd be wise to skip it. Get Living in Clip, get Dilate, get any Ani album but this one."
2,"Sadly not ""Living in Clip"" part Two","This album will do much to increase the ""Ani is the female Dylan"" hype. Like his Bobness, Ani often tries to reinvent herself, tours relentlessly, inspires loyal dedication in her fans and now (as this release proves) can't choose a good live set of tracks to save herself.I loved Ani's last live release (Living in Clip) which I picked up before I had the chance to see her live. I gave LIC four stars but then I had no point of comparison. When this release was announced I was looking forward to hearing some of the inspired versions of great songs that I had seen at live shows. Sadly the songs here do nothing to inspire the way ""Clip"" did and leave me fondly remembering concert highlights that for some reason were overlooked in favour of the dud tracks presented here. This is definitely Ani's version of ""Dylan and the Dead"" and is best overlooked in favour of the far superior concert releases avaliable on her official site."
3,a letdown somehow,"I love ani and have seen her several time in concert, but some how this album was a bit of a let down, now don;t get me wrong, some of the songs were incredible, like Grey and the new Self Evident. but there was something about the new arrangements and tempos that were truly crass. maybe i just don't like change and i am a firm believer in the less is more camp. which is why i really enjoyed her recent solo tour and look forward to another one. i really would have like to hear more from that set list than the new band. but nothing is static, everything is falling apart"
2,Ugh,"You MUST be a fan to enjoy this. One of the worst guitar sounds I've ever heard in a professional recording. I knew Ani was a love her/hate her performer, but a couple of her full acoustic songs I had heard weren't too bad. I got this record from <a href=""http://www.swaprocks.com"">Swaprocks.com</a> (thankfully I didn't pay for it). Very disappointing. The songwriting is quirky, and the lyrics intricate, but didn't work for me. If you're sure you like her music you may have a better chance at finding this release enjoyable."
5,"Out with the New, in with the Old as if it were new","It's good to have the old Ani back. This is a truly superb CD, giving new fans exposure to the old folk sound that branded Ani. What's more, the new stuff is chilling, powerful, and packed with meaning. This is what we've come to expect from Ani, and this is what she delivers, again. ""Grey"" will speak to a lot of listeners, as will the rest of the old and new tracks on this CD."
2,remember me?,"Some years ago, ani's fans were described as being ""fiercely loyal"" and protective of their little folksinger. Yeah, I was one of those. I was one of those who looked disdainfully of the ""new crowd,"" I was one of those who started to trickle away. But, I pledged to retain my loyalty as my peer faulted, I promised to remain faithful to the orator.I regret to say that this is the first album that I didn't get excited about and wait for. I regret to say that this may be the first album that I will not buy.So much of the sound and message that ani used to share with her listeners is gone, and this album is a sorrowful reminded of how now, even in her live performances, she is only that--a performer."
5,Nordic Fire & Brimstone - Outstanding!,"A fantastic live recording. Lien keeps the melodic fire of tunes like ""Old Larry"" and ""Wackidoo"" (here the opening of the title track) white-hot while substantially improving both songs, twisting the former into something longer and more interesting than the original and dispensing with the noodling prog-rock flourishes that marred the studio version of the latter.Rasch is the other standout talent here, although all the musicians form an organic, sympathetic collaboration for this wonderful violinist."
2,Another view,"This author is obviously very well versed in alot of material as you know from everything he has written. He remarks that he will only use from acupuncture what is real and forget the hocus/pocus. I feel that Mr Chaitow highly underestimates the powers of acupuncture medicine. I am a western trained physician who has just trained in this ancient wonderful world of acupunture. There is no methodical or conceptual description for point selection, but a mere lists of points for pain in areas of the body. For headaches-points A,B & C. For backpain--points X,Y & Z, etc. I have no regrets in the purchase, but I like it only to supplement my other material."
2,An attempt to remove the ability to freely speak,"The book, while well written and apparently persuasive to those who are easily swayed by sentimental and emotional arguments, simply gives a one-sided view on why the first ammendment does not give ""free speech"". As Justice Burger said, ""No law means no law"", and the authors tend not to agree. Read for a laugh."
1,Anti-Semetic and Racist in nature,"The author suggests that the Nazi's had it right when it came to free speech & that the US should institute policies suggesting if you have any speech that the government doesn't approve of, you should be guilty of breaking the law. what a scumbag nazi.""Speech in any sort of meaningful sense requires equal dignity, equal access, and equal respect on the parts of all of the speakers in a dialogue; free speech, in other words, presupposes equality. The authors argue for a system of free speech which takes into account nuance, context-sensitivity, and competing values such as human dignity and equal protection of the law."""
5,Dinner In Italy,"I provide,Background Music,for a Local Club,during,Their Spaghetti Dinners,and,the Mandolin,Italian Melodies,in this Collection,help create,the Perfect Ambiance."
2,mediocre sound quality!,"the music on this disc is not CD quality. If you are wanting background music to be played on a boombox, than this CD should meet your needs. But if you are looking for an aural delight that matches your palate for Italian cuisine than this probably will disappoint. My 2 star rating is for the production not the performance."
2,Recap of movie monsters,"This book wanders over the landscape of monster movies that came out before its 1978 publishing date.It covers the usual who's who of werewolves, vampires, mummies, as well as giant bugs, Godzilla, King Kong, and a random assortment of less iconic monsters (such as the crab-men).There isn't much substance here-- each section recaps the major plot points of a couple of movies, tosses out a few somewhat interesting facts (did you know that Christopher Lee played Dracula a record 7 times?), and moves on.The prose is easy to understand, and has the peppy entertainment value of a teen magazine.Each short chapter also includes a couple of black and white photographs featuring the monsters being discussed.In short, there's no practical reason to own this book. Like many reference books, this has been eclipsed many times over by other, more comprehensive efforts in print, and even more so by the internet."
1,The best Mega Man game ever? I think not.,"So this is considered the greatest Mega Man game ever. Really? I mean, REALLY? No one has the balls to be objective? I guess not, so I'll have to do it. Suffering from ""more of the same"" syndrome, Mega Man 2 was little more than a retread of that which made the first Mega Man as irritating as it was, but a bit more playable, focused and inspired in the level structures, bosses and other necessities. Gravity is still a harsh mistress to the Megster and the overall look of the game is still very mid-80s NES dreckish, but it was around this time that the series started to better itself by way of adding a few more elements to the series, namely the 8 boss rule, the various little tools that helps Mega Man traverse hard-to-reach areas, and those blessed E-Tanks. Nevertheless, Mega Man 2 did really nothing more than keep the franchise afloat for another game until things started to REALLY take off..."
2,Sadly mediocre,"This book has promise: bios on a wide variety of players, from the Majors to even a few guys in college or indy ball. But, the assessments occasionally contain inaccuracies or outdated information that makes this book a secondary source, at best. The Baseball Prospectus offers a better (albeit more sabremetrically oriented - which isn't everyone's cup of tea) look at a player's talent level - the STATS books are better at describing their tools. Still, worthwhile if you buy multiple books of this nature per year (as I do)."
5,Like!,"I like adding on to my daily routines and this dvd is perfect for a little extra ab work. I really like Denise Austin, she is easy to follow and she has a cheery personality. This is a great dvd for anyone who would like a little added bonus to their daily routine or for a beginner who is just getting started."
3,belly blasters again,although I liked all of the workouts I did not realize it was a repeat of several old DVD's all put together for the abs. I already had these same workouts on previously purchased DVDs and did not see anything new.
3,Not the best I've seen,"I appreciate the sporadically tough but manageable workout this DVD provides, and I definitely appreciate being able to turn off her incessant talking during the workouts.The routines were easy enough, but seemed to be rushed together with minimal repetitions... to the point that I did not feel like I got a thorough workout.Would have been good as a rental DVD to pawn ideas from, but not a good purchase all around."
2,20 minuites duration only,"I purchased this DVD looking for variety of Abs workout, I was very dissapointed!The different segments are not actually different they are mostly the same excersizes but with different atmosphere and background !I was surprised as to how commercial this DVD is! The actual duration I would say is maybe 15 minuites in total, all excersizes are repeated.I do not recommend this DVD. It's no value for money."
4,Love denise austin but I have all these videos,"I bought this video thinking great a DVD that has all ""new"" ab workouts in one place. I was disappointed to know that all these 7 workouts are on her other DVDs. Its nice to have them in one place but I own all the other DVDs so it kind of a waste of money. I admit that I do pull this one out as its convenient instead of finding which one I want to do.If you don't really have any Denise Austins videos this is a great DVD as it has some great workouts on it. Denise Austin is great instructor. Very personable and friendly. She is always smiling and makes the workouts fun."
3,Great!,"This is tough, but fun and I love it. If you are in for a good workout, this is it. Stuff for all levels. These require a floor mat for working on. I love Denise Austin's workouts!"
3,Can she be a little more annoying?,"Okay, I'll admit. I'm a complete stranger to these ab workouts- which is why for the first several times I use it, I need the volume up so I can hear the instruction. Well, there's a little problem with that. She needs to lay off the caffiene! These are great workouts for a beginner, and I have seen results- BUT I cannot stomach her overly peppy voice. Instead of feeling pumped like after my cardio and strength training, I get up off the mat just feeling really annoyed. I think I need to find another DVD."
1,very dissappointed,I have purchased many of Denise Austin's older videos and have been very pleased but this video is by far the worst. She shows four segments on the video but does the same routines for each one just wearing a different outfit! What a waste of space and money.
4,Great workout,Definitely recommend - you can do a different ab workout everyday if you want and all are tough and effective.
3,"Effective, but too repeatative","If you have other Denise Austin DVD, especially any pilates, you've seen all these moves. Even worse, all of these work-outs are almost identical. I love that they are all only 10 minutes, and are effective. However, it's like doing the same routine over and over again. I like variety. Thankfully, I got this DVD during a REALLY good sale. It's not worth more than $5."
1,A memory from the past,"I had always remembered ""Falling in Love Again"" on an old, old Marlene Dietrich recording I had in my college days. For Christmas this year my husband tracked down a recording with this song and I must admit that I was extremely disappointed with the scratchy sound track. I had hoped that in some electronic way it had been digitally improved, but not so!"
4,Gas can cap,The cap was exactly what I was looking for so I could continue to safely use my older gas can.
5,Excellent--wish there were more in the series.,"I thoroughly enjoyed House of Cards. I found out after I had read it that there was a previous book in the series, Crime of Passion, and read it also. It was a twisty plot without the gruesomeness that accompanies so many mysteries. I wish there more titles in this series. As far as I know, however, there is not."
3,So so...,"I read the first edition of this book, and contains several errors, such as mistaking the first names of two famous sisters, things like that. I understand there is a second edition, with most of the errors corrected, pity it is not availble here. Errors aside, it makes good reading.-"
1,You have got to be Kidding,"This might be the last time that I buy an item based on someone's feedback. My Son and I were very much looking forward to receiving this item. The Sound and story telling is awful, my husband can read a story better than this. The cover is from some cheap sticker material printed on a Ink jet printer hand cut and applied. The same thing applies to the CD's. This product truly has the look feel and sound of someone creating this at his or her home. The listening experience is terrible we just turned it off. This is a very disappointing CD set and a complete waste of money. Did the owner write the previous review???"
2,Paint by Number,"I took a class using Classroom in a Book as the text. I enjoyed the class, and was able to do all of the lessons with no problem. However, when I attempted to do my own projects, I realized that my learning had not been a continuum of skills, but a,""How good are you at following step by step directions course."" I then went through Photoshop Studio Techniques, doing every example on my own, and learned how to use Photoshop."
4,Useful,Good concepts and instructions; went along well with my class.I would recommend it to others. I passed it along to other students.
2,A waste of time - too confusing for new users,"I teach Photoshop at the local college and have complained to my adminstrator about the use of this book for our level one classes. The lessons are too long, and introduce too many different features of Photoshop at one time. I've found that students appreciate a linear approach, and want to master the essentials of one topic before they move on. The lessons in this book ""skip"" around so much that my students get lost easily, and I've reorganized many of our lessons as a result. As well, it often ignores the ""why"" of a feature, and focuses instead on the ""how"". Inquisitive students want both questions answered. Adobe Photoshop is fabulous, but this book is not. I'd recommend that a beginner use the Visual Quickstart Guide instead."
1,Where the lesson is leading isn't clear from the beginning,"If there are those out there who have read: ""Adobe Photoshop 6.0 Classroom in a Book"" ISBN 0-201-71016-1and disliked it as much as I did, please submit reviews of better books you've found.I got the impression that, that book tried it's best to make sure you had very little idea of what the lesson was leading up to until the very last sentence. The problem with this method is that it makes understanding and following the lesson much more difficult because you have little idea of what it's leading up to.Using it as a reference is pretty much impossible. You can't just pick up the book and go to a point of interest and learn that topic. It seems like you have to start at the beginning of the book just to get the sence of something in the middle or end of the book. Frankly, what a piece of crap. Thanks for any recommendations."
3,photoshop,Had been using Photoshop without a book for some time. Found that the things I wanted to know or do were difficult to locate and accomplish. I have seen better manuals.
3,Adobe Photoshop 6.0 Classroom in a Book,"The software on the CD-ROM included with this book is faulty. The automatic installation of Adobe Type Manager with Post Script fonts failed. Adobe Type Manager could not be installed because a required file is missing from the CD-ROM. This file is: ""FONTS\atm_9x\ATMENU.HLP"". There may be other problems with the software but I got no further with the automatic install because of this roadblock. The Lessons installed OK. I've just started working with the lessons so it is too early for me to review the rest of the book."
3,"Good for ""How?"" not ""Why?"" or ""What?""","If you want the practice and need a step-by-step lesson, this is a good book. I did want the step-by-step practice, and I'm still glad I bought the book. However, it only tells you what to do. It's not very good at explaining why you're doing it or what exactly the overall effect will be. Also, any tool, filter, etc. that you don't learn about in the lessons, you don't really learn about at all. I think it's a great book for practice, but it's probably best used in conjunction with another book that doesn't have lessons but gives a better explanation of the tools, what they do, and when and why to use them. An example is probably Photoshop 6 For Dummies. I haven't bought it yet, but I've looked through it, and I think it will be helpful if used along with Classroom in a Book."
5,great stuff,"this is the album that really turned me on to ymsb. as a banjo ""bluegrass"" player i can't stress the level of difficulty,and speed at which this group plays at consistently. their material is inspiring, catchy, and genre bending. you dont have to be a bluegrass fan to enjoy this music. check out ""dawn's early light"" ""2 hits"" ""peace of mind"". give this band a chance or see em' live while they're still playin hot."
3,an early edition,I have not really played this game except for a little while. It is the NES version which is pretty archaic. It is good if you like old school games.
2,Didn't work in 20 degree tent,"I don't know if I have a defective ProCat, or if they all do this, but when I took it camping to New Mexico in the freezing winter (about 20 degrees), and tried to use it to heat up my 12'x12' tent, it didn't heat the tent. Instead, noxious smelling propane gas was leaking into the tent. The gas leak started after the screw-in propane tank started to freeze over. It became an ice-cube. I don't know if a gas leak caused it to freeze over, or if the ProCat can't handle these temperatures.Overall, I was excited to use this product, but it failed my hopes and expectations."
5,Works just like the original,"This is not a knock-off, but the genuine article. It works just fine, and I am very pleased with the purchase."
1,not so complete,"Maybe it's a good reference guide to the most common houseplants, but when I want to look up a new plant I just brought home, it's never in there. I find myself looking them up online more often than the book."
4,Handy,Found this to be handy to have around when I'm wondering about caring for some of my houseplants!
2,.......broke.....,"Like many have stated in their reviews, the same has happened to me. It broke after about a weeks worth of use. This was actually my first Doc Johnson item and it certainly will be the last. :-/ The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did satisfy me for that week. :-P"
3,Broken!,"great product but mine is broken!it has not even been a year, i bought it last fall and you can tell the wires on the inside dont connect like they are supposed to because the lights turn on, on the remote but no response.otherwise it was amazing while it worked..."
2,The cord breaks inside,"The description is wrong because it's 4 speeds, but the texture of the plastic and vibration settings are really nice. Unfortunately the cord likes to break on the inside so it'll stop working if you nudge the cord. I really really liked it until it broke."
2,not worth your money,"I bought this because I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on a toy, and I've always had success with bullets in the past. But it's very poorly constructed, and it broke after two months of using it sparingly. It seems like most inexpensive vibes on the market today aren't made to last, so I ended up just caving and putting some more money a Lelo, which I've had for a year and it still works great. I figured it was better to just invest in a toy that will last rather spending the same amount per year on toys that will break after a month or two. Better for the environment that way and reduces my own frustration. ;)"
5,It Does It!,"I'd like to thank all the reviewers who helped me make this choice. The coating is very pleasant to the touch. The cord is nice and long. I found the lowest setting to be more than enough. There's no ""out of the box"" plastic smell. And so far it's also extremely quiet. Very happy with my choice."
3,great percussion,"The percussion pieces are really outstanding and highly recommended. The thrash metal piece is effective but annoying. The satanic ritualistic choirlike song is just plain scary, even if you do not believe in the devil. I guess its funny, but really its so scary that its hard to see the humor in it.disappointed with the album as it seems to be really just a kitschy ""theme"" album thats overdone. ends up taking you nowhere you want to be."
4,Jennifer Charles Alert,"If you're contemplating buying this because of Jennifer Charles's presence, know that she sings only one song, ""Lucifer Rising,"" but it's stunning. As she seductively whispers the vocals, she is backed by a female choir: one of the best tracks on the album. The rest are instrumentals, ranging from percussion workouts to a death-metal thing (fortunately, one of the shorter tracks). A fine album to own, whatever your tastes, and a must for those of us who worship Jennifer Charles."
5,Brilliant!,Everything Zorn does is brilliant. This release is no exception. On IAO we are on a carriage ride through the world of Aleister Crowley as seen through the camera of Kenneth Anger. I believe this is the soundtrack to the scariest film that never was. I have practically everything Zorn has put out and I would have to say this is one of his best. I guarantee that with every play you will find more sounds and textures to explore. Zorn is the man and this is the album. Buy it.
4,girl group stuff,"this CD features girl group songs, but not the ones you hear every day on the oldies station on the radio. All the songs are about girls being in love with guys who are no good (Chico's Girl, Daddy You Just Gotta Let Him In), , teenage love angst, a vocal version of the theme from Mission Impossible (!), and the movie The Silencers (!) as well as one of the weirdest girl group songs ever, Egyptian Shumba by The Tammy's (who sang back up on the old Lou Christy records. If you're looking to hear anything besides girl group sounds, then try another CD....."
5,"A robust blend, and authentic.","I've visited Ostfriesland, and this is as close as you'll find to the local 'broken silver' variety. This is an extremely robust tea, meant for stoking a hardy people on cold, wet mornings. Meant to be made strong and drunk with quantities of milk and rock sugar along with a variety of cakes and desserts, three cups are mandatory for a visiting guest, and only then do you remove your spoon from the cup, signalling that you're done.SpecialTeas ships phenomenally fast to Boston, and I've never had a problem with the order. There's always an extra sample of a new blend included. You should also order some of their rock sugar to accompany it, as it is a pain to find kluntjes in the U.S."
4,Tactical Ops--could have been better but still a nice figure,"The Tactical Ops is a very requested and the final clone figure for Revenge of the Sith. Number 65 marks the last of these stormtrooper relatives that we can find on a basic card. Good luck with that. The Tactical Ops seems in general to be an improvement over the Jedi Temple figures with a removable helmet and a much better paint job but there are a couple negatives:Originally wer were shown a Super Articulated incredibly painted prototype at the Comic Con. They dropped the ball with the produced figure looking nothing at all like the original protoThe accessories are a bit unexciting(just a blaster, base and helmet)The leg gets inwardly bent unlike the Tank Gunner (which is the same mold)The articulation, again is not balljointed in the arms.Overall a cool army builder but not even one of the best."
2,overpriced!,"this camera is very big and has a tiny screen. it loads things very slow and the pictures never really turn out that good. im surprised that people are still selling it when there are newer, nicer cameras for half the price."
2,Not very happy,"This is my second digital camera (I also have an Apple Quicktake 150). I was looking for 1M pixel + with optical zoom and USB and this camera looked great. What I found was that it does not do well with ""low"" light (the school cafeteria with no flash is what I'm refering to as ""low""). Images were grainy and blurred. It is also very slow. Don't expect to quickly turn it on and take a picture. Then I went to take family photos and found that there is no timer function! The included software seemed incomplete (as if this newer model had not been added). It installed a control panel with no functionality for this model and other software features also did not work (I haven't got the firmware update to work yet either)."
3,Good Camera,i bought this camera about 1 hour after i bougt this.first i tell u the bad things abut this product:1. the digital zoom is not go cuz the picture goes blury.thats it.second the good things:1. normal zoom is cool2. high quilty pictures even better than the Polaroid PDC 1.320 megapixel camera even though thats the same megapixels.3. the lens are really made of glass4. pictures in the LCD is real colourand 5. USBthats it
2,Not a great camera,"This was my first digital camera, and I'm sending it back. I was searching for a digital camera that would take good close up pictures. This isn't it. They get blurry and the pictures are not sharp and clean. It feels like a cheap toy. The buttons wouldn't work half the time and I would have to turn the power off and on again to make them work. The docking system was nice because it recharged the batteries, but it's not any more convienient than a plain USB connection. The one time I used the transfer button on the dock it completely restarted my computer. In every indoor picture I took, the flash made this huge, blinding white spot, no matter what mode it was in. Another thing that bothered me was that there is no lens cover. If you're looking for quality sharp, clear photos, this isn't the way to go."
5,"The Incomparable ""Artaud""","Luis Alberto Spinetta may have created some of the most challenging and aesthetically profound music for thirty plus years, but ""Artaud"" can be considered his crowning achievement. Despite still performing under the ""Pescado Rabioso"" moniker, he alone is the composer and performer on this album. Even though he doesn't completely discard elaborate rock compositions in this album, the truly magnificent songs are the ones he displays on acoustic guitar. ""La sed verdadera"" and ""Cantata de los puentes amarillos"" can be considered the foundation upon which ""Artaud"" is built on. Few latin american musicians have been able to provide true musical innovation; in truth, ""Artaud"" is one monument that proves to be too big to topple."
5,seems not out-dated,"Take elements of Queen, Led Zeppelin, Mike Oldfield mix them together with lyrics in Castellano and you may have something resembling this album. Instrumentally stripped back, and at the same time canvassing many genres including rock and blues, this is one very cool album. Although released in 1973, for me (first time listener) it seems still fresh and current. It is a shame that it is so short (not considering that vinyl was limiting in this way). I have listened to a lot of 70s and 80s Argentine rock over the last year and this is certainly a stand-out album. This CD comes in a thick paper slip case with a lyric insert."
4,Interesante,"LLama la atencion como siendo de finales de los 60's tiene canciones donde denota un ritmo fuera de su tiempo, mas adelantado a su epoca (como en el caso de Bajan, Las habladurias del mundo y cementerio club). Excelente disco, pero siempre recuerden que es rock de los 60's."
3,You're not alone!,"I bought this book just a few months after beginning my first long distance relationship. I thought it would be helpful, give me ideas and tips in how to handle the distance. Which it did! It is a very well written book and some of the stories have made me laugh out loud.However, a few of the passages made me depressed! I started taking this book too seriously and began to rush the relationship. I finally realized it and before it was too late I was able to calm myself down.This is a good book, take it for what it is - a suggestion and a reminder that your not alone - not the be-all/end-all of relationships."
2,It's a self-help book,"This is more of a self-help book than anything else. Honestly, if you don't already know the advice that this book offers, you really need to reconsider whether you're ready to be in a relationship at all. It also doesn't have many suggestions for things to do for or with your partner via long distance. It's just a book of common sense."
1,boring and lame,"If you are looking for a clinical psychology book that uses science and theory to counsel in relationship matters, this is not the book for you! This book is mostly filled with 'he said, she said' stories and endlessly repeats the same concept by only changing the words. I was bored and my intelligence insulted while reading it."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be!,"This book does not help those who have begun their relationship long distance. It has solutions for those who were together and then moved away from each other but all in all, the solutions provided are not very practical and many are just common sense."
3,"how to do love, long-distance","This book is a quick read: it has good information on the how to's of managing challenges of a long distance relationship.Much of the material contained is common sense stuff, and many commentaries come from couples who have already been through it - which is useful to read for anyone thinking of engaging in a long-distance relationship.There are holes for any relationship that doesn't fit the ""usual"" long-term situation (e.g., such as when one member of an already established couple moves for school or employment reasons, expected to last maybe a year or two)... If you fall off the bell curve, you'll be out of luck trying to find help for your situation here."
2,I agree,I felt this was a rushed project too! Eddie is one of the baaddest musicians in the COGIC and this project could have been much better.
2,Harrumph,I don't know if it's us or them but we can't make it fit. I am still trying to figure out if they sent us the wrong one or if we ordered the wrong one or if my very mechanical car guy is somehow missing something on the install.... Jury is still out.
4,"Good product, but could use better clips","This is a good replacement regulator. The only problem I had was I had to use the old spring clips that hold the window to the regulator. The ones they supply are not spring metal, so they wont hold the window. The new ones might hold for awhile, but they will eventually fail, its best to reuse your old clips, or get new ones from a dealer."
4,Dorman window regulator,"Mother-in-laws car did the same as everyone else's here. She went out to find her drivers door window down. I took apart the door to find the metal cables completely unraveled.Unlike everyone else here, I did not recieve the installation manual, or door pins that everyone else seems to have recieved. This looks like a cheaper replacement because it is...as long as it works, I'm definately ok with that.Unfortunately, I didn't recieve the installation instructions or door pins..otherwise it would be a 5. 5 would be same quality as OEM, this is not. 4 because no instructions to install."
5,Even came with door panel clips,"I've ordered several of these door regulators for my 2000 Plymouth Grand Voyager. I'm experienced in changing this part. So getting it in and out is an hour job. This is the first unit that had the door panel clips included to put the panel back in place without a trip to the chrysler dealer. I was pleased with the product, shipping, documentation and performance once I had it installed.no worries"
5,Great way to save $250,"I purchased this item when our Chrysler van had a power window that would randomly quit working. The dealer told me the fix would be over $450 with the part being at least $300. When I searched the internet and found much lower prices for non-MOPAR parts, I decided to take a chance on this item. The dealer installed it for me last week, and it works like a charm! And to think I could have paid over 4 times as much for a factory part. Great product and very reliable."
2,lasted about 8 weeks then broke,"I purchased this window regulator with motor from Amazon in June 2011. I installed it and every thing fit perfectly. However, after working great for about 8 weeks it suddenly stopped working. I took the door panel off and the cable on the regulator was tied up in knots... Only had 30 days to return it for refund so I lost my money. This product needs a longer warranty..."
5,Best Game Ever!,"When i was a kid (im 24 now) this game was so amazing and fun...who cares that the graphics wern't great back then but in this game there is so many senarios you can do...like sending the cassate tape to late night talk show host, (not to mention microwaving random things) Buy this game!!!"
4,Maniac who? Maniac what? It's Maniac Mansion!!,"Honestly, this was one of my favorite video games to play as a kid. Sure time has depleted the usage of the NES, but this was one of the greatest roleplaying games of all time. I remember sitting up late on school nights and playing this game. It always involved different kinds of thinking and strategy. The characters in this game each come with their own unique talent and special little niche. This game definately is worth the price. Well, don't take my advice buy it and try it for youself."
3,Already broken,My daughter enjoys Polly Pockets very much and this set is no exception. Unfortunately one doll's arm broke right away.
1,I can understand...,"...why it was booed, but I can't see how there could be any favorable reviews (and I would not like to meet those who made them). First, where I was expecting music, I could only hear unsufferable noise, and when appeared those supposed to be as Louis XV & XVI, I had more than enough and put this crap where it belonged : in the garbage. Of course, since a lot of garbage lovers seem to look at TV as entertainment and at McDos as restaurants (although they should be listed in phone directories as ""mangers""), no wonder they can appreciate this. If Coppola had any pride, he should stop sponsoring his daughter until she came back to her senses. Unless, of course, he too thinks that crap lovers must have their fill...."
3,Hidden props,"Did anyone else see the high tops sneakers planted amoung the other fabulous shoes.. Up to that point I thought it was a good movie, to add a hidden prop like that just ruined the validity of the film for me...shame"
2,beautiful but insubstantial,"Despite my intuition that this was going to be a bad movie, I watched it anyway. My intuitions weren't wrong though. Kirsten Dunst's acting is spotty - varying from good to unbelievable to horrible. This film was pretty bad - the storyline was flimsy, historical facts were adjusted or conveniently eliminated, the ending was anti-climactic, the acting from the rest of the cast was mediocre at best. The only exception is perhaps Joan Cusack, but her performance is so brief and hardly her personal best. The soundtrack was highly inappropriate and actually detracted from whatever goodwill the movie managed to generate with its outstanding sets. Furthermore, the one thing that must be said about this movie is that the costumes were exceptional and rightly Oscar-nominated. In the end this is hardly surprising - it says a lot about the movie when the shoes (Manolo Blaniks) are more likely to be discussed than everything and anything else about the movie."
3,Sofia Coppola's weakest delivery so far,"Perhaps I am setting a high bar for Sofia Coppola, talented actress, writer and director. Surely, after her highly successful ""Lost in Translation"" movie for which she won an Oscar for screenplay we were all expecting a lot from her. While this movie relished in beautiful costumes, interior design and architecture, it totally misses on providing a more suitable musical score or background on French Revolution and the mob that offed this unfortunate queen. I do not understand the awe about Kristen Dunst's performance. I found Danny Huston and Jason Schwartzmann's performances to be superior in spite of the fact that their roles were smaller."
2,"Good Acting, Bad Plot","Kirstin Dunst is awesome in this movie, but the movie itself was slow and boring for me. The only reason to watch it is because of her."
5,Terrific Movie for the New Millineum,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film and the 2+ hours passed quickly. It depicted Marie Antoinette as what she most likely was - an awkward teen forced by birth into a lifestyle she at first found scary and confusing, then confining, and ultimately decadently boring.Her introduction to the French court was brilliantly filmed to resemble a young girl entering as a freshman into a new high school. Curious looks, sneers, whispering...all the elements of classic teen judgment. Madame du Barrie was the popular slutty girl the football captain (King Louis XV) was dating and the rest of the court was the popular crowd Marie Antoinette was forced into by circumstance.Kirsten Dunst was wonderful as the doomed Dauphine and her Swedish lover was HOT HOT HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I plan to show this to my nieces (ages 14 and 11). They'll enjoy it even more than I did, I'm sure!"
2,BOOOOOO!!!,"If, one day you find yourself on deathrow; denied your stay of execution, instead of ordering your last meal, ask for Marie Antionette. This movie never ends. Sophia Coppola is working on becoming a very good filmmaker, but this is not one of her best efforts. However, the costumes were nominated for an Academy award and are quite an achievement and also the reason behind my two star rating. Otherwise, this movie was a bore and a disappointment."
5,Beautiful post-modern art!,"I seriously cannot believe how many people hated this movie. Hellloooo! It's _suppose_ to be a whimsical, post-modern 80's-inspired punk take on the crazy life of Marie Antoinette. People who don't appreciate this style will obviously hate this movie! Sofia Coppola's other works are not the same style, so just because you like The Virgin Suicides or Lost in Translation does not mean you'll like this one as well. With that said, the choices in music, costume, lighting, etc. are flawless. Sofia Coppola nails it! I loved Kirsten Dunst's light-hearted, simple and natural acting; you almost feel like she's NOT acting, that this is who she is. And Jason Swartzman is the perfect sissy, silly royalty that you kind of love to hate. I really enjoyed watching this movie!"
3,The music GREATLY detracts!,"I just watched Marie Antionette.... Have to say it was a pretty big disappointment.... I went in really wanting to enjoy this movie! The costumes and sets were sumptuous and beautiful to look at and Kirsten Dunst, with the meager 'nothing' script she was given to work with, did a brilliant job.... However, the distracting 'modern' music was just horrid and detracted from the movie in a BIG way.... Also, I don't know that I've ever watched a movie with such a 'non-existant' script? Kirsten Dunst did such a good job with the small amount she was given that it gave me a reinforced appriciation for her acting skills. As a whole though, very disappointing, 'cause they could've done so much with it, given the beautiful scenery and costumes and main actress... So, there is my 2cents on the movie... OH.... Another plus of the DVD was that it had a preview for SpiderMan3! Might've been one of the parts of the DVD, full stop... hahahaha!"
2,Really??,"I was expecting something totally different.It wasn't just Kirsten Dunst performance, but the screenplay and directing that gave me my disappointment."
4,"Fun, cute, entertaining","interesting take on the historical life of marie antoinette, entertaining and fun, love this one, i recommend it for sure"
2,"What an irritating, irrelevant film! Off with its head!","Nothing happens. There is no dramatic tension. There is no drama, period. Some of the music -- modern-day rock -- used for the soundtrack is exremely irritating. I almost turned off the movie after the opening credits. Too bad I didn't and wasted two hours. This film should have been guillotined before it was made!"
2,Really just a piss-poor movie,"While ""Lost In Translation"" had at least Bill Murray to give an ironic weight to Sofia Coppola's blank stares at Japanese culture, ""Marie Antoinette"" has no such ballast to prevent it from being a pretty but hollow confection. Granted, the set design is period-pitch perfect, but having a cast go through the royal motions while occasionally dancing to new wave is no substitute for a decent script or narrative interest. Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" was a similarly slow, pretty picture set in the 18th century, but there you sensed a real gravity to the characters, of the weight of custom shaping their lives; Kirsten and her empty gang yawn us to the exits well before that guillotine comes a callin'. Just pray Papa Coppola stops bankrolling his daughter's fiascos so that we might save a few hours of our moviegoing lives."
5,DVD MARIA ANNTOINETE,"I AM VERY DESAPOINTED, BECAUSE I ALREADY BY THIS DVD 1000 TIMES, AND THE LAST TIME I WHANT THE SOUND TRACK, SOUND TRACK, SAUND TRACK, AND U SEND ME AGAIN THE MOVIE, I DONT HAVE TIME FOR THIS...RODICULOS"
4,Ahhh - Loved all the beautiful colours!!!,"Well I think that Sofia Coppola is fantastic, however I wasn't to fascinated by the story line in this one. But absolutely loved all the fashion, colours, scenery and decadence. This made it a winner with me. Kirsten Dunst was very enchanting too, silly little King Louis - don't know want was going through his head!"
1,POINTLESS !,"This movie was a waste! Why is it that everyone had a foreign accent except the main character - who sounded like she was from the midwest.Maybe it would have been asking too much for Kirsten Dunst actually ""act"".Sofia coppola sure got over with nepotism on this one. After watching this movie I had run to my history books. What a waste!"
2,waste of time,"If you are a Kirsten Dunst fan, she can be the only reason for you to watch this film. Cause there is nothing else.. sure there are great fancy costumes and scenery; but you can simply look at the photos for that. The music was horrible at the times. Even the sensational quote of the Queen was 'lost in translation.' The director's this film disappointed me. Although, I have to say, the film is quite funny and entertaining."
2,In the eye of the beholder,"I love time pieces...movies that are based on true events brought back to life in a brilliant film. Movies such as The Pianist, Count of Monte Cristo, and so many more. But this movie, was not only full of a bad soundtrack of just overall should have never been made. Based in france very few of the actors had french accents and Kirsten Dunst was more into the costumes than her acting abilities.Overall it wasn't what you would think it is based on the cover."
1,Her money could be used by real filmmakers,"A few years ago, S. Coppola woke up and said: ""I want to make a movie! I have no idea about it, but I will shoot it in Tokyo to make sure it's different! Money is not a problem! Just have to ask dad! It will be awesome and look artsy!""A few years later, she woke up again and said: ""I want to make another movie! I have no idea about it but what the hell! It will be a historical movie! Lots of costumes, wigs, French castles, velvet curtains, chandeliers, white powder in the face! Money is not a problem! It will be awesome!""If you want to see a serious movie about this time period, go for the real thing, pick a French movie."
1,Lacking substance,"The only redeming qualities in this movie were the costumes and the sets. The film is beautiful to look at but you can only look at beautiful pictures for so long. It was painfully dull, the only reason I didn't walk out on this movie is because I went to see it with a friend and she kept hoping it would get better...it didn't. All three of us were extremly dissapointed in the movie. Sophia never let her audience get to know or care about Marie and because of that lack of conection her death scene wasn't that moving. The affair she had was hinted at by her looking out the window and staring romantically at a guy on a horse. This movie had so much potential to be great but Sophia destroyed it by focusing on the clothes and not on the charecters. There was no substance or depth to any of her charecters. They were one demensional, uninteresting and flat. Shame on you Sophia."
2,Not so pretty in pink...,"I'd recommend this movie to a group of 12 year old girls who want nothing more than a story about a pretty royal queen.Not only is this movie fairly boring, but it's also slightly inaccurate, considering the fact that they never mentioned a thing about how Marie Antoinette was put under a guillotine to be decapitated for the misery she put her country through. This movie also did not show Marie Antoinette's partying at its worst, she committed much worse acts than just simply staying out at masquerade parties until 3am.Like I said, this movie is nice for pre-teen and teenage girls who just want a nice bubblegum-style movie to watch."
2,Bettter with the sound off,"I almost turned this off after five minutes but forced myself to see it to the end. I couldn't stand the American accents and the odd music score. I could only remember Dunst as Spiderman's girlfriend and Schwartzman as Claire Dane's boyfriend in Shopgirl. Granted, the scenes from Versailles were beautiful as was the costuming in this heavily icing coated movie. If the sound were muted, it may have been more enjoyable. Watching 'Louis' stiffly riding his horse in several scenes added to the pain."
3,rent it.,"it's worth a look to see versailles, bright period costuming, plus artistic & detailed (but sometimes repetitive) camera angles... but don't buy it. like other reviewers noted, it lacks historical accuracy and without that tragic end, the story is worthless. the entire world's facination with marie antionette began with, and was magnified by her death. if she doesn't die... why on earth am I watching this?!the soundtrack this movie is set to ranges from tolerable to (at one point) absolutly awful. bluntly, it's elevator music... and they've got the queen dancing to it.so don't buy it, rent it. unless you've found it for sale in the bargain bin..."
2,What was it?,"As a biography, it is lacking. As a general movie, there is not much there. OK to watch if you have nothing better to do."
2,Certainly not Kirsten Dunst's fault...,"Visually stunning but uneven in pace, temperament and story, I found myself cleaning up the kitchen during the slow spots and this was the first time I was seeing the film. I cannot blame Kirsten Dunst for this -she certainly acted her part well. The costumes, sets, and her acting are the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one.I should also mention that as a rule I LOATHE period films that utilize rock/pop/current music in the film. What made it even worse in this case is that it bounced back and forth between Rock that felt very out of synch and Classical that actually added to the depth of the film. The result was audio whiplash.I was very disappointed as I expected the film would be one to add to my library. Not."
3,Good In Part,"The portrayal of the opulence and stultifying protocol are excellent. We people are built to handle the challenges of life, in fact their absence leads to boredom. The king had his hunts, but Marie only had protocol, church, garden strolls, and parties. I was forced to consider just what her environment would do to the average person, how would it warp one's character? From this perspective I thought it was excellent. The attempt to interplay least-common-denominator rock music with 18th century French opulence I found quite annoying (and the music was of poor melodic quality). Subtract the music and this movie would have been quite decent."
1,"I too, wanted to chop off my own head...","I went into this movie thinking I would come out with an understanding of Marie Antoinette's life, from her perspective. I didn't. I knew she was beheaded but never really knew why, and I still don't. This movie drags on for 2 hours, with very little dialog and awful music. The parts of her life that may actually have been interesting were only briefly touched upon, if at all. I thanked god when the credits rolled."
3,"Just above ""OK"" - for a chick flick!","I was looking foward to this for years and when I finally got around to seeing it I was only pleasently surprised that it didn't suck 100% like nearly every chick flick ever made. This one had almost no bite to it but it still had more than most. As usuall with so many chick flicks there's lots fancy clothes and sex and fields of flowers on a mid-summers day. You know - the standard stuff from most movies directed by women. I don't understand why women ,and women directors find that so appealing. I can go on but I think you get where im going with this.As for what I did like I did like Mrs. Dunsts' performance. She kind of reminds me of Natalie Portman before ""V For Vendetta""! Lots of potential but she keeps picking rolls that are somewhat underdone. Spider-man wont get her an Oscar but all it takes is that one special break-out movie. Oh well. A girls got to keep working right?"
2,Disappointing,I was really enjoying this movie up until the point where they started playing music from Siouxsie and Banshees and New Order along with other songs from the 1980's. At this point the movie lost all credibility. I'm sure there's some flaky deep artsy fartsy reason for this but it was a turn off. However the costumes and cinematography were beautiful. Still disappointed though.
2,For lovers of 18th century fashion only,"This movie is basically a 2 hour fashion parade of 18th century French style. The photography is good, but the story is too superficial to hold interest."
3,A bit confused ...,"My husband and I happened to watch this movie by chance and both of us got quite into it ... which is always a good sign. The main plot line that kept us hooked was how Marie Antoinette's husband just won't have sex with her!! My husband would normally dismiss these types of movies as chick flicks, but this plot line kept him intrigued!I'm not a Kirsten Dunst fan, so she wasn't a big drawcard for me. The costumes and architecture were fabulous and I loved the way they created an air of indulgence and opulence in the palace ... this was somewhat spoiled by random modern background music at odd points in the story.So not a bad movie ... an Okay way to spend a Sunday afternoon."
3,"Visually delicious, but empty calories","Forget the historical inaccuracies, rock music, and anachronisms. This movie was a visual feast! It's filled to the hilt with gorgeous costumes, cinematography, and top class art direction. It plays more like a music video, with its minimal dialogue and plot development. This Marie Antoinette is portrayed as a naive, teen queen, isolated from the real world, and trapped in a court of excesses. Kirsten Dunst (along with supporting cast) truly delivers. It's too bad there wasn't more meat to this movie. The lack of a real story made the last half hour drag a bit as you can only stomach just so much eye-candy before getting sick of it."
4,Interesting Movie,"This movie had AMAZING clothes and set design and the fact that a lot of it was filmed at Versailles was incredible! If you like a movie with lots of action and dialogue, this is not the movie for you. It has little dialogue, but the somes of the scenes are really dramatic and they speak for themselves. All in All it was a great movie!"
2,Disappointment,"This movie is a pure disappointment for me, maybe I've set a high expectation for Sofia Coppola after Lost in Translation. The movie's pace is very slow and the ending will leave you with a blank, and say ""That's it?"""
2,All Style No Substance,"Very colorful scenes that are esay on the eyes, but this movie had little if any substance. They could have brought the point across of how boring and shallow her life was without making the movie boring and shallow itself. At one point I was hoping someone would have dragged me to the guillotine and away from this movie."
2,Disappointing and yet.....,The movie was beautifully photographed and the sets and costumes were certainly spectacular but it dragged on painfully and turned a very compelling and exciting subject matter into one big yawn.It did however make me want to know more about Marie Antoinette and about that time period and I give it credit for enticing me to buy the excellent biography that it was based on.The soundtrack was also excellent although initially it seems like heresy to use 80s music as a backdrop to a period piece.I give Sophia Coppola an E for effort and a vote of thanks for bringing attention to the book and its subject.
1,Unbearable.,"This is a film posing as an art film posing as an art film. Yes, it is twice removed as a piece of imitation garbage, missing the mark so terribly, I'm shocked this script was ever greenlit. There is absolutely zero discernable arc for any of the characters, least of all Marie Antoinette herself. There are so many long, boring shots (yes, even the cinematography here is uninspired) of Kirsten Dunst either A) lying down B) walking in a straight line C) standing still. Wouldn't you know, the ending puts all three together in a glorious display of inertia. Even the attempt to throw modern music into the mix feels like it was a post-production afterthought, something Coppola thought would be, like, cool. Or something.Big disappointment after Lost in Translation. This one really hurt."
3,The movie would be better if the right type of music!,"I give the movie 5 stars it was well done, with lots of original locations but the music deserves -2 stars, too bad can show negative stars in the review! The producers should have used period music, and there are plenty available from composers of the time!"
2,Pointless story of a pampered air-head,"Nicely acted, nicely photographed. The use of modern rock music with a period costume drama just doesn't work. Why make this movie? The characters are shallow and boring. Perhaps this is supposed to convince us that the French revolution was justified. But we were cheated out of seeing the execution. We just get endless scenes of self-indulgent aristocrats munching on bon bons. We get the sense that the director is somehow curiously sympathetic to Marie Antoinette, but we can't figure out why."
1,Let's Eat Cake Instead of Watching this Movie,"Set to a completely discordant soundtrack of post-punk, Sofia Coppola's translation of Antonia Frasier's biography of Marie Antoinette to the big screen falls flat on all counts but one. The film is unquestionably beautiful. The costumes, sets, pastries, Manolo Blahnik shoes, Louis XIV furniture, etc were fascinating to watch, but that was really all that the movie had going for it. The plot was virtually nonexistent, and the characters were never fully (or even partially, really) developed. By the end of the film, I was left really wanting to throw an 18th century France theme party, but that's about it."
1,let us eat cake,"This movie is a not-so-subtle reflection of Coppola's own adolescence. Sophia, who obviously feels quite sorry for herself, presents an endless montage of painfully vapid images meant to show the clock-punching public how truly horrible it is to grow up in a household dripping with luxury and privilege. It begs the slovenly masses to give thanks for their work-a-day lives, which Coppola assumes are devoid of mind-numbing protocol, fancy desserts, 80's music and limp lovers. ""Its not so great to be wealthy!"" is the film's war cry, along with the whiny plea, ""There's no need to envy the rich, so please don't storm the gates and chop off our crowned, vastly superior, heads!"""
1,BAD!!!,"This movie is terrible. It's probably the worst movie ever made. Oh well, another piece of garabage for the MTV generation. We will all be laughing about this flick 10 years from now."
1,Garbage.,This was a first for me. 1/2 way through this miserble POS I took the DVD out of my computer and tossed it into the garbage. And I'm not kidding.
2,"Valley Girl/Eurotrash ""Marie Antoinette""","Save your money and buy the original b&w; version starring Norma Shearer. The photography is vastly superior and the costumes, by Adrian are unmatched.The screenplay for this new version is a disaster and I believe Ms. Coppola (sp?) was off her medication or on a bad acid trip when she directed this and wrote the screenplay. Kirsten Dunst is miscast - a European actress would probably have been better. The contemporary music dates this movie and ruins the spirit. It's a shame that with access to Versailles and a great costume designer that the opportunity to film Marie Antoinette in color was wasted ...If you want to see a great French period piece in color, buy ""Dangerous Liaisons""."
2,"Its a Dang Pretty Movie, I'll give it that","But it lacks a bit of story and makes little sense. This movie could've been an hour or so shorter for all the decadent fluff they add to this movie. And yes, I get that is the point, that they don't like her because they were so extravagent, but they don't really articulate that or show it - its just two hours of her living like a Versaillan rock star and then them leaving France. The end. In addition, most of the characters talk like American college kids while some others have english accents or austrian accents (No french though. Not one. Also Rip Torn plays king Louis. Wha?)On the good side, the palace is amazing, the costumes immaculate, and the details gorgeous. It starts off well too as the young Austrian gets used to the insane amount of pomp and circumstance that she comes into living in Versailles. The scenery is epic. I just wish they had constructed a more compelling story around it."
3,Modern interpretation,"A good modern biographical interpretation of MA. Excellent use of hip modern songs & music to relate today's people to what could have been like had we lived in MA's time. The fun parties, the excitement of an innocent woman in love who happened to be princess/queen.Beautiful set & costume design. Honest & some what authentic but with a touch of humor This movie focuses on the happier, positive time rather than the dark ending of MA's reign.I was surprised it was not yet released on BR while other crappy movies ( Lawless ) have.The soundtrack has many good & haunting songs."
2,Slow and Boring,"I rented this movie to get some background for a costume that I'll be wearing this year. Generally I LOVE to read novels from this period, but this movie was simply long, slow and boring. Not quite what I was expecting by any means."
2,Did Sophia Coppola read the entire book?,"The movie is based upon Antonia Fraser's ""Marie Antoinette, A Journey"", yet Coppola left so much of it out of the movie that I wonder whether she just opened random pages & picked out ideas for the script at random. Several key events in Marie Antoinette's life are missing:1. The Diamond Necklace Affair2. The death of Louis Joseph3. The birth of Louis Charles4. The failed flight of the royal family from Paris w/ the assistance of Count Ferson5. The family's subsequent imprisonment in the Tuileries6. The assassinations of both the King & QueenWhat we are left w/ is a very pretty, though disjointed film. If you want to learn about Marie Antoinette, I suggest that you skip this film & just read Antonia Fraser's book."
1,Uhhhh .... NO!,"I got free tickets to see this movie. And I was SOOO happy I didn't spend money. Although the costumes, the furniture and scenery were beautiful (as said in one of the previous reviews), the movie did not capture my attention. My aunt, who went went with me, fell asleep! I started to get a little sleepy-eyed myself.The storyline of the lives of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI stuck to some historical facts. I would have preferred, however, to have heard music from that particular era, not music from our modern times. And, I didn't know why they put Converse sneakers in the movie! A few times, I thought I heard Kirstin Dunst use an English accent. Even though the director and producer were trying to make it more appealing to a younger generation, it was boring and not thrilling, until the end!Sorry, it didn't do anything for me."
1,Unforgivable,"Sofia, honey, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??? It is such a privilege for a filmmaker to have both the financial resources and the access to a World Heritage site like Versailles...to then come up with THIS? Vapid. Frivolous. A spectacularly self-indulgent production that was nothing more than a surreal, girly fantasy.There was one true thing about this film: Inherited privilege comes to no good. It is true with royal families, and it is true, also, with Hollywood."
4,Let them have Marie Antoinette,"The movie was visually stunning. The scenery, the costumes, the colors, everything just ""popped""!I didn't really care for the modern music as the soundtrack (hence, the 4 stars) but I see why it was chosen. It gives us the sense that Marie Antoinette was just like us, not some name in a textbook. She was young and wild and wanted the freedom to do so, regardless if she was the Queen of France or not.I LOVED Kirsten Dunst in this role. You can really see how Marie Antoinette grows throughout the film. From a young girl, to a mother, to her husband's equal. The film is done from her perspective, so there's no fighting or blood and gore. And from what I have read, it was a pretty accurate portrayal of her too.There are mixed reviews on this movie, and if you are even the slightest bit interested, it's worth at least renting."
5,interesting view on her life,"i enjoyed this movie very much on the first viewing. It gets better every time i watch it.The movie is based on the book by Antonia Fraser. I attempted to read the book, but gave up.The movie opens in Austria, where Marie is heading off to be married, at the age of fourteen, to the Dauphin of France. Upon her arrival at Versailles, she is married, and the couple are put to bed, where, it is hoped, the marriage is consummated.Nothing happens. And nothing will happen for some time. In the meantime, we get to see her grow from a young girl, to a woman, mother and queen. We see the extravanges that people so hated her for, and her circle of friends( some questionable, some not) as well as her alleged lover Axel von Fersen.The costumes are wonderful, and the setting is excellent. You really believe you are watching her life at Versailles. I understand the filmeers were granted access to Versailles for shooting.A very excellent movie."
3,I want candy,"The always-impressive Kirsten Dunst doesn't have much to do in this movie except look gorgeous. She plays the young Marie Antoinette who as a teenager is married to King Louis' son (Jason Schwartzman) and must leave everything familiar behind including her beloved dog. Once there, she adjusts slowly to the hotbed of gossip and intrigue. Her primary problem is the necessity of producing an heir, something the entire court seems to be holding their breath for. Most of the effort clearly went into the set design and costumes, not character development. There is a lot of partying by the characters, and montages set to rock. As Marie and her friends continue to live a lavish lifestyle, the rest of the country experiences poverty. What ultimately happens to the queen is omitted entirely. Instead, we get scene after candy-colored scene of the lifestyles of the rich and famous. The movie is all style with little substance."
1,Review by Edward G. Nilges right on the mark,"There is nothing that I can add to the review by: Edward G. Nilges ""Father of two good kids"".Thank you Edward, you're right on the mark."
1,Worst historical film,I have been wanting to see this movie for the last several years. Last night I finally watched it and was so disappointed that I was angry for the few hours after. This is by far the worst historical movie I have ever seen. The music in the movie was from modern time and the entire story does not focus on the most important part of her life.
4,Marie Antoinette,"This movie tells the life of Marie Antoinette after her betrothal to Louis XVI. From shoes to scandals, this movie outlines Marie Antoinette's nature, and her dedication to a life of fabulousness and outrageousness. We hear her utter those immortal words that caused such an outrage amongst the peasants of France, but we soon learn that it was a lie, as was much of her life. The visuals and auditory elements, which evoke a powerful image of 18th-century Versailles, are the movie's forte. The end of the movie is a bit abrupt, the last image shows the royal family heading to Paris to be imprisoned in the building of the Conciergerie. There is no mention of the guillotine anywhere, which again can seem surprising, but which shows that Coppola deliberately tried to eschew stereotypes and do something different. I was wonderfully surprised by this unusual movie."
4,PEOPLE ARE MISSING THE POINT!,"I see a lot of reviews on here saying this is a bad historical film. To clarify... the director has stated repeatedly that she didn't want to make a historical bio-pic. She wanted to make a film about Marie Antoinette to show her youth and vibrance that teenagers could relate to. The 80's music and non-use of French are both clear indicators that this isn't a movie for viewers who want a fact-by-fact retelling of Marie's life.It disappoints me that this film is so underrated, despite it's vibrant, fun, and optimistic take on one of the world's greatest and most controversial historical figures."
2,Huge disappointment,"My wife likes costume flicks so I took a chance on this exacrable piece of trash. The costumes are there (mostly in the shoes department, so unless you have a foot [...], you may be disappointed). But the movie was very poorly executed. The modern music was at best a distraction, but more often than not, ruined the scene. The acting was also disappointing (except for Rip Torn). The French Revolution, one of the bloodiest epochs in human history, takes place off camera -- a few scenes of the poverty being endured by the French peasants would have been a great contrast with the indulgence of the French Court. The presence of Sofia Coppola as director should have been a clue, since everything she has touched has been terrible -- the woman should not be allowed within 500 feet of a movie camera. Rent this before you consider buying it. I wish I had!"
2,Nice to look at....that's about it,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. So a friend and I watched it together both just really excited to see it....what a total disappointment. It is by far one of the most beautiful movies I've ever had the pleasure of looking at but as far as the story is concerned....there really wasn't one. By the time the end of the movie decided to role around I realized I was done with it an hour ago and just kind of waiting for it to be over. I don't recommend it but if you're looking for something pretty that'll take up 2 hours, go for it."
3,"Worth watching, but lacking","As a lover of this type of fare, I found Sophia Copolla's Marie Antoinette lacking in depth and its ability to keep the viewer's interest in the story or the characters. The costume and art work is probably the best I have seen in my many years of period piece watching. The cinematography is also skillfully done featuring sweeping vistas of grandeur. The actors did a fine job with the thin story line. So, while I will watch it again to ensure I didn't miss anything and for one more glimpse at the sumptuous settings, costumes, etc, I have a hard time giving the movie overal above a 3."
4,dug this movie,"Kristen Dunst is pretty foxy too! interesting soundtrack for a movie set in the 1700's (a lot of early eighties retro music) cool sets. the only ""scratch my head"" moment is the end. That's all i'm gonna say..."
2,Eye candy ruined by the soundtrack,"The historicity is dubious; the only reason to watch this film is for the visuals, the mise en scène, the lumninous Kirsten Dunst in the title role, the gorgeous costumes by Milena Canonero, and Véronique Melery's set design.Unfortunately, all that beauty is undermined by the soundtrack -- a schizophrenic hodgepodge of period-appropriate opera and minuets, and fingernails-on-a-blackboard 21st century rock and roll.I suggest watching it with the sound off and the subtitles on."
1,Beautiful but boring,"I was expecting the rock music but there is absolutely, positively no story here. Nothing, nada, zilch.The interiors look great, the clothes look divine, and the food looks luscious but that's all there is to this movie.I could have enjoyed about 30 minutes of this eyecandy if they had just added the music from the time period - Mozart, Haydn go better with these visuals. The visuals were light and frothy but the soundtrack was aggressively modern, heavy and racing - too aggressive for this light fairytale painting. If you're going to put rock music in a historical drama, you need to put a story with it.Even as an airheaded delight for the senses, it failed."
3,"Help ... get rid of the ""music""","Is there any way to get the ""modern music"" off the soundtrack? It's horrible. Why go to all the trouble of making an otherwise ""authentic"" version of the story and ruin it with such miserable excuses for a musical score. How can Ms. Coppola be that stupid? I loved ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and loved the score, even though it was wrong: it was Vivaldi. The French favorite Gluck would have been awful in that film. The little of Gluck was enough in Marie Antoinette. There had to be a way just to have evocative music written by a modern movie composer and there are a lot of people who could have contributed to the film with good music.Also, Jason Schwartzman was a weak choice. There are just too many Coppola relatives who are not automatically suitable for a Coppola film."
2,Complete waste of everybody's time,"This movie was a huge disappointment; If wanted to see beautiful shots of Versailles for 2 and half hours I would look pictures up on the internet.The only redeeming aspect of was the costumes and scenery, everything else was horrible. Kirsten Dunst was not very well suited at all for this character. Her performance came off as very artificial, not realistic at all. Characters spoke in modern American English with a limited vocabulary (not even a fake French accent), the music was distracting and felt very out of place in nearly every scene, and because of the lack of character, I didn't care what happened to anyone. And it feels like it's about four hours long. The film is utterly useless to anyone who wishes to learn anything about Marie Antoinette's life.Apparently, Sofia didn't inherit the talent gene from Daddy."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"The fact that she speaks english and giggles over a picture in a locket seemed to promise an endearingly silly revisionist angle, like A Knight's Tale or something, but that quickly fell to the wayside with the most distinct feature becoming the lack of dialogue, and what little dialogue there is hardly seems laboured over, lacking equally in historical insight and creativity. Presumably a lot of work went into set and costume design but nothing about it strikes me as anything beyond standard issue for a period piece. There don't even seem to be any pretentions to criticize the film for. It seems to have no ambitions at all. You could call it a minimalist mood piece, but it's too traditional in look and feel to set any distinct mood."
2,beautiful but shallow,"Scoppola says in the feature interview that she wanted to make an impressionist film, of her very own impression of that period rather than to tell history, and that pretty much sums it up. Also I think that her impression of that century is not very original, rock and barock is not exactly a novelty. Most of the story is based on wether the newly wed couple (Marie-Antoinette and Louis XVI) will sleep together or not.But the film is incredibly aesthetic and very entertaining.Kirsten Dunst is perfect for her part. And I like the fact that Scoppola makes you feel sympathy for one of the history`s most mocked persons."
3,Lush and Beautiful,"I did not find this movie as powerful as ""Lost In Translation."" That being said, I still love it, and the price of the DVD is more than offset by the fact that I can watch the ""Cake and Shoes"" scene set to ""I Want Candy"" any time I please, and particularly when I'm feeling blue. The music is great, the visuals are even better."
3,Even the Desserts Looked a Little Worn Out...,"There's nothing new to say about these self-indulgent French Royals. The facts were straight-forwardly presented, but I think the director was more interested in how the film looked, rather than what it sounded like. Speaking about sound... What was with the brief interludes of rock music? So out of place, their intrusion into the film was distracting and (to me) quite confusing.There was more time dedicated to food and romping in the garden surrounding Marie Antoinette's Petite Trion than to the entertaining history behind the story. If you didn't know the history, at the end of the film, you might even think that the Royal Family were off for a weekend on the French Riviera."
2,Let Them Eat Dialogue,"Sofia Coppola's visually sumptuous ""Marie Antoinette"" substitutes pesky politics and character development for a souffle of Vogue Euro Fashion, music vid clips, and falls flat on its purdy, bejeweled, highly bewigged head.Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of Marie is like a petulant teen looking to get her prom on, whilst Jason Schwartzman (as her betrothed Louis XVI) spends the entire film lacking bam bam in the boudoir...but really, who could blame him? How would you like it if your in-laws and aquaintances had first row seats whilst you and the missus got mad busy yo in the royal honeymoon sack? Frankly, Marie and Louis shoulda charged admission.In summary, ""Marie Antoinette"" plays out like an expensive candygram and even fails to give the audience what the angry mob of the 18th century got:Friends, Romans, countrymen, where is a guillotine when you need one?"
3,Marie Antoinette movie,"I bought this for my teen niece. The girlie, material world was something I felt she'd relate to and find enjoyable. It's the 2nd time I watch it and in a shopping montage I caught a pair of blue keds in Antoinette's closet: clever. I am a fan of Coppola's movies and this was a solid interpretation of the life of a teenager; we tend to forget most of these folks were very young when they had to assume power. If you are looking for some kind of Andrew Davies BBC Classics go elsewhere. This is dreamy and drippy and full of lush sets, costumes, pastels, and laid back acting. The mix of accents from New York, British, to American was another playful element. Again, leave your expectations out and approach this for its content not historical chops (though, it is as accurate as any biopic can be)"
3,3 stars for costumes and sets,I cannot imagine what thinking went behind starring Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette and Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI. I can almost forgive the music because the acting was so laughable. I'm glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't pay to see it in a theater or through Netflix.Three star rating is for the costumes and set designs.
4,pleasing for the mtv 1980's set,"i agree with most of the positive and negative views on this film. i couldn't take my eyes off of it. i instantly related to the urges of youthful extravagance and impertinence, especially with adam ant and bow wow wow in the background.this movie is not formulaic. it is not mainstream. it is interesting, thoughtful, somewhat provoking and, not in the least, beautifully filmed.ultimately, it may be indulgent. however, i love that sort of creativity.i found many scenes that would make great portraits. gorgeous. specific. not for your average film-go-er. they won't get it.watch it with an open mind and be patient as if you were studying a degas or a monet. beauty is in the eye of sophia...........i mean, the eye of the beholder. ;)"
1,Pure apple sauce,"I felt it prudent not to waste more than 12 minutes of my life on this film. I'd rather stand in line at the post office...at least there's some point. Drawn out scenes to show off the costumes and set designs which were average at best, were not only poorly shot but also made preposterous by the addition of a music score made up of an irrelevant mix of silly pop rock instrumentals with cheesy electronic drum beats and guitars.Kirsten is meeting the French court and saying ""Hello, and thank you"" in a midwestern accent. After recovering from the shock of this slop and wiping the disbelief that something could be this dreadful from my eyes, I dashed forth to the DVD player for removal and return. Trust me.... it stinks."
1,Wow,I was expecting a lot more out of this. There is so much they could have done with Marie Antoinette and yet they do so little. So much of the movie is instrumental montages of nothing. It was dull and boring. I almost fell asleep multiple times. Waste of $3. They barely even included anything from the revolution. It was all court gossip and court plays with court food and court ceremonies. There are two scenes where Louis is discussing with advisors about America but no other politics. This whole time period has so much to offer but Hollywood killed it and didn't even provide an entertaining replacement.
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money. The costumes are beautiful,modern music set in the 1700's is just horrid. I wish I could have my money back"
5,Great product! Great movie!,I love this product! The movie was very interesting and the condition of the DVD disk was excellent! Neither the case nor the disk was damaged or broken in any way.
3,Musical Score,"The Musical Score detracts so very much from this film. One thing that comes to mind is that the musical score does, in fact, either add or detract to this movie! I feel that, while it is a movie for teen girls, it could have been more elevated by a more fitting musical score!"
1,What the Heck Was That?,"This movie was so bad on so many levels. First off it is a lousy adaptation of Marie Antoinette's story. Kirsten Dunst isn't anymore believable as Marie than Flavor Flav would be, please. She does not have the range or ability to pull off this type of role.I couldn't even take this movie seriously. It was like Marie Antoinette for the MTV crowd. It was pathetic. The film accomplished nothing. All we see is Dunst in beautiful costumes, eating and whining about not getting it on with her husband.I kept watching hoping it would get better and it never did. And what was with the modern soundtrack for a period film?Awful, just awful. I thought The Other Boleyn Girl was bad but that's a masterpiece compared to this crap.The only thing good about this film were the costumes and the scenery. Save your time, your money and your sanity and go watch something else."
3,A Piece of Cake,"Sophia Ford Coppola makes a strong case for the parallels of Versailles and high school in Marie Antoinette. A girlish giddiness surrounds the shoes, dresses, snobbery, and gossip in French court life. (Is that Molly Shannon in the background doing her ""cheerleader"" routine from SNL?) The film is sumptuous, tasty, and gorgeous, but I felt robbed of dialogue.It's a feast for the eyes, and helps you understand how a sweet girl can become so self absorbed she can't see what's coming."
2,Barely talented Sofia Copola makes another hollow movie - because she can,"There are a lot of brilliant writers and artists in this world who will never have the opportunities that Ms. Copola has had. So I think with the advantage of so much inheritied privilage she deserves all the criticism she gets for producing this ultimately pointless movie. Here she has been given an unbelievable opportunity, to film the whole movie in the palace of Versailles and to spend millions on set pieces, costumes and lavish confections -- and ultimately that's about ALL she does with it. This movie offers no substance or new insight whatsoever to this amazing chapter in history. As a filmmaker Sophia Copola has proven she has nothing of much importance to say, and no special gift of insight into the human psyche. I gave this DVD two stars rather than one because the technical crew on this film (such as the set designers, costumers and cinematograher) did a good job."
1,Horrible!!!!,I was shocked and disappointed with this film. I detest it and recommend that you avoid it. The actors are horrible. Direction is lacking and even absent. Plot is nowhere to be found and the historical facts are disregarded. HORRIBLE!!!!
3,Strange,"I am a fan of Sophia Coppola and Kirsten Dunst. This was not their best work. The movie started off great, offering a glimpse into the shaltered life of a child bride, and the awkwardness of arranged royal marriages. The production value is incredible, with elaborate sets and costumes. But after the birth of the first child, the movie runs out of steam, and by the end, the moviemakers don't even bother about aging the characters. It seems that the exhaustive attantion to detail in the beginning of the film leaves no room for that or even historical accuracy towards the end. A bit disappointing."
2,What a shame.,I'm so sorry to say that I had to stop in the middle of this film to say that my heart is broken. I had such high hopes for this picture. I had no idea that it was wrecked by modern music. If only I change the score for baroque.
2,Strange movie,"First of all, Kirsten Dunst is speaking in a French court with an American accent which seems a bit out of place. Then, they greet each other with modern langauge like ""Hello"", ""It's OK"". I was just waiting for them to say things like ""Dude"", ""Cool"" or ""Sweet"". Thank God they didn't!"
1,Let's eat and go hunting,"Should have been the title. Little else happens. Best way to watch this dialogue and action free snoozer is to fast forward with the sound off. Watch the pretty pictures. The scenes are all so long and drawn out that fast forward should compress them to something watchable. This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Kind of like an old Charles Bronson movie without the action...no dialogue worth bothering with. Someone actually wrote this? On what, a post-it note?"
2,where is norma shearer when we need her?,"no where near as bad as the critical reception led me to believe it to be, i **almost** gave this movie a third star, but theres just too much wrong with it and not enough right with it to justify that. i actually rather enjoyed the first hour, but the last five hours just went on and on and on and on ... am i giving you a hint as to why i am not a big fan? the use of modern music in stead of the to-be-expected period score was a cute metaphor the first time around but it soon grows tired, as does the cloying performance of kirsten dunst in the title role, who seems as unable to grow as an actress as little claudia was in size in that stupid vampire movie. director sofia coppola showed great promise in ""lost in translation"" a few years back; whether she fulfills that or just winds up a dilettante only time will tell ..."
3,Technicolor Costuming & Set Design,"I loved the costuming, make-up, set design, & cinematography as a whole as it was all very well done throughout the entire movie.The acting was so-so.... The rock music sucked entirely as it didn't go at all with this period piece.The storyline was understated throughout this movie only touching lightly on various important themes/topics involving Marie Antoinette and her life, while vaguely touching upon her role and placement in France as Queen.The only reason I gave this movie the high marks, is due to the positive features I mentioned at the start of this review. Otherwise this movie version about the life of Marie Antoinette sucked."
4,This Film Was Genuis,"Yes, the critics hated it. But didn't they also tell us Elf was a funny family classic?This film was done perfectly well in my opinion. It wasn't supposed to be a strict interpretation. This was not aired on BBC (as much as I love BBC). This was a creative approach to history.I mean look at the good. 1) Excellent casting. 2)Gorgeous costumes. 3) Upbeat, classic yet modern music that kept the movies light tone and let's not forget... 4)It showed the luxury that the court all lived in wonderfully. You saw the food, the shopping, the lavish parties, the way they brushed off other cares. You watched her rise and fall. You could feel the court hate/love/hate her.Overall, it was well done."
2,Interesting by lacking depth,"I picked up Lisa Goldstein's _Walking the Labyrinth_ unsure of what to expect. But I was both surprised and disappointed. The story is certainly original with some delightful twists in the plot, but much of the story is lacking in depth and style. Many of the explanations concerning the ""magick"" surrounding the characters were far too superficial or even at times nonexistent. The ending was just too simple for what was at times a complex plot. Furthermore, I was completely indifferent toward the protagonist. Goldstein gives the reader very little to like about her. In short, I couldn't recommend this book."
1,A failure in almost every way,"This short book fails in almost every way imaginable. The characters are shallow and two-dimensional, the story is disjointed and filled with hard to believe coincidence, the ""mystery"" elements of the book are alternately predictable then completely out of left field, the prose is flat,uninspired and so simplistic that I wonder if the book was intended as a young adult novel, and the long stretches of the book that are written as journal entries from the late 19th century are written in exactly the same tone and diction as the rest of the novel.Perhaps it suffers from the fact that the modern fantasy authors I've been reading are so good in comparison - Tim Powers, Neil Gaiman, James Blaylock, Charles de Lint, W.K. Jeter - but this novel left me with nothing positive to say at all. And I'm the sort of reader that falls in love with almost every book to come across my desk."
1,"does not recognize cartridges, prevents printing.","If one color of ink is out, it prevents all printing. Even if you have a full black cartridge. Thats ok if you want a printer that doesn't print I guess. The cartridges run out quick. The color cartridges get used up even when printing in black only. The scanner is good enough, but does not scan 35 mm negatives."
1,It would have been decent.,"Not only will it not print without Color ink. It will say your out of color ink when your not. I'm not just saying this out of frustration. If you pick up an ""empty"" cartridge, you can tell from the liquid moving around in it that it's nearly full. If that's not enough I put it on a scale, 0.1 of an oz difference. Expect to have to purchase ink every other time you want to print something.As for functionality of the scanner and everything else, well that all works fine. The scanner is not very fast but it works alright. It's prints okay pictures."
1,Self Destruct.,"Mine just self-destructed. It sucked a piece of paper into itself, made a death whine, blinked its lights furiously, and died. I can't get the paper out. Also, all the other bad things you have heard are true."
3,B&W Printing issue work-around,"Hi guys,I just got one of these printers for juts a few bucks.There are a few workarounds to the black and white printing issue. This may be helpful for those who have this printer.Here's a free program that will trick the printer into thinking it has a never-ending supply of ink:[...]There's also an extensive blog post with solutions here:[...]"
1,Feel Like Gambling? Buy This Printer.,"I just threw away an Epson CX5400, which is very similar to this CX4200. It stopped printing due to a design defect - an ink clog that occurs in a tube that is very difficult to fix. The bottom line is, it will last 1-2 years if you're lucky. Whereas an HP or Canon will last for many years longer.If you don't believe me, see the reviews for the CX5400, which has been out longer and has had time to accumulate a lot of reviews."
