5,"Excellent, very good","JFC Fuller's now-classic work deals with the issues like a soldier, not like an academic. Alexnader's battles are dissected and analysed with skill, proper emphasis is given to the problem of logistics, and the smaller battles are included, for once. Great stuff!"
5,Green for Life book review,Great book with very helpful info on health building. I have recommended it to many friends. I follow most of the suggestions and have had amazing improvements in my health including very noticeable increase in energy and I now weigh less than in years------that's very good. Thank you Ms. Boutenko for researching and sharing via your books.
5,Easy Way to Go Green!,"My vegan diet has included much raw food for many years now, and I always eat huge green salads, but juicing was so much work (especially the cleanup) that I could never really get into it. Green smoothies are the perfect solution! Until reading Victoria's book, I had never thought of adding greens to my morning smoothies. Now I add romaine lettuce, spinach, and lacinato kale, and a quart a day is easy to make and drink (tastes great too!). I feel healthier and have more energy. I wish everyone could read this book and take it to heart. It's the perfect antidote to America's processed-food dependence and so simple to include in anyone's diet, vegetarian or not.Peggy Korneggerauthor of Living with Spirit, Journey of a Flower Child"
5,green for life,"Great Book!!!!!!!! and got it on time, I'll recomended to anybody who wants to live an healthy life."
3,Sort of Let Down,I really wanted to like this book. I've seen one of Victoria's videos. I didn't care for that much.She makes so many unscientific claims that it turned me off. I figured in a book form there would be more facts and less fluff.I expected a lot from this book but was disappointed to only find about 15 pages of smoothie recipes in a 172 page book.There were pages and pages of fluff testimonials and anecdotal evidence.I'm sort of sick of hearing the comparisons between Chimpanzees and Gorillas.Chimpanzees and Gorillas are primarily vegetarian but they practice Coprophagia. No one is advocating that for humans.I think the book does have some benefit but that benefit could have been put in a 30 page pamphlet not a 172 page book.
3,"not a lot of greens, really","I was surprised that the recipes really didn't call for many greens (only a handful or so, if that). So while I think that her argument for more greens in the diet is a good one, I eat more just by lightly steaming them than I would through these smoothies (which are not delicious)."
3,Disappointed,"I admit to being a little disappointed in the book. It is more the story of a family discovery of the importance of greens than anything deep.The book includes a lot of good recipes, in its defense, but I still considered it a little shallow."
2,greatly disappointing,"I am very happy for the Boutenko family's new found health and hope that their story is true. This book felt like a lengthy high-pressure sale and was not enlightening or even that interesting. I expected to read about the health benefits of the raw or live food lifestyle, but instead found page upon page of advertisement for the VitaMix Blender. The last quarter of the book is filled with ""testimonials"" from folks happily using the VitaMix Blender. If you are looking for nutrition information or live food recipes, you will not find them here."
4,Very good green information,"I have been exploring the raw food and green world now..and this book added the needed impact.The green smoothie really tastes good, I just bought a vita-mix blender and drink it after work.I would have given 5 stars, but i think the book needs to be better organized in its content and some info is missing..like what is the best time to drink smoothie, any food-combination we need to be aware of.But the attempt to green-revolution is very good. The author has such good knowledge, needs to write more books like this with more detailed information."
1,Very disapointing book...who is this woman?,"I ordered this book from Amazon and I was very disapointed. First of all, there is no educational background listed for the author. The only thing in this book that even smells of anyone having a college education is the foreword which is written by a psychatrist!!! The rest of the book is filled with testimonials, such as asking person after person how their eliminations (color, consistency, and yes, smell) changed after drinking green smoothies, as well as a person who had a strange growth on their nose that fell-off after they drank green smoothies. There are a few pages with green smoothie recipes that are favorites of some of her family members. Save yourself some money; if you want to make green smoothies, buy a Vitamix or Blendtec blender, put in your favorite fruits, a banana, some ice, and either chard, spinach, or kale, and blend away. If you want to add some fiber, throw in some flax seed or wheat germ. Don't waste your money on this book!"
2,Not enough,would have liked to have more information about the green life and more variety of recipes. This is a good beginning book but not if you have been doing this for awhile.
4,Needs more science,"Good information but not scientifically based. She makes a lot of good points and shares personal opinion but this is only half of what I was looking for. It's was a good, quick read."
4,"How ""I"" Wants To Feel","In order for me to answer that question you must try one of her many Green Smoothic in the back of her book ""Green for Life"" its really a good book and the smoothicis even better."
5,Leena,Really changed my viewpoint on food and nutrition. I thought I knew nutrition but got a whole different education from Ms. Boutenko. I LOVE green smoothies. I've gotten several people hooked on them now. I see even Amazon has started marketing the blenders. Wow! What a revolution. This is the little book that will change your life!
4,Excellent confirmation of Green Smoothie's Health Benefits,"She's a little over-the-top for me, being 100% raw eater, but she has her (good) reasons for being so. I got a lot out of this book, including good recipes for even more delicious, hyper-nutritious green smoothies!"
4,GREEN FOR LIFE...Gotta do it!,"I am pretty much green now, this book was fantastic...family loved it too, and it has great recipes in back!Enjoy this if you are implementing juicing into your lives."
3,Green for life,"Interesting book. Ideas for heathy eating were good, but recipes are a bit limited . Had to adapt on my own."
4,Healthy Raw Eating,"I had really chalked all this up to another ""fad diet"" until I got a case of terrible indigestion and acid reflux that had my digestive system roiling for months. I went to a nutritionist and he put me on a raw foods detox program for a month. I got this book trying to find out more about the basis for this diet. The information in the book is interesting and makes sense to me in a way that I believe I will always eat under this program. I just recently had a physical and compared it to the physical I had 2 yrs ago. I have always considered myself to be healthy but was shocked to compare the results. 2 yrs ago my cholesterol was 233; it is now 165. 2 yrs ago I had 40% body fat. I am now below 30%. My friends say I look really healthy and my skin is glowing!"
3,A Basic Intro to Green Smoothies,"Easy to read, simple, probably functions best as a basic primer for green smoothies. Interestingly, the author includes a section on ""Testimonials of Roseburg Study Participants,"" and many of these testimonials paint a more subdued, realistic picture regarding the benefits of drinking green smoothies. Quite a contrast to the rest of the book, which purports that green smoothies are the answer to all of life's ills. However, the writing style is engaging and the author generously credits other sources such as Ann Wigmore."
5,"3 Year Old Eats Kale, Spinach and Parsley!","This book has truly changed my life and I purchase it for all of my pregnant friends and friends with small children. I was having a lot of difficulty getting my three year old daughter to eat green leafy vegetables. I followed some of the recipes in ""Green for Life"" and my daughter loved them, me too! I've even gotten her playgroup friends drinking them. Their moms are so grateful! I make these green smoothies every day and you only need the produce you find at the grocery store, how easy is that? I am forever appreciative of this book. It's a quick read with big, easy, life changing ideas."
5,Ann Wigmore for the Modern Age,"This book is a valuable asset to my library.Imagine... not just a way to get all of your RDA of fruits and vegetables, but in such a way that you barely even notice.The concept of simply dumping your green veggies in with your daily smoothies is ingenious. You get all of the advantages of the fiber, phytochemicals and other nutrients with none of the sometimes objectionable taste.I'm really happy I came across this book which shared this very workable solution. And not only is the book's formula great, but it was well-written and easy to follow, with great recipes.You can enjoy more energy and vitality today simply by reading this book and following its advice. In today's world of hype and exorbitant claims, it doesn't get much better that."
5,Highly practical and very clear -- recommeded,This in my view is the most important book written on raw food by Victoria Boutenko. It is the cutting edge of the raw food practice. Clear and practical. It is my #1 on my raw bookshelf and I follow it in my day to day life. Works wonders.Highly recommended!
3,"Great idea, novice writing","Incorporating leafy greens into our diet using smoothies is an excellent idea, I just wish this book was more well written. To be fair, this was written by a health enthusiast, not a professional writer or a dietician. This reads more like a blog or an E-zine article than a published book. Most of her evidence is anecdotal, but the stories are definitely inspiring, and she certainly is passionate about the topic. I was grateful for the list of smoothie recipes and tips on slowly incorporating into the diet."
1,Much better books on healthy eating are available,"As a recent convert to eating more raw vegetables I had high expectations for this book. Unfortunately it has very few recipes or usable information. Worse, much of this is book is simply wrong - a regurgitation of the vegan raw dogma that is simply incorrect. Chimps might not need animal protein - which is why that have extended stomachs - but is it accurate to then assert that humans don't need any animal protein? The author suggests that all mammals are the same. Should we adopt a dolphin or whale diet?Sorry, I really wanted to like this book. I'm in dire need of good recipes for juicing and smoothie creation. Just didn't find them here - or information that I can trust. Dubious science, pseudo-religious veganism, and conclusions based on outdated research make this book a pass. Anyone want my copy?"
5,I don't have ezcema anymore!,"This book is great! I bought it after a coworker reccommended it. It's helped me so much that my parents, grandmother, uncle make green smoothies and they pass it along to their friends. I have had ezcema (or so all my dermatologists and allergists have said) for over 9 years. I've tried multiple creams, steroid creams and other junk and it has not helped. After reading Green For Life I started making green smoothies. It's been a year and I no longer have ezcema. I'll make green smoothies about once a month ( I'm lazy about making them). If I go too long without a green smoothie i start itching again. They actually taste good and are good for a ""snack"" during the day. I haven't actually followed any of Victoria's recipes. My favorite is a few handfulls of spinach, two apples and some cinnamon and a bit of water. It tastes just like cinnamon apples. This is a good book and green smoothies are an excellent way to incorporate more fresh greens and fruits into your diet."
3,.,I brought this as a gift for someone that is very into the altenative health. ...... ..... ..... ...... ...
2,just another fad book,"this book did inspire me to eat more greens. and maybe i'll even try some green smoothies. but for the most part, this felt like just another generic, cure-all fad book about how 'x' will solve all of your problems - be it green tea, fish oil, juicing, raw diet, whatever. while all of these things can be helpful, there is no silver bullet."
2,Too many opinions not enough facts!,"If you are looking for a good recipe book for raw food, this is probably not it. Author spends way too much time story-telling than providing worth while claims backed by evidence. However, if you are a complete novice to the world of good nutrition it may be an interesting start. Overall this book contains information poor content which if pooled together might add up to an interesting essay. Flip through it at Borders before buying!!"
5,Excellent Book,"This book is a keeper! The book gave very good evidence, based on research done on chimpanzees, that we were meant to be eating more greens in our diet. I'm researching how to improve my diet and health, and this has definitely inspired me to try this myself. The smoothies are very tasty when fruit is added to greens. I've reduced my food cravings immensely. Read the book and try this yourself. You'll be surprised at how much better you feel, too."
3,Not too many good recipes,"I'm a huge fan of Victoria but I was a bit let down with this book. I haven't really found a book with a lot of good smoothie recipes and this is not it. It explains the philosophy behind them and you quickly learn as long as you have a green lettuce, any type of fruit(s) and a sweetener if need be plus any optional items such as protein or psyllium powder, its really all about experimenting. If you want the philosophy, buy the book. If not; spend you cash on ingredients and look up recipes online."
4,Transform your thinking,"Transform your thinking about greens in your diet. A review of natural chimpanzee eating. Soluble vs. insoluble fiber and their sources. Fiber in relation to toxins elimination. Wonderful wide variety of recipes at the end of the book, including Boutenko family favorites, are all tempting adventures to make easily at home. The recipes are my favorite section of the book."
3,What's up with all the hype?,"All talk and no action describes this book well. Too much talk, and not enough of the basics. The recipes are just okay. I have tried almost all of them and have only found one that is worth repeating (Igor's favorite). Even my very open-minded kids think these recipes are ""not keepers"". Disappointed."
3,Good rationale for green and raw but limited recipes,"Had been hoping for lots of green smoothie recipes, but found only a handful at the very end. The rest of the book supports the value of eating raw and green. Good, but I was already convinced!A real plus is that the recipes call for a wide array of diverse greens: spinach, dandelion, kale, mustard, cilantro, parsley, mint, lettuce and others that I can't get where I live. Most recipes result in smoothies volumes for large for ordinary blenders. A Vitamix or other large blender would be best."
3,Not for me,"Most of the book is trying to sell you on eating raw foods so I skipped most of that because I am already sold on a raw diet. I am just trying to find an easier way to get them into me. I was a bit disappointed that in her small recipe section, the main green ingredient is dandelion or some other type of wild weed. I live on 8 acres and so probably have those somewhere on my land but I am not an expert in that area and just would be nervous about picking my own, except for the dandelions but you can only get dandelions in the spring. I tried to substitute storebought greens for the wild weeds.My first drink was so awful..I strained it and then drank it...I guess the green smoothies are not for me as I cannot stomach drinking all that vegetable fiber. This is my second attempt at green smoothies so I'm giving up and going back to straight green juices."
2,Want to be healthy,I tried a few of the smoothies and found that I didn't like them very much. I'm sure they're great for many...just not for me.
3,OK....,"This book was just OK. It was written differently than I'd expected (like a novel) which made it hard for me to read.The information in this book is, of course, amazing and wonderful, but I just wish it was in a different format. Something easier to peruse and fact-find."
3,This will have you hooked on green smoothies...,"The principles Victoria discussed in her book were interesting, but I was disappointed to see that she rarely included any references to back up the claims. That's why I didn't rate this book with more stars.However....it will have you hooked on green smoothies! There's no denying that leafy green vegetables are good for you, and this is an unbelievably easy and painless way to eat them. My husband and I bought a VitaMix (also highly recommended) eight months ago and I'm still drinking green smoothies on a regular basis. I also haven't been sick since, and I swear my skin is clearer because of the smoothies. I would wholeheartedly recommend trying a green smoothie for yourself--and this book is a nice introduction."
5,Green for Life,Really informative. Great research for raw foodists or not. Well written and easy to read. You will know why and how to eat more greens forever.
4,Informative book with plenty of interesting information about healthy living.,"This book was not entirely what I expected to read when I ordered it from Amazon; however, I still feel it was worth the time to read it! I was expecting more raw recipes, only to find that the focus is on incorporating more greens into one's diet. Knowing that, I wouldn't have purchased it... I eat a salad a day, that's plenty, right? Wrong!- according to Viktoria. I am happy to have stumbled across this book, as it provided me with a lot of useful information specifically on this much neglected 'food group' that I had not come across before. I've had other women in my office read it as well, all with good reviews. It is a super-fast read, accessible without being dumbed-down, and one I will pass around plenty I'm sure."
2,Skeptical,"I do believe that people ought to eat better, and should especially incorporate more greens into their diets. I expected this book would be a good introduction into green smoothies and might give me some tips toward healthier eating.The book does contain some recipes and some tips that I found useful.However, the bulk of the book reads like an infomercial, and I found that tone grating. According to this book, drinking green smoothies will get rid of your asthma, eczema, reverse gray hairs, and will CURE CANCER. Really?Excuse my skepticism, but as soon as a nutrition enthusiast claims her particular brand of nutrition will cure cancer, I tend to tune out the rest of the claims. I believe good nutrition is important. I don't believe there is any one magic bullet out there that will fix everyone's problems. A book that claims such loses me as an audience."
2,Nothing ground breaking,"Not a good book. It's interesting but nothing worth spending your money on. It's a glorified newsletter slap together for a book. If you like being treated like a chump by all means waste your money. One third of the book is testimonials about how great the book is. I mean come on. In a nutshell this is the book - monkeys are closest in genes to humans than any other animal. monkeys eat a lot of green leaves, so guess what? Eat lots of green leaves. Don't like eating greens? throw it in a blender with fruit. Wow that's insightful. hahaha. Really dudes, this is a bad book."
2,Save your money,"I give this book two stars for some of the excellent smoothie recipes. Otherwise, save your money, both on the book and a new blender. Reading some of the reviews here, you'd think this lady had discovered the magic elixir of life, as if incorporating green veggies into our diet is some new, radical idea. Granted, she offers an interesting and fun way to prepare and ingest green veggies, so she gets two stars for that. But honestly, wouldn't it be a whole lot easier (and cheaper!) to just eat them as they come?"
5,LOVE GREEN SMOOTHIES!,"One of the few books I promote in my wellness workshops and personally practice on a regular routine! Have lots of my customers doing the GREEEN SMOOTHIES! This book has lots of great info and very innovative!! Just a word of caution: stick to more of the veggie based ones than the fruit based!!Kim Hostetter, ownerAlmond Blossomwww.almondblossomwellness.com"
5,My Bible of Health Books,"I buy this book in bulk and give it away when anyone shows any interest in getting healthy. In my opinion, if someone knew nothing about getting healthy and they quit drinking soda, stopped eating Fast Food, and did one green smoothy a day, it would benefit their health in amazing ways. I ate pretty healthy and added the smoothies into my life and my cholesterol dropped 40 points. It is the best $11 investment anyone can make for their health, and that is why I buy 10 at a time to give them away. I figure if I can change someone's life for $11 then it worth it to buy them in bulk and give them away."
5,i love victoria,"it may be that i just SO adored the boutenko's life story that i would love anything thats thiers, but that said, tho i am no longer doing a raw lifestyle i really appreciate this particular book as i love smoothies and i love victoria so thats all good in my world!"
5,Good Information,"This book helps me realize how important it is to get the right fruits and vegetables in my diet. I have been making smoothies for years now, this helps cement what I already knew about how good they are for you."
5,Green for Life,I would recommend Green for Life by Victoria Boutenko. Since reading her book I drink one quart of Blended Greens every day. Her book has excellent information. Amazing lady!!!
2,Disappointed,"I don't write many reviews but had to in this case.I would not call this a book, but more like a large phamplet. It contains 166 pgs of which only 7 are the green smoothie recipes. Testimonials consist of 45 pgs., thats right 45, way overdone to provide verbage where the rest of the book is lacking.There is very little substance to this 'book'. The obvious message is to consume more greens through the use of smoothie drinks and the author gives very few facts to back up the claims. Though I have never doubted the need to consume far more greens, I wanted to learn of more factual information.I also wanted to see lots of recipes with variety. I was left disappointed there.I never did find any credentials for the author, Victoria Boutenko. I only assume they are good and she is a knowledgeable nutritionist of some sort. But the facts are lacking in this book, would like to see more detail.I cannot recommend the book."
3,"pretty, but don't burn cleanly","The candles look nice, but they don't burn very cleanly. Frequently there would be big globs of wax falling off, sometimes onto the table. Also, the bases of the candles are not a consistent thickness, so many of them don't fit into a standard menorah"
2,Not Heavy Duty or Professional grade,Had this for three years and broke it while trying to straighten a piece of steel. The entire top piece broke from the base.Fine for small jobs but the casting will not hold up to heavy use.
5,THESE PLUGS ARE DYNAMITE!,"Found this a really useful plug, well worth the price. You can pay less, but these babies keep delivering. I for one want reliable components in the vehicles I drive. I haven't been disappointed by their performance."
1,Bosch (4503) FGR7DQI Platinum IR Fusion Spark Plug,"Bosch (4503) FGR7DQI Platinum IR Fusion Spark Plug, Pack of 1I bought 4 of these for my 1999 Toyota Camry. My mileage went down from an average of 25 MPG to 22 MPG. The engine seems to run fine. I ran the plugs for about 3 full tanks of gas and consistently got 22 MPG. after about 1000 miles, I switched back to Denso Iridium plugs. Hope this review helps someone from make the same mistake I've made."
4,Found a treasure!,"I had been looking for this music for such a long time I almost had given up, when I found it at Amazon.com I was thrilled. It arrived on time and it is a fine CD. Loved it."
2,"Not good,not bad","Mishmash of cover tunes along with more progressive sounding Santana.Recordings can sound flat and dull to almost lush.Only about half of it is listenable,the other half sounds like Carlos needed to fulfill a recording contract.I picked it up cheap and it was worth what I paid,but that isn't saying much.If you see it as a cut out ,under 3 or 4 bucks ,go for it ,otherwise buyer beware."
1,Havana Moon SUCKS!,"I have listened to all but 3 of Santana's original CDs. This one is atrocious. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I was left wondering if a crappy radio station was playing.Awarded 1 star since mandatory, more like a cosmic dump ...Listen to Abraxas instead. You are forewarned!:("
3,Not his best - but pivotal.,"This is not by any means the most loved of Santana's many albums and that is exactly why it matters. It is not even available here on amazon.co.uk but luckily I, like several other reviewers, have a trusty vinyl copy to fall back on. After fifteen or so years of ""traditional"" Santana (and I have most, if not all, of those on vinyl too) it marked the point when he branched out in to collaborations. Maybe this didn't work out or was not commercially successful at first (your choice) but by 'Supernatural' in 1999 the boot was on the other foot. I believe a new Santana album, including a diversity of co-conspirators, is due early in 2006.I like Havana Moon, for all its indubitable discontinuities of style, but to give it more than three stars would leave me with problems rating many of his other albums. If for no other reason you should listen to this just once to see where it fits in and, who knows, you might just like it!"
4,Earthy and refreshing music. Sounds like Carlos having fun.,"Carlos travels the musical sideroads on this disc, visiting blues, Tex-Mex, and early Rock,n,Roll. He is wonderfully joined on this trip by Jimmie Vaughan era Fabulous Thunderbirds and by Willie Nelson. The colaborations,much to my surprise, are the strength of the album. It doesn't get much better than hearing Carlos and Jimmie playing off of each other. Willie sounds wonderful on the wistful song, They all Went to Mexico. The Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry covers work well within the context of disc. Ultimately, Havana Moon gives us all what we are really listening for...That wonderful Santana tone. This is fun music."
3,Fit problem,"Would have worked well, I think, but it didn't fit over my particular faucet. and I messed it up by trying to wrap it with tape. (That doesn't work.) If it doesn't fit, send it back."
2,could've been a lot better,"SPOILERS -sorry!I hate it when heroines apologize when they shouldn't. Kyle is a complete jerk throughout much of this book to Sophie. I hated when he was deliberately insulting and even worse when he threatened to have sex with Sophie's cousin. I found myself screaming at Sophie that she could do better. If Kyle wanted her only for her looks and not when she was 40 lbs overweight, she should've dropped him like yesterday's garbage. He never looked for what was inside. Aha-like Kyle wouldn't be cheating on her later on when she's pregnant or when she gets older and has cellulite and crow's feet. Heck, the guy is almost 38 and she's 23. She should've ditched him and moved on with her life. Ok, I know this is only fiction and HR books are not known for strong female characters, but this one did not rate a 4 or a 5 star rating."
1,Not fit a 2000 Chevrolet Blazer 4.3L V6.,"Contrary to what Amazon's compatibility check says, this is not fit a 2000 Chevrolet Blazer 4.3L V6. This item shorter than the current belt."
2,I'm just the Purchaser,"My grandsons will think these are great - hey it's Peyton Manning! However, I was slightly disappointed when I opened the box. I don't quite know what I was expecting - I only know I wasn't overwhelmed when I saw them."
3,Other Books,"Another of the Courtney books. This one follows the adventures of Sean Courtney in the bush. He is leading a big game expedition, with the help of a black tracker. A few problems are to be encountered, like the existence of a small war or two.There is some extremely cheesy melodramatic dialogue, especially of the romantic variety."
3,The finish of the book...,"This is an interesting book of Africa, you learn about the land and the people there, but how many times can a person trick or be tricked by the same person? At the end of the book he left many things at the air, for example: you really don't know what happened with the hunt company of Sean Courtney and other things."
5,Top 10 book with ease,The book flawlessly manages to keep you glued to the pages.Sean Courtney is simply one of the best characters around.It's almost up there with River God and is an exelant book for any adventure loving reader
3,Flashes of brilliance put an implausible ending,"Mr Smith's greatest gift as an author is his insight and experience of Africa and it's inhabitants combined with the capacity to tell a really good tale. Here, once again, he doesn't disappoint. It was rather a disappointment to me however at the end, after seemingly taking the time to think through situations and scenarios, that he offered such an implausible demise for the chief villain. It left me with a lesser opinion of the book."
2,Fell Flat,"I like most Wilbur Smith books I have read, especially the Courtney's in Africa. I am a bit surprised by the choice of Sean as the main character to follow the previous novel Rage. In that book I found both Garrick and Michael Courtney to be more interesting and really, Smith did a good job of revealing Sean to be a somewhat cruel and unlikable person in the last book.The romantic subplot is jokingly cheesy...I mean the dialogue is laughable. It is not really a gripping story. I usually skip the hunt scenes in Smith's books, which usually all have either a lion or elephant hunt. The first half of this book is nothing but: not one--but two; both a lion and then an elephant hunt...yawn.Then it is on to more of the story whose characters I couldn't care less about...hard to finish...and it fizzles rather than bangs. Maybe it is just hopelessy dated and doesn't hold up well taken out of a 1980s context.I would skip it and re-read Monsoon."
3,It is an awful little piece.,"Aaargh! Oh God how I love to hate (and hate to love) this book. In its over-machoism, its super-human characters and its impossibly pathetic erotic scenes this novel really is horrible. I can't stand it! Then why did I give it a rating of 5? Well, it does deserve a 1 for the afore-mentioned reasons, but...it is also one of the most thrilling books I have ever read, it really is a page-turner, the suspense keeping intense throughout every page. And for this it deserves a 10. So I figured I'd compromise with a 5. By the way, in ""London Fields"" the narrator Sam keeps mentioning that he's reading a book that sounds very much like this one and he refers to it as ""an awful little piece of &@34!;. I wonder if it's the same book?"
2,Ethnocentric,"No half-measures with Mr. Smith: The antagonist is black, bisexual and communist. Africa is a chaos except where Europeans or their descendants remained in power.The plot is Rambo-style and action packed to an implausible and even boring degree.Entertaining, but just to while away the time without further expectations.----No hay medias tintas con el Sr. Smith: el antagonista es negro, bisexual y marxista. África es un caos generalizado, excepto en donde los europeos o sus descendientes permanecen en el poder.El argumento es está tan colmado de acción al estilo ""Rambo"" que se vuelve inverosímil y hasta aburrido.Entretenido, pero para pasar el rato sin mayores pretensiones."
3,Captivating and Realistic,"To call this book or Mr. Smith racist would be a mistake. The author demonstrates an intimate knowledge of african politics and is a well informed and well researched writer. You cannot truly grasp african politics unless you have lived there or read a book like this from Wilbur Smith. I have lived in Africa and I found the book illustrating the African struggle to survive in a technology-based era and the consequencial brutality and desperation of its nations to be true to life and riveting. If you want to learn something about Africa, put aside the preconceptions of the liberal media and get ready for a grimly realistic and action packed novel."
5,rocks,As with all of Wilbur Smiths books this one is one of his best. Include in your library. Thank you
2,Not a good Pepper show,"I've seen Pepper live before, and they are awesome, but this show sucked balls. Don't buy this live DVD."
2,pepper,"i was dissapointed, this is the only time i have seen pepper play live and they just clowned around on stage and barely played the songs"
5,Excellent,This is an amazing cd. It's a bit of regae and rock. They have amazingly funny lyrics and they are coming up!
4,Large and cheerful,"The pages are giant, the peek-a-boo safey mirror is fun for baby to imitate the faces on each page, and you can easily show your child the emotions on your own face as you follow along with the story. Holds up well to tough little hands."
2,BLAH,"As a Warren Beatty fan I didnt dislike it enough to not finish it but I remember thinking .. Is it over yet? Not much new information and mostly quotes from other books or articles. There seemed to be a good bit of information on other celebs (also quoted from other sources).I was left feeling as if I really didnt read a biography. In fact I left it at a friends house and I really feel no need to get it back.My advice would be .....SKIP IT but if you really, I mean really, think you want to read this, wait for the paperback or get it at a flea market."
3,Armchair Centurian,"Although the historical material on the History Channel Roman War Machine are very informative, I have to agree with an earlier review that the reinactors look phony. I think the producers of this program should watch the opening scenes of The Gladiator and the battle in Germania, now these guys really look like troops that have been in the field for many weeks. Dirty, tough, and the muddy battlefield in the middle of a German forest - as close to the real thing we could imagine."
5,Best shower head ever.,This is the best shower head ever. We just remodeled our bathroom and I bought 2 different shower heads in dark brown and oil rubbed bronze. They were terrible. I am now painting the shower head to match our bathroom and I pray that it works.W. Laubenheimer
1,Youth Ball Glove from Rawlings,"This item arrived on time, excellent!!!. But, isn't the same that the photo. See the images. Don't worry is Okay."
5,The Best BBQ Tool,These are the greatest BBQ tools! You hook a small piece and flip it over. You can even run it under your piece of meat or fish to loosen it from the grill. A Must Have!!
5,fantastic,the pig tail flipper is a great addition to my grilling tools it is like having a extention to your hand i wish i thought of it
4,This tool impressed my BBQ King Husband,"My husband considers himself the BBQ king, and he had never heard of this tool. After reading about it, I ordered a set for him, and he wasn't sure about it, but once trying it, he agreed that it's a great tool for the BBQ. As he says, it doesn't work well once the food is cooked, or ""fall-apart tender"", but for turning and moving on the grill, it's wonderful!"
3,"Catchy name, cheap quality","They seem to do the trick but the handles are way to short and feel like they will fall of or become loose in the very near future if I continue to use it for heavy pieces like pork shoulder or a large briquette. The handles are my main concern and for the price. When I pick up a heavy cut of meat, the small handle torques the wrist, a longer handle allows some of the weight to be placed on the fore-arm like a fishing pole. The wood on mine has dark stripping imbedded in them like it was made from water damaged wood. ""EZ-Hook"" has much longer hardwood handles and are made in the USA. I will be ordering these for my future gifts to grillers."
5,Pig-Tail Flipper,"As described in your blurb. Look forward to giving as present. However, I ordered a left-handed one and it is not as described."
1,Not impressed,"I was disappointed in this pig tail flipper. I found it awkward to manipulate and the food often slipped off. A pair of tongs works much better. I threw the ""flipper"" away."
1,This pig tail should stay in the pen,"I got this item as a gift this summer. I am a fan of using tongs for most of my grilling and when I cook inside I use tongs or a spatula. This tool feels awkward and off balance compared to the tongs. The holes that are left in meat when trying to use the pig tail, although pretty small, do allow for juices to run precluding the effectiveness of searing the meat. I think this will get hung up on a wall so that fifty years from now people can wonder what it might have been meant for."
4,You'll Flip For These,Get these and BBQ like the pros. I love these pig tail flippers. The only thing that I didn't like is that the metal ring on the wooden handle is not properly fastened (no rivet or nails). After about two months of use this ring comes loose and falls off (that's why I dropped my rating to 4 stars.) You'll only need the large flipper for huge hunks of meat (I've never used the large flipper in over five years.) I think the large and small flippers should be sold separately. The pointed end of the flippers are razor sharp. I have punctured myself by accident on a few occasions (easy to do.) As a BBQ tool it works great and I use these for all my outdoor BBQ's. Spatulas and tongs? Nah! Stick it and flip it :-)
4,The Oxford Picture Dictionary English-Haitian Creole,"Very helpful. I am a visual learner so I really enjoyed having the visual cues to help me practice and remember. I recommend this book as an essential part of the learning package for anyone who wants to learn Creole. However, this book does not help with grammer or prononucation. However, great book for laying the foundation."
3,Haitian Creole Dictionary,It was good when neither of us knew very many words in each other's language. The only criticism of it was that it had things in it that Haitians had never heard of American things such as coupons. It was hard for them to conceive of the idea.
4,Excellent tool for teaching English or just communicating,In the process of adopting 4 Haitian children who know little or no English I have been concerned about communicating with them on the most basic level. I also will be homeschooling them and know that there are areas not covered in a regular English/Creole dictionary. When I purchased this dictionary I had hope that it would be helpful. Little did I know how helpful. This dictionary which has pictures to help understand the concept is going to be an excellent tool for the children as well as for me. I use it now to translate letters to and from the children. It is not a program for teaching English but it will be useful everyday to communicate to the children what I need for them to do and to understand them as well.
5,Useful dictionary,I am the director of a non-profit literacy center. My students always want the Picture Dictionaries and even with their very limited resources are eager to buy them.
3,Problems running the game,"I love the concept of a Weakest Link game, but the program does not run properly on either my Gateway 233 MHz laptop running Windows 98 or my Sony 750 MHz laptop running Windows ME. The program runs too fast, so the characters' comments jumble together, and I only get 25 seconds to play each round instead of a few minutes.Activision's customer support was friendly, but they had no suggestions for fixing the problem other than waiting for them to release a patch or an updated version if enough people have problems running it. I would not recommend purchasing this software until a patch or new version is released. However, I am looking forward to playing it again once that happens."
1,Very disappointed!,"Graphics are pretty bad, contestants are square and they move very jerky. Gives me a headache. It looks like a game from 10 years ago! And, it is very boring when you play by yourself or with just a few players. Who Wants To Be A Milionare PC game is a lot better!"
3,This game is the weakest link! Good Bye!,"This game delivers a pretty weak attempt at bringing the game to the computer. While I realize that it is hard to record Anne saying loads and loads of phrases, they could have done better then the 5 they included. The contestants also say the same things as they talk to Anne about voting people off. For example ""There is something about her that I just don't like"". The her could refer to any female player in the game. As far as the trivia part is concerned, there are loads of questions. So I guess if you are more into the trivia aspect of the game as opposed to the voting off aspect you might enjoy the game. However there is no way to skip the voting people off section. I ended up returning my copy and have been happy without the game."
3,Tears of the Night Sky,"Serious and religious, this story tells about the Cleric of Paladin Crysania. Crysania is very devoted to her god, so when she find out that he may be in trouble, at the suggestion of Dalamar the Dark Elf, she goes on a quest to find the five dragon stones - magical stones that allow one to communicate with a god (among other things). Two of these stones appeared to Dalamar, and the last three are in a place so terrible it is not in her liking to go there. But this blind Cleric will do almost anything to save her god and bring him back to her.If you're an avid Dragonlance fan, this is a good read, but otherwise I recommend pursuing better Dragonlance books (anything by M. Weis and T. Hickman, Douglas Niles, D. Perrin, or Michael Williams)"
3,Almost worth 4 stars!!,"While this book is mainly about Crysania, Dalamar steals the spotlight. Their light sparring is intriguing & fun. There other characters are interesting too. I just feel there was that missing something that could've made it better."
2,Disappointing,"The first thing I want to say is this book should never had been written. Sure the writing is great but I hate the content. Well I am somewhat of a Raistlin fan so I'm a bit biased but that's not the point. The great thing about the Raistlin-Crysania love team is the idea that love transcends the very idea of good and evil. By making Crysania fall for this other guy once agian shows us the prejudices of this world. It's like saying elves could only love elves. This book tells us that Raist's and Crysania's relationship was doomed from the start. They should have left their relationship open ended since the authors obviously have no wish to resolve it. I mean Gilthanas and Silvara where abe to resolve their problems even though Gilthanas openly reviled her. How about Raistlin, doesn't he get the chance for his own hapiness?"
4,One word: Original,"Tears of the Night Sky brings out the emphasis on how hard it is for the revered daughter of Paladine to break loose and learn how to love again. Bestowed with a perilous journey and a dark gift from none other than Dalamar the Dark, Crysania embarks on a mission to find certain meanings to unanswered mysteries. Seeing as how Im probably the biggest Raistlin fan, this book really made me mad. All throughout the Legends Trilogy I had high hopes that Raistlin would change and see what he had going for himself. I had hopes that true love would show up the evil in him, but... Valin al Tandar is by far the best character Ive ever read about. The whole story-line was purely original in my mind. The imagery and other literary devices used by Baker and Berberick brought out the suspense, romance, and intrigue in the book. Ever wonder about Crysania's tiger-guide? Well, here's your answer."
1,I can't believe it...,"This book is so,well there are no words to describe it but i could say stupid,crappy,dumb....I didn't read the whole thing (and i'm glad because i'm going to return it.) just the ending and its really stupid. Whoever likes Crysania/Raistlin (i'm one of them) DON'T read this book its a real dissapiontment, as for people who don't they'll enjoy it i'm sure.But i think that all dragonlance fans probably do like them so i would reccommed everyone not to read it. When i was buying this book i read a few reviews and some of them said its stupid and that they wasted their money i didn't believe them but now i wholeheartedly agree with them...... I wish i never read the ending and i deeply regret buying it."
3,It was an good book. I read it in a day.,I certainly liked the section when Dalamar the Dark transformed a White cleric named Valin into a desert tiger.
3,not bad,"This book seemed kind of plain to me. Nothing exciting really happens even though Crysania makes a journey to Neraka. The Irda, written by Linda Baker alone, was much better."
4,Tears of the Night Sky; Dragonlance,"This book offers an interesting insight as to the escapedes of both Cyrsania and Dalamar. Both characters are protrayed accurately and the addititon of Valin, the white robe, is much appreciated. There is a few inconsistances but oveall the entire effort was excellent. It's a great read!"
3,"A short love story padded out, no thrills but enjoyable","This is more like a romance novel than your usual dragonlance novel. Although it cerainly isn't a bad book I wouldn't consider it essentioal reading, for serious fan's only."
1,Ridiculous,"To be quite honest, this was a disgrace to the Dragonlance series and to every other book ever written. The sophistication of writing is trite and childish. There is absolutely zero development, as well as an abrupt and meaningless ending. In fact, the same information about the characters and plot is written over and over...and OVER again. Even scenes from other Dragonlance books have been copied and ""pasted"" in! A waste of time and good trees..."
4,Dragonlance does romance,"All those who said WHY or ITS A TRAVESTY IT RUINS DRAGONLANCE can shut up like the thirteen year old boys they are. I would like to be a little more rude but I cant. Opinions like that irritate me you should always look for the merits in everything. This is an unusual DL novel but its better than most, it is a little trite and predictable but it is nice and easy to read, give it a go and decide for yourself."
1,Why?,"What was the point to having this book written? None, other than some money. I really didn't like this book, it just seemed meaningless. This whole novel just seemed so flat, even the dialogue was lacking. The simple fact that they brought in some white robe mage called Valin (couldn't they think of a more original name also?) to replace Raistlin is just sad. Nancy Varian Berberick was way over classed in trying to create something between those two characters in one book that could over come the great and complicated relationship of Crysania and Raistlin, especially since the mage was a tiger for more than half the book. You really should stay away from this book; I can't stress it enough. Re-read the Legends if you want to see the real Crysania in action."
4,Mystical Poetry,"This over-sized book--beautifully illustrated in all-color--has a fantasy theme of imaginary friends. But it is far more than it appears, that is--it is not just a children's book, but actually a deeply mystical and poetic adventure; a meditation piece. It's presented with fine unusual art punctuated by short zen-like single sentences; a wandering poetic narrative capturing the magic spirit of childhood in a beautiful way, but also profoundly a metaphysical and philosophic work."
2,Not what you expect,"I was so disappointed in this game. I am a huge Buffy fan, so naturally I bought it. When you first get it, it's like, cool, you fight vampires. But that is ALL you do. The only other thing there is are cartoons that you read before each level. The ""levels"" consist of differently dressed vampires. I found that it was difficult to move Buffy at times, and buttons to move are not well designed--to stake, you have to hav ethe vampire on the ground, press the down key and the A key at the same time to do the act that is the entire point of the game! Granted, there are only so many combinations that can occur, but they could have been placed better. Anyway, unless you really REALLY want to sit around and get frustrated at a little vampire that seems to be draining your energy for no reason, I recommend this game, otherwise, don't wast your money."
1,I was confused,"I had confused the game with the real Buffy game that's supposed to come out on Playstation this year, I think. The Gameboy version is horrible, it's like they just added more vampires each level and nothing else, I was bored out of my mind. But the Buffy game on Playstation is really cool if you ever get a chance to check out the screenshots you should.i'm really not one, I didn't feel like becoming a member under another screenname."
1,what a joke,tip to beat the game: walk from left to right and do some sweep kicks at the angry vampires. Then kill them with you stake with down and A. Repeat twenty times to get to level two. Repeat thirty times to get to levet three. Repeat fourt... oh wait I've got better things to do in my car like counting the threes through the window...
3,It's pretty good.,"I liked the game a lot, I didn't like the way my thumbs looked after performing a lot of Buffy's fighting moves. OUCH! There could have been a better variety of vampires and demons (there were no demons). I liked the plot line a lot. Some of the later vampires are too powerful and recover too fast. It would have been better if they had let Buffy power up throughout the game as well. All hardcore Buffy fans will love it though!"
4,Buffy kickes ...,"I'm a big fan of "" Buffy The Vampire Slayer"". So when I heard from my friend that he bought the game on GAMEBOY color, I knew I had to have it. When I read the reviews about the game I didn't feel convinced, but I got in anyway. The game is really great . The stages are fun to play and the best part is that you get to control Buffy the Chosen One. The game is really easy, all you do is press the down pad, B then approach the vampire & stake it. I'm going to be generous and tell you the password that will help you finish the game: BNPXZ9. I hope you'll enjoy staking vampires, killing Ethan the trouble maker, and have a chance at dusting the dragon that controls all Evil. If you are a Buffyholic then I advise you to buy this game, because it is Action-Packed Buffy episodes for fans on the GO!"
1,Bruce Willis fans..........BEWARE!!!,"Any Bruce Willis fans........BEWARE!!! This album has absolutely NOTHING to do with our beloved Bruno!! How they could even use his name and his sketched face on the cover, is beyond me!! I bought this CD, thinking it was Bruno!! But to my horror, it is just a cacophony of electronic noise, masquerading as music!! I am disgusted!!"
2,Beware of Chinese substitutes!,"Please be careful!Vermont American is not American any more!The tap I received was Chinese made with rather poor finish!Next time it will be an OSG brand!Thank you, Mario"
3,Good but tap size is LARGE,I am not sure why but this size wrench this tap will need is just a hair bigger than 1/2 inch. This means that most standard drivers wont work. I had to put it in with a socket. No idea why they felt it needed to be this big.
3,Dissapointed in item description,"I am disappointed that the item description does not mention what size the square bit on the end of the tap is, making it impossible to purchase the right wrench without prior knowledge. I went ahead and bought the 1/4-1/2"" wrench, also made by vermont american, and was disappointed to find the wrench was too small for this tap. Seller needs to update description with accurate info on this tool."
5,Does the Job Well,"I bought this for a project more than two years ago, I have used it a number of times since then as well.It is very solid with nice teeth that are not showing any signs of wear.It has some surface rust, but that does not affect it's performance.I use it mostly in plastics and composite materials.Well worth the money."
3,Not bad...overly simplistic,"Overall the book helped with the test.The questions in the test prep were significantly simpler and shorter than those on the real test. I could finish the practice tests in half an hour with a score of ~75, whereas the real test required the full 90 minutes for the same score. The book and practice tests did not cover any ""analytical"" questions - where a chart or research project was explained and you had to answer 3 or 4 questions based on an interpretation of the results.I would say approximately 25% of the material covered in the book was on the exam. If you don't already really know Biology, this book will not help. If you DO know Biology, the book will give you an edge, and probably improve your score somewhat."
2,"Is this Book Outdated, or is that just me?","I studied the book and took the three review tests in the back of the back twice. Though I passed the CLEP, there was probably about one third of the information on the actual test that was not in the book, anywhere. Fortunately for me, much of it I knew about and was able to answer the questions. I would say get this book, but get another one if you can that covers these other subjects."
2,Software is Windows ONLY compatible,I carefully scanned the product description and nowhere does it say that the CD-Rom is Windows ONLY! Forget about using it if you have a MAC.
3,Not sure this book would do the job unless you already know a great deal,"I used this book as scored consistenly passing grades on the practice tests, but when I took the actual clep examination I was surprised to find out how little of the material in the book was actually on the test.I have a decent background and work in a biology related field and still there were some areas I had to guess at. I passed with a 58 so that's ok, but I do not think I would have passed without knowledge beyond that the book provided. All things considered perhaps 30% of the test was not even alluded to in the book. Also the syle of questions differed from the practice questions requiring the student to extrapolate the data needed to solve the questions from story problems - very much like IQ tests do."
4,Good General Biology Overview,"The CLEP Biology prep book gave a good general summary of the topics covered. It does not go in-depth, but it is a great review. I highly recommend getting the $10 CLEP Biology Exam Guide from the official CLEP website - it gives great examples of actual test questions and outlines the topics included on the test. I studied mostly with the REA CLEP Biology book and reviewed a few subjects in the Cambell college level Biology text...my score was a 74 (which is consistent with my practice test scores). Not a bad study guide for the price!"
3,"decent help, but not enough","the book was great in covering material and condensing it for easy reading, but it wasnt enough. I used this book in conjunctuion with wikipedia and other online sources. this was the hardest clep test i have taken so far and I passed with a 58. if youre planning on clep'ing bio, i recommend using some outside sources aas well."
2,Book Is Not Enough,"I read the reviews and bought this book, studying for 3 weeks. Scoring 98 on all the tests I was pretty confident of passing. The CLEP test had only a handful of questions that were recognizable and subject matter that is not covered is more than l/2 the test. Unless you are good in biology and I was, I recommend something else. I have passed other CLEPs but this one was so different from the study material. I scored a 48 which is not good enough. I am very disappointed given the time I studied and the tests in the book which did not help me."
1,Don't use this unless you guess real good....,"This book was not helpful at all. The test was complete application of concepts, and this book contained nothing like it, and the practice tests are nothing like the real tests. I completely guessed on at least 85% of the test, and by the grace of God got a passing score of 54!! Definitely look for something else."
1,Not quite prepared,"I bought this and studied for 2 weeks. Took test, got a 50...the bare minimum to pass. The test was alot harder than the book. The book only prepared me for 10% of the test. I completely guessed on everything else. My suggestion is to find another resource."
1,Do Not Even Bother,"The front of the book states: ""Based on offical exam questions released by the College Board.""Well, that's misleading. I took the exam August 2008; twenty percent of the exam was on material in the book.The front also says: ""Target review of all exam topics."" There were several questions in a row with a lab as a model, as well as topics not covered in the book including HIV, vaccines, etc.It is not, as the front of the book states, ""The best test preparation for the CLEP Biology."" Studying the book was a major waste of time. As you can tell, I didn't pass the exam. Came close, but didn't pass it due to the questions that came from left field. CLEP will also get a letter of complaint. Do not get this book! A waste of money."
3,The Best Test Preparation for The Clep Biology,"I recently took the Biology Clep Exam (November 2) and scored a 48 (50 needed to pass). I studied for 2 months. I knew this book in and out -- the Sample Prep Tests 1-3 and the reasons why the other answer selections were not correct. However, I do believe you need to study another Biology book -- I felt maybe a handful of questions were questions I recalled from the Clep Study Guide and the others were foreign to me -- you really had to know your biology to answer these questions (i.e., quite a few case scenarios with charts and graphs). Good Luck!"
3,Decent but definitely not enough,"The CLEP Biology exam is definitely much more difficult to tackle than the study guide is. The study guide does cover most of the basics of Biology but I found that the actual exam is much more in depth. I would suggest going to a used book store and studying from a biology text book for foundation and then use this study guide to pin point your strengths and weaknesses. There are lab questions on the CLEP exam so be prepared. I studied for three weeks with this book and some websites and I found myself guessing for at least 50% of the test. I passed with a score of 60 but that was cutting it pretty close for me. Give yourself more time, study from at least two other sources thoroughly and use this study guide as no more than an a guide that is easier than the actual exam."
3,"The practice CD great, but...","The practice CD that came with the book was great. It really helped in practicing the taking of the test. The practice tests and book did not prepare me for the actual CLEP (made ""A""'s on practice exams). I studied textbooks, and flashcards intensely before taking the CLEP, and barely passed. This book did not increase my learning of the material, but did help with practice-testing on a computer."
3,"It worked, but not how I thought it would.","So after studying really hard for a week and a half using only this book, I signed up for the test. The test is hard, and what this book will do is expose you to the information so you can make an educated guess. This book is almost like the studying aid for the test before you take the CLEP test if that makes any sense. I have found the same issue with the sociology prep book. So in the end with only about two weeks of studying, this 28 year old whos last bio class was in '01 got a 52 so take from that what you can I guess."
3,Enough to pass.,"The book does a fairly good job of covering about 70% of the exam content, however I saw many questions on the exam that weren't addressed at all in the book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with absolutely no background in biology, unless that person is a prodigious memorizer, whereupon they could probably pass the test. This is an adequate review for someone with a general background. My last biology class was AP Biology 13 years ago, and reading through this book was enough to score an A on the exam with the help of much testing experience (i.e. process of elimination).My recommendation to supplement this book would be specific study of molecular biology to include names of all the molecular components of DNA and associated processes of DNA replication, transcription, and protein synthesis which the book does not cover in detail at the molecular process level."
2,CLEP Biology,I read this book and did quite well on the practice tests. The actual exam was much harder and included information not in the study guide at all. I did not pass - I made a 48. This book was informative but I feel additional books need to be studied in order to be adequately prepared for this exam.
3,Clep Biology,"This is my 6th clep test and I have passed all my previous Clep tests, but by far biology was the hardest. This book alone will not help you get a passing score unless you have a strong background in Science it's a great suppliment. An old college textbook as a extra study tool should help you pass. I like REA Clep guides and have used them for my western civ cleps this one needs a few more details but a good suppliment."
3,Best as a quick review before the exam!!,"This book should not be used as the sole prep for the exam. The topics are not deep enough. Even CLEP recommends using actual college Biology texts as the means of preperation for the exam, along with reading articles with latest Biological developments (like in disesaes and proceedures etc). This book served as a good cram reference before the exam, but a college text is needed for real overall prep. Some lab experience would be needed also, because of the analytical parts in the exam that have tables of results from experiments carried out, but it is not needed to pass. Buy this book if you are short on time but I recommend a college text to go with it. GOOD LUCK!!!"
3,Not what I would have hoped for...,"I made the mistake of using this book exclusively for my test preparation. After studying for months and knowing the book almost backwards and forwards, I took the test and failed. I was surprised to find that out of all of the test questions I could only answer about fifteen of them. The other questions were foreign to me, and some of them even mentioned things I'd never heard of. This book is okay, but don't do like I did and only use it for test preparation. Be sure to get other study guides as well."
2,Book covers little,"I took the Biology Clep test yesterday and I passed it with a 68. However, most of the questions on the exam were not covered in the review. I actually wasn't for sure whether I passed or not. I attribute my higher score to luck and common sense but not to this book. The test was definitely harder than I expected and I studied a lot."
1,do not under any circumstances use this product,"Source Code Management, no doubt, is a vital part of any development shop. Any team based development effort needs a centralized repository in which to store their work.That being said, I would implore you to choose another product - such as the open source CVS (which can hook into VS.net with the right plug-ins).VSS is a buggy, unreliable, unbearably slow...and fundamentally unuseable product. This is *not* the sort of system you should use hold vital data that ammounts to months and months of hard work.For your sanity and your time, DO NOT buy this product. As each version seems to bring very little in the way of rethinking this disaster, Microsoft has made it very clear that they could care less about source control.(by the way, MS doesn't even use this product in-house)."
4,Not all bad,"Contrary to what many may say, this really isn't a bad product. I've used it for years and have found it quick, reliable and easy-to-use. Our company used CVS (mostly because it's free and it has the basic necessities) but the database was corrupted and the check-in/check-out process wasn't as intuitive. In 7 years, I've never had a VSS database fail me.I agree that VSS hasn't had any major innovations in a VERY long time... Some reports would be greatly appreciated as well as the ability to see exactly what the differences are between two MS Word docs or Excel spreadsheets (they're Microsoft products too for goodness sake!) but overall it's a decent tool."
2,hasbro has gone re-issue crazzzy!,unless you are a completist (like steve sansweet) you probably already bought this figure 3 years ago with the attack of the clones/saga collection card it is no different except that it doesn't have any accessories as it the former mentioned had.
5,"Best Star Wars figure, period","I didn't collect figures from the Prequels until ROTS, so even though this figure may have been issued before, it was new to me. What a great figure, though! I would have loved to have had this when I was five back in 1978. It really is a kid's dream come true, as far as action figures go. No more making those boops and beeps on your own. Now kids will have the real movie sound effects built into their Artoo unit. I think the only figure that might compare, as far as quality and value, is the battle-damaged Anakin Skywalker on Mustafar, which I am having so much trouble finding outside of eBay."
3,Product size is of the BOX!! not the Toy,Before I buy a product I do check the size and weight of the product. With this toy the product dimensions are 1.7 x 5.9 x 9.1 inches. When I got the toy I had a bad surprise: the dimensions listed where of the BOX of the toy so now I have a tiny 2.5 inch tall R2D2 :(
1,Disappointed,"Was I in for a shock when I received this toy. The product information given was the size of the box and not the size of the toy. I believe this was sold under false pretense and it was false advertising. I am going to pursue this issue further if I cannot receive a refund. The cost was for a 2"" tiny toy that I cannot give my three year old grandson for Christmas. What a joke. There was no mention that it was a collectable toy item."
4,Vickie Winans Fitness Hustle,"I love to dance, and this video gave me another dance to add to my repertoire of dance routines. It is so much fun to me."
2,Exercise,"Did not like it. A little to slow for my taste, wasn't what I expected. Never used it again and probably never will."
2,Work out,This work out video is slow paced and easy to follow. It is fun and the music is great. This work out video can be used by people of all ages.
5,Something different,"Luckily for me, this is the first Madeleine Brent book I read and also the first one that he/she wrote.It got me hooked on his/her writing. Of course after you have read the next few books, you see that there is a definite pattern to his/her work. A heroine who is alone, friendless but with lots of spirit who manages to prevail over great adversity.Part of the joy of reading a brent are the exotic locales although this book is set primarly in Britain. A unique writer who is head and shoulders above the rest."
1,This video made me wish Wal-Mart had a video return policy,"I did not like this video. First of all I thought the tape was of poor quality, especially with all of the hype the Buns of Steel video series gets. The excercises themselves were great, I worked ab muscles in ways I'd never thought of before. But the lead lady's irritating voice never quieted (and often her sidekicks) eventually giving me such a headache I couldn't stand to do the video again. If peppy remarks like ""Oh, oh, this is great, I love to work those abs"" are your kind of thing you may like this video. The ""sidekicks"" kept complimenting the ""leading lady,"" the women seem so fake, I lost interest in it. I'd try Cindy Crawford's Total Body Workout instead, it works every muscle in your body and its even suitable for beginners."
1,Not the original,"When I bought this, I was hoping to be getting the old Webb original. The packaging is, I feel, intentionally misleading, banking on the popularity of the original Abs of Steel. The Tamilee Webb version was a bare boned, cheapy, that worked. I hated this video right from the start. I'm sure this workout can work, if you like the instructor(s). I didn't. I'll look at lot closer at the box next time."
5,abs of steel what a deal,"I had previously owned this tape but had gotten rid of it. It is a great workout for people of all fitness levels. It is fun and has great music. If you buy this tape, you will not regret it."
1,good exercises-terrible presentation,"although the description on the box describes the music as ""todays top hits"", some of the songs are actually from the early eighties! as someone who finds music very motivational, i found that unnacceptable. between the extremely annoying insructors (bring back tammy from classic abs of steel) and the outdated music, i would not recommend this video to anyone."
1,i hate this video,i got bored way too fast with in my first time watching the video and most videos work up to the intense parts this one has you doing stuff i thought was just plain rediculous.i hated this video i think that it is really for advanced fitness levels. (stuff like one arm push ups)
1,ABS of what?!,"I just bought this video and tried it this morning. I was very disappointed. I was to busy trying to fiqure out the moves to get it. At one point my lower back started to kill me, I couldn't do the moves that they were doing. I had a baby 5 months ago and thought this would help. My abs didn't burn except for maybe 2 times. She didn't stay on one exercise long enough for me to feel the burn. Just when I did she was changing to some strange move again. By the time I fiqured out how to do that one, off again we go. The warm up was ok, but went downhill from there. I got a better burn in my arms with the many, many pushups. On the front it says hit music, NOT quite. Not that I don't mind eighties music, but thats not hit music to me. Once the Michael Jackson song started I felt like I was going to scream. My experience was horrible with this video, and as I see a few others. Save your money!!!"
5,Improbable ... but good!,"OK, I admit the story has many impossible incidents, twists and turns... that makes it less believable. However, what matters was that one guy was real all through it: Forrest. Especially touching was his relationship with ""little Forrest"" ... and the way his innocence never left him."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I was absolutely amazed to see the number of positive reviews this book has received on this site!For me, the allure of the original book (and movie) was that however unlikely and improbable Forrest's adventures were, there was the thought that ""well, I suppose it COULD have happened that way."" Not so with this book (see especially the World Cup game). The way he ""coincidentally"" happens to run into all his friends in the most remote and random places on the globe wears thin very quickly. What's worse, the threads linking each of Forrest's ""episodes"" together in this book are so thin that I can't even floss my teeth with them.For my money, this may be the worst book I've read in the 1990s."
3,I felt that this book was hilarious but stupid!,"After watching the hollywood movie of forrest gump, this sequel book seemed different. I admit that the stories were funny but the whole book didn't really have a point. It was mainly about a stupid guy who becomes involed in stupid things!"
1,Worst book I've read in ten years,"So I read this book after reading the first one since I bought both for about a buck plus shipping on Amazon. This has got to be one of the worst books I've read and the worst book I've read in the last ten years.Groom throws Gump into one historical scandal after another without even trying to make it clever. Not to mention that there is no consistency with the first book.When I went to read the Gump books, I thought that I would get a humorous but touching portrait of a mildly retarded gentleman, much like the movie. What I got was horse manure. I couldn't finish the damn thing."
1,A GREAT sequel!!!,"Why is this a great sequel? Because it is every bit as crappy as the first installment. If you are such a wealthy person that you do not need money for ANYTHING else, go ahead, be my guest ... WASTE your money on this. Personally, Id rather eat shrimp excrement than read another novel by Winston Groom.ZERO STARS!!!"
2,New Coke in book form,"Save your money and wait on the inevitable movie sequel. Gump & Co. resembles Forrest Gump only in the transfer of some characters and well-worn linguistic twists. Like New Coke....who needs it?Groom's effort will no doubt lead to a movie deal someday and I hope the screenwriter(s) are able to completely revamp are pare down (start with the Saddam Hussein and Oliver North bits) this droll book.Those who saw only the movie and didn't read Forrest Gump will find a number of character anomolies in Gump & Co. I just wonder how the movie (and original book) could be so warm while this sequel is cold and rather flat. To his credit, Groom has interjected some bits of genuine humor like naming Ivan Bozosky instead of you know who. Wouldn't Mike Milkedem have been more true than Milligan? Anyway, I'll be interested to see the movie and Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump dealing with Tom Hanks the actor in New York."
2,Very disappointing,"I was not very happy with this book at all. I was thrilled to find that there was a sequel to the first book so I rushed to get this. I couldnt even finish it.There were a few funny parts in the book, like Forrest and his son starting a hog farm, and Forrest coming up with a great taste for the (if I can remember correctly) horrible tasting ""new coke"". But other than that Groom took good characters from the first book and ripped them to pieces. I wanted to cry.Pass this one up."
3,A good book with a little too many good things.,"Winston Grooms proved to us that he had a great amount of creativity, but I think he took it a little too far. The book would have been fine if he left out the ""New Coke,"" deal and the ""Holy Land Theme Park."" Sadly, the book turned too crowed with so much happening so quickly, and with too little detail. However, Forest's character was wonderfully developed and displayed through the grammatical errors and poor english he used to write the book with. All around it was a good book, but with too many good things."
4,Very funny but sometimes unrealistic and predictible,"Gump & Co. is a very good book and tells where all your favorite characters ended up. The only thing i didn't like was it's predicibillity ( Gump does something, causes a riot, gets chased out of town). But overall a good book"
1,The Antithesis of Forrest Gump is this sequel.,I picked up this book in its first week out. As I began reading it I saw humor in the New Coke foul-up. It all went down hill from there. I kept telling myself it would get better. It didn't. Then it became a challenge to see if I could finish the book. Why did I do that? Wah ta waste of time
2,Winstom Groom sells out to the movies,"The original Forrest Gump was a wonderful book, written in the tradition of One Flew over the Cukoo's Nest, but Gump and Co. is simply Winston Groom writing a sequel to a popular movie--and completely ignoring his own original work. He tries to capture the feeling that the movie had, but it all just becomes one long, contrived nightmare. It is tragic that such a good book had to be followed by such a horrible sequel. I'm hoping that Mr. Groom returns to his former glory with his next book"
5,The best,"After reading and watching the movie Forrest Gump, I just got blown away. I wondered if there would ever be a seequel...welll my prairs have been answer . This is all that I have expected , maybe more. I hope they make the movie"
1,Did not finish,"Even Will Patton, the reader, could not save this book on tape. I could not finish the first side, much less both tapes. Gave it away."
5,Pleasant read.,"I was thrilled with how quickly (and cheaply)my book was shipped. Cute story, but alot if it was in the movie."
1,Bird Cage Liner!,"This is truly horrible writing. I mean, really, it's so bad that I can't sit through more than two pages at once. If I had a bird, this would be a good cage liner, however. As it is, I'm throwing it away. It's too awful to inflict on anyone else. I bought my copy of this book at the Dollar Store and believe me, I overpaid. Simply awful stuff."
1,Not worth 1 star. What a waste of time!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Forrest Gump"" as well as seeing the movie. In fact, I still own copies of both. So when I found ""Gump & Co."" at a local used books store I was excited at the prospect of wrapping myself into the delightful world of Forrest Gump once again. Hey, there is even a review from Kinky Friedman right on the front cover so this must be good! How wrong that turned out to be! Forrest becomes the fall guy for every down turn event of the 80s decade. From New Coke to Iran Contra to the Exxon Valdez to meeting Tom Hanks (wherein Hanks blabs off some ""Gumpisms"" -- ugh!!!) to accidentally capturing Sadam Hussein. Give me a break! When the author had Forrest & Little Forrest getting tossed into the White Water scandal I finally decided I had had enough and I jumped to the last 2 pages. This was a waste of time. I have no doubt why there isn't a sequel to the Oscar winning movie."
1,The worst!,This book just made me angry. It seemed as if the author took a history book and tried to come up with tie ins.
4,Gump & Co. is a ok book,"Gump & Co. is a good book. You'd have to read the first book (Forrest Gump) to get whet happens in this book. Winston Groom has a way of making every thing that he writes funny. Because Forrest Gump is ""special in the head"", he gets into trouble.A very good book that most people should read.four Star book"
2,Decent but nothing great,"Basically this book is a booring rehash of the first book. Groom was obviousely riding the success of the movie with this one. Well the story begins pretty much where the first book left off and Forest is rich... very rich. He meets up with little forest and the two have adventures that take them all over the country. Same basic stuff as in the movie, great feats, amazing luck, bla bla bla, but here here they are mostly just plain silly - like the part when he gets poop all over the town. It indeed is worth a couple laughs as this was the first time in my life that I actually laughed out loud while reading a book, but thats about it. The writing just seems rushed and tiresome. Nothing great here folks unless you're a big Gump fan."
4,Art Fun: Tiki Facts & Lore,"A good read and a great look! Wonderful photos of the ""real"" tikis as well as contemporary re-incarnations in sculpture of Schmaltz and popular paintings by Shag. In a refreshingly non-academic style, the short readable essays offer lots of facts about the lovable, fascinating tiki icon past and present."
5,Dawn of Magic,"Night of the Tiki will enlighten you to all the sensorial beauty, mystery, and majesty of thisancient art form. It will also show you the Tiki's place in current culture and its influence ofvarious art genres. The book tells this tale with beautiful photography and poeticwords.It is a purely entertaining, enjoyable read into the privative world of tribal art that still has aplace in toady's world."
5,Whopeee,"I dithered between this hulking monster and a smaller brand-new item, but then I remembered that I'd never said ""This machine is too powerful."" Maybe we were lucky, but we couldn't tell what had been reconditioned. Yes, it's heavy but we aren't carrying it in our backpack. Yes, measure carefully, because it might be too tall to fit under your cabinets (not ours). It's not right for every lifestyle, but if your idea of heaven is a pantry stocked with a year's supply of homemade food, then when this honey bites into a triple-recipe massy batter with a steady, workmanlike beat, you're going to be thrilled, thrilled, thrilled at this bargain.Too bad they don't make a John Deere edition in green and yellow."
4,Better than expected,"I have put off this purchase for a long time and now I wonder why I waited so long. This mixer corrects all the faults of my 4.5 qt. Kitchaide Mixer. I hated to start my old mixer because it caused flour or powdered sugar to fly all over the kitchen. Not this model,I don't even need the shield. Also the larger bowl of the 6 qt. allows for easier adding of ingriedents. I am a quantity baker, I always double cookie recipes etc. and this mixer handles the larger quantities with ease. The 4 stars are because I am waiting to see how it performs in the first 6 months and if I have any problems because it is reconditioned. Keeping my fingers crossed for 6 months plus 1 day."
5,Works great,"Mixer arrived early, good condititon and works well. I would reccomend to others. Great deal for a good product..."
5,Love it!!,"I got my kitchenaid 6qt. stand mixer about 3.5 years ago. I use it at home at least once a week. I've used it to make all kinds of things... stiff cookie dough, whipped cream, cakes. I even made my sister's wedding cake with it, which I wouldn't have been able to do without the mixer! It mixes thoroughly, doesn't require much bowl scraping. We use it often with the meat grinder attachment, which saves money. I can store all my attachments right in the bowl, and I leave the machine on my kitchen counter. It's too beautiful to put away! I didn't think I'd use it very often when I got it, but now I don't know how I ever lived without it!"
1,BEWARE - This product is terrible,"You would think such a simple item would work. I did for about a week, then it just failed. In fact, I bought 2 and the second one JUST failed, which prompted me to come on to Amazon and warn potential buyers. The first one I bought because IT failed. That is a total of 3 Dynex hubs that worked for about a week then died. No wonder why it's so cheap.Dynex products are terrible and consistently fail. Beware."
3,"Buyer beware, this device supports USB 1.1 and not the faster USB 2.0.","If your needs only require slow data rates then this is a great price on a USB hub. However, if you're moving lots of data such as digital images, printer output, video, etc. then you will get an ulser waiting for this device to do its job. In most instances I'd recommend you spend a few dollars more and buy a USB 2.0 compatible USB Hub because throughput requirements are only going to increase."
2,Great while it worked...,"Same problem as some other people mentioned. While it worked for about a year, it was great. Then just stopped working about a week after warranty was finished. Very poorly built. Would not buy again."
1,Didn't work for me,I purchased this reader in hopes of speeding up my download of digital photo files. I got it to work after a few attempts but then it would hangup my computer running win2000. I tried it on another computer running winxp and it worked once on that computer too before it hung up that one. An email to lexar proved worthless since they chose not respond to my problem. I returned the unit back to amazon.com
4,Fast and easy to use,"I received the reader as a gift last night, plugged it into my Mac running OS X without installing any software, and it worked fine with both iPhoto and ImageCapture.My initial test showed that with my memory card, this was about twice as fast as connecting the camera through a USB connection -- nice, but I was hoping for faster.The device is also a bit bigger than I expected.I am fairly happy with this, although if I had not received this as a gift, I would have to think about whether being twice as fast as a USB reader is worth the extra cost."
2,Good at first but then died,This product worked fine for about a year and then died. It seems as this is a common problem. Be careful.
4,A book worth spending time on!,"Well i was suggested this book by my father.I had heard about this book but never thought that i would like it so much,so as to write about it here.Well this is one of the best and the most heart soothing novels read by me.It defines simplicity and compassion -love is not just about staying together in the physical sense..but much more than that!"
2,They should have removed the price tag!,"The necklace itself is lovely. It is delicate. I would have been much more pleased except for one thing. My cost was $18.99 plus shipping. It arrived in a tiny baggie with the price of $8.50. That is one super make-up! They could have at least taken off the price tag before they mailed it, and I might not feel like such a sucker!"
1,no wonder its rank is 2 100 679 (as of today),too much like a vanity press booknot my idea of great science fictionprofessor's wife is murdered witnesses saw him running from the scene bizarre events turn his life into nightmare a clone has been created by a biologist prof battles clone and crazy biologist while avoiding the policean original commonwealth publications book commonwealth was supposedly out of business but books appear to be sold by picasso since they list this commonwealth book in their (picasso) current catalog
5,timing belt,"I initially ordered the ""timing belt comp kit"" which turned out not to have a timing belt in it, pulleys only. Amazon sent out this belt, free of charge."
5,Unbelievably Great Performance,"Isle of Wight, 1970, chaos, grumpy hippies, Joni Mitchell in tears on stage, Jim Hendrix's last major gig, and out of this comes a recording of such stunning perfection as to almost leave the listener breathless. Ian Anderson has such a presence in this recording, the band is incredibly tight, the songs are excellent, and excellently played. All I can say is, you haven't heard live Tull until you've heard this, it's amazing. 5 very big stars, and a request to Amazon for a few more. Get this cd!"
4,This tour has been released before...,"IF you own the 25th Anniversary Box Set, then you know that this set list is virtually the same as the one in the box. I really like the Carnegie Hall show included in the box set, and therefore probably wouldn't buy this. I would have preferred a DVD of this show rather than another version of it on CD...If you don't own the box, and this set is anywhere near as good as the Carnegie Hall show, then pick this up, because it will rock your world...I wish Tull was still like this today"
5,Live at the Isle of Wight 1970,"This is Jethro Tull at it's peak, sounding as good as the studio album and the quality of the recording is great"
5,The Birth Of Grunge?,"Sure, the recording's not perfect, but there's no denying the energy here. For a band usually associated with crispness and precision, it's refreshing to hear Tull let their hair down (and boy did they have hair in those days!), crank the amps to 11 and let 'er rip!I too wish that live Tull recordings would retain Ian's often hilarious between-songs patter, as this as is integral to a Tull show as the musical virtuosity and visual humour.Nonetheless, this album is a lot of fun. Also recommended is the ""Message to Love"" Isle of Wight film--a hilarious counterpart to ""Peace and Love"" Woodstock--hippies gone bad!!"
1,OUTRAGEOUS RIPOFF,"When I saw this ""pamphlet"" (hardly justifies being called a book) ranging in price from about $22 to $40+ being offered from Amazon, I was expecting something worthy of that high price. When I ordered it, I thought it would be a reasonably large book, filled with useful information, and I expected that I would be getting in return what I paid for it. What a huge shock and disappointment I got when the book arrived! I wouldn't call it a book but rather a thin pamphlet of only 72 pages (the first page begins on page 9 . . . so actually, there's only 63 pages). I read through it entirely in less than 45 minutes (average reading speed). There was very little useful information in this pamphlet, most of which is abundantly available in other books. If I had the opportunity to preview this pamphlet before buying it, I would have expected to pay only a few dollars for it. But, at the price I paid for it ($26.45), it is an ""OUTRAGEOUS RIPOFF"". CAVEAT EMPTOR (buyer beware)."
4,cool little player,I like this player. It's small enough to fit in purse or pocket. Easy to download songs and holds alot of music.
4,Awesome little MP3,You cannot go wrong with this easy to use MP3 player from Trekstor. It's ready to use out of the box and plugs directly into your computer without the use of any cables. It's powered by one AAA battery that will last you 10 hours plus. There is also a neat little FM tuner on this device. I would recommend this to anyone looking to store music for personal purpose. Excellent unit!
4,Great now that I understand it!,"Device was showing nothing on the display when I got it, and still periodically loses the display. I have to reinstall the firmware each time. Note if you're having problems- get the firmware version 2.09.92.09 from Support@datastation.us. Do not use version 10 from the Trekstor website as it has problems with the volume (per Datastation). Also remove the battery before reinstalling the firmware. Now that I've figured that out I think I'll get a lot of use out of this. I save all my music to a 4GB card rather than the device, so I don't lose it with the firmware installation."
2,Was a good buy at first,Wonderful for the first 3 months I used itevery thing did as it should then it DIED !!nothing to do with batteryswould not turn on no matter what I triedvery sad I loved it when working
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money on this crappy item. It was good for the first month or so but now it is having problems. Some of the buttons are beginning to give me trouble. They simply don't work anymore. Go for a better unit. Too bad. You really do get what you pay for.
1,Not that great,"Nice size butRadio not great, lously receptionStill havent been able to load music, followed instrutions, but they were not clear"
1,So far...a real dud!,"Came set with a language other than English (did not even recognize what it was) or any of the other languages common to North America. Did not get a prompt reply from help desk. Had to re-load the firmware to change the language as I could not follow the instructions on the screen to re-set the language. Found the menus, finally in English, to be less than logical or intuitive. Main function keys appears to be malfunctioning. Finally, it east batteries like a teenager eats pizza. Do not recommend."
2,Not for me,"I bought this wanting an inexpensive (5 stars for that) mp3 player. I'm returning it for a more expensive Creative Muvo, (which this was meant to replace after I broke the Muvo.)Pros: features; mp3's, voice recordings for lectures (although I didn't try out this feature), fm radio, additional storage capacity with memory card.Cons: battery runs out when the unit is off, even when the ""hold"" button is activated. There's also a delay when you press a button before the screen shows your selection, so you don't know if the screen isn't changing because you didn't press the button hard enough, if you press it a second time, the first hit is registered along with the next and you end up passing your desired selection. For a crowded train or walking around town, having to stop, stare at the screen, press the button, wait for it to register, press again and wait again to scroll to your song or folder, is not worth the trouble.If you're not ""on the go"", this is a fine product."
3,Nice player but not loud enough,"I like the small size of this MP3 player and the unlimited storage from SD cards. Radio reception is only OK, picks up only strong stations. Only tried the voice recorder once and it worked. But the playback is too soft. I listen mostly to classical music and even with volume cranked to the max it's impossible to hear the quiet passages. I suppose I could get an amp, but then that's 2 things to carry.2 other gripes: The LCD display is hard to read. It slowly scrolls the song titles letter by letter which I find really annoying and the contrast is poor. And it's tedious to pick songs from the menu. Not like an iPod, where you can zip through a long list of songs and find the one you want. This one makes you click a button to go down one, then wait for about a second before you can click again."
4,Terrific in every sense of the word.,Great value pack of three must have movies for the Horror aficionado. For me The Thing is the greatest horror flick ever made but the inclusion of the modern day Classic Day Of The Dead and Romero's Land Of The dead make it an essential purchase.The only thing that stops it getting full marks is the fact that there are virtually no special features on two of the discs.
5,comfy shorts for hot yoga,"The material of these shorts is great. It's thick enough to cover up the boys without needing a jock strap. The don't hold water, so when doing hot yoga, it help keep the sweat moving off. The seller was quite prompt with the order. I will order again when I need to replace these - but it looks like it will be a while as the quality is very good."
4,Really Short,"These shorts are nicely made of a good fabric for practicing yoga. However, they are extremely short. I opted to trade them in for the somewhat longer version. These work great and are more modest. Sizes seem to be a bit small, so buyers might want to go to the next size up."
4,Excellent Customer Service,"These are really nice shorts. Not tight like bike shorts, they are very stretchy and fairly modest (there are only two layers of thin fabric up front but the extra layer extends into a thin panel in the back as well.) After a week of use I noticed there was some extra material extending out of the rear seams on that back panel, on the inside of the short. It did not really interfere with the comfort or appearance, but one could tell it was not right. I went ahead and took a photo and sent it to Drishti, to see what they would say. Somewhat to my surprise - I mean it was a small detail - they immediately apologized effusively and sent me a new pair of shorts, and did not ask for the old ones back! Really excellent customer service. Also, the shorts are made in the USA."
3,Best Available but...,"We tested a variety of typing software programs and Mavis was clearly the best. All typing software programs purchased had software glitches including version 12. It is unfortunate to lose the ""History"" of your typing progress. Our program locked up regularly and we needed to sign in under another user. SAD.."
1,"""Buggy"" for sure!",I gave this software as a gift. It looks like I'm going to have to buy another--NOT another copy of this one! A few wrong keys hit and the CD has been wiped clean and there is no help to be had.Mavis Beacon--if you see this review--please HELP!
2,Well...maybe start with one of his other albums.,"I was pretty disappointed with this album. It's not horrible, but it sure isn't really good. CTK's guitar sounds thin, angry, and buzzy - not at all what I expected from a 'bluesman' of any mark. The songs are OK, but the standout track is a cover of Prince's 'Kiss'. I might try one of his more acoustic-oriented albums next, but $14 doesn't just grow on trees, you know!"
5,Takes me back to my childhood...*sniff*,Very true to the 80's arcade original. Great graphics and lots o' levels for plenty o' fun.
2,"$75 FCC fee, No NOAA Weather, 1 watt output","I ordered 2 T6400s, but am returning them for a couple of reasons.- This model does NOT support NOAA weather radio channels.- The FCC license fee is $75 per call sign (per FCC web site).- The power output is 1 watt maximum (GMRS radios can be up to 5 watts).I already have an ICOM M3A handheld marine radio for kayaking, and I will buy a second instead of using the Motorola radios. The Marine radios have a 5 watt output, but are about twice the size. If you are looking for a small 2 way radio, look at the T6300 1/2 watt FRS instead. They currently have a $25 rebate, and you'll save the FCC fee."
3,This product does not support Weather Channels!,I spoke with Motorola and they confirmed that this product does not support Weather Channels. The editorial review on Amazon.com for this item is not correct.
3,"Nice, when it works!","I've had this radio since november 2001 and i found it very good at the begining. I had a problem with a radio because the speaker fails from time to time so i had to buy a hands free while i had it repair. I sended it back to Motorola, and aparently the solved the problem at no cost for me because of the warranty. Now, over 6 months later, the other radio (wich has not been repaired) is having the same problem as the first one, So what's the deal? do they had a problem making this radio or just back luck for me, now i have to pay to repair it bcause the warranty has expired. I don't even use the radio everyday so it can't be Overuse or something like that, hope someone from motorola read this."
4,Worth the money,"Yes you need a FCC license, but if you are buying [the] radio you can afford [the]...month[ly fee] for the license. It is a five year license and when you are somewhere in the middle of the woods crashed your mountain bike and break a leg you'd wish you had spent the extra money for the 5 mile range GMRS band radio.Let me tell you it happened to me!!!!!!"
4,"Nice Radio, Worth the extra money","As a ham radio operator, I've seen enough radio's to know whether it's performance is good or not. These Motorola's perform very well, the extra power w/the 5 watts really helps; esp. in the moutains hunting etc. Small, stylish, but I think they should have made these weather proofed."
3,Nice re-usable filter IF it fits,"I'm not sure if I received the correct product or not, but it was an impossible fit without making modifications to the filter or filter box. I ended up re-conforming/bending the filter upward (finally looking like a trapezoid from the side) to get it installed. It still seals up well against the housing with the nice and squishy foam gasket, but it was hardly worth the work and cussing to get it installed. It might be easier to buy all foam filters at a fraction of the cost for a 2 minute installation every so often instead of having a headache every time you need to pull it out, clean, recharge, and reinstall this one."
5,Old Product does the trick!,"My dermatologist insisted I start using Albolene to remove my eye make-up due to bad allergic reactions to many products. My Mother used to use this stuff. i was surprised at how easily and gently the make-up comes off. Yes, it has a slight greasy feel but nothing burns my eyes and the tiniest amount does the job. Another factor, I have started using it all over my face along with a baby wipe and it takes seconds to remove all traces of make-up, plus your face feels very nice and smooth. Try it you will find your skin feels great. It can be used on babies, children and I even cleaned some goopy stuff off my dog!"
2,warped - thin plastic,"I paid about $45 for this item in total. I looked at it an noticed the door was warped and it was made of cheap plastic less as thick as a dime. The door would not close correctly, I was missing screws in some places on the hinges, very poor quality. It looks like a machine stamped it out for about $0.25 cents. Since the door was warped and damaged and it made the mirror warped, Amazon accepted the return for a refund. Thank You, Amazon."
3,beautiful song 2 good remixes,"Whenever I say your name is a beautiful duet, with soul, power and love! The remixes add a little diversity. I like the last mix (Billy Mann)."
2,"What you see, is not always What you Get !","Did not get the same color scheme/pattern as shown in the picture.Instead, it was more Vomit & Poop colored; making for a muddled, and an almost embarassing image.I will not wear it, so it is useless to Me.Contacted the Company, and asked if I could exchange it, as long as I paid the Shipping ,and got no response; except for : ""Make sure you leave us Positive Feedback.""Yeah sure...get right on that...just like you got right busy on my Customer Satisfaction. NOT !Now I guess it's up to Me to Re-Sell it on E-Bay or Craig's, and go buy something better.......FROM SOMEONE ELSE ! Live and Learn, Win Some, Lose Some, BUY WITH CAUTION !"
4,easy to install,This battery is so easy to install and very affordable; no need to request any technical assistance from monitoring company(e.g.Brinks).
4,It is a battery and works.,"My alarm system got toasted smell coming from the transformer. In case it went bad, I ordered both battery and transformer. However, the smell went away once the battery was placed, and transformer cools down quite a bit. Obviously a bad battery with 10+ years need to be replace to reduce fire hazard.There are actually cheaper ones with same part number and size. I selected this one just because it looks better."
4,its a battery,not sure about service yet but my home security system recognized it as a better battery than the old one and the trouble indicator light went out. mission accomplished.
5,Celtic Christmas,"This is one of the best instrumental Christmas albums I have ever had. Lifescapes usually comes up with some nice stuff and this album is no exception. It is wonderfully upbeat when it needs to be and quiet and soft when it should be. For me listening to the music with lyrics that play on the radio from October to December gets old very fast, but this album never seems to get old.The album is 50 min long, but still only one disk. So it is nice to be able to set it in the background and let it loop for that holiday atmosphere without beating people's nerves. I very much recommend this album if you enjoy Christmas music or even just traditional instrumental tracks with a Celtic flavor.Amazon does not seem to have any Mp3 tracks so if you want to hear the album go to the Seasonal-lifescape site, it's the album labeled ""Celtic Christmas"" with the castle on the cover (the angel isn't on the cover anymore I guess)"
1,This is total trash; do NOT waste your money...,"I bought this about two weeks ago, and I have yet to get it to work. I have two XPs, a 95 and two 98SEs and this sorry excuse for a peripheral cannot be read from ANY of these machines via USB. I even downloaded the latest driver from the lexar website. Actually, I say 'latest', but I should perhaps have said 'last'... for if you try and find this reader on their products page, it isn't to be found... why? Because it has been discontinued, that's why.God only knows if this thing EVER worked (certainly, there were +ve reviews available), but I can only give my recommendation to give this thing a W-I-D-E berth and to spend your cash on a better manufacturer instead. I am very disappointed... it wasn't very expensive, and I certainly did not buy the cheapest, but I expected better things from Lexar..."
2,It works - well sort of,If all you are looking for is a memory card reader so you don't have to connect your camera then this is it. However this reader is 3X SLOWER than the reader in my camera!!My Olympus 4000 is 3x faster downloading the pictures than this reader is.I'm using Win2k so there were no drivers to load for either device.
4,galaxy,"I have twins at home, 10 months old. I am 34. I do my best for their growth,i hope they both be a high positioned person in the future."
3,The manga and the anime.,"Well, since the DVD is coming out on October 12'th, (I am writing this on October ninth, mind you) Im not really sure abouy it. The Manga of Rave Master is very awesome though I would recommend to get the manga before watching the anime though, so you get what's really happening. I've also watched some of the anime on Cartoon Network.The anime is okay, but not some of the best that I've seen. But, if you ever noticed, this is Hiroshimas'(The creator of Rave Master) first anime and manga. The Manga is alot better than the anime though. But over all, the anime is pretty good too."
1,MOTHER'S GIFTS DISSAPOINTMENT,"I ORDERED TWO BOOKS FOR MY MOTHER FOR MOTHERS DAY THEY ARRIVED AT HER HOUSE SHE LOVED THEM I ORDERED ONE FOR MYSELF TO COETOMY HOME. I LOVED IT!! SHIPPED QUICKLY,PERFECT CON DITION (FROM A DIFFERANT SELLER) BOTH SELLERS WERE GREAT!! THEN I DEIDE TO ORDER ONES FOR MY OTHER CHILDREN TOTALING 5 BOOKS IN ALL I NEEDED. I FIND ONE AGAIN ON AMAZON PUSH QUANITY 3 THEY ONLY HAVE 1 SO I CHOOSE ANOTHER SELLER. WHEN I GET THE BOOK IT HAS SOMEONE ELSES INFO IN IT. THEY ALREADY FILLEDIT OUT!! VERY DISSAPOINTED IN SELLER. PRODUCT IS A BEAUTIFULBOOK, SELLER WAS THE ONLY BAD PART@!!To My Child: A Mother's JournalTo My Child: A Mother's Journal"
2,Not that clear of a picture,"As much as I wanted to just love this collection, the transfers appear to be off 2nd generation EP speed masters. It is not a pretty picture. On top of that, it appears they went to a medium resolution in order to fit 3 titles on each DVD.If you're just looking for a cheap monster DVD, this is your title. It's not like you're looking for HD action with a flying turtle."
2,Sub-par DVD release of classic films,"The rating applies to the quality of the DVDs, not the films themselves. While the films are the same poor quality fullscreen versions available elsewhere, the real problems is the excessive artifacting. The extras are meager but interesting, but still suffer from the same problems. I would only recommend this to a giant monster fan looking to quickly start a collection before upgrading. Only buy this cheaply."
4,Hard,"I tried this game,and I had tons of fun.I got really high on the levels but I got stuck on a level.If you are looking for a challenging game this is one"
3,frogger,Frogger is a fun game. The game is sometimes annoying when you have to start three screens back when you get squished.
4,A challenging game,"Frogger 2 has many different challlenges. There is ice you slip on, bumblebees that chase you, piranna fish that can bite you and even rolling barrels that could smash you.Your goal is to rescue lost baby frogs. The many different types of challenges make it fun."
4,Motocross,"This is a pretty fun game. There are many riders to choose from along with bikes. You can choose different race tracks and do short races, championships, and freestyle. The freestyle takes a little while to figure out how to do the moves. I would recommend this game if your a motocross fan."
1,"As Cher would say "" As If ""","So, hollywood makes a hit movie right? So then they make a tv show, and now a book? This book took the movie and what it had to say and turned it upsidedown. They took all the valley girl talk from the movie and tripled it! Here is the first paragraph... Charity is so fresh. My best friend ,Dionne, and I are totally into doing good for humanity. Like making it more attractive. They also use phrases from the movie, you know the ones like, ensembly challenged, and the word brutil way to much. Now they are giving a makeover to Mrs. Guiests student assistent. It gives the title clueless a whole new meaning! Even the back is inept, it starts out with, Charity begins in your own mansion, right? Do yourself a favor and skip it! I hope this has been helpful."
5,The Garden Primer,Excellent reference book. I will always keep and refer to the info in book. Very well layed out and simple coverage of everything needed to know to start a vege or regular garden. I had seen author on Martha Stewart and was impressed by her knowledge and the basicness of the book.
5,Perfect starter,"If you have never done any kind of gardening before, buy this book before you ever touch your ground. Not only is it helpful as a reference book, but the information is presented in a way that makes it a good read and fun to learn. If you have a garden, this is a must have. There might be better books on specific plants or topics, but there is no better all around gardening book."
5,An exceptional work,"Gardening books ... sigh.The number of gardening opinions that conflict with or contradict each other usually equals the number of gardening books you have in your library. Sometimes, plus -- I own a book on ""easy roses,"" bought on the cheap somewhere long forgotten, that manages to contradict itself on nearly every page. I thought it a great value -- so much confusion offered within one volume!Somehow, Ms. Damrosch's book offers an exception to that rule, and is the guide my wife and I rely on most. It is never out of date, always reliably practical.Sound advice delivered in a civilized and clear manner. You'll wish you lived down the road from her, just to lean across the fence to chat occasionally.We heartily recommend this book, even if you think you've gardened long enough to be above a primer."
3,Notice copyright date,"Based on the very positive reviews, I purchased this book, and started reading. I thought it a little odd that she mentioned mailorder companies 'beginning to use plastic', and I was taken aback in the section about mulches that the now ubiquitous bags of cedar mulch were not even mentioned. That's when I checked the copyright date. While much of the information is timeless, and the writing style is certainly entertaining, there are some dated items."
3,inscribed,Book was new as in not been read or used. However it was inscribed on the inside front cover to someone and love Grandma. This would have been nice to know before buying as it could have been a gift for someone. It was a purchase for myself so I will keep it but will ask next time.
5,excellent collection of stories,"My first Ellison book, and it was great! Contains the classic ""Repent, Harlequin! Said the Ticktockman"", and several others that aren't as well-known, but just as good. The story ""Paingod"" is very impressive. His stories come off with the elegance of Bradbury, but with a harder edge"
2,Not as advertised,"Let me get this out there right from the start - I LOVE Ellison! I have from the 70's and still do.BUT - The description of this ""book"" tells me that it contains 172 pages and the other reviews speak of the other stories in it other than Paingod. WELL . . . all I got in my Kindle ""delivery"" was the title short story - no book to speak of, certainly not 172 pages worth, no other stories at all.Perhaps I shouldn't gripe since I only spent 69 cents on it, but it simply wasn't what I ordered and wanted. I wanted the whole collection of stories but only got the one short story ""Paingod""."
2,Pain. PAIN. PAIN!!!,"There's a lot of pain in the world - or at least Ellison's part - and he wants to be sure you're well aware of it. It's not that these one-note stories are badly written, it's that they're baldly obvious. If you're not aware that pain exists or you just like to read about pain, maybe this collection will appeal to you. Or you could just stub your toe and achieve the same emotional depth Ellison does."
4,"Warm, but not quite right","The headband is pretty warm, but I noticed the bottom of the ears lifts up from my ears a bit, letting in the cold air. Overall, I am definitely warmer, but this would certainly be better if it completely covered my ears."
2,Size not listed,"Nice headband but since no size was listed in the ad, it was too large. I am an average sized woman with an average sized head. Headband marked ""6"" inside which was not on the ad. I had to give it to my husband. Guess I will have to find a ""kids"" size ""5""."
5,Toasty and warm,"If it isn't my hands, it's my ears that get cold and I always find myself pulling my caps down, stretching them to cover my ears, or I'm always searching for a scarf to tie around my neck and ears. The problem is I end up stretching my hat out of shape or over-heating under a scarf that now has half of my face and neck covered up. That's why this headband is perfect for me. It covers my ears, keeping them warm and toasty while allowing the rest of my face to be uncovered. the fit was perfect and if I want to pull a ski cap or beannie over my head I still can. I also had no problems hearing music through my headset with these on, they actually made them fit more tightly, giving the sound a deeper quality. Overall I am highly satisfied with this item."
4,"A step up from ""reinventing"", buy it","'big ben', do you really think it's fair to give a bad rating based on what you thought or heard the cd was 'going' to be like? Copeland and Sheerwood suck fat b@ll$, just like anberlin and all those other boring bands that tooth and nail sign, so the fact that TR don't sound like them is a big plus in my book. There are plenty of other bad soft-serve indie pop bands out there for which you are qualified to give good/bad ratings to, so stay away from pop-punk! You don't see me reviewing 'anadivine', now do you?"
2,So far so Good,Got a few months on this belt now & as as far as I can tell it is every bit as good as the Gates brand from Checker/O'Reilly - $10 less too. If we get several years out of it then I'll call it better than the Gates brand & on an even with the Ford (OEM) product & @ 1/3 the cost what a steal that would be. But let's not get carried away just yet. Bando & Amazon ROCK!Edit: 2/27/13 - starting to squeal already. Six months is not acceptable. Got @ least a year out of the Gates brand. Going to give Motocraft a shot.
4,Beautifully illustrated classic,"This well-known story is presented with stunning illustrations and easy to manage chapters. The vocabulary is accessible to younger readers, and the characters are clearly delineated. It is the type of book that can be read in parts without losing the focus of the main story. It is certainly one of the best presentations of the Arthur stories."
3,[Three and a half stars] Phil Simms is one of the top four QBs in Pro Football history!,"Phil Simms had the greatest game in SuperBowl history! A career New York Giant,they'll never have another one better!A decent video, too. To the NFL Hall-of-FAME!"
5,Super Bowl MVP,"I did not see this video, but Phil Simms rules the earth! 22-25 passing Super Bowl record"
2,cuisinart multiclad saucepot,I am not impressed with this product. It doesn't clean well and the bottom of the saucepot is spotted. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
1,Not a top line,"After checking out the reviews on this pot it told me it was not the one to get, after all you want it to last a lifetime and then some.I picked up the All clad 12 quart d5 stock pot at Williams-Sonoma today at the price of $334.95 regular price was over $400.00 20% off was a good deal on a pot that will last forever. And for some of you that get the cheap pots, good luck with the rust spots."
5,Induction compatible,Got this for my wife as her old stockpot would not work on our new induction cooktop. This works great and my wife was very pleased. She now wants the smaller stockpot also.
2,Quality is missing,"I bought this pot and a few others in the set as a cheaper alternative to my All-Clad set. After a few uses, I see a lot of corrosion around the rivets, and bottom of pot. I know stainless steel can't rust, but something is strange with these pots. Maybe it will come off with bar keepers friend or the like, but I don't have this problem with my All-Clad collection. I still use them, but perhaps they are not using 18/10 stainless, but rather a cheaper 18/0 or 18/8 stainless which are more susceptible to corrosion. After all, what's the quality control in china?"
3,Important Upgrade Available,"According to the specifications this product is only available for Windows 95, 98, or NT and supports just a few GPS devices. But it is based on the same program (Topo) used in National Geographic State Series, which is compatible with windows 2000, XP and 60+ GPS receivers. You only need the free Topo upgrade available at Nevertheless, TrailSmart series was created by scanning Trails Illustrated maps, so don't expect the quality of USGS maps found in the State Series. In my opinion trails don't have enough accuracy in this product (I tried Yellowstone)."
5,Best mapping software I have used,"This software really lived up to my expectaions. Functional, elegant, and easy-to-use. Great maps combined with great software. I highly recomend it. The best topo software out there"
1,Confused Production,"This film is very confusing. This movie is also terrible. As many reviewers have mentioned already the acting is horrid. They all seem to be reading from cards as if threatened at gunpoint. The pseudo-asian leader is rediculous. The effects are good enough but every scene seems to be shot with a still camera as though the actors are shooting in their own garages. And truely, the acting is par with that hypotheses. Think SciFi channel 1995.The trailer is truely the most entertaining part of this entire film's existence. The director needs to go back to being an accountant at the real estate firm. Because, alas, there are no redeeming qualities in either the direction or acting ability in this film. Perish the very idea of calling this a film really. It is a home-grown would-be non-viral fan-quality video that makes ""camcorders"" look good. Avoid all any cost. Even $7."
1,The worst movie I've ever seen - bar none,"This movie has not one redeeming quality. Not one. Terrible acting, awful storyline, laughable 'special effects' and even the music is awful.I wouldn't recommend buying this even if it was 10 cents. Not worth 10 seconds of anyone's time. Whoever directed it and filmed it should seriously be considering another career."
3,Get this after the first and the last albums by this band,"Why Amazon classifies this under antipodean ""music for travelers"" who knows? It's pretty much the same as this NZ band's previous and later albums: countrified rock with enough distortion in both the untutored male vocals and the feedback to offset the sweetness of the female voice and the softer songcraft. Great cover art, by the way: a frescoed androgynous face looking out of a spacesuit helmet, fitting the familiar-sounding landscape evoked here but with a desolate (if not methane-laden) aura to chill the listener into unsettling visions rather than comforting ones."
2,Product support lacking,This product works great with Mac OS 9 but is not compatible with OS X. This operating system has been available for over a year and other USB/CF readers are working - why won't Lexar release a driver for a current OS?
1,Works - But barely,"With my 98SE system I have constant crashes, wants to format the flash card, blue screen, etc. Power off and on, then it works again for a while. Reinstalled a few times, tried closing all other apps, doesn't seem to help. I am using the Canon CF card that came with my Canon G3. The CF card always works perfectly in my G3 no matter how much the reader says the card is bad. At this point, with the purple color and shiny cable, I plan on using it for a lure on the lake."
2,For Lexar USB Only?,"I have one of these readers that came with my Lexar 1GB USB CF Card, and it works GREAT with that card. I recently purchased a Sandisk Ultra II 1GB card -- I put this card in the reader and the light just stayed illuminated; nothing was being read. I then read on the Lexar site where it says the JumpShot readers are made ""specifically for Lexar CF Cards"". That really gripes me. I guess it came with the card, so I shouldn't complain, but for Pete's Sake... this is a simple device... make the thing universal!"
5,it works well,"I'm surprised this caused any computer to crash. It works great for me and seems like a pretty innocent peripheral. Mine plugged and played as advertised and I have had no problems with it. It is a cute purple color and it is see-through too. Basically it works fine, it's really cheap, and at least if you have Windows XP, you can just plug it in to a USB port and it works fine in my experience at least."
4,twice the fun,"i actually loved this dvd. getting vocal lessons from tim bogert, how cool is that? well if you're a vanilla fudge and jeff beck fan, and saw tim sing on stage, you'd know how cool that is. now the tim lessons are pretty much exactly the same as the the first teacher's, so that's where the twice the fun comes in. that is if you think vocal lessons are fun. if you've never had professional lessons this is definetly the dvd for you. i've had pro lessons in the deep dark past, and i found this dvd the exact thing i needed to get myself back on track for recording i'm doing."
3,Notre Musique is a very silly film,"Didn't the theater of the absurd project dissolve years ago? Jean-Luc Godard's Notre Musique is a reminder why Old Europe is in decline. The existential gobbledegook will most assuredly put any normal person to sleep. Was this film suppose to be about war? Wow, that is sure surprising. Ayn Rand would have had a field day criticizing this indulgence in anti-rationality. Why was Dante dragged into this mess? What did he ever do to Godard and his fellow radical leftists? This cinema journey does indeed start in hell and travels through Purgatory---but it never arrives in Heaven. We are obviously meant to suffer eternal damnation. The photography and the accompanying music are the only mildly redeeming aspects of this so-called cinema experience. Sarajevo is a gorgeous city. Alas, why did the actors have to open their mouths and spoil everything?"
1,a racist text,This is a racist text. Very little is going on here except typical racist rhetoric against european-americans. Not worth a read and certainly out of place in a time when everyone is being told to be multi-cultural.
1,Not worth reading,"An unbalanced, confused, confusing and even boring book. In the end you don't even know when or where the described actions are taking place. You buy the book trying to understand something of a conflict like this, and you should get more insight and order in the author's exposition. Besides, it is poorly written (at least the spanish translation). Very disappointing. Do not waste your money, there are several other better books on this shameful war."
4,A good primer on the War in Chechnya,"I came across the writing of Sebastian Smith in a New York Times Op-Ed piece and decided to look into what books he had written. Allah's Mountains is a well written book which goes through the conflict of Chechnya along with the regional conflicts which are sewn together to give the story of regional turmoil in the former USSR. It was amazing to read how the band of Chechan fighters held off the once proud Soviet forces using very simple tactics. On the other hand, Yeltsin does not come across as a very compelling figure and more of an embarrassment of leadership. For anybody looking to get insight into the Chechan war, Mr. Smith's book is a MUST READ. The only reason why it did not get five stars is because at points there is some repitition."
4,A fair and unbiased look at a war,"Nowadays its easy to go and scream Islamic Jihadi and radical Islamic militancy and terrorist, and the list goes on. Rarely do we find someone who leaves the blame game out of the situation, and actually looks at the situation with a fair and unbiased approach which then gives people a better understanding and not a twisted one, that is full of hate. The Chechynan cause has been a resistance against foriegn invasion and it will go down in history as so, we must not forget that the world isnt black and white, or as Mr. Bush puts it you are ""either with us or against us"". There are in between the lines things that must be known and this book gives us a great look into the Chechnyan Issue. A must read for anyone interested in history and current events."
1,"Interesting, but one-sided...","I agree with both Mr. Yin and Leonides. The premise of the book was good, but the book is heavily biased and ultimately unsatisfying if you are a serious student of this and related conflicts. The author admits that the Chenchens are proud, but somewhat thuggish, then goes on to praise how they cherish their knives while at the same time castigating the Russians for acting war-like. War is murderous and both sides in this book play at savagery. The author cannot praise one side and castigate the other - and contradicting himself on many pages - for the same characteristics; he loses all credibility.And, let us not forget that Chechens are supporting Al-Qaida and related extremist,Islamic groups."
3,a good handbook for married couples,"""Marriage and the Family"" is a book every married couple should own. With chapters like Before you Say ""I Do"" to Raising Teens, Bertha Davis examines it all. With cute stories from her own life, Davis take a look inside the American family and deals with some of their ups and downs. With great fact throughout the book, readers will start to understand what a huge responsibility they accepted and the impact they have on their children. An insightful handbook, consider including this in your next wedding present.Nubian Sistas Book Club www.geocities.com/nubiensistas"
5,Good for beginners,"This a a great game for young gameboy users or first-time users. My six-year old loves it. It is easy for him to understand and he caught on quickly. In the game you collect stars by doing different activities with Arthur. After collecting stars you get to go to an amusement park. Older kids would find this too babyish, but it's perfect for small ones."
5,Excellent first game for little ones,"I bought this as a first gameboy game for my son just before he turned 4. It kept him absolutely quiet for a 6 hour plane trip! It was easy for him to learn, varied enough to keep him interested, and didn't require complex maneuvering that might have frustrated him. I appreciate the way it involves no bad guys, shooting, violence and doesn't require an intimate understanding of a movie! After 6 months, my son still plays this game from time to time, but is now ready for something different."
4,An excellent theoretical perspective of drama education,"This book is a fantastic insight into a drama classroom. It is easy to read and full of practical examples of theoretical concepts. I wouldn't really recommend it for a teacher looking for classroom activities, but for teachers trying to make sense of their practice and broaden their view it is a fantastic read!"
5,The poet's life in his own beautiful prose,"Neruda's life highlighting the events that shaped his poetry and deep love for humanity. From his early childhood in his beloved and magical Chile through his experiences with love and politics, this beautiful and humorous book explores the poet's life in the most beautiful Spanish prose written in contemporary literature."
1,No Poems!,"Love these poems and wish I could get them for my Kindle, but for whatever reason the downloaded Kindle version only has the preface by Amy Lowell and the TOC, no poems. So even for free, downloading is worthless. I'm removing it from my kindle, so don't waste your time--if you want to read the preface it is available on the ""See inside this book"" on the book versions from Amazon."
3,Good game for alittle while but then gets boring,"This game is one of those games where you like it for a couple of hours or mabyee even days, but them drop the game and never play it again because it gets so boring and usless. You just want to get rid of them game and sell it one ebay or something just to get it away from you. I do on the other hand recomend it for the youngsters. They will like this game for a long time. When i say youngsters i mean seven years old and below."
5,A great show equals a great game!,"Ever since I was 6 years old, I loved watching Scooby Doo on TV. And now am 10 and I still enjoy it. So when I heard about the game, I bought it immediately. It was great! It was fun searching though 6 levels for clues and stuff. I like the game because its unique. Its a combination of adventure and mystery. You play as Fred, Daphne, Velma and my favorites Shaggy and Scoody. But enough. Am going to give you my personal opinion on Classic Creep Capers' graphics etc.Graphics: 8.0 {great} Nice and Solid!Sound: 7.0 {good} No voices but great soundtrack from the show.Frustration: 1.0 {great} Not frustrating at all!Controls: 7.5 {good} Nice and basic.Overall: 9.0 {wonderful} What is there to say?If your a Scooby Doo fan at the age of 7 or older, or just looking for something differant I recomend Classic Creep Capers. As Scooby would say, Scooby Dooby Doo!"
2,Too Hard for Kids!,My six year old found this game to be very frustrating and too hard. He also did not like having to switch back and forth between the characters.
1,frustrating for little kids,"My son wanted this because he is a big Scooby Doo fan, however, he was very disappointed with the game. The problem is that you have to be able to read and understand the clues given in order to play the game. He just started kindergarten and can not read yet. This may be a great game - I'm not sure. But if your child can not read then I would not recommend this game."
3,Not what I thought,"This game has great graphics and looks a lot like the classic cartoon. The only thing is you only solve one mystery, the one with Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, and its really easy. This would be great for kids, otherwise its too easy."
5,Readable and informative,"Although it might be a little bit dated now, this is still a very informative look of italian wines from central to southern Italy. It's also written in a no-nonsense but entartainment style."
2,For the novice independent sales professional,"Summary: This book provides a very generalized overview of 1) how to prepare a marketing plan, and 2) a variety of marketing tactics from advertising to sponsorship, the internet and sales strategies.Review: For the independent financial services sales rep that has very little background in marketing or sales this book may be useful. However, the book does not provide anything of value to a financial services firm of any size or any professional marketers. The book is not bad, but in my opinion (marketer working in financial services, 10+ years experience) it is really only of value to a novice independent sales professional who needs assistance with planning their own personal marketing activities. In fact, if I could make a recommendation to the authors it would be that the next version of the book should focus very specifically on just that."
2,Promises Much But Delivers Little,"This book attempts to be thoroughly comprehensive but ultimately fails because often some vital information is missing. I believe that health books which really empower are ones which give real, useable answers, not vague outlines. For instance, Mr Null does not tell me where to get the vital allergy tests done, what they cost, what they involve or which laboratorys/methods he recommends. He refers to these tests numerous times as providing part of the answer, but I am left feeling that I have a vague idea of the problem, but a wholly inadequate idea of the solution. Mr Null is NOT an allergy expert and it shows. The book is not completely useless, but my advice is to look elsewhere for help."
2,A bit short on content and a bit out of date,"While this book gives a nice overview of essentials in collecting paperweights, and some great information and pictures of the classic 19th century items as well as a useful glossary of terms used in Paperweight manufacture and design it is a bit thin on more contemporary items, selecting a number of artists who may have been known to the authors, but since the book is now over 25 years old, may not have much relevance to the collector of contemporary Paperweight artists who are currently in the collector's crosshairs, such as Dean Ebelhare, Josh Simpson, Caithness and Glass Eye Studio. All in all, a bit thin (108 pages total) for the price, but for a stunning display of classic designs by Clichy, St. Louis and Baccarat (the 19th Century master studios) as well as a decent if dated guide to pricing on these rarities, a good reference."
5,Great book,"This was well written, easy to read. If you want learn about Albert Pike as a whole person I recomend this book."
4,Albert Pike,"Good book about a man who had a great influence on the fraternity of Freemasonsry in the U.S. It should be ""must"" reading for all Masons."
5,A Must Own Album,"I heard this album-song back in 95 while going to college. It blew my mind a band could come up with such intricate symphony - That's what I would call the Paralyzed Mind of the Archangel Void. A reviewer said it was like being to space, and that's much like it when you play this on your headphones. It's not music to just hear in the background, it's music to appreciate, taste, and digest. I couldn't hold myself and bought the MP3 download as the album went MIA. Glad I did."
2,Frustrating when you get a bad screen,"Elite Screens R120WH1 ezFrame Fixed Projection Screen ( 120-Inch 16:9 AR)(CineWhite)I didn't order it on Amazon as they were out of stock for a short period of time. Got it from another authorized online retailer. Got the projector, screen and A/V wires installed by a professional. 2 days into the glory of 120 inches, I noticed 2 parallel bars (see uploaded images) on the picture that are distinctly visible on a white or light colored scene/background image. What was hardly noticeable for the first 2 days became an ordeal later on because all my attention was grabbed by those black bars. Called up the CC and they sent a new screen (not the frame etc) immediately. Now I have to go through the painful task of putting the replacement screen myself or shell out money for a professional job. I don't mind getting replacement for stuff but Projector Screen? Disappointing."
1,Measurements not accurate!,"We just received this screen today and started to put it together. After only putting the horizontal frames together, thought it looked too long....sure enough requires 110"" horizontally, not the 104"" stated in product dimensions. We had set aside 107"" which we thought would be plenty even if the frame wasn't included in the product dimensions. Now, I either have to send a very large package back or rip out new built in cabinetry. Very annoying and disappointing."
3,screen,"Compared to more expensive screens, this is a pretty good value. However, the screen's material is not perfect. Now, that I've started watching movies on it, I've noticed a few hot spots where the whites are very slightly different colors in certain spots of the screen. I'm particular about details, so it draws my eyes to these spots in especially bright scenes. I wish I had gone with a better quality screen. If you will be sitting far away and you don't look closely for fine details such as this, you probably won't notice it. But if small details like this bug you, you might consider a higher quality screen. If you're looking for a good bargain screen with fair quality, then consider this one."
5,Cool Screen,"I loved it... Good material, professional look....easy to assemble but took around two hours with two people and 2 kids (it was a family project).... only thing is that you should make sure that you have enough space for Screen... it is big for normal Home use.."
5,Fantastic screen!,"The screen arrived and the first thing I noticed was how well everything was packed. Then I took everything out of the box and thought everything looked good and instructions were straight forward. Putting it together was easy enough though installing the clips to stretch the screen was a bit of a pain at times but all in all everything went together well and once completed this screen is HUGE. Once mounted I was giggling like a school girl. Once the projector was going I saw an immediate improvement over my white wall, (which was being used for a few days.) I'm quite happy with this screen. The cost was a bit high but in the end worth every penny. The only thing that tops a 120"" screen is a bigger screen. :)I know there are better screens out there but at fivehundredplus dollars this is a fine choice."
5,Great screen for home theater,"If you have a theater room, I highly recommend going with a fixed frame screen like this. I paired this screen with my Mitsubishi HC4000 in a theater room with good light control. The picture is fantastic!Cine white vs. cine grey is going to depend on your projector and the room. My projector is DLP which generally gives you good contrast, so I went with cine white to get a little more brightness with the projector set at low lamp intensity levels.There's not much I can add to my review other than to agree with most of the comments in the other reviews I have read: assembly is easier with two people; the instructions could be better; it took us about an hour to assemble; the tension material makes a perfectly smooth surface for projection; it was extremely well packaged with the screen itself being protected in a very thick piece of PVC pipe."
4,Awesome screen! EZ install,"I'm incredibly happy with this screen. It was extremely easy to install. It took about 1.5 hours from opening the box to hanging the finished product on the wall. You do need 2 people when stretching the screen into place though. The screen looks great hanging on the wall, very professional looking. The big box stores all said that a grey screen would run a minimum of $1000-$1200. So I was pretty happy to find one for about half that price. I was a little skeptical about the quality prior to purchase, but after getting the screen I was very impressed. I've got an Epson 8350 paired with this screen, and the picture is very impressive! The velvet frame finishes the look off very nicely. My only complaint (and it's not a big one) is that on some screen shots, a little bit of bleed through shows up on 1 corner of the velvet screen. Only every now and then. All in all, I'm very happy & would definitely recommend this product."
1,Dissappointed,"I ordered the first Elite 92"" Screen. There was a defect in the product. The nail holes did not line up and the frame was warped on the right side causing the picture not to be clearReturned it and ordered a replacement: This one was slightly bend on the top part of the frame. I've learned to live with it but so dissatisfied with the product.I would not recommend this"
2,Rear Projection Only,I ordered this screen but had to return it because it is for rear projection only. Will not work for most media rooms with front projection.
4,Elite Screen has a nice frame and picture,"The elite screen has a very nice velvet covered frame and the picture off of the screen is very nice. I've only had the screen installed for a week but every thing that I have watched on it has been to exceptional quality level. My only issue with this that the dimension on the box and the dimensions as shown in Amazon, don't have the full dimensions including the frame which caused me some serious issue because my trim was desiged to match these measurement. Please go to the Elite Screen website to get the full dimensions of the product you are interested in prior to purchase. Overall, I'm satisified with this purchase"
4,great product for the price,The screen itself was a bit difficult to put together even when using the directions. Once the screen was together it mounted on the wall easy and looks great. The picture from my HD projector looks great as well. Great product for the price.
2,So NOT in keeping with the first books in the series,"The first several books in this series were amazing, wonderful, really creative. This one lagged in a lot of places, was confusing in some and just plain NOT a very good read. I bought it with high hopes, and got rid of it immediately afterwards, definitely NOT worth rereading. I sure hope the new one is back to her old style!"
5,A Quiet Knowing,Beautiful setting of many evocative spiritual classics. The artists understand the heart of the music and allow it to be revealed.
3,"intersting, but often obvious..where's the wisdom","This is an interesting book for a beginner, but many of the ideas are obvious to someone in the industry. I'd like to see more actual wisdom derived from actually user-testing sites. It's terrifying how many web design people just assume they know how ""good"" something is based on their exposure to design ideology, rather than doing some actual user testing. I'm not persuaded by many of the examples and I think the book tends to confuse visual design with information design and tends to ignore ""application design""... but then again, I come from an engineering mindset, so what am I allowed to say about ""design"". (i.e. book perpetuates the culture war between ""designers"" vs. ""engineers"", and tends to automatically favor the ""designers""...a tone I find regrettable)"
3,General Overview of Design Concepts,"This book featured a number of well developed web sites that were used as examples of what to do when laying out a design for a new web site. This is a good book for beginners without a design background, who are interested in learning some *basic* design concepts. This is definitely not the end all of design books, but a nice beginning introduction. The authors are down to earth with their tone and writing style. Very colorful, and very readable."
5,A must have for designers,"I read ""Click Here"" in one sitting, cover to cover. The author successfully integrates discussions on Photoshop, Director, BBedit, Illustrator as well as good solid design techniques. I highly recommend this book. It's one you'll refer to time and time again."
2,Just one question ...,"How can a book entitled ""Click Here"" claim to offer any wisdom on the nature of good web design? The message is flawed even before you turn to page one."
3,too bad the orchestra is not on par with Angela Hewitt,I was going to buy this and listened to excerpts. AH is great as usual but the orchestra is truly deadpan dull.So I'll hold off for now
5,Mourning Becomes Expensive,"Jessica Mitford leaves no headstone unturned in this exploration of the American funeral industry. Not only is it interesting as a study of funeral practices, but it also offers insights into business psychology, marketing, and sociology. Mitford's style is piercing and humorous (the chapter about emblaming often made me laugh out loud) while remaining very respectful of the deceased and their loved ones. Classics are never out of date -- and The American Way of Death is a classic."
2,what happened here?????,"I cannot believe I spent over $20 for this book. It is the first book I ever had that came with a list of typographical errors. This is unacceptable, the publisher should take it back and rewrite those pages with the errors."
4,Intriguing and entertaining collection,"This is a CD for someone who is already a Mountain Goats fan. More casual listeners would be better served by getting Sweden, 9 Black Poppies, or Full Force Galesburg. As a compilation of rarities, it is obviously rough and doesn't hang together like a typical Mountain Goats CD. That said, there are some great songs on this CD, from the opening song, ""Golden Boy,"" which are about peanuts, to ""Going to Port Washington,"" ""The Anglo-Saxons"", and ""Noticifer Birmingham."" Many of these songs are just Darnielle having a lot of fun. Sometimes, like on ""Golden Boy"", the results are amazing. Sometimes it only reminds you of how good he can be when he gets more serious. Overall, a good CD and a must-have for Mountain Goats fans."
3,umm,"It's very passionate about the lifestyle. The images are ok but too many of them are wasted on people. What i want to see is the FOOD. The book is a little crazy, it would be more successful if it was made at least a little more accessible, you know like some reference to foods that normal people are familiar with. (and i've chomped my way around plenty of CSA root surprises)."
4,A good resource for teens and adults,"I thought that the forward by the authors was delightful and heartfelt. I hope that they are able to reach teens around the world with their message of how raw foods can change your body, mind and life. Most recipes are easy to prepare, and the ones that I have tried so far are tasty. One thing that I would have liked to have seen was a description of what one needs to prepare the kitchen for raw food preparation. For example; I had NO idea what a Vita-mixer was, or what to look for in a dehydrator or juicer. These items are must-haves in a ""raw"" kitchen. Other than that, it's a good book to have."
5,Two Forks Up!,"This book gets the living foods award of Two Forks Up!Written with the honesty and aliveness of today's youth, Eating Without Heating, is filled with simple recipes that will inspire and guide the transitioning rawfooder and please the palate of the gourmet living foods chef. Sergei and Valya offer their story and wisdom to inspire people of all ages to join this lifestyle of health, simplicity and vitality."
3,It's ok,"This is one of the first books I've bought abot raw foodism years ago when I decided to give it a try and I can honestly say that its the only Boutenko book with good recipes, the cake with walnuts and honey in particular is delicious, but raw foodism is based on bad science so I'm giving 3 stars for the recipes only."
5,An Everyday UN Cookbook,"I have had this book now for about 6 months and I refer to it all of the time. I am not 100% raw, but about 75%. The recipes are simple, easy and straight forward, yet creative. This book has great ideas for a simple meal or for entertaining. Also, I really like that a lot of the recipes do not contain nuts, which are good in small quanties but a lot of raw food recipes are packed with nuts! I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
5,Standard Great White Stripes,"The album version of Hotel Yorba plus a performance at Hotel Yorba. Rated X is a nice song about our double standards about women who get divorced and try to have fun afterwards. When the song's over, Jack says ""Let 'em talk, Meg."" Hmmm, inspired by their own divorce? Maybe. The live version of Hotel Yorba is a different sound with Meg singing back up on the chorus. This is a fun EP to own."
1,Dealing with a new fuse architecture is bad enough,"Ordering these ""new"" style fuses one at a time is borderline insane. Someone at Amazon should check into this and offer an assortment of 6 or 10 or 12 at a discount. I'd pay it in a heartbeat, but I'm not going to order 'em one at a time.And I'll bet you won't either."
4,Nice Product,Fast and reliable. Very simple and intuitive product. Our only complaint is that occasionally the computer won't recognize it and we have to unplug it and replug it on our Windows 98 SE PC.
2,Windows XP cannot find the driver for it!,"I followed the instructions and Windows XP is unable to find a driver for the USB Memory Stick. I called their support, nobody answered. I tried their IM Live support, and nobody is home.The same thing occurs on two separate Windows XP systems, both detect the USB Memory Stick hardware and both claim not to find a driver for it.Finally, Lexar support e-mailed me back (they never returned my phone call as promised) and pointed me to an FTP site with an updated driver for Windows XP (not reachable via their web pages). Now it works. (I own a previous revision reader I had bought that claims not to support Windows XP and it works too now, so I didn't even need to buy this updated revision.)"
1,Won't work for Memory Stick Pro,"I bought this product to use with my 512MB Lexar Memory Stick PRO. Unfortunately, my XP Professional computer wouldn't recognize it. I contacted Lexar tech support, and at least they were honest enough to say it wouldn't work with the PRO versions. They recommended the Lexar Multi-Card Reader 2.0, which they said could read memory stick PROs up to 1GB."
3,Worked great....,"...with Windows ME, but not at all with Windows XP. A search of the manufacturer's website uncovered no new driver either. ..."
3,Cheap connection,"The part that pushes into the existing cooler line to the radiator is cheaply made. Once I connected it all, it leaked real bad. Luckily I was able to salvage some parts from my old one to make this one work properly.After comparing the inside parts to each other, you can differently tell the difference between the two in the o-rings and snap connector."
4,One of the best figures in the Episode III toyline!,"This incarnation of Anakin Skywalker is one of the best renditions of the character ever since he was introduced to the Star Wars saga years ago.Actually, this toy is two figures in one. The torso can be fitted with different limbs and heads to recreate the looks of Anakin before and after the duel against his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi.This is definetly no toy for kids, as the ""burnt"" version of Anakin looks gruesome and horrid. Collectors will love the figure, though -- its sculpting is just great and it recreates one of the defining moments in the life of young Anakin Skywalker."
4,sweetest bow ring,"This ring is very nice, seems to be very good quality. Very smooth and flush w/ finger. Nothing sticks up to snag things. I also bought sterling silver bow ring sold thru amazon, that ring is very sweet too, but ring tails stick up a little and i catch on things. I was afraid i'd scratch my toddler with it and i really wanted a ring i can wear all the time. This one is perfect. I think i'll give the other one to my niece since its very nice. I'm really glad to give this ring a try. Its sweet and feminine. I gave it 4 stars because i find it to not be true to size. I decided to get a bigger size than normal so i could wear on middle finger. Glad i did. My right hand finger size is slightly bigger than my left. So size 8 will probably fit my right hand ring finger well during summer months when my fingers swell a lil, a 7 would never of fit. And the 8 does fit one of my middle fingers. I love bow jewelry and this ring is great & great price."
4,Buy It,"If you are an old mystery movie fan,you will love these movies.Also have the"" Falcon "" movies which are also great"
4,Sophisticated Saunders,These are fun and its a peek at old decades we didn't live through.A great series if you like sauve detectives.
4,Great bag,"I bought this bag for my son's ""spy computer."" He loves to carry it, because it's cool looking, and it's very durable. The only thing I wish it had was a couple pockets for the little USB accessories he has for his computer. All-around good bag, though."
4,fun bath toy,We bought this toy because it was reviewed on heatlthytoys.com and is chemical and toxin free. Very well made and floats in the tub great. Our baby likes to chew on the green frog
2,Not for the beginner,"I was not happy with this workout, which was disappointing because it was more expensive than most DVDs. I found it difficult to follow, especially where many of the positions were at an angle that I could not see the TV screen. And personally, I didn't care for the very serious tone of the DVD. The Yoga language was all a bit much for me. And I felt that the same combination was done over and over again. This DVD would be better suited for someone with at least some yoga background and someone who is very serious about getting into the practice of yoga. I guess I was looking more for something that just focused on stretching and lengthening with a bit of Yoga mixed in. Karen Voight's Yoga Sculpt was more what I was looking for."
3,Very challenging,"I got this video to help with the postpartum bulge and I really find it too hard. I appreciate that it takes the time to explain form, but even with that then I found it very difficult to actually follow through on the form. My husband was watching me nearby and even when I thought I had good form then I apparently did not. Perhaps this video is best suited for someone in really good shape that wants to incorporate different types of exercise."
5,Exquisitely unpretentious,"Skilled guitar work and engaging vocals, all without the slightest bit of ego. It gets better every time you play it. Wonderful, wonderful stuff."
3,Eclectic.,"I didn't rate this 3 stars because of the performance of the music, but rather as my reaction to the music. It is not necessarily bad music, but just not my cup of tea. I bought the disc for the song ""Skinny"" which I remember from the days of my youth, and which WMMS used to use as part of its celebration of the arrival of Friday. The music is mostly folk/pop."
5,My Doll House,"This doll house has proven hours worth of fun and imagination. The furniture pieces are easy for little hands to maneuver, and the ""family"" members are flexible. There is enough room for a child to move things around, and the open floor plan allows for room changes.This doll house that is suitable for a child as young as three, yet it has an heirloom quality to it."
1,plastic plywood,This says it is a wooden dollhouse but is not worth the money - is cheesy looking and cheaply made!
2,Disappointed,"I have been very disappointed with this purchase. The furniture is not well made and easily falls apart. The dolls are weird and don't fit in the furniture well. The assembled house can not be moved without falling apart and simple play causes the roof and top back wall to fall off regularly. I spent a good deal of time picking a doll house and after reading ample reviews went with this one (I have noticed growth in the negative ones). I have regretted this purchase ever since. Absolutely not worth the money -- in my opinion this is very overpriced for the quality. The colors are cute and cheerful and the space is well designed for little hands, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this item. I am discouraged to say, I will be replacing it at Christmas."
2,Look but don't touch.,Within six months of owning this 50% of the furniture fell to pieces. Some wodd glue and a clamp will fix but for the price you should not have to make constant repairs. Save your money.
2,piece of junk,"Very cheaply made.MY children broke it after only four months.The back wall broke off along with the top roof.The furniture also broke.The people's hair came off.This house was a big mistake.I wish I had purchased a different one.This house is very cute,but not sturdy enough for preschoolers."
1,Dumbo Land Is THIS!,What A waste of monee. I do not think this is a nice gift for anyone. Boo.THE END
2,"Helpful info, but bad message too","I will say that the majority of this book is good. It includes helpful information on the preparation for surgery and gives parents and kids an idea of what to expect. However, the part of the story where the other kids don't want to play with Chris at school is absolutely ridiculous! There are several children in my kids classes who have had ear tubes, and you would never know it. Kids who need tubes do not always shout, and are most likely indistinguishable from the other kids. This message can hurt a child's self-esteem and make them feel inadequate, and YES, question whether anyone wants to play with them! I give the book a thumbs down. I can't believe that the author could ever think, let alone write something like that in a book that should be helpful to the child!"
2,read product description carefully,"Cover shows Basil Rathbone but only one of the three disks are Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce movies. The others are older, sometimes poor quality, and greatly altered ""versions"" of Conan Doyle's stories."
1,Don't purchase this one!,"Don't buy this one, especially if you are a Basil fan as I am. Only one of the disks contains Rathbone and Bruce, and these episodes are very poor quality. I am a Holmes fan and have several duplicate DVD from other sources. I have examined the video quality of this set against other sets I have and these were substantially much poorer quality. I placed this DVD box set in my ""give away"" pile!"
1,Misleading,"I honestly thought that Basil Rathbone would play the lead character and was disappointed to find out that he is only in a couple of the 10 movies. The pre-Basil Rathbone stories were true to Arthur Conan Doyle, but the quality of the film used was inferior."
1,Sherlock Holmes,When I received this video the quality was so poor my classroom students and I could not watch it. The movie screen kept moving asif it was a pirated copy?????? I am please that I did receive my money back and I appreciate that. I did buy a newer copy from Amazon and that copy was a good copy. I was disappointed because the story we read as a class was on the 10 movie DVD's but was toopoor to watch. Thank you again for my refund.Mary Ellen Weber
4,Very enjoyable journey!,"If you like Laura Ingalls Wilder and are interested in a ""peak"" at other adventures in their lives, this is a fun read. Otherwise, perhaps just a quick rental from your local library :)"
5,A truly informative book. Great ideas.,"This is a great resource book. It gives you new ideas by the page, these ideas can apply to just about any medium. Super!"
4,Great Start,"This is a good book for beginner and intermediate collage artists. It contains basic historical and theoretical information, as well as basic application techniques. You may also consider Nita Leland and Virginia Lee Williams' book CREATIVE COLLAGE TECHNIQUES. The techniques are challenging and open ended, so they truly encourage you to be creative."
5,Collage Techniques: A Guide for Artists and Illustrators,"Loaded with full-color examples of approaches and techniques. Instructions clearly written and illustrated with advice and hints on how to apply information to each person's individual artistic style. Nice pictorial review of many artists' collage examples. A very useful, hands-on, informative book with freedom for true individual artistic expression."
5,great resource,"Chock full of information and inspired art by many artists. In spite of what others have said, there are some how-tos in it. But if you need more basics, go to Nita Leland's ""Creative Collage Techniques"" as well as the many books published more recently on collage. This is a reference I'll return to over and over."
2,"Newer Techniques, Newer Books, More Info","Collage has changed over the past few years, mainly since the rise of digital media. This book focuses nearly entirely on physical collage with only a small section on computer based art in collage. I felt this book was extremely dated, especially in a genre that is all about ""sampling"". Skip this book and grab ""The Collage Workbook: How to Get Started and Stay Inspired"" for half this price!"
2,meh,"it's ok.......but these guys got waaaaaay better on all future releases. the sound here is more technical, which i generally like, but something just doesn't do it for me for this cd. the vocals are borderline terrible too. i mean, matt always screams so hard you can't tell what the hell is saying, but his vocals became much more powerful and refined on releases after this one. his later lyrics are much more powerfull as well. overall, i recommend getting the newest album or the 2 ep's before this one. in fact, get any converge album, hot damn by every time i die, miss machine by dillinger, we are the romans by botch, or until your heart stops by cave in before you get this for crazy, freakout hardcore. hell, i would recommend dozens of albums of many different genres before recommending this album. maybe i don't get this particular album, but this is medicore at best."
3,Robots Should Live,Robots are our friends. That is the message that I take away from this CD. I was hoping for more hypnotic sounds and less rah rah shah shah. but hey....i still danced and it does help enhance a big bowl of cereal.jack e. jettthe jack e. jett show
4,A good start,"Zen is not the pure, unadulterated form of Buddhism that most Western practitioners think it is. (Indeed, no tradition is ""pure,"" or divorced from its time or its culture.) In an easy-to-read style, Grigg brings to light the Taoist component of Zen. A weakness in Grigg's work is that all his citations are from secondary sources. Nevertheless, we can readily forgive Grigg for this shortcoming because his book is a good start for those who are questioning literal and dogmatic claims of unbroken lineages that supposedly go back to Shakyamuni Buddha himself, and who are ready to explore the social, cultural and gender contexts in which those claims have been made."
5,Finger Points at Moon,"Grigg's book offers one of the most comprehensively insightful treatments of both Taoism and Zen that I've encountered in many years. He makes a good case for the historically Taoist nature of Zen and then analyzes all of the principal qualities of traditional Chinese Quietism such as Nothingness, Simplicity, Balance, Suchness, etc. Grigg's writing style is smooth and transparent--enjoyable reading despite the subtlety and complexity of the subject. If you are a student of either Zen or Taoism and are looking for a leg up in understanding the essentially paradoxical, Grigg's book will take you far."
4,"Practical, warm and witty","Kooser's book is aimed at the beginning poet, but anyone could pick up useful ideas about revision, metaphor and simile, and imagining an audience. Kooser's writing is warm and often funny, and his advice is realistic and practical. This is not a book to read if you're looking for a quick way to become a famous poet. But if you're interested in putting in the necessary hours (and hours and hours and hours) needed to turn out respectable writing, Kooser can help you use your time more productively and enjoyably.Recommended."
5,Poetry,I continue to enjoy this book and have found it useful even though I am a published poet and author.
5,Begginer's Guide to Poetry,"Ted Kooser is the Poet Laureate, a professor of poetry, but he is funny, unpredictable, dow to earth as a writer. The Poetry Home Repair Manual is worthy of a slow, read, like sipping a glass of fine wine by candlelight with a lover."
5,Advice from Poet Laureate,"At first I thought this book seemed too casual and maybe a touch simple in its advice, but the more I read, the more I realized that Kooser was getting to the heart of poetry: to saying what you want to say so that it speaks to you and to others. The book is subtitled ""Practical Advice for Beginning Poets,"" but I think intermediate poets and poetry teachers can benefit from this down-to-earth approach, too. I particularly love the chapter entitled ""Can You Read Your Poem through Your Poem?"" in which he talks about poetic choices and how some choices block the reader from entering the poem. I highly recommended this book not so much for anything doing with poetic technique, but for speaking the truth about the attitudes and perceptions and skills a poet must have in order to write accessible poetry."
1,Don't - just don't,Abysmal. Neither recognisable as Miss Saigon OR anything else. Thankfully Amazon have put some samples up for you to make up your own mind.
2,Review of Guitar,"My son wanted a green electric guitar for Christmas, but didn't tell anyone until he told Santa a week before Christmas. I ordered one from this website and a blue guitar was delivered instead. He was so disappointed he won't even try to play the blue one. So, what I've learned from this is if color really matters, don't order it online!!!!!!!"
5,Classic,I love this so much more than Snoopy the Musical and more than the Broadway version. The last song in Snoopy the Musical Just One Person always makes me sad but in this special the last song Happiness always makes me happy. I love the songs but I only wish I could find the music for the TV special and not the Broadway version. My favorite is the Home on the Range song when everyone is yelling at each other it's so funny to watch. I think Robert Towers does a great Snoopy voice. Great special and I really enjoy it. I have it on video but it's not a good picture. I can't wait to get in on DVD 1/26/10.
3,good classic peanuts but my least favorite of them,good classic peanuts ..but all but one of the songs was terrible..i was a bit board with it..but still a must for all peanuts who want it all..the animation is still great though..
3,not exactly what I was thought it was,I wish I had the other Charlie Browns movie... I think my kids like it though. If I could get the Christmas and other ones I would like the whole collection.
1,Very Disappointed,The Wila Ergonomic Slotted/Phillips Screw Divers are of poor quality and are way over priced. Get some made in China for under $5.00
4,Ambience to indulge your mind,"Sonic Boom is guilty of releasing anything that springs from his mind. Many of his post-Spacemen 3 efforts have been true of this. However, his ambient leanings are superb, as is this disc. Unlike other Sonic reated material, there is the perfect amount of what we want (""The Calm Before"", ""Dusk"") and less pointless noodling that permeates the later EAR release Data Rape. If you like this album check out EAR's Koner Experiment too."
2,safety chains,"Nothing to reveiw, the order was incorrectly filled, only one end hook was shipped instead of the safety chain assembly in the description. The part I did receive looks well made and suitable for use at the end of a safety chain."
2,Dissapointed. DVD with no video.,"I was quick to open the package and insert it in my DVD player to enjoy the show at hand only to find it is only an audio version of the show. The only reason I watch MTV Unplugged is to watch the ""Unplugged"" version of a band and this along with the Unplugged audio version truely gages a band as compared to one that needs a lot of behind the scenes help. Note the audio is great but what a dissapointment to find no video of the actual MTV Unplugged show.I would have rather purchased the CD for half the cost if I was only getting audio."
3,A Great Half-Album!,"Long before this CD was re-issued, I stumbled on a used cassette and later vinyl LP of the album. I was impressed by the melodic nature of the material, and missed songs like these in today's music scene. I remember the title track getting some decent airplay back in 1983, and I like the video as well. Having said that, I found that ""side one"" is far superior to ""side two"" (still thinking in those terms thanks to the medium). ""Jackie Don't Go"" is my favorite, and shares all the qualities that make Journey so great. It is funny how you can hear Kevin Cronin's distinctive voice (REO Speedwagon) singing the background vocals in the bridge of ""Jackie"". If side 2 was stronger, this would be good competition for the amazing ""Vital Signs"" and ""When Seconds Count"" -both equally superb!"
5,break out the guitars,"the best thing about this album is the guitar work. produced by frankie himself, it has a much more melodic feel with a deeper darker sound. ""half-life"" has one of the best guitar solos i have ever heard. the album received little attention due to the bands inability to travel.(see liner notes on ultimate survivor collection) as a fan who has every album, this one is the best."
5,One of the most Under-rated CD's from the 1980's,"Great CD. Should be in any serious AOR/Arena Rock collection. This one fell between the cracks somehow, and was overlooked by radio & MTV (they were too busy with all those really terrible one hit wonders and trashy littel dance-pop acts that made pop music 1980's so disposable, I guess).Anyhow, hard-core fans of Survivor probably have this, but the rest not know what they missed."
3,"""Sparse"" Sound","This album is ok but suffers from a ""sparse"" sound, as if the bass player decided to sit this one out and the drummer decided to do the bare minimum. Why is there no bass line to any of these songs? It's not a bad album, but is a bit 'bare bones' for me."
2,Fair Overview,"The book is a fair overview of foreing exchange risk with lots of formulas. I couldn't find much on ""advanced strategies for global corporations."" For example, less than two pages are used to discuss zero-premium collar programs. It might be OK for new global investors but it's got very little for corporate treasurers."
4,"Gorgeous, heavy piece","This is one of the most elegant covered cake stands I've seen. It's well-proportioned, unlike many other cake plates that look almost squat. The crystal is quite heavy, and the dome rings like a bell when it's lifted off the base. And it arrived intact, thanks to very well-cushioned packaging.There are a few tiny bubbles visible in the thick crystal, and the seams are not terribly hard to find--the flaws are slight, though.I wasn't able to find detailed dimensions for this piece when I was shopping for a cake plate, so here they are: the interior diameter of the dome is 10.25 inches; and the maximum cake height is about 4 inches, although berries or something could definitely be piled on top.A lovely piece to enhance the presentation of cakes."
3,caution,"I've had HP printers for 20 years. This one looks the best of the bunch, but I caution you about one aspect of performance: It is extremely noisy, as the print head is very close to the front of the unit, and whirs back and forth to great distraction when it gears up for a print job, while it is performing it, and for a few moments after the job, as the head repositions or ""parks"" itself. I was quite disappointed. The build quality of this machine is distinctly lower than that of HP printers of past years (my last one dated to about 2001). On the plus side, it scans well, and has a nice console through which the user interfaces with the machine. I would be interested to know if the equivalent Canon all-in-one with similar form factor is as noisy as this unit. If you are in the market, try to find out."
1,Software Issues,"After owning this printer for 6 months, I am ready to throw it. The software that came in the box never loaded properly after 5 attempts. Trips to the website and calls to HP (very friendly but did not solve anything)were useless. It was agreed that it may be corrupted software. I have downloaded new drivers from the HP website on 2 different pcs. After working fine for a few days, problems arose again. You would think an HP printer would work seamlessly on an HP machine. I am a busy man and have no more time to waste"
1,OVER PRICED,WHEN I BOUGHT THIS HP 5610 NEW I PAID $99.95 FOR IT AT THIS PRICE IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY VERY SLOW BUT RELIABLE. HOW THERE CHARGING ALMOST 2 1/2 TIMES FOR IT NOW IS IS UNBELIEVEABLE AND NOT WORTH THE MONEY
3,Not what I expected,"This game is a great multiplayer game. The graphics are OK but the wrestlers look like they just fell off a five story building.This game only has two modes. If you are not good at it, this game gets extremely frustrating. The stadium is always the same and the controls stink. You can not use the analog thumb pad.If this game wasn't such a great multiplayer game, I propably would have given it only two stars.This is not a game I can reccomend but if you have siblings that like multiplayer wrestling games, maybe you should pick it up and try it out.I hope that this review was helpful to you."
2,DO NOT BUY! RENT!,This is not a very Good Wrestling Game...NO mercy for the N64 was the best..get that..This game is very dull...the controls are alright but a bit clunky..I though it was fun for about 1 hour..Very bad Dream Cast game...AND THERE ONLY WRESTLING GAME...But that doesn't really matter since Dream Cast has some of the Best Games ever made..This game just plain sucked...Don't buy it...Later...
2,WWF Dreamcast GARBAGE,"This game is garbage because of the few modes you can play and limited wrestlers. Sure it is good to get 9 wreslters into the ring at one time and it is kind of fun to fight in the parking lot near the street. But once you play it for a week or less, you get really tired of it. I suggest selling your Dreamcast and buying a PS2 or an XBOX which both have better (wrestling) games. Thats why dreamcast went broke. It had such good potential but the people did not put enough good games. Most were too much arcade like games that you got tired of. The rest was all sports. Well actually mostly all the games are better than dreamcast on the XBOX and PS2."
1,Royal Rumble is a half... rushed game by THQ,"Why THQ would even release this is beyond me. The player modelslook [bad] and the rest of the game is even worse. Only two game modes are available and neither is fun. In exhibition mode, you can't fight outside of the ring unless the game magically *whisks* you to and backstage area. The small roster is a big disappointment since very little work went into each of the wrestlers. Just IGNORE this game. ... END"
3,Weird set up,If your looking for a wrestling game where you get a lot of match options and characters and story modes and anything else commonly found in wrestling games this is NOT it. It is a lot of fun though and plays like the old mortal kombat and street fighter games with stages that get harder and harder but with fun team based game play and with the controls and physics of your average wrestling game
3,Wrestling games aren't the same anymore,"The graphics in this game are amazing. They look even better with the VGA box. That said, it leaves a bit to be desired. The Royal Rumble mode is a lot of fun. It kind of defeats the challenge though, when you can just get back in the ring every time you get knocked out with the press of the start button. However, the exhibition and vs. matches are another thing entirely. It seems as though you spend more time calling in your partner to help you out than you do trying to do it yourself. Although you may have ""one"" opponent, you're constantly battling a 2 on 1 match. Every time you hit your opponent, he calls in his partner to help him out. Even if you turn off interference, his partner still comes running in to the ring. 4 player exhibition modes make a great party game, albeit a button masher where you're mostly just throwing punches and kicks. If you have 3 friends to play with, I'd recommend it. Otherwise, leave it on the shelf."
3,Okay but it could have been better.,"This game is much better than the abhorid port of Attitude it still can't compare to the awesome Ps, and N64 Thq titles."
1,Can Be Described With One Word...Terrible,"I am not a WWF fan anymore, mainly because of this game! I foolishly bought this game with out renting it and wasted my money. You only get about 19 superstars and the entire game revolves around having 9 people in the ring at the same time. This game is one of the worst games i have ever played. I only started liking wrestling once i tried Wrestlemania 2000, which was good, and I no longer watch the WWF because of the lack of quality products."
1,fun for 5 minutes than boring,lets just get this straight when i bought royal rumble i was looking for the next smackdown.One problem it nothing like smackdown first of all there are only 2 modes a regular one on one match or a royal rumble where there can be 9 people in the ring at one time. Yes i know the royal rumble match sounds cool but it is as boring as a one on one match.In other words this game gets one star for being fun for 5 minutes.
4,Pretty fun game.... but only if....,"This game is extremely fun, there are a lot of characters to choose from (not as many as smackdown 2 just bring it, or raw is war for x-box, but still there are a lot.) The finishing moves are great, but the only problem is two things. ONe, it is way to easy to perform a finishing move, (you can be about 5 inches away fromthe guy and still perform it, 2, it is way to easy to build up your little ""bar,"" in order to perform a finishing move, and three, Triple H does NOT do a figure 4 leg lock, and five, when he does it his leg is going through the other guys leg. Come on, no wonder its rated teen for ""cartoon violence.""Over and all this game is pretty fun, but no where as good graphics, game play, and movement as Just bring it, or Raw Is War for X-box which is the best. OH, and for those people who look more aobut me ignore the review about Raw crashing. I got it fixed and now it works perfectly."
4,"could have more, but extremely fun nonetheless","Finally, a wrestling game for the DC that is fun. Those who are looking for an options filled wrestling sim will be disappointed but for those looking for a fun, fast paced game Royal Rumble will satisfy. The Royal Rumble mode is hectic but a blast to play. The main problem, and I'm sure this will pop up in every review posted, is that there are only 21 characters so the same characters will show up in the ring more than once. And in a related problem, why Edge and no Christian? Where are the Dudley Boys? With the ability to do tag team moves, it would have been awesome to give that shmuck X-Pac a 3-D. More modes would have been nice, too.But as it is Royal Rumble is an arcade game, and an extremely fun one at that. Having a partner outside the ring to help out adds a lot to the game. I like the powerup system, too. There is something very satisfying about getting that last 'S' and finishing off your opponent with the Rock Bottom. It's true, It's true!"
1,not a very good game,"Alright heres the story....I was looking for a good wrestling game for my dreamcast and I found Royal Rumble, it looked pretty good so I ordered it, when I got it there is only Royal Rumble-not very fun, Exhibition- ok, and a versus mode which is probably the funnest mode in the whole game. When I started to play royal rumble every superstar ganged up on me and they only tried to get me out. On exhibition when I would try to hit them they would spin around me and from there on I had no control over them and I could not get 1 hit off on them.And it is almost impossible to get your partner to help you. Also when you go to pin them you end up running across the ring. If you're looking for a fun game to just mess around with then this might be a good game for you, but if you want a championship winning, hard hitting action type game you will probably want to go for WWE Wrestlemania x8 on GC, or Smackdown: Shut your mouth on PS2."
4,wwf royal rumble very fun,wwf royal rumble is very fun for the whole family. what makes this game better then the others is that you are not limited to only 4 men in the ring at one time. you can go up to 9 men at a time!!
3,Good game. But wheres the modes.,"Royal Rumble is a good game. If you dont mind only having 2 player matches, arcade and royal rumble modes. The graphics are great and it has some of the best gameplay ever to grace a wrestling game. If you dont mind taking a risk you can get this. But probably only worth a rental."
1,NOT FOR MAC.,Ordered this because I was looking for a fast photo editor for my Mac and loved MGi's Photosuite 3 on my PC.Amazon lists Mac as an available operating system but when you get the box it is ONLY for Windows 95/98 or NT.
1,A Shoddy Manufacturing Embarrassment of a Belt,"I purchased this belt for a three year old. This belt is two-ply with a brown and black side (supposedly) glued together to form the finished belt. The plys are apparently bonded together with (just a little) spit and began to separate shortly after the first wearing. I am pretty ""crafty"" and will repair the belt with glue and maybe even stitch the edges with my heavy-duty sewing machine, but the original product, as delivered, is TOTAL CR@P and not worth the shipping fee, let alone the asking price. It received ONE star because I could not give it ZERO stars. Internet Caveat Emptor!"
1,"written pre-internet, so out-of-date","Copyright is 1993 and the data in the tables is from mid to late 1980s. Back then, people wrote books on word processors and went to bookstores to buy books. Not anymore. Buy a modern book on the subject instead of this one."
3,Not Very Good,I loved the music played while I watched this movie and so I rushed out and bought the soundtrack. For some bizarre reason they decided to only include a very few of the songs that actually stood out during the movie. They included a lot of songs you only heard 2 seconds of and never wanted to finish hearing.
5,Awesome CD!,"I love this Soundtrack and listen to it all the time. I was concerned that I wouldn't like it as much as I like Garden State or that it would remind me of how much I wanted to strangle Zach Braff's character in the movie... my worries were unfounded. I love it! Highly recommended! My fave songs include Paperweight, Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk, Star Mile, and Prophecy (boy is this one racey)."
4,The Last Kiss,"This album is more a collection of tracks that inspired the music behind the film rather than a direct soundtrack, but that in no way detracts from the great music on offer here. Zach Braff likes his acoustic 'sub-pop' style tunes and this album has them in spades. It manages to conjure up the general feeling of the film, as well as providing simply great songs. The variety of artists are pretty diverse and I was especially delighted to find Imogen Heaps 'Hide and Seek' here, which is a unique and emotional track. If you like the music from 'Garden State' it is a pretty safe bet you'll enjoy what is on offer here. This CD is well worth a look, you may even find some new artists you may not have tried before!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,The Last Kiss = An Amazing Musical Experience,"The Last Kiss soundtrack is great for anyone who wants to get to know some new artists. Zach Braff has great musical taste, and he showcases several talented musicians on this soundtrack. I would especially recommend this album to anyone who enjoyed the movie Garden State or its soundtrack. Many of the same artists from the Garden State soundtrack are featured here, making both albums equally great. There were definitely a few songs on the album that didn't appeal to me personally, but as a whole the soundtrack was pretty amazing."
5,trip down memory lane,"My dad got me this set for Christmas a few years back, and I always loved playing with it. After a while it was accidentally destroyed when the living room phone fell on it (we have wireless now :D). I used the pieces to create smaller ships, but always wanted to get this back. Now I'm ready to get a new one to rejoin where it left off."
5,Battle Group,"I wanted this set because it goes great with my Kittyhawk, Nimitz, and battleship sets."
5,Great condition,Nothing wrong with condition of DVD. Exactly what was wanted. The movie is also a great watch by the way.
2,Nothing to get excited about,"I didn't think this film was anything exceptional; it's basically just another sports movie except with a school-related side plot. Although this movie delivers a good message concerning education and physical goals, the movie is ruined by such factors as repetitive shooting styles (it always has to be either a swish or an alley oop), Coach Carter's unbelievably corny attempts at imitating a game show host, not-so-brilliant acting, and the fact that one of the basketball players never speaks throughout the entire film. The only aspects of Coach Carter that drove me away from a one-star rating were that the situations were fairly realistic, and also that I usually find watching basketball interesting. I would not recommend this film, except maybe to people who highly enjoy viewing basketball."
4,You owe me 2500 pushups and 1000 Suicides!,These are the movies where you know you will get the real deal. No Hollywood ending and no false impressions. Real life story of a Man... a Coach... a SIR! that takes it upon himself to help turnaround a team of young kids and turns then into MEN. A must see FAMILY movie to help people realize a lil something extra about sports these days. Show it to your kids.. your team.. your students. You will come out wanting to improve your own life. Basketball changes lives... may not be so obvious.. but after watching this movie you will see why.COACH CARTER!
3,"Overly Preachy, But Effective Drama!","Based on the true life story of a high school basketball coach in Richmond, California who wants his players to do better in life and on the basketball court. So muc so, that he bans his players from playing until their grades get better. It's a decision much to the chagrin of the parents and school board. The movie I felt tries too hard to tell the story and almost loses its punch. But with Samuel L. Jackson contining his great round of performances, as usual as the title role the film still is worthy of praise. Great for all kids 13 and up as they can use a lesson on priorities."
5,Great!,"Samuel Jackson is one of the best actors in the world. This film has a strong message. NEVER give up on your dreams! Coach Carter is the definition of ""focussed"" and is a man of principle, not afraid what the status quo will think of his methods. The ends here justify the means, and we are proud of his accomplisments at the end of the picture. All youth from ALL socioeconomic backgrounds will see great value in this excellent film. BRAVO!!"
5,A Real Life Inspiration,"This movie is about a team that goes from being mad to being normal and from always doing bad to always doing good. Coach Carter is about a basketball team that lives in a rough town and a rough high school. The Richmond Oilers had a really bad coach until the new coach Mr. Carter came around. Coach Carter used to go to the school and broke a bunch of records and knew a lot about basketball. Ever since Coach Carter started to coach, the team progressed and he lead the team to the state championships. This movie is very inspiring and I would give it four and a half out of five. This movie shows you that you can do anything if you believe in yourself. This movie is PG-13 so I would not recommend this to younger kids. This movie is also a true story so the movie always keeps you on your toes. Real \life"
4,very good story,"At first I thought Coach Carter was going to be another sports movie along the lines of the Mighty Ducks (but in a basketball version) but as the movie goes on, you find out the story it tells is actually pretty deep and has an important message behind it. The movie is not just about playing basketball and winning games, it's about getting yourself a good education before having fun playing sports. It's about realizing that basketball is a game you play for fun, while staying in school and learning is more important and more rewarding in the long run. The ending is the best part. I won't spoil it, though.Also, there's another message behind it. It's to respect the people who are trying their best to help you. That's what I got out of the movie."
2,Love Samuel L. Jackson but not as Coach Carter,"Samuel L. Jackson seemed somewhat tame in this movie, yet still believable as a coach of a high school in a rough neighborhood. I thought it could have been a little shorter but the time but it's only 76 minutes. That's pretty short. If it was 90 to 120 minutes I guess I would have been as restless as a 6 year old at church. It's kind of dull."
2,Not impressed,"This movie is somewhat like Remember The Titans...It's safe and is 95% a feel good movie with some exceptions.. Italso shows signs of being stereotypical.. Good athletic black mentaking off to the burbs to hang out with all the white girls andthen go back to the dumb black women that always accepts themback.I couldn't seem to care for any of the characters that arein the movie. None of them had any personality and overalljust wasn't very interesting... And sorry, But Jacksondoesn't come off as a former basketball player in this one.Sorry, it it's just a poor mans Remember The Titans."
5,One of the best films of the year!,"I know that the title seems a bit cheesy, because EVERY movie has this stigma put on it at some point, no matter how the movie is...but...THIS movie is one of the best this year to date!! A lot of movies that are being put out have been done before, and just plain remakes...not this one! This is the story of Coach Carter and his 1999 basketball team from Richmond High, out of Richmond, CA. Although the kids are excelling in sports, they are lacking what the real world requires of them to get ahead...Coach Carter takes the team and turns the whole dynamics around...by doing the one thing that all educators of today and beyond should do...demand respect, and demand they do their utmost best...live up to thier true potential, and make something of themselves!!A moving story about the love of the game, and the love of academics...and the meaning of teamwork!!! Excellent...excellent movie...NOT to be missed!!!"
2,Not happy,"It said it was like new. The DVD came scratched and filthy dirty. The case was also broken, I was afraid I would not be able to see the movie."
5,Fantastic Album,"Doc Watson is without doubt one of the best guitarist in the world in the area of folk/bluegrass music. Above that, he is a genuine lovable down to earth person and it is a real joy to hear him tell the stories on this album. I've been a Doc Watson fan since first hearing him play about 1973 and I never get tired of listening to his brilliant guitar playing or his wonderful vocals. A true American icon, I can't get enough of him. This ablum is truly special because of the interviews that seem to bring him into your living room. Love it!"
1,Can't even finish it!,"Received this book from my good friend who warned me ""It's a little pinchy(bitchy), but there MAY be some good ideas."" Well, I opened it last night, starting reading and after 29 pages I was so depressed I went to bed. I agree with so many of the other reviewers of this book. There is obiviously no joy in Elaine St.James' life. Along with the obivious ommission of the celebration of Christ's birth, the entire of idea of simplify comes straight down to eliminating everything that the season encompasses regardless of how commericalized it has become. I for one do not like to be told ""THIS is how we are celebrating Christmas this year...so don't get me anything. "" Fine that's how YOU are celebrating; NOT how I AM celebrating. This book made me ""hear"" that over and over again.This book will end up at the church's book sale; provided it does not burst into flames when it crosses the theshold."
4,easier holiday,"I enjoyed the book, it was very helpful to me. I have read 2 other of the authors books, and I agree with the other reviews that some of the book was recycled. But a lot of it was researched about how the holiday began, and alternatives to some of the traditions we have and why we have them. I agree that sending Christmas cards is bad for the eviroment and we could save a lot of trees, and money in stamps. Also why are we not using recycled wrapping paper, and why are we bothering to wrap gifts at all? Why not use news paper for kids if you have to wrap gifts? she has an entire section on Christmas for kids. I think this is a good book, and worth reading if you want to simplify your holiday. I love the portion on non traditonal Christmas and celebrating as other cultures do. Less focus on gifts and more focus on what we truly care about."
2,"Elaine, why do you still do Christmas at all?","Bah Humbug. Ummm...Elaine....if we follow all your suggestions, we'll wonder why we are bothering with Christmas at all. Skin it back to Dickensian proportions and let's all feel lucky we have a lump of coal for the fire and a skinny little goose for the family dinner.Lighten up, Elaine. I do like the suggestion of gifts that get used up rather than sit around forever, but otherwise, let all of us drive our wonderful consumerist economy with our endless spending on tacky Christmas stuff and overdone gifts. That way the people who produce the tacky Christmas stuff can live to see next Christmas."
1,"Some good points, but mostly annoying","I found the book annoying. Why? Because St. James recommends too many times that if you can't ""delegate"" to someone else Christmas chores associated with upholding certain Christmas traditions, just don't do them.Lots of contradictions in this book, too. In the chapter ""Remember What You Once Loved About the Holidays,"" she recalls ""The fresh scent of pine when we first brought the Christmas tree into the house."" Later on she devotes an entire chapter to ""Twelve Reasons to Skip the Tree.""And then there is the irony of paying money for a book that tells you to cut way back on your Christmas spending. There are a few good tips among the 100 ways St. James offers to ""Simplify your Christmas,"" but they aren't worth the price of this book.The bottom line is that, for adults, ""keeping Christmas"" involves a certain amount of money, effort and knowledge about Christmas history and traditions. St. James seems to want to skip it all."
3,Disappointing,"Three bestselling authors collaborate on an anthology but the result is a big letdown. Claudia Dain seems to have used teenflicks as inspiration for a story that's a bit immature for adult readers (I'd rather watch ""The Blair Witch Project"" again!) although Evelyn Rogers presents us with a thriller that's worth reading on the next dark and stormy night. It's hard to grab attention in a short story rather than a full length novel tho"
2,Uncertain if the River or the Book ran Backwards,"Unfortunately, this book's Title is a misnomer as it promises so much and goes backwards from there. It is as if the author were unsure - did he want to write about an historical period in time (1800 to say 1815), or about some very important events (the first steamboat down the Mississippi which just happened to coincide with one of the New Madrid Quakes), or about the not as important but certainly tawdry tale of a failed branch of the Jefferson family. It seems he chose to weave the tales together and, by doing so, did justice to none. He does explore some interesting historical events that coincided in time with the quakes, but fails to make any of the events real or meaningful, leaving the reader wondering why he bothered to write this ultimately superficial book."
2,A bit confused,"I would have liked to have given this book more than a two star rating. However, for those who wish to discover more about the New Madrid earthquake, you probably won't find it here. Somewhere between steamboats on the Mississippi, relations with local Indian tribes, and the War of 1812 the story of the quake is minimally told.A glaring error is found on page 227 where the author states that at the Battle of New Orleans the British troops fought with Wellington at Waterloo--a battle that occured six months later. This type of mistake is untenable in that it draws a conclusion within its assertion and suggests the possibility of other errors throughout the text.Readers of history would be better served by David McCullough or Joseph J. Ellis."
5,Great Investment!!,"I LOVE THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS! Having gotten that out of my system, I have to say I've hardly made a greater investment before. Whether you prefer to learn by Tabs or by musical notation, you'll love this book. It's great to have the actual music notes at your fingertips, rather than relying on Tabs websites guessing and checking to see if a version sounds correct. Furthermore, as an additional perk, the book comes with lyrics as well. It's just absolutely fantastic to have a book as accurate as this at your fingertips: every note, every tab, every lyric. I honestly couldn't ask for more."
2,Not realistic submisions,"I agree w some of the other reviewers here in that the book has decent wrestling and some good training for breathing, but the submissions wouldnt work against an actual trained grappler. The techniques are more flashy looking, and contain technical flaws. Im an MMA instructor and have trained in various grappling arts for years. I received this book as a gift, and decided to check it out. Although it does have some good basic info for a beginner, there are many other books out there that show much better, more realistic jiujitsu/submissions (Submission Grappling by Royler Gracie is one recommendation). Stick with the true basics, spend a little more money, and get another resource."
2,Not a useful book,"Even though this book is inexpensive, I was very disappointed. Most of the moves are not true submissions. The neck cranks and chokes that are shown don't seem like they would work even on the untrained. The straight and bent armlock are covered, but nothing you haven't seen before. Bottom line: this book is cheap, but it will just take up space and collect dust in your apartment."
3,It's huge!,I just got my dispenser today and I'm shocked at how big it is. It holds sixteen ounces and is 9 inches tall with an industrial size nozzle. I think it is way too big for my bathroom. It might look good in a barn. Other than that it appears to be a well made product.
3,one drawback,"The pump action is good, and it does hold a good bit of soap, but I notice after a few uses, somehow the bottom is soapy, so I have to put a folded paper towel under the unit to keep the counter dry...I had the same problem with another brand, thats why I got another one, same thing....use in kitchen, nice appearance though."
1,"POOR QUALITY, broken within a month","Nice design, but inferior quality. The nozzle broke off shortly after the other model with the caddy, which I bought for the kitchen. I originally thought it was just defective, but it's clearly of very poor quality since they're both broken in the same place. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
3,"Great, until...","I love the look of this soap dispenser, but after less than a month, the arm that extends out from the top of the pump started detaching from the base. It still works after being pushed back into place, but I wish this pump was more durable."
1,Broke quickly,"After only a few uses, the spout came off. We were able to put it back on but it came off again and again. Finally after only 3 months of use the spout won't stay on and the dispenser is useless. Too bad because it is nice looking."
2,Doesn't Hold Up,Because I liked how plain this dispenser is I bought another after the first quit working. After several months it stopped pumping the soap.
1,Leaks heavily,I loaded the dispenser with hand soap and found that it leaked heavily from the screw cap. Do not recommend this product.
1,Not So Good!,"I bought this for my kitchen. It looks great but it also leaks, and now the spout has broken off. What else can go wrong? I should have read the reviews first and looked elsewhere. This is definitely NOT worth the money!"
5,"So far, so good","At this point I consider myself to be a beginner. I know that this form of exercise is very good because I do feel more energetic, directed - and I feel that I can improve my health and energy level by doing my exercises. Thank you for this opportunity. I'm sure I'll have more to say a few months from now."
5,Definitely Five Stars,"My name is Henry Tsang. I am 73 yrs. old. I do walk and jog a lot. I play Tai Chi, Lok Tong Kuan and I like swim and golf. I don't drink and smoke, but I eat out very often. It seems like I don't have any bad habits. Unfortunatley, I still had a lot of health problems like allergies, sinus, arthritis, rheumatism, sore back, knees and stomach ache. My doctor couldn't heal me until I met up with Master Bond and I got the book The First 16 Secrets of Chi. The green diet chapter of the book taught me choose the right foods. The Feng Shui for the human body chapter that help me understand more about the best direction to face during my chi exercise. I highly recommend this book because it helps my problems. Thank You Master Bond."
5,"This book is a ""must"".","I was driving my granddaughter to school one morning and saw Master Bond's ""chi kung"" class in the park. I didn't know what it was then and stopped to see what was going on. Since everyone is welcome, I joined the group and immediately started to learn the correct way to breathe and do slow easy body movements with arms and legs.I think ""chi kung"" is perfect for everyone and especially for ""senior citizens"". It's very relaxing for mind, body and spirit. I feel uplifted and the world and life feels good.I use Master Bond's book ""The First 16 Secrets of CHI"" and find it very beneficial and best of all, very interesting. I like reviewing the many ""chi kung"" movements and the yin and yang that Master Bond teaches. In fact there is so much to absorb that having the book is a ""must"". And having it at my bedside whenever I want some relaxing reading is perfect."
5,A Guidebook,A very powerful story - The 1st 16 Secrets of CHI - a story of life. A way of life and a guide to a healthy lifestyle. Look forward to the next book.
5,I feel better,"Chi Kung is very new to me. I have been to 4 lessons and am halfway through reading ""The First 16 Secrets of CHI"". The book is very interesting, well-written and helping me considerably to understand the meaning and method of the chi kung movements. I am an absolute ""beginner"" at this but I am enjoying myself - I feel better - I feel good after the exercises - and I will continue learning."
5,attend classes & read The First 16 Secrets of Chi,"To maximize the true value of Tai-Chi exercise, I have bought this book & attend Master Luk Chun Bond classes twice each week & do 30 minutes of exercise all other days of the week. Believe me, this Book & Tai-Chi exercise go handinhand..My results are phenominal & tell everyone I meet each day, to get this Book & attend his Classes at Kapiolani Park. The first class I attended in 2002 on that night I had 8 hours of sleep. The next class the following day, on that night I had 8 hours of sleep. That is the beginning of the good results I've had since. Everybody who has any interest in betterment of their health must consider Tai Chi exercise & read this Book for guidance. Aloha from Honolulu.."
1,Terrible writing and ludicrous plot,This is exactly the type of romance that gives the genre a bad name. The writing is absolutely terrible. Nothing the characters do is believable. And the entire plot is based on the fact that people can't tell two twins apart. They manage to fool even their father and friends they've grown up with their whole life.The book is pretty much unreadable.
1,Lukewarm and not up to par,"This was definately not the Virginia Henley I was expecting.It took almost 300 pages for the character's to get together and when they did, it was quite unremarkable. The plot was superficial and almost predictable. If you like this author, buy some of her earlier works, ""The Marriage Prize"" and ""Desired"" are two very good earlier novels. I have read every novel Ms. Henley has written and this was quite dissapointing."
3,Nice but not up to par,"This is a nice little love story, but if you are expecting the same type of hot love scenes that can be found in ""The Dragon and the Jewel"" or any of Henley's older works, this is not the book for you. Most of the time the two main characters are apart and when they finally do ""get together"" the scene is somewhat hot, but more romantic than anything. If you are looking for a nice (if a bit goofy) love story, this is the book for you. Otherwise, try out her older stuff."
1,Great topic - Poorly Addressed,"I was looking for a resource on understanding lesbian ex relationships - the transition from partners to ""friends"", the impact the maintained relationship has on new partners, and suggestions on navigating this tumultuous territory. This book did not provide such information. It was instead a mix of poetry, commentary, and research. In fact much of it read like a journal entry- descriptive of an individual's experience ending a relationship with little insight into the overall trend and patterns."
4,Nice,"I've owned this for over 6 mo. and use it mostly for making tahini, minced beef, grate carrot. I bought it brand new, not reconditioned. There is absolutely no problem so far. Good power and easy to use. The heavy base keeps it from moving when it's doing its job. The size is perfect for 1 person. The only thing is the plastic bowl and lid is made of the kind of plastic seems a bit flemsy. (I haven't dropped it yet, but I doubt it'll survive a drop)."
4,Great Deal,"Processor arrived much quicker than estimated. Cosmetically perfect. Very quiet compared to the processor it is replacing. Would probably rate it even higher, but I really haven't used it yet! Very well made unit."
2,"More a Slusher, than Chopper","I have the Cobalt Blue, I am returning, 5 cup.It is not a good chopper, seems low power, and does not really chop, in my opinion.Perhaps I have a bad one, seems low power to me"
5,I use it ALL the time!,"I bought this reconditioned food processor for myself several years ago because I needed a good, inexpensive machine. My experience with processors up to that point was with my mother's (now 20-year-old) Cuisinart which I found heavy, clunky and difficult to clean, so I was reluctant to spend too much money on something similar.This KitchenAid exceeded all of my expectations! The base is heavy enough to keep it from walking away, but light enough that I don't dread taking it out of the cabinet. The parts mostly all fit together to store, so there's no digging for the right attachment, and there are very few crevices for food to get stuck in. Cleanup in the sink is a breeze; cleanup in the dishwasher is even easier. And this thing chops, shreds and purees like a pro!My only tiny complaint - I had considered buying a second bowl assembly, but the cost of buying the parts was more than I had paid for the entire machine originally."
3,Food proccessor works but directions a bit complicated,"This is a powerful and quiet machine but works only if the food to be processed is prepared carefully. Most of the soft items (meat, poultry, seafood, fruit, and cheese) must be hardened by refrigeration or partial freezing to be minced, chopped or grated. The feed tube must be filled and the blade right of the feed tube. Different pressure is needed for different food types, and some of the items may still remain in large pieces on top of the cutting disc. The blades are ""scalpel sharp"" and must be cleaned carefully and individually to avoid injury. It does not grind hard items (grains & spices) or liquefy fruits or vegetables, or slice hard boiled eggs. It does chop, slice, shred, mince, grate, puree, many food items and it makes bread & cracker crumbs."
3,A solid read but lacking by story's end.,"I usually enjoy reading Jillian Hart and her touching romances, but there was something missing when it came to the end of this book. It felt as though the ending was written in haste. The rest of the story was built up but then there was no culmination for the characters; the reader was never treated to their passion nor consumation of their love. Very disappointing."
3,Potential masterpiece messed up by pop-fiend producer!,"Y.O.Y.O.Y. is both the name of a song on NEXT POSITION PLEASE and the question I'd like producer Todd Rundgren to answer. Why, Todd, did you turn Rick Nielsen's famously nasty guitar down and slap a dumptruck load of schlack all over a batch of nifty Trick tunes??? Can't change the past, of course. But you can pick through the glossy production here and find some gems ... chiefly the title track. What a fabulous song! Sounds like a pop-metal meditation on reincarnation put across with tremendous energy. I CAN'T TAKE IT is another winner. The most maligned track is DANCIN' THE NIGHT AWAY, but it's a bum rap. DANCIN' is a rockin' tune played with winning conviction."
2,Rundgren dulls the Cheap Trick Shine,"As a long time Cheap Trick fan who has seen them 4 times in concert, this combination was a msitake. ""You Say Jump"" and ""I Can't Take It Alone"" epitomize the entire collection on this CD, should-have-been-Cheap-Trick-classics that were terribly underproduced, resulting in an AM radio sound. Rick, Robin, Tom, Bun: pull out those original recordings, produce it yourselves, and rerelease this should-have-been classic."
3,Next Producer Please,"Todd Rundgren's underproduction makes ""Next Position Please"" one of the oddest in the Cheap Trick catolog. This album has absolutely no zip! Some very strong Rick Nielsen songs are given a sound so thin, it's almost sterile. If there was one thing Cheap Trick was never meant to be, it was sterilized. And I may be one of the few men on the planet who thinks that the decision to cover The Motors' ""Dancing The Night Away"" was a good match for the band, even if the band swore they hated it. Too bad the whole thing sounds like it was meant to be played out of some tinny car AM radio.On an up note, the band liked the songs here so much that FIVE of the album's fourteen numbers made it to the ""Sex America Cheap Trick"" collection, so that may tell you just how good the songwriting for ""Next Position Please"" was. Maybe if this ever gets a remaster, the band will take the time to fatten up the sound."
1,you've got to be kidding!,"What are these guys trying to prove? That they can still play their instruments? That they still exist? The song writing on this album is virtually non-existent. The lyrics are typical Rush without the melodic wrapping. This album is really more of an experimental studio session that would have been better left in the studio. Sorry, folks, but as a Rush fan this was embarrassing."
5,Complex and Wonderful!,Most Rush Albums that I dislike upon the first few listenings are the ones I end up loving the most. This is one of those albums. There's so much going on musically with this CD that it's a virtual feast for the mind and senses. What's the story about Peart's tradegy? Haven't heard about it. It may shine some light on the lyrics of this album.EJC
4,"Ummm, well ... good, not great.","Since there are 350+ reviews, all I have to say is:* Is it just me, or does the production sound off/muddied?* In the same vein, Geddy's voice sounds buried most of the time* Lifeson is simply there ... nothing that stands outThat said, I do like the CD ... just wish the effort would have seemed a little more put-together over these last several years. Of course, Peart's sad family situation may have had a part.Anyway, 4 stars."
5,Soaring among the Vapor Trails,"I was wrong in my initial assessment of this album. After a solid week of listening (with my ""eq"" properly adjusted) I can honestly say that this is an excellent piece of work that the boys have put together. Ghost Rider is by far my favourite tune as well as Out of the Cradle. Neil's lyrics are the most open and personal that I believe he's ever written. The album does take a lot of time to ""get used to"" but I find it is well worth the effort!"
4,Not your same old Rush,"You truly have to give Vapor Trails a chance to get ahold of you. I dismissed it at first because, with the exception of One Little Victory, I couldn't find the guitar parts (I still can't find the solos) beneath all the layers of (grungy?) sound. And what I did find did not move me the way Rush has for 24 years.But the more you listen, the less that all seems to matter. The music (which had a U2'ish flavor. re: opening riff of Ceiling Unlimited. I never liked U2) blossoms right in front of your ears. The vocal melody, which didn't seem to have direction at first, begins to take shape. Nothing needs to be said about the lyrics or the drums.You'll find yourself singing choruses in your head while at work, justing wanting to give it another listen...another chance. Then another. And then another.Until finally you'll feel it and you'll understand. They had it right all along. Why? Because they are Rush and they are the masters."
4,Wonderful Rush Creation!!!! A Must Have!,"Rush has done yet another fantastic job at changing styles. I love all there old stuff, and the all the stuff from the synth years. Vapor Trails will take a little getting used to, but you will not be dissapointed! The only mediocre songs on the cd are, ""The Stars Look Down,"" and ""How it Is."" Everything else will stir your senses. Geddy's vocals and bass work will remind you again he is the greatest of all time. Neil's drums are always marvelous, and Alex has room to really rock out, however almost no solos. Not a good starter album, but for someone who has loved the band's changes through the years. I highly recommend it."
4,Another Good Offering from A Great Band,"Like every other Rush album (with the possible exception of Moving Pictures), Vapor Trails is a mix of great music, good music, and not-so-good music.The best songs, in my opinion, are Earthshine, Vapor Trail, One Little Victory and Freeze.. They just plain rock.Ceiling Unlimited, Peaceable Kingdom, Secret Touch, How It Is, and Out of Cradle are pretty good as well.The not-so-good songs are up for debate.One thing is for certain, Rush isn't done rocking yet. Not by a long shot. This album is just as hard and loud as anything the band has ever put out. Fans who got sick of Rush when they started using lots of synths in the mid-80's will be happy to hear they've done a complete reverse.Overall...Vapor Trails is a damn good album, and only those people who have unrealistic expectations of Rush's music would be disappointed."
4,Yet another phase of Rush - amazing,"This album takes the group through another path with modern Rush sounds, but perhaps, the heaviest album to date even compared to the first couple albums tunes: ""Finding my way"", ""I think I'm going bald"" etc. Definitely a must for the Rush fan, but also a just a good hard rock album. Great riffs, complex musical layers, interesting lyrics, makes you think kinda album - typical Rush.Rush proves that intellectual music can still be fun. I guess I'm already over Britney's head......You're never to old to Rock'n'roll!Just remember, if you are starting your Rush collection, get a strong shelf for the CDs, they have a lot of great ones."
4,New Territory,"At first listen to this new cd I was not real thrilled. After I listened to it a few times it grew on me more and more. Now I really like it. It still sounds like Rush, but they are exploring some new territory on this release. It has no keyboards and it has a more raw sound than their previous efforts. Alex has alot of room for guitar textures. Neil's drumming is typical Neil, but he plays harder on this album and it sounds really good. The big standout to me is Geddy's bass playing. He has always had alot of punch, but he has some bombastic low end on this cd. Very powerful and in your face bass playing. I'm glad to see that these three excellent players are still puting out the music. Remember, if you don't like it at first, give it a few spins, it will grow on you."
5,Traditional Rush Excellence,"I read a Modern Drummer interview of Neil Peart many years ago where he stated that many of Rush's songs are intentionally made to make the listener return for another listen, both out of love and curiosity. This becomes evident when listening to Vapor Trails.I set my expectations high at first listen, and was a little disappointed. However, curiosity and love drove me to listen again and I found myself saying ""How could I have been disappointed?""From the explosive entry of ""One Little Victory"" to the heart-pounding realism of ""Peacable Kingdom"" to the outstanding guitar melodies in ""How it is,"" non-rush fans will in no doubt be curious to give this one a 2nd or 3rd listen and grow to love the music.Now I can't get the CD out of my cd player and I've listened to the inspirational lyrics and outstanding music so much that the songs remain in my head throughout my day, keeping me going. I await their tour-stop in my town with great anticipation!!"
2,mostly melodic and textural hell,"First, I love RUSH. I have seen them countless times in many venues and have never been dissapointed...until VAPOR TRAILS. This album has virtually no melodic substance. It's as though they started jamming and Geddy sang whatever came to mind in a completely impromptu way. Melody and song structure are tough to grind out and RUSH didn't do the work necessary to produce masterpieces the likes of their earlier work. I never thought I'd be saying this about a band I have enjoyed for decades, but this record should never have been produced. On the bright side, however, the musicianship is, as always, tremendous. And my 2 stars are my testament to that."
4,Rush Rocks,Rush hit a home run with this one! I specifically like the guitar work from both Alex and Geddy. Neil was his usual awesome. It's powerful rhythms and strong vocals had me rocking along with each song. Didn't miss the keyboards - glad they got back to the old ways.
2,Good album destroyed by poor production,"I am a huge Rush fan, and I was certainly excited about this release. However, due to the poor production it just sounds awful, to the point where it is nearly unlistenable. The whole thing just sounds like a big, muddy mess. How Rush could have allowed it to be released in this state is beyond me. Sure, there are places on the Internet where you can find directions on how to ""fix"" this album (by ripping it into MP3's, correcting it somewhat and re-burning the CD), but when I buy a CD, I don't expect to become the band's new recording engineer.There are some high points despite the poor quality of the recording, especially ""One Little Victory"", ""Earthshine"", and ""Ghost Rider"". Listen to any of the Vapor Trails songs on the last two live recordings (""Rush in Rio"" and ""R30"") and you'll see how much better they sound than what is on this CD. Very disappointing - there's a reason why this is one of Rush's worst selling albums of all time, folks!"
4,"5 Stars for the standout tracks, however.","Yes, there are a number of fillers here --like any CD-- that earn 3 stars. But ""Peaceable Kingdom"", ""Secret Touch"", ""EarthShine"", and ""Freeze"" are 5 star material--As good as anything you'll hear from Moving Pics or Permanent Waves. The tracks are heavy, full of raw anger, and have not a shread of the predicability that has dogged prior attempts like ""Test for Echo"" and ""Hold Your Fire"".Geddy Lee must have been taking note from Les Claypool, he has moved to playing a ton of bass chords, which add to the CDs overall bottom heavy sound. Great, Great comeback!!"
4,"A complex, layered, challenging, and rewarding listen","I have not been a life-long Rush fan but have always enjoyed progressive rock as well as a wide variety of other musical styles. However, if you want to hear some challenging, hard rock, with layers of distorted guitar and bass and extremely energetic drumming, you probably can't beat Rush. The no-keyboard approach brings to the front, some more interesting bass lines from Geddy Lee. Each time I play this recording I hear new and interesting things going on. It has also help me enjoy their previous effort Test for Echo, more than I did previously. The only thing about Vapor Trails that I would change is to bring the vocals out more in the mix. Frequently, the guitars bass and drum layers are so dominating, the words are lost. Of course this was probably done on purpose. Despite this, I would highly recommend this recording."
4,Back to Form,"This is the true return to form for Rush. Vapor Trails has no keys. It's back to a trio of excellent musicians with melodic, clear and crafty guitar, passioned progressive percussion and some excellent bass used as both a foundation and in some cases taking the lead.The lyrics are solid and interesting. The vocals have good quality. The songs (musically speaking) are much more interesting than Test for Echo. If you were disappointed by that one, don't let it keep you away from Vapor Trails. You will be pleasantly surprised.The dynamics are definitely back. Whereas, T4E was flat and noisy, Vapor Trails has plenty of clarity and dynamics. The boys sound much more inspired this time 'round. To me, this one is the best they've done in quite some time all things considered.Although, I like for bands to mature and progress, I'd much rather Rush stay on the Vapor Trail than go back to Testing for Echo ... just my humble opinion, Rush Fans!"
3,Lower your expectations!,"I grew up listening to Rush and have been a fan since the 80s. This album bears little resemblance to the older, more polished Rush albums. It is dry, poorly mixed, and lackluster.After several listenings, I was hard-pressed to find a single ""compelling"" song, or even a melody that remained in my head. True, Rush has never been a pop group, but their earlier works were both musically brilliant *and* repeatedly listenable. This album is neither of those.If you've been listening to Rush as long as I have, I recommend that you skip this album. It's not the Rush of old. I'm quite disappointed and probably won't continue to buy their albums. If you want old Rush, get into Dream Theater. They make Rush look like amateurs!"
1,Terrible,"I am a huge Rush fan (since Signals). But this album is just terrible. If I had never heard of Rush before, I would think that they can't write songs. They all sound the same - it's hard to tell where one song ends and the next starts. This albums is eminently forgettable. Save your money."
2,Worst mixing since Subdivisions,"Regardless of what you think of Rush's latest musical direction (personally I think its mediocre), the sound quality and mixing of this CD is embarrasing and inexcusable in this day and age."
5,Pure joy and more,"Aggressive! Dark! Passionate! I've been waiting for this since Signals.If they would have included an instrumental on this CD, I would have passed out from sheer joy."
1,Rushed...,"I have to agree with Sughosh Varadarajan. Rush at they're most desparate to be different, along with trying to fit in with all the other crappy bands that are out there now. This album is very disjointed and noisy. Songs are difficult to grasp and very unmemorable. Seems like a rushed effort. Overall not much heart of true thought really went into making this album. Hopefully the next release will be an improvement."
1,Cacophony,"This has to be one of those most harsh, noisy, annoying records I've heard in a while. Mind you, I don't make a habit of hearing records like that, but I'd certainly never expected Rush to head in that direction. I haven't really followed their career as such, but what attracted me to Rush was their strong sense of melody within the progressive framework. Sadly, none of that is on display here. It's just a sonic assault from the word go, with completely nondescript songs.A poor effort from a band I'd only just begun to really respect. If you, like, me, have heard and loved ""Moving pictures"" and ""Permanent Waves"", you'll want to stay far, far away from this one."
1,"Thank you, Rush for the worst sounding album we can buy!!","Come one, come all. Want a horribly produced CD with great songs? VT is the album for you.Check out Disturbed's new album Believe. This thing is clipped all to hell (obviousy mixed/mastered hot), but it's not distorted and still comes through very clear and powerful. Korn's new album Untouchables is another shining example of hot production done right.With nearly 30 years in the business, you'd think Rush would be the example of how to produce an album. Apparently the new guys figured it out in a fraction of the time on thier own.If this is a new trend for the band, I should probably buy new speakers now to prepare for the next LOUDER IS BETTER masterpiece from Rush!"
1,Awful,"This is the worst Rush album ever. It lacks depth & imagination & sounds like it was recorded in a garage with a dictaphone. It's a shame because I was really looking forward to this album & was hoping I was going to hear something pretty diverse and interesting like the Rush of old, but I was severely disappointed & had to take it back to the store. In the past Rush have recorded some of my favourite material, but with this latest release they appear to have created a new genre of music - 'Regressive Rock.'"
1,Bad mix,"I love Rush ... I buy every CD they offer, but I was dissapointed in this release ... It gives me a headache. The real pitty is that beneath all the clipping and distortion there is some really good playing and songwriting and arrangements ... Unless you are a real diehard Rush fan skip this CD."
3,Great Songs - Worst Recorded Rush album ever.,"I really love some of the songs on this album, however the poor production quality and some very distorted / crackling parts really make parts of the album unlistenable. I am hoping that the Vinyl mix is better and I can find someone with a record Player so I can get a clean copy of the Album on CD. (Buy the LP and then Burn to a CD a decent copy).If you can live with the digital distortion and clipping then this is one of the Best Rush albums in a while."
5,Best Rush ever!!,"From two tragic events in Neil Peart's life come the best Rush lyrics ever. The songs are more personal than ever, and the playing is among the hardest rocking and best arranged Rush ever released. This album just proves that some bands do get better with age.I am glad to see them leave the synthesizers behind for a more raw guitar-bass-drums approach. This is what they do best, and they do it better than anyone else. Welcome back Rush!"
1,"bad sound, forgetable tunes","I am a hugh Rush fan - I have all their cds. My favorite is Power Windows (1980-1989 -best era for the band). But this cd? The sound is bad, no catchy bass lines or guitar riffs. This is not the Rush I used to love and listen too...Geddy, get back to basics! This cd is all over the place. Not even good for real fans. Avoid if this is your first Rush cd! This cd was made by another band."
4,"great songs, substandard production","Like many I've been a Rush fan for 25 years. I've enjoyed this excellent musical release but continue to wonder why the recording quality is poor. Both the dynamic range and soundstage are very limited, while the cd has a digital ""harsheness"" that I'm surprised to hear given that this issue was tackled by equipment manufacturers and recording engineers 10 years ago. A shame, since musically this is a unique and worthy release from one of the few remaining ""great progressive creators"" still in existence."
3,Objective Analysis,"Rush's Vapor Trails has the following characteristics:Dense, multi-layered, sometimes muddy production, particularly on the guitar tracks.More dissonance and non-traditional chord shapes/melodies than usual for Rush.Solid, thoughtful lyrics that are awkward in some places.Heavy distortion on the guitar, bass, and vocal tracks.Minimal use of syncopation, by Rush standards.Straightforward drumming with subtle fills.No keyboards.No guitar solos and very few lead guitar breaks.With one exception, no fadeouts at the ends of songs.More youthful energy in the rendering than in the songwriting.More reflection of current music trends than groundbreaking leadership.That's how it is. How it's going to be for any future Rush albums remains to be seen."
2,about as good as their last cd,"To me, this cd is a whole lot of noise with no real musical direction. Alot of the songs sound very similar and only a few really stick out. With the time these guys had after their last album you think each song would be different, but it sounds as if they wrote every song in one day. As a drummer, the drum parts are very simple which bummed me out.With the release of their 70's live cd as part of ""different stages"" i thought i was going to get something that was more old school, themed, lots of odd changes and fun to listen to but also fun to try and learn and play. there's nothing on this cd that makes me wanna pick up my sticks and play along to.I hope they get it right on their next cd"
2,Losing it?,"I've been listening to Rush since 1983, and they have since become my favorite band. I've listened to Vapor Trails six times now, and I still cannot get into it. There is a serious sense of evocation missing that is so characteristic of their music. I am going to give it a few more tries, but I am not optimistic. Before doing that, I think I'll listen to Permanent Waves or Exit...Stage Left first though."
4,Don't question their talent!,I had the opportunity to see this band live in Toronto on July 17 '02 and was blown away by their talent. To really appreciate them is to see them live as there is no way a cd captures the total of their sound.This cd may not be their best but is still very good. If you have an opportunity to take them in live don't pass them up because they rock non stop for three hours!
3,"Good, but too much!","I guess old Lemmy likes the opening track ""One little victory"" - chaos and panic! The album is rather good, but it's kinda too much. I wish the guys could have been less into the idea of filling every little space with music/sound. Sometimes less is more. The best songs are ""Ceiling unlimited"", ""Ghost rider"" and ""Sweet miracle"". But as said before, the albums grows and after several listenings you'll find yourself like it more and more."
3,"Good, but not Great","I have been a Rush fan ever since Presto and of course their work before Presto is their absolute best. I think Rush has given a valiant effort here, but they have fallen short. In my opinion, the songs are unmemorable (even after three or four listens) and I find myself often ""skipping"" ahead to the next song because I'm getting tired of the current song. As always, their lyrics are memorable and wonderful, they just don't have a very good structure to hold on to (again, in my opinion). I would not recommend this to anyone as a first Rush album, but for the devout Rush fan, it's probably worth picking up."
1,What the [in the world] are they singing about!,"I love Rush, but this is bad. What happened to Tom Sawyer?"
2,The curtain is falling...,"I have loved Rush since junior high, but this album demonstrates the wisdom of the saying ""quit while you're ahead."" Maybe I'm being too harsh, but these songs just aren't interesting for the most part and they sound like the last gasp efforts of a band that's beyond its prime. Rush is a great band, as their live concerts attest, but all good things must come to an end. They would have been better to stop at Counterparts. Nothing since then, with the exception of Different Stages (Live) has added to their legacy."
2,Sorry but........,"Sorry guys - I am a huge Rush Fan going back to my teenage years, but this album just does not have it. I cant hear any of the great drums of Peart. WHere are songs like Tom Sawyer? Even my 16 year old likes the old Rush stuff. This album is a great disappointment."
5,RUSH RETURNS,"Rush is back ,this album rocks.a progression album that makes up for not only the years they were on haitus but also the not so inventive albums of resent release. My last fav album from RUSH being HOLD YOUR FIRE. Pay no attention to the naysayers you will not be disappointed"
1,vapor fails!,"I just bought Rush's Vapor Trails along with Deep Purple's latest, Rapture of the Deep and couldn't have had a more one sided listening experience. What a surprise.My two favorite bands seem to be going in different directions and I`m not talking about musical directions. I can't believe how AWFUL Vapor Trails is, the sound quality is just plain bad, the arrangements feel forced and the songs simply aren't good, let alone memorable. The lyrics are good, but that doesn't matter when the rest of it just sits there. I'm struggling just getting through this thing.On the other hand, Rapture of the Deep is everything Vapor Trails isn't. Great performances, fantastic songs, great lyrics, good sound quality. Deep Purple sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the flow of the album is just outstanding.It's safe to say this is not Rush`s finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple`s.Vapor Trails = 1/2 starRapture of the Deep = 4 1/2 stars"
1,pretty awful,"i'm writing this as not a huge rush fan...just a shadow in there play so this was my first album i had bought by them.. and i was really excited when i put this in my CD and was blow by the riff of ""one little victory"" then came two poor efforts ""ceiling unlimited"" ""ghost rider"" then it picks up with the fantastic song ""peaceable kingdom"" with it's heavy riff then really after that i turn the album off because it become MEDIOCRE so really they could of put ""peaceable kingdom"" on the single ""one little victory"" and left the rest of the songs in the valt because they are AWFUL.. when it has no substance...i won't be buying anymore rush albums"
1,what happened?,This has to be one of the poorest efforts ive heard from RUSH.I am one of their biggest fans(even the B sides).I hope the CD that i purchased was a bad copy but waiting this long for possibly their last release is making me wonder.I wonder if the band actually ever writes the songs together anymore.A JAM can create an awesome outcome; in the same room. Let the musician write music and the producer do his job.Soooory
2,Not the Rush of old,"I've listened to this CD three times or more at work and I'm still wondering if it is ever going to sound good. The only song I like on it is ""Vapor Trail"", the other songs just don't grab me. Maybe Rush has run out of good material. Most groups run out a lot sooner. Some of these songs sound annoying, not characteristic for Rush. If it was their first album I'd probably like it more but when I consider what has come before there aren't practically any of their other albums that I like less than this one. To make things even worse, the sound is muddled throughout the whole CD."
1,Boring,"The first minute of Vapor Trails - I thought - would be a sample of how powerful the rest of the album would be. I was wrong. Each track, after the title, blends with the other and could easily be mistaken for a track on Test For Echo.Rush is starting to sound boring...and that is something I never thought I would say."
3,Old Formula Fails,"Rush has a formula for writing songs. The drummer writes these amazing poems, and then the music is written. And it used to work. But the formula doesn't work for this album. These lovely lyrics, set to (as always) great drumming, ""oh my god"" guitar playing, and superb bass, run foul on the most uninspired melodies I have ever heard. I want to love the next Rush album, but was disappointed in this one. If I could turn off Lee's boring melodies and just hear him saying the lyrics it would be better. Pert is such a good poet, I don't see why they don't reverse the formula. Better effort next album."
4,Rush is back in business...and it was well worth the wait!,"Vapor Trails is the most solid offering by Rush in a long time, probably since 1991's Roll the Bones. If there's any ""filler"" on here, I haven't found it yet! I give it four stars instead of five because the mixing sound a little muddier on some tracks then their last outing, Test for Echo; yet it's far better than the ""bassless"" production of the aforementiond Roll the Bones. But don't let that detract the would-be listener. Rush fans will be pleasantly surprised by this comeback!!"
4,Sounds Good,"The album's themes are a bit of a downer, but Rush's themes have been down since Signals. Otherwise, I like the guitar wall-of-sound. Lee and Lifeson have a dynamic here similar to the one they got on Moving Pix, where all the instruments seem to meld into one. The drums seem a bit too dry, and it is hard to make out Geddy's voice. I don't know if the mastering is the problem or if Rush purposely produced a sound to 'bug' people (or even if it's just the sound they currently are working with - the Rush in Rio DVD is even more distorted), but that is the effect. They achieve a Tool-like disturbancer, but through an opposite means - Tool's sound is highly-polished - their lyrics and their approach are what disturbs you. Here, it's Rush's sound that does it. Nevertheless, ""One Little Victory"", ""Earthshine"" and ""Secret Touch"" are all cool tunes, and Peart's lyrics really are some of his deepest and most inspiring."
5,Listen,"It is interesting to see how the Rush fans react to a new album. Over the last six years I had been drifting into new musical areas, primarily European progressive music. The more intricate music of the European bands, like Ayreon, The Gathering, Mostly Autumn, Threshold, aren't known in the U.S. but they replaced my favorite Rush. Now with Rush back, I really enjoyed their sound minus the keyboards.This album is a HARD ROCK album. It is not progressive or neo-prog style. It is not symphonic rock. It is a just hard rocking. It is what Alex wanted Rush to be all along.I can't wait to here the songs in concert. Secret Touch, Peaceable Kingdom, and One Little Victory will be awesome to see live. The show should have much more energy than the 80's shows when Geddy was tied to complicated keyboards.So, if you want progressive music, go listen to some of the great new progressive groups. But if you want some hard rock to listen to Vapor Trails will do just fine."
5,Rocking Concept,"I'm a huge RUSH fan, and besides of saying that the CD is excellent, I was shocked of the content of the lyrics. All of RUSH fans have grown together with each new record. This time, Peart's message is as strong as ever, and it is something we all should be aware of. The whole VP concept is about what is really happening on earth, and gives us tips on how we can explore what is usually misunderstood. The Tarot cards are great, Peart is an illuminated, a master. We are part of the billion other voices who spread other news. Excellent evolution."
1,"Deserves a 0, but here we go with a 1","Hooray, Rush it back.Hooray, we have a new album.Boo, the production is horrible and anyone giving this album 5 stars is insane. 5 stars means the album succeeds in songwriting, performance, and production. The performances, though admittedly pieced together on a computer are good. The songwriting, again the result of piecing together jams on a computer, are also good. The production, well, can an album sound any worse?For those that own the Rush in Rio DVD, check out the Vapor Trails tracks used as background music for the documentary. Notice a difference in sound quality and clarity? The original recordings or mixed tracks were obviously damaged between leaving the studio and reaching the pressing plants. Clean up this CD, already!!!"
1,I wish they hadn't released this album.,"Despite being a big Rush fan, I could not take this album. If you like the modern day alternative music, you would like this album. Yes, true Rush has always evolved, but it should evolve better than rest of the music-world, thats the standard Rush has set for me as far as I am concerned and anything less is not acceptable, no matter they are old, or Neil Pert lost his family. I think Geddy Lee should have explored more of his tempo/music like he demonstrated in his ""Favorite Headache"". In other words, I am not listening to Vapor Trails again, I have already given it couple of tries. Sorry if I offend you."
1,This is Rush?,"30 years in music with such incredible albums as 2112, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Presto, etc. and THIS is what Rush releases after their hiatus? THIS is worthy of being included in thier catalog? Rush have lost it musically. I think they've lost their hearing too (the sound quality is atrocious for a modern day, major release). Very disappointing."
1,[WAFFLE !!!],"If my wife ever came home from a beauty parlor with a Marge Simpson hairdo, I would take my best friend and companion to the side and tell her honest and forthright "" Honey, before the whole world tells you...you look like a goat..."" Alex...Neil...Geddy...this album...ya'lls only album...is [terrible]!!! I am thankful only 1 out of the 25 RUSH albums I've got is bad."
2,Lost the the Fame,"I love Rush, but this is not their best album to be nice. Perhaps all the praise is from those who just crave a new album. This one is overproduced and in laborious to listen to."
4,"you feel Peart's pain, but you see the hope and healing","Rush is one of those few bands that continue to constantly evolve, but still maintain a unique sound and maintain excellent musical skills. Peart's DW drums sound darker but the complex time chops are subtle, but present. Geddy's bass is more melodic while the layers of guitar and mandolins from Alex and the layered background vocals sound more organic and natural than the keyboards anyday.My favorite tracks are Earthshine (completely re-written from lyrics and music), Nocturne, Ghost Rider, How it Is (the first time I heard the chrous, it reminded me of the Beatles) and Secret Touch.Peart's lyrics go from the abstract and nebulous to the personal realm, from the thematic to the emotional realms. We have seen through the lyrics the hurt, wondering, tragedy, fear, and the heartache in the words, but more importantly, the travels back via the healing road and the new excitement and quest for life."
3,Rush is back with new hard sound,I just got this album and have listened to it while working 4 times. I am not sure what to think. It just isn't grabbing me like most of there albums do. I think in time this album will grow on me and my rating will improve. If you are a drummer of course the doctors drumbeats are amazing as always.Now that a year has gone buy I hate this album. It sucks. It is missing something and I just can't say what. I don't listen to it anymore and will probably sell it or give it away. Sorry rush Its the only rush album I don't like at least one song on.
4,Rush Returns,"Rush's first record in 5 years is their most personal and introspective statement ever. There is no ""Tom Sawyer"" or ""Spirit of Radio"" here, but it is still a fitting return from one of the finest rock bands ever."
1,Horrible mix!!!!,I love Rush. I have a full collection of their works. This is their all time worst CD. It is the worst mix of any professionally released cd ever!!! Every single song is clipping. Check out this link ...The really sad part is that behind this awful mix is some good writing and playing. The problem is the mix is sooo muddy that you can't really hear it. This CD is defective and should be recalled and remixed and reissued. Whoever is responsible for mixing this should be flogged.Jeff
1,Just bad,What surprises me is that this album gets any good rewievs at all. This is without doubt the worst Rush album ever. Come on! What happened to the band that made albums like Moving Pictures and Permanent Waves. This album is unlistenable. The production is a mess. Even after listening to the album several times it is impossible to find anything of value. It is just sad.
4,give it a chance.,"I was hoping for a great fantastic cd . IT is good though ,not the best but good but just listen a few times . It will grow on you . It seems like a hybrid of test for echo and counter parts ..If you like that . Still good and different for the times . Not for all but I like it ,it may not reach expectations . I have no real complaints ..Just go with a hunch thats all i can tell you ...."
4,Fasten your Seatbelt,"Rush is back to their early days with Vapor Trails. If you like hard-driving guitar rock and roll you will love this album. The first few notes of ""One Little Victory"" instantly reminded me of Fly By Night, it's like their synthesizer-rock albums of the 1980s never happened. Over the years I've come to love the guitar solos of Alex Lifeson, but you won't find any on this offering. Also, there aren't any of the complex songs like my favorite ""The Trees"" from Hemispheres. Don't forget to fasten your seat belt before you hit the play button on this one."
1,Does presentation count for anything?,"Yeah, the songs are pretty [darn]good and it's great to even have an album after what this band's been through, but the way VT was presented as an ""official release"" is pathetic. If the whole point of this album was for the guys to get reaquinted, hang out, jam and ""see what happens"", then treat it as such. Don't toss this sonic trash to the fans through a major label when you know it's far from ready for mainstream. You actually want fans to pay for this [fluff]? As if this album, with its horrible production quality, can even stand up with the rest of Rush's catalog. VT should have been released as a free download on the web. Yeah, the songs are good, even though they were pasted together on a damn computer, but the presentation is attrocious.(Why can't we have a 0 star rating?)"
2,I just don't get it!,"I'm a huge Rush fan (since 1982) and I alway have been. I own every album and have seen them in concert four times (it'll be five times after August 17th) but I hate to say it, I just don't like this album. Nothing about the songs stick with me. It seems like our beloved boys from Canada are trying too hard to be ""modern"". The melody's are confusing, Neils lyrics are cryptic, and Geddy's voice is lost in a cavalcade of overwrought riffs.Another problem is the albums length. 70+ minutes! Why oh why do bands today feel the need to fill every bit of CD space with sound even when most of it is filler ....? 1980's Permanent Waves barely cracks 30 minutes and only has six songs but every song is wonderful and melodic.I know Rush will never again achieve the heights they reached in the early 80s but they can surely do better than this. Especially when we have to wait 5 years between albums."
4,Rush is back,"Rush is back. The boys have done it again. Gone are the synthesizers and poppy sound, back is the real raw sound that has been their trademark in the past. Rush has satisfied this avid Rush listener with a smile. I expected an ok album based on past records by them and have discovered a tasty treat. Way to knock yourselves out boys !What makes this album so tasty is it's fresh approach to songwriting. The break that they had (due to the drummer's unfortunate tragedies) have made this album a complex, yet well composed and user friendly piece of work.Way to go, boys !"
2,Average and strange,"Ok, RUSH surprised us all in a strong manner. But that does not mean the album is greta. The songs do not have an identity, they are faceless and do not stick to your memory.I liked the xclusion of the keyboards."
2,Not worth the wait,"Being a Rush fan for over twenty years, the long awaited return of the Canadian trio keep me anxiously awaiting May14th, the day Vapor Trails would finally be released. Perhaps the group should have waited a bit longer and written some better songs. This is the worst Rush recording since ""Hold Your Fire"". Each song melds in to one another before they become indistinguishable. The cd, although clearly not lacking for passion, does lack for content. This is clearly an instance where the parts do not equal the whole. Where are Alex Lifeson's signature guitar solos? Where are the meledoy's that syat in your head? Where are the infamous Rush licks? It always takes me two or three listens to really get into new Rush albums but I am having serious difficulties getting through even a second listen. Oh well. Let me go listen to ""counterparts"" See you all on tour."
2,Wait for a Remaster,"If we're lucky, we'll get a remaster of this CD while we're still alive to hear it. Vapor Trails contains some of Rush's best songs, but thanks to the Loudness War, they're virtually unlistenable. The sound quality of this CD is about as bad as can be imagined. Rush's record company owes fans a remaster."
1,Very poor quality for a major release,"I gotta give this album something because the songs are so good, but the production is a disgrace. I would be embarassed if my band released an album that sounded this poor, especially if we were distributing through a major lable like Atlantic. Shame on Atlantic too, for giving this their stamp of approval."
5,Best Rush Album Yet,"This is my second review. My first one was over 8 months ago. I just want to say that Vapor Trails has become my favorite Rush album (which by default makes it my favorite album). It would have been inconceivable to me that Rush could do better than Moving Pictures, Hemispheres or Fairwell to Kings. Hold Your Fire was the the last really great Rush album for me (although I do like all the ones that followed except maybe Presto). Vapor Trails has turned it all around again. I just hope they keep releasing albums. Anyone that can't hear the genius in this album just hasn't given it a chance. Play the full album 10 times and then decide."
2,Not the Rush you knew,"This disk is the manifestation of a band that has abandoned the formula that made it great.I am a life-long Rush fan. Rush should be in the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame. I have a framed digital photo of Neil Peart above my fireplace, for Christ's sake.The long intros and brilliant anthems are long gone here, folks.If you are a new Rush fan, PLEASE buy Exit Stage Left, Moving Pictures, or any of their early works. These guys are brilliant, but they can't seem to realize where their success lies... It's in the music, Gentlemen - not the vocals!!!!!I will continue to buy Rush music, but only because they will continue to remaster their finest work."
1,It is muddy instead of clean.,The only song I really get into is Earthshine. To me Rush should be the trend setter not the follower. This is a grunge album not a progressive album. Grudge was great in 1992 but not in 2002. If this album was released ten years ago then it would have been heralded as fresh and brilliant. To me it is like listening to Pearl Jam with Geddy's voice.I don't like the sound of mud. I miss the clarity that Alex can produce -- instead it is just too mushy for me. It is like the song Stick It Out on steroids.I heard an interview where Geddy claimed Power Windows was his favorite Rush album. Maybe they will get all this grunge stuff out of their system and the next album will be a more of a trend setter and progressive one.
4,welcome back rush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've been a huge fan since I was a kid in grammar school listening to 2112. It's been a long 5 years and it has been worth the wait!!!! The main knock on Rush for the last 15-20 years is that they turned into a keyboard band, well fear not fellow rockers, there is not a keyboard to be heard on the entire album!! It takes several listenings to really appreciate the complexity of the songs, but eventually you will. Can't wait to see them tour this summer!!!!!!"
1,A bad turn,"Muddy. Drums are almost lost in the mix. Guitars are a wall of sound with no distinction. An interesting new style from Geddy, singing random notes in the background behind his vocal, attempted on almost every song. I've yet to find a memorable melody in the vocals or guitars.I've always been a truly devoted fan, but find this a big disappointment. It's almost as if it hadn't been listened to during the studio mix."
1,a true disappointment,"It's a relief to read all these negative reviews about Rush's latest sorry effort. I just came from another music site that gave this stinker a positive review, and I just had to come here hoping I could find the truth. It seems our trio has really found inspiration, in the simplistic rock music that's been pumped out in the last ten years or so. This talk you see in magazines about ""getting back to the guitar"", losing the keyboards, and making a more ""raw sound"" really sounds like a lot of [junk], and it's also very unbecoming for their age and maturity. The general disappointment in the lack instrumental quality, and the excess of vocals( Lee just will not shut up from beginning to end)has already been pointed out in the other reviews.I really see a promising future for these guys, in the instumental rock/fusion-superband scene that's going on today. As far as teenage garage rock, let's hope this is the end."
2,Rush the other direction,"The only reason this CD got 2 stars is because it is rush, if it was anyone else, it would be 1 star. This album is astounding in that sounds nothing like what i have come to expect from rush. There are no odd time signatures, no guitar solos, no instrumentals, it is incredibly repetitive (i could keep going) This album seems like it was thrown together in about an hour, very disapointing, sounds like rush's attempt to be a mainstream rock band. I guess i get a little upset when bands who earn respect and a good following throw it all away assuming that they will gain more fans, but end up losing a good chunk of there fans and end up doing county fair tours for the next 20 years. I hate to throw rush in that category but they have earned that also. I wouldn't buy it again if i could go back in time. ..."
2,Best days clearly behind them,"Disappointing. I went to four Rush concerts in a row in the 80's, beginning with Signals and ending with Hold Your Fire. Their last really good effort was Power Windows. At one time they were the ""thinking man's"" hard rock band, and while they still are to a degree, they should hang it up. This CD has been reviewed as being the hardest they have played in some time. That is true, but that hardly makes it good. The one thing I was most disappointed with was the fact that on this CD, they repeat lines over and over again just like every other band out there.Pull out anything in your collection from Power Windows back to the beginning. Do not bother with this one"
2,Rush,"Chris Barlow's review was excellent and conveys most of my feelings about it. I had heard the Neil Peart suffered some personal loses last year with wife and daughter. I think the band's on auto-pilot right now which shows from the no-letup heavy approach from track to track. This album reminds me of a lot of musically solid albums I've heard in the past that did not have the required elements to set the songs apart from each other, and which resulted in a body of work that did not make a lasting impression. Maybe I'm getting old, but I'm not willing to give even Rush, a 5-10 uninterrupted listening in order for it to grow on me. Songs like ""Roll the Bones"" had alot of breaks and tempo changes, and changes to vocals. The listener needs this to keep engauged. Rush might have been looser and more experimental 10-12 years ago. Here there's no keyboards, Aimee Mann, or quirkiness to make it an enjoyable listen."
2,Wow.,"Never in my life did I think I would have to repeat a 2-star-rating for Rush, the other dismal effort being ""Counterparts."" What a mess. I have listened to this less often than any of their albums, and I never listen to ""Counterparts"" anymore. What a sad effort. It is time for these guys to set their egos aside and seek out a new producer. Or, dare I say it about my all-time favorite band, just go away. Listening to these guys fade into late middle-age is depressing."
2,just letting off steam ....I guess,"This is the album that after a long love affair, made me come to terms with my relationship ..............yep honey, I just have to move on!!! If this appeals to a new audience that's great BUT it ain't for me."
4,LAST RUSH STUDIO ALBUM...???,"RUSH tried something radically new here. Much better than their synth-plagued previous records, which sounded flat and emotionless and punchless.VAPOR TRAILS will hit you in the stomach. It's a totally new Rush, without any keyboards at all, with a more ""acommodated"" NEil Peart, with a dirt guitar sound (ALex tried too hard to sounds ""modern"" - the only great flaw of the album).I never liked Peart's lyrics, but here they are worse than ever, unfortunately... But Geddy sings them well and hard, with a changed voice.Thanks, the keyboards are gone! Welcome back RUSH!!But I think this is their last ablum... I don't know, it's just a guess..."
1,Hooked for being a fan,"Unfortunately after ""Presto"" , I have always had the feeling of wasting my money after listening to every new release, and this CD confirms it.Come on, guys, you know that each and every fan you have will buy all your records withouth ever thinking. Why not stuffing some music into them?"
3,Rush-ins,"I liked this album. The music was really nice. I got it the day before it officially came out and listened to it end to end. Thank God that Mr. Lifeson disposes with any inane lead guitar adventures for this latest release. Geddy Lee is a really good bassist too, as always. But, my trained opinion is that the band listened to Sunny Day Real Estate alot after noticing that the former's final release, ""The Rising Tide"" sounded somewhat like them. It was copied copied photograph, to speak metaphorically, I thought.Neil Peart is really out there though. . .a first class pseudo-intellectual. Yes I am sorry about his familial losses, for the court record. He sure can pound the pigskins proficiently, granted, but the lyrically ponderous pontification in this album borders precariously close to polemics and is purposefully pretentious, methinks.Nevertheless, enjoy the music for itself. . ."
4,A miracle.,"I suspect this album infuriates plenty of fans for not being the magic bullet, a la 'Moving Pictures'. Whenever Rush releases an album, there is criticism, and I'm no stranger to being hard on my favorite group.All the more strange then, that I find Vapor Trails to be as close to a perfect Rush album as there could have been. The band has achieved a kind of resolution of its various flecks of inspiration over the years, and has done a reasonable job incorporating what it has learned into this album. Rush sounds comfortable sounding like itself, without parroting.This is a group for which there is no linear progression. I mean that as a compliment. Fans of Rush should buy this album and listen to it closely. It's all over the place, and the historical echoes are strong.This one is (unintentionally) for the fans. Enjoy the miracle."
2,Go Bananas instead!,"I just bought Vapor Trails along with Deep Purple's latest album, Bananas (import) and couldn't have had a more one sided listening experience.Two of my favorite bands seem to be going in different directions and I`m not talking about musical directions. I can't believe how awful Vapor Trails is, the sound quality is just plain bad, the playing lacks spark and the songs simply aren't good or memorable.The arrangements feel forced and Rush just don't sound like they are having FUN!I'm struggling just getting though the CD.On the other hand, Bananas is everything Vapor Trails isn't. Great songs, fantastic performances, terrific sound quality, Deep Purple sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the flow of the album is just outstanding.It's safe to say this is not Rush`s finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple`s."
4,One Star?????Are you crazy?,"Personally, I loved this CD. It took me awhile to appreciate how good the songs on this CD are, but every time I listened to it, it just got better and better. I wouldn't say Vapor Trails is Rush's best album, but it is up there. As said in another review, just listen to it and sooner or later it will ""click"" and you'll see just how accomplished these musicians are. I went to the concert in Charlotte, 2002. It was awesome. I will never forget it."
2,"tedious, disconnected, disappointing","I am a huge fan of Rush, but I was really disappointed in this album. The album in general, but especially the vocals, are tedious and uninspiring. This album lacks many of the qualities that earned this trio their well-deserved status as a masterful force in rock and roll. While they have learned to incorporate some new styles into their compositions, they lack the art of past works. The different instruments seem disconnected, not tightly and masterful integrated as they once were. There were a few interesting phrases, but no good solid tracks.If you're new to Rush and you'd like a great set of songs from the height of their career (in my opinion), buy ""Exit, Stage Left"" instead."
3,"Idiosyncratic in Rush style, but does not click.","Or maybe it clicks a bit too much? I'm a very big Rush fan, as I have been for a while, and I tend to like their less regarded work more than their mainstream stuff (Test For Echo, Hold Your Fire, A Farewell to Kings...) but for some reason, this album just does not work out - for a few reasons. The mastering process of this album seems fatally flawed... the guitars sound like chainsaws from a Jason movie - and sometimes they just become inaudible in noise. The textures are there and the sound is well - in fact, this album sounds GREAT live judging by the songs they played on the supporting tour. Earthshine, Peaceable Kingdom, Sweet Miracle, and a few others are some of the best Rush tracks done in 15 years. However, it's just too noisy, too poorly produced. This album would probably recieve four or five stars if it had the quality productions from the Rupert Hine and Peter Collins albums."
3,Bring back producer Terry Brown and synthesizers!,"Rush has been my favorite 80's band for years, but I sure do miss the glory days of Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Signals and Grace Under Pressure. Every album since then has been a cacophony of mush, and the aptly-named Vapor Trails is no exception. If you like progressive hard rock with lots of textured syncopation, I highly recommend the much fresher-sounding Hybrid Theory, by Linkin Park."
3,NOT THEIR BEST,"yes, the productions stinks.to the guy that wrote ""Whiny, intolerant lyrics""""I trust that those two do not share the drummer's ugly, ungrateful and immature nature.""yeah, Alex and Geddy have tolerated Neil's ""ugly, ungrateful and immature nature"" for the past 30+ years.Their success and the bond they share speaks for itself, ""Whiny, intolerant lyrics"" and all"
4,new Rush,"this is pure Rush you may have to play this cd a few times to really get into it put then its right up there with the rest of the Rush cd,s"
4,- A tour de force -,"An amzing album. Strangely it grew up on me instantly, on the second listening I think. What an amazing album this is. Indeed a great progress in the always-changing Rush sound. Keyboards are gone, and so is the 80's sound which I didn't really enjoyed. Guitar work is as heavy and solid as it can be. (The heaviest Rush album I think). The song arrengements are beatuful, well worked, ambitious. Alex Lifeson is a machinegun of riffs here, hard beautiful and strange riffs. Neil is as accurate and solid as ever, a great drum job here. Especially for the beggining of ""One Little Victory"", a great opener. Geddy Lee's vocals had aged well, and now his vocal arrengements are stonishing and beautiful. A rock solid album, if not the best of Rush, ranks among the best...Worth buying, even if it costed 40 bucks. Great job."
4,Vapour Snails,"When I first played vapoure trails I wasn`t all that impressed,it wasn`t untill the third play that the goodnes started toshine through. Like most fine art the first impression are the shallowest, musicians like Rush Know this. Neil Peart is a fine percusionist/ lyricist and Alec and Geddy offer exellent supportall of this merging in a synergy. This CD also contains plenty of emotion ,at times you feal through the lyrics Neil Peart has grown spiritualy, its progressive but not over the topIts not classic Rush but it is the best thing they have released in the last fifteen years , some parts are beautiful and its always engaging.Still not MAGNA CARTA worthy, there are better CD`s around.I would give this, by the standard Rush has set for themselves7.5/10 this is an honest mark, my loyalty wants to give it more."
2,Creative and interesting..............,"But with excessive layering and over-production and mixing there is just a lot of noise from some of the best musicians around. There are some good sounds and mixes but the sound usually gets so thick that the interest fades. I can't see myself going down the road and hitting replay. I would like to see them go back to one guitar, one bass and the drums/percussion again and even some synthesizers."
2,How NOT to produce a record,"This has got to be the worst major label production I've heard in years. The production is not merely a distraction. It comes close to making this CD completely unlistenable.Some bright engineer decided to completely hard line limit and compress this recording. If you pop it in after any other RUSH release, particularly some of the old classic stuff, you will notice right away that it is MUCH LOUDER. Unfortunately, it's the sonic equivalent of READING ALL CAPS. It grows tiresome very quickly. I simply can't overlook this.Also, while the lyrics are nice and perhaps even a touch above the last couple releases, Rush appears to be adrift musically. Yes, I get the no guitar solos and straight ahead thing they're trying to do. I just find myself less interested in it. Rush is no longer that special of a band if this is what they have in mind."
2,Disappointing at Best,"This album contains some of the worst mixing I've ever heard. The guitars are so muddled I can't even pick out individual chords. Most of the songs are grating and lack any real hooks. With any Rush album, you have to listen to it all the way through at least three times to get a full appreciation of the music, lyrics, and rhythm. I listened to this one five times and still didn't like it.I expected more from these guys after masterpieces like 2112, Grace Under Pressure, and Roll The Bones. Seems like they've finally run out of new directions to explore.Don't buy this album if you are a Rush fan familiar with all their work."
5,The evolution of RUSH!,"This, and The Church ""After Everything Now This"", are the 2 best releases of 2002 so far. 'Vapor Trails' stands tall, with songs that work, even without keys or lead guitar. The sound is fresh, new, and coherent. Their legendary level of musicianship continues on. Rush, are, once again masterful! Neil Peart's new book titled: 'Ghost Rider' is phenomenal as well. If you get a chance, it is highly recommended!"
2,It's okay....,"I can't put my finger on it... it rocks hard, has songs with challenging arrangements...but, I just can't get into this CD....and I'm a HUGE Rush fan. This CD will probably never move from beyond my bottom 5. Along with the terrible noise, crackles and pops, the whole project just seems kinda sloppily put together."
3,Production?,"I am a typically absurd Rush fanatic, loving almost 99% of everything they've ever done, but... what happened on the production/mixing end of this album? It sounds like the monitors & headphones used in the recording studio were a pair of tin cans with string tied to them.Lyrically the album is incredible, but I find myself having to massively rearrange my eq settings every time i try to listen to it. If I could get a master recording and remix it on my computer I would probably be able to listen to it more and review this more favorably, but I just can't get past the mix."
3,Lets start the debate,"As I am sure there will be many varying opinions pro and con. Firstly I am a casual Rush listener surrounded by friends who are avid fans so I have heard my fair share of their cds. I have not heard much different here! Yes, they sound like Rush as only Rush can and yes they are accomplished musicians but I was not all that impressed after hearing this cd considering we have all waited so long for this release. To be honest I would recommend Geddy Lee's last solo effort ""My Favourite Headache"" before this newest effort by Canadas trio."
5,No Keyboards = Geddy's Voice,"I was quite amazed with this release. The vocals on Sweet Miracle, when Geddy is crying ""Oh salvation"", are simply astounding. Suspending the use of keyboards was the best thing they could have done. It's been a long time since we have been treated to Geddy's unique voice. Incredibly satisfying release. There's real sould in this music. The engineering is pure and the sound is big."
2,Not So Hot,"OK, I know what they are trying to do here. They wanted to ""update"" their sound and they did. Now they have [bad] sound production like the rest of the NEW bands, no guitar solos, and no keyboards. BLAH!I love RUSH and I'm one of their biggest fans, but really, this album is NOT SO HOT. I have listened to it many times and grows on ya a little, but the sound is so muddy and Lees voice so tinny, that you cannot help tiring of it quickly.Rush needs to get back to the days of Counterparts, Roll The Bones, Presto, but with better sound production on albums like Hemispheres, and Moving Pictures.Cmon' guys, the true fans are NOT 16 year olds that think that mp3 is ""CD Quality"". We are older and wiser than that."
2,PRODUCTION AWFUL,"Who mixed this? I have not heard such a poorly produced CD since U2's ""Pop"". And it is a shame because ""Vapor Trails"" is a decent disc in terms of musicianship. Well played by the canadian trio.But the muddled sound and even distorted Alex Liefson jams really make a good CD VERY disappointing.Note to Rush: Listen to the final tapes before you release them to the record label for mass production."
2,Vapor Trails,I hate to say it but this CD blows. I am a long time RUSH fan and I love their music. But this recording seems contrived and put together. I really think they would have been better off not releaseing it.I tried to sell it to my local used CD store and they said they had too many. Enough said.
4,I can't stop listening to it,"I love this album, but whoever mixed it overdrove it on the master, and it sounds pretty distorted at times. Really wish they'd re-master it."
3,Good songs marred by terrible recording quality.,"There are some great songs on here, such as Peaceable Kingdom, Earthshine, Secret Touch, Ceiling Unlimited, etc. But the recording quality of the CD is awful. At times the songs sound like one distorted, muddy mess. It's a shame this good material is compromised by such subpar sonic quality."
4,fabulous,"wow, i've missed the old rush for a while. this cd is an incredible comeback.beautifully crafted, heartful, earthy tones compile the greater part of this album. easily digestible yet powerful in oh, so many ways.a great purchase definitely."
5,Kicks bum HARD,"Hehe, if you didn't like RUSH before chances are you won't like em now. Geddy's still singing ;)HOWEVER--and that's a big however in case you missed it--this album is lots more spontaneous and crunchy than Test For Echo, their last studio work. Now I know why the boys have been humming and hawing about the quality of this thing: they definitely took some risks. But instead of taking the risks into an artsy fartsy musical direction, they just kept the typical RUSH layers-within-layers down to a dull roar. I KNOW there are patterns on this thing, but they're spread over the whole CD!It's like RUSH woke up one morning, forgot to brush it's teeth, and decided to go play a bar! This CD definitely ROCKS! Very impressive!I hope not too many of the ""youngin"" bands are peeved at these guys for still taking up space in the pop culture :) Looks like the boys are back!"
3,different sound but bland,"The first few reviews have captured very well the feelings I have about this album. It has taken many listens to finally come to grips with many of the songs. Initially it was like a wall of sound as was previously written. Eventually the songs have differentiated into their own, but the album still does sound like one long song.There is not a single guitar solo on the entire album, which is shocking to me given Alex's complaints in the past about being overshadowed by keyboards. Rush finally produce a keyboard-less album, and Alex grinds away on power chords and overdubs :). With the exception of the first song, Neil's drumming is kind of bland. Geddy's bass play is top notch and fun to follow as usual, but I really don't like his voice on this album.Still, it's a new Rush album, and I'm grateful :).I think these songs will rock live given their frenetic pace and rich guitar sound, and sprinkled with songs from previous albums, this tour should be excellent."
5,Vapor Trails - The best Rush Album,"Like many others it took a few listens for me to get into Vapor Trails. Now I think that is by far the best album they have done. Each track is excellent - consistent hevy rock music. Peaceable Kingdom and Freeze are as close as I've heard to the perfect track. Earthshine is simply beautiful. Where other albums have had there strong and weak points, Vapor Trails is a tower of strength. If only they'd tour in Europe."
3,"While among their worst, it's still Rush","Much harder and more raw than previous efforts. Rush has always stood out in two regards: Musical Talent AND Great lyrics. Here, the lyrics are lost amid the grinding, blurring, near metal/grunge sound. They started down this path with ""Test for Echo"" and are hopefully going to drop this soon.Alex Lifeson appears to be in a mid-life crisis of sorts. Instead of his maturing guitars, he's descended to become a alternative wannabe. Geddy's voice is still strong, but on some tracks is distorted with Britney Spears-type mechanics. Peart's drums and lyrics remain as strong as ever.As said, the vocals get lost amid the ""music"" on some tracks, while others are quite pleasant and ""normal"".But still, it's Rush -- and it's a far cry better than most of the stuff out there. But for Rush, it's sub-par. Let's hope they get back to their heydey of the 70s and 80s,"
1,Blech,"If I had never heard of Rush prior to listening to this album, I'd say they weren't very good songwriters. Since I have heard of Rush, I know that they are capable of much better work than this. Compared to the whole continuum of other albums out there, this is a 1 or zero-star. Compared to other Rush albums, it barely rates 2 stars. It's hard to tell where one song ends and another starts..."
1,vapor fails,"I just bought Rush's Vapor Trails along with Deep Purple's latest, Rapture of the Deep and couldn't have had a more one sided listening experience. What a surprise.My two favorite bands seem to be going in different directions and I`m not talking about musical directions. I can't believe how AWFUL Vapor Trails is, the sound quality is just plain bad, the arrangements feel forced and the songs simply aren't good, let alone memorable. The lyrics are good, but that doesn't matter when the rest of it just sits there. I'm struggling just getting through this thing.On the other hand, Rapture of the Deep is everything Vapor Trails isn't. Great performances, fantastic songs, strong two level lyrics and good sound quality. Deep Purple sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the flow of the album is just outstanding.It's safe to say this is not Rush`s finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple`s.Vapor Trails = 1/2 starRapture of the Deep = 4 1/2 stars"
1,do i have to give them a star?,Here's a band who is basically living off the fact that they have been around for thirty years. Way to go! Thirty years of mediocrity! They try and try and fail and fail the more they go along. This is not so much a review of this album but the band as a whole. The only trails I can see are the ones left on the album covers that I use when I run out of toilet paper. Rush R.I.P. Long Live Max Webster!
1,How the mighty have fallen...,"Vapor Trails is a mess, bad sound quality, not a memorable song in the bunch. I was horrified at how bad this disc is, at first I thought something had gone wrong with my stereo system. This is one of those 'all levels peaked at once' recordings which translates into a wall of noise with very little soundstage. The high-end/clarity is missing. It's sounds like it was recorded in a garage. Neil Pert's drumming is lazy and lackluster and sounds as though it was his cheapest drum kit, again no soundstage. Geddy Lee's vocals are buried in the mix, not that it matters with a [bad] performance as this one. Alex Lifeson's raw and U2 sounding grungy guitarwork is painful to listen to. Vapor Trails reminds me of another sorry release of theirs: 'Presto', I hated that one right off. I don't what has happened to Rush, I thoroughly enjoy their earlier work in their Polygram days but this is a sad outing for what was once a very talented band...."
2,Not what I was hoping for after 5 years,"In my opinion, every album Rush put out after Power Windows, gets a little worse each time. Now, it's 2002 and this CD is terrible. Although, it does have a few songs that I can get into, most of the CD is not that great. The songs just dont have any groove to it. Just sounds like the writing could have been alot better. I plan to sell this CD as soon as I see the concert. I have every Rush CD and still love the old stuff but I sure hope the next CD is much better."
1,Most Unhappy,"This cannot be the same band that broughtus Moving Pictures,Hemispheres,Signals,Permanent Waves etc.The very reason I love Rush is because they did not soundlike anything hip or current always different and musical.Now all the keys,guitar solos and interesting bits have beenstripped out in favor of a ""now"" type sound.I was hoping the new Rush album would be a welcomebreak from all the current [stuff] but sadly it seems as ifthe're trying to sound like a mod bandWhen are the record co.s going to realise that the fans likebands like Rush,ELP Floyd etc. because they are unique.They wont gain new fans by being trendy and they'll losethe old fans into the bargain because of this very fact."
2,Disappointed,"As a long time Rush fanatic, I was hoping for something more but it's just not here. This is a very disappointing release. I don't think there is even a lead guitar break on the first 5 cuts. This sounds very much like Geddy's Solo project. Not much guitar work and pretty much just straight forward drumming. Is that really Peart ??? Geddy is still incredible on bass though."
2,Where are the great guitar solos?,This is the strangest hard rock CD I have ever listened to. 13 songs and only one of them has a guitar solo and it is a short one at that.Odder still is that this music is so powerful that it begs for guitar solos!I don't know what the boys were thinking on this one.
3,Stick with Emma Kirkby and the Academy of Ancient Music,"I wanted a new version of the Exsultate Jubilate as my cd of Emma Kirkby and the Academy of Ancient Music is 1984 release and could use a good remastering. I also find the recording of Emma Kirkby's voice a bit poor as it at times makes her harmonics sound strident. So I bought this one, but find it is lacking in life as compared to the aforementioned version. So the older version will remain my standard. I also have Kiri Te Kanawa and the London Symphony performing the Exsultate with the Vesperae Solennes Mass but find it a bit lifeless also. If you are an Emma Kirkby fan I can also recommend the Vesperae Solennes (Coronation Mass) with her and the Academy of Ancient Music (L'oiseau - Lyre, Decca D101452). It is a bit newer recording (1990) and really does her voice justice."
5,"EXCEPTIONNEL !,","Mozart aurait certainement adoré Carolyn Sampson, jolie et mutine ; je le vois bien tenir la baguette et diriger ses plus belles pages sacrées ; Robert King connat bien la belle Carolyn, pour l'avoir dirigée souvent. Comme tous ses enregistrements, c'est cousu main, cousu bien ! Profond et lumineux ! Cela change nettement des compiles bon marché ; le récital d'une grande chanteuse que l'on ne connaissait pas dans ce répertoire, subtilement choisi par le Roi Robert pour ses mélodies que l'on se prend volontiers à fredonner. Acheter et écouter les yeux fermés."
4,"Rick Vito, Pink & Black","Back in the late 80's when I first plugged in Fleetwood Mac's video Tango In The Night I was really impressed with the guitarist. I knew it wasn't Lindsey, but who was this guy with that impressive style and appearance? Rick who? Never heard of him, but never mind, this guy could really play (and sing). It was obvious even Stevie and Christy were getting into those hot riffs and since then I looked forward to his putting out some solo albums. Pink & Black was refreshingly better than I ever expected with an excellent rocker Let's Get Some Work Done, a super well done remake of original Fleetwood Mac member Peter Green's bluesy/ rocksey tune I Loved Another Woman, the solefully great blues riff Living Without You and one of the best rock-out's I've heard in a long time Trouble In Trying Times. If the album contained only these four songs, it would be worth the money, but the rest of the album is good also. The one thing that could make this a five star, longer songs."
5,Five stars based on the three tracks I've heard on KKUP,"Defintely harder rocking/bluesier than anything he's done before, and no one has the CD in stock! Demand this one at your favorite music store, and forget all your remember about Fleetwood Mac and King of Hearts. This time he's playing for real."
5,Exactly what i wanted,"THis is exactly what I wanted, and I didnt even order it special delivery, but it only took 4 days to get to me."
5,"beautiful table, wonderful doing business with you","I got fast service, and the table is beautiful. Easy to put together and fits my room to a 'T'. I will shop with these lovely people again, if i ever need furniture again. Which I hope to do in the not to distant future."
5,Great table,"Ordered this table on Tuesday, it arrived on Friday! No damage, all parts were there, easy to assemble. Color & style exactly what we expected. Solid table too."
2,"Table was fine, packaging was a nightmare!!!!","The table arrived very quickly. However, the box was beyond damaged, and I assumed that the table would be as well. I still have not entirely put it together, because I am still after 3 hours attempting to remove staples from the bottom of the table. YES, Staples. Everything was stapled to the bottom of the wood table. My kitchen is 5 steps higher than my family room, so you can see under the table from the bottom of the stairs. I can't leave strapping tape stapled to the bottom of the table. This was the WORST packaging I have ever encountered. I have bought many things off of AMAZON before, and never been this disappointed in something. The table seems nice, and I hope it does not take me three hours to put it together. I would have been easier to just go to JC Penny and spend about 30 bucks more for the same table...THANK GOD I DID NOT ORDER THE CHAIRS!!!"
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY-PLUMSTRUCK,"We received the wrong color of table that we ordered. We contacted Amazon who then directed us to the seller which is Plumstruck. Plum does not have any phone number to contact customer service. Their emails require 24 hour wait to hear back from someone at the company. Finally amazon gave us a number to contact. They are not helpful at all. We have to send the table back. Once the company has received it, they will issue a refund that will take 7-10 business days. Then at that point we have to purchase another table and hope they send the correct one.If I could give them 0 stars I would but it wont let me. We just moved into a new house and needed this table fast. It was great that we received it in 3 business days but it was the wrong color. And the box was torn to pieces. The FedEx guy could barely get it to our door because it was falling apart.DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Nice table but it's not oak,"For the money, this is a nice table. However, this is not oak and the finish is nothing as pictured. I would say it looks more maple. When I ordered this according to the description of ""cottage oak,"" silly me actually expected oak. Apparently cottage oak translates in Thailand to any lumber will do. If you are trying to match the finish to the image or the oak look to some other pieces as I was, forget it. If you are looking for a 42"" round dinnette made of a medium finish wood product, that's what you get."
1,Fair Product - Bad Company,"Pros - Semi Sturdy Table, Fairly Easy To Assemble, It's BigCons - POOR PACKAGING!!! (industrial staples used to secure legs and screws to table caused serious damage and it all comes in separate packages), company communication is non existent, picks up scratches and finger prints very easy."
3,The picture does not match the actual color.,"It is more red and dark than the picture, and not shining at all. I am very disappointed. Other than that, no other problem so far. I figure it is not worth to return it since I have to pay the shipping for return."
4,"Classic, beautiful, functional",This is a beautiful table that fits perfectly in my breakfast nook. The style is neutral and I imagine it would be pleasing in any setting. It goes well with chairs from IKEA. The only downside is that it can be tricky finding table cloths that fit.
3,Too brief,"I like Max Hasting's work although this book was far too brief. The Das Reich Division has the equal highest number of Iron Cross winners and I would have preferred their entire history rather than just the western front.I do find Hastings quite impartial though. He left me feeling rather annoyed with the Maquis and their hit & run tactics against the SS columns. The German reprisals, though horrendous, can be understood in the light of warfare values. I agree. The Germans wore uniforms and were distinguishable combatants. The Maquis worked their military tricks in disguise and expected the Germans to accept the losses.Not likely.A great read - I just wish it were a complete history. The three stars is no blight against Hastings - but against me for not buying the full historical account."
1,I do not speak French,"I have read several of Mr. Hastings' books and enjoyed all of them except this one. I feel like I missed very important information especially in chapter three. Yes, I could have looked up the French, though translating whole sentences is difficult though in some cases I did. My chain of thought was constantly interrupted trying to translate the French. It is arrogant on his part and condescending to expect the average reader to understand French in order to read his book. The practice of using French was very prevalent in fiction before 1960 and always irritated me when I was younger. It still irritates me. Would a Frenchman ignorant of English enjoy reading a French history that used English frequently, I expect not. Mr. Hastings I am impressed with your command of French, alas I do not posses your fluency."
4,Ito at the top of his game,Volume #2 of Uzumaki is every bit as macabre and gloomy as the first volume. Ito's intricate artwork is the standout here but this takes nothing away from the imaginative horrific scenarios that Ito springs forth one after another. Definitely give this series a try if you're a fan of horror and the graphic novel medium.
1,USA Chicken Stix,"This was the 2nd time that I ordered the Smokehouse USA Chicken Stix. The 1st order had USA printed right on the bag, this one had a USA sticker over the China sticker. In addition, the product looked entirely different. Obviously I am concerned. I pay more to ensure I am not feeding my ""fur kids"" products from China. If it happens again, I'll stop ordering all Smokehouse products on-line."
5,Wow,I think this game looks great! It is the first true RPG for the N-64 and from what I have read it looks really cool. And it is about time the 64 got an RPG because Quest was to lame of an RPG to even be called a game.
2,Not enjoyable for the casual gamer,"This is a boring game. I just couldn't get into it at all. The characters' conversations seem to go on FOREVER, and there's no way to break away from someone talking to you and move on. The ""battle mode"" is also something that I found to be distracting and frustrating; however, if you're a big fan of the old-style RPGs that use this feature, you'll probably like this game. On the other hand, if you want fast-paced action or thrilling gameplay, I'd stick to another title. The graphics and story line are the best parts of the game. Still, I wouldn't spend sixty bucks on ""Aidyn Chronicles"" unless you're a hard-core RPG fanatic."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"even if you're in love with classic games like me, you will hate this game. it's so sketchy and dull. even with all of the detail they tried using, the game just comes out as bland.- bare with me now - the game features an ""over the shoulder"" 3rd person view, where each character has a limited space to move and can use basic skills to attack. think of Fire Emblem, but without the squares.the game i compare this to is Quest 64. they're practically the same game as far as the style of play, yet i believe Quest 64 to be a much greater game because of it's rich color and the simple fact that it features music (this game does not.)trust me, you will not have fun playing this game."
2,"Bad, but could have been worse???","This game is bad but if you only own a N64 and you've beat the Zelda games and want another RPG this is the best your gonna get. I found this game to be too boring and tedious. Conversations in it are often far too long, with characters taking two paragraphs to say something that could have been said in one sentence. Graphics are terrible also. I noticied one reviewer constantly comparing its graphics to Final Fantasy 7's graphics. This games graphics just slightly edge out FF7's but that isnt saying very much since FF7 came out almost 5 years ago. I cant really remember if Aidyn even had music so it must have been pretty bad... Battles are annoying, traveling is annoying.... Only reason I didnt give this a one is because the plot is kinda original....."
1,Dont waste your time or money,I'll make this short. Don't waste your time or money on this game. The graphics make everything flat. The story is rediculous. I thought a players guide would help the game. It doesn't. The fighting is very boring. Most of the game is spent walking from one town to the next. This usually takes 3-5 hours. Thats a lot of walking. If I were aloud to swear in this review i know a few more words to describe this game other than a piece of ...
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I rented this yesterday, and it's absolute .... The gameplay is gawky, the main character moves very slowly, and combat is very stupid and hard to figure out. You have to start the whole game over when you die unless you save, but then again, isn't ""new journal entry added"" SUPPOSED to mean the game saved in most RPGs? The graphics weren't very good either. Go buy Zelda."
3,Try again!,"It was a long time in coming but it wasn't worth the wait. The graphics are good and the story line is great, but unfortunately the turn by turn battles are repetitive, tedious and boring. What happened? There were a bunch of good RPGs for SNES. I've waited long enough for Nintendo to get their RPG act together for the 64. It's just not going to happen. Thank goodness my husband gave me a PS2 for my birthday."
5,One of the best RPGs,"This game is one of the best games for n64- by far.So what if its extreamly hard(I've had it for two years now, not even close)?The gameplay is great!You run around and talk to people like normal games, but when you run into an enemy, you go in to a complety different mode.Based on you states,some of you four charecters can move or attack.You have a certain space to move in to attack enemys.The storyline is complacated, the game play never gets old or repetative,over all, this is a great game.I recommend it."
5,I don't understand those bad reviews,"This is my first Linux installation my PC, the installation was smooth exept that i needed to download drivers for the Nvidia graphic card .Suse is very stable i allmost forgath the crushes and unstability of the whole system , too bad there is no DirectXsupport well i still keep Win for Gaming.I allmost forgeth :PIV 2.4256 RAM40 GB128MB Nvidia GC"
1,"It is very old 2004 release, incompatible and lacking","This ancient, abandoned, unsupported version of suse is more than half of decade old. Beside it will not work on any of today's computers because drivers aren't there. It is nothing like Linux of today. It has outdated everything from kernel to GUI, it will not run most of software as most require modern kernel and modern GUI. Just skip it. Get current openSUSE (version 11.3 on a moment of writing)."
1,Crashed my PC and lost all my data,"I am now typing at a friends computer thanks to Suse Linux 9.2....If you think this is better than Windows, don't fall for it, they must be paid on here to write these bogus 5 star reviews. First off, I followed the instructions, then I proceeded to a machine that will not boot. When I try to reload windows it comes up to a blinking cursor on the screen. ARRGG!In the end I purchased Windows XP Home SP2 and had it professionally installed and it works perfectly. No for the rest of my data is long gone. Very bitter story and waste of money on this Linux rip-off."
1,Very unstable and full of bugs,"This has to be the worst software ever made, it locks up, causing me to have to hit the power button to get the machine to boot back up. Plus, there are NO multi-media applications to play content such as Windows media, no deal it does not work. Applications, no decent Office suites other than Open Office which is like using notepad in Windows.You can purchase Windows XP Professional OEM version for around $89 and not have to upgrade for years, with Suse Linux they want you to pay $90+ every 6 months or so, for 'FREE' software you can download for free and install. Something is wrong here, paying for something that is free, come on folkes move along and have a clue.Linux has no support, has no life cycle, constant upgrading because the pervious 50 versions did not work. Don't FALL for this scam, stay away from Suse."
1,All of this software is available for FREE off the internet,"This is ALL free software, paying $90+ for it isa RIP-OFF!Do your self a favor and just run Windows XP Professional,it works, has software applications and hasFUNCTIONALITY!"
2,Problems with network,"Although SUSE 9.2 appears to be a well designed product with many useful features, I'm unable to get it to function as a DHCP client on my network, so I can't get onto the Internet or access any local network resources. There is perhaps some subtle tweak here that might get it to work but after spending an hour on the telephone with one of SUSE's support staff neither he nor I was able to find it.After reviewing some of the posts on various Linux forums, networking problems appear to be common with this release. Similar problems were not experienced by posters with 9.1. This is a pretty serious failing and I strongly recommend that you stay away from this product until these issues are resolved."
1,Shameful: This a Half Size!,This product does not - unless I am overlooking it - indicate the number of ounces of Lori food they are selling.I ordered it and got an amount that was a small fraction of the identical food that I have ordered from othervendors. What size is this? What I got was a small container whereas the picture is identical to the muchlarger container that I got from other venders. Shameful!
2,"Hole-y Kimono, Batman.","When I shell out thirty bucks for a bath-robe, I don't expect the armpit seems to rip apart a month later. I'm not exactly thrilled about the robe not closing right either. I don't think it has to do with one's weight - it's a big enough robe - I just think the fabric cut of the robe is wrong. I guess I'll have to shell out fifty bucks or more for a decent bath robe."
3,Hush Your Mouth Ohio Man Yuh Jus Doh Know Dub,Is only a true reggae fan an avid listener would appreciate the contrasting styles of several DJ's on one cd. Great album consisting of dub and dancehall to your leisure. Ohio man if yuh had some West Indian or Caribbean blood yuh might ah ketch it. Maybe next time but open yuh ears please.
5,SUCH A DEAL,WOW ALL I CAN SAY IS IT'S GREAT AND THE PRICE CAN'T BE BEAT..... AND BY THE WAY IT LOOKS GREAT ON MY KITCHEN COUNTER.... AM GOING TO BUY FOR MY FRIENDS IT IS INDEED A GREAT DEAL
4,Queen Latifah's tracks are grand.,"After hearing her on this album and seeing her work in the film ""Chicago,"" I think it's past time a record producer talked Queen Latifah, rap star and actress, into doing a strict jazz album. I've heard others compare her work on this album to that of Pearl Bailey. Her voice is so rich, and, singing the blues, you can hear both amusement and pain in her tones. In fact, her recording of ""Lush Life"" is so accomplished that you do a double-take, thinking this cannot be the ""U.N.I.T.Y."" rapper. But it is.The rest of the album, alas, is less thrilling. Danny DeVito's a good enough vocalist, but he just sounds like someone who could wow people at a karaoke bar, little more than that.The other tunes, minus the Fenton score tracks that are heavy on piano and light on mood, are jazz and pop standards you could find on any number of albums.But Latifah, singing her heart out and winning over new fans, triumphs."
5,"AWESOME,AWESOME,AWESOME, THAT SAYS IT ALL!!!!!!!","Queen Latifah is the bomb! The woman sings with feeling from deep in her soul. It's also great to hear Etta James. This CD has just become my favorite. If you have seen the movie, you will understand how the music corralates. Heart, feeling and soul, great makings for this disc."
5,Brilliant music from an excellent film,"Buy this CD..even without seeing the film, which would be your loss...Buy this CD...I read about the process by which the film was made and the music was literally playing DURING the making of the film on the set...not tacked on later or simply scored. The synergy of music and image is remarkable for the emotional interplay it sets up. Brilliant.Queen Latifah is outstanding. A remarkable talent. But why Clark Anderson is not a HUGE star just mystifies me. Incredible voice..he even wrote the song...AND he is a handsome guy too! He can even ACT. Where is he? Devito is certainly capable and does a nice job with his song but the other tunes on the disc are worth double the price. Buy this CD...It is in my top ten all time...and I have several thousand CD's...Strong enough review for you?"
5,Yes 5 stars,"If you like jazz and easy listening this album is for you. And who really blew me away was Queen Latifa. I had no idea she could sing like that. She should be doing more jazz songs, she has such a pure voice. I play this over and over in my car I can't get enough. She's up there with Lena Horne in my book. Also, Danny DeVito sings on this, too, he is not a singer but it works! Enjoy!"
5,A Diamond in the Rough,"The only way to truly enjoy the music on this cd is to dim the lights, light some candles, and just listen to the incredible energy that sweeps you away from all reality. With its beautifully written lyrics and the amazing artists who bring them to life, Living Out Loud is rare jewel of an album."
2,Not a great bargain,"The instructor talks too much beside the point: the instructions should be clearer and more succinct. While nice, the moves offered are few, and two of the sections deal with merengue. Although merengue armwork and patterns are frequently converted to salsa, why teach them AS merengue on a salsa DVD? To fill in space, the DVD simply starts over again with track # 1: the actual time on the DVD devoted to instruction is too short."
4,Problem programming but my daughter loves it now!!!!!,"We had a problem installing with the CD-Rom. Fisher Price was not very helpful. Their solution was just to send a new CD-Rom. However, after I got off the phone with him I read a review (also listed here, read comments posted to review for exactly what to do with your computer) here and it helped me figure out how to download the info to the dog. The first time it FINALLY said my daughter's name she was so excited! She has been waiting since Christmas for it to work right and I couldn't get through to Fisher Price and didn't read the review until today. It's really cute and she couldn't believe it when the dog knew it's own name too!"
2,Puppy Grows & Knows,"The product does not include the USB cable and no where on the box is this noted. Will be very disappointing to any child opening as a gift and not being able to play w/it. I called Fisher-Price and complained and was told that any printer cable would work. NOT SO! Please be aware that toys have a notated section on the boxes that batteries, etc are required. This does not! Another $10. and gas mileage spent to locate a cable."
2,Way too much for Way too little,"Impressed by what grandmas were saying about this product and all it could do, I gave into my daughter's Christmas wish list and bought the dog. Apparently, earlier versions knew about the child's friends, places, and other cool stuff. The new CD only allowed you to choose a name from a pre-determined list for both the puppy and child. There were no other options. The fisher price website was useless to find out why we couldn't access anything else. The first day my daughter played with it for about 5 minutes as it did very little. The next day it was more interactive, but our family's interest was to only bang the puppy on the head to try to make it grow. Squawkers McCaw and Snugglekins Monkey were much more enjoyable."
5,Fur Real Kittens,"This is such a cute toy!! My daughter fell ion love with it the first second she saw it. The way it looks, feels and acts like a real kitty is amazing!! This is a must for the pet lover in your household!"
5,BUY IT!!!!,"Don't buy the cat,buy the kitten! kittens are only $30.00,they don't break when you move their head,there MUCH smaller,there cuter and lighter.cats are $60.00,they break if you drop them from your arms,there hard,there too expensive,there head falls of even if you try and turn the head! don't buy it!buy the kitten there worth it!"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"MY DAUGHTERS ONLY REQUEST FOR CHRISTMAS WAS A FUR REAL PET.TO MY DISMAY AFTER OPENING THE GIFT FROM HER FATHER (THE FURPET) IT DID NOT WORK FOR EVEN TWO MINUTES. I CAN NOT IMAGINEMAKING A TOY THAT DOES NOT PROVE KID FRIENDLY. WITH BRAND NEW BATTERIES, IT DOES NOT MOVE ITS HEAD. IT DOES MAKE A NOISE BUT NOT TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A MEOW. I AM SO DISSATISFIED - HOWEVER SHE DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE IT UP BECAUSE IT IS FROM HER FATHER."
1,Terrible battery life.,These made it to the bottom of the toy box pretty quickly. Four AAA batteries are just not enough to keep these working long enough for any kind of fun. A shame.
2,Awesome but no color photos... only black and white! Very Disappointed... :-(((,"Of course the text is the same. But I am very disappointed by the fact that this book is completely black and white. All photos are black and white and make them difficult to clearly see! Of course I shouldn't moan because the text and information are the same as in a color version. But my disappointment still stands especially considering that some other reviews on here mention ""Great Color Photos"" which of course, I got none of..."
4,Good book for Cherokee Owners,"Starts at a high-level performance upgrade by explaining the upgrade and what it can provide to the vehicle. As you read on, you understand the difficulty and the details to complete the upgrade as well what to watch out for..."
5,It is a great book,It is a great book for anybody that wants to get in to 4x4 off road and to invest on upgrades to the jeep XJ without putting parts or money that may not preformed to the type of off roding that they want to reach. It is very detail and simple to fallow.
4,Great investment for the new (or old) Cherokee XJ owner.,"Older vehicles are always a problem when it comes to finding information and parts. Add to that the difficulty new owners sometimes have making good decisions about modifications (like lifts, for example), and you can readily see the need for a book like the one written by Eric Zappe and produced by CarTech(R).This book will certainly not replace a repair manual - you'll want one of those, maybe even the factory manual - but this book will discuss options and show you alternatives, things the repair manuals are not good at. Others have said it before me: if you own a 1984 - 2001 Jeep Cherokee XJ, then you need to own this book."
4,High Perfomance Jeep Cherokee XJ Builders Guide,"Interesting read, good place to start, I'm a novice builder so perhaps I got more from it than others. I would recommend it to anyone considering modifying their XJ. Wish there was a book like this for ZJ/WJs."
5,Great Information!!!,"This magazine is an informative well written guide to building up your XJ. It gives pros and cons for each modification, and reasons for doing the mods in the first place. It may not have everything, but it is a great place to start and may save a few builders from doing hasty mods and wasting time and money they could save for what they really want long term. You can't beat it for the price! I recommend this product to all XJ owners new and old who want to start modifying their XJ, or are not sure how to get their XJ to the next level."
4,Jeep Performance Book,"Well I waited a long time before ordering this book and when I finally got I was very happy. Overall a great book for building rock-crawler's. Some things I would like to see in the future (if there is a future): desert runner mods, more performance options for the 4.0 HO engine, more on the NP242."
4,"Save money later, buy this book now.","I purchased this book and have found the advise in it to be sound. I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering the build up of his Jeep Cherokee (XJ). There is an appendix in the back with a list of on-line wholesalers that is worth having. I also recommend joining NAXJA as this (Jeep Cherokee only) on line community is very helpful in assisting you on what to do, how to do it, and were to get it."
5,Essential,"If you are thinking of building your Cherokee, this guide is essential. It plans out options, steps and plenty of excellent photographs. This guide will make you an informed purchaser of aftermarket parts for your XJ."
5,Outstanding,"The second outstanding Skeeter Skelton book. Pricey now, but an outstanding collection of stories for real men and women, or anyone who appreciates real men and classic American guns. Hunt down a copy."
2,does not provide savvy experiences,"The usefulness of this book is not like the size of it. It does not provide step by step instruction on how to create an online ebay store nor how to sell on ebay. This book mentions some concepts such as dropselling, consignment, but it doesnot show me where to source electronic merchandize. Although the book itemizes a bunch of wholesalers, none of them provide useful products and sell them at discount. Therefore, the books does not help readers to gain cost advantage. I wish there is any books showing how to minimize handling and shipping cost so that I can offer customers free shipping as Amazon.com and some Ebay sellers do."
4,Recycled,"Made in EU in 2001, Serial# SMD-CD-370, Playing Time 85:08This 2CD set is basically an abridged version of the ""Then & Now"" 2CD set (which clocks in at 126:42), and omits the 40 minutes or so of material recorded at the 1st California Jam concert.I suggest you go and read the various reviews attached to the ""Then & Now"" set, which you can get for a few dollars more...To me, the decision is a no-brainer (and while you're there, don't forget to add it to your shopping cart!)"
2,"Chalkboard is useless, despite spending A great deal of time ""seasoning"" the board the board, i","Puppet theater is cute, however I wish I had purchased the Melissa and Doug puppet theater. We cannot write on chalkboard, even after spending a great deal of time trying to ""season"" the board. The Melissa and Doug puppet theater gives kids more of a hidden puppet play space, which this theater does not offer. The clock on the theater fell apart after a couple weeks as well, although we fixed it. This theater does offer a play ""ledge"" which the kids enjoy, however think twice before ordering this over another product."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I am satisfied with this product, but was very disappointed that I was deceived about the shipping. I ordered this about 2 weeks before Christmas but did not receive it until 12/27. Since it was a Christmas gift for my 7 year old granddaughter, I had to explain why her gift wasn't here but other kids' gifts were! Needless to say, I was very angry with ""Little Wonders"" company."
3,"Great product, horrible shipping","I bought the green (smaller) version of this feeder, and it came through the mail fine, but this one broke in the mail twice. It is a beautiful feeder, but the packaging is horrible. There was foam around the top and bottom, but nothing around the glass to keep it from breaking in transit. After the first one broke, I asked for another to be sent, and it was broken as well when it arrived. The green version has worked out wonderfully for me. It is very beautiful."
4,Excellent - An Accurate Portrayal,"I found Astor's book to be an excellent read. He lets the soldiers tell their own stories and does not exclude any of the blood-and-gut comments. You get an accurate portrayal of what the invasion must have been like for the soldier, e.g., like what you see in ""Saving Private Ryan"" - the blown-apart body parts, limbless bodies, etc. The book covers, quite well, the soldiers at home (before the war), their experiences in training, the trip over to France, their battles on the beach, and a follow-up. I certainly recommend his book to anyone. Any of Gerald Astor's books are good.I did find one item unusual: several times I found myself thinking, ""I remember a scene like this in 'The Longest Day' movie. I asked myself if Astor saw the movie first, then decided to write the book. Nevertheless, just a small observation. I would certainly read this book again!"
3,Silliness...,"Well, it is what it is... It's a soundtrack as advertised.The same songs that appeared on the movie and a few sound clips from some of the scenes.It's OK. I bought it just to have another piece of TPB swag.Watch out for the s***hawks!"
3,TPB Movie Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is OK. However, it's missing at least one song that I know of from the movie...Heavy Metal Love is conspicuously missing."
4,hard working,"Son has since outgrown..but from a very young age loved playing with this, and as motor skills grew, the toy presented new opportunities. Feet are reversible, so one side is for really small kids and the other for older kids (up to around 3 and a half). Perhaps a little overpriced, but proved to be very durable."
3,Tiny Love Developlay Double-Sided Activity Center,"This toy has both good and bad features. The colors and activities are good, but it would be nice to find a toy that does not have flashing lights. In low light, it's a strobe light and, in my opinion, too bright for any benefit gained. In fact, am wondering what the benefit really is in so many toys having the flashing light features....this seems to be the trend in toys available today. Anyone out there know the answer to this?"
5,An unapologetic pro,"I really enjoyed this book. Teddy Atlas lays it all out on the table, and holds nothing back with his boxers, his enemies, or the reader. His world is black and white, and he never falters when it comes to his own integrity. You may like him, you may not, but you won't question where he is coming from. I have used some of his philosophies with my own kids, particularly his take on fear. The guy sounds like someone you would love to have a beer with, but definitely not someone you would want to tick off. He's a little high on himself, but I think those are the only types that survive in the world of Boxing.The book gives some insight into Mike Tyson, George Foreman, and others, but not a tremendous amount, so don't buy it thinking you will get the inside scoop on the whole boxing world. Its more of a singular perspective of a tough guy who reaches the pinnacle of his profession without selling out."
4,A definite struggle to become a man,"The ESPN Friday Night Fight's analyst writes a good book about an interesting life. Atlas grew up in a love-deprived home and took his anger out by rebelling against his parents and becoming part of the criminal element.After some brushes with the law, he tried his hand at being a boxer before falling into his role of trainer.The author tells some good stories and adds some insights into the psyche of a fighter.A good book, perhaps the only question I have with the book is Atlas's seeming thoughtlessness towards his family. He tells of a few times when he was offered good money contracts to perform duties and knocked them back, only to be financially struggling. This is all ok if he were single, but he had to support a wife and two young kids, I wonder if he shouldn't have put his principles aside for the sake of making his family financially stable."
5,A Warrior's Handbook,"Teddy Atlas wrote the ideal book for men struggling to find the truth about fear, loyalty, friendship, honor, commitment and even forgiveness. Being a ""stand-up"" guy has never been easy and most have gone the easy route by acting tough, instead of honestly confronting and over coming one's fears. Atlas isn't a preachy lightweight, because every chapter smacks the reader in the head with the powerful truth that we all have our fears and look for the easy way out of difficult situations. His advice comes not from some pinhead with a psychology PhD, but from a life full of terrible irony.This book should be required reading for every young guy embarking on life's dangerous journey."
4,"Entertaining Book - but just Good, not Great","I bought this book because I've always been intrigued by Teddy Atlas and was recently reminded of him because Eric Mangini, head coach of the Jets, uses Teddy Atlas to motivate the team.I enjoyed this book because it reads like Teddy is sitting next to you telling you the story. While some of the themes get a bit repetitive and he can aome across as self important sometimes, he's definitely a compelling character and worth the read."
5,Atlas: From the Streets to the Ring,"Good,honest,and enjoyable reading. Mr. Atlas has always been a favorite of mine on Friday Night Fights. He talks from experience and I would strongly recommend this book for any boxing fan."
4,Fairly Decent Bio....,"....about someone you never heard of. If you want to know what boxing is relly about, then it's a must. Teddy Atlas has some fascinating things to say about the nature of fear that makes the whole book worthwhile."
5,Great read,"I actually went to high school with Teddy. I am not a close friend, but know him from Staten Island where we both grew up. I have spoken to Teddy several times over the years.This book was a great read. I could not put it down until it was finished. Helped that I grew up in the same place of course, but this book is a great introspective on Teddy's interesting and unique life. His insight and honesty on boxing is worth the purchase. Teddy does not sugar-coat anything.Loved it, give it a read! I highly recommend this for any fan of boxing or anyone who wants to read about growing up with challenges and coming out on top.Congrats Teddy for creating such a great book."
3,Quality German Reggae,"While I haven't heard this entire album, I do have the Heat of the Night single and have heard a couple of the other songs. These other songs are alright, but Heat is a very bumpin' tune that will have you up dancing - reggae with a strong hip-hop flavor. An album worth getting."
5,"Gentleman, German Hot Reggae","Gentleman has been one of my favorites from the 1st time I heard his music. You will NOT ever be disappointed in any CD of his.I just saw him at Bob Marley Day 2005 in Long Beach, Ca and he also sounds just as good in person. His lyrics and Music are so great and his message is one of truth and love."
3,FOOLS,"Gentleman cd's are hard to find because he is from GERMANY.....this album reminds me back to 99....haven't listen to it for years......but i just discovered ""journey to jah"" and i like it a lot. way better than this one.....but still this one is worth to check out!"
5,The must-have upgrade for a digital camera/camcorder,Film often and carry a big (memory) stick. This makes a sony digital camera/camcorder much nicer to use--you can snap away all day without running out of memory space.
5,Just as good as more expensive Sony sticks,"I bought two of these and use them to carry MP3s for my Sony Clie, and haven't had any problems. Great price, I would definitely recommend them!"
3,Not fully compatible,"I purchased this with my SONY P9 digital camera. It works fine with the camera. However, it does not work with the memory stick slot on my SONY VAIO (RX-750) computer. The memory stick from SONY works without any problem. I even called LEXAR support. They insist that their memory stick is fully compatible and told me that I should call SONY to find out where the computer is compatible with LEXAR memory stick!If you are not using SONY computer, this may be a good alternative. It's not for me."
3,Science Fiction,"This is the story of an ordinary man who dares to challange the concept of genetic perfection. This is the time of the future where genetic perfection is used to determine those people who may sire an offspring. Ethan Hawke is classed as an""In-Valid"" who assumes the identity of one of the genetic elite so that he can pursue his dream of space travel with the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. A week before he is due to blast off he becomes a prime suspect in a murder case; he falls in love with a collegue(Uma Thurman). Thus, pursued by a relentless investigator and his collegue begining to suspect his deception, he has the feeling that his dream is beginning to unravel."
5,A must-read for anyone in Catholic pastoral ministry,"Fr. Francis's book is one of the clearest, most comprehensive and comprehensible treatments on the subject of inculturation (most easily defined as the arena where liturgy and culture meet and interact) to be found anywhere. Although no one could fault its academic clarity, it reads like a story rather than a textbook. Not simply for parishes dealing with multicultural issues, this book examines the interplay of culture and worship throughout history, offering new insights and practical advice for helping our liturgical celebrations both reflect and redeem the ever-shifting culture of the people of God."
3,infusion jar,We thought it came with the stand but it did not. The jar is good size but glass is thin. It takes a long time to fill a glass because the liquid comes out slow.
3,Nice but spigot is too far up,"I wish it was more design. I've seen others with fruit etched into the jar. The spigot is so far up, so there's always a quart of juice in the bottom that you can't get to unless you tilt is. Also the spigot should be changed if kids are going to use it. You can the turn it too far. If it comes off, then you have a juice all over the place. Also, very delicate. Don't use a metal spoon to stir. If using it for juice, make it in a different container."
1,Poor design,Ordered this for a party to infuse citrus with cold water. Spigot ran so poorly that unless you took the risk of opening it all the way (resulting in a stream of water going every where) it took over a minute to fill one glass.
1,Don't do it!!!,When my jar came in I checked it out and it was damaged. Chipped glass around the spigot. Customer service stinks. Will not send a pick up for return. Multiple attempts to contact. Sent picture. They said that was normal. Offered a discount. Don't want damaged jar. Only sent return authorization after filing complaint. Return came with undertones that if jar came in damaged they wouldn't credit. Jar was already damaged. Advise to future buyers. DON'T DO IT!!!
4,Hypnotic and profound,"Combine the sounds of a halucinated forge in the amniotic sac of a fetal succubus with Gamelan music and you have something approaching the formula of this album. If that sounds like your cup of tea, then by all means imbibe of it. This is a truly profound piece of ambient music that elevates the genre."
3,Not One of My Favorites by Dan Gibson,"I've been listening to the various ""Solitude"" CD's by Dan Gibson for many years, and have found that most of them help me to relax, and are great to meditate with. However, I did not find this to be the case with ""Garden in Provence"".As I listened to this particular CD, I was reminded of ""elevator music"", which I just don't care for. However, there were a few ""good"" songs, which is why I gave it 3 stars.It all comes down to musical tastes... So, if you find ""elevator music"" relaxing, you may want to give this CD a try."
5,pure heaven!,"I keep ordering this as I've never found bath salts this wonderful! Reminds me of being in a forest, it's very green in the water, but the smell is pure heaven!"
2,Look for other sources,This biography was writen in the late 1800's. The author has a significant problem with hero worship. The book is not in chronological order and is quite frankly a difficult read. I would look at other sources if Baden Powell is of interest
5,Excellent first book!,"We purchased this book for our 4 1/2 month old daughter who showed no interest in any of the books we had tried to read her. We had never made it through more than 2-3 pages of any other book. The first time we read Pip's story we made it through the entire book! Our daughter is now 6 months old and we read this book to her everyday along with several other Busy Bugz books. She still loves it, and she even helps me hold the book when I read it to her! Highly recommend this one for infants - the illustrations are fantastic, the rhymes are catchy and they are the perfect length for infant and toddler attention spans."
5,Great Toy for the 8 - 14 month old...,"As a child care provider for over 20 years,there are not many ""new"" toys that catch my eye. A client brough this toy with her little one on the first day of care. After day one I was sold...I went and purchased one to have at all times for my other little ones. It keeps them busy and amused at nap time, lunch time while I'm preparing..and just about any time it's available to them. It's easy to clean with a damp cloth. A great toy...and I'm on my way to purchase another!..so I have two!"
4,Intoxicating and absorbing!!!,"Getting into the heart of the minds of these late 20's yuppies and their lives, consisting of all aspects of the high life was intoxicating! I love it! Although the characters were clearly amoral, this book really reaches into the core of what makes up a corrupt world and people who corrupt it. This book was outstandingly written, although not terribly long, really put the point across! Right on!"
4,"Short, But With A Long Message","Really great!!! This book may be a little on the short side, but it really packs a punch and goes a long way! You'd be surprised, but a lot of books you read that are long and drawn out, really have no meaning or essence to them. ""Black Tie & White Skies"" however, really has a moral to it. If you want to read a story with a good message that can be applied to life, then read this book!"
5,I Give It A Big Hurrah!!!!!,"A very awesome book!!! Once you start reading it, you never want to put it down! Very descriptive and well written. You feel totally immersed in the lives of the characters. It's as if you are actually taking part in the story as you read it. I hope Mr. Lesko writes another one soon."
1,Poor Taste and Not Entertaining,"Although the idea of a farting dog is not appealing to me, I got this book for my 4-year old son thinking that at least he would find it amusing. Nope. I found it very distasteful and my son thought it boring. He would not even let me finish reading it to him (even with sound effects - I really tried!) I understand the premise is that the dog farts, but an entire book about the dog farting at all times, in all places, etc.! With illustrated fart gas clouds around the page! The picture of the veterinarian inspecting the dog's rear-end with a fart cloud escaping in his face was just poor taste, not funny, nor was the fart which propelled the dog across the room. I thought I could handle it (I have 5 brothers) but could not find the humor, and did not work for my son either. My recommendation: Pass on this book."
5,Hilarious!!,"Man, this book is great!...when we saw this book. It was a blessing for me b/c I really needed a good laugh. Walter comes home with two little kids and he's has an extreme gastrious condition. Yeah, that means he passes gas uncontrollably. His parents plan to take him back to the pound. The night before he goes, the children plead with Walter not to fart any more. Poor Walter tries his best not to fart, but it just seems nearly impossible, especially after he eats a whole box of low fart dog biscuits. ... It is a very touching story with great pictures and the William Kotzwinkle has such a way with words, you'll laugh after reading every page. hey-check out the little yellow spider on every page!!"
1,Walter the farting dog,"For heaven's sake, we have enough trouble keeping our three-year-old grand nephew within some sense of decorum. We would expect Amazon not to foster this uncivil language. Yes, flatulence will make children, and most adults, laugh. So will any number of other socially unacceptable, coarse behaviors and language. Amazon does too good a job to allow this tasteless, uncouth language to be distributed to pre-school children. This is a series! We are very disappointed.REF:Walter the Farting Dog"
1,Horrible little book,"This book is a nightmare. Funny? No, please have adults sunk to this level and do they intend to teach children that this type of thing is acceptable? Oh, it's just awful. :("
1,This is not a childrens book,"Maybe it's okay for adults with a 4-8 year old mentality, but not for children.Having just spent a lot of time at a focus group in which mother's discussed what to use in a child's mouth when he or she uses an obscenity, (soap seems to be the flavor of the month), to find a book with an obscenity in the title makes me cringe. How does one teach a child that certain words should not be used when the publishing industry not only uses them but sticks them in the title.William Kotzwinkle, you should be ashamed of yourself. Or are you and your publisher that desperate for money?I believe this book should be moved to the adult section/humor where it would be more appropriate."
5,Delightful Story of Redemption & Tolerance,Children from two to 102 can enjoy and appreciate this book. The story teaches valuable lessons of tolerance and redemption. Colorful and entertaining illustrations. Everyone I've introduced this book to has just LOVED it!
4,unfortunately we all fart,I found this at a thrift store in CA. For 50 cents I could not pass it up. I have since found 4 of the 5 Walter books in the series. This one is probably the best of them all.
4,walter,I bought this product for my five year old grandson who thought it was funny and who will learn to read a little more as well as laugh a lot.
1,Mutated Zombies for sure,"I can see people's objections about farting and the storyline, that didn't get me so much as the illustrations. One reviewer said they look like mutated zombies and I agree. All the people's skin was green and they had bizarre expressions on their face.To set the record straight, they tried to get this book published for 10 years so it was probably not a knock off, but I'm not surprised the story hasn't been done before. I found it predictable. I'm surprised it's a best seller.I'm glad I checked this book out from the library and didn't buy it. I definitely don't plan on showing it to my children. The illustrations are just too disturbing."
2,STOLEN STORY !!,"I came across a book called ""Dog Breath"" by Dav Pilkey. It's the SAME EXACT story as ""Walter"" but the dog has bad breath. This dog also fends off burglars and is saved from being given away. I was horrified. This book was published in 1994. Walter in 2001. Way to steal someone else's story for your own profit!!!"
3,My 3 sons would give this book 5 stars!!!!,"Our librarian suggested this for my sons, who were then 5,7, and 8. They loved it. I was glad to return it to the library. We had our laughs with it, then got it out of the house quickly! My sons spend too much time as it is talking about bodily functions. I don't consider myself uptight but there are some things you just don't need to dwell on. Still, my boys enjoyed it so I gave it 3 stars."
5,Laughed until I cried,"The title caught my eye at the book store and when I started to read this book I laughed until I cried! I kept snorting with laughter right there in the store. Walter is an average dog with an unfortunate problem.....gas. This book is sure to delight all who read it. The adults(?) I work with also got a kick out of the illustrations(we played Find the Spider). It also has such a sweet message...we all have a place in this world, a talent all our own. A wonderful book that is sure to delight all readers."
4,Poor Walter,"Poor Walter, the dog, has a nasty case of canus inflatus, that makes him pass gas on a regular basis. When his new owners discover this problem, the parents want to take Walter back to the pound. The doctors have already tried everything they could to cure poor Walter of his ""problem"" but nothing seems to work.Two robbers visit Walter's house and Walter saves the families things, earning him a place in the new family, but not for long...The only thing remotly strange about the book, other than the storyline, were the strange hairstyles Walter's female owner sported. I felt let reaching inside the book to give her a hairbrush."
4,5 year old loves it,"I bought this as a gift for my 5 year old nephew, expecting he would like it. Boy was I right. He asked to read it 4 times the first day. The only thing is some pages are full of text. That said, the story isn't just about fart jokes - there actually is a hidden moral story too."
5,Oh. My...God....HILARIOUS,"Let me first say that I don't think I would buy this book for my toddler - she's already a bit fart-obsessed for a kid who's not even two yet, and I don't think I want to encourage her to walk around saying the word ""fart"" any more than I can help.That said...holy God, this book is funny. I mean, really funny. The illustrations add to the almost surreal level of silliness. I read this book while browsing in a book shop and I was in tears by the end of it. I tried to read a bit of it to my wife because she wanted to know what was so funny, and I couldn't get through more than a sentence without howling with laughter. I would consider this as a gag gift for an adult friend with an off-color sense of humor more than I would view it as appropriate for children."
5,a great way to get off your high horse,"Great book!!!!!!!!!!!I love laughing while rolling on the floor. I'm sure it's offensive to the arts and croissant crowd, but even though they don't like for non-blue-bloods to know it, they fart too. This book was a great way unwind at the end of the day"
5,This is a great series!!,"I just love this series of books. I give them to my great nephew, he loves them!!! He and his father get the biggest kick out of them when they read them together. I also love the fact that they do have a good message. That no matter what our faults, all creatures need to be loved and cared for for who and what they are. I plan on having and giving the whole set of these books :-)"
4,Walter is endearing for young readers,"This is one of daughter's favorite books. It is very cute without being too crude (besides he is just a dog)...But Walter ends up saving the day with his ""fart"" and all is well that ends well."
3,no fur on Walter,I thought I was purchasing a book I saw in a catalog that I had tried to order but they were out of stock. It was the same book except the catalog edition had a furry spot in the middle of the book that when pushed gave the reader sound effects. It showed through to each page so the child could push it each time a page was turned. The books I recieved were not only more expensive but had no sound effects. It was still a cute story and 2 of the 3 children I gave it to had not read it.
2,Unnecessarily Crude,"The book is funny, and I have no doubt kids will laugh, but I think parents and librarians alike ought to think twice. The topic is hardly a moral issue, but it brings up unncessary crude discussion. My children will not be reading this.On the plus side, it is one of those awkward ones that needs to be discussed. This book, relying on camp humor, isn't the place to start.I do not recommend ""Walter, the Farting Dog.""Anthony Trendl"
2,Rip-off?,"I'd echo the comment of another reviewer--the story is cute, the illustrations charming, but the plot is a blatant rip-off of Dav Pilkey's 1994 book, Dog Breath. William Kotzwinkle is one of my favorite authors and usually comes up with original and imaginative story lines, so it's a disappointment to see that he's (intentionally or unintentionally) copied this one from another author."
1,"Dumb, Dumb, Dumb (Not to Mention Crude)","Ah, yes -- the coarsening of American society continues. There was a time not so long ago when children were actually discouraged from engaging in potty humor because it was believed -- how silly can you get? -- that the goal was to raise mature people with a sense of class. Now, we're told we should make poopie jokes with our kids and laugh right along. ""But kids laugh at this stuff anyway, so what's the harm? Don't be such a stick in the mud!"" Funny, parenting used to be all about demanding more than gutter behavior from children and teaching them how to have manners, regardless of what they snickered about with their friends. One reviewer definitely got it right when he called this book ""low-brow."" Funny, I always thought that was a BAD thing. Great . . . just one more step in the process of creating a generation of low-class idiots."
2,Funny but... it's been done before and better,"I have never heard of ""Flatulent Fred"" (and neither has Amazon); however, Dog Breath!: The Horrible Trouble With Hally Tosis by Dav Pilkey (copywritten in 1994), as another reviewer mentioned, is esentially the same story (only with bad breath as opposed to gas) with a little better sense of writing and a much better sense of visual illustration. In my opinion, the only appealing visual in Walter is Walter himself. The people are freakishly rendered and a visual detraction from the story. Any book that makes children happy is okay by me and Dav Pilkey has created many books that children of all ages enjoy and seems to be doing pretty well on his own.That said I think it is a shame that his book is overlooked for this inferior version."
5,A lesson to be learned here....,"Not only is the book funny and entertaining, there IS an underlying message here. There is good to be found in everyone.Poor Walter, a fat, rather ugly dog has a terrible gas problem. And while Father wants to take Walter to the pound, the children try everything possible to solve Walter's flatulence.After all fails, Father decides that if he can't restrain himself, Walter WILL go to the pound. Walter saves the night when two burgulars break into the house and Walters fart disgusts them so much, they flee, and subsequently get captured by the police.Father decides to overlook Walters indescretions and allows him to stay."
4,It's a fun story for the kids.,"We bought the plush toy along with the book. as we read the book to the kids (age 4) they can see, and hear, Walter in action :)they love it."
5,Great Fun,"Walter the Farting DogMy 5 year old grandson loves us to read this book. He laughs at the story, and delights in finding the hidden pictures of the spiders. It holds his attention, and he won't let me skip even one word!Happy Grandma"
2,Copycat,"This book is very funny, but if any of you have read Dog Breath by Dav Pilkey, you will know that it is the exact same book, except this dog's bad air comes out the opposite end. Like I said, it is funny, but Kotzwinkle could have come up with the idea on his own, instead of ""borrowing"" it from another hilarious book and inventive author."
1,Is it my imagination...,"...or is this book a complete rip-off of Dogbreath by Dav Pilkey? Same basic plotline: dog about to be forcibly ejected from a family because of his odor problem, only to save the day by using said problem to knock out burglars. Hmm... All in all, I would recommend Dav Pilkey's book over this one. The illustrations are much cuter (Walter looks kinda creepy to me), and halitosis is less embarrassing than flatulence for adults to talk about with kids. Just my two cents' worth. :)"
5,Extremely funny,"I.... You have to LIGHTEN UP A LITTLE. We all need a good laugh every now and then. If you can't laugh at this book then you are lacking a sense of humor. I received this book from an adult friend (co-worker)of mine for my birthday. We all just died laughing reading it. You are talking kindergarten teachers here. Poor Walter, his facial expressions are just precious. The illustrations are wonderful. Thanks for giving us something to laugh about!!"
5,FUNNY,"As an adult with a dog with a similar problem, I loved this book. I laughed from the first page to the last. Everyone with a sense of humor will love this book. Kids will get a big kick out of it."
1,"Wow, So Crudeness and Bodily Emissions Are Now Suitable...","... reading material, for pre-schoolers who may already be bombarded with same from television. What a treat--not. The author succeeds in getting cheap laughs by repeating the ""F"" word over and over, and by showing the mutt with clouds issuing from beneath his tail. Clever. Tacky. What was the motivation, I wonder? <shaking head>"
2,inappropriateness agreed,"I have seen this book everywhere! As I am looking for a book to help teach my (3 year old) manners. I have not purchased it, nor will I. I cannot see how using toilet humor encourages any manners in the preschool set or otherwise. Preschoolers are notorious mimics! Someone mention tolerance, but even that should not be relegated to farting! I could only see how this books shock humor would only be appreciate by adults, or older children with an understanding (the difference between what is acceptable and what is not). Hopefully ... I will soon discover a book more appropriate."
1,Spare me,"Well, there are GOOD books and then there are BAD books. This one deserves the trash can. Pathetic and in very bad taste. Who cut the cheese, man ???"
2,Grandma Arlene,"Didn't care for the book. My daughters thought the 4-year-old grandkids get enough ""potty humor"" and ""potty talk"" at pre-school without drawing more attention to it when they are trying to ignore the use of such words."
1,No place for this humor at school.,I can't imagine why any teacher (or parent) would buy this title for their children. I don't think that the subject is appropriate. The illustrations and text are crude.
1,Appropriate or Inappropriate?,"This book can be very funny at times, but I believe that the illustrations can be very scary for young ones to look at.Yes, there are better books out there, but this book gives some kids a good laugh, but while reading this book to our kids, we should teach them that farting is inappropriate in public."
1,Walter the Farting Dog is too much like Flatulent Fred,"After reading Walter the farting dog I have come to realize that it shared the same storyline as Flatulent Fred, a book written by Kathy Wuertz and copyrighted in 1998. I find it hard to enjoy a book that was stolen from someone else and then sold to make millions!!! I would have given it 0 stars, but one was the least I could give.Waylon Wuertz"
2,Thought this book would be really funny....,"I can't think of much positive to say about this book. I HATE the illustrations in it. I think they are downright creepy looking. It's too wordy, whereas I thought it'd be short phrases and a cute story. Nope."
1,Worst Book Ever!,"This is one of the worst children's books I've ever read, and as a teacher, I've read a lot of children's books. The story isn't even funny. Dad sells the dog at the garage sale and then lies to his kids. Then the dog gets hooked up to a machine that uses his farts to blow up balloons? Ridiculous! I bought this for my son thinking it would be funny, because he's at that age where he likes to talk about farts, but I'm getting rid of it!"
1,shocked in Virgina,"I can understand adults getting a laugh out of this. To choose to encourage children to laugh at flatulence is unbelievable. My kids laugh enough at it that I feel no need to spend money to make it even funnier to them. It is the adults job to teach them manners. How will they ever handle it approporiately in public situations if we encourage it to be an hysterical matter? This book is fine for older kids who already know how to be polite about it. It is ok for adults who want a fun laugh. It is awful for children who can only be confused by the conflicting messages they get. Spend your money on a more productive book, please!!!!"
1,A book with a very negative message,"Due to a gas problem, the father in the story decides that Walter has to go back to the pound. It turns out Walter is saved by blind luck. Burglars enter the house and Walter protects the family's possessions. In the end, the father decides he can stick around. It's really not a good idea to teach kids that an animal (or a person) needs to prove himself useful in order to be worthy of love. I encountered stories like this as a child and found them upsetting. I can't believe stuff like this can even be published."
5,Loved it!,Such an absolutely cute/hysterical book. Gave it to my mom for her birthday (she had always wanted it) and we couldn't stop laughing. We both loved it! Definitely a book that will bring a smile to your face no matter what age you are.
4,OMG they're not terrified?,"Many people seem to be concerned that reading this book will encourage potty humor and make kids afraid of intruders. I have to say, this book is a favorite at our house and I have yet to see an increase in the fart jokes or have any of my kids fearful of burglars. Hmmmm..... I wonder if the same people have reviewed books such as, lets see, Hansel and Gretel and worried that their children may suddenly become frightened of candy and ovens.All snarkiness aside, this is a hilarious children's book. I found the illustrations to be quite nice--different from the traditional watercolor or pencil drawings. I love when an illustrator uses a new style. This book will stay in our family's favorite reading pile."
4,economic history of the post WWII world.,"How many individuals can look back on their careers and survey the influence that they have had on their industry with the intelligence and objectivity of Dr. Kaufman as evidenced in this well written memoir. To be sure, his explanations of the monetary and fiscal environments and the economic consequences over the past 40 years are at times dry. The sections dealing with his experiences and the evolution of the financial services industry are absolutely fascinating. Recommended to anyone interested in macroeconomics and particularly to economic students.This should become required reading in Macro 101 courses."
2,UGH - What a Disappointment,"I looked forward to diving into this book. It starts off promising, with descriptions of Dr. Kaufman's humble beginnings and his career path. But suddenly, at about Chapter Four it turns into a plodding and redundant dissertation on economics and financial markets. I expected a little more insight and less hair-splitting (e.g. at one point he takes the time to explain the difference between liquidity and marketability.) Maybe I'm not the brightest guy in the world and the material is beyond my meager comprehension. I found this book extremely disappointing and huge waste of my time."
5,6 outlet surge protector,"Great product at a great price, shipped fast and the product works awesome! I bought three and all three are connected and working good. no complains here."
4,Good Cheap Power Strip,"For this price I can't complain. It has minimal protection, but I don't have any expensive electronics hooked up to it. If you have expensive electronics, don't get this one."
4,"This thing seems cheaply builty, but hey! it was less than $10",And I guess I should not expect much more from a power strip other than what this thing provides which is multiple outlets from one and surge protection.
4,Good standard Surge product.,"Pros:-Led indicator if something is wrong-Price-Bottom plug area for larger plugs-Surge protection is up to code (surge protector rated 600 joules or more)Cons:-if you have large adapters this may not be for youNote:-if you want a surge protector with telephone, Ethernet and cable inputs you will not find them-it is not hospital grade-double check ur length you need bc u may want a 8 feet for more room sometimes"
1,Maybe it is just me...,"Maybe it is just me, or I am missing some basic knowledge concerning power outlets and this surge protector...but I could not get my three-pronged PS3 or my television cord to fit into this surge protector. Any two-pronged plug seems to fit and operate properly, but I am very disappointed since I bought this to protect my more expensive purchases (my playstation, my television, and I cannot plug in my computer charger either) so be warned consumers, this may be a concern when purchasing this item."
1,Low quality,The plastic buckle undoes itself. Find something else because this product does not work.
4,"Slick, but perhaps too slick","The money belt is a good size. It has two compartments one of which is big enough to hold letters, and the other one is passport size. This is convenient because those are precisely the things you might want to protect when you are traveling.Unfortunately, the belt clip is too thin, and it opens quite easily. If you are using it under jeans or some other hard fabric it will get pressed accidentally which is annoying."
1,Horrible Product IMO,"This product does not live up to the Samsonite name. First of all, it did not stay buckled, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of wearing a money belt. I mean the ""money"" belt won't do a traveler much good if it comes unbuckled and slips from underneath his shirt and onto the ground without the traveler even knowing it has done so. I was lucky when mine came unbuckled because I had my shirt tucked in.The material is also too thick and heavy, making it too hot and very uncomfortable. And finally, after two or three uses the cheap, plastic buckle broke. If you're a serious traveler, this product is not for you. Buyer beware."
1,Collectibles to Commemorate the Year 2000.,"I have a 12 year old daughter who enjoys collecting dolls with me. Each doll we collect has a special meaning for her. This doll is very pretty and will help her remember the year she turned twelve and the significance the American families place on the past and on the future in celebrating the millenium. The doll supposedly is in limited production so its a good idea to purchase it early before it is gone from the stores. The cost remains reasonable for a collectible.I also will purchase the matching Hallmark ornament. I have been collecting these ornaments since they were released. Sometimes the ornaments are more stunning than the dolls they are based on. This may be the case this year.Mattel should have issued a more spectacular doll for the year 2000, like those of the Holiday Barbie series. I think the designers missed a great marketing opportunity. While the doll is pretty,-the quality is mediocre in comparison to previous releases."
3,Great Collectibles,"I have Bought the Holiday Barbie Doll for my sister for the past ten years, and she looks forward to them each year. It seems that they get harder to find each year, So to avoid disappointed kids get them early. The value of the Doll does compare to the joy and memories they'll have."
3,Celebration 2000 Barbie,"My daughter enjoys collecting Barbies of all types. They are all still in their original boxes with the price tags on them. She really looks forward to the special editions, like the Celebration 2000. However her disappointment this year-was not being able to find a African American Celebration 2000 Barbie, to complete her set. She loves making sets of the special ones. I think the Celebration 2000 Barbie is pretty-but I have to say, I was amazed to find ones that showed a very slight difference-from the same company. You have to look very close to see these differences-we found some that had just a hint of different eye color or a tiny difference in the box color. But all-in-all we agree that the dolls are pretty. I hope that the quality of these dolls stays the same and the company knows how much these dolls are cherished."
5,Celebration Barbie,Until today I never was positive wheather or not I owned a real collectable barbie. But when I started looking around I found this Celebration Barbie. I am so excited for I have always thought it looked like a vauluable doll. But now it is for real. I love this doll becuae it is so pretty and fun to pley with. I would suggest this doll to any one who likes beautiful dolls. For I have a pretty good feeling this doll in a couple of years is going to be worth lots of money. This doll is so much fun to own.applejuice
2,very disappointed,"I purchased my multimeter in January of 2009 and was satisfied with the ease of use and the functionality. The booklet included with the meter was very helpful. I have a classic car and purchased the meter to find shorts and set the dwell. Recently as I began to use the tool, the dwell read 45 when turned on and not connected. When connected it was obviously way off - as the car would not have run if the reading had been correct. I tested the rpm reading which also was incorrect. I tried several times to switch it off and on, but that didn't have any effect nor did removing and reinstalling the battery. I emailed customer service describing my problem. Their response was to ask about the purchase date. Once they had that information,they informed me that my meter was out of warranty and there was no way to repair it.I realize that there are much more expensive multimeters, but I used this meter 4-5 times in two years. That seems like a quality issue."
3,Working outdoors in warm weather? Don't buy!,"I'm calling attention to a critical design flaw: If this unit is used outdoors and isn't left in the shade, the screen will go pitch black. You can put it in the freezer to make the screen viewable again within a minute or two depending on exposure, but don't expect to feel productive doing it.If you're gonna work outdoors, be prepared to be doing a lot of bending over sticking it underneath vehicles.I am very unhappy with this piece of crap.I'll go to a yard sale next time I need an accurate volt/ohm meter.Way worse than my wavetek 28xt, purchased for the same price.If my father weren't an electrical engineer who needed a capacitor checker, I would have never had to buy this piece of China.-=- End The FED -=-"
1,Buy a Fluke or anything besides this piece of crap,I bought this 6 weeks ago and used the continuity tester to check some wiring in my resuscitation of a dead car. It works great. Now that the mechanical parts are done I went to use the Ohmeter. It doesn't work. Neither does the DC Voltmeter. The Continuity tester still works great! I only used one function on this piece of crap once. Buy any other brand.
3,a little more or a little less,"I got this thing based on it's reviews but I feel I should have spent more money for an OTC or entry level fluke. It feels flimsy and cheap and didn't come with a battery. Based on features alone this thing scores well but if you just need a simple super accurate multimeter then spend less and get a multimeter right here on amazon for about 24 dollars. If you, like me, depend on your tools to make a living in often harsh conditions then spend the cash for a true rms OTC or fluke. If you are just tinkering with your car then this actron will do the job."
5,ACTRON CP7677 Automotive TroubleShooter - digital multimeter,"I have used it several times and have checked the readings with a friend's Fluke meter and they agree. For the price, I am very happy."
2,Tone doesn't work out of the box,"Just bought one of these off the shelf and ran the usual basic tests (continuity, voltage) and found that the continuity test didn't make an audible tone as it should when touching the test leads. By chance I found that if you shake the meter a little bit then the tone works. Obviously a defective unit. Perhaps this could be just back luck, but I'm still suspicious. Other than that it looks pretty nice."
2,It would have got a lot more stars however,Two functions (rpm and dwell ) do not work. I could return it but that will cost me. So I shall keep it around the shop and use as a DMM.
3,Not very satified,I bought the meter particulary for the dwell and rpm function. I tested both of these and found the rpm function did not work as it should have. I was measuring rpm on a 4 cylinder engine with the selector on 4 cylinders and the rpm reading was like 250 x 10 at idle. and was actually running like 600 rpms. So I'm pretty sure I wasn't doing anything wrong in the test. I can't give the rating 5 stars.
5,Meter,Had a technician that had this meter and it got water in it. Amazon is the first place I looked. Reasonable price and seller shipped fast. Easy work...Good Job
5,this book brings back warm memories,i too loved this book as a child. i feel kind of inadequate as a reviewer. i just have to write honestly and say i'm just thrilled that i can purchase this wonderful book about the mischeivous cats and dolls. now i as a grown up own both cats and dolls and this book makes me wonder about their behaviour while i'm away from the house. don't miss this gem!
3,good.. but hmmmm..,This is a good cd.. and I would rate this 3 and a half if I could... it just never really caught on to me... I was recommended this cd because I like the Invocation of Nehek.. but this band is no way near as good as they are... my oppinion... the singer's voice just turns me off..from this band.... not recommended by me...
4,Melon Demon Divine,"Europe sound with steroids, and with influence from the '90, like Motley Crue, Skid Row. Good work...Kee Marcello still rocks!"
5,Blue Oyster Cult,The best band in history! I love this group and aim at owning every song they have performed. BOC RULES!
3,Three and a half stars!,"Ok...it's not legendary...don't get carried away. This is a good cd with some great songs. ""Shooting Shark"" is awesome. ""Light Years of Love"" is a ballad only BOC could get away with. ""Take Me Away"" is great as well as ""Dragon Lady"". But for me I bought the disc for ""Veins"". What a awesome song. Just get past the 80's keyboard sound and your in for a real treat. Turn this one way up...lol This song is soooo intense. I love it!"
3,Quality Songwriting Buried By Horrible Production Values,"What dates this album and makes it seem like one of BOC's weakest efforts is the production. Period.If you listen closely, you can hear that there are some really interesting song ideas contained on this album. ""Take Me Away"" is a great rock song. But before you can get to the songwriting, you've got to get past the abyssmal hair-band 80s production values, and that's no small feat. The drum sound alone is horrendous, and everything is awash in a thick morass of mind-numbing reverb and compression. There are moments on this record when one cannot tell that one is listening to BOC....this could be ANY 80s metal band.For a MUCH better representation of BOC from this general period, go with Fire of Unknown Origin."
3,You have to listen to it about 5 times.,"Wow, i picked this one up in some forgotten place. I just thought it was a lost, forgotten album, and it fascinated me. I listened to it once and forgot about it for a long time. But lately i've been listening to it more and more, and i really do love some of the songs. ""Shadow of California"" really is great, and so is ""Eyes on Fire"". I guess you just have to be in lost, lonely, and forgotten mood to enjoy it."
4,MORE MUZAK COURTESY BOC,"Consider the diss reviews. Why so lenghty? This rare gem can be popped into your stereo and played as background household music, ...and hardly be noticed. Thats how cool it is. Its just there. Absolutley nothing special. Just endlessly listenable."
2,The Revolution On Hold,"I can't understand the raves this one's getting from y'all. Outside of ""Take Me Away"" and ""Shooting Shark"", this album is truly lackluster. Most of the songs could have been done by anyone, and that's a sad fate for a band that normally stands out from the pack. ""Eyes On Fire"", for example, might in fact actually be an anonymous guest appearance by Survivor (or insert some other one-named forgotten early 80's MTV band here). The playing throughout is uninspired - guess they were ""Goin' Through The Motions"" this time out, right, kids? And, as a drummer, Rick Downey (who replaced A. Bouchard) makes a great road manager. I'll pass on this one, thanks."
2,BOC's worst album,"This is NOT the place to start if you're curious about Blue Oyster Cult. Only a couple of the songs are really good, and of those, only one, ""Shadow of California"", is at all typical of BOC. ""Shooting Shark"" is a fine song, sung well by Buck Dharma, but it deserved better arranging and production than this; the synthesizer backing is bland, and the sax solos dull and pointless. ""Take Me Away"" is almost a parody of better BOC songs about UFOs such as ""E.T.I. (Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)"". The rest of the album is best forgotten.If you're a true BOC fan, then of course you want everything they've put out, so you have to have this. Less-committed listeners, however, should avoid it. BOC newcomers should start with one of the band's real classics, such as ""Tyranny and Mutation"", ""Agents of Fortune"", or ""Fire of Unknown Origin""."
2,Hmmm well what can I say,"I'm an old BOC fan and I am sorry to say this album is not that good.Sorry guys, you can do alot better."
2,When Things Went Really Bad,"Although BOC had systematically watered itself down over the years since the last briliant effort, Secret Treaties, Revolution is a turning point into the worst era. To start with, the first breakdown of the original line-up occurs as brother Albert is replaced by the horrible Rick Downey (drum roadie and future manager of Anthrax)who made his debut, overplaying on the ETI live record. This is another attempt at blatant 80's pop, as the band teams with (yuck!!!!) Aldo Nova to write a hit single in his (blah!!!)style. Why should a classic rock band embrace and 80's one hit wonderboy ? [....] The rest of the album sounds like a weak remake of Spectres their most boring record. They never made a worthwhile record again; this would have been a good time to quit with a little dignity intact."
4,good boc disc,"This disc had some real standout tracks on it. But after the ultra classic 'fire of unknown origin"" it was a slight letdown to many of us. the band should have kept to that type of attack but they started expirimenting with this one. And they came out with some great songs like 'shooting shark"" and 'take me away' those songs are among the bands best ever too. But the rest of the cd isn't as powerful. That being said the rest of the cd was still filled with decent songs but you could sense a lack of direction that was falling away from what had gone before. They needed a that sharper bite and focus that would have kept them at the top. I would say though that any fan of melodic metal (the greatest kind ever ) would enjoy this cd and any rock fan might as well."
1,Anguilla dvd ?? Don't bother,"We are planning a trip to Anguilla next Easter so really fancied getting this dvd to see some of what the island has to offer. It begins with a realaxing scene of water lapping a beach, beautiful of course.....and then contiues to show nothing else for the entire twenty minutes !!!!! I didn't want to watch a relaxation dvd just one about Anguilla! There are also a few slides to look at but by this time we had lost interest completely. Don't waste your money."
1,"Oh, dear","I find it odd that several reviewers laud Mr. Kilian's inclusion of basic writing tips. Give me a break! This slim book should concentrate on web writing, not be a primer for those who can't agree their verbs and subjects. The information provided is woefully general and outdated. Mr. Kilian is an older gentleman whose main career as he describes it was back in the 1960s; his text definitely reads like a time capsule. Savvy professionals serious about learning the particular skill of web writing will get almost nothing from this book. A solid copywriting manual (Sugarman) would be better. I'm still on the hunt for valuable web-writing instruction. Recommendations welcome!"
1,Silence is better than pain,"These things are a novelty item and should be sold alongside whoopie cushions. They actually hurt when on, and getting a good sound out of them is nearly impossible. The premise is terrific, but the reality is something altogether different. Unfortunately so, because having music in the pool would make the transition to swimming that much better.Oh well. Enjoying silence is not a bad thing either. Save the money for something else."
2,Muffled sound,"I'm very disappointed in the sound quality of these headphones. They are waterproof, but sound muffled."
2,Like listening to someone sing into a paper cup -through a straw,I gave this two stars and not one because these headphones are unique in that you can submerge them in water and hear sound without ruining the headphones. Unfortunately the sound quality is very poor.
1,May work for some but not for most,"The biggest problems with these headphones are that THEY DON'T STAY IN! now your reading this going ""i can just tape them or use my goggle straps to hold them on"", well you cant. If water gets in then the sound stops and your done, you can get them set up well enough on land so water stays out but when you start swiming things like turning your head to breath or doing a turn will shift them and water will get in and your done. Also, there is NO BASS at ALL. For some reason the headphones don't have them. Good idea but in practice they fail. these aren't even good enough for just sitting in a hot tub."
3,"Work fairly well, but will take some getting used to ...","I found the sound to be fine, although certainly not as good as my Sennheisers, but it takes a bit of a learning curve to find the right spot in the ears to maximize the sound.They certainly are not as comfortable as my other earbuds with the rigid frame that goes around the back of the head. I think that will take some getting used to for me.They work well with my Otterbox and, for me anyway, the cord seems to be the appropriate length.All in all, I think that these could be better designed but are definitely better than nothing at this point if I were going to be at/near the ocean. If they get ruined I will be a lot less heartbroken (if at all, only because of the money spent) than if my Sennheisers got damaged!"
1,buy only if you have VERY LOW expectations,"I was excited about this product, but it has been a complete flop. the first set fizzed when minor strain on the headphones broke the contacts with the case. The customer service rep was very good about getting a replacement, however. The second pair, despite tinkering, cutting, adding ear plugs to headphones, never could give me a reliable sound for more than a lap. I appreciate their effort on this VIP problem, but don't settle for this attempt."
2,nice idea,"I was so excited about being able to swim with music. I have been waiting for this type of product for a long time. .. I have been swimming with these earphones with my waterproof shuffle daily for a week. When any water enters my ears, it is so muffled that it is impossible to listen and swim at the same time. I have spent well over half hour per day to improve this problem. silicone gel, swimcap pulled over my ears... nothing stops the water from entering. I talked to customer support who was nice, but admitted that it was a common problem fro real swimmers. "" These were not designed for lap swimmers, it was made for being in the pool"" He seemed like the reurn was no problem as long as it was within 30 days. I like the cord length. Anything longer would interfere with swimming. I wear my shuffle on my arm, though. If you want it any other place(like on waist) I could see how that wold be problematic."
3,It works but cord is short,These headphones do work but the cord is short and pulls if you wear them around your neck. I put the cord beneath my chin.
3,"short cord, not what i was expecting","after reading a couple reviews on here i was pretty excited to be getting these. i dont swim with them, but cant imagine they would be good for that. i wanted some earphones that wouldnt get damaged in the rain, and i could excercise and get all sweaty with. these seem bulky, the cord isnt long enough by a MILE and im pretty disappointed. aw."
1,flimsy and easily broken,"After using this product for five days in the pool (five hours of use) it no longer works. It appears that the jack is very flimsy, and that ANY stress on the cord attaching the headphones to the jack (such as wearing the headphones!) will immediately dislodge the wire from the jack and rending the headphones useless.It's a shame- I was SO excited to find a set of headphones that stayed put while I swam laps, and was comfortable. But the fact they died so quickly (I normally get at least a month out of the cheapy ones) just irritates me. I'd wait a while for the company to perfect these, because clearly the first ones produced have some major issues.I don't understand why someone can't invent a sturdy, comfortable pair of waterproof headphones. They don't have to be high fidelity or anything, just as long as they don't short out all the time."
1,Go with the Aquapac instead!,"I was excited to listen to music while swimming, so I bought and Otter box, and H2O Swimbelt and the H2O headphones. The system worked except for the horrible headphones, they could not keep water out, I tried it every way I could. Got some audio in one ear for two swim laps,...very frustrating (and expensive). Very reluctantly I tried another set of headphones (just this week): the Aquapac Waterproof Headphones. they worked 100%. I cannot say how long these will hold up, but I know they work now. The H2O Audio phones never worked (and were very uncomfortable)."
1,Doesn't fit,The headphones are just too small to fit on my head (which is large but not unusually so) and there's absolutely no way to adjust them so they can fit.
2,"Terrible sound, uncomfortable, break easily",I was excited about having waterproof headphones but these are very cheaply made and already there's a bad connection in the cable. They're also hard to get lined up properly in your ear canal and don't block out the water. This means the sound has different intensities as water goes in and out of your ears.I would steer clear of these phones.
1,These headphones are useless and waterproof,These headphones are inaudible under water.They are also uncomfortable to wear.You can not hear the music under water.Not recommending these.
3,Please give me a new pair of headphones!!!,"I really liked these headphones, they didnt sound too bad for something your listening to underwater. The first pair I had got a loose wire and started cutting in and out, till finally there was no sound at all. I thought that it was because I was too rough with them. So I got my second pair,I've only used them about 2 1/2 weeks( being very careful with them) and again the same thing is happening. For 25.00 to 30.00 I expect better quality. I'm going to try and get a replacement but You all know how that goes. Wish me luck."
1,This is CM Gold Series - NOT Harbor Bay,"I have been buying Harbor Bay Stretch Waist Pants for years. They fit me like a glove. Unfortunately, they don't sell them anymore. If you order them they send you the new CM Gold Series replacement which is absolute CRAP! I have to buy pants 3 sizes larger than the Harbor Bay and they STILL don't fit right! Even Amazon sends you the replacement even if you leave a comment about ONLY wanting Harbor Bay and ""PLEASE PLEASE don't send me CM Gold Series!""CM Gold Series is a completely different cut made with completely different material. There is no way this is even close to an acceptable replacement for Harbor Bay."
1,Former Employees,"Typical ""former employee"" fare which leaves huge holes in the dragging story for obvious reasons and falls deeply into the ""it's all about me"" trap. Reynolds' own bio was more entertaining and more forthright."
5,Finally Back in Print,"Not for your average Joe, but Simpkin's thesis should not be lost on anyone: swiftness. Since first published, the world has witnessed numerous conflicts which either could have been avoided, concluded earlier, or fought more decisively if effective forces could have been deployed much faster. It is incredibly pertinent in the emerging era of the asymetrical approach, where threats emerging faster and in a wide variety of terrain. (We can't expect future adversaries to give us months to build up massive mechanized forces in ideal terrain like Hussien did!) Simpkin points out very practical limitations to our current heavy forces -- like getting a 70 tonne tank over a third-world bridge or down a narrow twisting road. As the US Army begins retooling for the 21st century, Simpkin's work is incredibly relevant. Not the easiest book to follow, but worth the effort."
3,Good Service from Amazon,"I ordered a cell phone with a cingular plan from Amazon. Amazon was great. Cingular has been less than acceptable. The first phone I recieved was ""a lemon."" This is what the Cingular people told me. Amazon replaced it with no cost to me. Cingular's service has been terrible. But, to their honor, their customer service has been very friendly and helpful in resovling the issues. I also think they are overpriced for the service they offer in Southern California."
2,Not nearly worth the price,"Works great, but the pricing is absurd. Especially since Cingular will not allow the SMARTPHONE connect plan to be used with SMARTPHONES! Instead, they require you to purchase the exact same plan for twice the price. Greed is a horrible thing. Be advised, the $40 price tag doesn't even include ANY text messages, and according to the EULA, this Unlimited plan comes with limited bandwidth and approved usage. False advertisement and extortive pricing that would seem extreme even to the mafia makes the PDA Connect Unlimited plan hard to recommend."
5,Toro makes dependable products,Toro makes dependable products. I have them in my irrigation system for over 14 years and 90% of them are still functioning since day one.
2,Wow....,The first one sounded cool and I rented this one by mistake. Well it wasnt much of a story......and was kinda bland....so if you want an ok movie and you're bored out of your mind
4,"Not COMPLETELY complete, but pretty darn close.","If you ever needed to look up an anime OVA or movie title, be it the original Japnese title of it's English translation, you could probably find it here. I've only noticed one omission, but found a lot of other titles I've never heard of."
1,Will only fit Cuisinart pans,From the description I figured this double boiler would fit my variety of pans. It does not. Too wide and too deep. I recieved free shipping to my house but had to pay to ship it back. Was not happy with any of it.
2,Double boiler is only half,"What??? A double boiler without the bottom part that holds the water isn't functional. It should be made CLEAR that it comes as only the top part with a curved bottom that won't stand on it's own. Thusly, unless the other part, which is another saucepan w/ lid is purchased, you're out of luck. Btw, the other half costs as much as the double boiler."
2,Hard to store double boiler,"The double boiler I ordered is of good quality. However, it is very hard to store in my small area I have. It won't sit level so I have to fit it in another pan. This causes another problem since the double boiler comes with a lid and the pot I sit it in has a lid so I end up with 2 lids. As I said, my area is very limited. Most of the time I wouldn't have a problem having an extra lid but I have nowhere to store the extra lid. I would recommend this double boiler if an extra lid is no problem. Thanks, Nancy Aldridge"
5,Awesome set of cookware!!!,"My husband purchased several pieces of this cookware . We had searched all over and these really do the job. They are HEAVY...the handles aren't hollow and therefore don't get water in them. They clean up great. I bought Bartender's Friend (cleaner), which is recommended for this cookware and they shine up beautifully. You will not regret buying these if you are thinking about it.This set will last us the rest of our lives.They would make a great gift as well."
1,Destructive copy protection,"If you must buy this CD, don't put it in your computer. The destructive copy protection will crash PCs and Macs. If you have a newer Mac without a manual eject on the CD drive (such as an iMac) it will take a costly trip to an authorized repair store... This is a seriously defective product, and is unsafe at any speed. Click on the cover picture to see the little warning in the lower right corner, but there is another sticker covering this on the jewel box. Your only other warning is that it doesn't have the ""CD"" logo since it doesn't meet standards."
3,There are better ones out there....,"I like this CD because it means that I don't have to put 3 Roger Waters CD's in the player. It is a pretty sample of his solo works. Although I'm upset that there isn't more from the Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking. (Namely the title song). The flow on this one isn't as good as the Pink Floyd Best of CDs. The songs are some of his better works. The two unreleased songs are good, but I've heard better versions that I downloaded. I wish ""Each Small Candle"" was a studio version rather than the live version I already have.I'm even more upset that this is yet another greatest hits collection from Floyd (and Waters). I wish Roger Waters would finish the rumored album he is working on."
3,Australia-only release--Disregard Krishnaswamy's Rant,"This is a response to Raghuram Krishnaswamy's review, who probably didn't realize that this was a very limited, regional release.Flickering Flame was only released in Australia,and it was released to promote Waters' (at the time) upcoming concerts there. Waters toured extensively from 1999-2001, and this release was given out to radio stations, the fan club and anyone else interested, to get people excited about Waters playing in Sydney etc. So, if Waters was really interested in the money, he could've released this worldwide. It was really just a promitional tool in a very specific region (Australia).That said, I think Roger's comments on the Echoes compilation stand up.This is for die-hard fans really, those who don't already own Towers of Faith. Plus, the title track, though a demo, is definitly worth picking up if you're a fan--the lyrics are really great."
2,"""A Rog Re-Hash""","This CD is a feeble attempt by Roger Waters to help keep his name alive. He must be the 100th person to do ""Knocking on Heaven's Door."" It is sad, a great mind like Roger Waters put forth an offering of this caliber to his devoted fans. I am sorely dissapointed. And, the new songs are a joke! His best hope is to get back with the Floyd if he wishes to save his legacy (which is ""A Flickering Flame""). Not very fond of his political views either......I'm bored with them!"
3,Just started reading it.,I read the book about Peter Shilton and really enjoyed it. Bought this book and I'm approximately 1/3 through it and I'm finding it as enjoyable as the Shilton book. It's interesting to read to different approaches to the goalkeeper position...especially the international aspect.
1,Crap,"Poorly written, no real insight into the person. Its just page after page of vague match summaries and meaningless things. And some of the language is badly written as this was translated from a danish version of the book. Not worth a read."
5,good,"nothing to say, one real thing is that its really good. If you are peter's fans, you must buy it. Best book I have ever seen"
1,TERRIBLE SERVICE,"I order my lights, and the came before delivery time, I was very please until I open the box. the package look like it had been on a storm. very very damage. Personally I don't recomend the seller (They fail to solve my problem, they don't even return my mails anymore).The lights shopping experience was terrible, the lights itself are ok!"
2,Dust off your Ph.d and Try to Decipher the Options Market,"An executive I respect felt that this book by one of his old professors would give great insight to Foreign Currency Option Stategies. As more of a fundamental analyst than a technician I was mostly lost. I struggled through a master's and most of a doctorate, but statistics was always a pain. Beware that advanced mathematical underpinnings are crucial to the enjoyment of the book. For the amateur who wants to understand why rocket scientists (for real) are hired from Cal Poly and MIT to run Wall Street trading programs, we;;, just keep this book near your computer when you think your day trading will beat the pros."
2,Cute but not practical,"The clothes were adorable but definately not a practical one. The chore falls on the parent when the child cannot get the clothes on the doll. Once on they fit, but getting them there is a battle."
1,Unhealthy/poor choice toy for a child,"This is clearly an unhealthy product to give a child of such a young age.Reasons: Clothing is completly age/society inapropraite, fake leather is used (it is supossed to be real) with says it is fine to kill animals, no sleves on shirt, only a tube style, tight clothes, and it is supossed to be worn by an infant 'Bratz' doll.This is a poor choice for a child."
1,Drivel.,"Very characteristic of a certain US right wing worldview (what's referred to on the AltHist forums as a ""RWD"" or Republican Wet Dream). The lone Republical/Conservative/Texan must save the world from the liberal folly.......The author clearly lacks any knowledge of (and has failed to carry out basic research on) military tactics/strategy/logistics, basic physics, naval architecture... well pretty much every other topic. Being written in the eighties is no excuse; even then the concepts he uses were known to be rubbish.As for his worldview it's equally bad; decadent Europe (and Africa/Asia/ME) has been conquered by the nasty Russians and it's up to the Texans to save the day. He also shows a utter lack of understanding of economic, sociology, physics et cetera.It's a pity trees died for this nonsense."
5,remarkable and timely,"If you have ever read a book on the art of negotiation this book is a must read case study.General Dayan writes an even handed report on the process which established the admittedly ""cold"" peace between Egypt and Israel in 1979. The pressures from the Carter White House as well as from the various Arab Nations and the Palestinian Arabs as well factor into a highly complex interaction and Dayan reveals the strategies employed by all sides as clearly as he can perceive them. Personally I think there is a lot of valuable insight here not only for the student of negotiation but for anyone who is currently a player in the area of international relations. Very worth the time it takes to read and digest the material. I find it has illumined the current world political scene for me in profound ways."
2,not the same quality as other Multiclad Pro cookware,"The build quality for the steamer is much lighter than the Multiclad Pro line of pans -- it does not feel like it's made from the same 3-ply construction. Also the steamer compartment is quite shallow, which limits its usefulness. It is too shallow to fit a jumbo artichoke, which would be a perfect candidate for steaming."
5,JIMMYG,"GOT THIS ITEM NO CHANCE TO USE IT, BUT IF LIKE THE SET I PREVIOUSLY PURCHACED ,I AM SURE IT WILL BE GREAT"
5,"If you steam food, this is great",I bought this with the Cuisinart 3-quart sauce pan. It sits on top so you can actually steam instead of boiling the food like some of the inserts do.My only complaint is that the lid doesn't have a vent.
2,Bad fit,I must have gotten a defective product. The left earpiece stuck out from my ear on the bottom. No amount of adjusting could fix the problem. Switching left to right didn't help either. I didn't even bother to plug it into my player so I can't vouch for the sound quality. Sent these back for a refund.
3,Inland 87050 Dynamic Stereo Headphones with Volume Control (Black),"I was expecting loud headphones to supplement my pretty low CD player volume, and the connotation to the volume control part I hoped would increase the loudness of the portable device, but that failed to do so. However, instead of returning it, I decided to utilize it at the gym on a treadmill because sometimes, when you jump to a certain speed, the volume shockingly shoots up very loud; it's not good when that happens while you're wearing ear plugs."
5,Love these headphones!,"Received these headphones last week, and I am very pleased! I actually got them for my daughters to be able to listen comfortably, but I am keeping them for myself...and buying my husband a pair, too! They are very well made, have a nice long cord, are cushy/comfortable, and the volume control is awesome. Turning the volume switch all the way up does not at all decrease the quality of the sound, like I would have expected. The sounds stays just as rich and vibrant, and I don't have to worry about the volume control on my player or computer! A little tight around your head...but I've found that all headphones this style fit nice and snug...so I didn't expect anything else. Would definitely recommend...and how can you beat this price?!"
4,Decent for the price,"I've definitely had better headphones. The in-line volume control is nice, and so is the fact that it only has one cord is cool. Sound quality okay. For those that complain of the ear cups not fitting too well, make sure the cord is on your left side, when you put them on (as I did not see any ""L"" or ""R"" markings on the ear cups' sides, like most headphones), because it did make a difference in comfort, compared to when I had them the other way around."
3,Decent set of headphones for the price.,"I bought these to replace a set of headphones I rolled over with my desk chair. I wear these headphones for a few hours at a time, and after a while they get pretty uncomfortable. The sound quality is good (not stellar, but what do you expect for this price) but as far as comfort, these fail."
4,Good enough for my purpose,"These are not top quality headphones, just good enough for my purpose which was watching TV at night without bothering my neighbors using the volume control. For that purpose the volume control of these headphones worked just fine."
4,Excellent,These are excellent headphones for the money. The volume control is the feature that made me choose these phones. I use them to increase the volume on the TV while the wife watches at a lower volume.
5,Oft Overlooked Christmas Gem,"A real crime that this isn't available on DVD, as this is my all time favorite christmas movie. Quietly funny, sad and sweet, and the perfect antidote for a lonely christmas. Nice soundtrack by Mark Knoffler, full of quirky oddball performances, and a hilarious ""Mr. Bunny"" jingle that will stick in your mind whether you want it to or not (""hello folks!"")."
5,Christmas Isn't Christmas Without Ice Cream,"Yes, an Ice Cream Mafia War. This is the high art that Bill Forsyth was so well-known for in the 1980s. Fabulous performances by all, as a DJ gets drawn into an ice cream war, helping him to get over heartache at the holidays. I don't believe CP Grogan as an Italian girl (nightmare accent when speaking Italian!), but she's gorgeous and they're all funny and it's worth it just to hear the partriarch say, ""Mr. Bunny."""
5,Unsurpassable,"I can only echo what several others have said: this is my favorite Xmas movie of all time. Then again, Local Hero is one of my desert island flicks, so maybe my fondness for the gentle, quirky humor of this film is no accident. I MUST HAVE THIS ON DVD!! Can anyone help? (Region 1)Bill Forsythe must make more movies, and soon!!!"
3,enjoyable--but not up to Forsyth's best work,"Come on, guys. From any other director, ""Comfort and Joy"" would seem pretty darn fine--however, IMHO, it falls short of Forsyth's best work. The character development is much weaker than that in ""Local Hero"" or ""Gregory's Girl,"" and the situation set up (popular morning dj trying to expose the gritty heart of Glasgow ice-cream wars) is not nearly as universal. Plus there are serious plot weaknesses--I was never convinced that the ice-cream gangsters would try to get Dickie Bird to mediate their 'war.""That aside, the soundtrack is very enjoyable and much of Forsyth's skill is in evidence here. It's much better than most of the sludge trotted out by the film industry, especially for the holidays. Worth buying--but don't pass up ""Local Hero"" for this one."
4,A pleasurable read,"A good selection of writing covering a wide variety of topics. Each story was a delectable mystery as to what was coming, because although the common theme is food, the topics varied considerably. All contributors are highly polished, professional writers, so the quality of the writing is excellent. It wa a great winter bedtime read, to be parceled out, one story a night."
5,Surf Music for the Thruster Age,I missed seeing these guys in Santa Barbara one evening but my buddy got their CD and loaned it to me. I was really bummed that I missed that show after listining to Essential Reventlo. This is a perfect blend of heavy metal chunk mixed with classic reverb surf guitar. Check out El Pendejo or the haunting Andromeda Sex Lounge. This is as good as it gets for modern surf music.
4,"Not exactly surf, but not bad, either!","I saw these guys at the International Surfing Museum in Huntington Beach, where they have Sunday surf concerts, and picked up their CD. Those who came to hear Pipeline and Miserlou were scratching their heads, but the open minded completely dug their spin on surf and Instro. It's not really like anything out there, and IMHO, it's VERY cool. If you don't like one song, wait for the next one---it'll be completely different. Highly recommended."
1,Dont Bother,"Item falls apart after 1st wash. Badly made. More like a leotard than a shaper. Doesnt do what it claims. Comfortable, but doesnt shape anything."
3,"A Great Little Book, If You Want An HP Collectibles Summary","The amount and variety of Harry Potter merchandise never ceases to amaze me. Rather than collect much of it, just buy this book. The pictures are detailed and printed on high-quality paper. Want to see what some foreign editions look like? It's in here. Want to find out some basic info about J.K. Rowling? It's in here, too.Sure it resembles a catalog, but what book of collectibles doesn't? Its biggest flaw is being out of date, thereby leaving out quite of bit of recent merchandise, but it's a good start. The focus is on items based on the books, not the movies, which is okay by me. I'm late to HP fandom, so I get to see what I missed out on.I also had the advantage of seeing this book in a store, so I knew what I was getting. It would be nice if there were an updated second edition, as this one only scratches the surface of HP collecting."
2,Not very good....,"I liked the books that CheckerBee Publishing have done in the past like beanie babies, but this book did not have the information I expected. I would not waste my money on this, unless you want to keep track of everything you have bought, but it is not even current...."
4,Recommended,"The banter in some sections can be downright annoying. I think this is an attempt to make it more entertaining, but if you are not a professional entertainer, stick to what you know. It is a lame attempt to make the video more colorful but simply fails and makes the tape seem less professional. Having gotten that out of the way, I think this is a very good resource for someone wanting to learn to sing the Blues. It has some very logical and useful exercises and approaches to understanding and executing the Blues. I do recommend it for these reasons. One thing to be aware of is that the keys are switched at some points between what I believe the piano player is playing and what the vocalists later sing, and this might confuse you so be aware that this will happen later in the tape. I thought that this could have been thought out, or at least explained, a little more professionally as well."
5,Bought 'em Blind.,"I replaced an OLDER pair of Advent Maestro floor standing speakers. Over the years the foam surrounds on the woofers disappeared completely so much so that when I gave them over to Goodwill, there was nothing holding the woofer to the magnet but the center mount!Normally, I fret, start, stop, and fidget with speakers. These are the most important parts of a stereo system. On the other hand, I have always had good luck (and longevity) with Sony.After comparing the price of these units with others in the same range on the market, I decided to take the plunge. They are great! They handle the nuances of a Mozart Sonata as well as the tub-thumping rips of my favorite country artists with no complaints. Some people 'might' find that these speakers are not flat. Fine. When listening to your favorite music, ratchet down the bass control from the 'flat' position.At this price, you cannot go wrong. These are wonderful speakers for the money."
3,OK Speakers. Too big!,"These speakers are extremely tall. The sounds is pretty good, but definitely not as good as I've heard in other speakers much smaller than these. I guess they are acceptable."
3,Good For The Money,"I replaced a set of older 2-way KLH speakers with these and hoped that I'd be ""blown away"". I wasn't. I'm using these speakers only for my home theatre, which I don't use that often, so I didn't want to spend a lot. I was able to get decent sound by hitting the Loudness button on my receiver, and then turning down the treble until they sounded balanced. My old KLH's gave a cleaner sound, were more efficient, in a much smaller size."
5,exceptional speakers,"After blowing my Infinity Reference RS420 speakers, it was time to buy a new set. After reading many reviews and specs I decided on the Sony SSM-F750H tower speakers. I took a chance by not listening to them personally beforehand and buying them online; boy am I glad I did! Most reviewers say they sound great for the money, I say they sound exceptional no matter the price, though it is nice that they are reasonably priced. I've played all types of music CD's since they've been hooked up, and they all sound great, both at low and high volumes. Just thought I'd thow in my 2 cents. Oh by the way, don't even think of using the supplied speaker wire, it's pretty flimsy stuff."
4,floorstanding speakers.,"My system is bumpin without these speakers, so i just bought them for the looks. They look amazing with my new couches. When i hooked them up, I didn't expect much, but they surprised me. The mids sound so good. Highs are alright. lows weak unless you TURN IT UP! I have a powerful powered sub and center channel speaker so all I needed was the mid so I am set. Give these a try. Their cheap! You can't lose. Not for the die hard audio guys."
3,"Trippy, strange","Featuring their new guitarist, the legendary Scott Mitchel Putuskey (ex-manson guitarist for 'Portrait of an American Family', 'Smells Like Children) Jack Off Jill comes back after releasing thier debut CD to put out an EP, filled with metal and techno influences that make your head spin. Sorry but i dont like techo remixes too much so i discounted points becuase of that. 'American Made' is an awesome remix, and so is the first remix of 'my Cat.' For the $6 i spent on this CD, it was well worth it for some of the good points of the CD, and just to complete my collection of Jack Off Jill CDs."
3,alright:)!,"pretty good.but too much techno remixes make me sick!but i bought the cd knowing it would be remixed so its not like i didnt know..but i wanted to try it out.plus i love JOJ so i need the collection to begin!...well its pretty good..some songs shouldn't of been remixed..because it made them sound to clubby and poppy...American Made is a good remix,(tweaker)....and My Cat Meow Mix is really good!but the ending is really long...but its actually a little better then the original..Girlscout should of been either left out of this album as far as a remix or remixed by someone else..Cumdumpter is alright,original version is 100% better tho,My Cat auto. speed mix is not good..just too mixed up.Poor Impulse Control is alright but the original has more emotion and excitement...:) buy this cd if your a big JOJ fan,if you already have JOJ-SDAS then buy this because its interesting..but if its your first JOJ cd..go for Sexless Demons and Scars (SDAS)."
2,A Great Disappointment,"Like several of the more positive reviewers, I'm a lifelong Toto fan. And I did all I could to try to get into this album, but I just never could. Yes, there are a couple of good songs - ""Angel Don't Cry"" is a pretty good rocker, I love ""How Does It Feel"" and ""Holyanna"" is a good closing song. But for the most part, the band just didn't deliver an album that could stand up to the body of his previous albums. It's not the style that was weak - the songwriting just seemed to be lacking on this one. I would likely give this album 3 stars for almost any other artist...but Toto was capable of a lot more than this."
3,Hidden gems from Toto,I realyy didn't want to lower the rating on this CD. The rating is only lower because of the number of truly great songs. Not all songs on a CD will strike that special chord. But this CD is worth those hidden gems. I use these songs to pepper playlist with other artists from the 80's. People always ask about the Toto songs.Dave
4,Fergie Frederiksen EneRgiZes Toto,"With his solid powerful soaring vocals, Fergie Frederiksen SHINES on this CD both as a lead vocalist on tracks like ""Endless"" and ""Isolation"" and a background vocalist on songs like ""Stranger In Town"" and ""Holyanna"" This is one of the few CDs that I listen to for both the music, the lead vocals AND the background harmony vocals!"
2,boring harder rocking album,"I quite like the first side of this album. David Paich has a soothing voice and his lead vocal on 'stranger in town' is effective. 'Carmen' is also a memorable number. Lukather's ballad 'how does it feel', is the only sort of ballad song here, but I am not too fond, though it is ok.The second side is just hard rocking bland song after hard rocking bland song. Tracks 6-9 just blur in my mind as the same sounding. 'Holyana' is better by Paich again, but not enough to rescue a boring album that has none of the trademark melodies and ballads that Toto are best known for."
5,yes toto writes more rock than 'hold the line' and 'rosanna',"yeah, this album it seems gets recieved in one of two ways -1. that its really one of there better ones or2. its just not that good.For me, i'd be in the first category. there is alot of energy on this cd, i think its the most fast tempoed.Tthere arent really any 'rosanna' type tracks on this album, its more about its overall consistancy and solidarity that i rate it so highly. this album shows that toto were a rock band, in contrast to something like farenheit or IV. this albums isnt as varied as much as IV, and really stays more in the rock genre so i thinks thats why people dont really like this one. if your looking for pop singles i'd look elsewhere. but if your looking for rockier toto, id say this is a must."
3,"Isolation, not one of Toto's most memorable moments","This is the fifth album from Toto, following their major success IV which received six grammys and sold millions of copies worldwide. However, the follow up, Isolation, wasn't that great. Lead singer Bobby Kimball had left, being replaced by Fergie Frederiksen (ex LeRoux) who had a great voice but who didn't really fit to the music of Toto. Obviously the band had some problems trying to match the success with their previous album, most of the melodies are quite forgettable, although the arrangements and the musicianship is top quality as always."
5,L'album des Fans de Toto !,"Fergie Fredericksen remplace Bobby Kimball, tandis que Mike Porcaro remplace David Hungate.Ce cinquième album sera bien loin de connatre le mme sort que le précédent.Car, malgré l'entrée de "" Stranger In Town "" dans le Top 30, Isolation se vendra moins que Toto IV...Pourtant il ne demeure pas moins comme un grand hit pour les fans, un album très abouti, très Rock, ceci grce à l'énergie insufflé par Fergie qui en fait un album très rythmé que l'on ne se lasse pas d'écouter.Un Must !Best : Carmen, Isolation, Mr Friendly, Holyanna, Lion.Plus d'info sur : www.totofrance.com"
4,A fine album,"Isolation was one of the final pieces I added to my Toto collection. At first listen I wasn't sold. But recently I re-listened and discovered that it is one of my favourites.This is a fast paced collection of songs, with only ""How Does It Feel"" as a worthy ballad to slow things down.There seems to be a real mesh between the keyboards and guitars on this album that I love. Paich absolutely roars through some keyboard solos that made my jaw drop.""Angle Don't Cry"" is the best cut on this album, but from top to bottom it is extremely strong. A real ""must have"" for the Toto fan.While ""Tambu"" remains my favorite Toto album, Isolation continues to impress me.This one is money well spent."
3,"Not Their Best, But Does Have Great Energy","This was quite a departure from Toto's previous album ""Toto IV."" To me, this was their first album that didn't end up sounding dated. Listening to it now, it sounds pretty fresh and full of energy. Fergie does a good job with the singing. ""Isolation"" is a great song. Good album."
5,Rock on!,"Toto's followup to Toto IV gives a nice hard rock feel. Steve Lukather has a great guitar sound, and there are three keyboard solos in this album. ""Stranger In Town"" is a cool song, and ""Carmen"" rocks! This is a highly underrated album. It's better that you think! Toto, by the wau was in a pickle: Bobby Kimball had left the band, however replacement Fergie Fredericksen does a good job filling in."
3,incomplete album,"This album has four great songs ( Tracks 3,4,6,and7), but the other songs are plodding and uninspiring. This CD has a lot of power in the songs and is well done over all. They just needed to take some time coming back from the success of ""Toto IV"" to make a complete record."
3,How to tell a story,"You could say that Mr Fogelberg is not exactly an icon ""down under"" but the first time I heard ""Tucson Arizona"" (in the early 90s) it reminded me of other signature stories in song. For me and my family (including head banging teens) this is our favourite song and ranks (for me) along-side Bob Dylan's ""Hurricane"", Marc Armond's ""Days of Pearly Spencer"" and Jerry Jeff Walker's ""Mr Bojangles"". It's a pity I can't get too enthused about the rest of Dan's work - it's OK but fairly middle of the road. However ""Tucson Arizona"" is a real gem."
3,"decent one, but sounds too far away from us","this is the first Dan's CD I ever bought other than other compliations from Sony Records, bought in 1993, a year before Definite Collection (Hong Kong version) and The Innocent Age (one of his best)Believe In Me were widely played among Hong Kong radio stations in 1984-1985, along with Windows and Walls, that's why I purchase this CDbut in turn this is a little disappointment, sound is not so outstanding, and sometimes this one has a feeling that he's way too far away from us, that's why I give 3 starsthough such disapppoiment, I still recommend Tucson, Arizona, and Believe In Me, both are very good and relaxing, espcially the former, you can imagine a short drama in this one"
3,Too maudlin for me.,"I'm a Dan Fogelberg fan. That does not mean that I like everything that he's put out. I tell you what, after hearing Windows and Walls and Gone Too Far I feel almost like killing myself. I get the point about visiting your parents and grandparents, but jeez...I am currently ripping my collection to mp3 and it's the first I've even looked at this CD in years. I plan to keep it though because there are other songs on there that are classic Fogelberg."
1,A mess,"""The Language of Love,"" which was Fogelberg's last big hit single is catchy. With the guitar line, meldoy, and snappy lyric, it is a winner.The rest of the album is a mess, with one song, ""Tuscon Arizona (Gazette)"" being quite possibly the most lyrically embarassing song Fogelberg has ever compossed."
3,Big ugly vertical scratch,"Believe Candlelight USA released some defective CDs. Bought the 2005 reissue of Indecent And Obscene twice (once from a Utah based seller, another from a Massachusetts based seller) BOTH had the same exact HUGE vertical scratch running half the length of the CD ... Candlelight USA has so far blown off my inquiries regarding this. ... So, if any of you other Dismember buyers get stuck with a defect copy."
4,Scathing Account,"This book is a scathing account of Ariel Sharon's military and political career through 1985. Benzaman does a convincing job of portraying Sharon as a callous, self-serving, lying, incorrigible egomaniac. I started reading this book with a moderately negative view of Sharon. The Sharon portrayed in the book is far worse than my initial impression. The shortcoming of the book is a lack of attribution of sources and references to supporting material. Consequently, any conclusions based on the book must be provisional."
3,Does not turn back on,"Its a 5 if you are using it for home use. Its a 2 if you've got unattended devices plugged into it.I would give this a 5 if it were not for the fact that if the battery dies after a prolong outage, then electricity is restored, the ups will NOT turn on. So if you have servers plugged in this UPS that run 24x7, prepare to jump in the car, head to the office to push the ups on button. This is really a thumbs down for me. When I called support, we all had a good laugh as to why the ups was designed this way."
4,century,"this book is an great read with mistery, suspence and some confussion. It has a great plot and is one of the books that once you have finished it you want to read it all over again 4 1/2 stars."
4,"Not Perfect, But Good Regardless","The Best Revenge is #11 in Stephen White's Alan Gregory series. While for me it wasn't the best, it certainly was good. The plot seemed a little contrived and took a while to pull together. But all in all, very good and I look forward to the next one."
2,Could be better,"Unbelievable plot and characters really hamper this story, which started off with some promise and became more and more silly as it went on. This was my first White novel. I'll try again, and hope that his other work is stronger than this."
2,"weak, silly",The plot wasn't well fleshed out and was fairly weak. I expected more from this author after I read Blinded. I recently just read Missing Persons from him and it was even worse! I will not waste my time and read another book by Stephen White.
2,One of his weaker efforts,"I've read three of his books, and this is easily the worst. Storylines are never a strength in his works, and that is most obvious here, where the ending looks like something he just pulled out of his rear end when he couldn't come up with anything better.The strength of his books for me has always been Gregory, his relationships, and his practise. Those elements take a backseat in this book to featuring some other characters who, I hope, we won't see again in other novels.You won't miss anything if you give this one a pass."
3,Too much vulgar language,"I checked this book out at the local library. I had never read any of Stephen White's earlier books, but it sounded like the type of book that I would enjoy. I was very disappointed at the large number of vulgar curse words that was used throughout the book. I would not read another of Mr. White's books. I would not stay in the company of anyone who spoke this way, so I do not wish to read this type of language for pleasure.Other than that, the book was interesting enough with some unexpected twists and turns. It did keep my attention."
2,Not his best,"I've read most of Stephen White's other books, and found them to be a quick read of better-than-average quality, so when I saw this one I picked it up.This book, however, fails to live up to the ""better-than-average"" status of his other Alan Gregory books. The plot here is thin and ridiculous. The characters are given improbable motives and even more improbable handicaps and abilities. This book felt rushed, and lacked the depth of plot and intrigue of his earlier books, almost as if White is getting tired of being narratively hemmed in by the slightly dweebish, boring Alan Gregory. After this book, I know I am."
5,Stephen White keeps Gregory tops,"The Best Revenge is Stephen White's latest Alan Gregory book. Gregory is a psychologist in Boulder Co. with a wife who is an Asst. DA who also has MS with a new baby, and best friend, Sam Purdy, who is an honest cop, as well as good coworker and good neighbors who put their two cents in when needed.This is the best White novel to date that keeps you guessing until the last word. Very timely - dealing with implications of right and wrong and who determines justice and who dispenses that justice. Gregory deals with burn out of his practice, and what is the level of confidentiality when lives are at stake and his patient/dr. confidentiality tears him up on many levels.White makes Gregory more human and it is a step in the right direction -Yiassou Stephen White! Hope your Mother is doubly proud of this one - she is his #1 fan and he keeps earning - that means great taut writing type of earning his fans with each effort."
3,"""I recognized it, but I didn't. And then I did.""","I'm a sucker for psychologist mysteries. It's the perfect combination. Both the crime and the job allow the writer to really explore character and its quirks in a deep fashion. I have also enjoyed the Alan Gregory books in the past.This one was not the best that I have read. It *does* raise some interesting elements-- particularly Gregory's ambivalence to his own patients and his ability to suspend judgment and help treat potential offenders. However-- I can't really say much about the flaws without spoiling the plot-- aspects of the ending could have developed that theme more fully, except that I have the feeling that White pulled his punches. I also found the plot line with Kelda quite difficult to believe-- parts of it felt written to be sensational rather than written to fit the story. It didn't quite work.All in all, some interesting bits-- but bits that didn't quite gel for me. Won't stop me from picking up another book by White in the future."
1,Plot? Characters?,I have never read anything by Stephen White but saw the number of books that he had written so I bought one.The plot is beyond far-fetched. The psychologist is a joke. Sorry - pass on this one.
2,Felt like I was Reading an 8th Grade Novel.,"Corny beginning, corny middle, and definitely an absurd ending. This was my first and more than likely last Stephen White book. His style of writing is as simplistic as a Judy Blume novel. I truly felt like I was back in 8th grade and this was on the mandatory summer reading list. Lesson learned for any of his future writings!"
4,Some evil stuff in these pages!,"I found this story pretty thrilling and there's some seriously twisted stuff that comes from one of the characters. This story held my interest and I blazed through the chapters pretty quickly, but my only complaint is that it runs long in some areas. I wasn't interested in the many geography lessons and weather lessons of Colorado, but if you skim over that, you will enjoy the rest of the pace of this story. I will definitely read more of Mr. White's books. :)"
4,"Excellent, but","This is a very good (5 star) mystery, with twists right 'til the end. BUT, the reader has an annoying habit of dropping his voice for what I suppose he thinks is an appropriately dramatic delivery. It turns out to be just irritating and hard to hear."
3,Typical Flawed White Book,"White's Alan Gregory books always disappoint, as far as I'm concerned. They start off wonderfully -- usually from page one the reader is hooked and the book proves irrestible. Until about two-thirds of the way through: then, the wheels come off. And at the end, the book that started with such promise ends with silliness. I've read most of White's books and everyone ends unsatisfactorally. This one is no exception, although I will say that this time White manages to dampen down the bumper sticker philosophy and tiresome left-wing carping that characterize his other books. White obviously puts a lot of effort into his books and he knows how to craft a fast-paced story. I just wish he wouldn't go off the deep end so easily."
2,Horrible and Confusing,"Unfortunately for this book, it didn't get interesting until I was almost 3/4 of the way done. I had read a lot of great reviews about this book that it was a real thriller and full of suspense. It wasn't. I found that the story jumped around a lot and you never knew who was talking since it switched from 1st person to 3rd person all the time.The idea behind this book was good; Tom Clone, a convicted murderer gets released from jail because of new evidence found by FBI Agent Kelda James. Kelda recommends her own therapist, Alan Gregory to Tom. Soon they are both telling Alan their deepest secrets and Alan becomes the one who slowly pieces together a very strange puzzle of events.I admit, the end of the book came as quite a shock to me, and I'm sure it will do the same to you."
5,I Absolutely Love This DOLL!!!!,"I think this doll is a fabulous representative not only of Marilyn Monroe and many ""Femme Fatalle"" stars of the 30's and 40's, but of my favorite ""Blonde Bombshell""....JEAN HARLOW. This doll especially reminds me of ""Dinner at Eight"" (See it if you have a chance). This doll is gorgeous from her ""Platinum Blonde"" hair down to the flare at the bottom of her skirt. Beautiful hair, make-up, jewelry, and gown, not to mention her faux fur stole!!!!"
3,Barbie goes Hollywood,"This is not a toy that is meant to be played with....it's a beautiful tribute to the glamorous screen stars of old Hollywood. The doll reminds me of Marilyn Monroe,whom I consider one of the most beautiful women that I have ever seen.Mattel's attention to detail,is as always,outstanding.It seems though as if Mattel is capitalizing on the success of another doll that is giving Barbie a ""run for her money""...Gene Marshall.This particular line of dolls,dressing Barbie in costumes from various movies that she ""starred"" in,is the same premise that the Gene line is based on.I love both dolls,so it's a real struggle for me to pass this doll by when I see her...but due to space limitations,I must.The quality that has become synoymous with Mattel is definitely here,as is the value.I've seen this doll ranging in price,....I think anyone who enjoys beautiful things would enjoy this doll....she would make a gorgeous addition to the collection of anyone who enjoys fashion dolls."
5,Fantabulous!!,"This particular Barbie doll is just beautiful! I don't think any words could even express the sparkle in my eyes when I look at this doll. I have always loved dolls, especially Barbie!! When I was growing up, who didn't want to look like MM? My friends tell me that I am a walking, talking Barbie. I guess it paid off - I was a exclusive model for Kim Dawson for 10 years, starting when I was 13. Your dreams really do come true if you try hard. I would love to have this doll in my collection.Signed - ""Dolly"""
4,X for 'mature',"this is later phase X and should be considered in this light. not exactly the punk aggression of their first two outings, yet still packs a punch. more of a contempletive album with such songs as 'new world' and 'bad thoughts', this album also sees X stretching out musically. true love part 2 is almost a funky samba beat track. don't get me wrong there are still scorchers on here like 'i see red' and devil doll. in terms of playing, you won't find better from any other X album. more fun is the result of a band that's fined tuned after years together."
3,"Billy Zoom's finest playing, but....","songwise not their best. Three or four of these songs are really great, but some are really self-indulgent. It's ironic that the playing is at their tightest, but lyrically it's nowhere near as compelling as any of their previous records. Worthwhile if your a fan....And by the way, is DJ Bonebrake the most under-valued drummer EVER?"
3,"Better than most stuff, but really the beginning of the end","Some good stuff here, but honestly folks, does this even remotely compare to Los Angeles, Wild Gift or Big Black Sun? I don't think so. It starts off strongly enough, and Exene's vocals on ""Breathless"" make me want to smash into everything in sight, but after that, the whole thing kinda just, well, sits there. And by the time our dynamic duo is warbling ""I've Been Working on the Railroad"" in the last dreadful cut, I'm on to something else."
1,Terrible movie!,"This has got to be the lousiest movie I've ever watched! VERY POOR ACTING, with a dumb plot. It was a waste of good money, and time!"
3,ONCE OVER VERY LIGHTLY,"Crankshaw's ""The Shadow of the Winter Palace"" is a very readable survey of attempts to modernize Russia in the 19th century against the stubborn gravitational pull of autocracy. Russia needed democracy built up from below, if only to bring new, able men into government and broaden the consultative base of Tsarist rule. One Emperor after another let crucial opportunities slip until at last the pressure to reform became ungovernable. Though always fun to read, Crankshaw is relentlessly superficial and adopts a smarmy, jokey tone completely at odds with the material. One looks in vain for the gritty details of Alexander II's great reforms, particularly how serfs were emancipated, and the new men who came forward during that period are never profiled adequately."
3,An overview of Amboseli National Park,"We're planning a trip to Amboseli, so purchased this video to watch. It was quite disappointing -- especially if you're accustomed to some of the incredible footage and narration from Planet Earth or productions of similar quality."
3,It's ok for beginners...,"I consider myself at an intermediate level, but this beginner to intermediate workout, as it calls itself, was much too easy for me. I would imagine it would be very effective for someone just starting out, but Tamilee Webb is a better buns of steel instructor. Give her ""I want Those Abs"" video a try. It's AMAZING!"
5,Great value for price,I was required to purchase many x-actos for school and this is the best value I found. The came to my house quickly and worked great!
4,"Good, clean juice","I've tried many different brands of Aloe Vera juice. This particular brand sin't as harsh tasting as others. I bought it because one of my singing students uses it. And I like it has the esiac herbs in it too. However, I can honestly say i can tell a difference from taking it, and though it deserves better than a three-star, not quite sure it deserves a four, but that's just a matter of opinion. I base my rating (really a 3.5) on the price. Way too expensive to use if you plan to do 3-4 ounces per day. If it weren't for the price, I'd buy several more bottles and give it a few months to see the effects it would have on my voice and body. But, for now, I'll have to find an alternative.Bottom line, if the price doesn't bother you, then this is probably one of the better, natural choices for decent tasting Aloe Very juice."
4,Load of useful information but computer version is faulty,"I bought the computer version of this book. The software containing the textbook is slow, unmanageable and unintuitive. However, the text is very useful and cases are interesting. From the tests I was given in class, that were taken directly from the book, I can say that the book was not put together in earnest. It appears that the tests/answers were not thoroughly checked and this makes me question the quality of the rest of book. By giving it 4 stars I'm in fact rating the text as opposed to rating my experience with the computer version of the book. I would give that 2 stars at most."
5,"Accessible, practical, insightful!","This book is not only clearly accessible to those who may not be familiar with business jargon and bookkeeping methods, but it is also tremendously insightful for those who are seasoned entrepreneurs. Jack has clearly been through this process many times, and lays out all the steps to starting your own entrepreneurial venture. He also identifies pitfalls and ways to help circumvent them."
4,Supernatural Western!,"Story revolves around a killer for hire who just may be the devil or the devil's advocate, the good guy is the local saloon owner/bartender instead of the usual harness maker and gunsmith that Lauran Paine is so fond of writing about, a very good book even though I am not a fan of the supernatural genre, this all takes place in and around Calabasas, New Mexico, and unlike your typical western there is no rancher's lovely daughter, Rourke the saloon guy is an older man like as in many of Mr. Paine's stories, I understand that Mr. Paine wrote as many as 1000 books with 900 or so published, you should be able to say that writing was his life. I have read most of Zane Grey, Ernest Haycox, Luke Short, Peter Dawson, Louis L'Amour and William Macleod Raine's books, I don't think that I will be able to say the same of Lauran Paine, he wrote under many other names which you can look up under a.k.a. on the Lukol search engine."
1,It just didn't draw me in...,"After reading this novel, I wonder if maybe the flow of it was lost when it was translated into English. It just felt really choppy to me, and even though I attempted to give it a real chance, from about a quarter of the way in I just kept wishing it was over so that I could read something more interesting. Any person with half a brain can figure out who the ""Soothsayer"" is the minute the narrator meets him, and the big ""secret"" that is discovered at the end is completely anticlimactic. To put it simply, if you're looking for a blase kind of story, go ahead and read this, but if you want something that's a little more fast-paced, with a conclusion that might shock you, this novel is NOT it."
2,Definitely not a page turner,"The stroy is educational in respect of da Vincis' work. however, the ""great mystery"" of the masterpeace is not belivable. the narrator of the story is boring, the story appears to be 50 pages too long for it's plot. The ending of the novel too theological. Would not recomend this book."
4,I'm getting full,"I think the public has had enough food from this supper of Christ.This probably will be the last book on the holy grail I'll read. Enough. There may be better books written than The Da Vinci Code, but come one, The Code is the pilgrim. You can't take its place.This book by Sierra is good because it throws you in the middle of the whole fabrication of DaVinci's painting. We actually get to hear The Master talk. This book is what we needed. We needed to be thrown into the past, and not just in forms of flash backs; we needed an entire novel. Good job, Mr. Sierra."
3,People you need to know first.....,"If you don't already have some familiarity with the Borgia family, Duke Ludovico (Il Moro), Savonarola, the d'Este family to name a few, you will really be lost and much of the gist of the book with be missed. I love history/hist. fiction and have a fair understanding of all those and more and I still felt confused at times. So many huge people with huge historical impacts are merely mentioned in passing that if you don't already know what it means, for instance, that Savonarola criticized the Borgia Pope, well, you'll be even more lost. Lots of names thrown at you fast. Great story but hard to keep straight. Characters so vast and underdeveloped it's hard to care. If you already know and care about this time period, you can plod through and be glad you read it. I was. I was also glad it was over, though."
2,Poor read,"This book was $1 at a discount store and I paid too much at that. I was determined to finish the book but it seemed to take forever. The story never developed. Maybe I missed something, I don't know..."
2,What a disappointment!,"This book is so tedious that when the ""big surprise"" ending turns out to be something you've known for quite a few pages, you have to wonder if the author got tired of it himself and just stopped, rather than crafting an ending."
2,Promised more than it delivered,There was a lot less substance and fewer new historical facts than had been promised in the hype. A few interesting new facts came to light but not enough to warrant reading a full length novel. The writing is stilted and feels like a translation. I was disappointed after hearing an interview with the author who was more entertaining and informative than his writing proved to be.
3,So-So Book,I received this book from the publishers via a contest.Too many undeveloped characters & not enough info on the Gnostics.Not a bad read but would like to see more definition of the proponents of both sides of the truth about Jesus & Mary Magdalene.
3,Not What I Thought....,"If you purchase this book and are hoping that its going to be similiar to Dan Brown's DaVinci Code, prepare to be dissappointed. Perhaps its a case of good writing, lost in translation or maybe its just me, but I found this book very dissappointing. Although the plot is intresting, it is over written, and not in a pleasant or entertaining way. It drags at points, and is forgetable. Bottom line, if you're looking for a fun, easy read; this is not for you."
1,"I recommend that you don't read it,","I recommend that you don't read it, unless, like me, you are a sucker for even bad code-breaking cloak-and-dagger stuff.All of which I might have been able to forgive if the book had at least partially delivered on its promises of being a literary thriller. But it didn't. There was a little bit of code-breaking that went on, but it was all too pat, too cut-and-dried with no room for suspense, no theories tentatively advanced to be proven wrong later, no breakthroughs"
2,The Secret Supper,"Rarely do I not finish a book I have started reading; however, I didn't finish this one. It was boring!"
4,Poor Leonardo!,"Ever since ""The DaVinci Code"", Leonardo's reputation has taken a pounding from authors jumping on the church conspiracy bandwagon. This book is better written than most (and much better than anything Dan Brown has published), and the mystery tends to be a bit absorbing. Unfortunately, the suspense (as it were) can only carry you so far, and when the final ""mystery"" in uncovered, it is a real letdown to the reader. Make no mistake, though, the book is entertaining to read, and as long as you don't take it too seriously, you most likely will enjoy it."
4,The Secret Supper: a visual feast,"I bought this novel some time ago but held back reading it during the frenzy of 'The Da Vinci Code' and similar offerings. I am glad I did so: as I am sure I would not have enjoyed it anywhere near as much.Yes, this is another novel based on coded mysteries. It is also a fascinating view of the times in which Leonardo da Vinci lived, and incorporates some details of his life and paintings.The novel moves quickly, but in small chapters. While I solved the puzzle well before the end of the book, that was simply because I'd been paying attention to the clues being offered along the way. Solving the puzzle prematurely in no way diminished my pleasure in reading the novel.I enjoyed this novel immensely and had no difficulty in imagining Leonardo in such a role.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
2,A lot of pages with little to say,"In all, I think this story could have been written in about ten pages in The New Yorker, or some publication like that. Mr. Sierra simply took too long to get to his point and rambled about topics not relevant to the crux of his book. Because it was originally published in Spanish, part of me wonders how much was lost in the translation. Then again, that would only account for a better read, not a better plot."
3,Difficult Read,"I was quite excited to read the novel but found it difficult to follow - too many characters and too many sub plots. I was disappointed to find at the back of the book a list/description of characters. If that had been at the beginning, it would have helped tremendously.There is no comparison between The DaVinci Code and this book, The DaVinci Code was excellent while The Secret Supper was okay."
1,It WON'T fit a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-W170,"This cable is USB standard on the computer side, and a micro scsi on the other.A Micro scsi looks like this from the end.-__/__\ <-- Not flat and long like required. You can't make it fit, either.The Sony Sybershot requires a longer and flatter connection.On the good side, it was mailed to me immediately and came in perfect shape.If this is what you need, you'll get it quickly.Also, I got an online label from the company to return it, tho I pay postage."
1,bad,"Does not meet the required technical specifications and requested by the Osi came to use and I'm sorry for this because the product is not in conformity with the specifications, which sent over the Internet"
3,Good but thin,"The cable DOES have the ""Sony"" logo on it, in accordance with its advertised name. The cable looks very precisely made but as for me it is too delicate, too thin. It should have a higher mechanical protection. I used it a couple of times already and it worked perfectly.The cable was shipped to me with a week delay - eight days after I placed the order. The shipping/handling fee was very high - $5.09; there were just two $0.44 stamps affixed to the envelope (first class delivery). I bought another, two times as heavy a cable from xfish Online and that fee was $1.37 only. The cable was packaged in the mailing envelope only (not enough protection) and there was no invoice included."
2,"Might have been good, if it had been compatible","I have a Sony Cybershot DSC-T9 camera and needed a cord to connect it to my computer. After attempting a search for compatible cords I found that this cord was listed as being compatible with my camera. It isn't. I had to return it. Amazon was wonderful about it, but I wish the cord had worked. Be careful about compatibility issues here. (I ended up buying a Sandisk Image Mate 5 in 1 reader for my memory card instead of trying for another cord)"
3,"Hole Saw requires 1/2"" drill if you want to clamp to it","The hole saw can be used with 3/8"" drill but you will have to fasten it to the pilot drill bit (not included). If your going to be drilling heavy items a 1/2"" drill is a must. Other than that its a very solid hole saw."
1,Junk,"A piece of junk!!!! The broiler top warped on the first use. Maybe the roaster pan & rack will be useful in the future, but do not buy this to use as a broiler pan."
3,Blind Man's Buff,"Running Blind lives upto the title. The author sends the hero on a mission where the hero is literally 'running blind'. He is the victim of a double agent within his own service, and is called back from retirement for a last job against an earlier nemesis in the rival KGB service.The background is the Cold War, and the antagonistic feelings of those times may be a bit anachronistic. But given this limitation as a period piece, the book succeeds in leading both its hero and the reader into a Blind Man's Buff.The end is still a surprise, and sort of a shock.A thriller from start to finish, and guaranteed reading from in one sitting from start to finish.Also very good repeat value.The language is very mature and builds up each event to a pitch required for the novel to sustain a certain momentum."
4,Desmond Bagley's Running Blind,One of the first Bagley's I read umpty ump years ago. Loved the page turning cold war era thriller. It introduced me to Iceland and have loved adventure stories about Iceland ever since. One thing missing in this copy I believe i could be wrong in the original is maps very important to follow the story. So I found one copied it and stuck it in the back for future reference..
2,So many better ones that this,"I believe wholeheartedly in this cosmic ordering and it does work for me. However this is not the book I would recommend. I agree with the reviewer who said that perhaps there was something lost in translation. It appeared to be a series of very disjointed chapters, that said all kinds of things, based loosely on the Cosmic Ordering topic to sort of pad the book out, after covering the initial information. It did not flow at all, and it even hada "" smug "" feeling to it. I did not enjoy it at all, I found it very hard to read, not with level of difficulty, but with flow of sentences and topic. I have given it two stars, but this is at a push. For a better, more logical guide, try "" The cosmic ordering kitchen "" by Patricia Crane. ( She does a great newsletter too )."
1,Waste Of Money,Do not waste your money. This book is not even close to what I thought it would be. Due to the high ratings it seemed like it would be great. A better book is Excuse Me Your Life Is Waiting. It goes into detail and you cannot fail. I gave this one star because it I could give less.
4,cosmic ordering,Not as good as I was expecting. . . Wasn't as explicit as I thought it should be. .But readable any way.
4,The Cosmic Ordering Service,"Some really good examples of what cosmic ordering is all about. I read it because Noel Edmonds recommended it on T.V. Not really so well written, in my opinion, in terms of the grammar etc. But Hey! Different writing styles used, and a bit confusing in places. Seemed to give lots of quotes from the book 'Conversations with God' by Neale Donald Walsh at the end. So started out original then had lots of quotes from an other book. But I love CWG books anyway, so I think that it is a good thing."
4,Entertaining and worth a try - the reading of it as well as the ordering.,"Barbel Mohr is of the opinion that you can order anything you want from the cosmic ordering service and have it delivered be it the man/woman of your dreams, the job of your dreams or even a castle to live in. All you have to do is formulate your wish, then let go of the outcome and finally be open for the delivery because the package may not look like what you ordered but it is. At least that's what she claims.I think positive thinking works. I think following her approach works to make you happy (being aware of your wants and needs, formulating them and then letting go of the outcome) but I think that's very hard to do and in some cases impossible. Nonetheless it's an entertaining book to read, it has many good ideas in it and I would definitely recommend it to anybody who is open to the idea that his or her destiny is in his/her hands rather than somebody else's hand."
2,Does little to inspire,"If you're holding this book in your hand, then you're probably asking yourself ""why?"". Some books draw on centuries of esoteric thinking, but not this one. The title reflects what was potentially there, but the text in this altogether very thin book simply falls flat."
4,Great Book,I already own an audio version of this book and got this as accompanyment. I love the easy to understand concepts that Barbel gives. She really makes using the Law of Attraction easy in todays world.
4,Cosmic fun.,I really enjoyed the book. The author takes a light hearted approach to manifesting your desires. Someone looking to be more control in their life might find this book to be a less intense method as it is written to encourage people to have fun with the concepts of manifestation. I would recommend it to everyone.
4,"Very Good Book, but a Little Rough in the Translation","This book has a great deal to offer, but I had the sense that something was lost in the translation from German to English. Some of the statements just end a little too abruptly. This small issue aside, I think this book is a good introduction to manifesting the things that you want out of life. By following the guidelines that are set forth and tailoring the process to your own personality, you can make substantive improvements to every aspect of your life from the interpersonal to the financial. Since I tend to struggle with lingering doubt, it's best for me to start small. A generally positive person would be able to start with larger requests. The instructions are clear and manageable."
2,"nice, neat, not worth buying","Although a pretty little book, (you will probably read the whole thing in an hour or so. little is right)it is horrendously written (but I think it is simply a bad translation from the original german), and more importantly, could probably have its essence conveyed easily in less than a page: if you want something, then just have faith, feel good about it, and order the cosmos to deliver it too you. Yes, that about sums it up.Now, it really is that simple, but if you need her little stories to help give you faith, buy the book. Buy don't expect any 'order' to this 'ordering' manual. It skips, jumps and digresses like only the most inexperienced writers do.A much better book in this subject of 'abundance/manifesting' would be 'Excuse me but your life is waiting', a brilliant study into the process of creation that is much more readable and far better written than this."
1,Just a Knock-off,"This book attempted to do what The Universal Chaos Matrix by Babra Moel did much more elegantly. Don't waste your time with this one, you can find an e-book version of UCM easily by clicking around on the internet for a little while."
3,The Cosmic Ordering Service by Barbel Mohr.,An interesting book about the author's use of The Cosmic Ordering Service rather than a step by step instruction book.
5,Very Positive,I thoroughly enjoyed the entire book. Stephen wrote the book in an easy to understand format. I intermittently re-read certain chapters that connect with me to the tee. Great job Stephen. Thank you. You are obviously clued up and very intelligent.
5,"10 Stars to the merchant, Amazonchief!","I received the book in perfect condition within a few days of ordering. Since then the merchant, Amazonchief and I, have developed a strong and rewarding friendship. I've never dealt with any online merchant with half as much integrity and character as this man! His services are worth twice their weight in Gold! Unfortunately a slight problem with the book developed. (A manufacturing defect,) Amazonchief IMMEDIATELY corrected the problem, no questions asked. I know of no better merchant than this man, my hat is off to him!!! Chris Sianis (Omaha)"
1,Why all the great ratings?,"This is a very small book with alot of hype and alot of quoting from other books. It says you'll learn how she used the Cosmic Ordering Service to gain her dream job, the ideal man, money, health, even a castle to live in. All she did was put in her Cosmic order and the Universe provided! How lucky for her that she gets what's she wants so quickly just by asking. If thats all we had to do, we would all get what we wanted too and we wouldn't need her book now would we?"
3,TRUE CRIME,I HAVE PUT THIS BOOK ASIDE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. I HAVE SIMPLY BEEN TOO UPSET BY THE STORY TO FINISH READING. IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW PEOPLE LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS ARE HAPPENING RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. THE FATHER IN THIS BOOK WAS A VILE HUMAN BEING.
1,The worst book I've read in a VERY long time...,"I ordered this book because I stumbled across it on Amazon, and the reviews made it sound interesting.It's my policy (Ingrained in me by my parents)to always finish a book I've started, and so I did. Hoping that the end would justify the rest of the meandering and uninteresting story.Well, the end was just as insipid as the beginning. If you want to buy this book I have a FREE copy you can have if you pay the postage. But, don't say I didn't warn you."
5,Leonard Berstein - Young People Concert Classics,"Songs Include :""The Carnival Of The Animals"" - Saint Saens - Leonard Bernstein Narrator""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" - Dukas""William Tell Overture Finale"" - Rossini""The Young People's Guide To The Orchestra Op. 34"" - Britten ( Variations and Fugue On A Theme Of Purcell ) ( Beginning ) ( Master Henry Chapin Narrator )""Peter And The Wolf Op. 67"" - Prokofiev - Leonard Bernstein Narrator"
5,"PACKED WITH SUSPENSE, HISTORY AND VIVID CHARACTERS!","Through the eyes of a boy battling history, Escape Via Siberia tells the long overlooked story of Eastern Europe during WW II. This willful and wile boy somehow manages to always give the slip to the Nazis and Stalin's forces, which both hunt him throughout Eastern Europe. This true story packs so much suspense and history that it should be made into a movie! It is a must-read for historians and lay audiences alike."
4,Very interesting,"This true story of a young boy's life as a hated Jew in WWII-era Poland was worth reading. Some of the information was new to me, such as the information about the founding of the modern state of Israel. I also had never heard of the Tehran Children and their arrival in Israel.The reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is that the sentence structure sometimes made the book difficult to read. I'm not referring to the passages where the author was quoting the man's broken English, but to other passages that were sometimes awkwardly phrased. There were also commas that appeared in totally inappropriate places.But overall, this is a book I would recommend. Thank you for writing it."
5,Exquisite voice for exquisite songs,"These songs are so beautifully sung and arranged that you can't imagine any other way of hearing them. He's an incredible talent, here produced with the most sophisticated taste. One of my favorite albums of all time. Essential for Strayhorn fans."
1,What??,"I bought this CD based on several things: glowing reviews both at Amazon[.com] and in the LA Times, plus the fact that I loved Dreamgirls and almost all jazz and blues. However, when I put this CD in, I took it right back out after hearing some of tracks 1 and 2, thinking that there was a mistake since a girl was singing. Yes, I know what a tenor sounds like, and usually I love them. I listened to most of the rest of the CD but could hardly bear it. I love lots of these songs, but not Mr. deHaas' ""variations"". The sounds rise and fall to the point where I had to turn the sound down and then up...... Parts are so slow I thought they had gone somewhere..... I am sure Mr. deHaas has a lovely voice, but this CD is not for me.....At first I thought I would put it in as background music at home, but, honestly, people would say ""What is that??"" so I'll just put it away......"
5,History in Limbo,"To The End of the Solar System is an excellent primer on the nuclear rocket -- the history that might have been, and still waiting to be. It is a story even avid spaceflight fans may not have heard. Dewar presents a very readable account of the visionary engineers, project managers, and politicians who developed the first nuclear thermal rockets. The narrative covers the politics and engineering (with supplementary appendices) without being overwhelming. It explains why the nuclear rocket is superior to chemical engines, yet why the world failed to embrace it. The technology has lain dormant for decades, but is quietly making a revival in NASA's project Prometheus and elsewhere. Learn where it all started and where it's going; read To The End of the Solar System. It is well worth the price of admission."
1,Why is the Kindle version so expensive????,"I'd love to read this book but can't justify shelling out so much money for either the hardback or Kindle versions. Who sets the prices for these books, I wonder?"
5,Peanut Butter and Jelly: A Play Rhyme,Great book for preschooler and kindergarten. It is written about their favorite sandwich. It is fun to read and the pictures are hilarious. The kids can sing along while turning the pages.
5,"An intelligent, balanced discussion of the ethics of hunting","The author presents an intelligent, balanced discussion about the ethics of hunting arguably one of the best ever written. Kerasote, hunter, environmentalist, and ethicist, presents three examples of hunting: subsistence hunting with the Eskimo, big game trophy hunting, and a personal hunting trip. Although an intensely personal book, Kerasote provides a much wider and reasoned view of both sides of the hunting issue than is normally presented in most discussions on the subject. Some of his envronmental arguments are particularly telling."
1,faith based droning,"yes, very ""challenging"". is that snob code for ""it stinks""? endless one note droning, much pounding and clashing of symbols going nowhere, the screech of sopranoes better employed elsewhere. no faith based free pass here, this aint the republican convention. as homer simpson would put it...""BE MORE MUSICAL!"" now gubaidulina is a genius; offertorium, canticle ... , stimmen... ,the bassoon sonata, quasi hoquetus, rejoice, homage a ts eliot, concordanza ...all works of genius.lets get her back on her medication, or into a nice rest home."
5,Good Eats at the Laugh-eteria,"Whether you want to groom your kid (or grandkid)to be a literary star or not, this is a good place for you both to start having real fun with words. Think of this book as the literary equivalent of an open fire hydrant on the hottest day of August. These poem-songs tickle and tease like jets of cool water. Best for kids between the ages of 5 and 10, 'tho not too old for a 4 year old or too silly for a 12-year old."
5,FUNNY!,Our six grandchildren ages 9 to 3 love this joke book. The older ones read to the little ones and everyone laughs. Excellent book!
4,Courtesy of Kids @ Teens Read Too,"In this entertaining poetry book, Douglas Florian pairs rhymes with simple black-and-white illustrations on subjects ranging from siblings, fishermen, April Fool's Day, homework, camels, the dangers of drinking ink, and much, much more.With poems that are simple enough for beginning readers, and large drawings that would be great for coloring, LAUGH-ETERIA would be a fun gift for any creative child.As an added bonus, some poems are a little gross and creepy, such as ""Brain Drain"" and ""Monster Meatballs,"" which is sure to make reluctant readers want to pick it up!Reviewed by: Jennifer Wardrip, aka ""The Genius"""
3,Drawings?,"I really enjoy Douglas Florian's poetry and I thought most of his poems, in this book, were funny but his drawings kill this book! I love his books that have his paintings, they have a ""primative folk art"" quality that has a warm and fuzzy feeling to it. These drawings are so bad it distracts from the poetry. My advice to the publisher is get someone else to do the drawings! Don't pay for the ""new"" copy try a used one, see what you think and then cut it up, use a glue stick in a spiral notebook and you can still enjoy the poetry!"
4,A very decent little book,"This booklet will be a treat for anyone who has been to Sanjusangendo and seen its 1000+ life sized wood sculptures. It is a thin saddle-stitched photo album, with the majority of images being black & white, though a few of the more impressive works (and cover) are in color. Most of the book highlights about 2/3 of Sanjusangendo's ""front row,"" which are old world gods serving as the guardians of the 1001 figures of Kannon inside the world's longest (390 ft) wood building. Although tourist photography is not permitted inside Sanjusangendo, many bootlegged pictures can still be found scattered throught the internet. Regardless, the concise presentation of ""Sanjusangendo : National Treasure"" (name + brief sentence/paragraph per photo) makes this book a must have for anyone who wishes to revisit one of the most important and breathtaking landmarks in Japan."
1,A waste of money and time,"The movie was weird and short , it was'nt worth paying to watch at all ! The movie is something that I would'nt recommend anyone to watch '"
2,a sad waste of resources,"Dillon is great in the film and his band but this cd lacks quality and variety. It sounds as if all are one song lifted directly from a bad copy of the film. Go for the canadian cd companion to the film, if you can find it."
3,"Informative, Interesting but No Pictures","I enoyed Patricia's book about her life and adventures on tv show,...Every Body Loves Raymond. I especially liked the parts about the show and the funny things that happened while making it. But I was very disappointed that there were no pictures. Maybe it's just me, but I like an autiobiography to have pictures other then the one on the cover. She is not the comic writer that Ray Romano is with his books, but I still enjoyed it."
2,Disappointed,"Since I love Everybody Loves Raymond and I am from Cleveland, I really looked forward to this book. I was vastly disappointed. I know she got a lot of help from her brother, a columnist at the PLAIN DEALER because it seemed as if more than one person was writing it. The same thing was said multiple times---if I had a dollar for every time she said her mother died when she was 12 (I'll bet this was mentioned 12 times) or that she was from Bay Village or Cleveland (another 12 times)---. It was as if she wrote a few chapters and forgot what she wrote. It was distracting. And where were the pictures of when she was younger? NOT ONE PICTURE in the entire book. And the humor was cynical rather than funny. I would not recommend buying this one."
5,"Honest, Fun, and HILARIOUS","I went out and bought this book (and I rarely buy hard covers) after I read an excerpt of it in PEOPLE magazine. I started reading it on a Tuesday and finished it by Thursday evening. It was full of witty one liners and made me laugh out loud numerous times, but at the same time, it had lots of heart and could be rather poignant. As a writer myself, it's nice to know that someone who works in front of the camera can write as well (and must know how important the writing is to actors). I was impressed that the book didn't say: ""Patricia Heaton with INSERT NAME OF GHOST WRITER, i.e., someone who did the actual writing"" as you often see with books written by celebrities. This book is lots of fun. I highly recommend it!"
5,PATRICIA HEATON,"WHAT A REFRESHING MEMOIR. I JUST LOVED IT. SHE IS SO WISE ABOUT THE ART OF LIVING, FAMILY AND NEVER FORGETTING HER CHILDHOOD AND FRIENDS. SHE ALSO REALIZES HOW WISE HER PARENTS WERE AND HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN THE LESSONS THEY TAUGHT HER. HER SENSE OF HUMOR IS DELIGHTFUL SHE IS SO SENSIBLE. SHE REALLY HAS A GIFT FOR WRITING. HOPE SHE WRITES ANOTHER BOOK."
2,"Irreverent,absolutely!","I'm very conflicted about my feelings after reading Patricia Heaton's book! Some of what she writes is humorous,but much of it comes across as down right MEAN! Calling Donald O'Connor an old coot is neither funny or nice. The man has talent she could only dream about! She writes about her growing up when life was more simple. I can relate to that! I understand her loss when her mother died when she was so young. I applaud her praise for the stay at home moms. What bothers me is the fact that she gripes so much about sending her kids to private school. Parents should be involved in their children's school whether it's public or private. Teachers need parental support! They are NOT your child's babysitter or nanny. Maybe,she should give the public schools a chance. Let her kids see what the real world is like! I can't believe I bought this book!"
1,Nobody loves a stuck up whiner,"An aggravating read that caused a major loss of respect for this actress. She is no writer, and apparently lacked a capable editor as well. She is crude. There are too many references to sex and drug use. She seems to consider financial success the difference between winners and losers in life, and lacks the grace to realize without her current job she would still be a financial loser. She's a loser to me anyway. This book is not worth reading. Skip it."
4,What a refreshing read!,"A dear friend mailed this book to me ~~ and I have to say, it is a light and refreshing as well as honest look at motherhood and Hollywood. I have always liked Patricia Heaton in ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" ~~ and definitely like her better after reading her book. With a light touch, she talks about her life before and after becoming famous and being a mom. She tells her story with humor and grace ~~ and being a mom of two boys, I can relate to her experiences with motherhood and wifehood. What a fun book!This is one of the better autobiographies I have read in awhile. Patricia is a down-to-earth woman who happens to live in la-la land called Hollywood. And after reading this book, I wish her well in future endeavors ~~ perhaps more on her family life would be wonderful!If you're looking for a lighter and fun read to while away some free time, I highly recommend this book. It is a sure bet that you'll finish this book and beg for more. She's that good.12-05-02"
5,What a hoot!,"As a person who is familiar with Cleveland, Ohio, it was a riot to read Patricia Heaton's memoir. She's quick and witty. I couldn't put it down and found myself laughing a lot. So much so, that other people in the room had to ask me what was so funny. If you are a mother, too, this book is a perfect read for her honesty and ""helpful"" advice!"
2,"I really WANTED to like this book, but . . .","As much as I enjoy her television work, I did not enjoy this memior. There was way too much whining in this book. Aside from the occasional food item, it seems like nothing stands up to Ms. Heaton's standards. Her jobs were terrible, the bosses were jerks, the places she lived in were hideous, etc. Even now that she ""has it all"" she complains about the Hollywood lifestyle. And her husband!! She calls him about every name in the book, in the book. I know she was trying to be funny in doing this, but when it appears that you're trying, then you're not being funny.A glaring omission in the book is the lack of a passage to tell the reader ""how to get a job like mine"". We hear about all of her [bad] jobs, but there is very little said about how she obtained the Everybody Loves Raymond job, or for that fact little mention of her Raymond ""family"" (except to degrade them for not being as faithful as her actual family).I cannot recommend this book."
5,Must read,We have many Soul Mates. One of the keys is to be able to be able to know when you found one. Enid is a caring soul who flows with energy and it's definitely there when you read the book I would reccomend it heavily
4,language of light,"Openng with a very tribal, yet light hearted track, this cd will get your feet jiggling if nothing else does. I listened to it at Yahoo, and have been moved to buy it - sitting in the kitchen, it began and I lost my seat to the joyful beats."
3,AFI's rerecording is incredible,"AFI's rerecording is full of new energy and breaths life into the song. I've not been able to find these on the internet anywhere at all. Recommended either if you were around in the scene 10 years ago and like reminiscing, or weren't and want to know what all the fuss was about!"
2,Too over the top on most bags,"I am very particular when it comes to purses and totes that I make as gifts or carry myself. I was disappointed to find there were only four of the eighteen patterns that I would consider making. The other bags/purses are either too small or too exotic for my tastes. They are odd shaped or just not a useful item for me.The book contains templates if they are needed to create the bag/purse. Graphics are included along with the written instructions. There are materials and cutting lists and sections that explain handles, straps, closures and image transfers.All in all, if you are as particular about your purse/bag as I am, you will do better to grab an individual pattern than to be disappointed with this book."
3,"Great inspiration, lacking in pattern simlicity","I like the book, love the ideas and the inspiration. The variety is great with zippers and open tops and metal hex closures. A great way to expand your bag making! The patterns do not come full size or with dimensions to fudge them to the right size. Instead, you are given a pattern shape and instructed to ""Enlarge 111%"" or ""Enlarge 150%."" Kind of kills the spur of the moment creativity, unless you have a large copier in your house or pre-copy all the patterns ahead of time."
4,Nice Assortment,"I think this book is well done. It would be improved by adding an inch-square grid to the patterns to make manual enlargement easier, but I've had good luck with my scanner and printer. As for ""too too"", the point of making your own handbags is to come up with something unique to you and your personality. All of these bags can be customized to express your personality."
5,A must-read book if you are making a decision on HRT,"After perusing several other books on HRT and reading their reviews, I am changing the rating from my previous review to 10.""Natural Woman, Natural Menopause"" offers refined information for helping yourself through menopause beyond what is available in other books. Knowledge of natural plant-derived hormones is necessary in order to make an informed decision on whether to use HRT or not, and this is the only book I know that gives sufficient information to add to the equation.Before you either start hormones or decide they are not for you, read this book. If I decide to use hormones, based on the evidence presented, they will indeed be the natural ones"
1,Cheapest made pad on the market,"I know alot about metatarsal pads and have purchased dozens. These pads are not only one of the more expensive to buy, butthey are lterally constructed of a piece of cardboard and a cheap small inner pad with a piece of fabric thrown on top.I would guess it cost about 50 cents to make. There was also absolutely no thought put into at least creating an anotomiocally correct design. They just threw this together to make money. How this company can sell these is beyond me.Pro-tec should be embarrassed that their name is on these. If you read this and still go ahead and buy these pads..don't say I didn't warn you.It's literally like taking a $10 bill and throwing it into a river. Worthless, at best."
3,metatarsal pads,"These pads do help to relieve my neuroma pain, but the covering on them soon comes off which leaves the pad sticky and this makes your foot sticky."
2,Too Small..made it uncomfortable in my shoes,"At first when I put in my shoe, I thought the pain was going to go away..as I continue my day...I had to take the shoe off...it made my foot hurt even more......I am not saying it might not work for someone else but as for me..I was not happy....I wish you all the best."
3,zack's reviews,This book is not a beginner book butit is agood book when uknow how to ollie& all beginner tricks.
1,Not helpful,"My son didn't find this book helpful at all. He said that he already knew how to do most of the tricks and even if he didn't, the instructions were not clear enough to be able to learn them."
3,"Acceptable, not really portable","I am a Mac bigot, but needed a cheap notebook for my real estate business. This product fits the bill, but the battery power is useless: for a test I just left it unplugged doing nothing, and the battery died after about 90 minutes. However the screen is good, the speed is acceptable and the WiFi works flawlessly. Buy this if you need to get a cheap notebook - avoid it if you actually need to work away from a power outlet."
1,To little story and not enough action,the story was way to slow and the acting was just average.--My wife and I did not enjoy it at all.
1,Slow at best,"Slow and needs a script. What more can be said? Every thing was there but a storyline. Seems to go nowhere, and in fact accomplishes just that."
5,Pioneering Africa,"This has been on my wish list for some time. Hayley Mills, remembered from so many Disney movies, is a full grown adult with a young daughter who is fascinated by the people and experiences of Africa.The story is simple but touching. The family is conned into a coffee farm in Africa and like an American western, encounters all types of difficulties in getting started. A neighboring family and a dashing white hunter provide a romantic love triangle. There is spectacular scenery and wild animals. Then it all goes wrong thanks to WWI."
5,perfect cards for dog lovers,I was thrilled to find these having bought a box of them YEARS ago and wished I had gotten case. Looked up the photographer and found them here. The stock is thick quality paper. As I write this I am thinking I better re-order.
2,What a poor recording!,"This recording is a ADD Mono remastered recording of music recorded from 1947 to 1950. I suppose there is merit in listing to the Stokowski Symphony Orchestra conducted by Stokowski himself. However, I was looking for an excellent HiFi listening CD using current technology and not remastering of old, mono recorded music. Chandos 9259 is a much better recording of some of the same Bach music (certainly not a 1:1 match). Probably the best ever recording of Bach transcriptions is the Chandos recording of Leonard Slatkin's transcriptions."
5,I loved this book!,I've read many books on management over the years. This one is the only one I would have needed. It's brilliant and yet easy to read and fun to read.I bought one for every manager in my company!
3,needs more consistence,"i thought i would find a consistent reformed arminian presentation about the argument of john here ( like picirilli uses to do, and does it pretty well, in other commentaries in this series ) instead ..on every key passage ( verse to be more specific ) theres an editors note with some sort of explanation and then it returns with the commentary itselfwhich doesn't deal with a lot of others ""not-so-key verses""but overall ..an ok commentary(pd: excuses about my lack of grammar)"
2,Flimsy construction,"I'm expecting this handle to break off after a month or two. It's really flimsy -- thin cast metal construction. Much lower quality/lighter/flimsier than the handle I purchased from my local DIY chain store, and the DIY chain store version was only half the price. I'm really stretching to give this product the benefit of the doubt with two stars."
3,Good treatment of multucultural & gender issues,"I use this book in a Psychology of Adolescence graduate course with licensed teachers. We use it as ""background information""-- the chapters guide discussion and allow teachers to reflect on their own students' development. Grad students react favorably to the text."
3,Good Text Book,"This book is informative and cheap, two of the things that I like the most. Excellent for use in college classrooms - highly recommend."
3,A good read. Some fresh ideas.,"I was finding it hard to pass page 100. After that however, things started getting more interesting. I liked the clear character outline, and some of the details given in the book of various things seemed to come from a new perspective.It is predictable, but not a bad book to be added to the Forgotten Realms archive."
3,Not quite worth your time or money...,"I didn't even finish this book. I got about six chapters into it and had to set it aside because the boredom factor had set in.The beginning of this book was believable enough-but it was very slow. Things seemed to take forever, and the plot kept going around in circles. The characters, most of them, were very detailed and had good lives, descriptions, etc.; but I was not fond of this plot. I am not one to continue reading something if the crisis has not set in by one hundred pages into the book, and it doesn't in this book. It is about the same length as all the books in the Cleric Quintet by R.A.Salvatore, but nothing starts happening until after 100 pages...in those books, the crisis happens only about 50 pages in.Maybe you'll like this better than I did, and maybe I'll go back some day and finish it-or at least try to."
3,So-so,"The novel starts off not exactly as a typical FR novel; it reads more like a generic fantasyland. The feel of the Realms atmosphere is sadly rather lacking in the beginning. The book doesn't leave a lasting impression, and frankly it was a tedious read rather than entertaining. The prose and style are not that bad, though, hence the three stars. But it's not a book I'll read a second time.One thing. Richard Baker seemed to have made an error - he called the language of the elves ""Tel'Quessir"" (!) instead of Espraur. Tel'Quessir = The People, as in the elves, not the language. *sighs*"
4,good standard story,"I read this story directly after barely surviving Elminster in Myth Drannor and found it rather refreshing to know that there are still some ""normal"" folk around. You accompany the wizard Aeron as he learns and matures and unlike Elminster doesn't spring almighty from somewhere or else. The college of magic though was transplanted directly from the American educational system to the Realms. Quite obvious I think, at least if you only know colleges from American television series. Overall well worth reading."
2,Borr-ring!,"Why I keep reading Kienzle is the biggest mystery here. I guess I keep hoping for something better than the last book, but they just keep getting more and more boring and mired in theology lessons. Instead of feeling as if I've just read a murder mystery, I feel as if I've just attended a lengthy lecture course on theology. I come away exhausted and wondering where the excitement, the tension, and the suspense were hiding. Clearly, Mr. Kienzle misses preaching. His characters deliver multi-paragraphed speeches, not dialogues. And the pesky quotation marks, while grammatically accurate, are confusing. I'm constantly checking them to be sure who is talking. I used to look forward to Kienzle's novels, but I think ""No Greater Love"" has cured me."
3,Has its moments--3.5,"In their original forms, the ancient Greek myths were not bedtime stories or pretty tales for poets. Rather, the gods and goddesses embodied primal forces, and those who encountered them had reason to fear their power. Awe, terror, and brutality were what the gods were about. Jack Ketchum's ""She Wakes"" follows this tradition., with a reborn goddess making her sexual, bloody way through modern Greece. The characters were annoying at times, which definitely detracted from by enjoyment of the book, but the supernatural elements were intriguing enough to keep me reading."
3,Just not that great..,"This book, for me was hard to follow. It seemed like the story just dragged on and on. There were exciting parts and it was a good story in certain parts but the ending was just so confusing and far out there. Not impressed. I read ""The Lost"" and absolutly loved it, though."
2,Eh.,"This book was dreadful. I did get some enjoyment out of it and enjoyed the kills/violence, but eventually it dragged so much that I lost interest. I didn't even both to finish. Ignore this one- there's a lot better horror out there."
3,Average Book,I'm a big Fan of Jack Ketchum. The first half of She Wakes felt more like a true jack ketchum novel that usually explores the realistic fears that most people have. This is represented in this book by presenting the fear of meeting and having a relationship with someone that you later find out is crazy. This part of the novel is done very well and I almost couldn't put it down. Then at the climax of the book Jack decided to change it to a supernatural story about a Greek Goddess or vampire that's pure evil.The supernatural portion of this story is absolutely not needed and ruined the realistic tone of the whole book.
1,She wakes but I sleep,"Jack Ketchum turns to Greek mythology in this book involving tourists in Greece that meet up with a supernatural element. There's not much more to summarize that others haven't covered. I truly like the Ketchum novels but this, for me, was terribly boring. No matter how much I wanted to accept the story, I just kept finding better things to look at than this book, like my wallpaper or lawn. Really all I can say is I'm glad this wasn't the first Ketchum novel I read because I wouldn't have read any others. There's the old saying, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all... with that, goodbye."
4,wonderful toy...,what can i say it is little people...my kids like playing witht his toy...not much educational value..but that is what we have the other toys for..they like to see how many things they can get in the back of the garbage truck..
4,Great Toy,"My son is completely obsessed with cars. Needless to say this is one of them. This car was bought for him during last xmas 2002, and the batteries still work. So I think this is a great toy for a toddler who loves cars. Oh and he likes to hide things in the garbage chute.Nicole10/9/03"
3,Mr. Trash man,"My son received this for his first Christmas, & almost a year later, he doesn't play with it too often. He likes taking the trash man out and using him with other Little People toys. He also like taking the trash can in & out of the back, but that's about it. I'd recommend other Little People toys over this one."
2,Not worth the $$$$$,My husband and I like to watch soft porn...of which Office 2 could technically be. Its not the greatest story line and the X scenes go on forever and the acting is terrible (not that I should expect anything more on a porn movie) Not worth the $ there are better movies out there than this one.
5,I like it,This lighter is very nice. I buy it as a gift for my friend. Maybe I am going to buy another one. It is realy good as a gift.
2,Too heavy,"The colors are absolutely gorgeous and the thread count high (making for a very soft fabric), but the comforter is so heavy that it is impossible to sleep under it. I wonder whether it isn't defective. Wrote to the vice-president of Raymond Waite's company - mvdira@nyc.rr.com - but have yet to hear back. It is so heavy that it could probably be used as a weapon. A total waste of money as we can only use it to decorate the bed during the day. Anyone else have this problem?I wish a lightweight duvet cover could be made, using the same striped fabric as on the comforter (minus all that heavy fill)."
1,Might as well use spaghetti sauce,"This sauce is heavy on the tomato, light on the curry flavor. I tried it for the first time, and didn't like it from the moment I opened the jar. It smells like an Indian spaghetti sauce, and doesn't taste much different. I wish I had a Fresh and Easy near me, because they have the BEST jar Tikki Masala sauce."
5,The Day the Cow Sneezed,"What a treat for the Flora-deprived post-20th century children! My own children loved each Flora title that I was able to find on used book sites, and I keep The Day the Cow Sneezed close at hand to remind me that the children of the 1950's had a pretty awesome introduction to influential art of the period. I'll be watching for more of my favorite Flora books in new editions."
5,Simply the BEST!,The wife & I were lucky to have visited & stayed at Gangivecchio and met the owner and staff. The main thing was to be able to eat their daily creations.Their PASTA book brings back a lot of memories of their cooking and is a treasure to us. It makes a very special gift also to someone that appreciates great Italian food.
2,Il Preferito di Peter flop,"Bought the book and the first recipe I tried somewhat flopped! In Peter's Timballo pg. 158, the recipe calls to start with one cup of olive oil/8 tbl of butter and then saute the onion, etc. In hindsight it seems I'd been better off with one or two tablespoons oil and 2 of butter as the recipe went awry from that point on. All in all the dish was saved at the end, albeit a bit soggy and just somewhat like the photo on pg. 159. The great frustration is trying to find an email address of the author, publisher or agent to get this corrected or to verify the ingredient's measurements were correct. Having spent the better part of 1/2 a day putting this dish together I'm reluctant to try another with this author."
4,A New X,"Many X fans lament the passing of the sound on ""Under the Big Black Sun"" and the loss of Billy Zoom on later albums. It would have been wonderful if X had stayed on the track of their earlier albums. Things change, however, and the reality was that John and Xene were talented enough to tackle a variety of styles, and create a sound that evolved in unexpected ways.Here, the songs have much less of a punk feel. The results, while not as striking as the classic earlier X, are terrific.""See How We Are"" is an achingly beautiful song - the cd is almost worth owning for that alone. ""Fouth of July"" is a great rock song. These are songs that will have you hitting the repeat button on your cd player. A very solid work by one of the best bands of the eighties."
4,A definite return to form,"After the overproduction and comparatively weak songwriting that turned up on their previous album AIN'T LOVE GRAND, this album (while not exactly a return to form) is definitely in major step in the right direction. Billy Zoom's absence is felt but Tony Gilkyson does an excellent job, to his credit. The title track is one of the most affecting songs John Doe has ever written, and ""Surprise Surprise"" continues to be a full-tilt crowd-pleaser. There's only a trace of 1980s production excess on this one (unlike AIN'T LOVE GRAND), which makes this album very much a return to form and a maturation at the same time."
4,This is the way forward.,"(I'm posting this here because I accidentally placed my review for Beaches and Canyons under Black Dice's Creature Comforts album. No matter, both are excellente!)After a few releases of great analog-wrecked noise madness and harsh reality, Black Dice have uncorked something incredibly fresh and welcome.This is where Morton Subotnick gets to hash it out with Boards of Canada.Really astonishing record, this. Timeless. And new. One of the 2-3 best things to happen in music this year if not the decade. It's a giant leap ahead of their peers into a new genre. Beaches and Canyons is endlessly more fascinating to listen to than any electroclash triphop drum'n'bass glitch postrock trance jungle techno you've heard. Plus it rocks more and surprises more than anything from those genres I am aware of. Too excellent. Wait no longer.As highly recommended: Creature Comforts."
1,Hoochie Baby Clothes,"I realize I should have looked at the clothes a little closer, but I did not notice how tiny they were until they arrived. I truly did not think they would fit on the doll. When my daughter put them on her, the shirt showed the baby's entire midriff and the skirt would have made Britney Spears blush. I was appalled! This was for a baby! I took the clothes away. I think it is absurd to make this style of clothes for a BABY doll! You can be certain I will not be purchasing anything else from this line."
3,Acceptable.,"I ordered two of these at $33. each, so I guess I really lucked out on the price. The bleat call is probably the most realistic. While the packaging says it is supposed to be a doe announcing that she is ready for the rutting buck, it sounds more like a fawn. The rattling feature is a close second, but it lasts for quite a long time. The snort/wheeze? I am not so sure that it is loud enough and the grunt is too loud. The grunt sounds more like a tree frog trying to imitate a bull frog. I will keep one for myself for no other reason that I feel like all deer respond to a fawn, even if the buck is merely following a concerned doe. I will send the other one to my nephew."
5,Not Just a Legacy - A TREASURE!,"This must be one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard. This is not just due to Michael's BRILLIANT voice (absolutely incredible) but the writing, musicians, back up singing, it has every ingredient of a Grammy Award winning album. It's too bad it wasn't a mainstream release. Be ready to LAUGH, CRY, and REMEMBER with the intense emotional content brought to life by who must have been one of the greatest male vocalists ever born.... If you aren't the type to past judgement, and just want some brilliant singing and music, this album is for you."
4,Really helpful piece of software,"I'm not sure why the previous reviewer thought ""where is the book?"" to be an artificial question - it's really rather a practical question. I ask it constantly, and sometimes it's ""on the table"". It's true the dialogues have the flavour of the language lab. But there are so many good things here - word-for-word or sentence-for-sentence translations at the click of a mouse, recordings played at word, sentence or paragraph level, concise grammatical notes where helpful. For me the best is the word-by-word then whole sentence ""listen, repeat and then compare"" drills that do help one improve one's pronunciation and fluency. And for a language that otherwise has only textbooks or books like ""Learn the Kazakh language in 70 steps using 200 sentence models"" (!), this is a fantastic aid.[Stop press: Sept 2005] I've just been sent notice that intermediate and advanced courses are being released. I've not seen them, though."
4,Fresh-sounding hip-hop in the 00's. Oh yes,"Grand Buffet is a consistently hilarious rap duo with a cool Beastie vibe. Their 2002 EP, Undercover Angels, is even better. This is a quality CD."
3,Very Well done,"Most of the songs are great and people always ask what I'm playing. There is one song that is just not as smart as the rest of the works ""Blow""(album Version) can be overlooked. Other then that is a great to see the return to smart MC's"
4,Impressive!,"This 1983 release displays Saga as an incredible outfit capable of dishing out a stunning combination of progressive and new wave;great intensity,emotion and thoghtful lyrics make this album an instant classic.Warning:it can be addictive!"
4,Strong Overlooked Effort,I think this one was overlooked probably because it followed the very popular World's Apart. I do think it is a great CD however. There is a lot of energy and great prog/rock songs. I love Flyer and Pitchman. Scratching the Surface is also a great song. Overall this CD is a great effort that has been sadly underrated. It is also important to mention Rupert Hine who I think is a great producer. I love his work with Rush and Saga.
3,HEADS or TALES...original Rupert Hine production was INCREDIBLE...but.....,"Heads or Tails was a production masterpiece. Rupert Hined drenched the album with his precise, elegant, rock/pop edge (as he did for the Fixx, Cafe Jacque, and himself, Stevie Nicks, Tina Turner among others). However, this remastered version is thin....the fullness of the original mix has been completely lost....I'm very sad...I loaned my original to a fellow music lover, who, conveniently never returned it...so, I purchased this remastered version recently. I'm thrilled to have the CD, but, very disappointed in the remastered version...I will have to go and find the original version now. Doh."
3,Good album,"Heads or Tales is Saga's fifth studio album. It was released in 1983. Along with the original nine songs, this 2003 remastered edition includes a bonus track, ""Catwalk (Extended Version)."" Altogether, I find the album's songwriting to be solid, the musicianship to be skilled, and the sound quality to be satisfying. The material is in a stately pop rock musical direction. I like Michael Sadler's smooth, industrious singing. My favorite compositions are ""Catwalk"" and ""Intermission."" The sophisticated-sounding ""Catwalk"" sports cool guitar work, while ""Intermission"" displays ambient, relaxing keyboard playing. The CD booklet includes the song lyrics and several color photos. The album cover artwork is creative. The CD is almost 48 minutes. Heads or Tales is a worthy album from Saga."
5,Saga in top form,"This is one of the best from this time period. The band is in top form all the way through the disc. Other 80's bands couldn't even come close to this level of prog-rock. This remastered edition comes with complete lyrics, photos and an extended version of 'Catwalk' which is 7.44 in length. I did find a mistake however: Social Orphan/Tracks 6 is listed as being 5.28 in length, when it is only 3.25. Sound quality is very close to the original domestic version. A metallic-sound best describes it, electronic drums(perhaps a bit too much)I was hoping for a little warmth added to the remastering i.e.: some bass added around 35hz would have been perfect. This disc has a very hot high-end, which you may or may not like. Still a very good disc from the Saga canon. 10 Tracks/48.00."
5,great book,"Although I do have a few complaints about the book, I really liked it. Most of my complaints involved wanting more - more artist commentary, more concept drawings, that sort of thing. The book has an introduction written by Hayao Miyazaki, a section with concept sketches, a section with concept sketches, backgrounds, and character designs, and a section explaining how computer graphics were used in the movie. This book even has the movie's screenplay. I really enjoyed the concept sketches, which show how original ideas changed to create the final product. For instance, a sketch of Zeniba and Yubaba shows how much Zeniba's design changed - she looks more normally proportioned than her sister. Later in the book, there is an explanation for why the change in Zeniba's design occurred. I also enjoyed the computer graphics section, because I would never have noticed any of the things they pointed out on my own. I foudn it fascinating, they way they blended cel art and digital art so well."
4,if you loved the film you will enjoy the book.,"More of a coffee table book than a detailed account of the development or production of the movie, I found it to be a charming addition to the dvd. Kids may especially enjoy looking at it, as they can look at the details and talk about what the characters are like and just have some fun with it. While not cheap, it is fun!On a more mature side of Japanese art/history, and unrelated to cartoons, is the great book Samurai Warriors by Stephen Turnbull. The artwork is amazingly accurate to the times. I include that here only because several of my friends liked both when they say them on my table, so maybe you would too!"
5,Simply Amazing,"I ordered this item after seeing the movie cause I knew right off that it was going to be amazing, and I was correct. This guy is amazing! I hope that he comes out with lots more movies and art books that are just as great as Spirited Away. When reading and looking over this book it was like I was watching the movie all over again. But enough of my blabble, buy the movie and book, and you'll see for yourself just how amazing both really are."
5,Grab your musket!,"Here's a piece of history they didn't teach you in school. At a time of public dismay over CEO shenanigans, Thom Hartmann recounts a crime far beyond anything even the Enron boys could aspire to: the corporate theft of the Fourteenth Amendment. Unlike many historians, Hartman is a great story-teller, and this tale of Gilded Age intrigue will keep you reading. His account of how a key Supreme Court decision was rewritten by an overreaching clerk -- and the stunning consequences of that act -- will anger you even as it makes you reconsider much of what you thought you knew about our history."
3,A NICE AND THOUGHT PROVOKING BOOK,"excellent, respectable book and read, I would recommend this for anyone seeing the injustice in this world especially today in our court system and decisions being made for the American people and this country. But remember, the world of liberal government control is also a form of socialism and greed when people do not want to work for their living. If you goal is to live as a slave or self sufficient, I recommend you think about it, take time to read this book"
5,"I recommend ""Unequil Protection"" as high school reqd reading","Thom starts with the East India Company of the 1500's and its ""corporate"" charter, and walks you through to today. Then he presents you with several sources and methods or starting a grass-roots movement to change the ""Santa Clara"" decision, which gave corporations personhood...excellent, excellent."
3,"Not bad, but.............","This is halfway decent, but it's your typical soft-core stuff. The movie is also known as ""Marilyn Chamber's Naked Fairy Tales"", and is shown periodically on Cinemax. From what I can gather, Seduction Cinema got the rights to it, and added some scenes featuring their own actresses (I don't recall seeing the Misty Mundae scene on TV). I don't how 'naughty' this is exactly, but these women sure are naked."
2,"If you lie soft core, stick to rentals on this one.",Not worth purchasing...may be a decent rental for fans of the genre.
4,great wheels!,"My 11 month old was facinated by anything with wheels, but it was really hard to find a car for babies. We found this minivan, and it seemed a great introduction to the Little People collection.The car comes with Linda the mom, Ashley the baby, and a stroller. Although my baby does not understand role play yet, she is happy to put the 'family' in and out of the car, and push it around the floor.The only two things that I did not like about this were: the bright PINK of the car. And the music is SO loud, with no volume control to tone it down. It plays two songs and giggles, says vroom vroom and beeps the horn. I might take the batteries out... :)"
4,No family values...???,"I am disappointed that there is not a ""daddy"" figure in this set. What's up with that?"
3,Cute toy!,"My one-year-old daughter likes this van, but it's not one of her favorites. She likes to play the music, but that's about it. And it's so loud! I guess it just wasn't her thing!"
4,Yet another great Little People toy!,"We love the Little People toys and have quite a few of them. My oldest is now five and she still enjoys playing with them. I love their durability and the way they stimulate so much imaginative play. This toy is no exception.The only negative thing I could say about the minivan is that the sounds it makes are way too loud. That's not the case with other Little People toys we have, so I don't understand why the volume is set so much higher on this one. Of course, that's MY complaint, not my kids'!!! I really do wish that toy manufacturers would pay more attention to the noise level of their toys. It's not good for kids' hearing or for parents' sanity.I'm off my soapbox now - I hope you enjoy this toy as much as my girls do."
3,BEEP BEEP!!,"It is a cute toy to play with for the kids....on the noise level-it is rather on the loud side-and sometimes annoying, especially when it says VA VA VAROOOOM BUM BUM BUM VAROOOM(in an annoying womans voice) overall it is a fun toy."
5,Awesome Oboe Concertos,"I have listened to many oboe concertos and these are some of the best to my ear. They are bubbly and expressive and soaring, accompanied by strong strings and horns.Von Dittersdorf was unfamiliar until recently I came across a recording of his Andantino which is just awesome, so in wanting to find more of this composer on oboe came across this.Lencses is brilliant with wonderful dynamics and sweet, clear sound. This is 75 minutes of oboe beauty. Relaxing, enchanting music."
1,Another book for the blind followers,"Yet again we find an MSIA bok being reviewed almost exclusively by MSIA members. For the real story behind this cult, research the book Life 102, What to do When Your Guru Sues You by Peter McWilliams. It's an eye opener."
4,gary chapman puts it in perspective,Another great book by Gary Chapman. He explains the different issues of separation and how they apply bibically. Most helpful to those with hope for reconciliation in marriage.
3,"Scripture packed, lacking clear actions to work on today","Of all the 'self help' how to get your lover back books I've read, this one was the least helpful. It definitly had a similar tone... it can work.. but turning my focus towards God does not feel like it will immediatly net the results I'm looking for. I'd like a better understanding of why she left, and what I can do to improve myself, in an effort to win her back."
2,Not enough reasoning about motivation,"This book is heavily oriented towards Christians and a Biblical motivation for marriage. I picked this up after reading Chapman's ""Five Love Languages,"" which was inspired by his faith but grounded in observation and study of real people.""Hope for the Separated"" does offer good advice on how to approach living apart, what to do with the time, how to approach reconcilliation, etc. Unfortunately, the only motivation given for reconcilliation, as opposed to divorce, is that the Bible says so. While this is enough for many, the approach of ""Five Love Languages"" led me to expect something more widely applicable.In sum, this book provides much of the ""How"" but not a whole lot of ""Why,"" unless a Biblical explaination is all the ""Why"" that you need."
5,Excellent Fairy Artwork that enraptures the senses,This is a beautiful book of some of the most enjoable art dealing with the enchanted realm. I found his artwork originally on greeting cards and was exstatic to see it collected in a wonderful book for coffee table viewing. enjoyable everday!@
