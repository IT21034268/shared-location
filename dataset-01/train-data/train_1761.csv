3,It's OK.,"The graphics are simply good, not great, the Rogue Squadron, I prefer Rogue Squadron, this seems like rehash of it, with the medal awarding system and many other aspects. I hope for the people over at Lucasarts to create a game of the original trilogy, with today's graphics it would be great."
4,CANT GET MY HUSBAND TO STOP PLAYING IT,"MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS GAME, GETS TOUGH AT POINTS, BUT I'D SAY IT'S A GREAT GAME, KIDS LOVE IT TOO!!!! RECOMMEND"
3,"OK Graphics, Goofy controls - 2 1/2 stars","...I can forgive the passable graphics and the Minor League sound but the controls are just terrible. They are really sluggish and you wind up playing ""Bumper Cars"" on the ground based missions. The space missions are ridiculous; you cannot move in all directions easily and your ship flies like a space-tanker.For example, I was flying a Naboo fighter and when I tried to pull a hard bank right the controls seem to respond: ""Duh, you want to turn right, uh, okey-dokey, let me see - that's this way.."" BANG! - I slam into a wall or the ground or get bounced off of one of the level's ""boundaries""....."
5,Titan more powerful then the gods,"Wow! A truly great biography of a man who did amazing things for the world.From a business side of things this book showed how a god of his times handles one of the largest companies of its times. The book also shows the many sides of Rockefeller being more than a businessman. It showed how no matter how hard he worked for Standard Oil he worked harder to give money away to those who truly needed it. He gave money for schools, and Universities. Also donated money to many individual people and various charities.The book is a great tool for understanding the start of the industrial revolution. Titan shows how one company can run an entire industry and have a virtual monopoly with no paper work just a hand shake. A truly great biography, about a truly great man."
4,Good book though exhaustive,"I enjoy this book about a man whose legend remains but details tend to be assumed by most of us rather than known.Like most biographies, especially by Chernow, the details are thick and deep and can be tedious. But it paints a full, rich picture of the man JDR as well as the time period that made him."
4,book,My husband really enjoyed reading this biography. He could hardly put the book down. Well written and very interesting!
4,A History Lesson,You could very well teach history as well as general business from this book. This book well documents Rockefeller's very humble beginnings. From wearing rags to the richest man in the universe. Rockefeller showed business cunning as well as an opportunistic streak in creating a huge business empire. The company created by Rockefeller was larger that the governments of some countries. It also covers the breakup of Standard Oil by the use of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. A very good coverage of the life of Rockefeller andhis accomplishments as well as his shortcomings. A must buy.
3,Omits very vital facts.,"Ron Chernow's masterful 700+ page biography 'Titan, the Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.,' has been a disappointment to me because he has completely omitted Rockefeller, Sr.'s involvement with members of the Fox family and the prominent Baptist minister the Rev. Robert MacArthur. Also, while mentioning the Rev. Edward Judson, I believe Chernow missed a beat in his failure to pick up on the symbolism to Rockefeller, Sr. represented by Judson. I speak so strongly because in my own book 'There's a Fox in Pinchot's Forest,' (Paupack PA 18451, FOSI Ltd., 1996), released April 1996, I recount for the first time the intertwining of the Fox family, MacArthur, Judson, Rockefeller, Sr., and the Baptist church."
5,"Conclusion, informative and a lesson in business history.","Knowing a little about JDR, I was fascinated about the things that I did not know. The book is very revealing of the inner workings of Rockefeller's mind and his rationale for his business decisions. His care of his family and avoidence to spoiling them convinces you that he truly thought blessed to have been given the chance to earn this fortune. It hurt him, I believe, to give all the money that he did and people still think of him as a robber baron. Even his brother was ungrateful. In all an excellent book and I recommend it to all who want to gain more knowledge of the past and one of the greatest business minds in history."
4,Chernow's anti-protestant bias,"A thorough and page-turning biography, but the author uses words that betray a preconceived haughty cultural bias when he refers to Baptists and even falls into describing Episcopalians and Presbyterians by cultural generalizations in the Holy Family chapter. JDR's faith may not have kept him from taking advantage of others in his weakness of driven ambition, but it steered him well. As the first major capitalist, he was blazing new ground. We should judge him by standards of his own era, not those from our more government-driven era. Chernow fairly quotes both friends and enemies. What great man doesn't have both?"
5,LOVE IT!,"Awesome writing, great use of prose, even the Forward was awesome. If youre into business, history and biographies, THIS IS YOUR BOOK."
3,A better than average biography of the oil king...,"Chernow offers insight and interesting tidbits throughout the first third to first half of the book. However, the book seems to bog down after describing Rockefeller's retirement, and doesn't fully recover. Given the consensus of most reviews, the book proved somewhat disappointing. After reading this biography the reader can draw some intriguing comparisons to the current titan of industry, Bill Gates."
4,Outstanding profile of a complex businessman,"If, like I, all you knew of John Rockefeller was that he was rich and really, really old, this book is for you. The author cronicles the rise of Rocky from abject proverty to total power over the US oil industry. On the way you learn how Rocky created the modern corporation as well as the good and bad sides to this complex individual. The book is a bit longish but for the most part Rocky's life is a real page turner."
1,Biased from the start,"Admittedly, many people already have an opinion of John D. Rockefeller, and many feel that he was greedy and evil. Just the same, the choice of language throughout the book is always negative to Rockefeller. He is never a good guy, even when attending church or donating money. He isn't upright, he's prudish. He isn't religious, he's sanctimonious. He doesn't form agreements, he forms cabals. Not knowing a lot about Rockefeller, I was hoping this would tell something of him. Not so. There are paragraphs saying that he only has religion and business as his activities, then suddenly we discover that he likes fast horses (and apparently has for years, since he owns several).This book reads much more like a rambling history of things that went on around Rockefeller than actual unbiased information about the man. A telling point might be that we never think of him as John, always as Mr. Rockefeller."
5,Ron Chernow is now my favorite author,"I just got this book and am only 64 pages into it, and I already find myself ordering every book Mr. Chernow has written. I've read biographies on Bill Gates, Lee Iacocca, Steve Jobs, Donald Trump, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Clinton, and many more, but this is by far the best-written biography I have every come across. This book is number 3 on my list of all time favorites right behind Atlas Shrugged and How to win friends and Influence people. I strongly recommend this book. It's been so interesting, that I find myself underlining passages on nearly every page. Mr. Chernow is a superb author, who has an excellent grasp of his subjects. This book delves into Rockefeller's character like no other book I've read, and paints an excellent portrait of one of the most enigmatic figures of our time. A must have for anyone exhibiting even the slightest interest in John D. Rockefeller."
5,this is not a bussines book,"This is a grate book, the author took us inside the life of JDR, relay putting you in his shoes. Nonetheless of his size, this book helps to understand this fascinating man. And a lot of American history"
5,Very Impressive,"It is Ron Chernow's writing style and skill that impressed me the most; next was the level of detail offered about John D. That said, John D.'s life in itself, as pesented by Ron, offers an invaluable lesson or two."
4,Interesting Chronology of An American Industrialist.,"Ron Chernow's Titan succinctly documents the life of John D. Rockefeller in its entirely. From his very humble beginnings in the Finger Lakes of Upstate New York to his retirement in Florida, Chernow successfully portrays this very controversial and infamous industrialist as a conflicted, pious, and shrude man.For those who are reading this book out of interest into economics or business tactics, you should probably try another biography as this book focuses on the life of Rockefeller and not the inner-workings of his business, Standard Oil. However, this book is interesting because it implies that certain aspects of ones life and certain characteristics that a person holds can adversely or positively affect their professional life.This is a very well written book. One that should be on the shelf of anyone who likes to study or read about people of power."
4,"Great book, so-so audiotape","The written book on which this audiotape is based is a distinguished piece of work. Chernow is clearly a master at the top of his form.However, one has to wonder about the choice of George Plimpton for the narrator of the audiobook. I found his accent totally distracting: ""a thuuud generation bapp-tist ministuh..."" Also, I found it strange that there were more photos of Plimpton in the cover artwork (2) than for Chernow, the author. The photo is the same one Plimpton has been using in Esquire for at least 15 years -- I'm sorry, he just doesn't look that young in real life anymore.A much better better choice of narrator would have been James Lurie, who narrated ""Buffet: the Making of an American Capitalist."" His tone does not get in the way of the story.If you are not distracted by Plimpton usurping Chernow's work, this is still a fabulous work of biography, every bit as good as Chernow's other works and perhaps better."
5,Insightful look into the life of one of America's great icon,"I thouroughly enjoyed this look at the life of Rockefeller. I felt the author treated the work with fairness, trying to show both sides of his complex personality. It is very well-written and gives a well-rounded view of both his personal life and his professional life. I came away with a lot more than I bargained for and was very pleased."
4,Very good way to put late 1800s into perspective,"This book puts the late 1800s into perspective. It's fascinating to read how businesses develop when little or no rules of engagement are in place. The most ruthless and devoid of emotion wins, which is good if you're part of the winning team. Not so good if you're trying to start a competing business or worked for the defeated party. If read carefully, you can see parallels with many business practices throughout the ages - including the present."
3,Ultimately unsatisfactory for this reader,"I'd like to echo the view that (a) it's written in a manner that's a pleasure to read, but (b) it does not explain why Standard Oil was a bigger and bigger success over the decades when Rockefeller was in charge, and (c) it gives far too many pages to Rockefeller's retirement years (and to the lives of his children). Before I read it, I had the vague idea that Rockefeller was the incarnation of greed; the book corrected me on that. But after I read it, I had no idea why Standard Oil was so sensationally successful, and this was what I really wanted to know. They had lower prices and higher profits. Why? You won't find the answer in this book. The only suggestion offered is that they had economies of scale in the matter of railroad transportation costs."
5,The Godfather of Mafia Journalism...,Jerry's great collection of real-life mob stories proves once again why he's the ultimate authority on the Mafia. Another good book by a good fella. Can't wait for the next one!
4,best filmmaking books for film students,"Right now, this book is a bit dated, but it used to be the best filmmaking book for film students. Trust me. I was one."
3,"lots of info,but title is a bit misleading","i read the other reveiws on this book and bought it. then returned it. it is packed full of all kinds of great information from industry experts, which is great, but i was looking for a book on filmaking for rebel independent film makers. It seems to be written for people with LOTS of money. which i don't have. in their defense the title does not say anything about independent, which is what i assumed. when i think of guerilla i think of rebels. this book is a bit out of my league."
1,Ejay is better,"This program is ok, but it doesn't have enough samples as much as eJay. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND that you take one of the EJAY CDs(techno, rave, dance, hip-hop, etc) or take EJAY SE.ThanksDanny Dyer"
2,Star Trekkin',"""Star Trek: Log One"" is basically just three episodes from the animated series put down on paper, with around 60 pages devoted to each (give or take). Though if you're like me and never watched the cartoon, then it's like a whole new set of adventures for the Enterprise and her crew (and you can imagine it with the real actors in your mind). The writing is pretty good, all things considered (aside from a number of typographical errors that should have been caught prior to publishing). The problem is that the quality of the episodes themselves is nothing to write home about. I can see them working in a cartoon but they're hardly worth the time and effort to sit and read through. Still, the author did an admirable job with so-so material, and if you're a fan of the original series then you'll probably get some enjoyment out of it in spite of its shortcomings.The episodes included herein are:""Beyond the Farthest Star""""Yesteryear""""One of Our Planets is Missing"""
2,way too small,"From Amazon, I usually buy shoes size 8.5 and sandals size 9, whatever the brand. Shoes size 9 are a bit big for me. This is why, after reading previous comments, I thought these shoes in size 9 would do. Big mistake. For these shoes you'd need to get a pair not one size bigger but a size and a half at least. I wonder, was it that difficult for the Tsubo brand people to check and follow the sizes at their manufacturer(s) back in China?"
4,A little small,"These run a tiny bit small, and I would have gotten a size 7.5 instead of 7 if I knew this. Otherwise they are nice shoes and very inexpensive."
3,Interesting but biased,This is an interesting book written not from recollections of Bill Decker but rather stories told many years later by various deputies. I would question is biographical value but still think it is interesting reading.
5,a great tale of adventure,"This is a fun, exciting and entertaining book--one of the best nonfiction stories I've read. Glenn Curtiss had an amazing life and overcame an astounding set of obstacles to make a major contribution to the modern airplane. Best of all, Shulman is able to bring the story alive--deepening and broadening our understanding of how the airplane came to be and how technologies evolve. You don't have to be an aviation buff or even a history lover to thoroughly enjoy this page-turning tale. I highly recommend it."
2,"More Shulman ""attack biography""","Seth Shulman deserves some credit for attempting to get overdue credit for Glen Curtiss's improvements to early forms of heavier-than-air invention. He is at the same time stingy in giving credit to Alexander Graham Bell's AEA organization, which provided immeasurable assitance to Curtiss. While the book is in places a good read, Shulman seems to have difficulty in judiciously using details, with the effect being his losing sight of the forest for the trees. In addition, when Shulman goes into ""attack mode"" (which he does in several of his books) he can be extraordinarily unfair to his subjects' rivals. Shulman is not as guilty in this book of the kind of misdirection, omission, and irresponsibility that he displayed in The Telephone Gambit, his attack on Bell, but readers should be very skeptical anytime that Shulman compares Curtiss and the Wright Brothers."
3,Much that is good and bad about this book,"I enjoyed reading about the efforts of Curtiss and colleagues. He was obviously an amazing inventor and did a great deal for the future of aviation. The constant bashing of the Wright Brothers was very tiresome and actually detracted from what was interesting reading about Curtiss. It took Shulman 90% of the book to give the Wright Brothers credit for what they had accomplished. Prior to that, I was waiting for Shulman to suggest that the Wright Brothers were not even present at Kitty Hawk."
1,Unwaiveringly BIASED and UNBALANCED,"Throughout this book Mr. Shulman denigrates the contribution of the Wright Brothers. His bias is so prevalent throughout the book that I found myself shaking my head as I read blatantly contradictory statements within 5 lines of each other. The author's opinions and accusations are either based on his limited research or his intentional omission of fact. If you're even considering buying this book, I would direct you to the author's own words following a completely inane paragraph of conjecture about Orville Wright............""Or perhaps not."" That about sums up this biased inaccurate ploy concealed in the history section."
3,History Misunderstood,"Seth Shulman has written an adequate book about Curtiss, who did contribute significantly to aviation development. It is readable and interesting but very weak in evaluating history. Shulman either misunderstands, or misrepresents, the relative merits of the Wright Bros. and Curtiss. Curtiss was a talented and committed enhancer of the airplane. Orville and Wilbur were geniuses who invented, out of whole cloth, wing warping (and, therefore, control), aviation propellers, the wind tunnel, and the airplane engine (that is, an engine with a high enough power to weight ratio). Give Curtiss his due but, on a scale of 10, the Wright Brothers are a 10 and Glenn is a 7 or 7.5. History rightly (or should I say Wrightly) recognizes the boys from Dayton."
3,Dissappointing,I expected this book to present a thorough examination of Glen Curtis's life and and his role in the development of early aviation. Instead the author provided a cursory and rather disjointed biography of Curtis concentrating on his patent dispute with the Wrights. It seems to be a somewhat rushed job content to make the point that Curtis's open style of innovation produced far more significant results than the Wrights' secretive and obstructionist course. Most of Curtis's accomplishments are relegated to an appendix in the back of the book almost as an afterthought. I would have preferred that these many critical contributions to the development of the airplane received a more expansive treatment in the narrative. This book is acceptable as an introduction to the life of Glen Curtis but is in no way the full tale.
2,The Smithsonian Strikes Again,"The subtitle; ""Glenn Hammond Curtiss and the Race to Invent the Airplane"", says much about the book. Curtiss had nothing to do with the invention of the airplane. Instead, the author vigorously argues in favor of Curtiss and the AEA (Aerial Experiment Association) as they blithely tried everything they could think of to steal, ignore, circumvent, or otherwise discredit the Wright's achievement. Their most odious act was the reconstruction of the Langley aerodrome, with the connivance of the Smithsonian, which has managed to so distort the historical record it is still fooling people today. This book carries their torch into the 21st Century. The AEA would be proud.For those of you reading these reviews, what the Wrights discovered/invented was not the Curtiss lawyer's narrow focus on wing-warping versus ailerons, but full three-axis control plus propulsion. Find an aircraft designer today who thinks those items are ""obsolete""."
3,Curtiss Still an Enigma,"With this book's sub-title of Glenn Hammond Curtiss and the Race to Invent the Airplane I had hoped that it would tell me more than it does about the complicated character of Curtiss. While Shulman's description and insights of the Wright/Curtiss legal battles are good, Shulman never seems to quite get his arms fully around Curtiss as a man."
2,Micro fiber panties,"Not at all what I thought I was getting. If I thought these were going to be thinner than a slip, feels thinner than pantyhose and overall uncomfortable and see through, I wouldn't have bought them. In white pants, you can't wear them. They weren't comfortable for me. Maybe for others."
2,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"I have to say, they are thinner, see-thru, and the waistband is like hemming tape. Odd. Reminds me why I don't usually buy clothing without seeing in person. Merchant was fine, though."
5,awesome vintage book,Book was shipped on time and was delivered in exactly the condition described. Much less expensive than other sellers.
4,enjoyable read and good illustration,"has 3 stories and all very good.. illustration is very nice. your learning-to-read child will enjoy it and if you are reading for your child, you can hear 'read it again' when you are done!"
2,A little babish,"I am 10 and a fan of the saddle club books and tv show, so I expected the cd to have songs that preteen girls would like. But this cd has songs with titles like It's a lovley day, I feel so alive, Amazing new norld, and A Pony is a girl's best friend.Here are some of the lyrics to It's a lovley day.It's a lovley dayIt's great to see you againIn every wayI'm so glad your my friendTrue friends forreverjust you and me.Now does that sound like a song that a 9 or 10 year old would like. NO! The only songs on this cd that I like are Undercover movers and shakers, L.I.F.E., and Stars tonight. Sophie Bennet sings I'm a Girl worse than I do. Buy this Cd, ONLY if your girl is 4-7 years old."
5,TI-nSpire Review,"Works great. Does everything I read it would do and more. Received next day from 3-day(+) shipping. It's magic.The only real downside I can see to this calculator is having to learn a new system. But that's half the fun, isn't it?"
4,Not for your Novice Math Student.,"I love that the TI Inspire comes with an endless number of abilities. It far surpasses the TI-84 and other previous models with it's abilities. It has made solving difficult equations as simple as pressing a few buttons and hitting enter. The only reason i do not give this product full marks is because, simple tasks can become difficult with this device. It takes a substantial amount of time to become acquainted with all the features, and it takes a certain amount of technical and math knowledge to operate properly."
5,Great Calculator,"Got it brand new for a super sweet deal off of here. $60 from Amazon vs. $200 at my local bookstore? Can't beat that! It came with the original software on it, so I updated it and the documentation is top notch. I think everyone just needs to update their CAS and learn how to use it. It's actually quite easy to use, especially with the update. This thing is gonna take me far in my engineering classes for college. However the only downside is that it's not compatible with switchable faceplates as the CAS is all one entire piece without any removable faceplate. I did do my research, I chose the CAS over the regular Nspire, and I am very, very happy with it."
2,Didn't work out too well,"I just returned this calculator. It does have a big screen which is good for reading graphs, and it does CAS. However, I didn't know from the picture that there are many VERY small buttons around the keyboard. I feel so annoying anytime I use it. I have to try to fit my finger among these small buttons in order to get to number buttons. To emphasize that my fingers are not big at all. I decided to pay an extra $30 to buy a refurbished TI-89. It looks like new and works perfectly. My advice is if you don't need CAS, pay a $20 more to get a new TI-83 or 84. If you do, buy a refurbished TI-89 from a good seller."
4,Handheld Solution Manual,"Purchased this item a few months ago. I'm currently taking calculus, and wanted a reference tool to solve more of the difficult problems that were not explained in the solutions manual. I didn't really listen to the negative reviews about the product on this site, and honestly I'm glad I didn't...this is a powerful tool. I guess my only complaint is I would like to import and export data from Excel into the Spreadsheet program on the calculator. I haven't figured out how to do this yet.Don't plan on bringing this thing on test day...it solves everything, including simplifying trig identities, graphs inequalities and piecewise functions.Another cool features is the SI unit capability. For example, you can save variables with units, like x can equal 1 Volt. Divide this by 1 Amp, and the calculator displays Ohms! Pretty powerful tool.Recommended buy for anyone needing the real answer to math problems."
4,Great Learning Computer,"I bought this after reading many reviews and actually had already purchased a TI-84 Silver Edition prior to this. Had I known about the Nspire coming out I would have waited the month till the release date.I own the TI-Nspire as well but bought the CAS version since it had more power to solve more problems and with the 1.4 OS release it just keeps getting better.The only bad thing I didn't like about this calculator was the fonts are not that big as there is very little difference between the medium and large size. And they should have included something to tilt the screen so that it could lay down and you still see the numbers on screen.I have never done well at math at all hardly ever, but thanks to the help of this calculator, I at least am going to pass for the first time with a B in math class."
5,Replaces the TI-89,"Simply put, this is an awesome calculator. I am a mechanical engineering student and have both a TI-89 and the Nspire CAS. The Nspire CAS is now the only calculator I use. With the nicer screen, I can write in very long, complex equations with ease. And for the price, this thing is a great deal. Buy it."
3,ok,I got this for a college Calc class and never ended up using it. I would take me longer to figure out how to do something then to study the calc and just use my TI-83. I have noticed that IT has since come out with a new version of this calc with a better keyboard because the one this has takes forever to find the letters.
5,great calculator,"Calculator works just fine. However, does not have a switch at back to swap out keyboards - it only has the older ClickPad keyboard."
5,My best calculator.,"I simply love this calculator.Before this I had the TI-92, but I prefer TI-Nspire, because the system is more intuitive, and easy to use."
4,Excellent calculator,"If you are looking for a basic graphing calculator this is definitely NOT the calculator for you. You would be much happier with a TI-84. With that said, this is an amazing tool for higher math use. The CAS software system is fantastic and there is a lot that this calculator will do. The only thing keeping me from a 5 star rating is the dearth of documentation that comes with the calculator."
1,Very un user friendly,"Very un user friendly. This calculator makes even the basic tasks seem hard sometimes because of the way that you have input some data.This calculator has great potential, and can do great things as long as you have a good thick manual telling you how to set up and program your calculator. And how to read and convert the settings.My calculator also decides to think for you and change your output from decimal to fractions on a regular basis. Annoying and time consuming to reset the program especially if this happens in the middle of a problem.I would not recommend this calculator to anyone until Texas instruments makes it more user friendly.But if your school is part of the TI Mafia (like mine is) and demands this calculator get a good manual (not a TI manual) and start practicing as soon as possible so that you are familiar with it's quirks.Some schools are also offering classes on how to use this calculator, TAKE THEM.It will help you out immensely."
1,Is this some kind of joke?,"I bought the calculator and thought the software license was included in the price. It turns out that I paid for the license, but there is a disconnect between Amazon and Texas Instruments and no amount of phone calls can resolve the issue. The calculator is nice, the software interesting, but I would not recommend buying this system from Amazon."
1,Furious,This is the worse product I ever bought! My son used it for one day and it stopped working. We changed the batteries and it did not fix the problem.
2,box should have been smaller,"Sebesky should have made a straight ahead big band record. Unfortunately, he indulges in the same syrupy string arrangements that marred so many CTI releases. The remainder is mediocre funk.I'm happy CTI is re-releasing much of their catalog, but this is too much fluff. There's some obligatory Coltrane-style blowing, but these musicians are better heard elsewhere."
1,Disappointing compared to Hall's other work...,"This book gives us a brief picture of life in the South Pacific during WWII. But, it's not so much about the war as it is about the inevitability of change. The author tries to present the so-called tragedies of industrialization injected into an idyllic environment of stagnant (though supposedly blissful) island culture. Although I did enjoy this book, especially the can-do attitude of the American Army and Navy engineers, the obvious dichotomy between the American sense of life and the anti-technology philosophy that plagues the main character is disappointing."
2,Dont waste your money! by Corey (see more abaute me),Dont waste your money on this really bad blade!What is so cool abaute a tiger claw attack.This blade always gos in the pits and has a really thin attack ring and I mean thin.Do not buy this blade!
4,11 Year old Intermediate beyblader,"driger f is a pretty good beyblade it is a good attacker and it is good at endurance.I've beaten a dragoon fighter,dragoon storm and a metal draicel with it.But it could ce better if you used galzzly's attack ring,driger f's blade base and galeon attacker's weight ring.then it will be pretty hard to beat."
3,MUST READ!!!,"I am so disapointed in this blade. I was thinking it was going to be awesome. The attack ring isn't to bad, it's just that the base is totally wrong. The clutch system doesn't do anything. Get a different blade."
5,Blades,Hi I am the leader of the Black tigers Team located in Triagle VA I think this blade is ok I broke my friends attack ring with 1 shot I have alot o blades this is my fave. trygle 1 of the best real good I wish all you other bladers good luck and if you ever come by ask for Paco or Raven or J I will rule beyblades 1 day hope you can at least stay 1 min in the ring with me C ya.
2,Do not bother,"This blade [is bad]! Trust me, if you want a powerful beyblade stick with Drigger V-1. Believe me when I used it I broke two of my launchers! I am the leader of my own Blade Sharks team and the bottom line do not get this blade! I suggest Drigger V-1!"
5,I am that is,No offense to ne1 who thinks this blade is the best but i destroyed it. i used it's close relitavie drigar v combined with a few other drigers to create ultimate drigar. I started off with what i thought was a normal blade but in my first match against 4 other blades i found that no one stood a chance against me. I could enter in tournaments and win but i prefer not to. in my first battle against master dragoon dracil fortres ultimate sazio and driger f i destroyed every one with crusing power. for some reason ultimate drigar went for driger f first and snapped the attack ring into little pieces next ultimate sazio was blasted out of the arena next it went for master dragoon and let's just say death from above and finaly it came to dracil fortres and totaly annialited it. so as u can see u should only use this blade for parts. (I reccomend the base)Ray of The Thandaga's
5,ummm....... yeah,"P>... it only spins for 30-40 seconds. It is really fast, but does that really matter.Keep the attack ring 3 attack and 3 defense and [get rid of] the weight ring and base for master dranzer weight ring and base. (spins for 2.5 minutes to 3.If you want it to be a good attacker use dragoon storm, fighter, or gazzly base so it could attack the opponents base or weight ring"
5,Driger F is the Best!,This was my 2nd blade. I think it is the best Blade.It goes crazy in the stadium. It does weare out after awhile though. At least mine did. I gave it a 3 in educational because it teaches you how a spring works. I hope you find this review useful.
2,this blade is bad,i got this blade thinking that it would be good because of the auto clutch but it is not all my other blades can beat it accept dragoon storm i do not reccommend this blade if you want to buy a good blade go for driger-s even though this one has higher stats than driger-s it knocks its self out in about 10 seconds
5,Driger . . . . . . . Lightning fang attack !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hi im Vish . i am an expert blader . My blade is DRIGER FANG ( driger f) . If you coooking oil on the tip it will have 4 star endurance 3 defence and 4 attack .

3,Not Perfect,The strap is too stretchy. I was trying to get the oil filter off of a 6.6 liter International Truck diesel (huge filter) and was worried that the strap was going to break due to the stretching. Here's the wrench you need for those big heavy duty filters. The strap doesn't stretch at all.KD Tools (KDT3529) Heavy Duty Oil FIlter Strap WrenchFor light duty car filters that aren't too tight this Lisle would be OK.
5,Another Winner,"Here is another winner in board books by Margaret Miller.Beautiful photos of children doing different activities fillthe pages of this delightful work.Your child can share withothers are they are running, riding, or digging, to name a few.Great teaching tool of activities done everyday."
3,"Karaoke & MP3's, it's only plus","The quality and features of the DVD player are not it's best features. I bought it for the MP3 and karaoke feature with the added bonus of the dvd player in the same unit. MP3 playing is decent but doesn't have a random mode. The dual karaoke is decent but not true karaoke (but what do you expect for the price!!). It appears that one can only do karaoke for CD's though. As for the DVD player, subtitles default to on for every movie. A bit annoying especially if using a universal remote where it doesn't have capabilities of turning it off. The remote is very slow for everything (FF, Play, menu, subtitles). The online games of tetris is thus hampered with the slow response of the remote. Overall, definately a good player for the money if placed in a bedroom and not the main entertainment room where a better quality DVD player is recommended."
4,Dont loose the remote!!!,"Great system, great for parties, singing, watching the new DVD's. But dont loose the remote. You cant get a hold of the GPX company to get a new one. Anyone out there have an extra??? Get with me!!! Universal remotes dont work, and without one, you cant go to the next show, use the menu options or anything like that. Other than that, its a great system!!!!"
1,GPX has poor customer service,"This player worked fine for about a year then it wouldnt reconize a DVD when it was put in, I called the company and they told me they didnt repair their players but would sell me another one. My Advice is stay away from GPX."
3,good for the price,Good dvd not great. the subtitiles always need to be shut off at when starting movie.
2,Too predictable,"Although I'm very interested in Eritrea, I found this book a duty rather than a pleasure. That's probably just a personal preference. I found the author a bit predictable and didn't find myself caring enough about her, despite her situation."
3,PAC-SWI PS Description,"The product I received when I purchased this item looked very different from the picture of the item. The item I received required one wire hooked up and 2 resistors wrigged up to another connection. Once installed the real issue arose. In my case I mainly wanted to be able to do volume up and down from the steering wheel. I expected to be able to use all functions which is not the case. At first all volume, source, and seek buttons worked. After a week the sek buttons started glitching and after a day or two stopped all together. Now the only consistent working button is volume down, most of the time volume up works, but it still glitches intermitently. My seek down still works though seek up is completely responsive."
4,Works pretty good,"Bought this for my 04 Tahoe. The package says it doesn't work with my radio (Pioneer avh-p4000dvd) but it works just fine. I don't know how I lived without steering wheel controls before my Tahoe, and I'm glad I was able to find a deck and kit that allowed me to keep them.Install was way easy, just connect the jack to the rear of the radio, and vampire tap two other wires.Only problem is that sometimes (three times in two months) the buttons will randomly stop working or work opposite of how they are supposed to. I haven't found any particular cause of this (maybe the box gets hot?), but it fixes itself after a while or after turning off the truck.Otherwise, good to go. Buy here since these are about $100 in store."
3,Works.. but slow,"It enables factory steering wheel buttons to be used with the aftermarket stereo. It works well.. there is a definite delay between when the switch is pressed and when you see the response from the head unit. Ater 1 year of use, one of the steering wheel switch do not have any response.. not sure if it is PAC unit's complaint.."
1,Useless,"I purchased this along with a new head unit for my car. Upon installation it worked intermittently for a short time, say a day or two, but then suddenly stopped responding to button pushes.I contacted tech support and they walked through some troubleshooting but ultimately decided that I had a defective unit and we set up a replacement.Upon receiving and installing the replacement the exact same thing happened- the device would work intermittently for a day or two before completely failing to respond.I've installed just about every piece of car audio equipment I've ever owned, so I'm not a novice but I took it to a local installation, just in case the problem was me.Want to know something funny? They refused to install it. They claimed they have had nothing but problems with the device and have completely stopped installing them as a result.This is essentially a ~$45 paperweight, and an ugly one at that. I highly recommend against purchasing it."
2,Works when it feels like it,"This product is supposed to restore full functionality of steering wheel controls. How ever I noticed that it doesn't always work. Usually the next song button stops working or it magically changes into previous song for either of the buttons. The volume button always works that isn't an issue. The mode button also does crazy stuff where it sometimes turns the device on or off, other times it may just mute it while it is still on, other times it changes the function from USB to Radio etc... Strange! Not to pleased with this product when it isn't working (40% of the time) but happy when it is (60% of the time)"
4,Some issues between Ford Excursion and Pioneer AVIC-F900BT,"I purchased this knowing that the Pioneer head unit does not support Preset Up/Down, but was desperate to get my Volume Up/Down buttons working.Installation was very straight-forward, attaching 3 wires to the aftermarket harness I used when I installed the Pioneer. I didn't have to cut into any existing wires in the vehicle.Programming was easy - push the steering wheel button, then push the button on the PAC unit for each of 9 functions. The LED on the PAC flashes to confirm that a button has been pressed.However...I was only able to map Volume Up correctly. Volume Down mutes the Pioneer, Next changes the audio source (FM/AM/Disk/Sat Radio), and Mode changes the band (FM1/FM2/FM3 or Sirius 1/Sirius 2/Sirius 3).Not ideal, but at least each button does something, and does it consistently in my vehicle. It is much, much better than having buttons at your fingertips that do nothing."
2,need some work,"hardly ever works, not realiable. When it works, the button I press is not what executes."
3,Lots to consider here,I think this will be a good discussion video. I'm not sure just how to frame this bible study as there may be some controversial subject matter included in this video. That is going to make for good discussion sessions if I can frame the subject matter acccordingly.
2,Disappointed,My husband and I are sailors and I had hoped that sailing would be integrated into the story. I thought the sailing bits were very incidental to the story and not very plausible. By the end of the book I didn't really care much about the story resolution.
1,No mat,"I ordered this used, from this Amazon link/description, and received no mat. If the items included differs from new to used, it should be indicated somewhere in the listing. Do not buy this used and expect a mat."
5,Great for Preschoolers!,"HelloWe have been battling our DDR mat with our 3 year old and this is a great solution. It has a nice choice of games, one game has no rules but to jump on any color you choose (my daughters favorite game and she is almost 4). There is a hopscotch game, but my daughter thinks it is hilarious to watch her dive in the water when the wrong answer is chosen."
4,Very Active and Fun!!,Great game for the preschool set. My son and nephews (3 - 5) all love jumping around with this game. Little do they know they are learning their letters and shapes at the same time. The games are very simple and easy for the kids to understand. As they get better the games get harder so it remains a challenge. The games also work with the PS controller but the jumping mat is really what keeps them interested. Additional games are avilable so it's worth the cost of the mat.
2,quantity wrong,"Beware. The item listing for this and some of the other Wausau card stock paper says it's 500 count, but if you read the description or check the item number with other vendors, this item is in fact only 250 sheets of paper instead of 500. Hopefully, it was just a typo on the part of Shoplet and they will rectify it soon."
5,For my husband.,He hasn't opened it yet. It is for Christmas Day for him to open and enjoy.I'm sure he will love it he is a motorcycle guy.
5,Unified-In the Name of Love,"Not to disredit the other reviewers, but I think most have missed the purpose of this project-""A portion of the proceeds of this album goes to World Vision to help fight the AIDS crisis in Africa""-as stated on the CD jacket. To this reviewer it means even more. It is a unifying effort bringing ""popular secular"" together with ""Contemporary Christian"" music. As some younger listeners might not know, U2 was embraced by Christian young people all over the world. But-until this project-the two went their separate ways. It stands as a testament to CCM artists that they would honor Bono, The Edge and the rest of U2 by producing this very complimentary effort. As far as each song is concerned, I tend to agree with most of what has been written positively about them. Each artist's own style is heard-as it should be-through the individual tracks. Christian unity for a good cause. THAT'S what it's all about-in the name of Jesus' love."
1,Keep Looking,"This book, although it covers a broad range of topics, does not adequately cover any of them. I teach sewing and bough this book thinking it might be good to use as a text, and was very disappointed. The pictures are hard to see, the directions vague. If I did not know what they meant already, I never would have been able to figure it out from this text. I do not recommend this book to any seamstress at any level."
2,not for beginners,terminology not for the inexperienced. directions vague. i'll be returning it.i much prefer the readers digest complete guide to sewing.
4,Excellent for those times when your brain just goes blank.,"I love this book, it is great for those times when I am sewing and just can't remember how to do something that is called for. As a sewing site guide on bellaonline.com it has come in handy to answer questions for those long forgotten things, like handstitching a buttonhole. Tho I do wish that there were a few more illustrations when describing how to accomplish something, I do recommend this book to any sewer from beginner to experienced."
3,Moderately useful but not complete,"This small volume is handy for quick reference when you just can't remember that hand stitch but it's not as comprehensive as other books. Still, it's good to keep in the car or suitcase for emergencies."
4,Good Tip Book,I thought this to be a very good tip/reference book for those just beginning to sew. I am past that stage so I am keeping this for when I teach someone else.
2,too short,not at all what i thought. i thought the book would be bigger and have more info in it . it does have some helpful hints but not enough to be put in a book
2,Not as Good as Graham's Other Books,This book is a bit of a disappointment to me. The story is not convincing-- too much of a formula and the characters shallow and contrived.
5,Quite possibly one of the best shoujo manga series ever,"It's so refreshing to read a shoujo series that isn't all ""I love you"" and ""I love you, too"". Rather than being a helpless, idiotic Mary Sue, the heroine, Yuri, is one that can actually defend herself most of the time. This manga is based on real people, events, and places from ancient history, making it a fascinating read. Shinohara evidently did a great job with her research! Equally touching is the main relationship between Yuri and Prince Kail of the Hittites. They acknowledge their love for one another, but the series is not centered around their relationship. Yuri's relationships with the other characters in the story are equally appealing.This is a manga filled with action, history, fantasy, romance, and even a bit of humor. It's sure to satisfy any fan of shoujo manga or of Chie Shinohara's other works."
4,Lost gem from the late 70s,"As evidenced by her wonderful work as the designated female background singer on Meat Loaf's landmark ""Bat Out of Hell,"" singer-actress Ellen Foley proved that she had a way with theatrical, melodramatic rock. This is late 70s chick-rock at its best. She delivers a great performance on the Graham Parker cover ""Thunder and Rain."" She has just the right touch on ""Night Out,"" the title track. And on ""We Belong to the Night,"" which got some airplay at the time of its release, she delivers the bombastic range appropriate for someone who formerly backed up Mr. Loaf.So what that it's overly dramatic and kitschy. Like all good rock and roll, it's fun, it's sexy, and you can sing along to it. Ms. Foley put out too few records and acted in too few roles."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SERIOUS COLLECTION,"While we all came to know her as ""the girl"" in Meat Loaf's ""Paradise by the Dashboard Light""; thank the ""suits"" who saw fit to rerelease this on CD. YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS CD. MS. FOLEY IS A TRUE ARTIST OUT FRONT ON HER OWN. HER VOCALS ARE OUTSTANDING, AND, COMBINED WITH THE MUSIC- THIS IS SIMPLY A MUST-HAVE CD!! I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. ORDER IT NOW!!"
5,Stunning recording,"It's a shame that it is so hard to get at a reasonable price. Google World Music Library and follow the first link to get to their officical web-site, where you can buy the CD for about 16 pounds. I lucked out on eBay and have been stunned by the quality of the recording, not to mention the music itself."
4,Great level! Guaranteed vials!,"Very strong, sturdy level. I have had mine for 2+ yrs and have put it through the nine levels of remodelers Hades.It is a little strange at first to get used to the bevels on the edges, as formerly stated in another review, but if I need a really precise line I use a straight edge anyway.Vials are guaranteed forever so if one goes katywompus on ya just send it to the manufacturer.The only thing I don't like is that they are made in China. That's why it is a 4 instead of a 5 star level."
5,Get this Tool,"The Empire e70.48 is the best level I have every owned. I used to be a Stabila user by I have seen the ""True-Blue"" and converted. There is hope for all you other German level users. Along with being easier to use these cost alot less if you buy them from Amazon.com.Thanks Empire for making me see ""Blue"" , True Blue!!!"
2,Buy a Stabila,"Unless I am buying a top of the line level, I like to test it first by doing the 180 degree test. Basically, an accurate level should show the bubble in the exact same place when turned 180 degrees.So I bought one of these levels about 2 years ago at a big box store when one ""disappeared"" from one of my work vans. It tested fine. About a year later, it was about 1/4"" off on 4' (1"" off on 16' !! NOT acceptable). I called Empire and they sent me a new one no questions asked. This one tested fine. A year later, and it's about 1/8"" off on 4'. Again, not acceptable. They are sending me another one. This one will see limited use as a backup to the many Stabilas my company owns.Two stars for great warranty on a shoddy product.UPDATE: Even w. light use, the third one is now out of whack. If you are a pro, stick w. Stabila."
2,No better than a level at half the price,"Bought this to upgrade from an 8 yr old level that was starting to give suspect readings. Tested the e70 on a flat level surface and did not get consistent readings when flipping it over and end to end. Supposed to give stated accuracy (less than 1/32"" for 4 feet) in all directions. Sounded good, but didn't live up to expectations."
2,too expensive,I was wrong thinking buy a expensive good level for years...After 10 month one of label show a 0.5 inch wrong! Thats suck...Better buy the cheap one and be sure you loose less money after year of use!
3,Nu Metal ~ Sam Kinison?,"Nu Metal is far from my favorite Genre of music but if you like(d) Sam Kinison then you will probably like this CD. The lead singer yells like Kinison and the cursing is all Sam on this CD. Who knows maybe he isn't dead afterall - hence song #3 ""I Can't Die""... Happy April Fool's Day"
4,good,It came in great timing but the center of the CD case was all broken so the CD was sliding around but other then that all good.
2,"Another day, another contrived nu-metal disc","This band are another band who have an subscription to the `how to be a nu-metal band' handbook. Everything about this band screams unoriginality and clichés; the name, the image, the `offensive' album cover, the attitudes and, of course the music. `Pushing me' sounds like Coal Chamber, the title track has the obligatory Tool style vocals in the chorus, `stick it up' is a Soulfly clone, and there's no shortage of Deftones/ Korn riffs and Slipknot style screaming. The only track that really stands out among all this mediocrity is `Fallout', but that isn't enough to save this album.This band are as contrived and homogeneous as a pop band and are basically a boy-band but aimed at the `edgy' rock audience, who think that this sort of thing is alternative. Slaves on Dope? Slaves to a record company more like!"
5,Happy Fish!,I love this product. It is sleak and neat by design and can be purchased for the naturally planted aquarium or with incandscent bulb. Filter media is easiy swapped out. I like that there is no filter hanging about - in or out of the tank distracting the veiwer from the beauty of your fish and tank decore - or room decore for that matter.
1,Worked once,"I was very disappointed with this product. It work once and I tried it on different computers and nothing. It only cost $20.00 but I still feel I got ripped off. But what can I do?DerrickLos Alamos, NM"
1,MIXMAN IS BAD! BEWARE READ BEFORE YOU BUY,"Extremely poor support. They will NOT return emails. Every file you get from them has to connect to the internet to validate the serial number when you install the them! and it crashes for no reason! I had a few viruses and had to redo my computer a few times... and they locked my serial number out. So for $50 dollars I got a program that I can't use. I sent three emails...NONE of them were answered. Remember, you heard it here first! BEWARE!! This company stinks and only cares about a sale!"
2,huh..... well......... not a bad thing to play around,"huh..... well......... it's not a bad thing to play aroundit's a really cool thing for non musical person but....... to me....... i bought it .... but it's totally a toythe sound quality, not yet CD quality,the control not accuarte and not stable......... that is to me as a persion who start producing some music for 1 year, and using some real gears..... this thing fun to play, just for fun!yet is you are professional DJ, go for..., not this unstable baby.www.mp3.com/dxl"
5,TONS of shade,"I use this sunshade with my coffee brown Maclaren Twin Triumph stroller, and I love it. The color is almost exactly the same, and is close enough that you can't tell it's different unless you're staring at it. The shade goes on and comes off easily, and stores in a small bag that fits easily in the basket under the stroller. It provides a TON of shade and keeps the kids cool. We also love the venting on the side that allows a little extra wind the blow through when there's a breeze, and gives the kids a way to see out the side of the stroller when we're walking. GREAT buy!"
3,Not worth the price,It does help block more sun but it's not worth $40. It's just a piece of fabric with a flexible rod and some fabric ties. It also appears to block airflow for the babies because they seemed more sweaty after I put this on. I'm sending it back.
3,"Good shade, clumsy attachment","First and foremost, this shade provides good sun protection. I also like the added benefit of privacy. I don't feel like people are staring at my twins. The only drawback are the attachment strings. They aren't great and there should be one more in the middle of the top to evenly secure it or it starts to slip. My MIL offered to sew more straps on it but in the meantime we are safety pinning it to the stroller shade. I take the shade off between uses when I fold my stroller up so I find it a little clumsy to put on and take off again but according to the directions, you can leave it on too. Overall a good sunshade for sun protection. Would be great with a couple tweaks."
3,Better than nothing,"We live in Arizona so sun protection is a big issue and I did not want to have to apply sunscreen to my twins every morning to go for our walk. The shades that come with strollers are never adequate to keep them in the shade. The sunshade helps but in order to keep them shaded sometimes I have to untie the back ties and let the shade tip over the fron and rest on the front crossbars, which completely obstructs the boys' view. Again, it's better than nothing and nice to have something that works on a side by side double stroller. It also does blow backward on windy days but unless you live in a particularly windy place you'll probably be ok most days."
3,Address Corrector: a somewhat usefull program,"Address Corrector is a program that automatically corrects addresses in a data file. It works well, but the main shortcoming is that it is limited to correct only 2500 addresses. More corrections must be paid for by contacting the publisher, Infosource."
2,"Messy Book, by fermed","What could have (should have) been the intriguing history of the Absolut bottle and its contents of Swedish vodka, turns out to be a disorganized compendium that includes so much dull extraneous material that at least this reader was forced to abandon the book several times, only to return to it out of a sense of duty. Not, certainly, out of love for good writing.The material in this book, carefully trimmed, might have made a single excellent article of the old New Yorker variety. Instead the book contains a forest of irrelevancies into which the reader is dumped, promptly to get lost. When, at last, the ""biography of a bottle"" is addressed, it comes in fits and starts that may be entertaining to an adman, but not to the general reader.Not recommended for those with a low threshold for boredom. Are there no longer book editors plying their trade?"
1,Tells only the good stuff ...,Biased and therefore not worth spending the time to read. Could you claim to really know anything if much of it was hidden? Indeed if it's vital parts were hidden?
5,Absolut: Biography of a Bottle,"I loved getting this book, as it completed my 3 book series on this marketing campaign. For some reason, though I don't drink, these books were insightful and had the artistic element that I have a passion for."
4,For the collector,"If you collect absolut vodka items, you must have this book. If you don't ... you'll never understand why it was even published."
4,Music for relaxation and enjoyment,This is one of my very favorite CDs. The music combines natural sounds of a particular place in the Caribbean with an original composition.It never fails to uplift and console or accompany.
2,Only Introductory,"When Freedman sticks to the text of the Hebrew Bible, he makes a good case for his theme. Some of his thoughts are forced and speculative. As much as he would like to see himself free of bias, objectivity remains elusive when he cites opinions and not primary sources, such as the text itself. The book is only 100 pages and requires further elaboration. For a better introductory work, I recommend Steven Dempster, ""An Extraordinary Fact: Torah and Temple and the Contours of the Hebrew Canon,"" Tyndale Bulletin 48.1 (1997), pp 23-56, and 48.2, pp 191-218."
3,Lady Jane Grey: Victim of the Power and Glory,"I have not yet read this book but does it really state that Lady Jane Grey was put to death by hanging? She was not hanged. She was beheaded by the axe, a ""luxury"" reserved for the well-born."
3,"Not bad, but not fact.","This isn't a bad book, but it must be emphasized that it is a novel. Fiction. Not the result of research done by a historian. It should not be read by anyone looking for the ""true"" story of Lady Jane Grey, any more than one should read ""Gone With The Wind"" to learn the history of the Battle of Atlanta. The author should not have used the words ""The Story of"" in the title (maybe ""A"" instead of ""The"") and Amazon should not list the book under biographies."
2,"Death by hanging? sorry, I dont buy it","I am a direct desendant of the House of Suffolk through Jane's cousin Lord Ferdinand Strange and I recommend checking certain incontravertible facts before purchasing this: First, Jane ruled England for 9 days, not 7. Secondly, Jane was executed by beheading (as aforementioned a death reserved for the well-born) and Third, Jane's cousin Mary was far more popular than Protestant Jane. Its nice to see someone would have enough interest in this fascinating personality to write a book but some background checking would be advisable."
3,"good read, but none-the-less there are some problems","I enjoyed the book, yet I rank it up there with the book Elizabeth. Both do mention real people and some of the books actually have some fact to them. Yet, I find that it was more fiction than true. However, I still would recommend reading this book over some other fiction story. Don't get me wrong I own this book and Elizabeth, and enjoyed both, but I refuse to take it as non-fiction in that I know better."
1,Coronation of Glory: The Story of Lady Jane Grey,"I would not recommend this book to any serious readers or adult readers. Rather, this is a romantic novel for young adults. You would learn nothing from this book about the historical or political background in which Lady Jane was crowned and beheaded. I just wonder what happend to ""the R-word""...research! The author's one-dimensional analysis of main charaters --- either bad or good, was too simplistic for adult readers and utterly unsatisfactory. I have read some other Tudor novels such as The Other Boylen Girl, The Queen's Bastard, and Elizabeth, but I would have to say this is by far the worst one. If you have to read, just borrow it from a local library. Not worth buying."
1,DO NOT buy this book if you want FACT!,"If it's fiction you want then this book is for you! However, for those of you seeking fact I suggest looking for ""The Nine Days Queen"" by Mary Luke who actually did some research. Lady Jane Grey was queen for 9 days and was beheaded. And don't watch the movie for facts...it's a great movie. I own it and love it but it's not entirely true either. DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU'RE TOLD! LOOK IT UP!"
2,Bland,"This is your run-of-the-mill southern album. One thing it was fortunately missing was a slew of guest appearances and skits galore. There are a few tracks that stand out amongst the rest but even these are tracks that you could live without hearing. It sounded like K-Rab (supposed father of Snap Music) and this group wanted to cash in on what's hot at the moment. And that's subpar beats made by a Casio. If you're interested in buying this, don't have high expectations.Tracks Worth Mentioning:Do The Poole PalaceHit Me On My MetroSteady Choppin'"
4,The practical Risk Management techniques,"This book is really made to get a practical view of:What the Risk Management isHow to collect risksHow to handle risksHow to make sure the risks are under controlAs this book is based onto the PMI best practices (coming from the PMBOK), it is a best in class learning book for Project Managers: Real Project Managers."
5,Real Risk Management for Real Life Projects,"I found Ms. Mulcahy's book on risk management to be very informative and above all practical. This is not credenza material designed to take up space, look pretty and collect dust. It is a tool to be used as a reference, and source of ideas throughout the life of a project. I use it and have recommended it highly to my fellow project managers. Both beginners and seasoned professionals will find useful information they can apply to make their projects more successful, along with increasing their personal knowledge of the importance and application of risk management."
2,I expected a more engaging read,"As is the case with many of Rita's works, they tend to border on pedantic and dry written material that doesn't truly engage the reader in the project. After a somewhat tedious read of the work, I felt it lacked much of the insight that I would have expected from something for which I paid the full price. Though that price has reduced greatly from $69, for a 336 page book, I'm not of the belief that the information contained is all that groundbreaking, nor worth $43 as of this writing.If you're reading this because of a PMP recertification requirement under Category 2-SDL, it fulfills that requirement in a rather dry and disengaged manner. Cheap route to 15 PDU's? Yes, though there are many that are even cheaper. Meaningful and worthwhile? I felt it lacking, and laborious."
5,Inspiring!,Such a cheerful book. You can't help but share Chip's emotions with this wonderful artwork and feeling-filled story. Two thumbs up. VERY well written.
4,good story,"Tame story now, but I enjoyed the English dialog. I would recomend to anyone who enjoys books about small boats, and WWII."
5,Electrophying,"I saw dreamtrybe during Pheonix Phyre 2000 and all I can say is they had this crone a jumpin! Fantastic rythms, electrophying harmonies and wonderfull spirit! This is an album that will be worn out in the first two weeks I have it. Keep writing and playing guys! Blessed Be!"
4,Fragile World,"This is a textbook and it reads like one. However, it is full of well documented (and often frightening) information. I recommend reading only one chapter a week to prevent being overwhelmed."
4,Doomed,A very well researched work. It should be read by the leadership on the right and left. To say we are doomed is an understatement.
1,Quite disappointing,A lot of history of calculations for possible saturation point but not always the sustainable number. Has no actual conclusion or even a guess. The estimate of one billion to one trillion is not very useful.
2,Too technical and theoretical.,"This is a highly technical and theoretical treatment with a heavy emphasis on quantitative analysis rather than social science or policy. While it may be a useful work for scholars in the field, it is neither accessible or helpful for a lay reader. I found it very uninteresting and disappointing. There are many better books out there on overpopulation, demographics and planned parenthood policies."
1,Too small for Raytek MT6!,"Although Amazon claims that this case is for the Raytek MT6 it does not fit. The flap will not close with a MT6 in the case. Plus, Amazon indicates it is a ""Raytek"" brand case, which is doubtful. Notice that it does not say ""Raytek"" on the package, and the model MTAPK does not show up as a Raytek accessory on their web site.To top it off, when you buy a Raytek MT6 thermometer it already COMES with a case (at least the last three we bought did).So don't waste your money on this MTAPK case."
3,Pouch Not Genuine Raytec,"Amazon advertises this item as ""Raytec MTAPK Pouch and Carrying Kit for MT Temperature Gun Series."" Those ordering might assume that it is manufactured by or for Raytec with item number MTAPK, but nothing on the packaging identifies it as being manufactured by or for Raytec - no manufacturers name or address, no model number MTAPK, nor other identifying information, other than the familiar ""Made in China.""Though the pouch I received does work with my MT4 temperature gun, and the material appears to be durable, it does not fully contain the top of the gun and it would be possible for a pencil, pen, or other narrow pointed object to damage the temperature sensor lens."
2,Not much use but too cheap to return,Too tight and really no better than the one provided with the unit. Wasted my money by not realizing the gauge came with a cover.
2,Very basic,This book is very basic. I will provide a good introduction to one who has very little knowledge of astrology.
1,No worth,"Just a compilation of known - like what zodiac signs, planets and aspects are. If you want to buy - may be buy better blank paper."
3,Missing piece to put it together,The neck of the stand was missing. So it could not be put together. My husband had to rig it so that it would work.
5,Great stand,Well built and stable. I ordered a triple holder by OnStage but it wouldn't hold 3 acoustic guitars.
5,Wonderful!,It went together very quickly and with no problems inspite of not receiving directions. No tools needed. Just what we wanted!
3,ok but the regular whoozit is better,"My 4-month-old loved the baby whoozit, so i figured adding sound and lights would be a slam dunk. Unfortunately, not so, the lights are so dim and the music is super caned sounding. And, perhaps because of the music piece it is sort of over-stuffed, not as plush feeling as the baby whoozit. Also, it is missing a lot of the textures the baby whoozit has which my baby loves -- corduroy, crinkle, satin, etc.Compared to a lot of the other baby toys out there this one is great, but compared to all the the Manhattan toy stuff its just ok. Save your money and buy the baby whoozit or the skwish."
3,Not what I bargained for,"I ordered this product in the hope of having another sound/light entertainer for my daughter. Although it does have light, it is very small and not very noticeable. Object is very colorful and made of many textures, just not what I was looking for."
3,Not as fun as it looks,I bought this for my 3 mth old but she doesn't like it. It doesn't have any sound to it unless you pull the cord and the extensions don't really do anything so it's pretty boring compared to other toys I've bought. The velcro black loop is not as sturdy either.
4,Good product but not enough lights,"This is another of the Whoozit line, and very faithful to the others. The fancy addition is two small blinking LEDs in the arms along with the music the toy plays. My daughter loves the toy- I was somewhat disappointed that there were not more lights on the toy- I think it could have had 8 to 10 lights on it. Also, you must continually pull down the string at the bottom of the toy to get it to light up and play the music- still too difficult for my daughter to do at 7 months, but I hope soon she'll master it."
4,fun for little hands,I never bought a whoozit for my 3 year old and always heard they were very educational. When I saw this I thought my 9 month old would love it. It it sweet and keeps his attention through meals for a few minutes. I still need a variety of toys but this has a few good features like music and lights.
1,never work from day 1,-received this item and it did not work from the day I received it--also this product has no instructions and no way to change batteries-
4,This is a nice foray into a lesser known style of music.,"For those of you who are looking for a little cultural variance, this album is a well-produced introduction into the world or Korean Traditional Music. It has overtones of some more energetic opera pieces while still reminding one of a culture not heavily explored. The strong three-beat of Korean music is brought out with a kind of kettle drum called the changgo. Most prevalent however is the zither-like instrument known as the komungo. Hearing An Bichwi sing the excerpts included on this album makes one want to hear a full 4-hour production. Truly if one is unable to experience this music live, this is the next best thing."
3,Editing problems,"I was set to love this book. Really, all the good reviews inspired me, and I love Time Travel books. To be completely honest, I'm not done yet, but I think it's important to warn people that the writing is amateurish and there are loads of spelling, grammatical and editing errors thoughout. They made me want to throw the book across the room many, many times. I think people should know that before buying it. I will write again when I'm done. I have kept reading only because the story is supposed to be fantastic. Stay tuned.**Update: I have finished the book, and still have the same opinion as above. The story is good, but could have been executed much better. The idea is good."
2,This book was given to me by a former friend,"Since the book was written at a 10th grade level , I was able to complete in a few hours. The bright spot is that I did read the book from cover to cover, however the dark cloud is that I want those 4 hours of my life returned to me.The main character, Dr. Merideth is a bumbling goof who is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, or maybe the author is showing her lack of brain power.I must admit , I did find a great use for the book , I threw it at my dog after he made a mess on the kitchen floor."
3,Useful...only fair condition,"The writing style guide arrived in a timely manner and was very useful in my graduate studies. However, the ""comb"" (the plastic binding) was broken in a number of places so it was difficult to keep the pages together."
4,"Powerful, lightweight, and worked great.","I found that I needed much more power than my old 30W soldering iron could provide, to complete a thick wire (AWG 10) to large battery-clamp connection. The ""boost"" feature in this soldering gun was exactly what I needed and worked great."
2,"Looks substantial, but it's not","At first blush this iron looks fairly substantial. It looks like it should be able to solder thick wire and handle other heavy jobs but its quirky ""Therma Boost"" feature that is supposed to make it a 130 watt iron is lacking.At its heart this is a 30 watt iron. The idea is that you can pull the trigger to get a ""boost"" of heat and make it a 130 watt iron. Unfortunately, once you pull the trigger, you get a brief increase of heat, but then the ""boost"" turns off and it gets cool again. The iron has a built-in duty cycle limiter so you can only activate the boost feature once every couple minutes or so. If you weren't done soldering when the boost turns off, then too bad -- you'll have to wait a few minutes before you can get another boost of heat.Overall this iron is kind of gimmicky and you should get an iron that perform at a high wattage for a 100% duty cycle."
2,solder gun,needs more power. May be fine to burn wood but bad to solder wire connections. Not fine enough for board soldering or big enough for larger wire.
3,just ok,"this soildering iron IS just ok... First off,DO NOT FORGET TO UNPLUG IT WHEN UR DONE, it does NOT have an off switch... its on if its plugged in like i found out after it being on All nite, it was really frickin hot. This is possibly dangerous.It just works ok anyway"
3,Weller hot knife,"This cutter is slow to get hot enough to cut paracord but it works, if you wait for it to get hot."
1,Tips not available,"Similar to Radio Shack soldering guns, replacement tips are not available.Too pay over $20 for a tool and not have accessories available seems senseless."
5,Music for the soul,I love to relax to this music .... it touches my soul and uplifts the world around me. Great music!
2,Boring,Ahm...excuse me. This is unfortunately NOT the passion of Flamenco and surely not the experimental of Jazz.I would not recommend this CD to the deep Flamenco or deep Jazz lovers.
3,Glitches in Kindle edition!,"Enjoyable, quick read.There are glitches in the Kindle edition! The first letters in the first sentences of most sections are missing!"
2,"Bear Jaws 4""","Save your money and buy another name brand. Although made in the USA, workmanship and quality were not what I expected. The finish is fair overall, but the plier head casting had minute chips/flaws along the edge of the serations of the needlenose. The opening and closing of the tool takes all my hand strength, (I weigh 240, 6'2""). I have oiled it heavily and worked it a bit to loosen it up to no avail so far. The friction is actually creating heat and warming the tool head up. Tool release arms stick out and get in the way of the tools which also are extremely stiff to get out. I had to pry the can open out of the body with my Leatherman Wingman, maybe had threadlocker on the joint, I dunno, first tool I have had that operates so hard, I don't even want to bother with it. I'll leave it alone for a while and let the lubricant do its' magic, and see what happens, but overall I am disappointed, and would not recommend it."
3,"Subtitled ""An Extravagent Life""","This book is subtitled ""An Extravagant Life,"" and is available in hardcover. Laurence Bergreen also wrote ""Louis Armstrong: An Extrodinary Life"" Unfortunately I got the impression that Mr. Bergreen became a little disillusioned with his subject. He glosses over Armstrong's flaws. For instance, Bergreen seems to accept Louis' infidelities were the result of bad advice about women he received in his adolescence! His relationship and treatment of his mentor Joe Oliver is also rather quickly dismissed. I wish more time was spent on these parts of Armstrong's life. I can't fault the research and musical analysis, though."
4,GOOD LOOKING GUITAR,I am very pleased with the look and feel of my new OE30 However I am having trouble setting it up. The g string goes flat when ever you press a chord . I put Gibson .011 strings on and got rid of the very light strings that came with it. I also lowered the tail a little and it seems better.Also there was no manual or book explaining tone and volume buttons so I am learning from trial and error. I solved all set up problems by moving the g string saddle all the way towards the bridge and using a wound g string this cleaned up the tuning problems. Thanks the Vinman
5,Awesome guitar,"This guitar's main strength is its electronics, I was blown away by the clarity and definition of the sound it produces. It looks decent and came in a safe packaging. The light strings that it came with do the job alright, but I would recommend changing them as soon as possible. Realize that intonation is way off when you get it, fix it before playing.Good guitar for the price, five star all the way!"
3,Not as good as the first 2 books in the series,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 books in this series. I was disappointed in this book. The storyline wasn't as appealing. However, I did search to see if there were any more stories coming in the series. I did like the main characters and wanted to read more."
1,Can't,"I don't hate this book, I just cant rate it because it never made it to me and my money was refunded. I hope to find it out here some where again, then i could give some feedback"
3,"Good ending, but lulled through the rest","I have always found Palmer's first books in trilogies to be the best. I had a hard time reading this one, and skimmed over more than the first half of the book. The plot picked up at the end, but I would like to see more involvement of the former characters. It's still a good series I would recommend, though."
2,Boring,I am a science teacher and hoped to use this to teach when watching the new Hobbit movieThe book was not real helpfulMostly just opinions and and the author talking to themsevles
1,This book killed my Kindle!,"This download killed all of my saved books and now I can't redownload them. I can't even check out books from the library anymore, no new files work. Stay awy from the Kindle version!!"
5,The Best,I came across the CD accidentally and I love it. It is Timeless and shows the bridge between the African and South American continents. Powerful drumming and great ENERGY!!! Highly recommended
3,Half and Half,"The first half is incredible, powerful brazillian drums and singing make this an energized and original and fun beginning. But somewhere around the middle, the sound gets very produced with organs and electronic sounds. It goes from raw to overproduced. still a great cd but not as great as the first 5 tracks."
5,Sergio is Amazing!!!,Soulful Samba man. This will have you moving to the Samba beats in the car or on the dance floor
2,Salvador or Hollywood?,"This may be better than his 70's and 80's pop drivel that the other reviewers are mentioning, but the ultra-glossy production values and an overabundance of synthesizers make it very difficult for me to listen to all but a few tracks on this record.I tried to sell the record back to the used cd store I bought it from (for $6) and they wouldn't take it - they said they already had too many copies of this CD."
2,Not for the kitch loving bossa nova crowd,"I was not into this album. The first couple of tracks are exciting, whistle blowers, but the rest of the album dissolves into a fusion jazz experience that I don't go for. This is nothing like Brasil '66, which is what I was hoping for. If you like Jazz fusion w/ a couple accoustic festival numbers thrown in, this CD is for you."
4,Sergio Grooves!,"I was a big fan of Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66. I really didn't care for the pop things he was doing in the late 70's-80's. So I was hesitant with this CD. But I am pleasantly surprised with the soulfulness of this album. Sergio gets back to his Brazilian roots and puts in a GREAT effort. I could have done without the rap thing, but other than that this was a really good record. The rhythm just GROOVES throughout! I'll start buying his records again if he's gonna make 'em like this!"
1,Expired product with date erased,I've bought these pills in the past and they come like the picture shows. I ordered 4 of these and they were all out of the plastic wrap but still in the foil. On closer inspection I could see the date was erased. I can faintly see 2008 and 2010 on the pills. The buyer refunded me and said he does not sell expired products. I can would be more understanding if the dates weren't erased but this was purposefully done. I will post pictures later if I can. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER: SMART-CART!!!
5,iOSAT Potassium Iodide Tablets,"I'm glad I got them in light of the Japanese nuclear radiation spread to the US. I wonder if the government will let me know when I need to use the tablets? I don't know the radiation level when they are necessary or given the situation if they will do any good. I don't think the radiation will stop before Jesus comes back to save us. Oh well, I'll take them if the government informs us that it will do any good."
5,Good to have just in case,"I have not used the product, because I have no reason to, but they will be in my house available to my family if needed. They come packed in good quality material, kind of like what the foil type packaging that cold meds come in so they would hold up well in a bag on the go or in a cabinet. I would recommend anyone who lives close to a nuclear facility or those just who like to be prepared get some because when you need them it will be too late to find them."
1,already send? maybe no !,"I orderd them November 15, 2012 from Japan.But don't still receive them.Too lateI don't know when I receive."
3,Pills,Were as I hope never to use these pills I feel a little safer knowing I have them in my survival kit.
4,The one thing I bought that I hope I never have to use!,"The product appears well packaged, I am not sure on quality ofcourse but hopefully will do the trick when needed."
5,great value,"I haven't had occasion to use this item, but I have it should I need it. The price was terrific and I'm glad to have it."
3,No Expire Date,"I just recevied this product,looks good but i like to see the expired date on it,how does anybody know if they are expired,so people beware what you get."
5,vital piece of health insurance,"Read about the spent fuel pool at Fukushima #4, researched the product and this is the best of the bunch. Think of it as a dollar per year per person insurance against radiation poisoning (given the 8 year shelf life) in the event of an emergency, be it the fuel pools at Fukushima or elsewhere. I cannot imagine living anywhere on the West Coast, or west of the Mississippi for that matter, and not having this item on-hand. If there is a(nother) nuclear emergency, Potassium Iodide from any source will be unavailable within hours."
5,nice!,"well, there really isn't much to say about these. the only important info is that they arrived with a 2018 expiration date which make these a super great buy. Anyway, I think I hit the 20 word minimum."
4,"Package received in good condition, expiration date 2016","I'm hoping I'll never have to use these tablets, but we live near, and vacation near a nuclear power plant. I figure, after what happened in Japan, and earthquakes happening in our area, it doesn't hurt to have them on hand. The product is in good shape, and doesn't expire until 2016. Hopefully, it's a waste of money, but not much."
5,Prices,"Charge whatever you want...Folks should have kept some on hand when they were $10 a pack instead of waiting until doom arrives to buy them. I've been keeping my stock up to date since the early 90's, you folks crying the blues should have done the same."
5,Hopefully Not Needed,"Though I have't used this pills, they may come to save a life some day. The supplier got them to me in no time and is now in my survival kit."
5,I have em. Hope I don't need em.,Hope I don't need this! But what the heck like alot of these things I have it's just in case. I don't think any of us want to be in a real scenario where we have to resort to using these tablets.
1,Greed raises its ugly head in a disaster,We're trying to locate KI with the hope of fedexing it to colleagues and their families in Japan. It's a shame that there is no shortage of unscrupulous people who try to profiteer by other's suffering when a disaster occurs.
1,This is a rip off....do not buy,These people are trying to take advantage of Americans who are scared about the situation in Japan. Radiation is not coming to the United States from Japan. If it does the government will supply people with this for free. Do not pay these prices. This person is doing it just because everyone is scared!
3,How do I review this?,"I guess if I gave it 1 star I would have wasted my last time on the planet trying to power up a computer and post this before I died of radiation. I have them, they are sealed and I hope they work if I need them. Hope this helps"
1,Over double the price what this product normally goes for,I think it is shameful to gouge the price of this product and take advantage of peoples fears (current situation in Japan). Product normally sells for between $5-7 U.S.D.
5,"John Starnes Holy, Holy, Holy",This was my first contact with amazon.com and I was happy to find it was everything I had heard. My purchase was handled professionally and arrived on time in perfect condition. I will be using amazon again.
5,A bit of shantyboat history.,This was a copy in excellent shape of an obscure book about designing a shantyboat that drew a few inches of water. Great read if you're a fan of Phil Bolger or Jim Michalak boat designs. And go ahead and Google the Allyns -- Rube's dad was an original for sure.
4,Lost finish,"I'm not sure if one of the kids drop these on the sidewalk a few times, but they somehow lost their finish, and didn't bounce off each other and make the fun noise anymore."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Quality","I like the design, the colors but the the quality is bad. Within a few hours of use the stitching started coming apart. Would not recommend, belkin makes a similar product (without the button) and it is 10x as durable... The quality on this product is not worth the cost..."
2,It's leather but that's it,I bought this product to protect my Zune. Within a month the leather had ripped apart at the bottom leaving the case useless. The entire time I found that the case was difficult to use and didn't fit quite right. The holes lined up with the buttons and screen but the player kept sliding out so nothing would line up. Go with a silicone case instead because those stay in place.
3,A good history lesson,"Set against the brutal landscape of rebellion against religious repression, Gunpowder, Treason & Plot dramatizes the short reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, and the extraordinary battle of her son, James I, with the Catholic conspiracy against him. Guy Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot became one of the most scandalous events in English history, and remains to this day. An excellent way to learn about Guy Fawkes in an interesting manner."
1,Still not watched: Beware the Region Code!,We have a multi-region DVD player but still haven't been able to play the disc we received. Very disappointing!
3,pretty good,"This film has 2 parts. One part is very good. It has a love story, intrigue, and Kevin McKidd. As for the other part the only possitive thing I can say is good acting and Michael Fassbender is great. He is not in it much, but he still plays a great character. It's not everybodys kind of movie. But I'd say if your a real movie fan and history buff, watch it."
1,Junk,"I agree with another reviewer who said the iron takes a long time to heat up and the steam function requires pumping before it will work. Mine never did work unless I held the ""max steam"" lever down with one finger while trying to iron. It does not iron evenly - not even a much-washed cotton handkerchief. I am still looking for the perfect iron."
2,Beeps Incessantly & Leaks,We returned our previous Conair iron to Conair under a recall notice. They sent us this model(DPP3000C) in exchange. We have 2 problems with it: 1)It beeps all the time and drives us crazy. Can't figure out why it's beeping or how to turn it off. Instruction manual is no help. 2)The o-ring on the top lid where you pour the water in fell out and now it leaks water all over the clothes while ironing. We're just not hot on these digital irons. Just need a simple iron that gets hot and does the job. (And doesn't Beep every 30 seconds!)
5,The Cranberries are the best band in the whole world,"I can't wait for this cd to come out. I have been waiting for years. The Cranberries are the best, and this album is probably going to be their best one. Of course the other ones are good too. I am the biggest fan the cranberries have!"
2,Boring!,"I'm actually a CranFan. but this record... Haven't heard it more then two times... but it's not promising! I was very disapointed. I love Dolores' voice, but on this album she totally abused her voice and it sounded more like a little girl whining the the Dolores from the first three albums...This record won't be played to many times..."
1,Thought it was the packing foam,"When I opened the box, I thought the product did not get shipped. I only saw packing foam and then realized that was the product. Great idea, but really only about $1.00 worth of material."
5,Debunked!,"It's a good account of scientific explanation of those physical properties of matter that look paranormal to layman. Unexpected behaviors from a human, animal or even metal creates awe and false beliefs in paranormal activities. Nature is full of such phenomenon and I believe 99% of it is still hidden. I liked reading this book from scientific and a common man's point of view. At some points it may seem a little bit random but that is because it's hard to organize scientific explanation of paranormal for average layman. It's concise and yet adequately comprehensive fullfiling its purpose."
5,The most noble in music,The most amazing musician in my opinion. This CD and the other CD with his performances in Ragas Kapi and Pantuvarali are some of the greatest recordings on the Vina. The nobility of the musical tradition and the maturity of the music were very much a part of Chitti Babu's personality and his performances. It is an Amazingly emotional experience to listen to Chitti Babu every time.
5,A wonderful concert of Javanese gamelan,"Under the large pendapa (open hall) the musicians of the court of Mangkunagaran play two sacred gamelans. These consist only of 'loud' bronze instruments with a very rich deep sound. This makes the structure of the music more transparent than the usual Solonese style. Still, the music expresses a very rich range of nuances in this excellent recording, both in the quality of sound and in the musicianship of the gamelan players. Highly recommended for those who know the genre, and those who want to make its acquaintance."
4,Clinique Quickliner in Moss is what I like for under my eyes,"* Clinique Quickliner in Moss is what I like for under my eyes* These eyeliners go on smooth* They give more of natural look for every day use* Would try the Guerlain, Giorgio Armani or MAC for night time looks* Comparable drugstore products would be the Neutrogena Nourishing Eyeliner, L'Oreal HIP eyeliner, OR Physicians Formula Eyeliner* A good product for the price."
5,Excellent...!!!,"My wife loves this pen, for the quality and durability of color even any climate, she said that Clinique is the best."
1,Not really liking it,Reason for my dislike is because it smudges so easy. By the end of the day your eyes look like you've rubbed them while having all this eyeliner on.Also the eyeliner does not go on so smoothly you have to keep pressing and going over the line.
1,Not a great find,The pencil does not glide on like it should. Do you need a special sharpener? Would not buy again. Waste of money
3,Beware the fine print,"I ordered the product in my normal shoe size. Unfortunately it was painfully short - at least a full size too short for a narrow foot.So I think 'No problem - Amazon has a great return policy'.I fill out the return form online, print the RMA & send 'em back.But Amazon does not include mis-sizing as a 'reason for return' on the RMA. Since the decision to return the shoes was just my own choice then Amazon does not reimburse for return shipping.I guess it really doesn't matter though. Two weeks have gone by since I returned them and there has been no sign of a refund anyway.My last three orders have been jacked one one way or the other (only one of three pieces delivered on one order - 35 days to get the complete product and the other product listed in stock - two weeks and it hasn't been shipped. the part that burns is that Amazon just has this lackadasical attitude ""... too bad - whatever"""
2,Great Book poor quality,"This is one of my favorite books in hard print but I was looking for something easier to take with me into the chapel. Sadly, this is not the copy you want. While the entire text of the book is present the formatting on this edition is atrocious. It looks like the text was simply copied from a website and converted into Kindle format.While there are no grievous errors the readability is reduced. Further, the notes are not linked--they are inserted immediately within the text making it very hard to get from one portion of the ""story"" to another.For the same price you can get another version of this book (Amazon had several choices) or just go with the full ""True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary"" which is the later and expanded version of this text by the same author."
3,Something was missing in Civil Brand,"In your Classic Women's Prison flick (ie: Pam Grier in ""Big Doll House"", ""Women in Cages"", etc. ), There is almost always a shower scene and/or a scene when the women first arrive in prison and they are stripped and hosed down and the Correction Officers check their various orifices for drugs. Neither was in this movie so I feel cheated for not being able to see all those beautiful Nubian Women in a nice hot and steamy shower scene. I mean c'mon!! LisaRaye, N'Bushe Wright, Da Brat, Monica Calhoun and Lark Voorhies and NO SHOWER SCENE?!!!! Other than that MAJOR miss, the film was decent."
2,Don't mess with Jailed females!!!,"I recall when this movie was being filmed. Lisa Raye did an interview about the movie. The film is about prison being big business. The women are being exploited, abused and enough is enough. The final straw is when one character ends up dies. Lisa Raye plays Francis Shepeard who is in prison for killing her abusive husband. She ends up heading an all out boycott on the prison conditions. Da Brat is Sabrina and she is the narrator. Which is cool, because her acting leaves much to be desired. The movie is okay, but I think the movie would have been better if we could have seen a flashback about Francis' character having to deal with her husband. The movie is okay."
4,This Civil Is The Perfect Brand,"This movie is a winner.With an alstar beautiful cast with so much talent.They are LisaRaye, Tichina Arnold, N'Busche Wright, Monica Calhoun, Lark Voorhies,Da Brat, Mc Lyte and even Mos Def.The plot is so importaant and this is a great movie.Its baout women who too a stand because they were tired of their hard labor and sexist treatment while they are in prison.These women all shien in this movie and among that it has won many awards at film festivals even BEST PICTURE.I remeber reading amagazine and seeing an ad in a magazine for a movie after that i never heard anything else about it.NExt thing i know i was walking thorugh Wal-Mart and saw the DVD.I never seen it before so i bought it and loved it..BOTTOM LINE THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION FOR EVERYONEOVERALL GRADE 97/100 = A"
3,Music CD,I did like the music on this cd but thought the price was way to high for only one cd. Thank you
4,Terrific book,"How about those gossiping ladie folk. That killed me when Gogol eventually let their names slip out. Terrific book, too bad it has such a sloppy ending. Still, a must read for all lovers of Russian literature....4.5 stars"
5,Best gift!,"Sushi Chef, Sushi Making Kit, 1 EA (Pack of 3)Gave this as a birthday gift for a sushi lover. LOTS of neat ingredients. Great value"
3,"Don't know the quality of this gift, but I do know that it's heavy: should have shipped directly to sister...","The kit was a gift, so I don't know how good the product really is. But I can recommend that if you buy this as a gift for someone, have it shipped directly to them. It's really heavy and reshipping was expensive."
3,Good if you don't want to just get the stuff on your own for a lot less...,"It's an ok set if you don't want to go out and buy these very basic ingredients and two simple tools (bamboo mat and wooden spatula) on your own for a lot less. This REALLY SHOULD INCLUDE A SMALL JAR OF TOASTED SESEME SEEDS for the money you are paying but doesn't!But it does get you started and will allow you to make some basic sushi. Like other people have said the cookbook included is just terrible!! It talks about toasting the nori even though the package of nori already says ""toasted nori""! The cookbook is just terrible. In trying to follow it to the letter for making the rice I burned the hell out of it! But you learn what you realy need to do quickly.Bottom line the cookbook included is about the worst cookbook ever written, the ""kit"" could be gotten for half as much or less, and it should have included sesame seeds.. Still a decent gift and will get you started."
2,Rip off,I bought this as a present for a very good friend. Because of the price I paid for it I was expecting something really nice. I was very disappointed to see that the kit was made up of very cheap items that if bought individually will come up to 1/3 of the price. The kit contains mainly ingredients not sushi making equipment. I would suggest that you look around for a better more reasonable set.
2,Questionable Condition,I believe this product is good for the beginner and is helpful however when I received mine the two bottles of vinegar were not sealed properly and the wasabi seal was clearly broken. I do not fault amazon as they quickly provided me with a refund. Other than that i think the product was helpful especially the bamboo mat for rolling the sushi.
5,Everything Here,"This is a great sushi making kit. It has everything you need. If you are just getting into making your own sushi, then this is the perfect kit to get you going!"
5,excellent sushi making kit,"excellent sushi making kit , i was able to make for a few people. i love it."
1,Not what I was expecting,I recieved this product as a gift for a friend. When he opened it we found that there was mold present. Not a fan and very disappointing.
3,More of a novelty gift item than a true kit to make sushi.,"This kit is not really worth the price. The instruction booklet is very brief, does not cover much of the how-to involved. The items included are fine, but I think one could do better at a regular asian grocery store. This would be a nice novelty gift for housewarming or Christmas, but as far as a truely useful kit, it leaves much to be desired."
4,Got us started on Sushi,"Despite the serious doubts of my Japanese colleague (""Your wife's gonna be pi**ed""), this was a hit as a Christmas gift. It got us started on our own sushi-making journey, and that is exactly what it was supposed to do. Several other reviewers are correct that you can get the ingredients cheaper if you shop around, but this is a nice box, the ingredients work and taste well, and it gets you started with no fuss.A few hints from using it:- put the bamboo mat in a large ziploc for easy cleanup- just cook rice normally (at the lower end of the recommended amount of water), and then mix in the vinegar. The rice-cooking method described in the included booklet seems somewhat too complicated.- we also got the Sushezi sushi maker, and the combo is hard to beat"
4,Sushi kit,"We are reallyt happy with this kit. I purchased an additional sushi book which elaborates on techniques more fully, and we're enjoying getting into making our own sushi. I'm sure the professionals do it more efficiently, but there's definitely some fun in preparing this type of cuisine for friends and yourself. Everything's in the box, including a small sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are tricky to find in supermarkets. The book could definitely be more extenzive, but for small money, it seems to be a good deal and a lot of fun."
1,Where is it?,"I place an order for this kit on december first and was told it should arrive on the 6th. I've not received my product, not heard from the manufacturers, not able to find a number or anything for me to contact them and want this product for my brother for christmas. So if anyone could help me, I would appreciate it. This is my first time every using amazon before as well. Not such a good first impression..."
5,Great place to start!,I had always wanted to learn how to make sushi (its so expensive when you go out to eat). A friend bought me this for my birthday and I really enjoyed and and want to recommend it to anybody who wants to get into making sushi.
2,Not a good start,"Whatever you do, don't follow their instructions for steaming rice. You will end up with a burnt pot of crap. Secondly, there isn't enough rice in the package for a second try. Go buy some short grain rice and follow the package instructions for cooking/steaming rice. Then go back to the Sushi Chef instructions for cooling/seasoning the rice. Good thing I spent all that time preparing ingredients for making sushi while the rice was burning. Now I have to go out for more rice."
3,"ok, but could have got ingredients for much less.","The kit gave us the kick in the butt we needed to start making our own sushi, but if we had really sat down and thought about it, we could have saved about half just buying the stuff ourself. You can buy most of what you need at your local grocery store. Would I recommend this product? Only if you are lazy like us!"
3,"Good kit for beginners, but poor food quality","This had everything in it that we needed to make our own sushi rolls, but the quality of the food inside the kit (rice, ginger, wasabi, and seaweed) was pretty poor. The tools in it (rolling mat and spoon) and we enjoyed it. Wouldn't buy a second kit, but the first one was worth it."
4,Great for beginners!,"It has everything you need for trying your hand at sushi. It helps to have a nice sharp knife. We didn't have a very good sushi knife so it kind of shredded the roll. The seasoned sushi vinegar is great. Now that I have run out, I have to make some seasoned vinegar, which isn't too hard... But it was nice to have it in the one bottle. The nori sheets included don't taste that great, but they are alright to work with. The ""recipe book"" doesn't have a lot of recipes, so I'd recommend looking up your own recipes, or get creative!"
5,Must-have for the beginner,"This is the set that got us started on our own sushi roll making adventures! I love having the package together to get me started, as the oriental grocery stores in the nearby city can be a little daunting. Buy this to begin your sushi making along with this bookSushi For Dummies. You'll probably want the physical book because you'll want to have it on hand when actually ROLLING the sushi and your fingers will be so dirty, you won't want to mess up your kindle."
3,"basic kit, decent for beginners, but very baseline","This is a pretty basic kit, and fine for beginners, but the items aren't the best quality. Personally, I'd opt for something better at the same price from sushinut which is where I get my sushi grade fish anyway. Sushi kits are always better when some thought was put into it, this is just one brand's stuff, for better or worse, but I'd opt for better quality for myself and my friends."
1,Very bad,"Item arrived all moldy inside, it had to be broken for some time before. Nobody noticed the mold before packing for shippment."
2,not worth the money disappointed,didn't live up to my expectation.as others have said can go and purchase same items at a cheaper price.very disappointed
4,not bad,"The kit contains everything you need besides the fish so it is a really great kit. Makes an awesome gift but I reccomend going to a store and purchasing. When it arrived in the mail, the lid on the wasabi container was shattered and the rice bag was torn open and rice was everywhere... luckily it was all contained in a plastic wrapped packaging so the rice was contained in the orginal packaging but it was a gift for my boyfriend so I was disappointed when it arrived and we opened it. We just put the wasabi in one of our own tupperweare container and the loose rice in a ziplock bag."
4,Mesmerizing and fun,"From screaming anguish to childlike joy, this set by the Cure immediately pulls you in for a trip trough the swings and binges of Robert Smith's soul. The Cure have always provided great music supporting honest lyrics, and this is one of their best discs."
3,the beginning of the end,"I'm a diehard Cure fan. However, to me this cd represents the beginning of the Cure's demise as a great band. It is all right but definitely not of the calibre of their earlier albums. A little too happy, a little too radio friendly. But there are still some songs worth listening on ""Wish""."
5,on of the best albumz i've ever heard...,"this is by far on of the best albumz i've ever heard! i purchased this a few years back and am now decideing to write a review. here it iz""""it'z great, get it now!"""
4,"It's good, ""Trust"" me.","I initially didn't care much for ""Wish"", but now I call it their best from the 90's. After the consistency of ""Disintegration"", this album was released and reminds me more of the ""Head On The Door/Kiss Me"" albums in its diversity. It's also rather lengthy at 66 minutes. ""Wish"" has the epics, the moody pieces, and the hits, all in one disc. I truly love each song, but the better ones are ""High"", ""Apart"", ""A Letter To Elise"", and ""End"". ""Friday I'm In Love"" might be their biggest hit ever, but like many Cure fanatics, I've heard it once too often. This is a good starting point for new fans, after one of the collections I guess. Overall, I'd call ""Wish"", ""Bloodflowers"", and the live album ""Paris"" the best of their last 15 years."
4,Good Things Come To Those Who Wish,"To review the Cure is like judging art- tastes change and fads come and go and through it all is the sound of Robert Smith. Many Cure fans disregard this release as commercial and for many the thought of this CD faded just as soon as ""Friday I'm in Love"" fell from MTV rotation. (Please note that there was a time when Music Television played what were called ""music videos"") Cure fans should revisit ""Wish"" often and enjoy the fine music it has to offer. Open, High, Apart, From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea, Doing the Unstuck, Friday I'm in Love, A Letter to Elise, and End stack up with the best of the Cure's work and make ""Wish"" one of their best pieces of art."
4,Second best Cure album,"Second best Cure album only to Disintegration. Songs range from beautiful, atmospheric tracks such as ""from the edge of the deep green sea"" to hard rockers such as ""cut"". Their most solidly diverse album containing no throwaway tracks. Robert Smith nails it again with his beautiful, mostly sorrowful lyrics. My favorite tracks are ""doing the unstuck"" and ""a letter to elise"", but all are great."
2,Far From Like New,Cd case was cracked in all directions and cd itself had a white cloudy substance all over it. Not very happy with this purchase.
5,Pack it for the desert island...,"My wife asked me yesterday for my top 7 albums that I would take to a desert island. Much to my amazement this album came third in the list - even though I hadn't played it for a while. Playing it non-stop since then reminds me how these wonderful songs lift the spirit and make me feel GOOD (+ I am no big Cure fan). ""Doing the Unstuck"" must be the ultimate in ""self improvement/life change"" songs whereas the rest of the songs take you on an emotional and romantic journey not expected of the Cure. I will surely pack it in along with the other six..."
4,Mass Effect 1 (The Start),"The best thing I liked about this game is the story line. It kept me wanting to know more as I played it. As a fan of fiction and anything to do with space exploration, I felt like this game truly got what I was looking for. The game allows you to have conversations with party members and allows you to make your own decisions that will later impact the story of the game, giving you the power to call the shots. The characters are also unique and what you do with them will play a large role in the story line. The aliens are extremely realistic and combat really puts you as the main character of this unique and interesting story.I would not suggest this game to children since there is content intended for mature audiences only.Other than that this game is recommend especially if you wish to play the sequel (which by the way takes this game to a whole other level)."
5,40 hours of amazing story,This game is amazing. Its a good solid 40 hour RPG. Your choices dont really goes as deep as the series says but you still go about achieving your goals how you want.I noticed on a second play through that a Renegade is not a bad guy.A Paragon is a unmoving beacon of light in the shadows.A Renegade does whatever he has to make sure the mission is a success.You could play Mass Effect 2 without playing this but I think to see the whole picture its best to play the first game as well.
5,"If you haven't played it yet, grab it now","In my opinion, this is by far the best game out there. Bioware have become the masters of video game story telling, introducing characters you will truly care about and whose view of you will change based on how you play the game.If you are just getting into Mass Effect (what took you so long?) I'd suggest taking a look at the trilogy pack recently released."
4,Mass Effect,Excellent game with an overwhelming amount of possible gameplay. You are virtually unlimited in what you can do and create. Endless possibilities and the graphic are simply amazing!
2,What is the big deal?,"I bought this game based on the fact that it was one of the highest-rated 360 games on Metacritic (91). I can't say I agree. Mass Effect is definitely top-notch as far as graphics and depth and voice acting goes, but the gameplay just didn't seem all that interesting to me.The third-person combat system is not very impressive and the action sequences seem very brief. I felt like I spent a lot of time just walking around and talking to people, standing in elevators, and driving my APC around generic planets looking for combat. When I'd finally get in combat, I would get relatively far and then die and have to start all the way back at the beginning.I've probably played the game for at least 10 hours and don't feel like I've really accomplished all that much. Maybe it gets better as you play further but I'm not willing to invest any more time in it to find out. Great concept and production values but the action wasn't done well enough to keep me interested."
4,Mass Effect,graphically detailed visual piece; can spend hours at a time playing this game; sometimes a little unsettling that you have to go so far back in the game if you should sucumb to an untimely demise
3,Like watching a masterpiece painting burn before your eyes...,"I can't express the utter disappointment I have with the latest offering from the proven Bioware team. For some reason, critics and fanboys are willing to forgive the fact that the game is completely unfinished, with a nonexistent caching system, wonky controls, repetitive ""dungeons"", lackluster battle system and the worst item/inventory lists ever. The saving grace, of course, is the dialog tree system which makes it half bearable to find out what the writers have waiting in their space addled brains. And the story is what keeps the critics happy. But, honestly, I could have enjoyed reading the book instead of punishing myself with hours of boring gameplay to get to a story that had a striking resemblance to another space epic already emulated by Bioware in the past....Ugh. Why ship it if it ain't fixed?"
2,"Slow, confusing, frustrating","After hearing and reading so many positive reviews of ME, I thought I'd give it a try. ME has a lot going for it -- a rich story, great graphics, and hours of gameplay. The only trouble is that the game is incredibly tedious. I spent at least two hours at the beginning just running around a space station jib-jabbing with people, and getting completely lost in the process. They tell you to go here, then there, then back again...ugh.Then when something entertaining does actually take place, they don't give you enough checkpoints. One mission I was nearly 30 minutes into, then *bam* -- I died from a fluke and had to start all over again.I really wanted to like ME, but it's a drag."
4,What effect?,This game grew on me. It took me a while to get used to it and for me to finally decide that I did in fact enjoy the game. The decisions that you make during this game will affect the outcome of many of the situations the characters get in. Play it through at least twice.
4,Total Awesomeness...with a few bugs,"I bought this game for my husband, and the title of this review was his quote. He plays the game every night, I have to drag him away from it just to go to bed. Although it is a bit buggy, overall the game is totally worth every penny. The game is tons of fun, very customizable, and worth playing a few times, just to see how the story goes with different decisions. DEFINTIELY buy this if you loved Knights of the Old Republic."
4,Mass Effect - Not Bad At All,"Mass effect lived up to the hype without a doubt. Not only does it deliver a creative storyline, it also allows the gamer to take the story where they want it to go based on decisions and key events during the game. The best part is the fact that the gamer gets to detail their character, literally, down to the very scars on their faces and the shapes of their faces. Naturally, they also have a wide variety of classes & skills to choose from. It's basically like Starcon II meets Final Fantasy. I really enjoyed the ""free space"" aspect that allowed me to deviate as much as I wanted from the main mission and explore other planets and stumble across side missions. I've already played and beaten this game once, and have already started playing it again. Very worth the purchase!"
4,"Ehhh, Ok","First let me just say that this game is fun, but don't build it up in your mind while waiting for it in the mail. I waited for this game for three weeks (truck strike here in italy), the whole time I would listen to people who owned the game say how much fun it was to play. Naturally, I was building up this mental picture of how this game was going to blow me away. I was wrong, but that might be my own fault. Also, I only have a standard def TV. Maybe that's the reason for this, but I didn't think the grafics were all that great for a next gen game. Bioshock, Halo or Gears owns in that category."
5,A must for Sci Fi,This game is amazing! The depth of the story and character development is great. The nice thing is that you can play this game more than once and still get a different experience each time. The leveling up is traditional rpg style which is what makes this game work so well. Truly on the best games I have ever played in my twenty years as a video game geek.
3,Has some slow parts.,"Lots of running between areas, going up or down in elevators (with time for a sound track!!!) come on guys focus on game play."
4,If you have the MS points you don't need it,If you have Mass effect 2 you can download a little plugin called Mass Effect Genisis that will allow you to make the critical choices of this game and have them relelected in Mass effect 2. If your Loading up for 3 then i would recommend you get Mass effect genisis to save you a lot of time. If you have 15 minutes you can save wrex and do whatever you want. I would say if you want to go through mass effect thats ok too but the SSV Normandy crash sight is a bit of a heart breaker as i was really attatched to the M-35 Mako. what i did was traded it on 2 then my xbox blew out and i had to start over then i found Genisis on the cerberus network and that was 40 hours i was able to spend making Selene Sheapard ready for 3. Trust me Genisis will save you a boatload of time that you can use to complain about the ending of 3 insted
2,"Should be Called ""MESS EFFECT""","I can't understand how anybody could rate this game over 2 stars. This is one of the worst games I have ever played, due to mediocre graphics, bad framerate (I thought I was playing on a slow PC sometimes), and excrutiatingly boring side missions. I actually bought MASS EFFECT 2 first. I started playing it, and decided to play the first one. I figured I would finish #1 and go back to #2. ME2 did not have the technical issues as ME1 did. Anybody that says the graphics in ME1 is great must be color blind. How this game got past quality control is beyond me."
5,Game of the Year or maybe tied for it with Bioshock,"This game is just beautiful. It's like playing the cut scenes and the way the text trees are set up you really get drawn into the game. The fighting is excellent, think Rainbow Six Vegas in third person. It has a somewhat the same cover system. I love it, Game of the Year."
4,Mass Effect,"If you love Science Fiction in any way, shape, or form, Mass Effect is the game for you. Despite a few technical issues, the game convincingly thrusts you into an epic tale of galactic peril, at the center of which lies a character of your own creation. The choices you make using the unique conversation wheel sway your reputation towards lawful (Paragon) or reckless (Renegade). The game has several classes from which to choose, ranging from the straightforward soldier to the Jedi-like Biotic user. The storyline is truly the best part of this game, getting especially juicy in the last hour or so.If Sci Fi is your thing, do your self a favor and buy Mass Effect. You won't regret it."
5,awesome!!!!!,The game is better than I expected. the second play through gave me diferent missions so the game never got boring. Ver excited about the game still.
1,Please read the reviews,The beginning of the game has to much to do as far as profile. After playing the game I know they warn you about after effects to you physically and ppl should read it cause it does happen. I had a headache that lasted for days. I felt dizzy and nausaed for days. Anyone want to buy this game from me let me know. I hate it.
2,Yuck - Can't stand it!,"I'm playing this on xbox360. Maybe I'm just too used to playing on PC, yet again I haven't played a game since Jedi Knight II over 10 years ago and I'm freakin' shocked to see how bad this game is considering the favorable reviews. The dialogue is crap and choppy, the action is completely lacking for the first 3 hours. You basically walk around getting lost for ever; accessing the map is painful and hard to get your bearings. Countless & pointless side missions. Hard to use special skills. Annoying 'squad' members. The worst: the long elevator rides; seriously, some elevators take 45 seconds to arrive at the destination which makes me want to punch something.Why do I give it only 2 stars? Because I have slightly more fun playing Angry Birds. This game is such a freaking waste of time."
2,Not a fan.,i thought this was going to be a big open world like Oblivion but its not. its really lame and the cover system sucks really bad. i think the voice actings good and the graphics are nice but thats not enough to make this game enjoyable.. the fighting is just anti climatic and when you kill somone they always fall in this sortof wierd arching position its really wierd and hard to exlpain but i guess that means that there still using canned animation which is kindof lame.
2,A lot of hype,"I bought this game to try and get caught up with the series for the release of Mass Effect 3. The graphics are impressive and the story and background behind it is interesting. My problems stem from the stagnant dialogue and, frankly, boring gameplay. I always feel like I'm missing something though, as if there's another layer to the game I haven't caught onto yet. I'm still trudging through, trying to find this missing component."
2,Not a very good 3d shooter,"Keep in mind i dont generally like 3d shooters. I bought this game as a sci-fi RPG... which it isnt. After a few days play, the only RPG elements i have found is that you get to pick 2 team members (out of 5 or so) to run out in front of you and block your shots when the badguys rush in.This game world has a lot of background, and youll spend your first couple play sessions reading about all the various races and their political struggles.. then youll spend another couple days on some tedious shooter runs... then you'll go pick up a good game instead."
2,A 360 failure,"After about 2hrs (forced myself past an 1hr) I can already say this is one of the most boring games ive yet to play on the 360. I tried to convince myself that it was going to get better, but it didnt and now im mad because i wasted 8.60 at blockbuster.reasons being: repetitive, The conversations are too damn long,lame sound effects,not to mention this game ripped off of halo's designs and characters as well as a whole bunch of other games. Its just boring, I dont even have to try and convince the average 360 player on how lame it is, in fact im surprised people have given this more than 2 stars!No action, no fun factor, no life, as you could care less about the miscellaneous characters.If your looking for a good xbox RPG, go with Knights of the Old Republic, now that was fun."
3,Read the reviews carefully.,"Though the used price made the buy easier, I was still disappointed by certain levels and immediately offered it for sale to fellow players. Some things can make the game boring. Maybe I'm accustomed to faster paced games and though this game is favored by quite a few, its not my style.May, 2011. My bad. Sorry, by not having the instructions on how the game is played, I've made an error in downplaying one of the best games I ever found. Buying it used with no instructions, I didn't realize how to play the game properly. It has been an adventure in the least when thru experimentation a whole new concept appeared. Now with every turn or discovery, I have to rate it 5 stars.Yep, one must read the instructions, but worse, not to have them at all."
4,"Long, a bit repetetive, but glorious","A stunningly good game, worthy of being included alongside the classic Bioware triumphs like KOTOR and the Baldur's Gate series. Mass Effect is perhaps a bit too long, and the combat is nothing to write home about, but the feel of the game is epic from start to finish, a glorious space opera that doesn't stop until the final moment. The story is detailed and complicated, the universe is fully and exhaustively fleshed out and whole, and the voice acting, to my abject astonishment, is actually damn good.I can't recommend Mass Effect highly enough."
4,great game. stupid mako.,"ok. this game is great. i bought it and basically played it for 30 hours straight and not even close to done yet. i'm just exploring and such. and will definitely play this game over and over again (to unlock the achievements and to experience different character modes and such). four stars because driving/attacking in the mako sucks. i didn't realize the other reviewers really meant it when they said that driving this machine sucked. now i realize how annoying it gets. anyways, overall, it's a great game. but i dropped one star because you do spend a lot of time in the mako driving around worlds and such. i would suggest though getting out to attack rather than using the canon/guns on the mako."
4,"Good game, but don't play KotOR first.","I have enjoyed this game and will be starting two and three soon, but being from the same producers as KotOR (Knights of the Old Republic) I had a little higher expectations for the RPG aspects. Overall still a good game and I would be happy to recommend it."
4,Fast and Quick,Hey thanks next time a buy a game that needs to get here asap Im ordering from you again the game got here in three days flat which is really impressive
5,Great game but one problem not related.,This is an amazing game I enjoyed every minute of it. But just the other day my xbox started to tell me that it could not read the disk that is when i found out that the disk had a small circular scratch going around the edge of the disk. I am in the process of exchanging it right now but other that the scratch this was an amazing game that I would recommended to anyone who loves a game with a good story.
3,Not what I was expecting,"I rented this game from gamefly and i was a little dissapointed. I took a look at the reviews and thought this was going to be a great game. Right at the start i could tell that they must be blind. The game has a lame storyline. The aiming/shooting controls are terrible and lame. The story is sooooooo long. you talk to people more than actually playing the game. You get lame crappy weapons. Theres no reloading just a heat sensor. The reason why is gave 3 stars instead of 2 or 1 is that i bought it for $10 and its not a total waste of time.The graphics are insanely amazing. I would say its better than some games, but is not as good as people say it is. My buddies also say the same thing about this game and how poor it is."
2,Not as fun as people are saying.,"All of the reviews are raving about this game. That's what convinced me to buy it. I kind of regret doing so. I find the story novel and interesting, but the gameplay horrendous. Simply put: it's no fun. Gunfights are boring. The real action is too few and far between. It's funny seeing him jog one minute and then randomly SPIRNT a second later.It's not a great game because the best part of the story. Regardless of how great or original it is, the gameplay must be up there. With this game it isn't."
4,"A good game, but not as good as the hype says.","I have already finished the single player, but not all the side quests. I'm not a big fanboy of RPG's but I have played a few. Mass Effect is a good game by all means, but not all its hyped up to be. Set in a futuristic setting, the story will pull you in and is very interesting. Some of the voice acting was iffy for me though, just not as good as I would like. The story got a bit confusing at some points, but was still good. The action is pretty good, but feels like a toned down version of Gears of War, sometimes a little slow. Overall, if your a fan of RPG's then get this game, but some people might have to look at it more carefully because it is definitely not perfect."
1,... Boring...!,Well I really (really) didn't like Mass Effect - I didn't even go thru half of it as I was so bored and sometimes so frustrated with it * BUT * Mass Effect 2 rocks !!! I love Mass Effect 2. I am so glad I picked up the two games all together because otherwise I would have never given Mass Effect 2 a try. Anyway I understand why some people gave Mass Effect one or two star only: I couldn't believe it until... I played it. But again go and order Mass Effect 2: you won't be disappointed.
1,Awful Follow-Up to KOTOR,"Let me say Knights of the Old Republic is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. The way they meshed turn-based combat with real time was a revelation that no game has since matched. But this game was boring as hell. I played it for over 5 hours, and all it seemed to me was a running simulator with a bad third person shooter mechanic thrown in. Sure, the conversation mechanic was interesting for the first 10 minutes or so, but after a while it was like watching a movie I had to also direct, instead of just enjoying it. Generic sci-fi themes also abounded, lacking the cohesiveness of the Star Wars universe for an underlying premise. I would say Bioware is great at interpreting a story that has already been realized for them, but awful at trying to come up with an original concept, AND executing it in an interesting fashion."
1,"Boring,Boring,and Boring",i have wasted 3 days of my life playing this pointless boring game i do not know what everyone sees in this game i kept playing just thinking it would get better but no it doesnt the graphics are great but the gameplay sucks you just have to stand there during endless talking scenes and when it is over guess what here comes another talking scene you feel like you are playing a movie rather than a video game please rent this game before you buy it i am so glad that i did .thanks for reading
1,"personally, i think this game blows!!","supposedly its the game of the year, ummm really?? you spend hours fighting weak enemies with awkwardly controlled weapons and walk about twenty miles to each mission and the story is really bad, too thats a brief summary. they really hand out those platinum hits title like candy don't they?"
5,very interesting game,"Mass effect is definitely one of the best games ever made. It heavily features a futuristic exploratory atmosphere throughout the entire game. In other words, everything in the game is fictitious and reflects the possibility of humanity achieving that level of technology by then. It is a highly recommended game to any of you shooting game nerds out there."
5,Massively Effective,"This game is absolutely mind blowingly great. First, it actually takes a whole play through to kind of figure things out...making at least one replay a real possibility. Secondly, the story is really, really good. Your decisions actually change the outcome of the game and there are consequences and it is almost never obvious what the right choice is going to be. Sometimes the choice is permanent, too. I tried changing the final out come by replaying the ending and I got my first ending again. That character is locked into that story line for Mass Effect 2.Also let me say the Xbox achievement system is awesome here. Played 20 hours the first time through and only racked up about 500 points. Meaning, I missed stuff :) Sure some of them are replay type of achievements but some of them are not.A great, great game. I'd recommend playing as a female as that actor's voice work is very strong."
3,It's an alright game....,"I'd like to say that this game is an average. The controles are clean and the story is amusing, but aside from that, I just can't rave on it. For me, there is way to much yapping and not enough shooting, and the side missions remind me of old RPGs. On a great price, it's worth picking up, and it shows replay for things you missed the first time around, but definatly IMO not worth full price or gamestore used."
3,Overhyped -- Short,"The big reviews said this was the best game ever. I should have known better.The game is ok, much like any console game in terms of controls and features, but the game is short and too linear. I got to the endgame in a little over 10 hours of play.There are a number of side missions that have no meaning, collecting stuff didn't seem to have much of an effect, nor did experience other than providing more hit points.Maybe I missed too much by following the mission, I don't know.I agree that the story is better than most, but in the end I thought, is this all there is?I'm trying to think of something truly unique and positive to say about this game but nothing seems to come to mind. It was fun, but not enough to merit the high praise it has received.It is an ok game, but very much over-hyped."
5,A MUST BUY!,This is as a superb RPG for the 360 where for once the storyine is every bit as good as the graphics! There are huge areas to explore and it will take you some time to complete so it's really worth the asking price. If you like RPG then you MUST get this game. 10/10
4,Great game,"Great game--took me about 25 hrs to complete. You will enjoy this game if you enjoyed KOTOR on Xbox. This game does have it's flaws: the side missions become very repetitive, vehicle combat is terrible, and the game suffers dramatically from framerate issues at times. While it was a great game, you can't help but feel this game was rushed and could have used a bit more development time to iron out the kinks."
5,Epic Space Opera,"The first of the Mass Effect series, is a ton of fun to play, similar to the Elder Scrolls games in that you can do the main quests in your own time, a large part of this game is optional exploration, and the choices you make.Run straight though to save the universe as we know it, or explore to you hearts content, this game is a ton of fun."
5,One of my favorite 360 games,"As I have gotten about six hours into ME2, I figured I would go back and review the first game. This was by far one my favorite games on 360 so far, and one of the only ones I have bothered to play through a second time. The decision making opportunities throughout the game in terms of dialougue and character and weapon upgrades make this game unique for almost everyone that plays it. I found the story to be quite compelling. It certainly held my interest throughout both playthroughs. It is quite neat to see how decisions in this game have effected the storyline in ME2. Be careful of any decisions you make as they may come back to haunt you!! This is definitely a good crossover game as it includes many FPS and RPG elements blended together."
5,Beginning of the end,"Ever since i bought ME2 for my PS3 last year, i've always wanted to know what happened from the beginning of the story, with the reapers indoctrinating Saren Arteris, Saren and the geth heping the reapers destroy all life in galaxy and so on. And the only thing that i don't like about mass effect, is the citadel council not wanting to do a damn thing about anything"
5,good game,"I absolutely loved the mass effect trilogy. However the first game was my least favorite. The gameplay didn't feel as dynamic as the other two and I spent as much time in the menus as I did playing the game. That being said, I did enjoy the game. The effects it has on the second and third game are important to the story line as well so i seriously recommend buying it."
3,choosing words,"Something different about this game is the character communication -I appreciate the attempt to be unique but it is not all that interesting-and is sort of a waste of shooting time. The options of questions and replys do not seem to have any real interaction with game play.Of particular annoyance is the sniper rifle that is always unsteady, as if the actual rifle is too heavy to lift. Over all the game is OK and reasonably entertaining."
5,A great game,"This is overall one of the best games to have come out in a long time, it successfully combines multiple styles of game play to satisfy everybody. The plot in the game is on par with Hollywood a-list movies, and the replay value is extremely high. You will feel that your actions in the game really have a profound impact on what is happening in the game world, and not just going through the motions like other games. This is one title that unless you have an attention span of a two year old you will enjoy immensely."
2,Disk scratched,"Why is everything that is associated with Microsoft of inferior quality? The disk was scratched before it was even opened for the first time. The game is playable, but it does crash frequently.It's a good RPG."
2,MASS EFFECT IS BORING,"The only good thing about this game is the graphic. It is absolutely beautiful. Other than that, it is extremely boring and slow pace. If you love Knights of The Old Republic, then you'll feel at home. Otherwise you have to get to know all the options, equipments, weapons, different alien races, space ships, characters. If you love FPS, this game is very dissapointing. After giving 2 days to try this game, I decided to return it back to Gamestop."
1,Not so good,"I think he game is not good or interesting, between the 3 games of Mass Effect ... #2 and #3 are much better."
2,In two words,"Pretty boring. Or, pretty but boring. The gameplay is very slow and tedious and isn't very entertaining. Sure, the graphics are nice during cutscenes, but otherwise they're nothing special."
2,if your looking for an rpg as good as kotor dont look here,replay value is nonegameplay is okdialog boringbasicly this game is no where near as good as kotor or kotor 2my advice is wait for this games price to go down
5,Can't Believe I Took So Long to Find This,"I bought this thinking it was a space FPS. I was most certainly wrong and extremely happy to be wrong. I love a game with a good story, Mass Effect has enough story to keep the game moving forward. I also am enjoying the RPG part of this game. When playing rpgs, I am used to assigning point so archery or axes or magic. Using the skill allocation process in a sci-fi story is very neat.Can't wait to get sick of this so I can move on to the next one."
4,Good,A very good game with a lot to do! I enjoyed this game but the whole time it feels somewhat unpolished. Especially when compared to ME2.
5,It's like being in a movie!,"This game is really cool. I wasn't sure what I would think of it when it first arrived from gamefly.com. But, after playing it for a couple of days I can say it's one of the best I've ever played. It is so much like being in a sci fi movie/novel that you really get into it. When I first took command of the Normandy and deliver a speech to the crew I have to admit I was really moved. The visuals are amazing and the entire game is very cinematic. Cut scenes are almost indistinguishable from the regular game play. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game ""experience"" and not just an ordinary game."
4,One of the Greatest Action RPGs,"This is one of the greatest games that have come out this generation. A great mix of RPG and Action/Shooter elements, if you enjoy RPGs you wont be dissapointed at all. It does have a few technical problems, like loading times and slow framerate but the story, gameplay, graphics, design, make up for it. I think the story is one of the most involving sci-fi stories seen in a game lately. And it's getting a sequel which will for sure be much superior to something already great. So if you want to experience Mass Effect 2 to the fullest please play this one first. You wont regret it."
5,fun characters,"I like this fast paced game. I enjoy the multiple choice decisions that the character has during the game. The choices that he makes...really do influence the game. I've been through the game three times, and I've enjoyed it each time.I would highly recommend this game to everyone."
3,It's OK,"This book is ok. Some of the explanations (like with electricity) are a bit confusing, and some of the information in the book is not even tested on the AP exam (like angular momentum). There are a few errors in the answer choices too, and those threw me off. When I studied it, I had no experience with physics whatsoever, and I crammed for the AP Physics B exam in a month and got a 3. But nonetheless I did learn quite a bit, and the introductory chapters that dealt with testing and learning strategies were nice to read. I also found that, as opposed to the Princeton Review's book, theres more verbal explanation of the concepts, rather than a set of problems, making it seem more like a textbook than just a problem workbook.So to a certain extent, the cons balance the pros, making it neither good or bad. I suppose this book is good depending on your learning style. If you want explanations, this book does it. If you more practice problems, princeton does that."
5,A terrific introduction to contemporary worship!,"I'm 32 years old, and I have four kids. This 2-CD set has been a blessing for all of us. We attend a Vineyard church, and a lot of the music is familiar to us because of that. But if you're new to worship music, this is a great selection.I have read that many of these songs are available on other compilations and that there are few new tracks. In my opinion, the songs chosen for this set and the order even is perfect. Again, check the list of tracks before you buy it--in case you get duplicates--but it's a wonderful heart-lifting set to get immersed in the music deidicated to God."
4,Another vote of approval,"I am an avid Christian music collector and bought this collection when it first came out. Yes, it does have a fair number of re-releases but it also does include otherwise unavailable live versions of ""Beautiful One"" by Tim Hughes and ""Holy is the Lord"" by Chris Tomlin which subsequently appeared on their next studio releases in the Fall of 2004. The reason I even read the reviews of a collection I own is that Here I Am To Worship Vol. 2 is scheduled to be released on 1/25/05 and I was looking up which tracks would be included. Overall, if you are looking to build a Christian worship music collection, this is a worthwhile choice along with the I Could Sing of Your Love Forever, WoW Worship and Passion collections."
1,Something nicely bad,It's nice that they decided to recycle old 1950's sci fi props. It's nice of them to pay homage to all those non Hollywoood films that think plots are for losers. It's nice of them to write it like a play with a whole lot of unnecessary dialogue. It's nice of them to ignore science of any type. It's really nice of them to have given some bad actors a chance. It's nice of them to let junior high kids write the story line. It's nice the fooled someone into giving them 2 stars. Yeah.. these guys are just too damn nice to be making movies.
2,It is just cheep. Sci-fi is designed to deliver an idea.,"The original title is ""Terrarium"" (filmed in Las Vegas and surrounding area) watch and you will see why. For impatient a fast forward now and then can not hurt. If you have a Blu-ray player the first level of fast forward will still play the sound and the cheesy background music. If it was not too armature this would be sci-fi. It is worth a quick review.Basic premise a hand full of unlikely astronauts ""misfits"" in various ways are cryogened. Their ship gets damaged and they end up on a mysterious planet. Naturedly the computer is toast so the glass cryogenic cubes will not open. Then they find that they are not alone and that the glass doors will open with enough force from the outside to offer a hairy alien tasty treats. Wait there is more to come."
1,Bring It Back: the money I spent on this trash.,"Team Boo was disjointed and aloof and the ""hooks"" were juvenile.Nothing has changed on this new album. More of the same, but less so. The ""harmonies"" don't quite gel. The songwriting is subpar.Indie Rock at it's worst.BTW- Isn't the guy on the cover wearing her make-up?!Freaky.."
5,WONDERFUL CD of Peggy Lee,"I too heard ""Sweet Happy Life"" on the Target commercial (#20 on this CD) and HAD to find out who the singer was. After discovering it was Peggy Lee and ordering Pretty Eyes/Guitars a la Lee I am now HOOKED! Sweet Happy Life is a great song, but the remainder of the entire album is Peggy Lee at her BEST! I highly recommend this CD. I am a fan for life. I can't stop playing it!"
5,LIBERATION FROM SELF,"Erudite, fascinating look at difficult topic. Berofsky captures all the complex elements of this tough philosophical treatise. Excellent scholarship, its easy-going style helps even the lay person to understand even its most difficult ideas."
4,Bookmarks review,I am using Bookmarks as a college textbook. I am finding it very informative. This book helps in understanding the process of writing a research paper.
4,Great writing aid,This book was required for a writing class that I was enrolled in. It is an excellent writing aid when the writing will be viewed by the public.
3,How to quote and cite correctly,"A decent textbook to learn how to write references and use APA format as well as MLA and CMS for quotations.Now the question is does it worth $40+...I don't think so!Personally, I found it more useful to refer to these 2 websites: apa.org and bibme.org."
5,Good reference to have on hand when needed.,This book is as good as Diane Hackers when it come to helping you with Research and Writing your paper. It is very informative. I like it.
3,Ukrainian Course Review,"There are so few courses in Ukrainian.Pro:- One of a few courses out there- Seems like a comprehensive course, if you get through itCon:- Hard for me to follow at the beginning and that's where I've stayed with my progress in this course. It immediately jumps into words and phrases without spending much time on basic linguistics like sounds, alphabet, word construction, logic and thought process. Logic and thought process are very important in understanding any language.I contacted Rosetta Stone and they unfortunately have no current plans to teach this language."
3,"Good book,,, Not so great CDs...","I bought this book when I was an exchange student in Ukraine... I did not have any previous experience with the language. I found the book to be immensely helpful, but gave up on the cds. I found the reader spoke too quickly to comprehend, I couldn't keep up. Just so you know, another exchange student (to Czech Republic) had the same problem with the Czech cds. Otherwise, a good (although your only) choice."
2,Not what I expected,"This book had really great reviews. However, the cds do not always match up to the text in the book. Found it frustrating to use, sometimes hard to follow and sometimes they speak way too fast on the cd to hear the proper pronunciation."
3,trying to please Grandma,I wouldn't suggest this if this is your first stab at any sort of russian block language. It's not exactly user friendly unless you have a teacher handy.This would be good if finding yourself further down the road in the language itself. But to become comfortable with the language first would help and this is a bit daunting.
4,king,"excellent, like any new language you will have a lot of dificulties, but give it enough time and repeate a lot and you will have it."
5,Simply lovely,The lost princess of oz is written with a beauty and innocence of a child with merry quirks and is a perfect story about a heroine who can fight some of her own battles and empty we all can learn from
4,Nephew loves it,"My 11 year old nephew has been reading the series of the 14 books and anxiously awaits the arrival of the next. He says ""I can't believe that these were written about 100 years ago"". The Books of Wonder series contains the original illustrations."
2,Do not like,"i bought this salt & pepper mill from walmart, its very hard to turn cause its square, it does not hold much salt. i will never buy a salt & pepper mill like this ever again & there is no where to refill the pepper."
3,Badmarsh & Shri - Dancing Drums,"Badmarsh & Shri were part of the wave of Indian-influenced electronic music that swept the late 90s. On their debut, DANCING DRUMS, you can hear the tablas forming part of the breakbeats. The title track, for example, takes a quick bass and blends it into the percussion, fusing the two smoothly, even as the sitar starts rocking out. ""The Asian Detective"" is more mellow, with a healthy dose of Delhi noir. The bass on ""Gharana"" is quite something, while ""130 Steps"" has the rat-a-tat rhythmic chanting. Oddly enough, their attempt at pop with ""The Air I Breathe"" isn't as compelling as the strings on ""Lament."" Good overall, though it doesn't do enough to distinguish itself."
2,nice beats but too boring,what drives me crazy is the music being looped over and over.. good beats if ur into drum and bass.
2,Could have been a great CD,"It's too bad that this composition is overwhelmed by an overbearing, unimaginative, tired drum loop that completely drowns out an otherwise decent jam of Indian music."
2,Pretty good background music,"Pretty good CD for background music, but some of the bass lines are a little cheesy."
3,Not recommended,"The shorts are made of a great, super shiny fabric and are sewn well. The problem with these shorts is the fit. It's off. The pattern cut is wrong, so when lifting one of the legs, as in climbing the stairs or kicking a ball the shorts constrict the movement. Normaly I wear size medium and thinking that maybe the sizes run small I returned 3 of them and ordered 3 large. So now I have large shorts with the same problem. It is as true for shorts as it is for a suit ....the fit is everything!"
4,Nice potted summary of German senior officers,I like this book as it gives a nice summary of the top German senior officers in Kaiser's army. This is helped by the delightful drawings of Patrice Courcelle.
1,not what I ordered,"I can't make a comment, because I did not receive the jacket ordered--they sent me a AMC or something with that initial and it was not what I wanted so sent it back. I hope this is not your practice of sending ""something similar"" because I will not purchase anything from you if this is the practice."
5,Sadness,I have been turning people on to this album since 92. Probably sold hundreds myself. I checked from time to time for a follow-up. Figures something terrible would have to happen to stop this fantastic musician. Each time I listen I think of being 18 again. I guess we both stopped in time. Buy this and give it to someone. They will love you for it.
5,Music that moved me to tears,"I bought this CD in 1992 and waited patiently for more albums from Ephraim Lewis. The driving melodies and meaningful, insightful, sad lyrics have made this one of my most favorite albums. This CD came out at the time SEAL was becoming popular and I never understood why Ephraim Lewis did not rise to the same fame as SEAL. After reading the review written by the reviewer in June 1998, I now know why. I would like to know what happened to Lewis...."
1,very boring,i didn't get Ephraim Lewis then or now.he was to me a 3rd tier Terence trent D'arby clone or a 2nd tier Seal.the words&Music have been done all before by better talent.
4,"Makes you wonder ""what if...""","Though it runs a bit out of steam toward the end, this is a sultry and moody blend of R&B and light jazz. Were it not for Lewis' death a few years ago, it would stand as a promising first album from which he could have developed in several interesting areas. Instead it stands as the artist's entire body of work. That's a shame because he shows so much potential here, but ""Skin"" is still enjoyable in itself."
5,An Underrated Gem,"I heard ""Drowning In Your Eyes"" several times on my favorite smooth jazz station and wondered who this guy was with his incredible velvet voice. Googled him, discovered his died in 1994 and only recorded one CD. I got on Rhapsody and found Ephraim Lewis and his album, Skin. ""Drowning In Your Eyes"" is only one of the many nuggets on this beautifully recorded album. Ephraim's voice and music kinda reminds me of Seal with a twist of Sade, just the kind of smooth jazz vocals I love to listen to. Who knows where his talent would have taken him had he lived? If you're a smooth jazz fan (although they packaged this CD as R&B), you will like every track on this CD. Close your eyes, sit back and drown in the smooth ripples of Ephraim's voice. You won't be disappointed."
3,It's Pretty Good,"I too bought this for ""Drowning in your Eyes"", but after repeated listenings, I found myself singing with other cuts. ""I really like ""World Between Us"" and my favorite is ""Hold On"". I guess Seal is close to the TYPE of music he sang, but his voice is slightly different. It's great listening music, kind of mid tempo, you can't really boogie to it, but it's also good driving music. I wish there were a couple more songs on it, since we won't be getting anything new from him. ""It Can't Be Forever"" is kind of spooky and haunting, and different from the other cuts. I recommend this CD, but know that it's not your typical R&B. I recommend listing to the snippits before you buy it. Because after repeated listening, I must say, it really grew on me. I know it doesn't sound like it, but I recommend it!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I first became interested in Ephraim Lewis because I had heard ""Drowning in Your Eyes"" and loved it. I looked for the CD and read the reviews found here. I feel that Lewis falls more into the Marvin Gaye or Smokey Robinson category than that of Seal. I am a major Seal fan and still find him way more innovative and captivating than Lewis. Although I do enjoy this collection of songs, I feel that they comprise a mediocre effort. With the exception of ""Drowning In Your Eyes"", there is nothing on this CD that can compare to the mood makers created by Seal such as ""Violet"" or ""Song for the Dying""."
4,Very good tool for beginning German!,"Quite simple and easy to get started, I spent two 3 yr tours in Germany, loved the country, loved the people and FOOD!!!My daughter was taking German ins school, but the class she transferred into was too advanced for her so I bought these. She learned basic sentence structure and common words - a bib help in her class."
1,Not Worth the Money,1. The CD is not by the Department of Defense so that endorsement should be removed.2. The CD contains information easily found on the web.3. Don't waste your money. The CD isn't worth it.
1,"Yet another ""VB6"" ripoff!","Arrgh! When is an ethical author going to actually describe the very significant new Web-related features of VB6 rather than doing a sloppy and minimal update of VB5 info? This book and Carl Franklin's effort are absolute ripoffs that do not deserve to be rewarded with your money! Instead, save it and reward the author(s) who will hopefully provide the first real publication that deals with DHTML, WebClasses, and the other pieces that distinguish VB6 from it's past versions. Please!!"
1,Check out Wayne S. Freeze's hands on SQL 7 with VB6 book,"Check out Wayne S. Freeze's hands on SQL Server 7 with VB6 book. It covers pretty well on ASP, WebClasses, and DHTML, Pluse excellent example of how to get SQL Server and VB together"
2,Focus on DHTML too MUCH !,"This book talks lots of basic content about internet ! If you want to write internet applications , you should learn the use of DHTML and ASP, which I think is the most important. However, this book focuses on the use of DHTML within Visual Basic 6. I think it's better to reference other books containing the use of WebClass within VB6 after you read this book."
5,"Very interesting, Fast Paced",This book has tought me exactly what was needed to put together my VBDevNet.com web site... Web Classes were especially good and fast paced !I would recommend it to all of my customers !
1,"Save your money, don't buy this book!","This book covers a wide range of topics but the author never explains his code. The book shows you how to wite a search engine program, the program is several pages long. But the author never explains his logic or how the program works."
1,Don't waste your money,I had some doubts about ordering this movie. Don't bother! I frquently get movies with no social redemning value but this doesn't even fit that criteria. The color is horrible and faded and the sound is so bad that it is nearly unwatchable. .
4,The long awaited album is finally here!,"Jason LeVasseur and Jerry Chapman provide a refreshing change to todays musical scene. They write there own songs and play their own instruments, take that Backstreet Boys! The new album blends together seamlessly the contrasting musical styles of LaVasseur and Chapman. Though only two, the sound is that of a full band. Having toured together for years, the new album is tight and feels as if they are singing live for you. The songwriting is intimate and heartfelt. ""Big Sky"" is magical, ""Hopscotch in Oz"" highlights Chapman's strong voice, ""Spacegirl"" is hard to get out of your head, and the rest of the album does not disappoint. Don't just buy the CD, make sure that you catch them live the next time they are in your town. They are a fun act live, and this album catches that energy."
2,Bland Bat,"This book was disappointing. Bland, flacid, superficial ... pointless, except for the Bat-neophyte. You'd have to know next to nothing about Batman to appreciate this book. It breaks no new ground, presents mediocre archive art in a boring way, and is a basic waste of money."
5,Answered a lot of my questions,"I bought this book because I am new to the Batman world and I wanted to know about the people around him and his most famous adversaries. The graphics in the book are great. If you are looking for a primer on the major players in the Batman world (friends and foes), then this book is for you."
2,Not enough.,"Taught me a lot about Penguin and a few others, and gave great ideas for movies, but not enough. Not enough."
4,A DIFFERENT APPROACH,"Swing Out Sister has been my favorite musical group for a long time. I always find their music easy to listen to and in most cases fun. Most of the songs are for those are for the hopeless romantics. This is still the same for FILTH & DREAMS. However...I do agree with the other reviewers that they have taken a different approach to their music. I would have to aggree that it is slightly hip-hop but more r&b; laden music. There is still the general feeling of old SOS (MAKE YOU STAY, CLOSER THAN THE SUN & FILTH AND DREAMS). However they did shy away from the jazzy and uptempo feel that we SOS fans are use to. Songs like WORLD OUT OF CONTROL, INVISIBLE & SUGAR FREE still contain Corinne's beautiful voice but tend to aim in the direction of r&b; and hip-hop.Overall this is a decent cd to own. Most people will not give this cd a chance but die hard fans (like myself) will have to have it. It is still as good and versitile as the other cds throughout their career."
4,Swing Out Sister makes hip-hop for adults,"OVERVIEW: The British pop group responsible for ""Breakout,"" ""Waiting Game,"" and ""Circulate"" reemerge with the most mature collection of pop-oriented hip-hop we've seen in years. Expertly melding their psychedelic affections with sampled beats from the future, ""Filth and Dreams"" is an adult pop fan's dream come true.AT ITS BEST: ""Who's Been Sleeping,"" ""Sugar Free,"" and ""Happy When You're High"" represent everything that modern pop could be if only radio and MTV would allow it. Astrud Gilberto meets Howie B? It's even better than it sounds.AT ITS WORST: The ballad ""If I Had the Heart"" and the hip-hop folk of ""Invisible"" hardly offend, but probably won't make anyone's list of essential listens, either.BOTTOM LINE: Fans of jazz, soul, and mature pop can unite in ""Filth and Dreams."""
4,Pain & Tears,"Wow, gritty street-level woe finally visits the Norman Vincent-Peal of Popsters! Listening to ""Invisible"" and ""If I had the Heart"" is about as exitential as it gets. A real wallow in real-life concerns and mid-life crisises wrapped up in sublime strings and lullaby vocals. Goodnight, Baby Boomers."
3,Cool retro adult contemporary,"This is a smooth airy sound which could've been warmed up with horns. The arrangements are sparse, synthetic and very lightly performed. My favorites are track two, a fabulous Vince Gauraldi piano sound with heavenly vocals. Also, track 8, the most emotion expressed by the vocalist of any cut on the CD. A good CD by a serious group of artists, but not as much fun as Their last few albums."
4,Unusuall Experimentation of the Swings but worths to listen,"A rare release from Swing Out Sister , Japanese edition full of electronic beats and rithms , far away from their traditional Jazz, Bossanova and Soul offers we are used to listen but this is a unique gem in their awesome discography , and for this reason it has its own value, its good , very goodHM"
4,Another gem for your SOS collection,"Although not as good as ""Shapes and Patterns"", ""Filth and Dreams"" is certainly a great addition to your SOS collection. Corrinne's vocals might lull you into a blue mood, but there's enough spice in the album to keep you listening."
3,A different kind of fresh sounds,Swing out Sister has done it again. If you want something jazzy and different you have to give this CD a try you won't regret it!
2,I am really disappointed,"I truly hate giving this recording a negative review, but this CD is pretty disappointing. Swing Out Sister is so brilliant so often, but with this recording they seem to have just thrown together some second-rate songs and then forgot to finish the recording process. The vocals are muffled, the songs make little sense (""You'll always find a friend, there's a cure for everything, meet me when tomorrow comes, life could be wonderful"" HUH? ), and the style is neither pop nor jazz nor alternative. I really love SOS, and I hope this is a one-time mistake."
3,'m with the band.,"Good arrangements overall. The sidemen are all capable, and know how to swing as one. If there are any weaknesses, they lie with the vocals, but this doesn't take away from the solid sound that the group produces."
1,Don't waste your time,"This story was tedious and formulaic. While the reader is supposed to feel compassion for the main character, all you feel is disdain at her weakness and fraility. I felt more annoyed than anything else. I wasn't even able to get past a chapter or two. Don't bother with this one."
3,Buy with caution,"This book is good, to a point. It is an enjoyable read, but there are little things that will get on your nerves more and more as the book progresses. The character in the story faints alot. And I mean ALOT. And the husband seems to just take it all with a grain of salt. This is what became a little annoying. If someone you love is fainting nearly twice a day almost every day, you don't just say ""Honey are you O.K.?"" Other than that, this book was fun to read. I did find myself just wanting to get it over with at the end though."
4,a good late-summer read,"I found this book to be a good way to spend a lazy afternoon. The heroine could have been stronger and more ""heroic"" and the relationships between the characters better developed, but the story is nicely paced and has a gruesome but satisfying ending. The premise is harrowing, especially if you're a parent. I am looking forward to Matthews' next book."
1,What's a dead girl got to be scared of?,"The ""heroine"" of this story was pretty unlikable. Nothing in the world seemed to make her happy or please her; therefore, it was impossible to empathize with her. She seemed to enjoy her misery in the loss of a baby years earlier and feeling that her husband and everyone else in the world didn't understand her grief. Get therapy, for goodness sake! Her husband was a wimp and his brother, of course, detestable. I also don't understand the reasoning behind the fear of a little dead girl that someone is going to harm her. How can you hurt a dead person? Don't waste your money on this exceedingly disappointing novel."
5,One of My Favorites!,"""The White Room"" is an amazing mystery and thrillers/horror book. I absolutely loved reading it! The ending is unbelieveable, and the book had me hooked until the end. He better write more books because I am sure going to buy more from him. If you like mystery and suspense with a little bit of a scary edge, I definitely recommend this book to you. This book is one of my favorites. You will be totally swept off your feet when you read the end. I am adding this book to my favorites list. Buy this book, it is awesome, and the first sentence will hook you till the last."
1,Disappointing,When I purchased this book last weekend I checked out Amazon.com for the reviews and ouch! Four out five reviews said this book was bad but I thought I paid my money and started reading anyway. By about page 70 I was ready to chuck it in the trash..The main charactor seems most of the time crying or fainting which makes for very tedious reading. Best avoid this one.
2,Are we through yet?,This book could have been good but it was irritating the way the main character couldn't handle any situation. Also I don't think the narration was believable. It didn't make sense like when she got scared and was leaving her son not knowing what's going on. I flipped throught some of the pages it was so repetitive and boring. The ending to me was predictable and I didn't care at all about the little girl's part in the story. It would have been better totally left out. Not worth my time.
1,Don't read it,"I think this book is horrible. No wonder it's not on the Bestseller List. The main character is fragile, fainting every five seconds, the relationship between man and wife is unloving, and I can't believe that even once at the end Polly is not thinking of her son that she thinks is caught in the fire, but thinking that she wants Rob to die. If my son was caught in a burning house, i'd go save him, even trying to die. The plot is poor. Don't waste your money."
4,Kornstein's approach is original and relevant.,"Though perhaps defensive about his title and possibly a little hard on Portia, Kornstein, in true attorney style, effectively demonstrates Shakespeare's interest in and knowledge of legal problems that still are of concern today. He makes the reader aware of Shakespeare's multi-faceted view of human nature--a characteristic easily overlooked in a superficial encounter. Weakest is his theory concerning Midsummer Night's Dream, strongest is his concluding chapter with its brilliant appreciation of Shakespeare. This is an author worth knowing, a book worth reading. --Margaret Demores"
5,Amazing,"I have never had alergies, etc but last spring I started waking with headaches, and runny nose...took some other over the counter medications and they worked but had dry throat, etc. A friend suggested this product because it was natural and that was all she could take. Have taken it ever since and have virtually no problems with allergies. Dr. was impressed when I told her and said she would suggest to other patients."
4,Just before Weather Report...,"Just as Wayne, Miroslav Vitous, and Joe Zawinul were about to become Weather Report (Alphonse Mouzon and Airto Moriera were the other founding members) each had a solo album hit the streets. Of the three (""Iska"", Vitous' ""infinite Search"" and ""Zawinul"") the most remarkable was Vitous' debut, but it was truly a landmark of fusion.""Iska"" has never been as popular, and has been only sporadically available on vinyl and CD. The ""spacey"" first three cuts (the vinyl's first side) lose focus sometimes, but are interesting explorations of color and texture that characterized some of Miles' studio work at the time.The closing ""Joy"" is another fusion landmark, though; the two-bass two-drummer rhythm section puts the hammer down, and part way through, Wayne switches from tenor back to soprano and tears several new windows in his listeners' heads.BTW, Leonard Feather's original liner notes refered to the new supergroup-to-come as ""Weather FORECAST""!.RFGS"
3,GOOD BOOK,It is a good book which contains a lot of questions made by ETS. The number of questions is near 400. But there aren't any detailed answers in it. You should not buy the copy unless you are smart enough to solve all of these by yourself.
1,Outdated,"Some one suggested me to buy this book for Subject Maths GRE. But as far as I know, this books has problems no way near to the original test, REA will be lot better to this."
4,ETS GRE Engineering,The Book really helped me time myself and gave me a good basic idea of the test and greatly helped boost confidence.!!..really good book to have if u want to give the any engineering test.!

5,Position play in 3 cushion billiards,"An excellent book for the player who already knows the basics of the game. It enables him to perform excellent shots and make high runs. When you first look at the book you feel you already knew, the shots had to be played in the way shown. Unfortunately you realise that if you never had the chance to read this book you would not think about it during the game. Eddie Robin clearly demonstrates his skill not only as a player but also as a great instructor. Probably the most important book for anyone who takes three cushion billiards seriously"
5,High quality with good price,"Very satisfy with for the purchase. Efficient customer service, fast shipping as promised. They have very good price and high quality compatible ink, which is good value to print. Highly recommended this seller, and will buy from them again."
5,Most Outstanding Delivery Time,The merchant shipped this item right away after I ordred it and I recieved it on the second day. I will order this item again and agian. Thanks.
5,Excellent product!,"I purchased this tank along with the combo pack of colors when they were almost empty. I replaced them after using the original ones with my MP600, for almost 8 months. I have not had to use this tank yet! I still have 1/4 tank left of the original one which came with the machine! I think that is awesome!!"
4,Good things don't last and this is no exception.,"I have owned three types of printers and bought two of the Canon MP that I have now. The printer is great. The ink runs out fast and is too expensive. What can I do? Give up my printer? Never! I caan print about 250 sheets before my number 5 inker runs out. I print a great deal and use lot of ink. If you are interested in a good printer, buy one like mine. If you can't stand the short term inkers, look elsewhere. I have only one complaint about this ink--it runs out very fast and is not that cheap."
5,Good product,I like the ease of installation of this ink cartridge and it's a lot cheaper than the HP printer ink I used to have to buy.
2,expensive and doens't last long,I wish printer manufactuers would just charge a realistic price for their printers rather than always trying to kill us on the price of the ink. It's often cheaper to throw away a printer and buy a new one than to get replacement ink for it. This stuff seems to last about 50 pages before it goes dry.
3,"OK, doesn't last too long","The product is ok, but does not last long enough to justify the price. I'd say that you should go with a different printer if you are concerned with cost and you use the printer constantly, because you may shell out $1000 per year on the ink if you are not careful. DO NOT use this ink for multiple copies, as the ink will only last 1 day. Wish I had known this before going with the Canon printer that takes the ink jets, but I didn't. Now you do, though...Also, don't print out photos with this, as the ink will not last 1 day in that scenario. Just buy a different printer after doing a good amount of research, because I don't want you to lose all of your hard-earned money on printing documents!"
3,"Good lifespan, could be more durable","I have no complaints about how long the ink last or the actual text quality. My main beef is the ink is not waterproof. I can't use a highlighter on documents printed on my Canon MP500. I seem to remember being able to do this on my old HP DeskWriter (the original, over 10 years old). If there is another Canon ink number compatable with my printer that can be highlighted I'd sure like to know."
3,DID NOT ARRIVE IN TIME,"I WAS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT ON A FRIDAY IF I KNEW I WAS NOT GOING TO GET THIS PRODUCT IN TWO DAYS LIKE I REQUESTED I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT I NEEDED IT FOR WORK OVER THE WEEKEND AND DID NOT RECEIVE IT UNTIL MONDAY WHICH WAS NO GOOD TO ME, I HAD TO GO BUY INK FROM A OFFICE SUPPLY STORE AND SPEND MORE MONEY SO I CAN GET MY WORK DONE. THE PRODUCT IS THE SAME NOTHING WRONG BUT THE SHIPPING WAS HORRIBLE WHEN I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE HERE ON TIME FOR WORK REASONS. I WILL NOT PURCHASE THESE ITEMS FROM HERE NO MORE AND WILL GO TO AN LOCAL OFFICE SUPPLY STORE TO PURCHASE IT."
2,Love the machine hate the cartridges,I agree with the other reviewer. I have the MP500 and this is a very nice all in one scan/print/copy no fax machine. However be prepared to shell out some bucks for the PGI-5. I am going thru about 1 every 3 weeks at a cost of about 15 bucks on very lite print jobs. I always use the fast print option. There is no compatible as of yet. I went thru Office Depot where I paid $15 per but got free shipping on orders of $50 or more. I might have to bring back my Epson for my black ink print jobs. The other four cartridges are wearing very well. This is the last printer I will ever buy that doesn't already have a compatible on the market. I am looking into refilling this cartridge with an ink kit however you have to disable the ink gauge on the printer.
2,Faulty Cartridge,"This is probably the fifth cartridge I have replaced and the only one not to work perfectly.This one would produce good quality single pages but incomplete printing of multi-page documents.Amazon was quick to send a replacement after I contacted them but, sent the wrong cartridge."
3,Be very careful!,"Amazon's cartridge finder lists this cartridge for the Canon PIXMA MX-7600, but it DOES NOT FIT. You want the PGI-7BK cartridge, not the PGI-5BK. Amazon lists the 7 as well as the 5, but it lists the 5 first. I'm sure this cartridge is fine if you have a printer it fits, but if you have a 7600 and you trust Amazon, it can get really frustrating.Word to the wise."
3,It needs to be edited,There are many typos in this book and when dealing with very technical issues it is very important to have a reference which is correct.
2,Kinda' dull,"For such an interesting man living in such turbulent times as the '20s and '30s in Chicago, this was kinda' dull. Reitman's daughter disects many letters to & from Reitman but really doesn't get into an indepth study of the man--or the times. It's basically just a superficial gloss-over of his many lovers (and there were a lot!)The author could have used a better editor--she jumps around quite a bit, making statements that aren't followed up.I kept wondering what drove him to do the things he did--and how he became involved in his diverse causes. You'll never know by reading this book.Too bad--he could be a very interesting subject that sheds light on a controversial political and social movement in this country."
5,One of the only places that still sells wanka chewy gobstoppers!,Shipping wasn't the fastest in the world but it was right around christmas time so I can't really complain. I would definitly do business again!
4,So smooth!,"I've enjoyed seeing and hearing Scott Joss play fiddle and sing back up with Merle Haggard when he tours. Scott is an awesome fiddle player! He also has a beautifully smooth yet simple voice that makes you want to hear more. This collection of songs includes some really mellow sounds. I especially like Lonely Sounds and Rose In The Shadow. I also like his cover of You're The Reason. When you listen to Scott, you almost feel like he's sitting right next to you, singing just to you!"
4,This is a nice book for all working people.,"I received this book from U.S. and decided to translate it to my language (Farsi). I think it's a nice book for all working people and it should be bought by all the employers, in order to use by all the workers and employees and even the employers. It gives a sense of freedom and relaxation to all of us (who are working with somebody else.) I would like to thank Dr. Carlson for his nice book. (SORRY FOR MAKING MISTAKE IN GRAMMER AND DICTATION). SOHEILA M.RAZAVI"
5,Great gift for a coworker,"I flipped through this before I gave it to my coworker. I loved it, and I knew she would, too! So inspirational."
4,Simple Advice,"Some of the ""advice"" is a good, although it is presented in a very simplistic way. I guess the author wanted all audiences to understand the meaning.Some of the advice is redundant, other is good.I purchased this for myself to if I can learn how to reduce some of the stress at work, but now we are using it in the office.I have to say that the chapters that really pertain to you get you a bit upset. (truth hurts I guess). I found that applies to more people than just me when we started reading in the office. :-)If you are looking for a brake-through book this is not it. If you are looking for some simple self-improvement advice as it pertains to the work environment, you may find some guidance in here. Don't read too much or expect too much from this book. Although it is somewhat helpful if you accept it for what it is."
3,"Not very deep, nor very helpful","This book would have worked much better as a wall poster or forwarded email: ""150 Ways to Lighten Up at Work"" or something like that. It's like a really, really dumbed-down, touchy-feely version of Baltasar Gracian's ""The Art of Worldy Wisdom,"" and just made me realize I should re-read that book instead. (No offense meant to Gracian!)Each chapter is skimmable in 30 seconds or less, and far too many chapters offer mediocre advice that makes you question whether the author has worked in a typical modern office in the past twenty years, instead of making you feel like you just received a fresh perspective on an old problem.If the positive reviews for this book have left you thinking maybe it's worth a read, I strongly recommend you browse through it at a bookstore first. It's so lightly written that most people can scan it in 7-10 minutes at a store and save $12.Books like these are what make me distrust self-help gurus and think that they're all con artists."
1,Book,The book was sold as great condition and it was not even in fair condition. Book was stained and old.Shipped from Florida
3,A few nice snippets on how to minimize stress at work,"Dr. Carlson's book provides some keen insights on how to reduce stress when employeed by a large corporation, or for those shackled to a cubicle for eight hours at a go. While helpful overall, the book is less beneficial to those employeed in the retail sector or other public service areas, where dealing with cranky customers and unmotivated staff seems to be the prevailing problems."
2,Too Focused on an Office Enviroment,"I've enjoyed the other Don't Sweat the Small Stuff Books and thought this book would be helpful in helping me to reduce some of my stress at work. I find that almost all of the suggestions assume an office type of atmosphere and aren't really well suited to my work enviroment - a high paced retail enviroment. Making use of break times is nice if you get breaks, i.e. I just found the book sort of narrowly targeted to a certain type of worker."
4,This is amazing useful book for everyone in business !,"Dr Carlson's Don't Sweat the Small Stuff... is an amazing book. It's written just for me ! After reading the 10 first pages I had found myself on each several times. The text is so simple that everybody must inderstand it. Even me ! This book is the modern way to say that ""Nothing but taking care of a garden is necessary and even thet is not necessary"". Thank you Dr Carlson ."
5,Contunuing relevance of Aron's classic,"Although Aron's treatise was published many decades ago as a brilliant and unsurpassed analysis of French intellectual culture, it has direct relevance for contemporary fads and foibles of Western cultural and intellectual life. Much of what goes on in the academy today becomes lucid when read within Aron's analytical framework. This book should be read by all who care about the education of their children."
5,Upbeat and Enjoyable,"I've heard bits & pieces of several Sanborn albums in the past & must admit I never cared much for his music. So, I was totally unprepared for the thoroughly upbeat & enjoyable music I heard on this cd. With great playing & arrangements by Marcus Miller, funky B-3 backing by Ricky Peterson, a tight horn section featuring Randy Brecker & even a nice solo by Eric Clapton on one song, a five star rating was a no-brainer. There are lots of blues, funky grooves, brass & extended solos with Sanborn ""Upfront"" on most of the selections while still allowing time for the supporting cast to showcase their talents. As for negatives, I have to side with the anti Bang Bang group. It's not that I dislike the song, it just doesn't seem to fit. Another minor criticism - I have been unable to find the times of each song listed anywhere on the cd. Overall - a very impressive effort."
4,Track Listing,1.Snakes 7:302.Benny 5:463.Crossfire 5:354.Full House 6:545.Soul Serenade 4:126.Hey 8:277.Bang Bang 4:378.Alcazar 7:299.Ramblin' 8:01An above-average effort from the highly influential alto saxophone player.
5,"EASILY Dave's funkiest, and grittiest","The grooves on this disc still sound deep to me, sixteen years later. I've been a fan of Sanborn's since ""As We Speak,"" went back to the earlier stuff, and saw him twice during his 80's heyday. Marcus M's brilliant stroke of bringing in Ricky Peterson and his B-3 helped make this Sanborn's ""escape"" from the world that he accidentally created: Smooth Jazz. I just listened to clips from ""Here and Gone,"" and it sounds like Dave may have begun yet another ""hot streak"" - I hope so."
2,Lukewarm fusion....,"You would have thought, with a list of brass credits this big, that the music on this album would have more intensity, but aside from 'Alcazar', which is beautiful, the horn section sounds, well, cold and mechanical. It doesn't sound like a seasoned group of musicians, but rather like a CD where each track was put together in the studio (those redundant guitar lines on 'Snakes' are a great example). This includes a section of horns that sound like they were were sampled electronically and added around Sanborn's solo sax. Try Tower of Power for some really emotive brass section work."
3,Mildly spiced,"I guess this would be considered hard smooth jazz, a bit of an oxymoron. Some of the compositions paired with Sanborn's diverse approach are engaging enough, but just about everything is caked in geezer-jam production which does the opposite of convey raw collision."
3,Hmmmmmm.......,"Nothing wrong with Sanborn`s playing here (great as usual) . A few good tracks, but most are forgettable. (after the first 4) What`s up with ""Bang Bang"" ? ..ugh....more like Bong Bong."
2,Not up to Ppar,"I am a HUGE fan of Moench and Jones. The pairing of these two is usually magical in ever sense of the word. The Batman/Dracula trilogy is some of the best Batman I've seen in years, but I think the pair really misstepped here. Even Jones, who was born to draw Batman, seems off this time, and the story fails to entertain at at all. If you are looking for Batman by these two pick up the aforementioned trilogy or the FAR superior Batman Unseen."
4,this book is great!!!! : ),THE CRY OF THE CROW is a great book.I like the book because it was interesting and shows how crows can imitate people. It is about a girl named Mandy and she has a crow and keeps it for along time but at the end something happens to the crowso Mandy doesnt see it any more. I woul give THE CRY OF THE CROW a high rating!
3,The Harrad Experiment,"""The Harrad Experiment"", I saw this when it first was released after reading the book everyone was reading. The movie is what I remember; sexploytation but done main stream. It is too bad the transfer is so poor; it is less than VHS quality. A very young Don Johnson, Bruno Kirby and others are fun to watch."
3,Flashback,"I read the Harrad book a looong time ago and finally got to see the movie. Though I don't remember the details I do think the movie captured the spirit of the book and it was fun having a 70's flashback. I think the story line was a lot shorter then what was covered in the book though. I watched it straight through with no thoughts of shutting it off and finding something better to do so it did hold my interest. As for the seller and quality, I got the movie 2 days after ordering (amazing) and though not up to todays standards, the picture quality was good enough that I wasn't distracted by it being an overly ""bad"" picture. (if you know what I mean) Haven't watched ""Love All Summer"" yet. Someday soon I guess."
3,"This ""experiment"" belongs to the science fiction genre!","I saw ""The Harrad Experiment"" when it first came out and I was a university student myself. Even then, it was impossible to imagine a college or university administration recruiting male and female students to shack up together in a dorm as sort of ""experiment!"" If you are willing to categorize this ""experiment"" as part of science, then this movie might be considered part of the science fiction genre! The acting is good. The interactions between the students are not too hard to believe, if you are willing to accept the premise. Still, something is clearly missing. Perhaps if Mel Brooks had directed this as a comedy with Gene Wilder as the professor conducting the experiment (a la ""Young Frankenstein"") this movie would have been amazing!By the way, it is my understanding that ""Harrad"" is contraction formed from the names of the brother and sister institutions Harvard and Radcliffe."
4,Exploring your sexual freedom!,"A good 70's exploitative film! Double feature! lots of casual nudity, Both films have some sexual situations but mostly nude not lewd...Features Don Johnson full frontal teen (over 18) nudity, before he was a celebrity, also has skinny dipping.Co-eds are paired up as roommates and quickly take on couple attributes, even if they are not dating, the professor sets up situations to test how free the students are with their free love, and expose that even worldly students have some jealous tendencies.I saw this in a drive-in in the 70's, so getting a copy was nostalgic for me. It is not one of my favorite films, but a fun, nude filled film that I would buy again..."
5,The Cat Man Cometh.,"The phrase is apt because the narrator author has had more lives than the black cat and has seen more than the usual man's share of danger. And he appears to have had all the moves just like the legendary Catwoman.Starting out as a common soldier in the Bolshevik Army of 1918, he went on to survive the Spanish Civil War, the Stalin purges, and partisan operations in WW II behind the German lines.This is a fascination memoir and well deserves a place in the collection of the Special Ops aficianado or in the collection of the adventure novel reader. Well worth having."
5,Start here and keep on phishin',"This album was my first exposure to Phish-- all it took was the opening measure of ""The Mango Song"" and I was hooked. It takes about 30 seconds to note the imagery in this music. Listen to ""The Landlady""-- do you see her, tapping her foot in her small apartment kitchen, guzzling coffee, curlers in her hair, pink terrycloth bathrobe, reaching for a cigarette as she pets her chihuahua? It's all there. My first live Phish was my senior prom, where some kids played a cover of ""Llama"". Every time I hear that song I picture myself shaking a serious tail feather and laughing at myself Phishing in a white dress with my best pals, watching my date (the Prom King) sit around and feel nervous, claiming he ""couldn't dance to this stuff-- it has no beat"". Well kids, it only gets better from there. Phish speaks to your soul. Forget finding a beat, just let this music take you for a ride, and you will never look for love again."
3,not quite a winner...,"A lot of people and critics call this the best Phish studio album, but I think it's one of the weaker efforts. The biggest problem is the production. There's a sheen over everything that makes it sound artificial, particularly the vocals, which sound so polished that you can barely distungiush them. This is a big contrast as compared to the band's first 2 albums (Junta + Lawn Boy), which sound crisp and fresh.There's also a questionable tracklist - Tweezer really doesn't work here. Live, this song has led to some of the most unbelievable music I've ever heard, but here the jam is stiff and pointless. While there are some good recordings (Mango Song and Stash), on the whole these songs really work better live than on this recording. Basically I think on this album (major label debut) they tried to do too much and as a result lost focus."
4,Cool Dance CD,"Really good CD. I really enjoyed the La Bomba Remix. However, I do prefer the original Corazon De Melao song, this one is a little too cheesy."
3,Good not Great,The sound of these CDs are very good. I'm not a big fan of this era but any Dylan is worth having. This bootleg series is very worth wild. Can't wait for the Infidels sessions!
3,3.5 stars: Mixed emotions about this,"What I like about the bootleg series so far is the approach of releasing Dylan performances 'as is'. So for vol 5, I am not all happy. Here is why: this a 'ghost' show, made up from bits and pieces from different shows, you dont really get the real deal, you are not getting to hear what the Rolling thunder tour sounded like. Instead, you only get the 'Dylan' show. To make up for it, they throw a couple of tunes in with Joan Baez, which unfortunately, dont work. Each one is going on different directions, Baez chasing Dylan and just not making it. Its just nostalgia. But what I cannot forgive is that they left out the best 2 tracks I have ever heard of this tour: Isis and Romance in Durango (from Biograph) and they replaced them with inferior versions. I think Columbia made some bad decisions on this one. But Dylan is great everywhere, giving some of the best performances of his live on this tour."
2,Falls Short,"Anyone who saw the Rolling Thunder performances will remember its neo-vaudevillian aspects. Of course there was Dylan, but T-Bone Burnett, Kinky Freidman and most especially the violinist Scarlett Rivera added greatly to the mix. Sadly they are no where to be found on this recording of the review in its later stages when Joan Baez signed on for a few perfunctory performances. I am a huge Dylan fan, but this is one live album we could have done without."
4,5 Stars Needs to Mean Something,"OK. This music is alright-- good songs well-performed. But, this is definitely not the best Dylan period. The instrumentation and arrangements are mushy and jumbled. There is a strange disconnect between mood and subject matter, i.e., ""Hard Rain"". Personally, I don't get a great feeling of excitement from these performances. Please-- a 5 Star record should be ground-breaking and perfect. ""Revolver"". ""London Calling"". Dylan's ""Live 1966"". Not this."
4,The Dylan Paradox,"On principle I have never given a live album 5 stars as you are assessing a performance rather than a creative piece of work. I very nearly broke my own rule for this CD. Not only did it preview a very fine album (Desire), it makes a mockery of the live 'Greatest Hits' trash he and others have mostly released.I saw a couple of the shows from his critically aclaimed tour of Oz with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in 1986. He was razor sharp but even those efforts pale when compared to his performances on this legacy from the Rolling Thunder Revue. Buy this CD if you have any interest in Dylan. It is simply a stunning example of just how good Dylan could be when enthused and making music with his mates."
2,emperor bob is wearing no clothes,"Bob Dylan is a genius, but this sh#t is sh#t. Pales in comparison to both the bootleg series concerts from 1964 and 1966. In Rolling Thunder, what's with all the shouting lyrics? Too self-indulgent with his voice and musical arrangements. Plus bland generic 70's rock-style sound from the band. Very overrated music which will not stand the test of time like his better stuff. For hardcore fans only."
3,Volume 5,The best thing about this set is the news that Columbia will FINALLY release the 1964 Philharmonic Hall concert. Wow! Wait'll hear that.
2,Dylan emerges briefly from cocaine coccoon,"But only just. This goofball. Come on people, this is a terrible record. Dylan does some terrible performances on here that are what explain why the 1970s got a bad name. Ha ha ha. Come on!! Dylan did such quantities of drugs before these shows he has only one dynamic style. It is uninteresting. It is not musical. Just yelling. Lots and lots of yelling. To say it gets old... well... it IS old. Here we find Dylan at a dead end. Not a peak. We hear a lot of musicians, but not much music.This era is the reason why some people find Dylan only semi literate musically. Just yelling. But taken on his own terms -- a rich, stoned professional yeller from the 1970s whose audience is overindulgent -- this is one of the greatest albums ever."
3,Could've been worse,"It's amazing how people from Columbia never could dig what Dylan fans really want. This is probably among the reasons for all these bootlegs around Dylan's material. With an exemption of ""Before the flood"" they've never released a live album of any relation to what was going on at concert.Anyway, to release 1975 Rolling Thunder, probably one of Dylan's most creative periods with 20 minutes left on each disk, but without ""Never let me go"", one of the best Dylan covers ever, is simply ridicilous. Just proves the point that they are incapable of appreciating artist's real talents.Anyway, it's a must for any Dylan collection, just being annoying that you still have to grab a boot or 2 to see what was really going down that winter."
5,5 stars is not enough,"This is the best Bob Dylan CD there is. If you like the Blood on the Tracks & Desire era of Dylan then this is the album for you. It is perfect. The band is very strong and tight while sounding relaxed and focused at the same time and Dylan is in top form. If you're one of those people who like the songs but don't care for the singing, this one just might change your mind."
2,not a book for me,Its got SOME good ideas but for the most part I really didnt like this book. I have children of all ages and somedays while good for others WERE NOT good for the other ones. Its like picking days to do big kids things and little kid things. Just not a book for me. Wasnt what I expected.
3,I judged this book by its cover. Oops.,"I bought this book in a fit of consumption at a Books-a-Million because the quirky orange cover and title caught my eye. I expected a sort of Janet Evanovich type of romp, full of whimsy, humor, romance, danger -- just a bit of enjoyable mind candy.Instead, although I found the writing perfectly fine and the descriptions of Hawaii tantalizing, the story itself fell flat. Very disappointing. I can suspend many levels of belief, so I didn't have a problem with the plot per se. It just didn't sparkle for me the way I'd hoped."
2,Adventure in Hawaii,"I found it difficult to believe that a) the lead character would take off to pursue the murder of someone she has only just met and b) that after spending what it would cost to go to Hawaii for a professional conference, she would essentially blow it all off to chase the killer. An interesting use of recombinant DNA makes an appearance."
5,Excellent material for entry-to-mid level C++ users,"this is one of the best marterial i found on how to write good C++ programs. laundry list is the perfect name for this, and keeps up to it's reputation. easy to understand, explained with lucid examples and very clearcut and to-the-point topics are taken up.i wish there was a CD for ""Effective STL"" book too.... it'd make the browsing and learning STL so much more easier."
1,"Does not work with Macintosh OS X, any browser!","This CD is completely incompatible with Macintosh OS X, using any browser I've tried (Internet Explorer 5.1, Netscape 6.2.3, Netscape 7.0, Mozilla, Chimera, Opera, or OmniWeb). Each browser has different problems. All of them have problems so severe as to make the CD unusable. The readme file that comes on the CD, and the web site to which it refers, are no help.Don't touch this with a ten foot pole, if you're using MacOS X!"
5,OK. Everything is fine. How much does it cost.,All said and and done I cannot locate the price of the book on the page any where. Very usefull eh?
4,Great deal,"I was grateful to receive such a fine collection of references all in one CD-ROM (e-Book) format. It seems chock full of sound advice. The price fluctuates; I thank the Lord I was able to get it used for $23.Most everything was fine. The only problem was that, whatever technology was used to bring the feature of being able to resize images in the html documents, apparently no longer works in today's browsers (as I tested it in 2008 in both Firefox and IE on XP). The images appear blank. In practice this is not much of a problem because there are not many images: just a few diagrams, and they can still be found on the disk with some effort. All the text and code examples appear fine. Still a lot for the money."
1,Useless,This CD does not work on modern computers. You need Internet Explorer 4.0 to view it. With other browsers no diagrams are shown.I could not find a bug fix on the authors web page.It is interesting to see that one of the big software gurus doesn't seem to know about graceful degradation. He could have easily added a statically linked HTML-only version to the CD.
4,Reliable Item,This camera works well for taking pictures and making videos. It' s online usage requires a high rate of speed though and picture rate isn't the greatest. But you can see fine and it is a descent item.
4,A good camera,"For the price the unit is very good. Set up is very easy, although there are a lot of superfluous extras in the software package. Resolution is decent considering the price."
4,Very good camera for its price - just buy it,"I got this camera after doing lots of research on Webcams and I am delighted that I made the right choice. I installed it on my Window Me laptop, it was a breeze. Absolutely easy to use and picture quality is excellent. The only thing I wish it had was a small plastic clamp to fix it easily to the top of my laptop screen, I would have rated it 5. For the money I paid , its worth it."
2,"Bad install, Bad Win2k support, otherwise nice if it works.",I spend days with Intel customer support to get my new cam working on Win98. I had to replace dlls and systems files! I addition I had to install some more files manually. It worked! and it was pretty good.Than I upgraded to win2k and also put the new drives provided...The cam is in the dust now. I don't have the time and the nerves to spend another week with Intel on the phone and on top of it pay them for that once more.Try something else.
1,Wouldn't Install,"This is the second Intel PC Camera that I've returned for not being compatible with my system.I'm running Windows Me Program and on trying to install the camera,I received error messages from the Intel Disk saying that it couldn't find certain files which were needed for installation.Upon deleting the camera from my system,the system froze up and I needed technical help from the computer company to fix the problem.No more PC cameras for me.Enjoyment should not include aggrevation."
2,"Bad spring mechanism, bad packaging.","This item is designed to work as it should. However there is a spring mechanism that holds the wrench together to make it work. This spring is very flimsy at best, doesn't hold up to the slightest of tension. It will go out of shape with the slightest tug. I found it very difficult to unwrap the package without damaging the spring mechanism because the shrink wrap is totally wrapped around the product and spring. Once you pull of the shrink wrap, the spring will get bent and the entire wrench becomes useless.Of course right on the package itself is a replacement part number for the spring. How convenient, it must be a part they want to sell a million of because it'll keep getting bent/twisted and become unusable. This spring should be made from heavier duty material that won't bend out of shape so easily. If this spring mechanism is improved on, this product will be 5 stars, however as it is now, this is only a 2 star product."
3,Ok for the price,"Purchased to use on volvo, replaceable element style oil filter. Does the job with some effort. Cannot be used to tighten filter. Just an FYI."
2,Doesn't work on Mercedes filter size,"Feels like a solid metal tool, and it's a clever design, but doesn't get small enough to fit on my filter. Also the little spring that adds tension is flimsy at best. A one meter drop to the ground popped it right off, never to work again."
1,Too big for regular car filters,"3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter."
3,"For large filters, not Bosch","This filter wrench may work fine on larger truck filters, but anything less than 3 1/2"" is probably SOL. Also plan on replacing the ultra-flimsy return spring w. something real. Otherwise pretty solid."
2,3/4 inch of travel on something called Wide Range?,"I think this was my fault for not reading every line of the description before buying. I saw words like wide range and universal and biting teeth... What I missed was that it works from 3 1/8 to 3 7/8 inches... I am sure I'll use it, just not as much use as I'd hoped it would get."
1,Poor design,"The spring does not stay in place, the grip is almost non-ecxistant. I spent an extra 15 minutes wrapping the oil filter with gaffers tape to have the thing work at all."
5,MY WORKER USES IT,"IT HAS HELP MY WORKER DO HIS JOB BETTER,MAKES THING GO FASTER WHEN IS CHANGING OIL ON CUSTOMER CAR.THESE ARE GREAT"
5,This thing is awesome,"This is an absolute must for the shade tree mechanic and regular lube jockey alike. Gets into tight spaces, allows used of extensions / elbows, properly grips filters, and applies correct rotation (some wrenches and methods apply more side pressure than rotation) for removal. Gone are the days of crappy plastic slip on adapters, or running a screwdriver through stuck filters - this thing is my best friend for oil changes."
1,Scam,"The book ""Capoeira - a martial art and a cultural tradition"" is worthless if you're already into Capoeira. Most of the facts (and the song lyrics/translations) have been taken from Bira Almeidas book - ""Capoeira - a brazilian artform"", by that one instead! You can also get better information on Capoeira, just by seraching for ""Capoeira"" on the Internet! But if you want a lousy copy of Almeidas book, including a lot of wrongly named movements and stuff like that, buy this one!Even the layout and photography is bad!Stay away!"
5,Better than I had expected,"I originally heard one of the songs on Pandora so I ordered the CD and was pleasantly surprised. Great songs, vocals and instrumentation. Nice mix of Irish folk with rock."
5,One of the most awesome recordings I have ever heard!,Think Irish Folk and funky Indie with genuine rhythmn and musical talent! This is truly one of the most inspiring CDs I have ever listened to!
2,Sexual Healing dvd review,"I am very disappointed in the dvd. I PUCHASED IT SOLEY FOR THE CONTENT OF ""SEX AFTER MENOPAUSE WHICH WAS BILLED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT AND IS ALSO COVERED IN THE DVD INTRO. THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT THIS SUBJECT ON THE DVD AT ALL.Poor!!!"
3,Okay,"Scores out of 10:music - 9 - pretty good, not too repetitive, i liked itgraphics - 8 - alright, fairly good for computer, but not amazing or anythingcontrols - 8 - they're easy to figure out and they work well.story - 6 - okay, it's somewhat creative, but not explained very well.gameplay - 6 - it's a little confusing to know what to do. and it's just not very fun or rewarding to play.overall, this gets about a 6 or 7 out of 10. it really isn't good as all those 5 star reviews imply. i didn't enjoy it, it just didn't flow very well. and it's too bad it's not multiplayer, that would make it much better. the world is just so large, it's easy to get lost and it's irritating trying to find a person or place. i've seen several better games for free, i don't know if i'd pay so much for this quality - or lack of it. but you may want to check it out, if you're an rpg fan."
4,good game,this all game altoghether was a fun but i coulnt stand this game for some reason probley because i have a short attition spand this game was to slow for me and to much talking i like the games like diablo 2 or final fantasy 1-12-infanite but if you like the kind of game where you go around talking and murdering people in there houses go a head and by this game
2,"A Difficult, Unrewarding Game","You'd better like puzzle-type games if you buy this one. Having not previously played any of the Morrowind series, it took far too much time to simply figure out the controls, all keyboard entries. (Your character is, for unknown reasons, usually invisible.) Then deciphering where to go and how to get there, what your next challenge should be, how to equip yourself and carry on fighting, is far too complex. I even bought the not-too-helpful manual. Give me a game controlled by a mouse anytime."
4,"Old, but still good... if you're not on Vista","I run Windows Vista, and even though you CAN get it to run, you have to run through so many loops and hurdles, it REALLY detracts from the game. If you have XP, I'd definetly recommend this game. If you have Vista, it'll be worth it, but like I said, be prepared to work for it."
4,Great Deal,This was a great deal. The game was in great condition and arrived ready to play in only two days. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,The 'biggest' game ever,"I have played a number of RPGs in my day, and this is by far the biggest game ever. There is no limit to amount of things you can do, and quests you can embark upon. The range of character classes is wide, and the character attributes are quite realistic, though they don't follow D&D to a tee. But no worries, they are quite similar, and you will not be disappointed with the breadth of this game. There are literally hundreds of hours of gameplay available, and you can play this game multiple times without running into the same things so many times.The graphics are not what you would get with Neverwinter Nights, but the gameplay, storyline, and endless possibilities more than make up for this. The real-time fighting is also not as technically true as other D&D RPGs (although, it's not trying to be).Overall, a fabulous game, and has been my favorite for a LONG time now!"
5,Purchase this game as soon as possible,"This is definitely the most enthralling, entertaining, time-consuming, awesome, goregeous, in-depth, and just plain FUN video game I have ever come across, and I've played a lot. The expansions just add on to the original excellent non-linear adventure, and the ability to download and install even more official and unofficial mods/patches/plug-ins that also add to the game make it that much better. This game could not get any better. If you enjoy RPGs, or just any game in general, BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!"
3,Cannot get started,"Game tries to load but fails with the error:Music Error: Can not create filter graph.I've searched the web but cannot find a solution. I've tried reinstalling, changing acceleration options but no luck. I can play Oblivion just fine. Feel free to comment if you have thoughts on this error."
5,Morrowind Game of the year,"Hi- This is my favorite pc game so far. The Game of the year edition runs very smoothly compared to the older version and with the ""mods"" that are now available it becomes a much more modern game. I recommend it highly."
2,dont buy morrowind,This would be a great game if it worked but if you are running Vista or Windows 7 forget it. It's not worth the time and effort to try and make it run correctly. There are a few fixes online out there but trying to find one that is simple to use (for a person who does not want or know how to rewrite the progam)is not easy.I guess I should have reviewed the game more thoroughly before purchase.
2,Would be better if it didn't crash all the time,"I really wanted to like this game. Really! Friends of mine had shown me the gorgeous graphics, and said that the replay value was endless.The problem was I never got though it once. If you had the sound on, it crashed every 10-20 minutes. If you turned the sound off, you might get away with 30 minutes of continuous play. After several hours of this, applying every patch and every suggestion, I gave up."
2,Maybe great back in the day...but today...,Egad. I bought this for my husband because he loved Oblivion so much. I was pretty sad with how dated it was. But I guess that's my fault since the game is around 8 years old. I'm sure it was great back in the day. Too bad we opened it. I wish we could return it...
4,Definately not for the faint of heart!,"This world presented in this game is immersive, detailed and intriguing; Bethesda obviously put a great deal of effort into making a game for die-hard RPG fans. This being said...I couldn't keep playing it. This game is not for the occasional gamer looking to sneak in a couple of hours after work--this game is for those willing to devote entire weeks and even months to exploration and character development. The pace comes closer to approximating that of real life than any I have ever seen--as for me, I don't have that kind of time! For fans of the Baldur's Gate series and KOTOR, don't expect similar gameplay or gamespeed.In conclusion, this game is a work of art but plan on budgeting a huge chunk of time if you want to appreciate it."
5,Great Immersive Experience,"I played Morrowind after Oblivion. So at first I thought it couldn't be all that great like people said. I was wrong. This game is truly a unique and immersive experience and I never tire of playing it. I loved Oblivion, but after playing Morrowind, I have to agree that Oblivion is pretty shallow in comparison.My advice don't always go for the flashy effects or graphics, look for a good story and environments that are alien in nature.Morrowind provides these."
5,Befroe Oblivion there was Morrowind,Does your PC lack the gurth to play Oblivion? Then try the Game that set the bar for RPG's to come. Very Addicting with an unlimited amount of game play.
5,Classic at Least,"One of the most, if not THE most, expansive and intricate games of all time. A must buy for all fans of the RPG genre. The best part is, if you don't like parts of the game use the Construction Set (included) to fix or rebuild anything!"
5,"fast shipping, perfect condition","When i bought this i already knew it was a great game, because ive played it before, its a classic RPG that any hardcore player NEEDS to have. nonetheless, i forgot how amazing this game was for its time period...i fell in love again. also, the CD's were immaculate and new. i was surprised to see a different language on the back of the box as the primary, with English under it but i dont really care. this game shipped from wherever in the states and got to me in afghanistan in less than 10 days. i was surprised but very happy. conclusion: fast shipping, perfect condition, amazing game."
4,I want my life back!,"Okay, so everyone's said it before. But I'm going to play parrot and say it again. This game is incredibly immersive. You forget everything else; hunger, tireness, how numb your arse is from sitting on it... everything. All you can think of is 'just one more mission! Just one!' And then it's 5am and you're wondering where the time went. A game has to be good to be that addictive, and this one certainly is. My only complaints are with the music and the grapics. I found much of the landscape drab and colourless - far too much brown, grey and khaki. It was very gloomy. A little more colour would really improve things. And I found the background music nice, but incredibly grating and repetitive. It was just the same theme playing over and over again! The music didn't even change with setting! I had to turn it off in the end and listen to a CD.But these things are easily ignored. Morrowind is great fun to play, and has more than enough replay value to be worth the cash."
3,great game but does have some problems,"mainly crashes are the downfall with this game, and that's unfortunate because this game is so good. This game makes you save literally every minute or two because of the sheer volume of crashes. Other than that, this is one of the best games I've ever played. It's too bad they couldn't work out the bugs though, it gets really annoying to have to reload your game all the time."
2,Game of the Year...wish I'd known,"Well, I've got a laptop, and this game seizes every 2-3 minutes given that the graphics aren't something that the laptop video card can really handle. I wish I'd known, because I can't play the game at all, and I'm not ready to spend the full cost of a brand new workstation so I can play it.The game is so complicated (keep getting missions to go on while I'm trying to finish the one I'm on) that I wound up buying a guide."
1,"Very boring, quit playing after 2 days","I am a huge fan of the RPG genre and have played just about every one for the PC. Morrowind is the most boring one I have ever played. I turned it off after two evenings of SLOWLY walking around, having stupid repetitive conversations with NPCs, and lamely fighting rats. The interface is terrible. You are very limited in what you can carry, so after you kill a monster you can't even carry your treasure back to town. This ""game"" was all work with no fun. Do not buy!"
1,Don't bother,"Having played Oblivion I was looking for more of the same type of experience but.....the Morrowmind game is a very poor game compared to the vastly superior Oblivion. Graphics and game mechanics such as movement, combat are very primitive...."
1,Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind Game of The Year Edition,"This is ONE OF THE WORSE GAMES I have ever had the displeasure of buying and wasting money on. I personally will never buy another game from Bethesda again. After all of the hype about the game, me and my spouse bought it. After 10 minutes of play, we found that this game required too much camera angling, two hands to use a mouse and keyboard. The hot keys, even customized, required way too much time to even enjoy the game. This game, in my opinion, is for people who enjoy complex playing, and not medium to simple play.I am sure the game is great, but until a version comes along where I don't have to use one hand on the keyboard and the other on the mouse, pass this one by."
5,#1 all-time best game ever created... PERIOD.,"Ok, I've been playing this game for just over a year now, and I have to say, it really IS the best game ever made. There is a truly infinite amount of gameplay, the graphics are awesome, and... you can do anything you want, from slaughtering an entire village for no reason at all, to building a castle out of pillows for the fun of it, and maybe hiding all of your precious items there. Overall, this game gets a 10 out of 10, 5 stars out of 5 stars, and I will be playing it for the rest of my life. :)"
3,Huge Game. Huge.,"Too big, honestly. Free-form. Relatively easy to control in most aspects aside from combat. Stealth is a bit touch and go. BUT. You will never run out of things to do. In fact, there are so many things to do, you'll most likely need the strategy guide. And don't rely on the game to properly keep track of it all..."
3,elder scrolls 3 Morrowind,"I have always loved this game, how eles can you play any of 8 races and do just about anything??? I would most assuredly recomend this game to anyone that asked..."
3,Elderscrolls,Morrowind is a cool game but a lil bit not like im used to. i have never played a rpc game from the year 2002 before so the difference in quality is huge.
3,"Good, but not great.","I played Oblivion before I played this, and so I'm kind of spoiled on the graphical look and gameplay. However, sheer amount of player-made material makes this game very customizable. It also helps that that this will actually run well on my old laptop. :D"
4,newbie,even though i have just started the game and am only 30 minutes into it i have to admit it is probably the most real rpg there will ever be.it got the game of the year award in 2002 and includes 100+ hours of exilerating gameplay and is the best game i have ever played out of my 21 games.
3,Just didn't do it for me.,"After reading all of the rave review I decided to take the plunge and buy this game. I am mainly into sports titles but I really enjoyed Diablo I and II, KOTOR I and II and a plethora of other Star Wars titles. I was mainly looking for something along the lines of KOTOR and Diablo gameplay wise with a good story line.After creating my character I was off and running. The world of Morrowind is gigantic and there is a plethora of things you can do. Unfortunately, for me, this was the games biggest downfall. The depth was so great that I felt like I was never really getting anywhere. It was taking forever to explore and uncover the map and trying to keep ontop of all the info you were given from NPC's about the history of the land and whatnot was a bit overwhelming. After putting in about 10-15 hours of gameplay I decided that it was just too time consuming to keep going and I gave up."
5,My best video game ever,What i can say about this game. When it was released and i saw it it was like no other game . I have never seen so good graphics ant i was astonished. The story is simply one of the best ever. There are many many quests and side-quests and so many things to do. Then we have the mods and the expansions - i have been playing this and only this game for 6 months and i enjoyed each and every moment. I dont know how it feels to play this game nowadays but by my experience this is the best ever game i have played. If you dont have a problem with the graphics then this is a must . You need a lot of time to really enjoyed but its an amazing experience.
5,Addictive,"This game is incredible to play. All I can say, is I am addicted to it. It's something that keeps you coming back for more, time after time. I only wish it was slightly better when it comes to freezing up. That is probably the only part I do not like."
5,Best Game,"If you love fantasy worlds, medevil times, and fun never ending gameplay this is the game for you! This games lets you customize your character from tons of different races then you do what ever you want. There are hundreds of different weapons, armor, items, and ingredients. You increase your skills buy leveling up. You can learn tons of spells. There are millions of quests everywhere to do. And you don't have to do them. There is also a main quest with a storyline there are million of ways you can beat the game. You can go any where in this giant expansive world and join factions and groups. You can be evil or fight evil. It is like the best. you can play this game forever it never gets boring and it never ends. A must buy."
1,Riddled with errors. A disaster.,"I've coached reviews for the SAT I, SAT II subject tests, AP exams, PSAT and the SSAT/ISEE. I've used almost all of the test prep guides available. Barron's SSAT/ISEE 2005 edition has more typos and errors on the practice tests than any guide I've ever encountered. It's as if the authors made zero effort to proofread the practice sets. Very discouraging for the student."
1,for stock springs only,Will not fit in the Rancho leaf springs (RS44148) will work for stock *1993 JEEP CHEROKEE COUNTRY* leaf springs. Not sure about other lift kits but it will not fit Rancho. Now i have to see if amazon can help me out. Amazon is pretty good so i wont hold this against them.
3,Not as good as Legalize It,"While this CD has a couple of really good singles (like ""Where's The Bomb At""), it really isn't up to par with the underground, smoked out feeling of the first album ""Legalize It"". If you're looking for a good weed CD, try that one."
5,THE STONE AGE,WHEW !!! I LIKE THIS ONE BETTER THAN LEGALIZE IT.....LOTS MORE CATCHY WEEDISMS....LOVE TO HEAR THESE CATS OVER DR DRE BEATS....LOVE THE T SHIRT TOO... I GOT MINE ON AMAZON.
3,its ok,"if you've gone through nursing school, don't bother. if you like to google everything, go for it. its good if you don't know anything about healthcare."
2,Unsatisfying,"It took me a long time to get into this book. I found the writing to be stilted and unnatural rather than poetic and flowing. Other than Kin, I didn't feel much for any of the characters and found it hard to understand their motivations. The descriptions were very good but got to be too lengthy and ultimately obscured the action and made me want to skip paragraphs. The ending was a letdown and the characters seemed to just arrive there bewildered rather than having reached any sort of closure."
1,Not the item I expected,I expected that my kids would be able to transfer data from one Xbox360 hard drive to another Xbox360 hard drive. This is not at all what I got and I am very disappointed. I have returned this item and I have no idea if I am going to be able to get a refund at this time.
1,Doesn't work with 256mb Memory Card,"I bought this product to go with my 256mb memory card. It says that it works for 64mb and 512mb cards, but evidently it doesn't work with 256mb cards..."
4,"Ignore all other reviews, product is great!","This product performs exactly as advertised, it transfers all of your data from a memory card to Pc. Other reviewers obviously did not take the time to LOOK at the description of the product before purchasing it. Don't rate a product 1 star because you were an idiot and bought the wrong item, doing so is absurd. You wouldn't go to the grocery store and buy an orange, then complain that you weren't able to make apple pie with it would you? Anybody who complained about the product not transferring data from the HDD is out of there mind, simply by looking at the picture you can tell that this product is designed specifically for Memory Cards! The only reason that this product did not receive a 5 star rating is because it does not work for the 256 megabyte version of the Xbox 360 MU, which in my opinion makes zero sense. Otherwise does exactly as advertised and is incredibly useful for backing up and sharing valuable game saves."
4,transfer complete,Works really well to transfer the information I needed from the old Xbox360 memory card to the new Xbox360 slim console.
1,POOR - out dated,"Dont buy this, it doesnt work, its old and its out dated and its more of a hassle to figure out how to get it working than its worth. Dont bother."
1,I guess I'm an idiot.,"I've always considered myself kinda smart but for some reason I had the distinct impression that this device would back up my hard drive, and yes, I read the description before I ordered. I really wonder if the description has been clarified, it's been awhile since I ordered it since I pre-ordered a book at the same time and had them shipped together. At any rate, I'll be dealing with a return and trying to get the right item this time."
2,Stupid,This is great if you want to download rosters for sports games (which is what I only use it for) the stupid thing is that it only works with a 64MB memory card
2,Memory Card Transfer - NOT HARD DRIVE!,"First I will say that I did get what I ordered and the item is flawless. However, when I was ordering, I was looking for a Hard Drive transfer cable. This item is for Memory Cards only. This is not the sellers fault, but mine for not reading the lables. If you are looking for a Hard Drive tranfer cable, this is not it. Other then that, this seller has great speed with shipping and a great product. Thank you! The reason the product was rated as 2 Stars is because it is not what I wanted. This may not be fair, but if you are looking for a device that does Memory Cards, then I would give it 5 Stars."
4,Xbox 360 Transfer Kit,"Ok, when I first looked at this thing I thought It would be a cheap piece of plastic... But its not! Very easy to use... The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 star is because the Software that comes with it is useless and doesnt work. I just download some other (FREE) software.Great product though!"
1,XBox 360 Transfer Kit doesn't work,"Doesn't work. Won't transfer files to your pc. There is a known problem with it, the info has been posted on the web, manufacturer has released a patch to fix it, and the patch only works for SOME people. We wasted our money on this one."
3,It does its job,IT HELPED ME WHEN I NEED TO USE IT FOR ONE TIME BUT THE CD THAT COMES WITH IT IS USELESS. I HAD TO DOWNLOAD XPORT360 IN ORDER TO USE IT. BUT IF YOU NEED TO TRANSFER THIS DOESNT WORK ANYMORE SINCE MICROSOFT NOW LETS TRANSFER BY USB FLASHDRIVE
1,Does NOT work with 64 bit systems,"This software does not work with Windows 7, there is not a driver. The company web site claims it will work with Vista 64 bit, but it did not work for me. Emailed the company, no reply after 10 days. There was no disclaimer in the specifications regarding what operating systems are compatible with this software."
1,Can't transfer saves from HDD to PC,"I bought this because my 360 had crapped out on me. Big surprise, I know. I wanted to transfer my saves from my 20GB HDD to my new 250GB HDD. This wasn't made to do that. This was made to transfer files from the rarely used (and now completely unsupported) memory cards to your PC. At least it was cheap."
1,Product doesn't work on Vista or Windows 7,"I was very excited when I got this item at home but was annoyed after five minutes of anger! I installed the product on the disk, that was provided, on my computer. Once the program was downloaded I attached the USB reader and attached my memory card. I knew something was wrong as soon as the USB reader had problems finding the proper driver. After going over my steps I decided to do some research. After reading numorous forums and going to the companys website, I found out that this item only works with XP! There is no updates for this item so it is basically a waste of money. I did find some helpful videos with this problem but I personally have not gotten this product to work. So just be aware when buying this item. I can't tell you if it works or not because I cant even get it to run."
1,"Watch crashes when ""indiglo"" button is pressed","This watch (and 2 others I've bought from the same seller) have crashed (the screen shows gibberish and eventually goes blank) when I pressed the ""indiglo"" button. I did get a return, but I doubt it'd be worth the risk. Save yourself trouble and do not buy!"
3,Too bad it's not in Greek.,"A wonderful Theodorakis composition, but sung in German and not the original Greek. Too bad."
5,Excellent Price,"It took me a lot of reading and talking to others before I decided on this dual point distributor. While the Unilite distributor seems to be a quality product, I decided against it because if it fails on the road, you had better have a replacement in the trunk ready to go because you probably won't be finding a replacement without ordering it. The stock dual point distributors have worked fine for me for many years and I see this Mallory as being a huge improvement over stock. Because I am running multiple carbs and a long cam for the street, I do not have any vacuum anyway and this distributor has a large range of initial timing advance. I have not run it yet but will do so well before the manufacturers warranty expires. I shopped all over for price and found Amazon's price to be the lowest and the no tax and free shipping was just icing on the cake."
2,Not fresh,"Having purchased these cookies previously at the grocery store, I had high hopes, but the packages I received and have since shared with anyone who will eat them, were not fresh at all. They were w/in the time frame on the package and did not appear to be damaged but were just not up to snuff. Think I will stick to purchasing them locally, one bag at a time."
3,NOT GLUTEN FREE (wheat free & dairy free),"This is just an important warning for those who might see the wheat free and believe these are gluten free. Barley flour, the first ingredient, is gluten. Many people who cannot eat wheat cannot have any gluten. I am posting this to hopefully prevent someone from getting sick by consuming gluten. (Kinni-Toos are gf and the closest to an Oreo I've found)."
1,Yuck!,"I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large..."
2,Probably Good but Nonreturnable!,"It turns out my father can't eat Ginger anymore either (see my other review about Newman's Own Organics Newman-O'S, Chocolate Crème, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)). So we wanted to return these too but...caveat emptor (let the buyer beware), grocery items are not returnable to Amazon! They are getting donated to the women's shelter, a noble but not originally intended gesture."
2,Probably Good but Unreturnable!,"It turns out my father can't eat chocolate anymore so we wanted to return them but...caveat emptor (let the buyer beware), grocery items are not returnable to Amazon! They are getting donated to the women's shelter, a noble but not originally intended."
5,Dip them in chocolate and wow your friends!,"These cookies are superb all by themselves. Far superior to ""that other sandwich cookie"" in every way. But if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence, melt some Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips in your double boiler, and dip these cookies, then remove to a rack to dry. Your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store, and beg you for more. Keep out of reach of children!"
5,"When chocolate Nutter Butters went away, I was sad. :(","But... then I found chocolate peanut butter Newman-O's and everything was right with the world again... in terms of cookie satisfaction, that is.I prefer to pull two of them apart, eating the two naked cookie halves - then smash the two halves w/peanut butter together to make a ""double stuff"" Newman-O. In my humble opinion there is no finer store-bought cookie enjoyment experience available on Earth at the current time.This is what you wave under my nose to make sure I'm REALLY dead."
5,"Delicious, taste exactly like the ""O"" cookies.","I loved my Oreos, but stopped eating them a few years ago for health reasons. Just got my order in for the Newmans Own and they are excellent! I used the Subscribe & Save and paid $10.27, so ~$1.60/ bag. Great deal, great cookies, great cause....Win/Win/Win!I simply could not tell that I wasn't eating the name brand Oreos, but it has been a couple of years since I had the original. I certainly will buy more, and in fact, have ordered the Ginger-O's already, but have yet to receive them.Don't hesitate to try these organic gifts from above. :)"
2,Just Not a Fan,"I've previously tried, and liked, Newman-O's chocolate sandwich cookies but found these bland, boring and completely free of ginger taste. The texture was try and just overall the only flavor was ""sweet"" ... generic sugar taste and nothing more. Just not a fan."
5,Really good,"It may be true that organic food, especially snacks, are more expensive than processed ones, but Newman-O's taste pretty awesome. The flavor is practically indistinguishable from Mint Oreo's and are very reminiscent of Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies, so if you're willing to fork over the extra money for an organic Mint Oreo, then go for it! The flavor really doesn't disappoint!"
3,Celiac's Beware!,"These cookies are delicious however, they are not Gluten Free. The new labels state this clearly. Although they have no wheat, they are made with Barley Flour and are extremely caustic to those with Gluten Intolerance or allergy."
2,Not exactly girl scout quality,"I had visions of Girl Scout cookies and my favorites, the mint wafers, to be exact. Well, these are not it. These cookies are simply sandwich cookies in the traditon of Oreo, but with a mint filling. If they had more stuffing they might have been good; as it was, they were too dry. And lacking a chocolate icing like Girl Scout wafers, they leave a gritty Oreo lingering feeling after you eat them."
5,Wheat free Newman O's!,I love these wheat free Newman O's! Not quite as good as Oreos or regular Newman O's but they are really good. If you have kids on a wheat free diet these will make them very happy indeed! Amazon has these at a very good price with Subscribe & Save. These are hard to find and Whole Foods charges a lot more.
4,Very Addictive!,"Beat you can't just have 1!!! =)These are great cookies and we found out about them from our local grocery store. However they raised the price and we thought we'd take a look on Amazon to see how much it would be. Much to our delight, buying in bulk really lowered the price and to bout, we qualified for the Free Shipping.The only complaint I have is that we ordered these cookies in Oct. 2009 and the expiry is Dec. 2009. Kind of ridiculous to think that they expect you to finish 12 units of these cookies in 2 months.Love the cookies, hate the expiry date."
1,Save your money.,"With shipping this item was near thirty dollars when I purchased, and intended it to be a gift for a niece. The legs to the plastic ballerina are attached to the body with hook-type metal pieces that show as the skirt on the doll is poofed up so it looks really, really tacky and cheap. Not to mention probably unsafe for too young a child. The dome is plastic and doesn't even attach to the music box, it just kind of sits there as long as the music box is on a flat surface.There are cheaper nutcracker themed music boxes to be found(as well as more expensive)but how ironic I bought this in lieu of a 'cheaper' one! I'm only giving it one star in each category as it doesn't give no stars as an option."
4,Great,"The book was smaller than I thought it would be. It's a great dictionary of idioms, things are pretty easy to find. I wish that there was some history along with it but otherwise it's a very good book."
1,Not what I need,"For a language learner, this sort of reference is mostly useless. What I needed and hoped for was a list of idioms in order of use importance so I could use the book as a learning aid. Listing idioms in alphabetical order just does not help. Often times, a beginner does not even know that a word is part of an idiom or what words appear in the idiom. In that case, how can a student be expected to even be able to look the idiom up in the book? I can not imagine why anyone would need this book in their collection."
1,impossible,dont confuse a review of the book (good) with the value of that book on a kindle (i.e. worthless). My experience so far with Kindle language books is they are worthless or at least very awkward to use. Kindle digitization does not handle columns of data or certain formatting codes. BEWARE!
3,Barrons German Idioms,"Big Problem:: The printing is far too small-- a magnifying glass is required to read it -- the print should be newspaper size print. Hardly a book for the Holiday maker.!! Also, I required 2 Idioms-- neither of which were in the book.!! It does give a lot of useful Idioms though."
3,No One Says That,"Another example of Barrons missing the mark. The idioms in this book are seldom if ever used in the circles in which I run in Germany. It may only be my experience, but for the most part there is little to no use for the phrases in this book. I would also like to see them organized in a contextual way, but I have yet to find a book that is organized like that."
4,Parsi Intolerance,"Thrity Umrigar is great. Having read her three books I get a good image of Parsi life in Bombay.Like many Indians, I take pride in saying that India sheltered many religions over centuries. I was disappointed that it becomes obvious from Umrigar's books that the Parsis have no appreciation of that. Non-Parsis even had to tolerate finding human body parts in their front doors and yards, vultures having dropped them there after having their fill, thanks to the Parsi custom of allowing dead bodies to be eaten by vultures. I know how upsetting it is to pious Hindus.It only goes to show minorities can never be totally happy in any country, even the most liberal. Keeping one's culture may make an interesting reading, but integration and assimilation brings happiness."
4,Entertaining read,"I enjoyed ""Bombay Time"". It's a bunch of small tales about the lives of various neighbors who get together for a wedding reception. The stories are mostly sad, mainly due to lost love.My only complaint about this book is the ending is too dragged out."
3,Small scale malgudi,"Wadia Baug is an apartment complex (known as flats/colony) in Bombay with families, bound to one another by ties of religion and ethnicity. A small scale Malgudi. A simple, heart felt well-written story about them transports us to this quaint world. I actually learnt a thing or two about relationships here.Would recommend it any one who feels about communities and is afraid we are losing that sense of connectedness."
4,...and i thought i knew the amish.,"this book has only 48 pages but,i learned alot that i DID NOT know about amish.what stands out in my mind is how the amish TRULY live their faith. i have neverseen a group of people so devoted to their beliefs and way of life. i think thereis much to admire in the amish. amish people are all about their faith and FAMILY.john hostetler's book contains different subjects:history of,view of other anabaptists (like mennonites),arriving in america,agriculture,non-technology,amishwho do not farm,family life,schooling,young people,spiritual ""birth"",marriage,bonding of amish community, amish rules,losing amish to the outside world,beingamish in america,dealing with government,and,joy of life (each subject i just mentioned is presented as a short essay in the book). this is a great book forreaders wanting a straight,clear understanding of the amish and their way of life.this book does have color photos of the amish life. nice."
2,See track three for my review title.,"This album was weak by all means. Lynch Mob without Oni Logan is like Dokken w/o Don Dokken. I loved the first mob album so much that I was trying hard to give this one a chance, beleieve me I tried. It's back on amazon now.If this album was worthy of an award it would be for ""The worst Queen cover ever."""
2,This is actually not so good,"When Lynch Mob changed singer, they made a terrible mistake. The debut album is so much better and not just the singing but also the material. Skip this one if you want more than mediocre or average heavy metal."
3,Not as good as wicked sensation,"Pretty good, but like a couple of other reviewers have already stated, it's not as good as wicked sensation. Kind of like a little to polished sounding Lynch Mob. Could have been released by dozens of other 80s bands."
2,Self-Titled Second Effort is Second Rate,"The 1992 follow-up to Wicked Sensation is fair. With the change to new vocalist Robert Mason, this album just didn't go anywhere. The songs Tangled in the Web, No Good and Dream Until Tomorrow are pretty good, the rest are mediocre in my book. And watch out for the third release (yuck) from George Lynch, it's not at all like these first two albums."
2,"Not Good, nothing new","George Lynch was always one of my favourite guitar players, even playing in that horrible band Dokken. But with this one, he did nothing new, only there is more room to show his virtuosity. The singer is horrible, the songs are irregular."
3,Gets the job done,"Lynch Mob's self-titled second full-length album was released in 1992. There are ten tracks. The material is in a straightforward hard rock musical direction. Throughout, the songwriting is satisfying, the musicianship is tight, and the sound quality is good. Robert Mason does well with the singing, and George Lynch's guitar playing does not disappoint. Guest vocalist Glenn Hughes provides additional background vocals. The band performs a cover of the Queen composition ""Tie Your Mother Down."" Certain cuts contain minimal keyboard and brass instrumentation. Some of the songs I like are ""Tangled in the Web,"" the power ballad ""Dream Until Tomorrow,"" and ""Cold Is the Heart."" The CD booklet sports interesting drawings. The CD booklet's backcover displays a color photo of the group. The disc is almost 48 minutes. This album is solid."
3,Not same voltage as original Garmin 396 battery,"The battery that was shipped to me says ""7.4V"" on the label. The original battery that came with my Garmin 396 says ""8.4V"" on the label. The battery fits the 396 and seems to power the unit, but the battery indicator on the 396 never indicates full even though the 396 reports ""charging complete."" It appear that the 396 can handle charging this lower-voltage battery, but the battery charge state indicator on the 396 will not show it as full."
1,EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HORRIBLE IDEA,My friend bought these for her children and she tried them out first. She fell backwards and landed on her elbow and has since had 2 surgeries to repair the damage. The company has done nothing for her or her medical bills. Her elbow is permanantly fused and bent. She will never be able to have full mobility of her elbow. This is a horrible product and she is one of many who has had accidents using this product...
2,This one fell short for me,Book 4 in this series was definitely not as good as the previous ones and by the end I felt myself very frustrated and unsure I want to continue this series.
1,Booooring,"One of my best friends says that he's never read a book that he hasn't learned something from, well, he obviously hasn't read this one.... Riley, our sexually 'free' dhampir, continues on her quest to fight evil. If you took all of the repetitions of ""I don't want to be a paid killer"" and ""I won't go exclusive until I find my soul mate"" and ""desire flared"" and the like out of the book the book would shrink to half its size and that half isn't much better or more interesting. The only book worth its money was #1 in the series and while I was sucked into reading 2, 3, and 4 I will not read #5 or any subsequent ones. My time is too valuable and there are so many much better books to read!"
3,Dark very dark,"This book is much darker than the first three and I don't like the direction in which Riley was taken with the S&M. I enjoyed the first three books, this one I just wanted to get through so I'd know what happened and be set up for the next book in the series - but I'm not sure that I want to read any more. Disturbing, this book is, very disturbing."
4,maegrn,"As paranormal goes this is a good book. It has action, romance, and intrigue. I have read all of the books in this series and would suggest them to anyone that likes paranormal romance."
3,Great Development,"The Riley Jensen books are usually something I turn to when I have absolutely nothing else to read. However, ""Dangerous Games"" turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. After book 3 (which was almost too ridiculous for words), I had extremely low expectations for book 4, and wasn't even sure I could make it through. However, Arthur really came through. The storyline itself was much more meaty, which made the novel more interesting and satisfying to follow. I felt like Arthur found a nice balance between plot and ""romance,"" and ""Dangerous Games"" really held my interest until the end."
5,Everything is catching on fire,"This cd is beyond belief. Beyond all known things. Beyond imagination of the imaginable imaginative. I have listened, and have found, that time and space are now a mystery to me. You MUST for your own health,safety,and sanity, purchase this beautiful display of words placed in no certain order. On a scale of one to ten, this cd is awesome."
3,Not their best,"Although this is an alright album, I definately think it came at the time when TMBG started to go downhill. It containes some alright songs, but it misses out on the instant hits of previous albums such as ""Put your hand inside the puppet head"" and ""Don't let's start"". Also I personally feel that some of the experimentation on this album comes across as quite forced (though this is generally inevitable when a hobby becomes a job). If someone was unfamiliar with the band, i would recomend they buy ""Then, the earlier years"" or ""Flood"" before deciding if they wanted to complete their collection.Kristofski"
4,Their best work.,"1 -star? It looks like Conor O' Sullivan is of the ""Limp Bizket/Saliva/Backstreet Boys"" crowd, for Factory Showroom and Severe Tire Damage are embarassing relics compared to this gem. If nothing, buy it for I Palindrome I... one of the most brilliant songs ever crafted, and appreciate it for its expanse of lyrical profundity, confusion, and strange, lovable music. This is the REAL TMBG!"
2,"If you loved Flood, you'll only like this CD","Compared to their Flood album, this one is quite different and Only 4 songs here remind you of their earlier works. Too bad they can't keep to the same style of music like Birdhouse in your soul. Based on a few reviews from people on other cd's I've bought, I strongly suggest listening to song samples instead of just buying cds based on band/singer reputations or the reviews. I made this mistake several times. If you don't have a sound card, purchase the tape instead to save you money or just wait until you can get a sound card. The harder the music is to get, the bigger tha gamble their quality becomes."
3,funny stuff,"The only way to explain this c.d. is that it is like a strange adult version of children sing-a-longs. Pretty catchy with odd lyrics (such as; I walk along darkened cooridoors or turn around, theirs a skull there on the ground)my favorite one being either mammels or turn around.All and all this is a good c.d. for something completely different, and a good chuckle"
5,Their Best to Date,"Apollo 18 is the best They Might Be Giants album to date. Why? For one, all of the songs are consistent and are fun to listen to. And I must mention FINGERTIPS next. There is no other song like it in the world. It is a collection of several musical styles with a higher than normal amount of TMBG lunacy. You must hear it to appreciate it. Then there is THE STATUE GOT ME HIGH. Where else can you hear the lyric ""Your turn to view the stone and then your turn to burn."" Classic TMBG stuff there. While the lyrics of TURN AROUND are grim, it is a song the whole family can sing along and enjoy. It is just so much fun! There is so much to say about this album and I can't mention it all. This is a must have for fans and music collectors alike."
3,"Not the best, but has some highlights","This TMBG album has some wide and glaring weak spots. It is certainly not the peak of their career, but there are still moments of genius, as in ""I Palindrome I"", ""The Statue Got Me High"", and even ""Mammal.""Skip this one if it's your first purchase, though, and get ""Flood"" instead. It can be rather hard to digest in places."
5,led bulb,"This is the best thing one could ever get for their maglite. The led is really bright, brighter than the standard bulb, and the batterys just seem to last forever.You get to keep your maglite, (which is like carrying a club and light in one,) without downsizing your flashlight. All the other newer designed LED FLights are all really small b/c they dont need the batterys.Seller was real fast, got the item quick. A+++"
3,I was expecting something better...,"The seatcover color wasn't exactly as showed. The front part is ok, but the back part quality is too delicate, sensitive to the minimun scratch."
1,Wrong item # for color,"I ordered a set of seat covers in Grey because my car is Grey. But I received Brown seat covers because the item numbers were wrong. I returned them requesting my money back and I only recevied a portion because of shipping and restocking charges, I feel the mistake was not mine You sent me the wrong color. I WILL NEVER buy from you again."
5,"If you love the Owens Valley, this book is for you.","The Story of Inyo presents a comprehensive view of the history and geology of the Owens Valley, beginning with its first inhabitants, and extending through the conflict with the City of Los Angeles.What makes the book special is that it presents it from the perspective of one of the prominent citizens of the Valley during its formative years, newspaperman and author W.A. Chalfant. When you pick up this book, not only do you get some very insteresting facts about the Owens Valley, you also get to read them in a writing style that was prevalent at the time that the history was being made. It's like reading about history and stepping back into it at the same time.The Story of Inyo should be perhaps the first choice for anyone interested in the history or geology of the Owens Valley."
5,I loved this book!,The Invisible Wall was a most interesting book.It held your attention throughout. You didn't want to put it down.The history of England between Jews and Christians in this poor neighborhood was facinating.I learned things I never knew.I wish there was a sequel.
3,Climbing over the Invisible Wall...slowly.,"I bought The Invisible Wall for book club meeting and was thinking it would be along the vein of Angela's Ashes. However, other than being about poor ethnic people in Europe, that's the last likeness.I began the story becoming involved with the family and truly hating the father (you will too) but eventually half way through the book I kept thinking when is this big secret they promise on the back of the book gonna arrive. The story never seemed to speed up, while a bit interesting and making you happy you live in your own warm home, it doesn't grab or teach anything.Progress of the plot is slow with a telling of events from morning to night and that pace never really changes.I say, read Angela's Ashes if you want to feel the brunt of poverty linked with a good story."
3,The Invisible Wall,this book flowed nicely; it illustrated how religion played an integral part within a small community; I learned a little more about a religion I was not familiar with as I have done so with prior books regarding the Jewish aspect of life.
4,Great book discussion choice,"Harry Bernstein's memoir, ""The Invisible Wall"" is a great choice for book discussion groups. Although it is not a difficult read, the vividly drawn characters and themes of cultural divides and religious prejudices give plenty of meat for discussion. Bernstein's book gives us a fascinating glimpse into the life of an impoverished English neighborhood during and following World War I. The portrait is more than a little bleak; life for Bernstein's family was often difficult, and he doesn't sugarcoat it. Despite the sadness, there are moments of happiness and hope. ""The Invisible Wall"" is also a story of love finding a way in the face of immense opposition. You will not be disappointed in this moving memoir."
2,I Actually Did Put the Book Down Several Times,"I put this book down a few times--when I fell asleep reading it. I really wanted to like this book. I got it on special order from my bookstore. The story is just not alive. The book is totally without humor. The characters who appear as neighbors in the book are hard to differentiate. The dialogue is wooden. Events seem to live in a timeless, de-natured way in the author's memory. They do not unfold in the book. There is a lack of energy about the whole thing. It is just not very interesting. The book is in no way like Angela's Ashes. If Harry Bernstein had been sixty-six instead of ninety-six would this book have been published based on its merits? I am sure it would not have been."
3,A Good Read,"I received this as a Christmas present. The basic premise is that that author (writing this in his 90's) grew up in sort of a working-class ghetto in England, a mill town. His street was literally divided by half, one side Jewish and one side Christian. Bernstein's story begins before WWI and describes the ways in which the two sides mixed or ostracized in a cautious dance. His drunken father never left enough money for the kind mother and her kids, so mom is forced to forage for spoiled vegetables which she then cleans up and sells from her home. This ""store"" becomes a communal hearth for the Jewish women, but all is torn asunder when Harry's bright sister marries the Christian across the way. A family gathering for the couple after they have a baby brings the two sides somewhat together. Very reminiscent of Angela's Ashes . . ."
5,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was a book club pick that came in second only after the first book selected was not in print, how unbelievably lucky do I feel? This book is absolutely amazing. The story and all the details make you feel like you were a part of this family sharing in all the good times and bad. As a previous reviewer mentioned, this book has a truly heart breaking story but it is absolutely uplifting and hopeful. I read it in a week and could not put it down. As soon as I finished reading The Invisible Wall I ran right out to the store and picked up The Dream, Harry Bernsteins follow up, I've had the book for one day and already and am half way through it. This is a must read, wonderful, wonderful book."
3,A Jewish Angela's Ashes,"This memoir of a life in England during World War I was written by a man in his 90s. His memory of conversations and events is amazing. The invisable wall of the title is the line on the street where he lives, with Jews on one side and Christians on the other. There is no interaction between the two groups until a forbidden marriage takes place. In his afterword the author suggests that the world would be a better place if there was more inter-marriage. It is a life of poverty in this family of many children and a cruel father. The mother is a martyr who struggles to raise her family in spite of all the obstacles."
4,A Love Story and More,"Bernstein writes about his childhood in the years before and during the First World War. On one level it's a love story about a forbidden relationship between his Jewish sister and the Christian boy she later marries. But it also covers poverty, Jewish/Christian relations, and the young men who went to fight in the war and the loved ones left behind. A really good read. Hard to believe he wrote this in his late nineties!"
3,Size matters,"This product is the smaller of two different sizes of the Scotch-Brite Magic erasing pad. I have used both sizes and the Mr. Clean version. All three products do a great job cleaning, but they disintegrate as you scrub. I presume it is designed to do so. The large size of the Scotch-Brite brand worked best for me. Both the Mr. Clean version and the smaller Scotch-Brite fell apart very quickly. As they began to fall apart, they become very hard to hold. On the larger Scotch-Brite product, even as the white part disintegrated the blue part held it together and functioned as a grip. Thus, I highly recommend the Large version of the Scotch-Brite Easy Erasing Pad. It is a very effective cleaning tool."
2,Get Magic Eraser instead,"This product is an inferior version of ""Magic Eraser"". This product falls apart much more quickly, and the blue sponge on the back of the actual eraser pad is really cheap -- one of those plastic-y sponges that leaves streaks because it isn't very absorptive."
2,Good food guide,"When you have Gestational Diabetes, you are basically going to find all your information from your Doctor and Diabetic Counseling, there really isn't any one book that tells you anything more than you already know. I thought this books Chapter 5 on Food, Food, Food was helpful. It allowed me to make up my own menus following their guidelines on what to eat. It was pretty much the same guidelines I got from my nutritionist but my nutrionist never gave me as many choices. I would recommend this book to someone with Gestational Diabetes, because of that chapter, and it does give the same information as your Doctor."
3,Looking for menu direction,"Bought this book because of Chapter 5: ""Food, Food, Food"" - in hopes that it would help me with sample menus. The chapter provides ONE sample menu... and not a very helpful one. The lunch time meal is tuna, which (as any pregnant woman knows) is a taboo food. Some of the guidelines were beneficial (like eat every 3 hours), but nothing new (all information previously provided by my doctor)."
1,Managing Your Gestational Diabetes: A Guide for You and Your Baby's Good Health,"The information is out of date and the information is not accurate. The copy right date is 1994, the book should not longer be available to purchase."
1,Tribute to Mahalia Jackson,"Had hoped for more,however, it left me longing for the real thing. Cannot touch Mahalia's great powerful voice.More emphasis was placed upon the music and oft times the vocals seemed to compete. Not good."
4,Obedience,"In this book Archbishop Roberts writes on how obedience is the key to Power not having a corrupting affect on those who hold it. He uses the example of the ""Black Popes"", which is the title given to the Jesuit Generals who serve for life. But the Order has safeguards to insure that the authority if its Superior general does not corrupt. And shares other examples where those who have held absolute power who where able to distinguish between its Source and its human holder. And some example of those that held the positions and the disasters that can occur when assumes the position of power and does not know how to use it justly. This would make a good text for the study of Saint Ignatius' ""intelligent obedience."""
2,Delivery was too slow.,"I was in need of this product to restore proper operation of my kitchen cabinet lighting. After waiting over 2 weeks for delivery, I purchased it at a local store at the same price. I wish I hadn't waiting so long to pursue another option! My order arrived the very next day. I will be returning it without opening it as I don't need it anymore."
5,Bright,I use these on my lawn tractor for mowing at dusk - they are much brighter than the factory ones and let me see far enough ahead to be able to mow and stay within the lines. I would buy them again.
1,Waste of money imo,I upgraded (supposedly) all the exterior bulbs in my 2010 Soul. I did one side at a time to see the difference and I saw none. Would never by again ;(
3,LA Guns it is NOT but...,"It is worth a listen. When I heard that Phil and Brent Muscat (ex-Faster Pussycat) were working together on this cd, I was really excited. I was expecting a harder edge than what is on this album. As a matter of fact, I didnt like it all at first but being a HUGE LA Guns fan I gave it a second chance. It does really take time to grow on you. Overall, Im glad I have this cd in my collection but am somewhat disappointed. Thats okay now that Phil is back with LA Guns!"
1,Ripped off!,"I paid $99.00 for what was said to be a new Phil Lewis solo CD. I paid that much only becouse I wanted it as a collecters item. When my CD arrived it wasn`t sealed or in plastic wraper., not to mention both side of the case was broke all the way through. I have 20 year old CDs in better shape! I will not ever do busniess with this seller again!!"
5,Excellent,"Im a huge LA Guns fan, and even bigger Phil Lewis fan. More Purple Than Black is simply a great addition to anyones collection. Phil is just a great singer who can sing just about any song and make it great. I do miss the Lewis/Guns days, and I have been waiting for and wishing that Phil would put out some more solo work. Access Denied and More Purple Than Black are both highly recommended!"
3,"whoa, out there....","this cd truly defines phish as the ultimate cult band gone popular. while this cd came out several years before they made it big, it has the most phishy smell of any of their studio releases to date. speaking truthfully, you will either love this album with all your heart or hate it with such a passion you will smash it to pieces. the songs are all amazing, precise, and as original as rock based music can be. the lyrics are so quirky that you will find yourself having strange dreams for weeks to come after listening to this. while certainly not phish's most easy listening, or radio friendly cd (i realize they are as far from radio friendly as could be), this may be their most defining one. to try to define musical influences on this cd would be like trying to look bassist mike gordon in the face and not laugh. definitely buy it....at worst you'll have something considered inferior to a weird al christmas album, at best you'll have the best cd in your entire collection."
5,phish: mozart for the rock generation,I personaly dont think phish could ever go wrong and maybe its because they allow themselves that freedom. but this album in particular interests me because it takes me back to childhood and feeling good and about probably nothing at all. it couldnt ever hurt anyone to be happy for no reason! but as i heard it said once and i'll repeat it for all to hear... phish is like icecream for the ears!
4,So its a silly one... get over it!!!,"Yeah ok so this is not the best Phish studio realease but if you open your ears a little Lawn Boy is a fun little ditty to have around. Phish has proven to be quite versatile through the years and that makes them a choice rock act. Lawn Boy is full of that vesatility that only Phish can convey. A must have!!!Highlights include Split Open And Melt(a classic in live format), Bouncing Around The Room(also a live classic), the siily but fun My Sweet One, Run Like An Antelope, the peculiar and quirky Bathtub Gin and The Squirming Coil.Not a cd for first time Phishers but a cd not to be missed. ENJOY!!!!!"
2,Bad versions of good songs...,"TSIA. This album contains some of Phish's finest songs in their career. Such wonderful tunes as ""REBA"" and ""squirming coil"" which are a delight to hear live are here rendered as lifeless, unfocused, energyless rot. Now I have a feeling that I may get some flack for this someday but can anyone who has heard any of these songs live truly say that the studio tracks come even close? PHISH's first two albums are dull, musaky, and low-energy, partially because they hadn't figred out how to use a studio yet, they just tried to recreate their live performance. If only they had learned what they learned by ""billy breathes"" and applied it to the songs on this album, the album woudl be outstanding, but the result here is almost unlistenable. Check out the bootlegs for the real stuff, kids."
4,Heavy writings,"One of the premier jam band's more adventurous studio offerings, with a fascinating set of exploratory dynamics, is not without its overreaching moments but should still retain its must-own status simply from how much compositional zest lies inside."
4,"good album,but should not be your first","this cd is great, but not outstanding phish.classic tunes that are not played to their full potental. there is better phish out there. picture of nectar explores all different kinds of styles that phish can play.Junta is also a must for any phish fan that is looking for a great studio album."
5,Perfect Go-To Guide for Carb Counts,"This book is very comprehensive and I have yet to look something up and not find it -- all the various ways you can serve a particular type of food. Also included pre-packaged, brand dinners and fast food restaurant foods. I use mine daily for tracking my carb intake. I like the size because it is small and doesnt take up room in my kitchen, and I can easily travel with it."
1,Book lacks sufficient information,"Save your money and buy Netzer's Encyclopedia of Food Values: this book appears to be merely an extract from the larger work. You will receive four or five times as much information, although you still won't have dietary fiber information. The problem with Netzer's Carbohydrate Counter is that it neglects to break the carbohydrate gram count into its nutritional carbohydrate and dietary fiber carbohydrate components. That makes this book useless for those people whose nutritional needs require that information. This book simply gives total carbohydrate counts and says ""Th-th-th-that's all, folks."""
1,"Good, but could be better: what about fiber or roughage?","The book appears to give comprehensive coverage in terms of the number and type of entries included. However, on the Atkins diet, the important measure to monitor is the ""active"" carbohydrate mass which may metabolised and which excludes roughage or fiber. The inclusion of such a measure in the book would greatly enhance its value and utility."
4,Informative,The book was full of all the information on food you will need.I found that reading the carb counts and fat contents of different foodshas really changed my diet.
4,Great book of Literacy Related Assessments,This book is worth having in every teacher's library. It provides literacy assessments and they what and why's that go along with them. I will be keeping this book as a future resource in my classroom.
3,"Too slow, and too many hokey foreign accents","The idea was interesting, but the story moved much too slowly. And the foreign accents were annoying and stereotypical. The Spanish-speaking head of the United Nations, for example, constantly interspersed his conversation with references to tacos and enchiladas (oh, brother). His Russian-speaking security agent talked about, what else, vodka and Russian ballet. The author even used these ridiculous cultural references when talking ABOUT the characters. For example, he said the UN chief was about to burst ""like a pinata"". In my opionion, this is a cheap way to avoid creating real, 3-dimensional characters."
4,Extremely absorbing and entertaining!,"I found this, Stephen Burns second novel, to be not as intellectually compelling as his most excellent ""Flesh And Silver"", but a most enjoyable and exciting adventure nonetheless.A typical good guys vs the bad guys story, the good guys here are a group of six humans who are interrupted in their complex lives by a mentally deafening call for help that just can't be ignored. The bad guys are all the rest who don't hear the call and can't believe their stories of an alien presence in dire need.I loved the characters and the characterization. Burns really brought them all to vivid and interesting life and compelled me to avidly follow their progress towards a noble and world changing goal.This is only a mild social statement, not much science in the fiction, but it is a darn good read that started out a bit slow and then came to a screaming finish. A great feeling of aaaahhhhh at the end.Try it, you'll really like it!"
2,Childish.,"I found the characters to be both superficial and extremely unreliable. The dialogs are very disappointing, often shallow and unsophisticated. Unfortunately -so is the plot."
5,Nice Fit,"This brand of boxer briefs are very comfortable and fit very well, even though I don't work out as much as these underwear models. I plan on buying more of these as they are the best fit of the 4 or 5 different brands that I've bought in the past."
5,My hubby loves these!,"These not only look good (and i mean good) but hold everything comfortably in place, which makes these great for guys working construction or that do alot physically like working out etc. Also they are great if you have epididimitus or your balls just hurt. They are thick and comfortable too. My husband wants me to buy him 3 more pairs and he already has 3 pairs!"
5,Starnes Greatest Hit,I have this on cassette tape and was hoping to upgrade to CD. Sadly it is not available. John Starnes had the best tenor voice in Christian music and this was the best of his albums.
3,Fun at the beginning but boring later on,This game was fun at the beginning but gets boring later on. The game is not very accurate and the reload feature of this game is tedious as you have to push button every time and gun is bit heavy.
2,Dont Bother,"Game is alright, but is plagued by a horrid setup requiring corded sensors strung across one's television. The gun itself is unbalanced, awkward, and simply ugly. The game gets dull after the first few minutes of playing and simply never picks back up."
4,A Fun Time,Time Crisis 4 has plenty of action and excitement enough to keep you intrigued for a long time.
4,Cool game,"Overall good game, the multiplayer feature is cool. Really two games in one since you have arcade mode. Might be a little on the easy side - completed the arcade mode in a few days. The led sensors are not long enough for a 46 inch TV - good for small TV sets."
3,Time Crisis 4 w/ Guncon,"Well for starters, light guns haven't really come a long way since duck hunt. Although they claim it's more accurate since it comes with 2 sensors to put on your TV kind of like the Wii's sensor bar. The game is the same as the arcade version but a lot cheaper to play (ha ha ha). I quickly lost interest and the Guncon 3 controller was cheaply made, but it was fun and would be best fr two player (unfortunately the controllers are hard to find seperately!)."
4,Great game!,"I bought this game for my husband and I ended up playing it more than he did!! It is so much fun with the gun controller and sensors that go on the tv. It is a little tedious to set up, and the arcade part of the game doesn't have cross hairs which would make it so much easier to get an accurate shot. Despite those two small complaints, this game is fun!"
3,The gun is cool,"The game is ok. graphics are great, but you can only continue 4 times. The extra games, target practice type mini games are fun and easily the best part of this game. It was a gold box deal for 50.00, which is the only reason I bought. It is not worth 80. If they come out with more gun based games then it may be worth buying. The gun is extremly accurate esp when you use the 5 point calibration...don't worry it takes all of 10 seconds. if you love gun based games this may be worth it for you. If not, it is not worth the money."
3,"Good game, lousy controller.","Ordered the game as a gift for a friend and he brought over his PS3 and we played it. The game looks great, and is just like the arcade game.However, the light gun controller is WIRED, which I didn't realize. The cord is 10-15ft, but that's still pretty close if you have a big TV. Also, you have to add some WIRED transmitters to your TV in order for the light gun to work. So that's two ugly wires coming out of your PS3, one to the TV and one to your remote.Also, I found the gun very unergnomic. My hand hurt after 5-10 mins of play.Overall, I'd say this game is still worth buying if you get a good deal on it--but it ain't great."
3,Time crisis,I have enjoyed playing this game so far. The action is great and using the gun works much better than the controler.
4,Good.,"its a fun game, but a little confusing at first but then you get the hang of it. graphics i feel could of been a lot better. i consider it a hassle to aim the gun every time you play or having to set up the infrared sensors. The gun is not cordless whitch was not appealing, together with the gun color(bright orange). other than that is a fun game to play."
3,old game better graphics,this game was ok but nothing inovative about it and got bored of playing it after a couple of times. i bought it for 49 dollars on a GB special and got about my money's worth back as a tradin at a local buy sell and trade store. overall atleast i didn't waste my money on it.
2,Superficial and short-lived.,"If you think that playing this game will fulfill any of your overly nostalgic memories of playing Time Crisis at the local Golfland, then you'd be sadly mistaken. The gun does not seem very accurate, and has somewhat of a lag time between where you aim it on the screen and where the reticle appears. Plus the arcade-shooting portion of the game is very, very short. The added FPS mode is insipid, and feels like it was just tacked on to make this a complete game. All-in-all, just a two-star product. I would only purchase this if Amazon (which is rockingly awesome) had it for about $30 again."
5,Muy buena musica Very good Music,Esta muy bueno este CD creo que es uno de los mejores grupos de Rock en Español vale la pena comprarlo
2,boring stuff,"before you buy this poor cd you have to buy cathedral-""forest of equilibrium"" and winter -""into darkness"" which are what this band is trying to be .be wise .smoke a lot.know what good music is."
1,omg this is the sort of stuff that gives rock a bad name,Absolutely awful doooooooom rock. Though I guess if your into talentless doooooooom then this is for you. Comparing this to Sabbath is like comparing chalk to cheese. One is heavy music arranged around classic melodic tunes (Sabbath) and the other is a collection of out of tune riffs that seem to go on forever without any thought for something called melody (Wizard).Avoid like the plague.
2,Negative attitudes,The album is very negative saying hoping the world will f**** die and so on. Very hard album to as a whole listen to. I liked doom mantia and is why I bought the album. But the whole album has one song with a great riff in the middle that continues almost like one of Fu manchu's songs on the album In Search Of... The songs are very long 8 minutes or so and my not being stoned listening to the album left me to fast forward much of the album and looking for parts I really liked.
4,This review is on the 1st cd by itself.,"After countless listens to Dopethrone, I decided to check out the rest of Electric Wizard's catalog. I first heard some songs off Let Us Prey, and was dissapointed. I like the album now however. So, I decided to check out their earlier albums. Come My Fanatics is pretty much in the same vein as Dopethrone. Bass-heavy production, killer riffs, weird ambiences, etc. I like Dopethrone a lot more though. The best songs are Return Trip, which is now my favorite Electric Wizard song, and Wizard In Black, which has some great riffs and killer guitar solos. The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because of Jus's singing. It can get annoying after a while, and I didn't really care for Doom-Mantia. On the whole, 4 stars."
3,not exactly electric,"I remember when this band first came out- everyone was like ""This is the ultimate heavy rock band for Black Sabbath fans"". Well guess what? I'm a HUGE Sabbath fan, but this music is not anything like Black Sabbath as far as memorable guitar riffs, tricky tempo changes, and incredible instrumental skills are concerned. This is just a very very obvious attempt to be exactly like the legendary Black Sabbath (though granted, the band DOES do a good job ""sounding"" like Black Sabbath without being as good of course).Electric Wizard just doesn't have the talent to write memorable guitar riffs that Black Sabbath did so well on those classic early 70's albums, and to be honest, it doesn't even impress me very much that bands are able to copy that guitar tone Tony Iommi invented, because let's face it- any band can sound like that these days.But there ARE a few decent moments on the album so I can forgive them for their obvious attempt to be the next Black Sabbath."
3,Tmobile Dash Clear snap on case,This a great item for your dash as far as protection and carrying convenience. My only issue is that it frequently came out of the snap on case.I taped in on and have had no problems! good item!
3,"I love the cookies, but my order were about to expire and were stale","I love, love, love the Cinnamon Graham Alphabet Cookies. They are hard to find in the stores, and the one place I always could find them is no longer carrying them. So, I bought a Pack of 12. Unfortunately, they were just about to expire, and they were stale. My husband and son ate them anyway, but I was disappointed. I would be nervous about ordering them again. Pity, because when they are fresh, they are 5-star cookies."
4,Don't let the organic & healthy image scare you,"Though resembling nothing like the common graham crackers found in most grocer's cookie aisle, these small squares are quite delectable and relatively guilt-free."
5,Addictive little morsels!,"I have fallen in love with these cookies!They taste almost the same as Newman's sandwich cookies, just without the filling. Crunchy, chocolaty, and just the perfect size. And at 120 calories for a serving, they aren't too waist enhancing.The main reason I am in love with them is the fact that they don't have any corn in them (I'm allergic to corn). This is something that not too many cookie makers consider when making their products.Yet another Newman's Own product to add to our ever growing pantry of products.Pros:Chocolaty enough to satisfy chocoholics.Crunchy and have a good texture.Cons:Far too many Qs and not enough vowels, it's like playing Scrabble! :P"
5,Awesomely Delicious!,These are by far thee best organic cookies out there!!! And not too high calorie for 10 of them per serving!!
2,ok,"I wasnt impressed with these and neither were my kids. I ended up giving them away. Not bad, realy, just not particularly good or worth wasting the calories on..."
4,"An informed and accurate text, the other reviewer is wrong","Don't listen to the guy who gave this book only one star. The research carried out by the author is accurate and correct. Columbus did in fact re-introduce the horse (inadvertently)to North America. If you're really that curious about it all then read 'The Nature of Horses'. I forget the name of the author but it is a first-class scientific account of the evolution of the horse and its escape from extinction by domestication (yes it's true, if we didn't enjoy giddy-upping so much on the backs of horses or getting them to pull stuff there would be no more of the majestic creatures around!). What the previous reviewer mistook as propaganda is actually the product of sound archaeology and zoology. There you have it, straight from the horses..."
1,Another Save the Wild Horses Book!!!,Why does it seem that the horse story get's twisted into the youth of this country. This is More Propaganda to save the wild horses. I am tired of this agenda being fed to my children
3,one more from the seru giran days,"A greatest hits collection from his days with Seru Giran, where together with Aznar and the rest created some great music, to the extreme of getting their group to be known as the argentinian beatles. But there's been enough records from those days already, and if that was the idea the album should bear the name of Seru Giran and not Charly's because it's confusing. Of course here are some classics like the title song, eiti leda and viernes 3 am, perhaps the best rock song ever written in spanish. So his genius is here as usual, and if you are looking for a compilation of material from that period or are getting to know the greatest southamerican rocker ever, this will help as an introduction. But if you thought this could be new material beware: it is not. And if you want some greatest hits collection better get one of his solo years which are certainly his best."
4,"Excellent recipes, but cumbersome.","This book is fabulous. When I don't know where to start with a recipe, I see if there's something in here, and I'm never disapppointed. My only complaint is that it is more of a coffee table book - I can't keep it in my kitchen because I don't have enough counter space for it...and running back and forth makes it tricky when I'm trying to cook. Would love it if they'd come out with a slightly smaller version that's more kitchen counter-friendly."
5,Great reference,This book has a detailed history of the origins of cajun and creole food and many great recipes. I would recommend it highly.
1,This book is a fraud,"It is filled with totally false historical information such as this: ""Marie Laveau was the voodoo queen of Bourbon Street. Legend has it that the pirate Jean Lafitte often met Marie at the Old Absinthe House late in the evening where they enjoyed oysters on the half shell while trading secrets of Barataria Bay.""1. Marie Laveau had nothing to do with Bourbon Street.2. Jean Lafitte disappeared from Louisiana around 1820, when Marie Laveau was an adolescent.3. The Old Absinthe House wasn't in existence when Laveau and Lafitte were alive.4. Marie Laveau never had a reason to go to Barataria Bay. She practiced voodoo in New Orleans."
5,Favorite non-fiction book I own and a great cookbook.,"I was born and reared in New Orleans. I live out of state now - this book to me is like a kid's teddy bear - brings pangs of nostalgia for the food/culture I love, yet it is so vast that I find interesting things in it that I've not known before. A fabulous cookbook and I have many about Cajun/Creole foods, historical, beautiful, a comprehensive book that anyone who loves Louisiana would be a ecstatic to own. No better gift for a homesick person from South Louisiana. It warrants living on my coffee table when I'm not using it - furthermore, it is appropriately sized for that honor. The cover is misleading, while it is unique, unlike the cover the book inside is colorful, beautiful, impressive and so interesting.I found it on Barnes & Nobles website for $26 - wow did I luck out.Now that I have it, I realize it is worth every penny of the higher price it carries every where else. A masterpiece."
5,great book,"This is one of the best cookbooks I own! Not only does it have great recipies, it also contains a total history of the area and the type food within this book."
5,Louisiana Cuisine Personified,"My co-worker received one of these books for a wedding gift. Three other people at work ordered it after looking through the wonderful, mouth-watering recipes, the beautiful historical and contemporary photographs and after reading the informative history of our cuisine! As a Louisianian who really enjoys cooking, I was most impressed! Cudos to John Folse and to Amazon for making this wonderful book available."
5,Great for my staff laptop T60s!,An all in one adapter. This works great for a dead laptop that I need to pull data off the hard drive.
2,usb hard drive adapter,used 1 time. the connector was bent upon arrival and had to be bent back in to shape to properly connect to the hard drive pins. I would say the cord is pore. the power supply would not power up the 2nd time i went to use the adapter. (still on the first day) I would not recommend buying this particular adapter.
3,Review of HD adapter,Over all the product is fine. It was received with a bad connection on the power plug side. The connector was not firmly seated in the plug. I've used this same device that was purchased at an electronics wholesale dealer and the quality of that device was better. I would probably purchase this item from a different vendor the next time.
1,Waste Of Money,"I bought this product last week ( 6/17/2012) The Ide works great, but the Sata is junk. I can only assume that the usb does not provide enough power to support a Sata drive. Do not waste your time or money on this. Spend a little extra cash on a Acronis adapter."
2,poor construction,"I am on my second adapter. On the first one, one of the wires for the IDE power plug came loose. They were very good about replacing the unit. On the second one the plug that fits into the ac power adapter is loose and I have to hold it so the power to the drive stays on. On both units the pins for the IDE to SATA power converter are loose and wiggle around making it hard to fit into the power cord. Overall I would say that this product is poorly made. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Sata- No problem,This product works on Serial drives. I recovered data from an OS corrupt boot sector ATA-150 2.5 hard drive. I didn't even have to use the CD. Plugged in the drive- it showed up as a new local drive and I copied the data. A must have for every IT person- it will save you a lot of time.
4,Period Piece That Still Works,"Uprisings would have earned 5 stars from me, but I do recommend this with a caveat that not all of the recipes work out all of the time. Most do, however, and those ingredients that may have seemed exotic back when are now available in most supermarkets or your local health food emporium. I continue to bake out of Uprisings, but I also love to read it because it's a great way to revisit the 1960s and 70s--a ""you are there"" type of experience. It is so very earnest."
3,"Promising, but doesn't deliver.","I ordered the book because I like to bake, and thought it would be informative. UPRISINGS is informative, but it's one of those books that beats an idealogical drum. I actually agree with the authors that Americans eat too much meat, but I don't believe that if we all became vegetarians, the extra grain would be automatically shipped to starving people in other nations. It's not that simple. Also, not matter how you use it, carob does not substitute for chocolate"
5,Atari simplicity at its finest,"It's a really simple concept--you fly your biplane through barns for points and try to avoid crashing into things. But it's harder than it sounds, and after you finish a game, you find yourself wanting to play just one more time, and the next thing you know, you've played 14 more times.Like all the best Atari 2600 games, this one takes 30 seconds to learn, but much, much longer to master."
3,Die Cast toy Lexus,"I ordered a silver Lexus LS 430 , the Vendor sent me a white one instead, I asked for a replacement, never heard from the Vendor, so I would rate the Vendor service as poor. The diecast model is decent for the price, certain parts like the interior rearview mirror is not to scale."
1,BEWARE OF THE PHOTO!!!,"This item popped up when I searched ""chord harmonica"". The picture in the add is, in fact, a Hohner multi-chord harmonica which sells for around $1,000 or more.What is being sold is a standard CHROMATIC HARMONICS.Do not be misled!!"
2,This book doesn't contain the plays.....,which is something that it failed to mention. I was very disappointed in the fact that all it contains is a critique of O'Casey and the plays.Don't buy this book if you are looking for the plays.
2,What happened?,"First of all, i really like Rk, but this ending was weak. After the Kyoto arc, the series bombed out. When i finished watching the last episode, i said, ""what?! that's it. what kind of ending is that???"" They don't even tell you what happens to the characters and whether or not Kauru and Kenshin ever get together. that really made me mad. i would suggest viewers buy the kyoto arc and finish there. it would be a waste of perfectly good money to by these last episodes. just rent them or something....you'll regret buying these unless you are an upmost devoted RK fan. Overall it was very diappointing watching my favorite series end this way."
4,Jenny Shaffer,I liked it very much. I read the manga and i have reflection. the ending was very good and it showed cllips form the koyto arc. you can see that kenshin has Feeling for karou in this one and he dose show it. you can Either read the manga or you can wacth end song and reflection But no matter what anyone says this was a good ending to kenshin. i hope that kenshin and the gang will live in your hearts as whlie as mine
2,a disapointing end to an awesome series.,"I love rurouni kenshin. I loved the tokyo, and the kyoto arcs. I even liked the christian, and the black night stories (what can i say, im a sucker for romance). But this is just plain lame. Im not going to restate the story because everyone already has. But magical feung shuei people are one of the lamest ideas for villans, i wish that they would have ended w/ the black knight story so i wouldent have been so dissapionted.Another good idea for the last 5 episodes would have been good old fashioned funny kenshin episodes. I would recomend this for hardcore fans of kenshin, like myself, just dont expect to be wowed in the end."
3,Hey You Spoilers!,"Thanks Luna and Stephanie (down below) who totally gave away the story line to the DVD! Sheesh. Well they dfo have a point, this all and all wasn't really great...but my little brother seemed to like it. sheesh."
4,weird ending.,"I first have to say that Rurouni Kenshin is one of the greatest anime series ever. All of them were good the ova's samurai x were good, the wandering samurai arc and the legend of kyoto arc were perfect, even the motion picture was good. But I was not completly sure about the tales of the meiji arc it looked sort of weird and confusing but it was still rurouni kenshin and I respected that. There are five episodes in this DVD and all of them were good but weird and confusing. My favorite episode is the last one with Kenshin and Kaoru stuck together that was a pretty good episode because again it shows how much Kaoru cares for Kenshin. I don't really think that this is the last episode I mean I think that they are still dubbing the other arc that was supposed to come out the ""Jinchu arc"" because the real episode is when Kenshin and Kaoru were supposed to get married and have a son named Kenji.If anyone happen's to know if anymore kenshin arcs coming out in the future please contact me."
4,"If you like Webb Wilder or Jason and the Scorchers, or Cheap Trick, you'll love these guys!","Outstanding 20 cut sollection ofa band that has undergone many per-sonnel changes over the years. I sawthem live twice here in Virginia andthey are very good, though they didn'thave the original memebers still, then.Pick Up On It!"
4,Good compilation!,"This is a good compliation of the Satellites. But where you need to start is with ""In The Land of Salvation and Sin"" record and go from there. That is an all time classic of rock and roll. This has tastes from that record, but you need more than an appetizer!"
5,Great Tool,"This is the best solution I've used for an all-in-one oil filter wrench (although you actually need 2 to cover the majority of sizes). It works only to loosen, not to tighten - and of course you'd never want to tighten an oil filter with a tool anyway. Very nice.Note that this is listed on Amazon at least twice, and one is priced almost three times as much as the other."
4,Excellent Oil Filter Remover,"I was disappointed when I found the location of the oil filter in my Toyota Highlander. The filter was in a location that it was nearly impossible to get enough force to turn it to take it off for an oil change. Luckily, I researched on amazon and found this awesome item. This wrench hooks up to a rachet and will easily remove an oil filter even in those hard to reach locations. The key is that this wrench gets tighter and tighter as it is turned and will dig into the filter allowing for enough of a grip to turn it easily.I found this to be helpful as well when I changed the oil on my Yamaha FZ1 motorcycle for the first time. I would not have been able to get the factory oil filter off without the wrench because not only was the filter on really tight, but it was also in a small, hard to reach location.Highly recommended!"
4,"should work on any spin on filet, but...","it does not work for canister style filters like on the new 4 runner. I think the tool is very well built but if you know the exact diameter (mm) of your filter you would be better off buying the exact size than a ""one size fits all"" tool."
3,for open but not for installation.,"maybe i wasn't really read through the item description.this wrench only for open an oil filter, but not for tighten it."
3,"Good for removing, NOT for installing","I bought this style tool or the same one from my local auto parts store: The tool works great for removing, grips the filter well and comes right off. However, when installing an oil filter, the corners of the gripping area that grabs onto the side of the filter tend to dig into the filter casing. For me this resulted in weakening the wall of one of my filters and eventually it started leaking. If you do use it for installing your filters I'd recommend putting something soft in between the tool and the filter to prevent damage/denting, and also be careful of how hard you torque it.I keep the tool for removal if I don't care about damaging the filter. From now on I only hand-tighten my oil filters when installing them myself, and I haven't had a leak since."
1,Good looking but useless,"This wrench is not working at all. When I got it, I figure that I need to buy a handle, then I tried the handle together with this wrench. Guess what? I can only unlock the filter and couldn't lock it....? The people in the auto parts store, laugh out loud at me....after i told them how how I paid for it. The expense to send it back can let me buy a useful one from the store. .....VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1,Didn't get the same tool,I didn't even get the right tool. I got some crapy chinese one that is totaly different. give me the right one
5,Great first impression,"I was getting frustrated having trouble getting the filter off my Honda Element. Read the good reviews on this wrench and was not disappointed. Got it off on second try, without much effort.Only complaint is with the moving parts it is hard to clean if you happen to drop it in the full oil pan like I did, haha....but I will just be sure not to make that mistake again. Not the product's fault. :)"
3,It works!,It works! but it's not a wonder tool I thought I was getting. It's not easy to manipulate with one hand lying flat on your back under the car.
5,Best filter tool ever,"From the moment I saw it, I knew it would work great and it did. I've tried every other one out there but none works in the tight space of my Toyota Glanza Turbo. This tool made life so easy to change my filter now, totally lover it"
1,WASTE of money,"Purchased the item after reading so many good reviews. Ordered the item and received a totally different product than the one picture here. The items doesnt grab the filter head properly, already tried with my VT 600 oil filter and my RX 330 and nothing.Dont waste your money. This one is going right back to amazon.If I could give half a star I will do it"
2,"Nina Simone for ""Nice, White Folks""","Just NOT Nina at her best. The best way to decsribe it is ""over arranged"". Very bland and schmaltzy, strings and all. It is as if she had an appearance booked for the the Pat Boone show and the record company wanted her to have something to promote that would go down well with that type of audience. She really never gets to dig in and do what she does best."
1,Too hard even for an adult,"The sounds for each pair of matching boxes were all too similar and the matching box sounds didn't even match. The matching pair sounds were similar, but the pitches did not match. It was very fustrating to think you found a match and did not (perhaps the color codes on the bottom were wrong?). I had a couple of other adults try the toy out and they too had the same problem. I am returning this item. Very disappointed."
1,Way too difficult!,"I bought this for my pre-school classroom, and my oh my, do I regret that purchase! The sounds are all so similar, that not even the adults in my classroom could figure it out, no less the kids! It's a neat idea, but the company really needs to work on differentiating the sounds."
1,Sounds do not match at all!!,"I just received this soundbox. The sounds for boxes that ARE supposed to match DO NOT, and the sounds for different boxes that ARE NOT supposed to match DO. Kind of surprised as this is not rocket science.This product, I should add, is well made. The boxes are sturdy, light, and easy for small hands to hold onto. Both my 2.5 yo and my 9 month old enjoyed picking up and rattling the boxes. However, it still does not do what it says it does, match sounds and then be able to check your performance by color matching.It's going right back from where it came!"
2,A Tough Read,"I found How to Start a Magazine by James Kobak difficult to read and somewhat depressing. The promises on the cover, in my humble opinion, we never fulfilled and the textbook-style format was flat. I felt as if, rather than a telling me ""how to"" he was telling me all the reasons ""not to."" He also came from only one perspective--that of a large scale, national publication. My goal is to build a local business-builder magazine. Therefore, much of the information was irrelevant for me. Based on the cover promises, I thought I'd found the ideal book for my needs. It didn't deliver."
1,Review of The Teutonic Knights,I am surprised that this badly written and researched book can be described as serious history. It appears to me to be a piece of vanity publishing. I would not even recommend it on an elementary school level. I was very disapointed.
5,Kick back and relax...with waterworks,"What do you get when you add up skilled musicians, outstanding song writing and superb production? The answer is, of course, dragonfly. Kick back and relax and let waterworks take you on a mellow musical journey..."
4,A collection of short stories,"This volume is a collection of short stories set over various parts of Gordainius the finders career. Some are good, some are kind of ho-hum, but all are interesting. One feels that Mr. Saylor is filling in gaps and tying up the package. I don't know, after his last full length novel about this ancient roman detective, how he will continue. The main character and personal and detective interactions are as good as always. It is an enjoyable read, and perhaps with short stories, the saving grace is that you CAN put it down between stories and actually get something accomplished...like housework or supper...instead of wanting to read on and on to find out what happens next."
4,A Decent Collection of Ancient Mystery Yarns,"This book is an anthology of short mystery tales set over various points of the career of Gordianus the Finder The quality of these stories range from the excellent to the above average. In these stories, Saylor expands on the life story and personality of the magnificent Roman detective. Given the fact that the Gordianus stories are better than the novels, one can only hope that Saylor finds the time to write more. Gordianus is definitely in his element in these fascinating tales of mystery and wonder as he plumbs the depths of the late Roman Republic."
5,"Splendid fillers to the ""Roma sub Rosa""","This collection of stories is a fine set of historical mysteries in its own right. Saylor is a wonderful writer, and the historical research is meticulous, and cleverly worked into the stories. But, for me, the greatest interest is fitting these stories into the career of his detective, Gordianus the Finder. The later career of Gordianus is covered in some detail in Saylor's novels, but there were gaps in the earlier part of his life which these tales illuminate. The author has created a memorable set of characters, and I am mightily glad to learn more about them."
5,A handful of refreshing short stories,"I'm a big fan of the Gordianus the Finder novels. I've gone out of my way to read every one of them in the series.However, these short stories are even _better_ than the novels. Maybe it's because Saylor doesn't have to construct a complex plot, or set a stage with myriad characters. He's able to focus on the storytelling, with enough historical detail to give the stories a sense of versimilitude. As a result, the tales are lighter... and you don't have to feel as though your mind has to be sharp to enjoy the stories.As with any such collection, some of the short stories work better than do others, but none of them are clinkers.Despite my effusive praise, I'd recommend that a newcomer to Gordianus read one of the novels first. Doing so will give a bit more backbone to the world Saylor writes about.But overall: Lovely, entertaining stories. Grab it."
3,Roman Finder,"This is a book of short stories about Gordianus the Finder which take place in the time of Cicero, Cato, and other notable Romans. The stories are interesting in themselves, but they also give us in insight into how the early Romans lived.Anyone who likes history will find interesting historic anecdotes in this book."
4,A Lost Gem?,You can scour the shelves of music stores these days and for hours never find anything fresh.Listening to Junta is like walking in an open-air market; nothing should blend together but everything does. From a circus ballad in a calliope beat to wandering instrumentals the music on Junta all fits beautifully.It's unique and worth a buy.
2,Don't Buy This CD,"Okay, maybe I made a mistake buying Junta. Not being a Phish fan, I figured I'd expand my horizons and buy their first CD to find out why this group got so damned popular. What I found was a rambling mess of medicore musicianship and really (I mean REALLY) stupid songs. What bothers me most about Phish is that they're such a Grateful Dead ripoff it makes me sick. By the way, The Dead were much better musicians and Garcia wrote better songs. I'll give Junta another listen but I fear it's destined to be traded or sold. But before I do, I better dust off my bong...just to be sure."
4,Came out swimming,"Certainly the adventurous jammer's zaniest noodling, and one of the more impressive rock debuts in general. The band was already brimming with a technical prowess so lethal they hardly knew what to do with all the energy."
3,so comfy but too slippery,"Great boots- I always wear LaCrosse for work and these live up to their standards of comfort, BUT they were way too slippery so I had to send them back."
3,Inferior Replacement Boot,These boots were a replacement for a similiar pair that were six years old. The new boots are not the same quality. No felt lining and a VERY limp upper portion of boot make this a marginal replacement to my old pair. Still a good ankle fit which is important for walking especially for a hunter.
2,"Before moving production to communist China,","I was able to get a full two years out of this boot. Now, at about 6 months they start to develop cracks around the ankles and at 7 months they leak in ankle deep water. I wear rubber boots in the fields every day, 365 days a year. in the summer, I take them off after the dew is off the grass, and I wear them any time I'm outside working the cattle or such. So I need a boot that will last. But regretfully, this isn't the boot I'm after. They raised the price, and used cheaper materials i suppose. I'd be willing to pay more for a better boot. But where can we find a USA made rubber ankle fit boot today? I'm very disappointed."
4,Dry warm feet.,"I got these boots for running my trap line.they are confortable,light,and keep my feet dry. I will recommend these to my friends."
1,garbage,Don't waste your money these boots SUCK! I have owned a pair for a month and now a stick has went through the top of the toes (where your metatarsels would be)! Rendering them the most expensive piece of s*** I've ever bought! As a duck hunter I wouldn't recommend these boots for anything. Lacrosse 2 thumbs down!
4,Excellent,"There's more to this man, Ty Cobb, than just baseball and Mr. Alexander did a good job with his background, as well as the details of the game during Mr. Cobb's playing days."
4,Ty Cobb,"I enjoyed the book very much. I had always heard that Cobb was an arrogant SOB but I learned that he was not only arrogant but very intelligent along with it. Innuendos made about his honesty, I think, were unfounded. He had his likes and dislikes but his passion rested with baseball and with excellence --- and with the celebrity that followed him for all of his career. Quite a man in my opinion but extremely hard to get along with. There was only one way to do anything --- and that was his way. Not much different than what it is with any successful business man in today's world."
5,"Well researched, entertaining","I have read several Cobb biographies-this is the best. Alexander is thorough, accurate and entertaining. If you're interested in Ty Cobb and are only going to read one biography, read this one. Highly recommended."
1,Too Difficult to get Into,"This novel is written in third person present tense (like reading stage directions) with a fly on the wall perspective. I made it through three family dinners where the family intermittedly discusses the possiblity that their possibly just overly flamboyant mother may be insane and social philosophy (all the while bemoaning the position that most of the middle classes and superior cannot truly divest themselves of their self importance enough to discuss it objectively).The third dinner was all that I could take and I quit about a hundred pages in. This won the Los Angeles Times award so it's somebody's bag, but not mine. I found absolutely no resemblance between Drabble's writing style and Dickens', as has been suggested. I can think of no other author to compare it to except possibly Fitzgerald or Conrad (without the descriptiveness)."
2,Now i REALLY want to go visit England,"If i worked in the British Tourist Office, this book would be in the ""Never Recommend this Book to a Prospective Tourist"" list. The characters are despicable. The Witch, Frieda, is the most endearing character of all, and that is sad. Although she did a horrible job raising her children, she acknowledges no responsibility for how screwed up they came up to be. Ha! She plays both sides of the deck, claiming to be ""green"" and then profiting from industries that destroy the environment. Her son-in-law is a pretty boy politician, her favorite grandson has been brainwashed to believe he is the cat's meow, her own son is a self-important idiot who can't see beyond his own nose... Read it if you want to feel relieved at how your own family is not that bad after all."
1,Don't waste your time,"Margaret Drabble is guilty of self-indulgent dribble. Her characters are lifeless at best and her story tiresome. The dialogue is unnatural, her descriptions needlessly wordy."
5,"Azaleas, Revised and Enlarged Edition by Frfed C. Galle","..........................I located ""Azaleas, Revised and Enlarged Edition by Fred C. Galley"" through Amazon.com and purchased it. This book is fascinating, it contains more information than I can ever use. It includes for hundreds of azaleas their names, color desriptions, seasons, origins, and more. There are color plates, sketches of petal shapes and petal markings which I had not seen before. When I open the book, I don't want to put it down."
5,Gift,"This was a gift I gave at Christmas, the person who received it thought it was a very helpful DVD."
1,Trapped in the Sixties,"This is just a terrible album. I purchased the original vinyl and didn't like it (except for ""Comin' Home Baby). Because it's bundled with the ""Pele"" and ""In Person at El Matador,"" I ended up with the CD. I gave it a listen, but I still hate it. Mushy 60s-style string-pop-funk arrangements just overwhelm Sergio's crisp piano styling. Go with ""Swinger from Rio"" and ""Beat of Brazil"" to hear Sergio at his best. Even the badly recorded ""Mas Que Nada"" is a better example of his combo playing."
3,headband,"It is a headband like any other, nothing special or unique about it. Just bought it online for a globetrotters basketball game I was in. More color options on amazon than at the store."
4,Lucky to find it!,"I am so happy I found this CD for my 12 year old daughter. She really doesn't like Brittany Spear, only this song. I always shop on Amazon.com so I turned here. Now my daughter loves it she listens to it all the time! So I hope this review helped you especially because it is getting closer to Christmas!"
3,Still 50/50,"I cant fully support Dr. Neal Bernard. His thought is to eat a TON of oatmeal in the am should sustain you till lunch etc etc. I just cant agree. So many dieters out there know that in order to not overeat you must eat several small meals in a day. And if you ever tried to eat THAT much oatmeal, even if you pull it through it will leave you starving by lunch. He makes some good points, getting alot of fruit and veggies and less meat will get you healthier. But to me going completely vegan and eating even more processed foods like soy burgers, soy milk etc isnt going to completely cover you. Sorry. It was an ok read."
2,Clever Title,"The title of this book was cleverly chosen. Had it been more descriptive, I don't think I would have purchased the book. The bottom line from reading this is that one needs to become a Vegan in order to truly break the food seduction cycle. Not really any other alternatives in the view of the Dr. While the information was interesting and yes I will try to eat more fruits and vegetables, I can't commit to a true vegan lifestyle. I was hoping for some simple common sense tips on how to break food seduction habits without such a radical change in diet."
3,Vegan vague,"An interesting read, but don't expect to benefit from anything in it unless you are willing to completely give up all meat, fish and dairy products, for LIFE. Dr. Barnard does not endorse moderation, it's all or nothing here. For those who are willing to embrace this lifestyle, the final third of the book is full of delicious homemade vegan recipes."
2,Mostly a vegan proselytizing book,"Could you lose weight this way? Yes, but the book reads much more like a call to a vegan diet than help with weight loss."
3,same information as so many other books,"This book was a fast read, and mainly talked about a low GI diet. Somehow I was hoping to hear something new and different from other books I have read.It was worth the read."
3,Not what I expected,The first few chapters in this book were very informative. It gave a lot of information about why we crave certain foods. But ultimatley this book endorses a vegan diet. The title of this book was misleading in what type of information the book provided. I still plan to try out some of the recipes provided in the back of the book.
5,It works!,"The author writes with authority, but not with pomposity. Moreover, the book is readable and easily digestible (pardon the pun). I am following his sensible suggestions for weight loss and healthy eating. I am thrilled with how I feel and the difference I am starting to see in my weight."
5,Makes great sense!,"I read the print version, not Kindle, but the guy makes total sense. The word 'seduction' is so perfect. It's like there is a siren call of high calorie food that often calls to us and the doctor has some sensible advice. I really like the idea of eating lots of beans, too, because I love them, they're high in fiber and a great weight loss tool."
5,"A voice thick with innuendo, syphilis and greed","There is no Nick but Nick.Perhaps one of Nick's greatest talents is for telling stories, for painting images with his lyrics with, truth to tell, far greater success than he has managed thus far in his written fiction (see ""And the Ass Saw the Angel"" under books!). Tender Prey is as much a collection of short stories as it is of songs: ""Watching Alice"" and ""Mercy"" are filled with vivid and compelling images, though with enough ambiguity to fuel debates as to who--or what--exactly the characters described may be. ""The Mercy Seat"" is simply pure Nick: relentlessly paced, pounding perfection. And you get two versions on this one album!"
5,I think my head is burning.....,"Recorded as Cave succumbed ever more to the hell of heroin addiction, this is the most darkly intense Bad Seed album ever, and possibly the best."
1,Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Tender Prey,"This was one of the worst albums I have ever listened to. I bought it for the second track, 'Up Jumped the Devil'. I couldn't even get through it past track 3. The intro was awful. Just horrible, droning nonsense for three or so miserable unending minutes. I made it to the third song and it was as bad as the first. I couldn't take any more. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who values their ears or brain."
5,Tender Prey Remaster,"Mick Harvey has done an outstanding job with this whole set of remasters. The fidelity on these recordings is amazing, and you can really hear all the instrument voicings in a way they you couldn't on the originals. A+"
2,Uau....!,"Reading all the reviews you'll think this is the best album ever. It's not true. This is just cheap and boring alternative rock, played by guys dressed like Duran Duran."
1,Nunca llega a puerto.,"Pérez-Reverte olvidó a sus lectores, esa es la única explicación.Olvidó que los que lo leíamos, lo hacíamos para entretenernos, no para marearnos en la borda de un barco que a poco andar ya se sabe que se va a hundir.Me he comprado un Titanic de papel."
1,A Major Disappoinment.,"I read the original language edition, and must confess that it took some effort to finish it. After reading some reviews and a short excerpt, I decided to get the book. Too much nautical lingo; endlessly repeated literary images; a sudden, almost forced revelation of the identity of the narrator who could not have known the details of his own story; a not too credible plot (green lobsters?) are some of the book faults. If you are thinking about reading this book, drop it in favor of, for example, Martin Cruz Smith's ""Polar Star"" or ""Havana Bay""."
4,A Thorough and Sophisticated Presentation of Pathogenicity,"As an undergraduate student studying microbiology, I found the book to be extremely technical. I would have appreciated a more clinical approach to pathogenicity. Bacterial Pathogenesis can, however, serve as an excellent reference text concerning the details of pathogenicity on a molecular level. The book covers virulence factors and antibiotic in detail. 21 bacterial diseases are covered extensively, each having its own chapter."
4,GREAT EFFORT FROM ETTA,"""YOU'RE TAKING UP ANOTHER MAN'S PLACE' IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THE CD ALL BY ITSELF. THIS IS A GREAT STUDIO CD FROM ETTA JAMES, FROM 1992. CONTRIBUTING ARTISTS ARE HANK CRAWFORD (SAX) AND STEVE CROPPER (GUITAR), TWO MUSICIANS WHO CAN PLAY THE BLUES WITH ANYBODY."
4,works great,they were delived on time . These are the best razars they give me the close shave I need all the time just love.
4,Better than those plastic things!,I'll keep using these for as long as I can get them. What can I say. I like these blades.
5,"Good blades, fast delivery","Blades are good and they got to my place in good time. Very reasonably priced. I recommend buying these blades as long as you have the proper razor, Schick Injector. I had one of the best shaves with this razor."
2,Not as sharp as I thought!!,"I was really surprise to find out that these were not as sharp as the personna brand. I thought for sure these would provide a closer shave. I don't know if maybe I got a couple of bad razor blades in the container but, so far I have used two of them and I am not impressed!!! These don't compare to the older schick blades at all!!"
4,Works well.,"I have been using Supersmile toothpaste for about 3-4 weeks now. It worked pretty good on it's own, but recently, I've started to also rinse with hydrogen peroxide 1:1 with water. The effects seem more dramatic now. I would say I'm pleased with the product and that you should give it a try."
5,Despite the new body this is still a cute doll,"Although this doll has the new shorter Barbie body, she really is not a bad looking little doll unless you stand her right next to last years' more glamerous Valentine Barbie doll. The heartshaped glassses are very cute , the silver heart necklace also is a nice touch. the bear is adorable. I dislike the red cowboy boots, as they are split up the back . Her facepaint is nice and her eyes are a lovely shade of blue. the mini-skirt with attached cut out hearts belt is also cute but the top is frumpy. This doll can not wear many of the older Babrie fashions because she is shorter and has a smaller bust but when redressed in an older Babrie evening gown that has a velcro back so I could make the fit a bit better, she did in fact make a glamous doll.So this doll is cute as she is but also has the potentional to be much better looking when you redress her."
1,DESCRIPTION DOES NOT MATCH PRODUCT IMAGE!,"THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DESCRIPTION FOR THE VALENTINE DAY BARBIE, YET THE TEXT DESCRIBES A BIRTHDAY BARBIE."
4,Best of them all,"I really enjoy this CD. It's the best Dragon Quest CD I have out of all my other Dragon Quest orchestra CD collection. Track 5 and 13 were my absolute favorites. My dad seems to like it as well. There are no bad parts about this (unless you don't like orchestra music). If you played Dragon Warrior 3 and love its soundtracks, then I recommend you buy this CD!"
3,"Looks beautiful, runs easily","This mascara looks beautiful when applied. Visually, it's the best mascara I've ever used. The problem is that water (rain, a shower) strips it right off your eyelashes and leaves your face covered in mascara flakes. The mascara actually transfers completely from your lashes to your face if it comes into contact with water.For those who love the full, natural look this mascara gives, I recommend using the wand from this Clinique mascara with Physician's Formula mascara found here:http://www.amazon.com/Physicians-Formula-Waterproof-Mascara-Midnight/dp/B001B0TG1W/ref=sr_1_6?s=beauty&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1358122479&sr;=1-6&keywords;=physician%27s+formulaThe two together create smudge-free, waterproof lashes that have the soft and full look of the Clinique mascara."
4,Very enjoyable read,"I enjoyed this book. I am reading autobiograpies of presidents, in order, and found this one of the better ones. The length of the book was appropriate to give a thourough background of what made McKinley the man he was and sufficient coverage of the White House years. I came away with a better understanding of him and an opinion that he should be higer on the list of great presidents."
5,Straight Ahead Jazz!,"I've had the chance to see Jimmy Smith in person at his supper club in the 1970s. A long way from Small's Paradise, where this was recorded live, but I can imagine it. No real disappointments on this album - listening to Groovin' at Small's as I write this. A Night In Tunisia is everything the other reviews say. Note that the recording is probably much improved, but this is a live recording, there are background noises and imperfections, so perhaps it should be 4-1/2 stars. But the music gets five in my book."
5,Beautiful paper,"This paper is just too beautiful to use for my nephew's wedding crane. I've seen what happens to wedding cranes--get stuffed into some dusty old box and stored forever, all crushed and crumpled; or they get left hanging where they are until the cats tear them down, or people take a string home as mementos (and put them in old dusty boxes...). I'm going to make myself some cranes (does the good fortune happen if you ""crane"" yourself?) for my own home with this wonderful paper because at least I appreciate it."
2,Worthless,"The notation for this book is awful. Completely different from three other math books that I have used before. It doesn't adequately explain its own examples, even for the 1 chapter review on ODEs confused me as to what they were trying to accomplish. I gave up on it shortly after that. Even browsing wikipedia is more useful than this book.Cons: Hard to understand; doesn't seem to use standard notation from what I've read.Pros: Cheap. Seems to have a lot of material?"
3,"Probably Good For Mosquitoes, Not Really For Cats","This item is sold as netting to keeps bugs out of your crib- and I suppose it probably does that well.However, I bought this thinking it would keep my cats out of the crib/pack 'n play- and quickly realized it was too much work to remove it every time the babies needed attention.It's easier just to keep the cats locked in another room or train them to avoid the crib by spraying them with water every time they try to jump in it."
5,A FAMILIAR SCENT SINCE CHILDHOOD,"A FINE MILLED SOAP THAT IS NOT HARSH ON THE SKIN, A BEAUTIFUL SCENT THAT EVERYONE COMPLIMENTS. VERY CLEAN & FRESH!"
5,Smells oh so good!,I too love the fragrance of this soap. I enjoy using it as a soap and also love it tucked in with my towels. I am glad I found a place to buy it!
3,The one casanova who fit the suit,"I guess you could call this Barry Williams's ""comeback"" album, although he was never a big record star in the first place. It features two original songs, plus cover versions of many well known songs. The originals are ""Johnny's Back"", which is an amusing tounge-in-cheek song about Barry's alter ego, and ""Here Again"", which is a mediocre ballad. The rest of the songs you are probably already familiar with. I have to admit, Barry sings very well. His voice is much improved from his ""Greg Brady"" days, and he handles most of the songs pretty well. The question is, do you really need to hear Barry Willams covering Queen, Huey Lewis and the Bee Gees? If you do, this is the album for you."
5,"Put plainly, a masterpiece","I never would have believed Williams could outdo rock n roll classics like ""Keep On"" and ""We Could Make The World a Whole Lot Brighter"" but the Casanova of Clinton Avenue has done it! Tunes like ""Johnny's Back"" are what rock n roll is about. A must have for any discerning music fan.This guy really fits the suit!!!"
3,Nostalgia Worthy,"I got this CD because I'm a Brady Bunch fan, and I loved the episode with Johnny Bravo! Barry Williams can sing, but his vocals were stronger on the Best of the Brady Bunch CD, It's a Sunshine Day. He is ok here, but not as strong as in the past. Still, I'd recommend this CD for all Brady Bunch fans, and lovers of nostalgia."
5,A long overdue return from the multi-talented Williams!,"Barry Williams was one of the premier stars of the 70s. This album is a long overdue display of his intense vocal stylings. The second track, Sunshine Medley, while lacking Maureen McCormick's sweet counterpart, brings you back to the days when Greg Brady was who you wanted to be when you grew up.I would never have thought that anyone could pull off the Rythym of the Night better than El DeBarge did it, but Williams manages it. Finally, Williams' rendition of We Are the Champions is an incredible display of not only his vocal range, but also his emotional diversity, envoking a memory of Freddie Mercury that literally put tears in my eyes.This should be nominated for album of the year!"
3,you guys are a hoot!,"I had a good laugh at some of the reviews on this page! Some very creative expressions :-) I guess this is just one of those things that you either really really like or you really really hate...me? I just don't know, I've only heard the samples...sounds fun (or funny) to me!"
3,Not what I expected,"This album is not very good.Barry CAN sing,but these tunes that he chose just don't cut it.I bought this album hoping the great ""Johnny Bravo"" would pick good tunes to croon on.Instead he picked already pretty weak tracks.The only exception is ""Happy Together"",he did an excellent job on that.""Johnny's Back"" is VERY childish sounding though his voice is the best on it."
2,Disillusioned listener,"I saw Barry Williams in a production of West Side Story. His rendition of Maria sent chills up my spine. I couldn't believe that awesome voice was coming from Barry Williams. So....what happened to THAT voice? Maybe show tunes are more his bag. I promise, he really CAN sing, given the right arrangement."
2,barry's back and ready to rock,The reason i bought this cd is probobly the reason most of you bought it. It is Greg Brady he doesent have a bad voice it's just not great. Take it for what it's worth listen and enjoy i do especially the song here again and johnny's back
1,This guy has no talent what-so-ever.,"I feel sick that they categorized this never-was with Dave Matthews Band. People should be ashamed to own this album, much less suggesting that it should be album of the year."
1,This is a joke right?,"When I first saw this I thought, wow, Greg Brady is doing a Weird Al thing, kind of a spoof/parody/joke...Then I listened to it ... and low and behold! I do believe he's serious! Hmmm.. will this go gold? Will he do a reunion tour with the rest of the Brady's? A duet with Marsha? A rap song with Alice? Oh the possibilities! The vocal stylings of Greg Brady, just what we need to usher in the new millenium."
1,Not worth buying,"This ""book"" of about 20 pages is very overpriced, in spite of the generous Amazon discount. It is mostly blank space, sheets upon which the user must write everything. One could accomplish the same thing using a notebook, regular calendar, or grid created on a computer. There is a page of instructions, pretty much common sense for anyone who has done budgeting. I hope to return the one I ordered."
2,Get a calendar is right!,"All this book is is a monthly planner/calendar so you can visualize what is going out and coming in. You're better off getting a calendar at the store and using that, or do like I do, and keep track of it on a dry erase board!. All in all, kinda disappointing. It sounds like it's a book helping you create a budget, but it's just telling you where your money goes (which I admit is a good 1st step towards budgeting) but not helping you set limits."
1,Go Buy A Calendar,"Ok, So I thought this was going to have some sort of system to it...NAH. It is a calendar. You write on the Calendar when your bills are due. If I were you I would just go buy a calendar with lines on it. That is the basics of what this ""system"" is."
3,Passing it on,"If you are expecting to see/hear kenny burrell burning through a set of standards on this,don't buy it.If you want to see him at ucla(?) passing on the history of our music to the younger generation and hearing his original music being played by the student ensemble ,then this is the dvd for you."
1,Dosen't fit my HP 8180,"Although this is advertised as fitting the HP 8100 series, it does not fit my HP8180. Do not order this if you want it for an 8180"
3,two side print,This item don't fit my printer.I buy in a hurry and don't read the compatibility note. I'm going to try to sell it locally.Sorry and thanks.
4,Great time saver...but a little squeaky!,"I didn't realize how much time (or paper) a duplexer could save you! While you can manually print on both sides with any printer, having this unit makes the process painless and automated. If only my unit didn't squeak when running!"
1,Glad it worked for everyone else here,"I have an HP AIO 7280 which came with the duplexer. That works great. I also have a Photosmart 8450 which did not come with the duplexer. In researching the potential to get one, I find this product which claims to be compatible. I quickly purchased it. Very easy to install. THe HP software for this printer immediately picked up the fact that duplex printing is enabled. So I tried printing a two-page document. Duplexer worked fine - mechanically. The only issue is that the second page printed upside down. In reviewing this on the Internet, I find this is apparently a common problem. In calling HP support, I was fortunate enough to speak to someone who was more interested in getting my email address than helping me with the issue, which is still occurring.Bottom line, check the Internet to see if your printer has issues with this accessory (or 'Accessoory' as the HP User Guide calls it)."
1,Slothful,"I agree with Dr. John's review of this book, which could have been interesting, save for the bad editing. When one reads a book on any subject, one expects to read good English. Dr. JOhn is correct about the misuse of prepositions and other ""Mistakes"" in the book. The subject matter could have been interesting but for the distractions of the bad English."
4,A pleasant read,"The Last Days of Haute Cuisine is a pleasant read which gives an overview of the US restaurant scene over the past half decade. The book does an excellent job of putting the most well known food writers in context, in relation both to their time and to each other. Lastly, and most importantly, it is simply a good story (one that might remind you of the James Burke ""Connections"" television series).Recommended."
2,William Faulkner writes a Food Book,"I couldn't follow this book until the last 4 chapters. Kuh does not write with any sense of order, pattern, or routine. The beginning chapters are a mess.It's just so hard to follow...reminds me of the first section in The Sound and the Fury.I suppose if you are very familiar with US FOOD HISTORY you can figure it out. I am not. I am well versed in Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. I bought this book to enlighten myself and learn about the history of American Cuisine.Having said that, the last 1/3rd of the book is pretty good. My favorite parts are the history of Chez Panisse (co-ed naked cooks) and the opening of Le Cirque in Vegas.I am glad I read it, but it took too much work to enjoy.Like a tough steak."
1,HORRIBLE PINS,"I never thought I would be leaving a review for something as simple as pins. But, these are so poorly made that I felt I needed to review them. First of all, not all of the ends were sharpened, so they wouldn't penetrate the fabric and they would start to bend. I wasn't using upholstery fabric, for goodness sake. I was just trying to pin quilting cotton. Also, some of the flower heads just broke right off the first time I used these. They are a waste of money and could actually be a danger because they are so unpredictable."
2,not worth the money,"Pins came pre-bent six to be exact, and two had the ends blunt instead of point making them non usable. Just not worth the price I would send them back but not worth that either."
4,"A gripping, fascinating, mesmerizing true horror story","The substance of the book was absolutely riveting, disturbing, and incredible. You won't be able to put it down,for the author draws you into the tribulations of trying to stop a monster. But the book was so poorly edited - a myriad of typographical errors, that I was compelled to write to the publisher...In sum, great book..."
5,a true crime masterpiece,"I found this to be a real page turner.What a disturbing ""family"". Lowell Cauffiel really does his homework.I have also read his book ""Masquerade"", and its even better.I plan on reading more of his work.by the way,the main person in the story,eddie lee sexton, is on death row in florida,for these crimes.as of 2007."
4,Review on House of Secrets,"To say I liked this book is confusing. No one should like this book. It's a horrific story. Nothing like this should happen to children. I grew up as a neighbor of this family, and I never knew what was going on inside the walls of that house. I just knew they were odd. Sweet kids, but odd. The book itself is well written, keeps you interested. By the time I was done reading it, I was shocked to see the condition it was in. It was tattered and torn up from being anxious while I was reading. It did give me nightmares, which usually doesn't happen to me from books or movies. If you're into true crime, it's beyond anything you've ever imagined. Really."
3,Horrifying,"True crime is always horrifying to me, but this is extreme. It took me several days to read the 429 pages of this book. I just finished it and plan to read it again, starting tomorrow. There are so many players, and most of them have nick-names, that it boggled my mind. So many things are going on at the same time it's hard to keep up. Some of the chapters start with 'The day before...'. A lot of time jumping goes on and it's hard to keep track. Mr. Cauffiel's editor missed several typo's, too.A very captivating read, though, even if it is confusing.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"
3,Good But...,"This true crime/horror tale was interesting but...the constant switching from legal names, then to nicknames was both confusing and annoying. I believe this was something a seasoned editor would have sorted out. All and all the book was a good read but...pick a name and stick to it throughout the entire book!"
3,Dysfunctional Family Circus.,"The tale of the Sexton's is not for the faint of heart.This is a fairly well written book, although I will admit that the way the information was organized did not help the story flow at times.But the fact that these people were allowed to escape detection for so long, (You cannot begin to fathom the twisted parentage the Sexton children were raised under. It will chill you to the core people like this exist) is what I felt most abhorrent.While the book chronicles some of the freak show that was the Sexton Family life, I think it better serves to show just how inept our family service system has become."
5,CREEPY,This book was one of the best I've ever read. It was so creepy and twisted it was hard to believe it was true! To think people like that walk on this earth among us is unreal! Pity those poor kids brought up in that wacky household. Ed Sexton shame on you -populating the earth with children through your own daughters!Shocking-simply because it all happened to be true!
4,riviting from the first page to the end.,this is the type of book that you just cant put down once you start to read it you just keep going. true some of it was poorly written. but just to see what can happen with anyones neighbor is horrifying. i reside less then two miles from the sexton home. one of my closest friends even dated machelle sexton. just to find this kind of things happen so close to home is shocking. but it proves it can happen to anybody. i recommend this book to everyone.
3,Family disfunction ... makes Manson seem tame.,"I am a big fan of true-crime writing... but this book, well, it was just disturbing. More of a story of incest and family disfunction than a true-crime type of book. Personally, I was hoping that the entire family would be wiped out in a mobile home fire. Sadly, this never happened.If you are into reading about incest, rape, child abuse and baby killing this is the book for you. This family was only missing a banjo and opossum stew. I, however, will go back to reading relatively tame serial killer books. At least serial killers have some redeeming qualities..."
2,Really Slow and Unorganized book.....,"I am addicted to true crime books and if your like me, it should start out with a gripping fact that reels you into the story. However this story gets off to such a SLOW start that for about 100 pages it talks about the kids, not talking to the authorities as well as other people that do not tie into the book right away. Also it was mentioned in another review that it starts off with 15 different names, then it switches to nicknames, then back to their given names. This is a very unorganized way to write a story of any kind and can be confusings especially when their is 15 children in the story. This book was a big disappointment and a waste of time..."
3,Poorly Written/Increadible Story; Should have been rewritten,This was one of the most interesting stories I've ever read. I was truely dissapointed by the way it was edited. I still don't think I know who is who because they referred to the kids by different names every time you turned around making it extremely hard to follow. I think this could have been a fabulous story had it been professionally written and edited. The only reason I give it three stars and not two is becuase the content was fascinating.
2,Poor execution detracted from interesting subject.,"The premise of Cauffiel's book was quite interesting, which is what attracted me to it. However, in spite of the interesting subject matter, the book was a disappointment to me because of the poor editing and dry, journalistic writing. I was distracted by countless typo's and poorly executed prose. This was very frustrating. ""America's Most Dysfunctional Family"" should have made for riveting reading, but it was simply not well enough written to be riveting. Overall, I could not recommend this book as written."
4,Mesmerizing!,"If you are endlessly fascinated by this genre of book, it's a ""must read"". A truly gripping account of probably one of the most dysfunctional families of all times. You won't be able to put it down, and when you're done reading it, you'll be looking for the publisher's address -- as I did -- to write and ask about how the survivors of the family are doing. For any of them to have turned out even remotely ""normal"", whatever your definition of that term might include, is extraordinary. READ IT!"
4,Horrifically engrossing,"I read a lot of True Crime, but this one was top of the list. Unbelieveable but true...made my blood boil. The worst case of incest/abuse I've ever read."
3,Warning-May cause sleep loss!,This one was hard to put down. This is a true story and actual police reports and interviews are used. It is hard to believe this kind of evil exists. I am a psych major and find this sort of thing disturbing but yet I have a desire to know why people become these monsters. Maybe no one will ever know.
5,Must Read !True Crime At its Finest!,"This is a very Well written True Crime Book,The story of a family so twisted that its hard to imagine that its not fiction.The Sextons are more than your typical Dysfunctional family,They give the word a whole new meaning!! I read a lot of True Crime and this book really stands out for me.Its a story I will not soon forget! A Must Read! I am in a True Crime book club on Yahoo,Many of us read this and all of us gave it 5 stars!"
3,Cute movie,"I enjoyed this movie pretty much. I liked the premise of it, and the main characters were fairly interesting. It's basically a teeny bopper movie but nice for one of those days when you just want to watch a movie and not have to deal with social commentary or violence."
3,Good for what it is.,This is a fun clean movie! It is obviously targeted towards a yound audiance and is very obvious it is cliches. That being said it is still cute and fun.
5,My Temptation,Great early release from Within Temptation. Sharon den Adel is fantastic. Excellent voice with tremendous range.
2,these guys cannot sing?,"I usually love madness music. I had never heard them live before, though.Either they had a bad day when recording this concert or they should thank their producers a thousand times over for magically rescuing their studio recordings. The instrumentals are great in this live recording; vocals (lead as well as background) are abysmal. To me the vocals sound very poor and often off key, this is really not enjoyable."
4,'Sounds From Psychedelphia' (Lounge Records) Various Artists - 4 1/2 stars,"This has got to be one of the better various artists CD compilaions I've ever heard. One track each from ten(10) vitually unknown/little known psychedelic bands. Tunes from Three Four Ten,Transient Waves,Photon Band,Intro To India and the unbeatable Asteroid #4 make this title a true keeper. Bent Lag Fatima's ""Ad"" sort of maybe reminded me of Fifty Foot Hose and the only cut here I didn't like was Azusa Plane's ""Drinking Scotch"" which to me,sounded like a jogger running through a parking lot while playing an out-of-tune sitar. A bit too strange for me. Otherwise,'Sounds...' is a great pick. Essential!"
4,sounds from psychedelphia,"Most compilation albums out there suck because some songs on it are great while others are turkeys. All the songs on here are great. A few are just experimental studio tinkering and so I skip them when I listen to the album (but they're still kinda cool for that sort of thing), but there are some real gems of songs on here. I highly reccomend this if you're looking for some modern 60's inspired psychedelic music. There's a song on here that sounds like Apples in Stereo and some other songs heavy on droning organ, another couple of really poppy songs, et cetera."
5,Carriers,"Carriers s about a virus thet is hatching out in the Indonesian Rain Forest. The ""bug"" is one hundred times more contagious thab Ebola. A team of American biological warefare experts Jansen, Detroit, Kinnel are going to discover were it came from. All the clues they get are corpses and they riddles without answers. For a while they think its Ebola but it feeds on its victums quickly so its hard to track down. Will theAmerican Biological warefare experts get infected too? Or will they stop the deadly vius from spreading to a nearby city...This book is good for me because I like books with a good mystery or unexpected twist at the end."
2,Workable for a medical thriller,"If the author hadn't made Holly into such a mushy hysterical woman who does nothing but get in the way and act out of her own selfishness, I may have given this another star. Everything else about this book had the potential to be thriller-tastic, from government engineered viruses to playing god to conspiracy. Ratchet those aspects up a few notches and keep Holly tucked safely away in New York, this could have been a goodie.I did find it fun to read about all of these American characters and settings through the eyes of a British writer, or I assume Lynch is British because so many of the terms he uses are from across the pond."
3,"Not bad, not great","Carriers is a fair-to-good biosci thriller. It is also too long. The result frustrates with its seemingly endless end-of-the-chapter cliffhangers that are never satisfactorily resolved. Another more humorous result begins on page 110 of the paperback in which Holly returns from a day exploring near her ex-husband's campsite (which she indicates is near Muaratebo on the map she is carrying). Later (about a hundred pages or so), she asks: ""Muaratebo, where's that?"" Evidence, in my mind, that even the author couldn't quite keep up with the endless list of characters and cliffhangers."
5,"This book was one word....... ""AWESOME!""","I read this book for school in place of The Hot Zone because I had already read it. I thought that Richard Preston had done a fine job on The Hot Zone, but once I finished Carriers, I changed my mind completely. The amount of detail that Patrick Lynch added made this book so life-like that it got scary. This book was amazingly well written, and is better, I think, than even Hot Zone itself. Read this if you want a non-stop read that'll have you gasping for air at the end!"
1,Totally boring book,The general idea isnt bad but the pace becomes too slow. Most of the book is about the wandering of people in the Indonesian forest. Nothing interesting really happens until the last 50 pages. The characters are also very cliche.
3,"A time passer, but if you like accuracy, don't bother.","I love medical thrillers and am in the medical field myself. I did not find as much fault with scientific accuracy (within the scope of a fictitious work), but when I hit page 94 of my paperback edition, and found that to get from Aspen Hill, MD to Frederick it is necessary to drive over the Appalachians, I was horrified. To magnify my horror, Carmen drove over the ""Monocary ""River to get there, when the very historic river from Civil War era is ""Monocacy"". I know these are pitiful details, but it is very easy to check this stuff out (there also is no ""turnpike"" anywhere in the area). Having been in USAMRIID hundreds of times, I also find the description of it rather inaccurate, but I can forgive this, since the author may never have had access.Basically, for a good, fast read, I see nothing terribly wrong with it, but if you live in Maryland and like proper details, you may want to pass."
5,Good Product,"This was purchased as a gift for home use, so this review is not based on professional use of the product.It came quickly and well packed. I had not complaints with the company.Assembly was easy, just add batteries and attach the ball to the stand. It connects using a cotter pin that just slides on. The stand can be placed on a table or hung from the ceiling (it has a wire half-moon that would connect over a hook attached to the ceiling). The light comes with 4 color covers.Everything worked out of the box without issues. About the only complaint I have is when changing the color discs, you unscreww the outer plate of the light. I found it takes a few tries to get it screwed back on. You have to line it up just right. Otherwise, excellent product."
1,Piece of Junk,"I got this for a party and tested it out and it worked fine. Then the day of the party I noticed it ran for about 5 minutes then stopped spinning. If I shook it and toggled the switch a few times it would start going again. Yeah, that's really a fun thing to do during a party. I tried everything to fix it. I tried 3 different new batteries. I opened it up and reconnected all the wires. I sprayed it with WD40. I tried it both upside down and on the stand. I never could get it to go for more than 5 minutes. Don't waste your time on this piece of junk."
1,VERY poorly made,"I bought one of these for a Halloween party. The lighting effect looks great, when the product is working. The gears inside would bind up in several spots. This caused the ball to constantly lock up. This is a big disappointment. We were all excited to have a mirror ball for the party. It is too late to get it replaced before the event... The locking ring for the light was also screwed on crooked from the factory. This bent the ring slightly. I was able to fix that, but its another indication that there is absolutely no concern about quality. Buy at your own risk."
5,"Works great, better than previous one","I had another one with the same type of light and mirror ball, but the motor was different. This one allows it to be hung or to stand it up which has worked better. Simple, light and works ""cool."""
2,Poor quality,"The disco ball was a huge disappointment. The picture that is used is not at all like to item I received. The base is not a plug it is battery operated and it is a tabletop stand with the option of a hanging ball. The ball is not secure on the base, it is very wobbly, even my 6 year old was afraid it was going to break. We bought this for our playroom to secure to the ceiling but there was no easy way to turn it on without a ladder each time, not to mention I was afraid it would fall on our heads. I was not at all happy and did return the item. I am a frequent Amazon shopper and this is the first time I have ever had to return something."
5,Party Fever,Product was great for the price. Had gotten a second one shipped cuz of the first had motor malfunction.But got the second one and turned it on for an after party. Made the room much more exiting
2,Does not work if you use Battery Power,"I got 4 of these for a Holiday Party. I needed battery power as there are no outlet near will I would have hung these.Spot light worked great, but I thought it was going to use battery's. It does not. You have to plug it in.Disco Ball - well made, but the base does not work well if you are using battery power. They really hard time spinning upside or right side up.I have returned them, as they will not work for my holiday party."
4,very nice mirror ball and good price,"The ball is very nice, but the battery powered spinner goes too quickly and it makes one feel a bit sea sick. I used it alone and it provided a nice party light."
3,The battery powered motor does not work.,"We bought this for my daughter's Rockstar birthday party. Unfortunately we had to plug it in since the batter powered motor does not work. The ball was still a big hit and we intend to use it for future parties. However, it would be nice if Amazon could ship us a new motor for this item."
3,Good product for the price..,I purchased this for my daughter & she loved it. The only issue is hanging the light but you can get creative and make it happen.
2,Junk,"I never feel compelled to write a review, but I read so many mixed ones on this item that I thought I should add my 2 cents. It't junk. Save your $."
3,STOPPPED ROTATING ON 1ST USE...,Looked great but the disco ball stopped rotating during the first use. All of the 13 yr olds at the party didn't seem to mind but I was dissappointed.
1,Don't buy this...,"Picture shows a CABLE POWERED motor, it comes with a battery powered that will BRAKE DOWN AFTER 5 MINUTES!!!The MIrror ball doesn't hold the little mirrors!!! They fall off one by one!!!Save money, Get something else."
4,Inspiring,"This book was a remarkable story of a woman's strength. As I recall the shooting of over 20 years ago, I remember how eventually we all went on with our lives and didn't think about the ways in which one young man with a gun changed so many lives forever that day at the Hilton Hotel in DC. Sarah Brady made it her personal mission to put the NRA out of business to keep us all safe from the senseless gun violence that changed her life forever. I would recommend this book to anyone who is inspired by the dedication and will of others and would like to change the world for the better."
1,something you should know,Our main agenda is to have all guns banned. We must use what ever means possible. It dosen`t matter if you have to distort the facts or even lie. Our task of creating a socialist America can only succeed when those who would resist us have been totally disarmed. ( Quote Sara Brady to Senator Metzenbaun in January 1994.) Now thats some scary stuff. Look at the arrogance in that quote. It is proof of what I have always known about Sara Brady and Politcians like her. They do not really care about public safty . It`s about power. More power for them and more proof of why the 2nd amendment is so impotant and why it was given too us.
1,Stay away!,Brady ignores the statistics and the US Constitution (except her own first amendment rights)in her lockstep quest to rid the world of guns. She apparently believes that the opposing side is not allowed their first amendment rights (let alone their second amendment rights) while she should be able to fully exercise hers.Avoid this book at all costs.
1,YOBO?,This is not an XBOX s-type controller. Do not let the picture fool you because they will send you a YOBO gameware controller. I have never even heard of YOBO and it is ridiculous to call it an s-type. This place ripped me off and I just want to prevent others from being fooled.
2,So-So,This controller is NOT made by microsoft!! The right thumbstick is messed up and the logo was already coming off when i got it the face buttons are fine and if you dont have to click the thumbstick then its an ok controller
1,Two of the three I purchased are broken!,"I didn't fully inspect them when I received them, I just wrapped them and today I have to very disappointed children!"
3,ok for a controller,this contoller is ok but the only problem is the cord is short not long like the microsoft ones but it is a good controller replacement for and obsolet game system i bought 2 and will probably by one more because i modded my console so i got tons to play and watch stuff
4,Mythology in a nutshell,"With each chapter written by an expert, plus beautiful illustrations, this is a great anthology for those seeking a bird's eye view of the World's myths and legends. It is also fun to read and is not dense to the point that it cannot be read from cover to cover. I took off a star because there was nothing on Finnish mythology. Also, the mythology of Persia was just one page long, which I felt was too little."
3,Broad overview of world mythology,It is a heavy book giving an overview of world mythology. There are little original texts and the myths are not told in great detail.
4,Beautiful Ilustrations,"This book was purchased by me for my class in Fantasy, Myth and Enchantment. The general consensus is that the illustrations are beautiful, the history of where the myths come from are great and the myths themselves although good can be a bit dry."
4,Great experience,"I bought this book for a class that I had over the summer. I now keep it on my coffee table and when people stop by, they automatically pick it up. Very good for some light reading on the side and very knowledgeable."
1,Retold version dilutes the original meaning of the book,"I received Patricia Pingry's ""retelling"" of ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" as a gift for my baby. Upon reading it I quickly realized that this version modifies the original and dilutes much of its meaning. It eliminates some of the sad and difficult portions of the original story, perhaps to make it more comfortable for parents and children alike. But the result is to soften the book's overall impact. I recommend buying the orignal version by Margery Williams, not this bland ""retold"" version."
5,A Heartwarming Story,"I bought this book as I had seen the author on the television. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it, or maybe put it to one side to read another time. It's about a man's struggle to adopt a child, which would be a book in itself, but the fact that the man is gay makes it even more compelling. David Mckinstry gives a frank and honest look into his personal life, and you feel as though you are fighting with him. I ran the gammet of emotions while reading this - I laughed, cried, and got angry with the world. I realised that the most important thing in a child's life is love, and that the sexuality of the parent is irrelevant. The things that happen in a heterosexual relationship's bedroom do not affect the child, so I was at a loss to understand why authorities believe that what happens in a gay man's bedroom is important.This book is a truly good read. You be amazed at how much one person can achieve if he really dares to chase his dreams."
3,Double Check the compatabilitiy of this push bar -,Like the kettrike this bar is made well. It does NOT fit all kettrikes - I have the Jumbo Model and it will not work.
2,Doesn't fit all Kettler Trikes !,"This bar might be great, but be careful before buying. I bought 2 Kettler Go Green fold n'go tricycles (1 for me, 1 for the ex) fro Toys R Us, and was amazed when I opened the carton there was no pushbar. I was told it used to come with one, but no longer does (not sure if the price was reduced for no p/b though). So I searched all over the internet including Kettler's own website, to find this pushbar and read reviews saying it worked for the fold n/go's. Guess what - works for the fold n'go's, but according to Kettler customer service, not the Go Green fold n'go's. Apparently customers complained the bar that came with was not ""green"" like the bike, so the mfg stopped supplying it with the trike! The Go Green has a smaller opening for the bar, so this bar is too big. Only place to get a bar is Kettler direct for [...]. Have tor eturn this one. Hope I don't pay shipping!"
3,PUSH BAR DOES NOT FIT ALL KETTLER TRIKES,"F.Y.I. After waiting 2 months for this PUSH BAR to arrive, I discovered that it doesn't work on the EX KIDDIO SUPERTRIKE 1 model #8142-899C M.D.0605V1. 'Called Kettler to find that there isn't an adapter for the EX KIDDIO available...somewhat disappointing since the PUSH BAR would probably be nice to have-(less back strain during the ""learning phase"")! 'Have to return the ""already assembled"" trike for a much more expensive one-or return the long-awaited PUSH BAR!"
1,didn't receive all parts,I really cannot review as when I ordered it - it did not come with all the necessary hardware to put it together - I contacted the seller who told me that Kettler would need to send me the parts and that they have been contacted. Still waiting to put this Christmas gift together....
4,Good bar for toddler bikes,"I suppose if a bike had a bar attachment, this is what it would need to be like. However, don't expect life with a toddler on a bike to be any easier. You can't steer with this. I constantly find myself telling my son to turn his bike so we can get out of the middle of the street, because it is difficult to do with the bar."
5,again - not a toy,Handle bar is very convenient. I have used it frequently and it is very durable. It arrived on time and packaged well. Easy to install.
3,"Works ok, steering is difficult","This is a nice option for the Kettler tricycle, allowing adults to push toddlers who are not old enough to pedal on their own. Steering is difficult for the adult pushing the toddler."
1,HORRIBLY difficult!,I recently bought this product because Punch! was supposed to be the leader in all landscape and design software. They may be but their software is HORRIBLE to use! I am returning it to the place I purchased it. I spent over 12 hours trying to figure out how to simply upload a photo of my house and put pictures of plants and such on it. I still haven't figured it out after reading the monstrous manual 2x and sitting through all of the help video tours. I contacted Punch! and they want me to PAY to receive any sort of training for this software. This is ridiculous. Maybe a pro can figure this out but DO NOT buy this software if you simply want to envision your house with new landscaping.
2,Didn't last half a season,"my 2 boys are crazy for their boots, however, after wearing them 3-4 times a week for 2 months they started ripping apart all over: up the back, across the front...they are literally in shreds. i will make a better investment next year!"
2,Coming apart at the seams,"I bought these shoes for my four year old son, and they became an instant favorite. He wore them almost everyday. Unfortunately, after about a month of wear, the ""teeth"" are wearing away and the seam down the back of the boot has ripped. After the application of a little super glue, he can wear them again, but next time I buy rainboots-which will be soon considering these are coming apart at the seams-I will look for another brand."
1,Stanislaw,"Graham Fitch, an attorney, was acquainted with a Polish immigrant, Stanislaw Stocowski, in Seattle, Washington. Fitch attempts to tell the story of how, after Stanislaw's death, he (Fitch) travels to Poland to find Stanislaw's family to give them their inheritance. Fitch continually digresses into unnecessary and distracting tales. It is interesting to hear of his experiences in Communist Poland in 1967, however."
5,Stimulating!,"I could envision every character and scene, right down to the food served. The story grips your attention immediately and doesn't let go. I could not put this one down. Excellent!"
4,Adventure of a Lawyer?,"I was surprised to find a book that begins by talking about the family history of an attorney to be interesting, but it was hard to put down. I hope he has more stories to tell, though this one might be hard to top.Great story of a hopefully departed era, but people being the way they are, it may be over in one place and current another. Worth both money and time."
1,Totally Dumb,"I bought this book this weekend for a (hopefully) hilarious read. What I got instead was ridiculously stupid. Knowing many bears (and being one), AND knowing many writers, I found none of this clearly plot-driven twaddle believable. I did not laugh, but I did cry to think of how much money I paid for this book. Give it a pass."
1,Ludicrous and disappointing,"There have been several books about and for the bear community of gay men, including Ron Suresha's ""Bears on Bears"" and Ray Kampf's ""The Bear Handbook"". Now we have ""Bear Like Me"" by Jonathan Cohen, which is about Peter who is fired from his job at ""Phag"" magazine. At a friend's suggestion, Peter decides to go undercover in the bear community to get material to write a book. So he sheds his stereotypical gay image for the stereotypical bear image, and eventually breaks up with his twink boyfriend. He plots revenge on ""Phag"" magazine and its staff, and navigates the bear dating world. He finds love, but will this new guy love Peter for who he is when it's revealed he once was not a bear? What sounds like a madcap adventure quickly becomes a tedious, inane, and self-conscious story that fails to entertain. The bear community deserves better."
4,A Cross-over Hit?,"I found this book so appealing, I lent it to a friend of mine who has had an extensive history with the Bear community in Chicago. He not only enjoyed it, he commented on how accurately it captures the ""family atmosphere"" he enjoyed among the Bears while living in Chicago. Since Mr.Cohen lays out the ""ground rules"" of the Bear lifestyle from an outsider's perspective, I lent it to a Strate friend of mine to see if she'd like it. While the book may have given her more details than she had bargained for (Not that the book is wall-to-wall with sex scenes), she did say she enjoyed the book. Who knows, with enough promotion, ""Bear With Me"" my become a cross-over hit with the general public! Spread the word, Bears!"
4,"Funny, breezy","I really enjoyed this book. It's not the type of book I would normally read, but maybe now that'll change. It was very funny, breezy and actually pretty hot in some places. Nothing earthshaking, just a very entertaining story with some fun characters. Woof!"
1,dont waste your time nor money,"man i wished someone else had written a review on this, i did'nt even finish watching the movie it sucked so bad. One dude who thinks he is some super hero runs around as a protector for the daughter of a rich guy. when she gets in trouble he appears with two other persons. The dialog is cheesy the plot makes no sense and the fight sceens look like they were done by 5 year olds. Please dont waste your money."
5,Shane is a great new talent,Shane is a great new talent that is breaking into country music. I think he has a great future with in country music and shane and Curb Records couldn't have picked a better song to start he career with.
5,Shane McAnally rocks with his new single.,"Shane has tremendous talent and an affectionate personality that one cannot help but love. Knowing him personally, I can say that he has the desire and the talent to make it big in the country industry. His first single Say Anything is a reflection of him. Upbeat and to the point. His voice has a unique style that really gives his songs that extra something. Check out his video on CMT. R Qualls (2514)"
5,This is a GREAT song,Shane seems likely to be the next George or Garth in country music.I have never seen so much talent in such a young person.He has the want to and drive right along with all that talent. You GO Shane!
5,Refreshing good news,"Brilliant style and deep insight in the Gospels' teaching. This book, just as ""Faith Beyond Resentment"", renews and maintains my Catholicity."
5,An engaging book,"Like his companion book, Life of Johnny Reb, this book looks at how soldiers were recruited and kept by the Army. The Union had the advantage of an army already in being but its expansion to meet its wartime needs changed the very nature of the Federal Army. This is a fine book and one that any real Civil War buff should have."
3,"My 5yo loves it, I don't.","The adventures are great, but the total lack of parental supervision is emphasized as ""great"" just a few too many times for my taste. The writing isn't very good, with far too many run-on sentences for easy out-loud reading. My daughter LOVES Pippi, I'm not a fan. It might be a book better suited to when she can read on her own."
2,Hard to set up---stitching questionable,We have used this tent a few times and our biggest problem is getting it set up. Due to the height it is hard to adjust the poles if they snag the pole pockets. The last time we used it my wife was trying to attach the pole to the bottom hook and managed to crack the metal bolster where the poles come together. We had to make a splint out of a couple of metal stakes to keep the pole together. Also during a windy night some of the stiching around the front rainfly has started to seperate. The amount of interior room is nice and the ceiling height is great. Quality doesn't seem to live up to the Wenger name. Our friends have a Kelty and it is a world apart in quality from this Wenger.
4,The plot continues...,"Sequel to Stardoc, and another fast and furious read. Emotional highs and lows, excellent mystery and medical drama. Really easy to get into the characters."
2,"Lots of dressing, not much meat","Both this book and Stardoc (the first in the series) are very gripping when you first start reading. Then you start descovering that the plot is poor except for some very interesting ideas. The poorness of the plot is then compensated buy lots of text, with parallel or sideway developments that lead nowhere. Dr. Cherijo spends her time bumping into clues that she thinks important that she never purues until close to the end of the book where everything is revealed. Of course, to ensure that you will buy the next book, the end has always something that is misterious or puzzling to ensure that you buy the next book."
1,Better a New Idea,"The first book was intriguing, if a tad icky where it didn't need to be. This one, especially the ending, was quite a bit more than icky.Another series that would have been better to be only one book, and the author choosing a new idea for the next plot."
4,"A pleasant surprise. Not just about tomatoes, about life.","This book is to tomatoes what ""Trout Fishing in America"" is to trout.I knew Richard Brautigan from Enrico's restaurant and bar in San Francisco in the 70s. I cherish his autographed inscription ""to Richard from Richard"" on my dog-eared copy of ""The Tokyo-Montana Express"".I look forward to meeting Steve Shepherd.He, too, is a keen observer of life. However, Shepherd sees the joys of life. He writes with a wry humor and a twinkle in his eye. You'll want to have his Italian-American neighbors over for dinner. You'll want to move to San Diego. You'll want to raise tomatoes. As an ex New Yorker and big fan of the New Jersey tomato, I found this book a joy to read. The title is great, too. ""In praise of tomatoes."" This book would make a great gift for anyone who has ever tried to grow anything, any place, at any time."
4,Loved this book,"If you love growing tomatoes, you willsmile while reading this account of a summerof tomato trials and tribulations."
1,Gardening tips from the PC thought police.,"I was fully prepared to enjoy this book. I love travel and gardening memoirs and am an avid tomato (and rose) grower. But after reading three chapters, I tossed it. The author turns out to be a left-liberal who liberally (pun intended) sprinkles his text with snide and insulting remarks about Republicans. Note to the author: Conservatives garden too."
5,Very soothing and nurturing music,"I absolutely love the CD ""Heartbeat"" and listen to it all the time, at home, at work, in the car, before going to sleep, and I never tire of it. It has a very soothing effect, and the rhythms of the heartbeats keep you in tune with your own. To me it has as much a flavor of world music as new age, which I both like very much. All in all, it's a well-done CD and fits the spirit of our time."
5,World Music with an uplifting beat. Loved it.,Great for Love making. A must for making out. Great ammbient music or crank it up and party.
1,"Dreadful, dreadful book.","Nick Pope's only claim to fame was that he was the civil servant at the MOD charged with the investigation of UFO reports there. A book that reviewed that time, with a look at the processes and in-depth coverage of one or two cases that happened during his time could have been quite entertaining and quaintly British. Unfortunately Pope believes he was not only the best person EVER in his job, but that it also gave him the authority to pronounce sagely on UFO cases through the ages, from Ezekiel to the Roswell film footage. Littered with inaccuracies of all kinds this book is badly written and a huge missed opportunity. In his desire to be sensational he ignores the lure of the mundane, a subject that, as a low ranking civil servant, he is surely most knowledgeable about."
3,I'm in the process of reading it now :,"but I find too many references to Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind (and I understand that Mr. Spielberg is in the process of returning to this forum for a new movie regarding the 'Majestic 12' papers but I haven't seen anything on it recently, does anyone know anything about this)? This book I do not think is as good as ""Alien Agenda"" by Jim Marrs (which was facinating)."
2,an ok read,"I have seen and heard alot of hype about this book and was excited to read it. I enjoyed the first part of the book, but after Casey exscaped, the book kind of lost steam to me. I was dissappointed with the ending and will not be picking up any other books by Mary Charles.The Savannah siting was pretty accurate, though."
4,Casey's Revenge,"A riveting opening. This thriller about an academic living and teaching in Savannah keeps you turning the pages--and serves as a handbook on what not to do when traveling alone! This book introduces a lovable, quirky cat, Tarka, who's a character in his own right. I hope to read more about him and our heroine.While I guessed a couple of turns in the plot (aided by skillful foreshadowing), I didn't anticipate the final sinister twist."
1,disappointment,"I can't help but wonder if the book I read was the same book the 5 star reviewers read. The characters were shallow, the plot predictable and the ""southern dialogue"" lacking. For true southern lingo read Tom Wolfe's A MAN IN FULL. For a horror story with developed characters I'll stick with Steven King."
2,bath rug review,Prodcut is of moderate quality and would most likely not purchase another one. Once washed in the washing machine the quality deteriorated quickly and it began to shed quite a lot.
5,Big fan of Mike Cross.,"My brother introduced me to his music. I have enjoyed his music for many years,as well as his humor and wit."
2,Map is not big enough.,"This map covers a small area. And as we know, the LA area is very diffuse. If you'd like a map that only covers the touristy area around the Hollywood walk of fame, go for it. The map lacked coverage of areas of the western city beach communities both central and north. The map is printed on some kind of plastic that makes it tearproof and that feature works well, but it must be an expensive material because the map's just small. There are all these inserts that cover up areas that I needed."
2,No Butter Flavor,"I love buttery popcorn like most, and I picked this up at Walmart because my Wabash Valley Farms topping has yet to get here. I thought that butter topping was supposed to taste like butter but it doesn't. I sprinkled generously and it was salty tasting but not buttery. I think I will use spray butter until my shipment arrives but there are better products out there."
1,No Flavor,"I bought this ""Butter"" flavor at the local grocery store and was very disappointed. It had no flavor at all except for a mild saltiness. You'd be better off simply using salt on your popcorn."
2,"Bland, Very Bland","I bought this to try with the newly bought hot air pop-corn, but to say it is bland is an understatement. I haven't tried it with steamed vegetables yet, but it just doesn't make sense to me that I'd have to spray butter on the popcorn so I can have the butter-salt seasoning to stick. No pun intended."
2,Not nearly as good as my old brand,"I got this because the store didn't have the brand I normally love and buy (Jolly Time Buttery Seasoning for Popcorn). This had an odd flavor, almost bitter. I maybe tasted a slight hint of butter with it, but nothing like my other seasoning. After one batch I began using my ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Extra Virgin Olive Oil"" spray first and sprinkling this powder very lightly on top of that and was more satisfied doing it that way. I will probably finish up this seasoning, but won't be buying it again."
1,I Can Believe It's Not Butter (flavored),"I believe it is generally safe to assume that ""butter-flavored"" refers to the flavor of butter churned from cow's milk. In Kernel Seasons' case, however, I'm not so sure. Kangaroo milk maybe? Or perhaps howler monkey? How about prairie dog? Whatever animal's butter this product's flavor is based on, you can bet it's not a member of the bovine family. I should know. I still have the unidentifiable taste of it in my mouth, having bought a jar and ""flavored"" some popcorn with it out of desperation because Safeway was out of my usual ""Jolly Time buttery Seasoning,"" a 12-pack of which I am now about to order to ensure that this never happens again. Thank you."
3,OK not great,"This is my first Foods Alive product. I like them, but don't like them a lot. My biggest problem is that if you eat more then two or three crackers they coat your teeth and you spend the next half hour trying to get it off with your tongue! I will buy more and will try different flavors and varities. They are better with some kind of dip or cheese then just plain in my opinion."
2,"This book was not very helpful for me, a beginner.","I was disappointed with the book. I was hoping for more of a step by step to go with what I had trouble following in my class work. More dictionary in function, I guess. I looked for the book ""After Effects for Dummies"", but Amazon didn't have it, so I bought this one."
3,Excellent learning with lots of pictures,This book is quite helpful. It covers the basics in manipulating images in After Effects and serves as a great teacher of the software.I highly recommend it.
3,"Not the best, but it's decent.","This book takes you step by step in a very methodical matter, making sure you don't get too ahead of yourself. But it kind of stops there in terms of its plus sides. Some of the downsides include the excessive use of text to illustrate simple points, and also the content/examples are uninspiring to work with. Other than that, it really covers all the basics in detail, or at least enough to get you feeling comfortable working in After Effects."
2,I must have a different book,"This is absolutely the hardest tutorial I've ever followed. Instructions as long as sixteen lines long contains several steps, yet they're not numbered. What were the authors thinking? Have they not used instructional materials before? Obviously, they're new to writing them.I have also also had the worst time trying to find the examples. I open up the Chapter 14 tutorial and get an After Effects warning: ""23 files are missing since you last saved this project"". Interesting, since I'd never opened the project. And then the tutorial doesn't work because the graphics are missing.This book gets two stars for reference, but no stars for execution. The lack of numbered steps is totally unforgiveable (I thought this would be a training manual) and the disk with the missing files is unforgivable. I've yet to find a website for file download.Buy whatever copy of the book everyone else has because mine (2nd Edition, Version 5.5) is awful."
5,Simply PACKED with valuable info,"I bought this book as a person relatively new to After Effects. Several people pointed me to ""Creating Motion Graphics"" and I can see why. This book is so stuffed with valuable information. Whether you're new to AE or experienced, this is a valuable training tool.Instructions are clear and concise. You'll learn everything from the AE interface to mattes, masking, 3D camera work, and on and on... I felt like the book had paid for itself after the first chapter (and I already kind of knew my way around the program).If you're looking for a good resource to learn After Effects, the Creating Motion Graphics series is about as good as it gets."
5,A very good guidance,"I was a total 100% newbee to After Effects!This book is great as a guidance/teacher for beginners to learn After Effects THOUROUGHLY.Sometimes it's even too detailed.The book is certainly not complex, but don't count on finishing it in a few days.This tutorial, if well folowed, will take up a month of investing some hours every day.In my opinion, a very good book if you take the time and effort to read it.It is not a quick fix!I even would suggest starting with chapter 2 and complete chapter 1 after some time, because it is actually a project covering many features which you don't understand yet.The writers however did this, i think, to motivate you, to show its power and possibilities.My advice : buy the book and take your time!Oswald"
5,AWESOME,"When I purchased this book, I knew nothing about AE. I didn't even want to look at the program without a guide to follow. I've heard plenty of great things about the Meyers and bought both the CMG volumes. So far I'm only through the first chapter and I'm amazed at how easy their instructions are to follow. I realize that AE is a complicated software to use. But by slowly going through the tutorials, I'm getting a handle of the capabilities of the software and eventually get good enough to concentrate on the creative aspects of compositing. I haven't read any of the other AE books but these two are definitely MUST HAVES."
2,service not good,"got the stand, a stand is a stand but amazon will not send a replacement wheel that was broken during shippingnow I have a broken mobile base"
2,Not feelin' this one.......Sorry BJ,"Although it was a good try, I didn't care to much for this one. I have read several of her B. Jackson's books. I liked those much better than this one. It wasn't believable, I guess. Although Renee was the one more concerned with race, I didn't see her reacting in those tense situations, nor Tag. It left me wanting to know more about Renee, even though I know it was all about the Elliot's. Ah well."
2,Sad in Ohio,"Readers, please do not judge Brenda Jackson by this book. If you really want a good read by Brenda, try ""Thorn's Challenge"". I think Ms.Jackson should have spoken to I/R couples to get a better idea of the issues they face.The characters are 2D and have no true substance... You don't really care about either one of them, Especially Renee, who was getting on my last nerves.My hope is that her newest release is better than this one.I do however have to give her props for attempting to broach a subject matter, that seems to still be taboo at the Harlequin Company, but makes up a considerable part of our population.."
3,Fair Try But Ultimately A Big Disappointment,"This is my first book by this author and I am unsure whether I would buy one of her titles again. ""Taking Care of Business"" had two really likeable lead characters, Renee and Tag. But the book itself was so trite and poorly written that it kept me from being fully engaged in their story. I agree with those who found the dialogue stilted and unbelievable. Real people simply do not talk this formally to each other. This book needed a really good editor to push the author to revise the manuscript a bit. I just kept thinking how good this book could have been."
3,ok i guess,I usually like all brendas book but i had to read this several times to like it. I hate that they couldnt have gotten married at the end of the book..i had to buy serveral other books just to see what happen with this couple :(
4,Taking Care of Business,"I loved it! Being in an inter-racial relationship for the past 14 years this book was very believable. While my husband had no doubts about our relationship, I was Renee. Still to this day, I'm the one who notices the stares, while he is completely oblivious to it. I love Brenda Jackson's books! Keep writting!"
4,Pretty good,"I enjoyed the story and was glad to know the male didn't care what others thought and went after what he wanted. Good to see the female stand up to her coworker, also. Sometimes I thought the story was dragged out, but it was still believable."
4,A quick and enjoyable read...,"If you are a fan of standard issue Silhouette and Harlequin books, then you will enjoy Ms. Jackson's new book. The author aderes to this genre's basic formula, but with a little twist. The IR theme added a little flava to the book and I read it in one sitting. Renee is a social worker and Tag is one of Manhattan's most eligible bachelors. Despite the color difference, they decide to persue a relationship with each other. This decision leads to malicious gossip by coworkers and has Renee rethinking whether she wants to remain involved with Tag. Tag does his best to put her at ease, but Renee ultimately has to come to terms with the implications of their relationship on her own. Does she follow her heart or bow down to what society dictates is proper. Delaney's Desert Sheikh was far better, but this book did not disappoint me."
4,EXPECTING TOO MUCH WHEN ITs IR,"I've never wrote a review before but felt base on the other reviews I had to write one myself.I have every book Ms. Jackson ever wrote and this one, like the others, was very satisfying. I felt she kept it real while at the same time keeping the romance alive. I really find it a bit ""ridiculous"" to think base on Tag's social standing and race that this book should only be about their personality and regular relationship issues. On the other end of the ""extreme"" to say she should have made it a non-issue is really unrealistic.My only complaint was that I needed her heroine to be stronger like her previous character."
4,Interracial Story,It's nice to know that one of your favorite writers can deliver a good story about interracial couples. Ms Jackson points out the problems that this couple encounters when trying to establish a relationship. I enjoy reading these types of stories. I also like to see how the author will write a story involving interracial couples. I know first hand what the experience is like. Its good to read a good book involving this issue. This book does not disappoint.
4,Fripp unleashed,"Assuming you're already familiar with the works of Fripp and those of King Crimson, this cd is intense improv along the general musical lines of, say, Larks Tongues in Aspic Part 3. Unlike the spacey, noodling Space Groove (Projekct 2), which reminds me of a sorta' spacey wordless ""Dig Me"", these are much more funk driven intense jams. In my opinion, this particular cd represents some of Fripp's best work of the past ten years, particularly because he takes center stage. Even Belew is at his best playing percussion and some nice supporting guitar. Tracks 5, 6, 11, 13, 14, and 15 all belong on an Essential Fripp collection. They are like Absent Lovers' ""Sartori in Tangier"" with hints of USA's ""Asbury Park."""
5,Unfiltered Music,"This CD is about as accessible as sheet metal being run through a shredder, but accessibility is not the point of this ""Projekct"". It actually gave me a headache the first time i heard it all the way through. But after the second listen I was hooked. The riffs and rhythms hold no cliches, just pure KC Madness. Intimidating to me as a musician, beautiful to me as a listener. Even though the majority of this Disc was a cut and paste recording by Pat and Trey (found this out from ""In The Court of King Crimson"" by Sid Smith) These four men all played this music, and the results are remarkable. This for me was a worthy makeup for the minor disappointment of TCOL, and worth the money to anyone who thinks beyond pop idiocy and into avant-garde brilliance."
3,Where Are The Extras?,"I'm not sure what's happening. The packaging on the first three Farscape disks was superb. However, disk four has NO COMMENTARIES! I hope ADV (Who should either lower the price or put more episodes per disk) is not going cheap on us. Another thing, I thought that ADV was releasing one disk a month (which is far too slow anyway) and now I see that the release date for disk 5 is September! Hey ADV...you have a lot of fans out here that love the show...don't screw us over, please. One more thing...why does the UK seem to get preferntial treatment with the releases? I just checked Amazon UK and they are into the end of Season One if not Season Two by now! C'mon guys, picki it up. Two star loss for loss of two commentary tracks."
3,It gets 3 stars because...,"...they didn't bother to put in commentaries for both episodes this time. Farscape is an excellent show but they could have done much better with the DVD release. Yes, a boxed set would be wonderfull--I have heard that the first season of the Simpsons will be released in one set--all episodes with commentaries! It is time for ADV to ""get the head out!""On the flip side (no pun intended--the DVD is single sided!), it is soooooo nice to have the quality that DVD offers. My wife and I catch Farscape on SciFi, and the satelite picture quality doesn't even come close to that of DVD, needless to say."
3,Farscape,"I am a big fan of the show, but even I have my limits. I really can't see paying over 100.00 for 10 episodes (Five discs). This will be my last purchase from the thieves at ADV. I know they have to make a profit . . . but come on."
2,2 stars for 2 shows,"Henson & Co. is has taken lessons in greed and arrogance from Paramount/Viacom and only offering 2 episodes per DVD. What a rip!! They should take lessons instead from HBO and Fox and offer entire seasons (like Sex In The City, Sopranos and X-Files) in a single package. Overall it's cheaper and more appealing to the consumer, which is why those packages are always near the top in Amazon's Top Seller's list instead of Trek/Farscape."
2,"Great Episodes, Poor DVD",It is a bit of a rip to only release 2 episodes per DVD. I was dealing with that fine. The commentary tracks on the past DVDs made up for it a bit. This one has NO extras at all and yet is still priced like the prior ones. ADV and Jim Henson should be ashamed. I think I will stick with my dub tapes rather than get this DVD. I returned mine. Sad to say though that people are still going to buy these no mater how overpriced they are. The episodes on here are great though. PK Tech Girl develops some of the emotions between Aeryn and John. That Old Black Magic shows some of Zahn's dark past.
2,Skimping on the extras!,"While the first 3 DVDs had entertaining audio commentaries on the episodes, the 4th DVD does not. Indeed, the ""extras"" are production designs and a D'Argo profile, of which half of the footage is recycled from eariler DVD extra footage.Given that they are only putting 2 episodes on each DVD, this really felt like they are socking it to us. I was rather ticked about the whole deal. If it wasn't such a great series, I would never contemplate buying another DVD. As it is, they better not skimp on the extras on the future DVDs, or they will have one fewer customer in me. :("
3,episodes should be bundled!,"it doesn't make sense to sell 2 episodes per disc. episodes should be bundled. however, it's unlikely that adv films will wake up...so don't look for a box set any time soon."
2,Great shows but why only 2 and not the whole season?,Lets be realistic. Why is that all other shows are going the route of a one price/ whole season dvd system? It's fair to the consumer and a cash cow for the producers and retailers. However why does farscape decide to grab their loyal viewers by the ankles and shake them until all their money falls out of their pockets? It just doesn't make sense. They won't get anymore of my money until they change their system. Do the same and hopefully we will all get rewarded with a clean and easy purchasing system and a fair price. The shows are great but at this price and this system they are worth the wait.
2,Only Two Episodes?,"I love Farscape, and PK Tech Girl is a fantastic episode, so when I heard that they were releasing the episodes on DVD, I was ready to rush out and buy them. Until I realized they were charging [price] for two episodes, with no extras. Having bought the magnificent X-Files boxed sets for less than [price] each, I can't bring myself to justify the expense. I have the same problem with the old Star Trek episodes. Why would I spend that much when I can tape any of these episodes off the television? Give me a season boxed set, or at least some noteworthy outtakes or extras, and I would love to get these DVDs. Until then, I'll just stick with the my episode recordings...."
2,Write Showtime,"I agree with the other reviewers who are disappointed that this DVD only contains the pilot episode. I truly enjoyed this series and was looking forward to season two. I am still stunned that this only lasted for one season. Especially with how it ended...All that aside, my suggestion is to go to www.sho.com and ask them to do one or both of the following: a) release the entire first season on DVD, and/or b) re-air the entire first season so that we can record it.Surely that can at least do (b) rather than show something like C.H.O.M.P.S. or Bikini Summer 3."
3,Heavily edited version of the original,"While the basic story is till there, and it is quite interesting, what is available here could show on NBC. If you're looking for the original, full-length version, this isn't it! It's not just 'edited for content'....several complete scenes are missing."
1,Out Of Order.. ? incomplete is more accurate !,"I was so excited when I saw this title released on DVD. I then foolishly puchased it not knowing they ruined it, and released it as a poor mini-movie of the Showtime series. I still cannot believe how Showtime butchered this wonderful series into to 90 odd minutes of total garbage. Is it any wonder why Showtime always places a distant second to HBO on all of their productions ?"
2,All these years and still no release of the rest of the series?,It's been SEVEN YEARS (soon to be eight!) since this SERIES aired and still only the pilot episode is released!!! WTF?!?!?
2,tman,"A couple of parts was missing from this movie, that why I gave it two stars, the worst thing is to watch a movie and parts of themovie is missing."
1,Mediocre surfing by snotty stupid adolescence.,Mediocre surfing by snotty stupid adolescence. The worst part of this film is the ego jacked attitude these kids portray. In between knocking the cultures of the places the travel they show clips of people being jumped and beat up. I'm surprised surfer magazine helped produce crap. I'm throwing it in the trash.
2,So disapointed !,"Je viens de recevoir le DVD et à ma grande surprise, ce n'est que le pilote ! Bad information...there's nothing in the purchase of the DVD that says its only the pilot ! What about the six episodes ! The pilot is good but i want more !!"
1,out of order,It was a great show. the pilot was good but the rest was better.Pleeeeze release the rest of the series!
1,Indulgent and painfully boring!,This was one of the worst shows that has ever been on television. The husband and wife in this movie were so whiney and self-indulgent. The couple had a bazillion dollars and did nothing but complain about their lives. I can't stand Eric Stoltz because he is such a milk toast. Felicity Huffman comes across in this movie and in Desperate Housewives as someone with absolutely no moral center. TV and movies about TV and movie writers is just lame to begin with. Don't waste your time or money on this shlock.
2,Awful!,"Though this movie depicted the reality of some marriages, it was awful. It has way too much sexual things in it, which seems to be the entire movie! I don't find this good or interesting at all. Watch a real movie that has a story line like the Pianst. I enjoyed that. But if you want to see two naked people doing it in the pool, watch this movie. If u want to see two naked people doing it in bed, watch this. If u want to see a guy cheat on his depressed wife, watch this......."
5,The New American Story,"As we head into the 2008 elections, this book is a must read. Senator Bradley's insight into today's social and political problems are very enlightening. Although the Senator is known as a liberal Democrat, this book is well worth reading by independents and moderate Rebublicans as well."
5,Book review,"I'd heard Bill Bradley speak about his book on a television show. I found the discussion informative and purchased the book. The book contains factual data about our economy, our government policy successes and failures, current practices, and how the rest of the world views us. I have found that it has so much information that I have reread some of the pages."
5,I couldn't put this down!!!!!,This book was so good I literally could not put it down!!! I was up until three in the morning reading this book. The story is so interesting that I found myself cheering for Faith and cursing Resse when he did something utterly stupid. This is a must read!
4,light and fun reading,"I love the 'Free Fellow League' series and this book is a worthy part of it.Love, adventure and a little smuggling, what else could you want?"
4,unsettling but with a measure of power,"An odd novel, Blood Tie has some stretches which leave the reader wondering where this novel is going, if at all. Yet through some clever moves, Settle makes the novel redeem itself, if the reader can hang on through some midcourse excursions. The strongest part of the work is Settle's exploitation of the theme of blood (as in the title) which gets strung along throughout, from hand prints on a cave wall, to the bloody body of a beating victim. The moral is, I suppose, that sacrifice is sacrifice, and in the modern world, the results can be very ambiguous indeed. In a world where people are being squeezed by internal and external forces they can't control, what is the point of sacrifice, in any form, at all?"
5,Grace Notes CD,"This CD is an incredible listening experience for anyone who likes bagpipe music. Robert Mathieson is a genius on the instrument. Talk about ""great hands""."
3,Very Concise and objective.,Very concise and accurate text. Prof. Craig introduces the fundamental concepts of soil mechanics in a very objective way.
5,Pure Lisening Pleasure,Our TIme in Eden is easily one of the Manics best efforts ever. Natalie's voice alone is worth the price of this CD as her uniquely beautiful voice and elegant style serve to give the songs a richer texture. The lyrics are deep and meaningful while remaining catchy and easy to remeber for the sing along crowd like in Candy EveryBody wants and THese are The Days and at other times the lyrics are heartfelt and personal as in I'm not the Man and How you've Grown.
4,"Lovely, if unastonishing","If there's ever been one flaw in either Natalie Merchant's or 10,000 Maniacs's music, it's been Merchant's commitment to create ""irony-free, genuine"" music - it's always been a little depthless. In that, there aren't many dimensions to Our Time In Eden - ""Tolerance"" is about tolerance, ""These are Days"" are about... how these are days you'll remember. Yet those songs are lovely and effortless, as Merchant's voice was never better, a constant soft and assuring presence throughout the album's set of flawlessly produced songs. And for the most part, that's plenty for a record to offer, especially one as gorgeously listenable as Our Time in Eden. My favorites, the cautionary tale of ""Noah's Dove,"" and ""Gold Rush Brides,"" which takes material from Women's Diaries of Westward Journies and makes it the stuff of accessible pop and not frontier education."
4,A great album,"After seeing the video for ""These Are Days"" I decided I'd be daring and pick up my first 10,000 Maniacs CD. I didn't regret it. Though I don't listen to it as much as I did before I assure you that it is extremely enjoyable. It's a great introduction to the band. The opening track is suberb. The last minutes of ""Jezebel"" are my favorite parts of the cd. This is a great CD to have on if you have a lot on your mind and need soothing background music."
4,How they've grown.,"I know alot of people love the ""In My Tribe"" album, and my favorite might be ""Blind Man's Zoo"", but I think this is their best, and is easily their most popular album. ""Our Time In Eden"" benefited by coming out at the height of the alternative craze, and ""These Are Days"" seemed to be a theme for more than a few people I knew. That was the big hit, but ""Candy Everybody Wants"" was another, as well as a few minor hits that made their ""Unplugged"" and ""Campfire Songs"" collections. By the time of this release, 10,000 Maniacs had really become more adult-alternative rock than college-rock, and you can hear where Natalie Merchant was headed on her first solo album in 1995. No complaint though, this is all good stuff. Personal favorites of mine would be the opener ""Noah's Dove"" and ""Circle Dream"", both beautiful and catchy. Truth is, they were/are a wonderful band, and any of the above mentioned albums are a joy to hear."
5,ahh College days...,"This CD was a soundtrack to my college years although it came out long before I made it to school. Classic, timeless songs and amazing singing makes it one of my top CD's of all time. I love you Natalie! Anyone in need of music for the soul should get this disc and just listen - elleng"
4,Spy thriller in North West USA,"If you are looking for a spy thriller set in a different location, then this is it."
3,Nirmama,3 1/2Short and mostly sweet rough-edged guitar catchiness can compete with some of Deal's best Pixies output on many of her own group's Albini-inflected stronger tracks (specifically the first half and Iris of course) but lacks the overall melodic deconstructionist vision which made LS so memorable.
4,"Not so bad, not so good","A work that resents some fact of to be a disk carved alone for fun, it is had in fact the idea that the arrangements are pulled a little road. However in back lighting it is seen clear the talent of kim deal, uncontested heroin of the American antimainstream"
5,Effing great,All right so p'haps not a massive departure from the Pixies. Smoother round the edges and quieter I grant you. Still one of my favourite albulms after three years of ownership. I couldn't pick out a highlight it starts of great and ends fantastic! Pod also contains one of the greatest Beatles covers ever. BUY BUY BUY!
4,My review,This album is so original and so emotionally powered. It's like nothing I've ever heard. Sometimes the music treads into dungeons of emotional gloom and sometimes it jumps out into poppy happy tones of rock. This album is well worth your time and money if you are a Breeders/Pixies fan. I can see why Kurt Cobain liked this album.
3,Listen more than once,If you enjoyed Last Splash and Title TK then eventually you'll enjoy this work by the Breeders as well. But don't expect to be completely blown away like with Last Splash. This work took me several listens to get into it. Over all though it's worth looking into!
3,Pod people,"An interesting album. It sounds more like a singles collection than a cohesive album, but Kim Deals voice makes up for it."
5,Good enough for any Collection,"The series 13 figure, ""Tuxedo Krusty"" shows Krusty with a newspaper that reads, ""Gabbo Here Today"", a Pink Mug with his face on it, a Microphone, and Krustys Pacemaker. You can get this cheap now for about $6 so I would recommend getting it now because it'll be more expensive later on."
2,Unhappy with tape instead of CD,"I ordered what I believed was a CD for a friend and what came was a tape. When I looked at the list of choices I believed it was for CD's only. She can't use the tape for a workshop she is giving and is writing the sender. Is there anything you can do about it? Thanks, Barbara Baron, bhb444@att.net, 805 646-2309."
3,Jackie Chan's The Myth,I love Jackie Chan and Jet Li movies. This one of Jackie's was alright but not a great one. It's worth watching just because it has Jackie Chan in it.
5,One of my favorites starring Jackie Chan,"Even though I watched this movie for free on Hulu I ended up purchasing it from Amazon for my parents (mom is a huge fan of martial arts movies). I found the back story fascinating, the humor was great, the fights were creative and different, some of which I have never seen before (i.e. rat glue factory scene). CGI scenes of the horses kicking were horrible but forgivable. There were some plot holes and the music was sometimes a little over dramatic (the scene where the princess and jack are floating together through the air) but I still rated this movie five stars because I loved it anyway."
4,Eve,The delivery was on time and in excellent condition.We love Jackie Chan movies. Great Action. I don't want to spoil the ending for you!
4,Jackie Chan fan,if you like jackie chan movies you should like this moviei like most of his movies and this one didn't disappoint
4,World class family viewing,"Jackie Chan's action choreography only keeps getting better and I have to keep asking how does he do it as he keeps getting older?That aside, the action is amazingly slick and not CGI'ed to death.The film as a whole is an enjoyable family-viewing action movie. Recommended for father's of young boys."
2,not worth,the rental. It was just boring and terrible. The acting stank and the dialogue won't keep you glued to the screen. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.
1,Wouldn't Play,It wouldn't even play on my DVD player. So basically it was a total waste of my money.
3,"Indi-""Chan""-a Jones style martial arts film","How could I resist the baaad pun? ""Myth"" is actually a renamed Chinese film from 2005 called ""San Wa.""Briefly, Jack (Chan) is an archaeologist who dreams of a past life as a General (Meng Yi) in Ancient China.When he's asked by a colleague, William (Tony Leung Ka Fai) to help find a scientfic discovery relating to defying gravity, Jack returns to China and faces his dream princess Ok-soo (Hee-seon Kim) and his own past failure as the General to protect her.The story's a bit of Indiana Jones and a bit of the fallen Samurai myth. I very rarely watch subtitled films, but ""Myth"" was easy enough to follow and provided enough amusement to make the rental worthwhile."
5,absolute yum,"First let me say that I tend to favor Newman's Own dressings because I have problems with high fructose corn syrup causing me joint pain and with Newman's I know it won't be an issue. I can trust if without checking labels constantly. Also recently read not to use fat free dressing as the vitamins in salad need the fat for absorption so now I buy regular dressings. That said, the Family Recipe Italian has got to be the best italian salad dressing we have ever tried. Many italian dressings are strong and overpowering, but not this one. While it has plenty of flavor, it does not hide the flavor of the lettuce, tomatoes, etc."
2,lies this update copy,I do have the two copies of this game the REGULAR COD-2 AND COD-2 game of the year. becuase is really good .on single player as on line play but I regret to buy the game of the year version because the extra content on the secong disk is no more than garbage.but the game is shine star for himself even for solo campain or onlne play CALL OF DUTY 2 IS A CLASSIC GAME .
3,poor choice of music for a superb pianist!,"Excellent performances - spoiled by including the juvenile Chopin variations on one of Mozart's most beautiful operatic creations - the duet ""La ci darem la mano"" from DonGiovanni. Chopin loved the piece, but trashed it with this opus. As a Curtis School student assignment it would rate a D-. Maybe it's fun to play, but it is painful for an opera fan to listen to!"
5,what a nice surprise,For the price i had to give it a shot. Opened it and was surprised it worked so well.Immediately ended up sharpening every knife and scissor in the house i could find!
4,Great tool in the kitchen,"After toting my cooking knives around in my car to drop off at the sharpening shop, never seeming to catch them open, I decided to try again at home. I chose the AccuSharp 001 and was very happy with it to say the least. Within minutes I was slicing and dicing again with ""new"" knives. Very happy. Would recommend them hands down."
4,Works as advertised. Great value!,"This sharpener works as advertised and as reviewed on this site. It brings an incredibly sharp edge back to knives and is really very easy to use.However, the reality is (as some have pointed out) that the sharp edge does not last very long. The truth is though, it is so easy to use, who cares? Just a few swipes and you're ready to go again. I find sharpening with stones very time consuming and it does require practice and skill to do right, which is why I don't do it very often. This sharpener allows my knives to have more consistent sharp edges for longer periods of time because I'm willing to take 20 seconds every other day and give whatever knife I'm using a few swipes.Great value."
5,Brilliant Tool!,I had no idea my knives were so dull until I used this bad-boy on them; they are SCARY sharp now after spending all of 6 minutes going through my small collection! Really nothing more to say...buy it!
4,Great kitchen tool,"For the price this is a wonderful tool. I've used it to sharpen serrated as well as non-serrated blades without issue. If you are looking for an easy, cost-effective way to sharpen your knives you can't go wrong with this item."
4,Easy to use!,"I really like this product. I see instant results on the knives I use most often and the product is easy and safe to use. It's been over 8 months and I have had to sharpen my knives 3x so far. After a few more uses, I will have to rotate the blades and that will probably last another year or so. Great value for the price."
5,BEST knife sharpener out there. !!!,I have purchased maybe 25 or 30 of these over the past 10 years after someone showed me how simply INCREDIBLE this product works. I give them away as gifts.
5,Dull knives - buy this now!,I love to cook and so do my friends who recommended this over any other knife sharpener. Now I can slice tomatoes safely and thinly. It's works just great and the price can't be beat. Makes a fun gift too!
4,Working well,It is working really well. And made our knifes back to work. It is also safe and easy to use.
5,Excellent product,"It's great to have sharp knives again!!Excellent product, it's pretty small too which is great.Just be careful you don't cut yourself after using this as you knives will be very sharp!!!"
5,"Quick, Easy and It Really Works!","As soon as I received the sharpener I tried it on my pocket knife, within a few minutes the knife was razor sharp. On a roll, I hit the kitchen knives and the knife block. Serrated or not, all the knives were as sharp or sharper than new. It really is simple to use, requires very little effort and definetly WORKS GREAT."
5,Love it.,I just got this sharpener after looking in real stores for days and not finding one on sale. It arrived and I did about 30 passes over each knife I have. I cut a tomato like it was made of butter... I love it.
4,AccuSharp Knife Makes the Grade,"Works great, good price. Knew it was good when I saw it used at a food stand at our local fair."
3,Knife sharpener,"Product I received was not like the picture I ordered from,but productdoes what it is designed for. Be careful using and follow instuctionsclosely and do not attempt to sharpen knife the wrong way as a slip in using product could cause cutting ones self badly."
3,Works ok for inexpensive knives,"This is fine if you are sharpening a cheap knife or your pocket knife. In my opinion, I would not use this on fine cutlery (like my Shun knives). It leaves a very rough edge."
4,Great sharpener value.,"I have used several sharpeners over the years, and this one does the best job for the least money. It is new to my home, so I don't know how long it will perform this well, but for this price, you buy a couple of new ones a year and still be ahead."
5,cheap and effective,"doesn't work as well on serrated knives as it does regular knives, but if i read the instructions it would have probably told me not to use it on those types of knives.. other than that, it shaved off some steel and BAM knives are pretty dang sharp.. people have been trying to borrow the thing but i think the sharpener is only good so many sharpens so i'm keepin it."
4,My knives are sharp.,This sharpener is very easy to use. It sharpened my knives very quickly and with little effort.
5,Best sharpener ever,We are going to have to order extras for gifts so that our family and friends will leave ours alone. Our son had fun sharpening our knives when he visited at Christmas. Just a few swipes and it is done. Next we are going to try the Accusharp scissor version.UPDATE: 12/3/2011We did order a bunch of the Accusharp gifts for our friends and family. Everyone loves them and they still use them with great success.
4,Easy to use sharpener,"This will put a sharp edge on most things you'd like a sharp edge on fairly quickly and easily, however it shears more metal off the blade than other sharpening methods. The edge it produces is sharp enough for most purposes, however is not ""razor"" sharp."
5,A great low cost sharpener!!,This was reccommended by Cooks Illustrated Mag so I expected the best! They were spot on about their assessment. A really good -low cost sharpener which is only needed occasionally if you also use a knife honer each time you use your knife. Highly reccommended!!
5,Bloody Sharp,I was at a friends sharpening an INCREDIBLY dull knife. I was moving the blade and not the sharpener because my friend is a dick and lied to me. I cut my wrist open after a couple of strokes. It worked amazingly well even though i wish it didn't.
2,Good Tool Poor Warranty,"I've had this tool for several years and it works well in my shop, no complaints.The blades have been reversed and finally seen their last days. I called the company to ask for new blades. They insist on $4 and a return of the original tool. I reminded them that I can buy a new tool for this price or less at my local building supply dealer. All I need is the two blades taped to a piece of cardboard and sent in an envelope. No! to get replacement blades, you have to buy a new tool.While this is stated on the original card, although the price was $3, this is very poor customer service.If the tool itself were damaged, e.g., broken, it would make sense but not replaceable blades.A warranty is defined as:A written guarantee, issued to the purchaser of an article by its manufacturer, promising to repair or replace it if necessary within a specified period of time.The customer needs blades, not a handle. Not a big costly item, just bad service."
5,"so simple, so effective",Very handy to have the sharpener around. A few trips can get your knife back to be sharp.
5,Brilliant Little Kitchen Utility,"If you have knifes in your kitchen you need this too. Taking the knifes in for a sharpening is quite cumbersome and expensive, this little thing does this for you in just a couple of swipes. I can't believe that this is so cheap. There isn't much material on this thing to be expensive, but the concept is a sure winner. The finger guard takes the nervousness out of using this device, but still you would need to be very clumsy to cause an accident using this sharpener.To make the sharpness last longer, just file your knife a couple of times when you are done chopping or slicing. But if that doesn't do it, then use your AccuSharp. I've found out just a few swipes are most effective."
4,Manual Knife Sharpener,"I found the product to be very easy to use, very quick and my kitchen knives are noticeably sharper. The little device resides in the utensil drawer and takes up little space."
3,Has its uses but nothing special,"I bought this on a whim and wasn't expecting much. I will point out the good and the bad here. Good: Easy to use. Does a good job at getting really dull knives most of the way there. Easy to change sharpening blades. Bad: I can get a knife sharp enough on a whetstone to shave hairs off my arm. Not so with this tool. As I say it is a good first step but not a final step if you want a really sharp knife. Also the blades dull very quickly. I got through 4 knives and it was already noticeably worn. Finally, it works best with thick knife blades; on thin knives- like boning or fillet knives- it isn't so great.Buy it for what it is and you won't be disappointed. But don't expect it to do what a good whetstone will."
4,Best Sharpener on the market,This is the best knife sharpener on the market. I got my Dad one for Fathers Day and one for myself. I use to have one like it but when my wife left she decided to take it with her.
5,This thang actually works!,"I was frankly rather incredulous of all the wonderful praises that I had seen for this product, but decided to try one, thinking it's only ten bucks to lose if it does not work.But, whoa, this thang does work! It is amazing how the sharpness returns to the blade of a knife in just a single swipe with this sharpener. I nearly sliced my index finger off by trying to check the knife's condition with my hand, believing that there was no way that the dullness would go away so easily. It did. This is an amazing little contraption. Get one for your household. You will be glad."
5,Great Sharpener for the Money,This sharpener is awesome for the average person with an average set of knives. It got my crappy walmart farberware knives sharp enough that I was shaving my arm hair with them. I have found that lightly dragging it over the blade 4 or 5 times is enough to take it from somewhat dull to a very fine edge. Just remember to use your honing steel to keep your blades sharp so you don't have to use this too much.
3,Knife sharpener,The product appears to work but I now think a sharpening stone would work just as well/ My knives are still not as shapr as desired
4,Works well,I was tired of my knives being dull all the time and just wanted something small and simple to get them sharpened. This seemed like a good solution though I was skeptical because it was really inexpensive and I thought it might not work. But it works very well and is easy for even a chicken like me to use (I'm always petrified of cutting my hands on the knives.) I think it's a good product and very good price.
2,I don't understand how this works.,I tried all my dull knifes on it and none of them is actually as sharp as i like. I ended taking my knifes to a profesional who made them razor sharp again with his tools. to me my knifes should be razor sharp anything less is pointless. I prefer cutting throw stuff with minimum effort.
2,"It's ""so-so""","The sharpness didn't last very long. And when I tried to find replacement blades, it was difficult. I probably won't buy this product again."
4,"Great value, excellent sharpener!","Doesn't put the sharpest edge on all knives, some better than others, but it does last and is easy to use. I've sharpened everything I could, even the ""knife"" you can find on some cheap wine openers, some really old knock-off swiss-army knives and even some bulk ""cheap-o"" knives. Some took some effort because they didn't have much of a edge to begin with, or had been worn down my misuse... nonetheless this sharpener was able to breath new life into each one of them. Most kitchen or pocket knifes will work great with this sharpener, serrated knifes are always tough, and this sharpener does OK on them, really depends on the serration... so I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5, it's a real good deal and I've used it on dozens of knifes/scissors/letter openers etc..."
4,Nice Sharpener,"I looked at many different sharpeners and different sharpening options before finally deciding on this item. I'm sure that whetstones, sharpening rods, and belt sharpeners are better because you can choose your edge and achieve better angles, but regardless, this is extremely easy to use and it has worked really well for pocket knives and kitchen knives. I have not used it on serrated edges as of yet, so I have no input on its uses for that, but as far as straight edges go, it does a good job at restoring edges to dull knives. I will say that it will probably not restore factory sharpness, but for the ease of use and how quickly this works, it is an efficient compromise."
2,I think the makers spammed this product,"Having used this item for a few months now, it seems that the rave reviews are somewhat undeserved. The product puts a mildly decent edge on my blades, though it doesn't seem to last. I have read other places where it might have to do with the angle, though I can't say for sure. Additionally, it does not feel like a quality item, but I expected that for the most part considering the cost.What I can't figure out is how this thing is so well reviewed. My only guess is that the makers got people to spam this item with their own positive reviews to get more sales. Also, when checking other reviews left by some of the reviewers (there is a link by the persons name that says 'See all my reviews'), I found that several had not left reviews on any other items. What are the odds that so many people would be compelled to leave reviews only for this item on Amazon?"
3,Does not sharpen well,"I've used this for several months, and can just not get my knives sharp with it.Purchased 2 when I ordered, and the person that received it has the same complaint. Don't know if we got a bad batch or if the product design has changed. Other reviewers love it and that was why I ordered it.Very disappointing.Instead, I recommend taking your knives to a professional for sharpening.If anyone has other alternatives, I'd love to hear about them in my comments. Thanks."
5,The Best Knife Sharpener....Ever,"After purchasing numerous knife sharpeners that never seemed to work, I took a chance and ordered the 001 Knife Sharpener from Accusharp. I am beyond pleased that I discovered this product. My knifes are even sharper than the last time I had the local knife sharpener sharpen them. It is incredibly easy to use and the guard does a good job of ensuring that you don't cut yourself.My only disappoint was when I ran out of things to sharpen."
4,Very handy,I find this sharpener very handy and more reliable than my steel. I think the best edge can be gotten using both of them together.
5,Accusharp- a kitchen necessity!,"I am a Chef, and have always scoffed at these types of sharpeners, but this one really works. Follow the instructions, use a soft touch, and keep the knives and sharpener clean, and you will be very happy the the results."
5,Super,"I cook a great deal, but keeping my knives sharp was a hassle, I usually took them to a store to have them done. Expensive and a lot of time consumed. I found this here hoping to find a solution. It's simple, costs not a lot, and does a super job of keeping things on a keen edge!. Buy it you won't be sorry."
4,AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener,"Excellent sharpener. Easy to use, great results with just a few strokes.I had a similar unit that I bought about 15 years ago. It finally wore out; replaced with the AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener.Now my kitchen and pocket knives are back with VERY sharp edges. Expect the new unit to last quite a while too. Worth the price.Edit Mar 2012:After using this for a while, I notice it does odd things to the edges of my cooking knives. The edges are uneven and have some debris left behind after using the sharpener. It does a good-enough job for a quick refresh on a working knife, but isn't producing any kind of high-quality edge. I may take this out to the garage for my garden tools and look for something better for the good knives. FWIW."
5,Works great !,"It does work nicely,I use it with my victorinox chef knives and it does the job.It also feels pretty safe to use,I was never good with using regular knife sharpeners.Highly reccomended !"
4,Works Better Than I Expected,"I forget the price I paid, but it was only a few bucks. I really didn't anticipate much for it. But, after researching all of the knife sharpener options (most of which were very expensive and with only mixed reviews), I decided this was worth trying.It works well on my mid-range-to-high end kitchen knives. I haven't tried it on serrated knives. A tip: If your knives are quite dull, it helps to get a good edge quicker if you tilt the sharpener slightly to one side of the blade when drawing it down, and then doing the same with a reverse tilt. Do this few times and then finish with a few straight passes. Do follow the instructions and wash the knives after sharpening and before using. And, use a light touch...do not press down hard."
5,Sometimes simpler is better,"The knife sharpener in the Kitchen drawer had gotten old & tired, & I didn't want to spend excessive $$$ on a new one, so I gave this little unit a try. Well, it may not be the most hi tech looking, or something that needs to be plugged in, but it works smoothly & easily. A few passes & WOW ! Edges that could slice through paper, I felt like I could do my own infomercial extoling this thing. I got one for the Kitchen & also one for the garden tools, one of the best buys I've made at Amazon."
5,Amazing!,"This gizmo is pretty amazing. I thought I was going to have to spend $100+ to get a decent edge on my kitchen knives, but this thing does an amazing job for the price. As another reviewer said, if you want to be able to shave with your knives keep looking, but if you want to put and keep a keen edge on most of your knives look no further. Better yet, it's extrememly easy to use and cheap enough to keep one in the kitchen (without taking up valuable counter space) and one in your tool or tackle box.Just got it, and sharpened all of my good kitchen knives in about 5 minutes total. Sharper than they've been in a long time, and I have a lot of sharpening gadgets which will probably be on eBay tomorrow."
3,Merely OK,"This product is adequate for cheap cutlery. The build quality is rather low but considering the cost this is forgiveable. I bought it to help keep my machete sharp. If you have high quality knives and are looking for a real sharpener, consider the excellent Spyderco Tri-Angle Sharpmaker or the Edge Pro Apex."
5,The BEST!,"The AccuSharp Knife Sharpeners , both the one for smaller knives and the one for larger kitchen knives have been simply super! Easy to use, the resulting sharp blades could be used for shaving! We sent both to our distant families for Christmas and have received 5-star compliments!"
5,a SHARP utensil!,"I have purchased many knife sharpeners from a sharpening stone to an electric one. I have found that this inexpensive, light sharpener works as well or better than any of those I have purchased. Once you get accustomed to the sharpening position it is most easy to use, and the results are excellent. Even though it is not necessary, I usually sharpen the knife I am about to use each time and the cutting process becomes an easy one. Thanks Amazon!!"
4,Puts on the final edge.,"This put the final edge on all my knives, from the kitchen blades to a pocket knife.Also used it on a 6"" serrated kitchen knife and it seemed to have worked. Followed the instructions on the box.This may not be the right product to get a dull knife all the way back to sharpness, but it works as a later stage sharpener."
4,"Cheap, and works","Yes, it's cheap. And, yes, it works. I was actually suprised how well it works! It may not last as long as I want, but for the price, it can't be beat."
1,Not sure that it works,"Tried to sharpen my scissors, and the tool made them even more blunt. I followed the instructions on how to use..."
1,AccuSharp Knife Sharpener,I remember I paid only $.99 for this Sharpener......... Don't get me wrong it works good but not for $9.99........... AccuSharp can make it for $1.00.........
1,Disappointed in performance,Very disappointed in the performance.Does not work as advertised. I have no idea where they get the positive customer comments from.
3,Not what was pictured,"As of June, 2011, you will (instead) get almost an exact duplicate of Amazon's ""Accu Sharp 008 OD Green Knife Sharpener""..instead of the one pictured."
2,Not that good.,"For a thick bladed cheap knife it does an ok job, but for something with a finer edge or a thinner type Asian blade it's nothing short of junk that will do harm. No I would not buy it again."
2,almost cut off my thumb,"very awkward to manage, and while it has a guard, it did not help me from slippage and almost cutting off my thumb....not a good design, and my scissors are worse off after trying to sharpen them....surprised as America's Test Kitchen recommended"
2,1 star Enough!,Not made &#8203;&#8203;diligently ..Consists of two pieces of plastic glued to each other do not match you will find the above point from the other
4,Accusharp 001 knife sharpener,"I searched for a basic knife sharpener and came across this Accusharp 001 knife sharpener, ordered it because it looked simple enough for my uses and was reasonably priced. It sharpens very quickly and easily. I am very satisfied with it and my knives are very evenly sharp."
4,Good for less expensive knives,"This workd far better than the other knife sharpening gizmos I've collected over the years. I bought it specifically to salvage some old dull knives. It does a fine job.I would hesitate to use it on my better blades because as others have pointed out, it shaves a lot of metal off the edge."
4,Simple and effective,"I use my pocket knives all the time on the job. Even though I use it for cutting open packages, I enjoy the fact that I can go home, grab this sharpener and restore my knife in a couple of swipes. The sharpener feel's cheap, but does a great job!"
5,Sharpener,So far I really like this. Small enough to handle and sharpens the knives nicely. Another item I would consider for a gift.
4,Hard to beat for the money.,You won't be able to shave the hair off your arms but for general kitchen use and quick touch up of a hunting knife it's hard to beat it for the price.
5,Love this!,"I thought I was going to have to spend alot of money for a decent knife sharpener. After reading the great reviews, I bought it and love it. It's extremely quick and easy to use and sharpens my knives beautifully."
5,Weightless and Savagely Sharp,"Apparently these don't have the longevity that the company purports, but wow does it make a razor sharp blade. Most knifes only take a few strokes to go from dull to completely sharp, like it's kind of extraordinary. I used this and the little Smith pocket tool back to back, and the ceramic edges for the Smith tool (never used before) kept dulling the sharp edge that the AccuSharp made. This tool has made me a big big fan of what a mousetrap sharpener can do. This has to be the most effective sharpener for the $ in the world."
5,It works!!,I purchased this based on a review in Cook's Illustrated. I was surprised how well just a cheap product worked. I used it about once a week and my knifes stay very sharp.
1,No better way to screw up a blade...,"All this so-called ""sharpener"" managed to do was turn decent but worn edges into ragged, gouged crap. Don't waste your money. Get a real stone sharpening set instead."
3,Better than nothing.,"No matter what you do, it will not put an edge on any knife like it was professionally sharpened. However, it will bring an old dull knife back from the dead and get it to the point where you can cut a ripe tomato w/ it, which should be good enough for most purposes. I use my Accusharp on my less expensive knives and stick w/ my honing steel and the occasional trip to the sharpeners for my nicer ones."
