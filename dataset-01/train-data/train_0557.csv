5,I've been waiting forever!,"Like many others who have written here, I was captured by this series when it first aired. I check Amazon periodically to see whether or not it is available and this is the first time I've seen an opportunity to sign up for DVD release notification, which seems to indicate someone may be listening. I have passed along most of my VHS tapes but cannot bear to let this one go until I can replace it. HURRY PEOPLE."
2,a town like alice vhs,The movie I loved but the VHS I recieved was in black and white which was not adertised that was very disapointing
1,Not good!,Both the audio and picture were damaged! You would think they would know a product before they sell it. Makes me wonder how many more are damaged!
1,A lot of buzzing on the soundtrack,"Anyone else have this problem? The tape was sold as new, yet it has a loud buzz on the soundtrack and the video is also noisy, especially at the bottom. We're talking a new tape here, so it is inherent in the production, maybe?"
5,Is there hope?,"Like the others here I love this film, and have done ever since I first saw it years (decades now) ago in Britain. My VHS copy has long since died and we no longer own a VCR so I'm dying for it to come out on DVD."
5,A Town Like Alice with Helen Morse & Bryan Brown,"When will this be available as a DVD? My VHS tape is not good quality. It is an outstanding movie - should be seen by new generation of viewers! I am ready to buy several DVD's for myself and to give as gifts! With all the ""trash"" out there, this is a wonderful, heart wrenching, educational, historical romance set amidst horrific c ircumstances! Please make this version in a DVD soon! The five hour length goes by way too soon! Please make a DVD!"
5,One of my favorite movies,"Oh! how I wish this was on DVD. I love this movie, and have watched it countless times. Some day my VHS tape will break and it won't be available anymore. Please put it on DVD!"
2,Unfortunate.,"I am a huge fan of the label, Someday Baby. I own ""A Child's Gift of Lullabyes"" and ""Rock-A-Bye Collection, Volume 1"". I even bought one of their cassettes under the Target ""Lullabye Club"" packaging. I think that all three of the above publications are absolutely wonderful. And I was thrilled at the thought of having equally beautiful music that expressed a father's love. However, this CD arrived today and I disliked it immediately. At first I thought, ""Oh gosh, it sounds kind of like country"". But then I thought, ""That's not it......I like a little country now and then. This is just BAD!""Perhaps my daughter will like it. That is, after all, the real goal. But I am incredibly disappointed. This music will not keep me humming like the other CDs. Sorry, Someday Baby, I think that you really missed the bar that you set with your other work."
3,not worth buying,"Only about 45 minutes long for the main video. Displays clips of their run, but includes WAY TOO MANY interviews with the players. Additionally, the quality of the video is very poor for 2011. It didn't fit my screen, so there were black bars around it - I'm sure I could have stretched it to fit with my tv settings, but I shouldn't have had to. Most games were shot in high def, so the quality of the picture should have been better too. Additionally, unlike the 2004 championship DVD ""Connquest,"" this DVD does not have either of the final four games to watch in its entirety."
5,Good solid weight tree - glad I purchased it,"This is a good solid weight tree. It has an great center of balance and is as compact as you can make it while still storing all your weights (45, 35, 25, 10, 5, 2.5).Good value. Easy to assemble.Very happy with this product."
3,It is just too small,"This rack is pretty well made although I had to interpret the picture to build since there are no step by step instruction. Build is easy though - 5 miuntes. Like some other reviewers I broke some of the plastic bungs that plug the ends of the round sections. Some went in easily, some were actually loose and some hard to be forced and would not go in w/o breaking. The overall product is pretty solid, but it is just too small. Once you have 35 or 45 lb plate on one peg, there is too little clearance to put anything but perhaps a 5 or 10 lbs on the same side. I am using this as an overflow for 35 and 45's I have spare, but if you want to store a full selection of weight, go elsewhere. The other potential concern is that the 'feet' are only as wide as the pegs holding the weights, so stability is not assured when moving larger plates with any imbalnce from one side"
5,Amazed,"Very sturdy. I am impressed. It seems the weights need to be evenly placed on the tree but it doesn't wobble or shake. Free shipping was the best part. It's so much better than having my weights on the floor.This is for the 2"" diameter hole Olympic weights. The bigger, metric weights."
5,What you see is what you get,"There's not much to say about this other than it's a solid, sturdy weight tree. I saw the same thing in several fitness stores for far more than the Amazon list price. Assembly was a snap, and I stood on the cross supports myself (and I'm a fairly big guy) to test them, and there were no problems. I've got 210lbs worth of weight plates on it now and it still feels rock solid. I'll be adding some 45s on it soon, and I don't expect it will be a problem. It fits nicely in the corner and the plates go on and off without any problems."
5,Well built and funtional,I got this on sale. It's well built and can hold all the plates I load up on it.
3,What bookworm said...,"Up until Janina being taken by the Nazis, this book was a page turner, albeit with a few undeveloped themes (a 9 year old might have had a stronger reaction to being discriminated against, ""Misha"" might have tried harder to remember his real past rather than clinging to the one Uri fabricated, etc).I agree that the last few chapters of the book were rushed and didn't seem to flow with the rest of the story. Misha becomes a very flat character. His slip into semi-insanity is poorly developed, and the way his mental health issues are resolved instantly after meeting his daughter is unrealistic. Milkweed would be a fantastic opportunity to introduce the concept of PTSD to children a little better, but misses the mark.Had Spinelli written a different ending, this book would have had 4 or 5 stars."
4,Read!,"This is an excellent book from a different point of view of Nazi Germany. A young Gypsy orphan boy in Germany, with no known background or family, tries only to survive in the streets of the ghetto in Nazi Germany. The boy first thinks his name is Stopthief, because that's what people call after him when he steals, and later is given the name Misha by a friend. He travels to the ghetto with the Jews, always innocent of what is happening, and steals to survive. Sometimes, he gives the food he steals away to other orphans and one family in particular. This is a heartbreaking story as the reader watches Misha, so innocent, live through all the horrors of Jews in Nazi Germany. Probably readers ages 12 and up would enjoy this book.See More Reviews: [...]"
5,Best book ever!,"It was the time of the Jackboots and the Jews; Misha wakes up in his stall one day when tons of Jackboots pour in and take all the boys to the ghetto where the rest of the Jews are. Milkweed, written by Jerry Spinelli, is realistic fiction book based on the holocaust; it has 208 pages. If you love books about the holocaust with lots of suspense, Milkweed is the book for you. Misha is a short skinny Gypsy boy who lives on the streets. He steals food and eventually gets caught and sent to the ghetto. In the ghetto he finds a small hole in the wall through which he can fit; every night he sneaks out of the ghetto to steal food but always comes back before anyone notices he is gone. The book is worth reading because it depicts some of the reality that the Jews and Gypsy's faced while living in the ghetto during WWII. This book leaves the reader hanging with lots of suspenseful moments. I would give Milkweed a rating of 9 out of 10."
4,Milkweed,"The book Milkweed, is the realistic story of a young jewish boy who goes through the harrowing times of World War II. Misha(as his friends call him) goes from being called Stop Theif! after stealing a loaf of bread, to Filthy Son of Abraham. The poor boy doesnt even know if he is a jew or a gypsy, but either way the nazis hate him. Misha is a slow learner, he thinks that the Nazis(or jackboots as the children call them) are men with magnificent boots marching in a parade. He wants to be a jackboot! Uri(misha's friend) scolds him for saying that. after moving to the ghetto with a friend Janina, they go from night to night stealing food, taking the risk of being caught and getting hanged. If you enjoy World War II books, this book is for you because it really shows what the people had to go through in troublesom times like that."
4,Dylan' Review,"Milkweed is a good book for people that like history and survival. It has enough action to keep you interested in it, and makes you feel this is happening to you. I really liked that it wasn't in the war, but it tells what happening to the other people. I really recommend this book to people who are into these kinds of stories that make you feel all the good and bad stuff is happening to you."
2,telling it like it is,"I am a fan of Jerry Spinelli, but not of Milkweed. The book's sensitive subject matter of the holocaust does not make it exempt from criticism. The book seemed to be overly stylized, verging on pretentious. The ending of the book seemed downright lazy to me, and stuck out like a sore from the rest of the plot. To me, Spinelli's strength is his humor. While Milkweed is not entirely without humor, its excessive self-consciousness overshadows its merits."
2,Not Very Good,"I had to read this for a state-wide essay contest and I hated it. I read it four times in order to fully understand it, and each time I read it, it got more and more painful."
4,Terrific But ...,"Outstanding literature. HOWEVER, may be too intense for children below 8th grade level. The local school tried teaching it in 6th grade and ended up needing Counselors for some of the children. Excellent book, but watch your audience."
4,Milkweed,Milkweed is an excellent story from a child's point of view during WWII and the German occupation of Poland. I would use the story as part of a co-curricular theme in Literature and History.
2,Milkweed,"Milkweed is a book by Jerry Spinelli. You might not know Jerry Spinelli, but he is a realy good author. Milkweed is a book about the time when the Nazis are taking over. It is about a kid who lost his parents by the age of 3. The kid finds an older kid named Uri. Uri has no parents either. The kid lives with Uri under a barber shop. The kid finds out he is a gypsy instead of a Jew. The kid says he wants to be a Nazi when he grows up. BAD! Uri tries to tell him that he should not want to be a Nazi. The kid becomes a pro stealer. He can steal realy well. I know I am probably aggravating you with this kid stuff. Because I am not going to tell you his name. So read the book to find out."
3,Will leave you wanting more....,"""Milkweed"" by Jerry Spinelli, is a truly amazing book.The story is sometimes hard to follow though, becuase of the spastic thoughts, everchanging thoughts of supposed, eight-year-old, Stoptheif or Misha Pilsudski.The ending sounded rushed, and I could barely grasp some of the context. So it receives a 3 out of 5 stars."
3,Milkweed,"The novel Milkweed by Jerry Spinelli takes place in a small city called Warshaw during WWII. This book is about a young homeless boy at first goes by the name Stopthief, then later goes by the name Misha Pilsudski because his friend said that that's his real name, which its not his not his real name, he also thinks that he's a Gypsy, a regular citizen of Warshaw, and he does not liked to be called a Jew, even though he is one. This novel is very deep and it does deal with a lot of issues that I imagine that a lot of homeless Jewish children had to deal with. The author also really shows exactly how much the main character really knows about life and that he doesn't understand too much about it, so he either asks questions or deals with the situation in what way he thinks is right. Overall this book is very well writ and really has details in it from how bad just one street would look like all the way to how the snow looks."
5,Hard political lessons will open a boy's eyes to the reality,"Jerry Spineli's Milkweed tells of a boy who lives in the streets of Warsaw, and who dreams of being a Nazi someday with all the heroism he perceives to go with it. Hard political lessons will open his eyes to the reality behind Nazi sentiments in this hard-hitting and realistic story of a Jewish boy who wants to be otherwise."
5,5 stars no way!! maybe 100!!,"WEll i loved this book. In a way i cried. Im 11 years old. I love this book. And i want to tell people a few things... Misha gets shot in the ear at night. Ok, one problem, they see you and shoot you in the ear, they'll find you and shoot you 100 times spit on you, shoot you more . It was horrible. Buy this book definetly. *********************************************************************************************************** stars"
5,Beware,"This is truly one of the best books I have read. However, Beware! It is not for the faint-hearted. I felt my heart strings being tugged throughout the book, and was appalled by the atrocities that a human was made to suffer. Written in a deceptively simple manner, this book outlined events of a time period that should never have happened. Hats off, Mr.Spinelli!"
4,More fine work from Jerry Spinelli,"Jerry Spinelli has created a unique protagonist for ""Milkweed."" Odd, impressionable little Misha manages to survive in the time of the ""jackboots,"" living by what wits he has. This book transcends war cliches to deliver a gripping, grimy portrait. The ending is favorable, without being ""happy"" or neat. ""Milkweed"" is definitely a keeper. Look past the dreadful cover art and you'll find a beautifully wrought story of the horrors of war and the perseverance of a simple boy."
4,cult but not there best!!!,"this is a great album frum one of Raps most raw, brash, vyl, geto an ganksta groups that ever was! however it is not as good as ""They Scared Of A Nigga"" kuz theres 2 much radio friendly sh$t an th boyz were real ""youngstuz"" hu needed 2 let there ballz drop a bit more (which happened on ""TSOAN"")! still, classic trax lyk ""armed an danjeruz"" ""iym jzt a yungsta"" along with some other supprises if yu do not own th ultra ultra rare ""Dont F#%k Wit Texuz"" EP they put out in 90! well worth it!!!"
2,Very general,"First, there is no listing of model numbers, and therefore no exact way to tell what year outboard you have. All the subsequent tuneup specs are therefore useless, unless the unit can be identified.In the section on remote controls, there is no mention of the name or function of the neutral lock button. In general, there is very little operating information, but lots and lots of tear-apart instructions, something a new outboard owner would never attempt.A professional would want, I imagine, more detail. A recreational boater would want much more how-to-operate info.Not a great manual...the first pages are boringly general...do I really need info on checking a fiberglass hull in an outboard motor book? And how about a reminder to install the transom drain plug! Please."
5,"A Compassionate, Practical Look at Alzheimer's Caregiving","This book is like an arm around the shoulders for caregivers, a tremendous encouragement.Alzheimer's caregiving, and especially end-of-life caregiving, can feel like the loneliest, most bewildering place on Earth. This book provides words of advice, support, and affirmation from others who are feeling and experiencing the same things you are.Thank you, Ms. Braff and Ms. Olenik, for writing, so sensitively, about this difficult topic. I imagine this book will be a great comfort to those who find themselves in the role of caregiver for a loved one with Alzheimer's."
5,Caregiver Resource,THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE CARING FOR FAMILY MEMBER OR IN THE PROFESSIONAL WORLD
1,It stunk,"On first glance, this 4 1/2 hour series is about Civil War battlefields. When you watch it though, you discover that the company recycles the same blurred out ""artsy"" video clips in every single video and throws in choppy simulations of silent films that, upon first glance, appear to be scenes from ""Birth of a Nation."" They aren't. It is just as well that it's blurred because it covers up some of the defects of this low scale fiasco. The company is based in Eugene, Oregon, and it seems doubtful that they ever left that state even to take reenactment footage. A blurred out clip of Burnsides Bridge was used for both Manassas, Sharpsburg and Fredericksburg. I was expecting an in depth discussion of each battlefield with full colored realistic reenactment footage. If you are looking for quality and scholarship, you won't find it in this one."
1,Buyer Beware!,"A 4-DVD set for $9.98. Sounds like a bargain you say? NOT! This series has been released in single DVD form previously, and I can tell you THEY ARE BAD! There are some quality documentaries/films about the Civil War but these are NOT it. You have been warned!"
3,Good basic beginner book,"Though not a terriblly indepth book, it does does go over some basic dog care & some training tips for German Shephers in particular."
4,A good book for New owners,"This book has alot of pictures, it's not all that professional, but it will inform you if your a new owner to the breed. More of a family book!"
2,Tony,"There were a couple of features that attracted me to this unit like the built in dust-collection and the circle sanding. However, so far I am disappointed with the unit. It has severe run out on the disc(3/64in.) on the outside edge. Powermatic sent me a new disc and it is almost as bad. Still waiting to hear from them. I purchased this unit because it was a Powermatic and expected the quality to be set to a higher standard."
4,A window into Irish lore,I owned this book and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to share it with my family at Christmas. It is amusing and delightful to read for short periods of time. It also gave me an insight to my heritage and the Irish giftfor writing.Amazon did an amazing job getting the five books to their destination in New Jersy in a timely manner. Thanks.E
3,"Not particularly good, but","The music itself doesn't impress me much, but it's still good to see a return to older rock in a parodyish form. It's something removed from the usual in today's bland music scene. With the interest this seems to have invoked, perhaps some better music will be able to make its way into the popular sphere of interest once more."
5,Hot Business!!!!!,"This album is awwwwwwwesome! It is unlike anything I've ever heard. I'm glad to see that there are bands out there that still rock the way these guys do. I have been a big fan of such bands as AC/DC, Queen, Van Halen, Led Zepplin, The Ramones, etc. I'm glad to finally hear some new bands that maintain the same great sound as these legendary bands from the 70s & 80s. I hope that this means a new trend in bands that revert back to the rockin' good days that have long past. So, to sum things up go buy this album ..."
5,AWESOME!,"I seriously thought that rock was dead, but after hearing this band I know that it is still very much alive. The Darkness are bringing back REAL rock to people. I'm so tired of stupid talentless corporate sellouts like Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park ruling the airwaves. Dan Hawkins, thank you sooo much for bringing back the guitar solo. Great stuff!!!"
3,There's nothing dark about The Darkness,"The Darkness seem to be jumping on this trend of 70's inspired rock, eg, Kings Of Leon, The Music, The Libertines, and to a certain extend BRMC. It's funny how people throw around descriptions like garage rock, when it's basically an updated term for 'classic rock with riffs'. There's a bit of The Rolling Stones and AC/DC in The Darkness' sound. But they actually remind me more of 70's stadium rockers Foreigner, especially the vocals. This kind of music was never meant to be critiqued by hack journalists, but to have the volume cranked-up in your car. Trying to analyze this is like dissecting Thin Lizzy, Led Zeppelin, or Aerosmith...this stuff was designed to be blasted by speakers in your basement. It's just rock and roll. Nothing more nothing less."
3,Not for classic rockers or headbangers.,"I had to give this album three stars purely for its quality in music; otherwise it's not worth the price of the disc printed upon. The writing and singing are embarassing to hard rock. Yeah, I know, don't take it so seriously, right? It's rock and roll! The falsetto range vocals are a joke, and even though the singer does have a decent ""regular range"" voice, it needs polish, as he sings as though he were verbally speaking the lerics. I don't know, I hate to give such a harsh review to something so popular, but it is just that; popular. Flash without substance. There are so many better new bands out there; check out Burning Brides, among others. This does not belong in the US, it's pub crawl UK music. Maybe the next effort will take into account that great music cannot stand alone, and needs SOMETHING in the form of reasonable writing and singing."
1,Sadly Mistaken,"I originally heard about this band from my brother. Being a big metal fan from back in the 1980's, I've been waiting for a new wave of Heavy Metal to come back. Unfortunately, this is not it.I bought this album without hearing it first (my mistake). I was expecting a Queen/AC-DC, ala Poison/Fasterpussycat sound.I didn't get what I was expecting. Though, the first chords of the first song rock, once the singer comes in, it's down hill. This dude's voice has potential, but he needs to know what his range is. His voice isn't meant to go as high as he tries to go. This band has potential, but their first effort isn't worth buying. Maybe if the got a decent vocalist, they could be the forefathers of the return of hair metal.In short, don't waste your money..."
1,we're not gonna take it anymore...,what the hell?!?!? it makes Poison sound like The Beatles... Buy Twisted Sister instead.
1,Pathetic,"This album, THIS BAND, is pathetic. They may have talent musically, but the vocals in this band make me sick. Whoever inspired this man to become a singer for a band, is an idiot. This band is pathetic and shouldn't be sold in stores. They should have stayed in England."
1,novelty cracker at a christmas party,"right the darkness once said don't take what we do seriously ok justin hawkin we won't..and i never have.yeah i bought the cd as it was the in thing to do at the time to walk around in a cat suit pouting like a fish..then i threw out the nut cracking suit and went to some real music hendrix cream, QOTSA, george harrison s**** like that good s****but really what are the darkness under the spots and mops what's really there OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE I JUST DIScovered what is it? i hear a voice cry it's justn hawkins face god..he's only ugly man only a mother could love...avoid this dreadful cover tribute party act trying to revive 80's metal...but failing miserbly...the darkness are as bad as oasis trying to be the beatles and liam trying to look and sound like john lennon well sorry i ain't gonna happenthe darkness the joke is over,it's like a novelty cracker at a christmas party it's then it's make a big impact then once the smoke settles it's gone forever..."
1,He should join King diamond,The lead singer of this band sound just like king diamond. He should paint himself as uglier version of gene simmons start sing about satan
1,RUN TO THE HILLS!!!!!,"Did I fall asleep and wake up in the 80's again??!!I can't believe the popularity of this band. This is totally 80's metal in the year 2004. The songs are embarrasing and the singers voice makes me crack up laughing. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be a joke (ala Spinal Tap) or these guys think they are actually making good music. To compare them to 70's rock music is inane. These guys sound like Saxon meets Poison meets Whitesnake. The heavy metal stars of the 80's have been long buried, let them rest in peace.If you want this kind of music, pick up something that actually came out in that era (1984-1990). It won't be pleasent to the ears, but it's still better than this.Sorry, but I still can't stop laughing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Ugh..................,"I prefer to choose my own comedy, not have it force fed to me by the hipsters..."
1,Unnecessary.,"1984 is over. Music has evolved. Unfortunately, Justin Hawkins and his troupe of musically-challenged gnomes are still stuck on the big hair and tight pants. No man with a body like that should be wearing so little. NO MAN. But on to the music. Zero originality. This album is nothing but the sick, twisted, inbred lovechild of AC/DC and Queen. If you're a fan of whatever the fudge you'd like to call this kind of ""music"" get an 80's glam rock CD. See if you can tell the difference between that and the claptrap that is ""Permission to Land"". God save us all."
5,Boston = The Darkness,i think what everyone forgot to point out is the unmistakable fact that The Darkness has almost exclusively taken elements (both musical and visual) of their greatest forefather....BOSTON....the spaceships...the songs....the clothing.....the guitarwork....come on nowlove them
1,don't go away mad - just go away,"This record is bad, bad, bad. And the band is horrible. They imitate Spinal Tap and do a poor job at that.Whoever thinks that they are going to revive rock music is full of illusions. These dudes will put the last nail into the casket of rock. Please, go away!"
2,"Musically Sound, But The Singer Is PATHETIC!!!","As I said in the title the music is good, they've definately fed on 70s style fuzz rock, and the Darkness do indeed write solid tunes...musically, but that is as far of a recommendation as I could give this album. What absolutely ruins this record is the singers voice, simply put: If you want to hear what Tiny Tim would have sounded like if he'd done an album with Aerosmith as his backing band, than this is what you've been looking for. If the thought of that disturbs and frightens you, skip this entirely... You'll be seeing this on Amazon soon in the, ""92 used starting at $2.50"" section as soon as the unwaranted hype dies down..."
2,Please Land Somewhere Else,"Now before I get into the review, let me just say that the MUSICIANS in this band are actually pretty damn good. I have to admit, they have talent. They could go places. So why do I give this album only two stars? Easy:It's that [edit] lead singer.To front a good rock band, you need to have an at least halfway decent voice. But this guy sings higher and more theatrical than a c*strated understudy for Les Miserables. Next to him, Tiny Tim sounds like Phil Anselmo. Oy! It's a fantastic way to give yourself a migraine.Also, to the einstein who said ""people who don't like the darkness are mad because they make fun of everyone else"", umm, have you ever heard of THIS IS SPINAL TAP?? I fail to see how this 'duuuuuude' singing like a flambouyant leprichaun is making fun of anyone but himself.Hopefully, one day, the band will kick the lead singer out and get a new, BETTER one. But until then, avoid."
5,Finally.....a return to rock,"After all the years of rap, boy bands, & American Idol ...a band has dared to actually play the 3 instruments of rock & roll. From the opening song ""Black Shuck"", you know it's gonna be a good trip listening to these guys. While they aren't exactly Led Zeppelin, they are definitely the best rock band performing today. I hope their next album can keep this mini rock-revolution going. Album highlights are: ""Get your Hands off my Woman"", ""Givin Up"", & ""Love on the Rocks With No Ice"". If you listen to this album & aren't singing along in your best falsetto after 30 seconds, .....I pity you."
4,70' style hard rock with a light touch,"There are some conditions for anyone to try and like this CD. First, you have to get used to Justin Hawkins singing which can go from a normal decent rock voice one second to sounding like he's just lopped off his babymaker with a knife the next second. On first listen I didn't think I would get used to it, but I did and now it doesn't bother me. Second, you have to like 70's hard rock bands like Aerosmith, AC/DC, Foghat, KISS, Cheap Trick, etc., because that's the style of music The Darkness play. I grew up on these bands so was thrilled to hear some good melodic guitar riffs and solos. Third, lighten up. These are not songs with messages. They are 3 or 4 minutes of loud guitar, overblown rock n' roll vocals and cheesy lyrics probably written while drunk. The Darkness are not a great band but they wrote some fun songs to listen to that will get your head bobbing and feet tapping."
3,An Acquired Taste,"Yeah, these guys rock. Any yeah, this album is one of the better things to happen to rock in the last few years. But Justin's Hawkins' voice is definitely not for everyone. I found it to be an acquired taste that, no matter how long I listened, I just couldn't fully appreciate. Please listen to the samples here on Amazon before you buy and make sure you can tolerate his ""range"". I made the mistake of just grabbing it at Best Buy after I heard these guys were the next AC/DC or Queen. Not."
1,"missing the point, I guess","Don't believe the hype! This is just recycled 80's hard rock with a terrible singer. Save your money for the real thing. The rhythm section is really good, if you like recycled AC/DC riffs (which I certainly do), but when Justin opens his mouth, well, I think people are laughing at him...not with him. Lose the singer, guys. This is hard rock methadone...certainly not the real thing and not really good enough to get me off."
5,Glam Rock is Back,"To listen to this album is a joy for me. I play in a rock band, but we, also, have deep roots in classic and glam rock. I think people are taking this album as a joke. Im not saying there are deep meanings, but they have the same attitude as all the greats. ""We have guitars, and high voices, let's have some fun"". I dont believe that they are trying to be ironic, its just fun music. This is how they express themselves, the music doesnt have to be deep to be expressive. Musically, this ablum is great. I particularly like the dual guitar sound that is reminiscent of Queen, and its good to hear some killer harmonies and modulations. They are very talented, they hit the sound on the head, and they look like they're having fun doing it."
3,the 80's rocked but its time to move on,"i was in college in the 80's and this stuff was great at the time. i agree that hard radio music is getting boring again but going back 2 decades isn't the answer. if you're still listening to iron maiden, ozzy, motley crue and those guys you'll like this. but if you think you're getting something new think again. even jonathon davis of korn is pushing these guys as inovative. he probably has some financial interest in thier record sales - i hope that's not true but he should know better. bottom line is this is not the break through sound its cracked up to be the way korn's first album was. just the same ole wrapped in a different package."
2,THEY NEEDED A ROCK SINGER,"The singer for this band should have been in opera, and the band should have opened up their eyes and saw that fact for themselves. This band does rock and with a good rock and roll singer they could have been more note worthy, no pun intended. Ok some people dig it, but the opereta voice is too much for me. Maybe thats why they are noted for being a one hit wonder band, and made fun of in spite of it. There are a couple of songs on this one where the singer does stay in the lower register and sounds completely different and they are probably the best of the cd. If you enjoy it good for you , I bought it for 0.92 cents just to check it out and totaly rest on my review of it here. I grimiced thru the vocals just to enjoy the good rock music. But I gave it a fair shot."
1,dont wast your time,this is very bad cd. every thing about the mixing the recording it terrible. this album is not worth the money. people say they are the next AC/DC but AC/DC is way way way way better then these guys.
1,This Trash Deserves NO STARS,"What a piece of junk. The Darkness claims that they're going to save rock. It's big talk with little show; it's big ambition with little talent. If I could get past Justin's ""singing"" voice, would I actually like the cd? No. I wonder if his vocal antics weren't merely an attempt to divert criticism from the rest of the band.They claim that they model themselves after the classic rock acts of the 70s and 80s. I shouldn't point out that 70s rock was, generally speaking, far superior to the hair metal junk that came out in the 80s. 70s rock is classic rock. 80s rock is hair metal. That's an important fact that they should get straight. If they really think that they can save such a diverse genre of music, then they are using arrogance as a wall behind which to hide their obvious lack of talent.It's laughable when ridiculous jokes market themselves as rock icons, rehashing things that have been done before and long since forgotten."
3,Hell ya!!!,"All I can say is take this album and band for what it is/they are. Just some guys creating some great melodies, riffs and songs that no one else on MTV or the like is doing. (F**k pop punk, commercial hip hop, and nu rock such as Puddle of Mudd...they all lack real talent, not that is makes much of a difference in today's joke of a music scene, but some people still care). Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange is producing their next album f**kers, and with his ears behind the boards, these guys can't lose. Look at what he did for Def Leppard (Hysteria, Pyromania). Rock on bitches!!!!"
1,Queen Pisstake? Most definitately!,"I largely agree with Nick. These Darkness dudes should really stop taking the piss. Queen were a fine band in their time and it's sad to see such irreverance shown by this new batch of rockers! ""Permission to Land"" is not grossly bad (by today's standards) but the boys need to invent a style of their own to stop being compared (and found lacking) with their elders and betters! That aside, 8 tracks of Justin vocals back to back is just a bit too much to take in one sitting to be honest. It would've been interesting to intersperse the album with the other guys taking turns at vocals to relieve the monotany. I hope for their own sakes they can be more inventive with their next effort - or the Darkness are doomed! Nice one Nick!"
4,huh?,"Why the hell do i like this band..? I mean...they have a song about genital warts or herpes or some shxt.(growing on me) And we sure as hell cant forget about ""i believe in a thing called love"". I even saw them live! Great band but WTF!"
2,Album as a whole pretty much sucks,"I really only bought this cd because of the big hit ""I believe in a thing called love"". I really loved their silly video for that song. Lighten up people, they are just lampooning cheesey videos of the past. I rushed out and bought the cd not long after the video came out, but I really only like the hit ""I believe in a thing called love"". The rest of the album is pretty poor in my opinion.One thing I haven't heard your reviewers say is anything about the crappy sound quality. It just sounds really distorted in my opinion. If they could try doing a good remastering job on it that would be great. So this gets a two star because of that one song."
5,VANESSA:YOUR DAD IS DEAF,Hey you like Eminem and he swears right?The Darkness are way better than Eminem right?Sounds like you have ugly taste in music and that you're a hypocrite!
2,"Aside from A Thing Called Love, this album is poor","When I first heard A Thing Called Love I got very excited, like a combo of Sweet and Queen, how could you go wrong. Well, they went wrong on every other track on this album. What was gleefully annoying on A Thing Called Love was now just annoying. Buy the single, save yourself the pain of this album."
2,Just doesn't work,"I bought this album last year and at first I didn't think itwas that bad. However, after repeated listens the lead singerjust grinds and your nerves! Some of the songs such as thehit single ""I Believe In A Thing Called Love"" along with othertracks like Love Is Only A Feeling and Growing Up are goodenough to survive the vocals...The problem is the rest of the album is filled with good guitarwork with annoying vocals. I think The Darkness would be betteroff to dumb the lead singer and they might have a shot at gettinga good complete record."
2,Nothing New,"I dunno, I have a lotta friends who think the Darkness is an amazing band, but as a musician myself, I always listen to intruments individually to get a sense of a band's true grasp on the music. While listening to this CD, there were absolutely ZERO signature sounds to the Darkness except for the singer, whose voice was appealing to me only one or two songs. Most of the time, it just made me cringe and get annoyed. Suggestion: Download their hit, I Believe In A Thing Called Love, which I did enjoy, and be done with them."
5,Permission To Land Granted!,"I have been a huge music fan for many years. Listened to it all.Hard Rock, Metal,Progressive Metal, Speed Metal. The catagories are endless. The bottom line is we have disc of great rock n roll music. Queen meets Spinal Tap. What's great with the music is the sense of humor. It's great to have something to loosen up with. Not much positive out there now. I am not going into detail of every song. Listen for yourself! Yes I also was attracted to them by the video. Funny as it can get. Reminded me of the old days. Buy it!"
5,My mid-life crisis has commenced...,"When I first heard this disc, I was reminded of a time when bands like Nirvana did not exist above 90 Mhz on the FM band. Of course, I used to sneer at the bands in that upper zone, with their obligatory, nausea-enducing power ballads. Every once in a while, though, one of their songs would become lodged in my head, because they had the hooks! So, in my mid-30's, I can appreciate The Darkness with their tongue-in-cheek humor and don't have to feel guilty about it. Rock is back, but not through the virtues of the White Stripes. Put The Darkness in your car CD player, crank that volume up to 11, and rock on!!!"
3,Different,"I was sent this CD by my brother, he new I liked rock music and thought I would appreciate this album.At first I thought it was a joke as the music, lyrics and vocals were so DIFFERENT, however, the more I listened the more I enjoyed and the more I enjoyed the more I played to friends and family, spreading the word of New Darkness. Good luck.Helen Flavell"
5,A nice change to rock and roll!!!,This cd is great.. if you like the one hit they play on the radio you will love the cd and wonder why they dont play more! I love the different and wonderful vocals... Luv em and see them winning awards in usa..
5,Feels like 1975 again!,"I was channel surfing and stopped for a minute on Fuse to watch a commercial for a band advertising an album where every song ""sounded like it came off a greatest hits CD"". Intrigued, I popped over to the local record emporium and bought The Darkness, ""Permission To Land"" sight unseen (or heard?). On the first lisen I started laughing uncontrollably at the silly lyrics and falsetto singing. On the second listen, I was rocking out just like the first time I heard Montrose or Van Halen. I have guarded hopes good time party rock might be coming back into style. And with girls wearing low slung bell bottom jeans and tube tops again (instead of that baggy-clothes crap), it looks like a great time to be alive."
2,HIGHLY OVERRATED,"Spinal Tap meets (enter crappy band here)____. A few good songs and a lot of stupid ones that throw out the ""F"" word as if it were poetry. Avoid the LP pressing AT ALL COST. Rhino did a crappy job and at times the audio cuts out."
1,Oh Brother,I absolutely love Queen - this band has nothing in common with them. This is Tiny Tim meets Poison - absolutely pointless.
1,UGGHH!!!!!!!!,"Well said ""Music Fan"" from Scotland!!Horrible is not a word strong enough to describe this ridiculous attemt to revive 80's hair metal, yes, this is HAIR metal, not a band full of talented musicians. I almost fell off my chair laughing at some reviews, stating these guy's are the saviours of Rock!!Please avoid, but if your young and have to learn your lesson the hard way, wait a bit to buy because this cd will be crowding bargain bins throughout record stores, very soon.Is that singer really serious!!!?????????"
1,"The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and seen.","I saw the video or ""I Believe In A Thing Called Love,"" and I laughed my ass off. The singer had Ozzy's suit on from 1978, but he looked like Robert Plant, and sounded like King Diamond. Nice influences (except for Diamond..damn the 80s), but this is horrid. I don't think we need another Led Zeppelin ripoff. Stick with the real thing an get Led Zeppelin's debut album. Or Black Sabbath's Vol. 4."
4,From the light comes - The Darkness,"Overblown, over the top and over here! True metal fans beware, this is probably your worst nightmare, everyone else - buy it, you'll love it. These guys rock but don't take it too seriously: crazy, over-powered vocals and testosterone-driven guitar, but what makes this cool is that they can really play. Refreshingly old, priceless.Cheers Guys."
1,rip off,Touting the Darkness as the future of rock is just a blatant lie. Anyone with any amount of sanity will realise that there is nothing more to them than a handful of ripped off Queen riffs and a singer who acts like an attention seeking prat. One day the backlash will start and the Darkness will no longer be percieved as 'cool'.Then you'll be weeping that you ever bought this sorry mess.
3,Happy music from the past,"Look, if your dead set against rock music that it isn't full of rage, angst or hate, then don't bother. Not all rock music needs to sound alike. The Opeths, Porcupine Trees, and Lacuna Coils of this world certainly deserve to be heard and appreciated (I own several CDs of all three), but come on, this is great stuff. No, it isn't cerebral or intricate. But neither is music like Slipnot or Limp Biscuit or Mastadon. With the tremendous dirth of angry thrash and death-metal inundating music these days, we need more bands like The Darkness. There is room for all kinds of music. Rock-n-roll doesn't have to be so depressing all the time. The Darkness is anything but."
5,I Love this band,I never new the darkness untill my friend had me listen to it. and then after i heard this cd i had to go buy it. and for like 3 years me and her have be come a really and i mean REALLY big Darkness fan. so I HIghly recomend this cd.
4,Back To The Days...,"The Darkness have released a new album, Permission to Land. But while it may look like they are an unheard of band from the 1970s. But in fact, they are a new band from England formed back in 2000. And while Permission to Land may not be the next Back in Black, in definitely gave the world a surprise with its retro attitude.The Darkness has given this culture a kick back to the 70s, with heavy metal tunes and outrageous melodies. They are like an AC-DC clone, but they are also innovative, at least for this day. While this isn't standout material, it is an amazing album with nothing to hide."
2,Not that good.,"1. You can either be a joke band or a serious band.I don't care what the hell it is, but make up your mind.2.Dress cooler (and normal), you'll get more respect from people who like real music!3. ""Black Shuck"" ""Get your hands of my women"" ""Love on the rocks"" ""Growing on me"" are top, the rest is sh*t and is very poppy and mainstream.Overall, I don't give two sh*ts but if they reinvent themselves and become a bit more serious next time, they might be on a winner."
1,f*ck this hippie bullsh*t...,"This rimends me of the time of zepli,hendrix,pink floyd and early 80's...It realy sounds horrible! I can't stand any song by ledzeplin or pink floyd because honestly ? It sounds like garbage and so does the darkness. Gay songs and gay vocals like the ones from the band queen (ugh!) Can it suck any worse ? Then queen ? (...) The 70""s & 80's are gone and stop trying to bring it back dammit!!!The only bands from the 80's worth anything slayer,sepultura,iron maiden.metallica (ride the lightning , & ,master of puppets) the only albums by metallica that was worth any thing but f*ck the rest of their albums tho.Don't waste your money of this stuck in the 70's band and actullie listing to good music. Save your money & don't waste on trash!"
1,IF ZERO STARS WERE POSSIBLE......,"this is the worst piece of dreck i have heard in 20 years....that's right- its a throwback to 80's nonsense. try and imagine what it would sound like if your cat was being hacked to death...that would give you a sense of what the lead vocals sound like... i just read an article in guitar player magazine where dan hawkins (guitarist for the band) said that rock guitar is NOT evolving because there is too much reverence for the past...HELLO- have you not listened to your own recording you fool? DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME...THIS BAND IS GETTING QUITE A BIT OF HYPE NOW, BUT PEOPLE WILL COME TO THEIR SENSES AND THEY WILL DISAPPEAR BEFORE YOU KNOW IT...."
1,"Kill Me, Please","Ugh. Bands like this make money while bands like The Dickies languish in obscurity. All this modern ""music"" is nothing but blatant derivative junk. This album is heinous as it steals from the best and yet manages to rend every note to shreds. If I want to listen to Cheap Trick, AC/DC, Whitesnake, Ozzy, etc., I'll spin THOSE albums. The problem today is that consumers cannot bear to listen to albums repeatedly, so they search for replication of the things they're used to. Therefore, derivation takes over and bands like The Darkness gain fame. Ick. Folks, just purchase the old stuff--the classic stuff--you will never go wrong. Moreover, listen to it until you know the music inside-out, to where you can anticipate each note, each lyrical inflection. Just say no to the junk that clutters the racks and hopefully the music industry will get a clue. We'll still find the bands like Nirvana but in the meantime we can avoid garbage like The Darkness. Phew!"
1,It's over people,"The Darkness are pretty much a one shot deal. Its doubtful that they will enjoy a sophomore success. It didn't take long for people to realize that their novelty wears thin, and is not nearly as much fun as Spinal Tap. Even their bass player realized this, and made a wise decision to ditch this glorified cover band.I really have to laugh at the 5 star reviews from 40-50 something farts who are waxing nostalgic for the 80's and are still pissed at grunge for wiping hair metal off the face of the earth. Sorry guys, you had your day. This band isn't going anywhere. and they are certainly not going to reawaken one of the most godawful genres of music in rock history.If you want a current band that plays real and honest rock n' roll without sounding contrived, then check out Queens of the Stone Age or Clutch. If you want the real deal, check out Zeppelin, Sabbath, Cream, Hendrix, the Stooges and Blue Cheer. Don't give this gimmicky joke of a band anymore money."
1,Overrated,"I respect The Darkness for what they are trying to do, but I think that this kind of music has a negative impact on the music scene. This type of music has been done and it lacks creativity. This CD as a whole is very bland with no real differences from song to song. If you would like to listen to 40 minutes of the same song then I recommend this CD to you, otherwise stay away from this CD and in the beautiful words of the lead singer of 40 Below Summer, ""F*ck The Darkness""."
4,Nice,"the Darkness are just plain cool. they are fun to watch and fun to listen to with their queen/hairmetal style and tongue-in-cheek performances. this cd has their more famous songs on it, but as an overall album, i prefer their ""One Way Ticket"" album."
4,totally awesome,"Marshalls, les paul's all out rock! This stuff is unreal it has the power of the past its just awesome! The solos are totally awesome its not metal its not numetal, get this and jet and you got the best new real rock bands of today! NO its not innovative no its not high tech but it rocks its just good feeling rock and roll. What else do you need?"
1,Terrible.,"For all you reveiwers who are giving this monstrosity 5 out of 5 stars. Thats fine by me. But when you're saying they sound like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen and AC/DC, well, I want to snap your necks. The Darkness *shudder* is terrible. DO NOT COMPARE THEM TO THE CLASSICS. AC/DC, Van Halen, Led Zeppelin and Queen all had a little thing called TALENT. Something The Darkness doesn't have. Now go listen to your Darkness cd because in 2 years tops, it's going to be in the back of your closet, gathering dust. And you will be ashamed you own it. For all of you thinking of buying this cd, Don't. Simple as that."
1,This album is funny. but we'll leave it at that.,"This joke was already made by the man who made This is Spinaltap. And so i recommend it instead of this, because it is funnier. As for actual musical quality, this is just bad. Some bands can have annoyingly high pitched vocalists and still be good, this band is just not one of them."
3,Promising Return for Glam Rock,"It's impossible to compare The Darkness to the great grunge rocks of the early nineties--to do so is an injustice to both the grunge and glam rock genres. As an admirer of both, I appreciate the merits of glam that grunge rejected--swelling melodies, over-the-top vocals and raging guitar solos.This album has some great tracks--my favorites are ""Growing on Me,"" ""Giving Up"" as well as the first single, ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love."" Some of the harsher tracks sort of suck--""Stuck in A Rut"" is an earsore. While Hawkins is no Freddy Mercury, his falsetto captures the decadence of the 80's, but the melodies on a lot of the tracks aren't that compelling and as a result the songs aren't that memorable.If you're a fan of the genre, I'd say go for it. Otherwise, pass."
3,"Silly, but it made me smile","Sounding like the totally demented love child of Freddie Mercury and Geddy Lee, Justin Hawkins leads this band through some of the most outrageously, bizarre metal nonsense to come down the pike. There is no point in actually trying to figure out what's going on here. I think it's a put on, but they may be totally serious for all I know. The lyrics are juvenile, but the music is a solid counterpoint.(This band can play.)It won't change your life but it puts a smile on my face. Who knows what they might come up with next..."
4,The Darkness Rocks!,"The first single off the Darkness's first album was entitled ""A thing called love."" Honestly, the first time I heard it I just gigled to myself through the whole thing. The lead siger's voice reaches amazingly high notes and the song is just so up-beat and fun. This song sparked my interest and I bought the CD. I kind of fell in love with the whole album. The first song on the CD, ""Black Shuck"", is a faced paced hard rock song that just makes you want to sing along with it. There are two heartfelt ballads on the CD as well that are also really great. If you're looking for something to pick you up and maybe cause you to chuckle here and there, than this is a great CD for you. The lead singer is very animated and eccentric, but it makes their music really interesting and fun to listen to. This album grew on me and I'm sure it would grow on anyone else that heard it as well."
5,yehhh,"what can i say man. The darkness is the best thing for the present since sliced bread. Rock and Rock has finally made a come back with these guys, and i commend them for it to shut out all of these pop-rock punk ass bands. ""Love is only a feeling"" is not only the best song on the cd, but one of the greatest power ballads of all-time, believe me people if you know anything about power ballads in the 80's. Mr. Justin Hawkins hits the notes that we all wish that we could hit in our dreams, and he does so very successfully. The band is fantastic and all 10 songs are worth giving a listen to many times over and over again. If you love the old school stuff, this is for you..."
3,Not life changing...but a lot of fun,"First off, let me start off by saying that this band missed the 1980's be about 20 years or so. Now with that said, the first time I heard these guys, I couldn't help but turn it up a bit.The band I can compare these guys to the best is Boston. The high-pitched vocals and harmonizing guitars. If you like Boston, you should have a good time with this album.Good guitar-driven power-pop at a decent price. Give it a shot."
5,"YO DOOMBOY,","you missed the point completely. dude, this band is just riding on a simple power pop metal comeback. like motley crue renaissance of sorts, just more inventive singing technique. wtf, are you always that uptight?"
1,TRAGIC,This album is full of stale tired worn out riffs that have been done to death. The only originality is that Justin occasionally lapses into a shrieking holler that sounds as if he's caught his balls in his zipper. That alone is worth five stars for its hilarity! Being serious here though. This album is a sad reflection of the state that British rock music is in.
3,"Maybe a tad overrated, but a fun album","If Queen and AC/DC had a love child, it may have turned out a lot like The Darkness.If that doesn't appeal, steer clear of this album. If it does, then - like me - you'll probably not regret purchasing this album, get a few enjoyable listens out of it, and then file it away in your music collection, almost (but not quite) forgotten, to be brought out for the periodic listen.One thing I will say for it is this: the songs have made some excellent additions to mixtapes/CDs.Not a waste of money, but by no means a transcenent musical experience."
5,This is one cd that should put a smile on your face,"If AC/DC was fronted by Freddie Mercury and sang songs with lyrics Tenacious D might think of, you'd get The Darkness. This does seem to be a love it or hate it type of deal... obviously I am in love it category. This cd puts a smile on my face every time, especially the first 6 tracks. Yes, the lyrics are ridiculous. Their video is so piss-poor you can't help but love it. This album is no joke though... these people can play, and good lord the vocals... this guy has some pipes. When you wear out your copy of Back in Black or Apetite for Destruction, throw this disc in while you're driving... it'll have the same effect, except you haven't heard it 1000 times. Although chances are, after you buy it, it'll be in your cd player for a long time to come."
3,unadutarated carp...,"There's something fishy going on here...-I grew up in the '70's, surrounded by the music of the Sweet, Mud, Suzy Q, Gary Glitter, T-rex,Slade etc...and it seems as if this band has been downloaded Matrix style with all of that music and have then simply regurgitated it out of any form of ordertotally unoriginal, but fun-lead singer sounds like a rip of the Sweet's recently deceased Brian Connolley."
1,St. Anger's Actually Better Than This CRAP!!!,"Oh boy, I thought ""St. Anger"" (Metallica) was the most unorganized, poorly arranged and produced material ever, ... until I heard the Darkness. This CD is so bad, I pawned it off in 24 hours! Justin Hawkin's nauseating vocals, along with piss-poor musicianship, ... it's actually scary to believe that Avril Lavigne or Nickelback are WAY better than these guys! To think that this made the top 10! And this is comparable to AC/DC and Queen? Gees, this sounds more like a bad Sloan record!Justin Hawkins has my permission to land, ... in volvanoes!"
1,Best Comedy Album of the Year,"You have got to be joking, this album is the funniest thing I've heard in years, I played it a work the other day and we were all almost wetting ourselves from laughing so hard. This band seriously needs a new singer and some original ideas, Almost every song on the album is a rip-off of bands from the 1980's, such as AC-DC, Queen, Motley Crue, Van Halen etc etc.Anyway, if you want to have a really good laugh, then go and buy this CD an after you've played it a few times, put it where it belongs, in........The Darkness, at the bottom of your rubbish bin."
1,Worst CD ever?,"I just listened to the song samples on Amazon and I must say it is some of the worst cr*p I ever heard. First of all, to the reviewer below, NEVER mention AC/DC and this group in the same sentence again...ever. That is blasphemy. Second, the singer sounds like Smurfette after sucking a helium balloon and getting his n*ts caught in a vise. Third, for those of you trying to pass this off as a parody, as in ""It's supposed to be bad, ha ha, don't you get it?"", you're not fooling anyone. Spinal Tap is an obvious parody. This is an obvious pile of horse manure."
1,We live in a land of sheep,"I can't believe people are being suckerd into buying this waste of plastic. I only played the sample bytes but it is clear what I hear. BAD!! 80's glam rock. This style was awfull in the 80's,I don't need to hear it again! And certainly not a bad version. As for those saying I don't get the joke, it's not funny. The first rule of satire or cheesy mockery is some level of intellect and talent. (even some wit wound't hurt) But none is found here. The lyrics are juvenile, the music is flat and the singing is non-existent. If you buy this disc you're the but of the joke, Barnum."
1,Total Crap!!!!!!!,"I just saw ""I Believe In A Thing Called Love This"" on VH1 and i have to say it is, by far the worst song/video that i have ever seen before. The only reason I finished watchhing it was to find out the name of the band. I thought that VH1 must have been playing a flash back from the 80's. How did this crap make it on the air???? DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THE VIDEO, I FEEL DUMMER HAVING DOING SO.just thought I'd warn everyone."
1,...,"OK, maybe i've listened to too many death-metal and prog bands, but let me tell you this:This is crap."
2,"Better than Limp Bizkit, but not better than real metal!","The compare this band to Queen or Mercyful Fate for vocal or musical style is really bogus. I give them two stars and not zero only because they came out different which counts for something. They could have easily just been another meat-head group like Disturbed or System of a Down but chose to try and bring back metal. Keep in mind I said try! They are not the worst I've heard but far from the best, I really hate that cheasy/corny L.A. style of metal! If this is what ""metal"" is coming to then I'll just strictly listen to the classics."
2,Consider This...,"Without The Darkness the music scene would not be in the right place for Velvet Revolver. Now we gotta listen to Velvet Revolver. In protest, I'm going back to my old Queen lps... oh, wait! I don't have any. (Two stars in the hopes that they will eventually cover the FLASH GORDON theme song.)"
2,Ridiculously stupid...,"I loved the songs ""I Beleive In A Thing Called Love"" and ""Growing On Me"", so i decided to buy this album... big mistake. Besides those songs, there was only one other song that I thought was OKAY and that is ""Friday Night"". Other than that, theres some really really crappy songs. ""Get Your Hands Off My Woman"" is possibly the worst song I've ever heard. The vocals are horrible, the music isn't amazing, and the lyrics are completely brainless and pointless. If you thought 80's hair metal was bad, this song will make you long to hear them instead of this..."
3,Refreshing,"The screaming, the guitars, and the sound that's like a blend of three eighty's bands. Ah, it's nice to hear something different. It's not the type of cd i'd listen to often just something to throw a spin on things once and awhile. Besides I Believe In A Thing Called Love the rest of the album isn't very commercial and is experimental. They have their own sound and for that they deserve credit."
2,Weak vocals,"The music is pretty good only because it's reminiscient of classic rock from the '70s. The vocals are okay until he gets into the falsetto parts. The vocals are nowhere near what Queen had. If you think that, you aren't a queen fan. Just for the record: falsetto male vocals are not ""operatic"""
3,The darkness are clearly a joke band.,"It disturbs me slightly that people think they are 'for real'.His voice is silly, and the songs are over the top and cheesy. The songs condradict each other too, just look at the tracklisting; 'I believe in a thing called love' is directly followed by 'love is only a feeling'.I also believe there is an 'extra' track on the album, a viciously slaughtered version of radioheads street spirit. You lucky people."
2,It's too bad!,"Ok, this CD makes me sad. The only song i like is I believe in a thing called love. All the rest make me cringe. I bought this CD for my dad for christmas. At first, he listened to it all the time, but then he realized that mostly all the songs had the F word in it and he's basically stopped listening to the album. We are christians, but we don't always listen to Christian music. Can't they express their feelings without using the F word? It's too bad and a waste of talent. besides the song, 'I believe in a thing called love"", i give the rest of the album a surpirsing F."
1,Permission Denied,"The Darkness are not here to save music.This has to be the most god-awful refuse I've ever heard. I read the magazine reviews and thought it might be fun.It isn't.Far From It.You want tongue-in-cheek music that parodies the 80s metal scene? Try Spinal Tap. You want to relive that scene? Check any number of the fabulous reissues/remasters by many of the best metal bands. You want hard rock with tongue firmly planted in cheek? Try Type O Negative. If you're looking for the next Freddie Mercury, he's not here.Why should you not buy this album? It's been done before. Better. Much better. Just because they are the only new band attempting this style now doesn't mean they're good. It doesn't mean it's inspired. It's a gimmick. The horrible soundtrack to the movie Rock Star was better than this garbage. I'm baffled as to why anyone could find this listenable."
1,Fire the guy who signed these tools!!,"Can you say, ""sing in key?"" who the hell likes this crap? It's really bad 80's metal. The songs might not be so bad if the guy could sing. If you want to sound like King Diamond, take some notes, he sings in key!!"
2,I dont think so,"kerrang states this is the best rock in the last 20 years.WRONG the 3best rock albums PAYIN THE DUES,,,,HELLACOPTERS FLAMING SIDEBURNS SAVE ROCK N ROLL BLEACH ,, NIRVANA that being said darkness sound like AC DC meet king diamond.if u want u can have my cd of THE DARKNESS i thought it sucked .if you do by chance like this .Try SWEET great vocal band that should have been up alongside QUEEN that`s whole another review. IF U HAVE ANY KIND OF SOUL FOR TRUE ROCK GOTTA CHECK OUT COPTERS AND THE SIDEBURNS DO IT NOW!!!!!!!"
1,Like bamboo shards under your toenails...,"The sound of this guys voice and his blatant homosexuality make this one of the worst bands in the history of music. Combining a sense of 70's cocaine habits and 80's hair styles yet lacking the skill and talent of congressman of that era. If I could some up this band in a word, I'd be a genius. The fact of the matter is that there is no way to describe, in adequate detail, the infinite horror that The Darkness plays on your body's senses."
1,What's the fuss about?,"God almighty, I thought music had moved on from this Whitesnake induced bile.It's rubbish, total, complete and utter rubbish. If this is your type of thing, go and buy a CD by trash groups like Europe or the aforementioned Whitesnake. The lead singer puts on a jumpsuit and grows his hair long and look, he's a rocker! Not!!Garbage lyrics, when you can make them out among the swearing (God, what a rebel!). Junk, trash, bile. If you're looking for something better from GB then Morrissey, Franz Ferdinand, Radiohead, the list is endless of good quality music and lyrics with a lack of ego.Can we please have a no star rating?"
2,"1 really exceptional song plus 9 other ""filler songs""","I love a wide arrange of music, and im very open to new stuff....i feel like i got gipped out of my money.....i really had high expectations for this band. Especially since everytime i hear something on this band its always positive. Great music but the lead singer can be really annoying alot of time with his wails. I beleive in a thing called love is a great song, and the others just fail in comparison"
1,I want to like this band but...,"I just can't accept The Darkness. All their songs have that really annoying 'I've heard this before' feeling attatched to it. All my friends love this band but the singers whiny, out of key voice cuts through me and when ever it's on the radio I have to turn it off. This is the kind of music which can be described as 'rock music - but not really' and it only encourages pre-teen girls to think that they are real rock chicks when they listen to it. Why not try some great bands like KoRn, Queens Of The Stone Age and Disturbed?"
1,How did these guys ever get produced,"Yet another fad band that will be around for no more than 6 months. All we have to do is wait that long before we can get back to real music that my dog doesn't cover over his ears for. The lead singer's ego is so big he actually thinks he can kill grunge rock with this so-called music, well he has another thing coming. As with natural selection, only the fittest survive, and thank god this group has been selected against."
1,A JOKE?,"I DO NOT recommend this album to anyone at all.i think it's a joke and i think they are trying tooooo hard to sound and act like Queen. i do think they are funny just cause they seem to be trying a little to hard and they seem like a really bad joke. the whole album is ridiculous and their video for ""i believe in a thing called love"" is obnoxious.The Darkness won't be around for much longer and they'll die down (not that they were ever big) pretty soon and no one will ever remember them because they were a JOKE!"
2,Sounds like Tiny Tim Reincarnate,"There is nothing hard or old school about this crap. If tiptoeing through the tulips is heavy to you, you must be walking the trough when you hear Jewel."
1,"Definitely not ""Old-school""","Whoever wrote a review saying that the Darkness is old-school and compared them with AC/DC, Van Halen, and Queen is completely wrong. Dude- just because the lead singer has an obnoxiously high voice does make this a throw-back 80's rock and roll band! I'll admit their idea to bring back 80's rock was creative, but they have NO TALENT. Whoever buys this CD has NO TASTE IN MUSIC!"
4,"Some will get it, most will not.","I do get it though and what I get is NOT a joke. However strange and ill-timed this glam-hair-metal sensation may seem, they do indeed, rock.I will admit it took a few listens to get used to the high octaves and screaming fallsettos in the vocals on Permission To Land, but once I did, the album simply rocked. Overall, The Darkness aren't even my usual cup of tea. I tend to stay away from the metal arena, but The Darkness can not be ignored, believe me. The record has great rock melodies all the way through, I Believe In A Thing Called Love, Growing On Me and Get Your Hands Of My Woman, are all great singles with the catchiest of hooks. The rest of the disc rarely turns south either, in the end, it's mostly killer, hardly any filler."
5,"Permision granted, the darkness has landed","One hell of a band. If you didn't know better, you might mistake these guys for an oldies band from the 70's. These guys are amazing. You get a little bit of punk rock, pop rock, and slam rock from these guys. The Darkness have put together an amazing CD, including the hit song ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love."" This is one band that you either love or you hate. I love them."
3,A real rock CD to rally around?,"If everyone is so right about this being one of the great rock albums of the new decade, then am I wrong?It says a great deal about the music scene when Permission to Land is considered the above. While it is not a bad album, per se, I did not really like it much and believe it is a creature of hype rather than anything of substance. All the real rock bands have either broken up or settled into a classic rock mode where all we get is their old songs on radio or CD's that sound like everything they have ever done before.The Brit press does a good job of hyping up just about anything, but I do not think the rookie effort of The Darkness is really worthy of the hype...but if you are looking for somethign that is slightly better than the trash being scuttled out from the music companies this one will foot the bill, but little more.As an aside a few of the tracks reminded me of the Bee Gee's and if they had made the decision to do a falsetto rock album."
4,darkness rocks my world,this cd is very close to stellar. the entire album is full of good music...which makes the 80s rocker happy.
4,a great classic rock album,Permission to land is one of the best debut albums from this great classic rock band.almost all the tracks are classics and this album is very good and is highly recommended.
2,15 minutes of fame is almost up......,"This is really great a return to the days of 70's and 80's hair metal in the smae vain as Van Halen and Queen. We sure do know how popular those bands are today.....Basically the Darkness is a gimmick band that will be around for about 15 minutes of fame, or untill people realise that they did not like 80's hair metal for a reason....I would be very surprised if the Darkeness was around next year, as I am sure the next gimmick will be ""new wave""...."
2,Rock Band with Fake Vocals,"Music is hot the vocals are not. Falsetto all the way, it's like a joke. Weird Al does better screaming!"
5,I am loving this.,"The first time I had ever heard of this band was when I saw them on TV. The lead singer was wearing a David Lee Roth like outfit and i thought it was a riot. Then I realized that he's a wicked singer and the band became legitimately good. I don't get why people who are devoted music listeners develop a certain closed-minded attitude, as if their some sort of authority on the subject of taste simply because they listen to alot of music. These guys should be huge, but they might not make it huge because people will think they're a big joke superficially. Especially in this day and age, there's no way that any rock n roll fan should not appreciate this band's talent and mission. Plus they have good songs that are fun to listen to. I really want to see these guys live, but I live in Canada so I'm going to have to hope that they make it bigger first."
3,"Maybe it's not brilliant, but it's catchy","Maybe this band is a fake, marketing-made band striving to jump on the ""new wave"" bandwagon. But it's catchy music. A little irritating, but it's fun."
3,Hilarious!,"What's all the angst about?I think these guys are a breath of fresh air.Sure it's contived and silly, but what a blast!Spinal Tap lives on.I suspect these guys are having the last laugh and having a great time too.It's only entertainment after all. Bring it on."
5,Need Money to finish Rocket Ship.,"Well, i bought this albulm off a whim.Stop One night while watching MTV i saw a ""Buzzworthy"" dealio on the darkness. Stop I first blew it off, as a ""well, that was stupid."" stop. I then saw the full version, and after listing to the guitar riff close to the end, i fell in love with them. Stop being, thirteen, my dad freaks out when all they can say is ""Well ____ That."" Stop so, i bought the edited version. Stop They are one of those bands that you need to ""get"". Stop They are supposed to be stupid blatent ripoffs, so get over it and stop whining. Stop The guitar is awsome. stop The only song i skip is ""Love on the rocks with no ice. Stop Buy it. stop That is all."
1,oh no!,"is this a copy of VAN HALEN's David ""diamond"" Lee Roth or Brian Johnson's AC/DC? from the first tune you will know that the man who becomes a singer, is an idiot!My advice:go & listen to the legendary hard rock classic bands such as Deep purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, King Crimson, ELP, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Genesis.....they will not ever be forgotten in the next 50 years, but who will still remember the DARKNESS in the next 3 years??"
2,What's all the fuss about?!,"I kept hearing about how The Darkness are winning awards and plaudits left, right and centre; about how they are this revolutionary sound that is rekindling rock. Pah! Give me a break!They are just glam rock rejurgitated. And poor glam rock at that! To compare them to such legends as Queen and AC/DC is a joke. They are clearly manufactured, hyped-up fluff. Granted, they are talented musicians, but they lack a real cutting edge. Their songs are hollow: peal off the flashy, shrill skin and there's nothing inside!And to all the people who go on about how great the lead singer's voice is... there's more to being a rock singer than just range! High range vocals are fine in the right circumstances, but they need edge and attitude. This guy sounds like a neutered cabaret singer! For reference on how it *should* be done try listening to Deep Purple, AC/DC, Rush, etc.If this is the latest revolution in metal then we're all in deep trouble!"
1,Awful,"Oh this is so old, and this horrible voice. I rather listen to Poison, Skidrow, Mötley Crüe - they were far better than these wannabes."
4,"Predictable music, unexpected turn","I have just bought this cd, and after listening to it in my friends basement while playing video games, i found it suprising. The music itself was not suprising, the riffs and lyrics were generic and predictable. But the fact that this new band has guitar solos and musical talent was suprising and pleasing. many bands now days lack the quality of musicianship that this band has, and the solos were quite good. The predictability was also almost comforting, you could sing along with a song even if you'd never heard it before."
4,"NOT THE FIRST, NOT THE SECOND, BUT GOOD","First off, the Darkness isn't even the first band to revive the 70's rock style. PLEASE do yourselves a favor and check out such bands as The Tight Bros From Way Back When, the Cherry Valence, and Those Peabodys. All great variations on this theme. But anyway, this album is just fun, and it's a throwback, but it is NOT ironic. It's outlandish because this kind of over-the-top, ebullient music has become so foreign to us. And that's why it's so refreshing to listen to it! There was a time when rock wasn't brooding, rock wasn't about being an obnoxious Hot Topic ""punk"", rock was... just invigorating! Celebratory! That's what this album is."
1,Terrible,This band are a joke and the album is terrible.Goodness knows what the other reviewers are buying.They are competent musicians in their own right but as a collective they just can't hack it. The album is full of stale tired old riffs and the vocalist tends to lose the plot on occasions by descending into what I can only describe as a shrieking holler. ...
5,Out of Darkness comes Vocal light,"A friend recommended this album to me, and I must do the same for all of you rock fans out there. Upon first listening one might hear a tint of Freddy Mercury in the lead vocals, but quickly the over-the-top inflections of voice are complimented by the solid rock score. This is quite possibly one of the purest rock albums to hit the shelves in years. If you are looking for creative (and inspired) guitar riffs than this is most definitely the album for you. It has been quite some time since I have heard such clean guitar licks laid down with such precision as only accomplished players can create. Buy this album and you won't be dissapointed, however, you may need to give it a chance because the vocals are full of inflection (i.e. the vocalist shows his full range of vocal movement)."
4,a new take on a old thing,"The darkness can best be described as a the kid of a hairband from 20 years ago, funny to look at and listen too, but with a positive attitude and a serious love for music. Yes they are diferent, buyt thatz what makes them cool. keep rocking guys"
4,Desire,Desire is guaranteed to get the club going! This is definitely going to be one of next big tracks. An absolute hit. I would recomend this CD to any truly devoted fan of the club scene.
5,Static psychological horror.,"This excellent film deviates from Rollin's vampire obsession in favour of a ""parnanoid"" tale of urban horror. There isn't much action, but the plot is unnerving.At times, it seems like Rollin is doing a fine imitation of the early Cronenberg (RABID and SHIVERS come to mind).As with other REDEMPTION DVD's, this lacks any interesting extras. But again, as with all the Rollin films in this series, the print is of the best quality.A quirky film that should not be missed."
3,"interesting ideas, low budget.","this jean rollin film, which was supposedly filmed in two weeks, often mangages to overcome its extremely low budget, although not always. The film is the strange story of a girl, Lahaie, who is found wandering through the woods one day with no memory. Later it is discovered that she has escaped from a mysterious mental hospital where no one retains there memory. There is a lot of imagination and creativity in this film. Supposedly, it is considered to be on of Rollin's worst films. Since this is the only film of his that i've seen, I can't vouche for that. However, I for one didn't think it was bad at all. In fact, I actually found myself liking it. It's too bad that Rollin didn't have more money and time on this one, it would be interesting to see what he could pull off. Considering that the cast is made up of porn stars and amateurs, the acting really isn't that bad. Worth a look if anything."
2,New to Jean Rollin . . .,"As A huge Argento fan I decided to try out other European directors from the ""Euro-Horror"" movie genre. This movie tried to be everything from soft core porno to ""b"" grade horror . I've been told that this is not indicative of his other movies, and I would hope not . I will try other Rollin's movies in the future but will be very cautious in purchasing them . The DVD itself is actually very well done , I just wish they had done a better job on the movie ."
4,Brigitte Lahaie in an unexpectedly compassionate role.,"Most fans know Brigitte Lahaie as the French adult films actress who earned a cult following through her work for director Jean Rollin in erotic horror films like ""Fascination."" But in ""Night of the Hunted"" she gives an unexpectedly compassionate performance in a film with the requisite gore and nudity, but also real emotional impact. For a free catalog of Ms. Lahaie's rare French horror and adult films, send your full mailing address to videoeuropa@hotmail.com"
3,Another Jean Rollin Great,"This movie does not follow the gothic-like vampire theme and there's not much blood, but it's still a Jean Rollin master piece. Not everyone understands Jean Rollin...and not everyone will understand this movie...a must though for Jean Rollin fans."
5,I can't believe it's all over!,"No more Ross and worse, no more Demelza. No more feud with the Warleggans. Although Graham easily has material for a whole new generation of Poldarks, apparently this is the last one. Fortunately, there's a ton of Poldark books to go back and start reading again. I can't wait.There's such a true sense of place in this series; Cornwall in the 17th/18th century is alive and so appealing. The characters are appealing, even as they appall, like Ross's enemy George Warleggan.The PBS series was grand too, but the books are better. Such a diverting relief from too much war TV.If you like the very different novels of Daphne du Maurier or, even more distinctly, the veterinary tales of James Herriot in Yorkshire, you'll find something to like here."
5,Stunning look at the most overlooked yet most popular forest,"Proximity to Los Angeles makes the Angeles National Forest an extremely popular place to visit. In some ways, people think of this forest as a local place without the splendor of Yosemite or the fascination of Death Valley. But this book shows that the Angeles National Forest has charms all its own--here are glorious chapparal in bloom, spring waterfalls in a dry land, century plant spikes blooming brightly against stark mountain landscapes, and fall leaves in hidden canyon passes. If you love this forest, you will love this book; but perhaps the most important thing is that even if you don't know this forest, you will love this book. This is the ideal addition to the bookshelf, the coffee table, or that hidden space where one goes to read serene books about dynamic natural places....I highly recommend."
1,Sci Fi Chiller without the Sci Fi,"""Fugitive Mind"" was produced for Canadian TV and recently released in the US as a feature-length movie. A company named GENCOM has reprogrammed the mind of one of its employees (Michael Dudikoff) to kill a political figure. With the help of his girlfriend (Heather Langenkamp), Robert must fight to regain his lost personality and stop GENCOM before it is too late.This movie is bad... poor scripting, bad acting and virutally no science fiction aspects, despite this being a sci-fi movie. I only bought it because I am a Heather Langenkamp fan (she was in the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""), but all others should stay away.Also stars Michele Green (""The Unborn II"") and Gil Gerard."
3,Average Thriller,"Fugitive Mind is about a man, who was part of mind controlling experiments. One day he awakes to find the life as he knows it were nothing more than memories inplanted to him. Nice plot for a TV movie. Dudikoff shows again he can act."
3,He's worth a look,"If you like Damien Rice, you will probably like Rob Deeble. This isn't his best work--find Earthside Down on the paste.com site, and enjoy his soulful voice, beautiful guitar and cello, and interesting lyrics."
3,Very Intimate and Low Key,"I happen to see Robert Deeble in concert not long ago, and he brought all new songs. He explained he hadn't done anything for quite a while etc. The new songs were quite nice, and I decided to check out some more of his music. Indeed, Deeble has not produce much the last 10 years: 2 albums, including this one, which technically is not even a ""Robert Deeble"" record. The group is ""Days Like These"", a trio with Deeble being the main creative force behind it.The self-titled ""Days Like These"" is a collection of songs from 1992-1994, which found their way on this 1997 album. Most of the songs are very intimate, and low key. The opening track ""The Kiss"" is a good example of that. On ""Half Time Slow"" Deeble brings some nice accoustic guitar work. ""The Bridge"" is one of several strings-heavy songs.Overall, this is an okay album, but at times I was ready for the songs to become a little more ""heavy"", which they didn't. This is a very relaxed, intimate, at times somber album."
3,Bought it to attach a throttle to an electric scooter,"This item is fine. It didn't serve the original purpose that I had purchased it for, though I have used it on other projects since."
5,Chrome Tip,Put'em on my glass packs and the 2 1/4 fit INSIDE the out end. No need for a sleeve. Perfect!
5,Enthusiastic,"Enthusiastic, well written, and informative. As a gardener I have found this book very helpful and easy to read."
5,"If you like punk rock, then this is the band to check out","I suppose you could say that with the punk rock bands that are out today, you would not consider Naked Raygun punk rock or anything like that. Be that as it may, Naked Raygun stand among as one as the greatest bands to ever form. Definately, if you want something new and interesting to listen to, then pick up Naked Raygun CD."
5,Classic Album,"This has to be N.R. best, hands down. There is only one clucker in the bunch, ""Mr Gridlock"", and that is only half bad. Each is great to sing along with and to blow out your speakers and yr eardrums too. Why are you waiting, buy it. You know you want too."
2,Shocked,"Really surprised to see so many positives regarding this one. NOWHERE near as good as Throb Throb or Basement Screams, more like a water treading move, but punks seem to want more of the same and that's what they get, so what are you gonna do? A couple of good songs true, but where time has made Throb throb sound better (and I got that lp when it came out), time has not been kind to All Rise which sounds like it was sort of rushed and more polished - were they trying to ""make it"" as a band? Money's good and all, but not when it waters down the actual music."
4,LACE TOP STOCKINGS,These are GREAT QUALITY STOCKINGS! THEY FIT PERFECTLY!I LOVE THEM...THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE.THANKS A BUNCH
1,Keep it!,"Ugh. Another book about another corporate demon who has forced millions of people into the bankruptcy courts so he can take his millions and run? When are we going to get a book about the nice small businesses that run every day, without celebration -- hiring good people and treating their customers like family? There are thousands of those stories out there, but for some reason we never seem to get books about them. Maybe Sandy Weill can marry Martha Stewart. Sam Waksal can officiate and Michael Jackson can give away the bride. I say Enough Already!"
4,Packed With Knowledge!,"Monica Langley follows Sandford Weill, a shy Jewish boy from Brooklyn, through his youthful struggles against adversity, his journey to the absolute top of the financial world and his tainted success. Seen through the prism of Weill's tumultuous career, the financial world is small, despite its importance, internally more like a village than a city. The book just confirms your suspicions that practical finance bears almost no resemblance to what you learned in economics class. We recommended Langley for skillfully molding the saga of this titanic financier's career into such a compelling, well-constructed narrative."
5,Spell Binder,"Monica Langley's 'Tearing Down the Walls' is one the best books about Wall Street bankers. Sandy Weil's life and his rise epitomizes the life on Wall Street before the crisis. Ms.Langley's racy style keeps the reader completely engrossed. Provides great insight into the minds and egos of Wall Street CEOs. After reading the book, one has a better understanding why Wall Street firms are confronting the worst crisis on a scale never seen before. The relentless push by Sandy Weil to repeal the Glass Steagall Act, so as to make Citi Group as a financial powerhouse is one of the underlying causes for the crisis on Wall Street. It shows how driven Wall Street CEOs are to achieve goals that matter to them and their firms, unmindful of larger consequences. The grooming of Jamie Dimon as Sandy's protege at Citi and Dimon's sudden departure from Citi makes for fascinating reading."
5,Possibly my all-time favorite book!,"A glorious story of adventure when Kent and two friends sailed on a private schooner from Labrador and Newfoundland to Greenland. We are carried along through deep fogs, icebergs, storms and calms until the men are shipwrecked in a violent storm on Greenland's rocky shore. The story also presents an absorbing and tender tale of the relationships of Kent with the people of Newfoundland, his two shipmates and the Stone Age Eskimos of Greenland -- who threw him a highly successful party in spite of the language barrier. Kent illustrated the text with over 100 magnificent sketches and woodblock drawings that in themselves are worth the price."
4,Dust collector,This dust collector appears to be a very useful part of my home work shop.It is quite noisy but sucks well. The installation of the bottom plastic collection bag is quite a struggle.Jet should look at a redesign to simplify that part. Otherwise the collector is very good
5,A suggestion for using the Jet dust collector,"I've owned two of these collectors (had to sell one before a cross-country move) and both were exceptional at collecting very fine dust from my drum sander and other machines. I work in a garage and have tried several ways of running hoses but they always ended up in the way or I needed to move machines to accommodate large work pieces. It finally occurred to me that I really only needed to hook up one machine at a time. Enter Rockler Woodworking: They have a 21' (very) flexible, expandable hose and machine fittings that connect quickly without tools. These products are a bit pricey but cheaper than running multiple hoses and gates. You can also use the hose with Rockler's handpiece and bench/floor brush as a huge shop vacuum."
1,Damaged and Slow Delivery,"I just got mine delivered after waiting 3 1/2 weeks. The box was undamaged but the impeller housing is crushed. I'm very disappointed in the shipping and will have amazon send another, which will take another 3-4 weeks:(Just got the second one 11/16/06. Every thing looks good. It only took about an hour to assemble. Run great, only a small leak where it is spot welded. I will fix it with caulking. I noticed that it was shipped directly from the factory."
4,Good product,My only complaint is the assembly instructions just fell apart. Everything was fine and accurate until it started talking about assembling imaginary parts that don't exist for this model. It's as if they just used their assembly instructions from some other model dust collector.
1,Poor (off-shored) customer service,"My problem is not with the dust collector as it was never shipped. Even now, the description says that it usally ships in 1-2 weeks. I ordered this item on Dec 12 and was told to expect it by Dec 29th. As that date approached, I requested an updated status. The response cane from someone in India. Apparently Amazon is one of those companies that have sent US jobs offshore. In any case, they have since changed my delivery date to the end of Jan!!! I have cancelled my order and, after many years of dealing with Amazon, I will no longer return. I can't stand to see these companies sending our jobs overseas so that their CEO's can have more & more while the lower & middle class keeps loosing."
1,A waste of money,"I bought this software primarily because of two advertised features:Ability to import from DayTimer (yes, I have the old DayTimer software)All those print formatsSo... it doesn't 'import from DayTimer' at all. You must export into a csv file, map the csv file to Anytime format, and then, Anytime will import your data, ignoring the detailed mapping you just did, so that addresses end up in telephone number fields, personal names in organization name... and some data I never found at all (and this is just addresses!)And the print... well, my life is not scheduled in hour increments, half hour calendars suit me better.. and yes, you can select half hour increments. However, when you do that, you only get half a day!I'm deleting this from my hard drive, and writing off the cost as an educational expense (Since I've learned to be more careful before buying software)"
1,Lacklustre... at least,"First impression - not impressed.Further on - worse.I purchased this very inexpensive product ($7 or $8) for one purpose: use its address book to enter data and print it out, properly centered and both sides, in 6 inches by 3 inches, for my paper organizer...in Cyrillics.At the first attempt I managed to enter the data in the required alphabet, but in print those characters were garbled .Second attempt - no characters, even Latin, at all, empty page.I tried to contact the tech support by three different methods to no avail.They never wrote or called me back."
3,Bit disappointed,"This is a very simple item which I am hoping will help my elderly mother cope with pulling plugs out sockets. Sadly, the space for the plug cable to go through is very narrow and I can't use it for the appliance it was purchased for - my mother's GE toaster oven - without my adapting it. This is fine for normal slim cords but is not suitable for thicker ones. Sad that the gap for the cord isn't larger."
4,Excellent saw for the price,"The saw went together with no problems, but as a couple of other people noted, mine had a table that was far from flat. I called Jet, and they sent me a new table right away, and that one is well within spec for flatness. I was not impressed with the 3/4"" blade supplied with the saw, so I ordered a ""Woodslicer"" from Highland Woodworking, which does a great job. I have resawed with no noticable blade drift, except one time when I forgot to tension the blade.Since I have used the saw for a number of angled cuts, my biggest complaint is with the small trunions and angle scale for the table tilt, and difficulty of getting the table adjusted to the proper angle. I have a very inexpensive Craftsman 8"" bandsaw that has a micrometer-type table angle adjustment so you can easily dial in the angle you need. I wish this saw had something like that."
5,Saw well worth the price,This saw works as I expected and it is well worth the price I compared a number of different saws and this one exceeds expectations on price and quality.
5,Powerhouse!,"I purchased this bandsaw because I burned out the smaller Delta I had. I thought it might be too big for my small space but once I set it up I found it does not take up a lot of room. I also thought its weight might be too much to handle but I can slide it without too much trouble when I need to. I have not yet entered onto a larger project but the dozen or so times I've used it, ranging from 3/4"" stock to 2x4's, it cut smoothly and effortlessly. The blade does not wobble at all so it is no problem cutting a straight line. Large curves were easy (I have the 3/4"" standard blade now) but I will be getting a 3/8"" blade for finer work. Also I thought the 1 1/2 HP motor would be loud but it is not as loud as a circular saw. All in all, it seems to be a powerful, smooth, efficient saw that I envision using for many, many years."
2,"Cuts okay, but what a pain in the...","I agree with all the good things said about this saw's power, smoothness, and quietness. BUT... the odd blade size means you'll pay more and have to special order - that's takes time.But the real killer design flaw in this machine is the lower guide arrangement. It's virtually inaccesible, even with the special hex wrench Jet gives you (lose that puppy and you're SOL). The guide wheels secure with thumbscrews that an average hand can't reach without mangling your flesh, and there's so little room you can't wear gloves. The guide base flops all around and is hard to see and almost impossible to align properly. I've been using bandsaws for 40 years - so I KNOW it needn't take half an hour to change a blade, then another half hour to readjust it over and over.If you change blades often, stay away!"
4,Reading this will be the best mistake you'll make,"A successful traveling food writer, Faith reluctantly returns to her Minnesota roots to aid her flighty sister in turning a profit on the bar they own together. She does not count on having to run into Flynn, her first (and only) love. Ten years earlier, Flynn gave her an ultimatum - marry him or move on. She chose to move on to LA with a bass player (which comes up in several humorous conversations).As she tries to salvage the bar and renew a friendship with Flynn, old wounds are opened, and she finds herself falling for Flynn all over again, Faith turns to her halfwit sister for romantic advice with mixed results. Can either of them forget their past misdeeds and try to forge ahead by learning to trust each other?Filled with a lot of longing on both sides, Kendrick does a great job of creating completing characters, injecting witty dialogue into every day situations, and making the reader feel like they are in the room with the characters."
4,Fab characters,"Somebody else mentioned the cover, so I wasn't the only one who checked this out because of the eyecatching photo. Kendrick created a story and characters with a sense of humor, great female relationships and characters with multiple facets. I loved Faith the most, and would definitely read another Kendrick book."
3,3 1/2 stars,"This wasn't my favorite book by this author, but it was a quick and easy read. I got tired of the back and forth between Faith and Flynn and by the end, didn't really care if they got together or not. The dim-wit sister constantly calling ""Faithie"" also got annoying."
4,Hilarious romantic comedy...,"Faith Geary left behind her small town home ten years ago, not ever intending to return. That all changes when her sister Skye calls in tears, on the verges of bankruptcy and divorce. Even then, Faith doesn't intend to return, but then she gets one more call, from Patrick Flynn, her once upon a time love who delivers the killing blow that sends her back to Minnesota. Skye's pregnant. Faith can't stay away while she is so needed after that.**** Stepping back home is stepping into chaos. Flynn is still angry at her for leaving, Skye is irresponsible as ever, the bar whose mortgage she co-signed is teetering on the edge of going under with her life savings, and all her old feelings are coming back to life. Romantic tensions run high and laughs are plentiful in this heartwarming read. Toward the end of the book, there are two absalutely priceless scenes that will have you rolling on the floor, giggling. ****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews."
1,Please...,"I agree with another reviewer. This book was readable, but the characters did nothing for me. Oftentimes, I felt the author was trying too hard to be funny. How did the girls turn the bar around...did they turn it around? I mean that why Faith went back to the town. I didn't see the heroine build much of anything. She was too busy trying to please everybody and in turn I didn't care for her too much. I wanted Flynn to stop with the ultimatiums and expecting everything to be HIS way. His last temper tantrum just disappeared the moment the heroine relented and decided to stay in town. That all he wanted in the first place. I kept waiting for the hero to sweep me off my feet or even her, but it never happened. Maybe the next book will be better."
3,"Not chick lit, should have been mass market ...","Despite what most would say, there *IS* a difference between those mass market sized romances and trade size paperback chick lit books. Almost immediately this turned into a mass market romance. It wasn't bad, but it was a romance with silly scenes and a predictable ending."
5,I love them too,"About twenty years ago I did visit the mountain gorillas in what was, at that tome, called Zaire (today this is Congo). It was a flabbergasting experience. I always wanted to go back but.......still nowadays, the troubles in that part of N-E Congo are still going on. A few months ago I did notice a trip going to the gorillas from the Uganda-site, and I took the opportunity with both hands. At Travellers Rest in Kisoro I did see a copy of the concerning book. Waw, I wanted to have this very beautiful book too because ""I do love them too, those magnificent animals"""
1,Garbage,"cheap material that may cost them $5 to make, and they listed it for $60. I got it for $30 with a thought of it was a good design. Turned out that it is a piece of garbage. Once my car reach 30 mph, it starts shaking and making noise, I was too afraid to go on highway.Save your money for a better rack!"
1,DVI port does not work!,"Be careful! Do not buy this card. The DVI port only works in analog mode with the DVI-analog converter only. The DVI port in the digital mode sends absolutely no signal to the monitor. This is a bug that has been reported by many clients of this card on the forum of the eVGA site, under 7 series cards.Also, this card only has GDDR2 memory, as stated under the technical details, and not as reported under the product description.Had I known of this defect I would have not purchased this card by eVGA. eVGA tech support failed to reply to my email regarding my defective card."
2,Weak,"The great failure of this film is not its acting, that is obvious from the talent assembled. It is not in the props. The props are absolutely perfect in authenticity. What sinks the film is the screenplay, Downey's one-dimentional depiction of Chaplin, and a director too clueless to notice what these were doing to his picture. According to his leading ladies, Chaplin was only depressed and brooding when he was creatively blocked. In Chaplin he is depicted as always depressed. There isn't one montage to show him as the directorial dirvige he was described as being by those who knew him. Instead of directing Downey out of this emotional rut, he plods along through Chaplin's life like a man walking from fencepost to fencepost. Ebert was right, the parts are there for a much better film; too bad no one made it."
3,Ahh...What Could Have Been...,"First of all, what a great RDJ performance. He WAS Chaplin. It was such a shame the movie itself is such a mixed bag. I am sure it was difficult to tell a life story in such a limited amount of time and Sir Attenborough did the best job he could do I suppose.The Blu Ray transfer looked fine to me. Features were not that impressive. Some interviews, none with RDJ, and I was pleasantly surprised that Sir Attenborough acknowledged the films failings and said he wished he could do it again!"
2,Older movie but endearing,"Good movie a little older but not to bad. Robert Downey Jr. Is darling here...a little long but Im ""no worse"" for the wear..."
5,Chaplain was a classic,"Chaplain was a classic production, accurate documentation, and great casting. Robert Downey was great, and it was a special connection to have Geraldine Chaplin in the portrayal of Charlie's mother. I love movies set in a different time period, with accuracy."
4,fantastic movie (dont have to even know who chaplin is),i just adore robert downey jrs work as both a singer and an ACTOR. he truly has done some AWESOME work. i am so glad he is clean and sober and i hope he and his family have the best before them. AND you really must listen to his music. BUT his work in this movie should have gotten him an award as he truly hits chaplin on the nose
5,Really 4.5 But Hey....,"Fine acting throughout. Perhaps made Charlie a little better than he was, and sentimental, but good narrative flow. I never thought anything of Robert Downey's acting till now (Iron Man, oh, please!) but here's a case of a fine talent wasted for the most part so far."
5,Detailed dive into dynamic comic...,"This film truly is a masterpiece. It's a crime Robert Downey Jr. didn't win the oscar for this role that he filled perfectly. The portrail of Chaplin does not skim over his faults. And although the film doesn't delve too deep into Chaplin's darker side, it goes beneath the glossy surface you are likely to have seen in biography shows on TV.Touchs on all the major events in the life of Charlie Chaplin."
5,A Robert Downey Jr. triumph.,"This excelleant biopic based on Chaplins life is only somewhat overshadowed by Robert Downey Jr's terrific performance. This was of course before his personal problems cut off his promising career. Thank goodness he conquered his problems and has returned and once again proven the excellant actor that he is. Bravo for ""Chaplin"" and Bravo for Robert downey Jr. And of course Bravo for Anthony Hopkins as director."
3,It's okay,"The film was in excellent condition and met my expectations, but I wasn't able to play on the DVD, nor my Play Station. I even had some troubles to play in my computer.By the way, although the price was good, the shipping price was too expensive, I believe."
1,Unlikely,I have received 2 copies of this movie and neither one of them plays. I love the movie itself so I'm very disappointed it doesn't work!
4,It's Chaplin and Robert Downey's film,"There are absolutely no other actors who could protrait Charlie Chaplin as brilliantly as Robert Downey Jr. did in this film, with the look, the physicality and the acting capacity. Period! The actor should have won the Oscar for this. I only wished, after watching it, the film could cover more on Chaplin's film making side."
4,Chaplin,"This movie is enjoyable even if you aren't familiar with Charlie Chaplin films, but is wonderfully resonant if you are. The real Chaplin onscreen is made of Teflon: the worst things happen to him and he just keeps dancing. Offscreen, his life was troubled to say the least. ""Chaplin"" does a good job of wordlessly illuminating this apparent tension: by showing what laughter meant to the child of a deranged mother, the brilliance of the California sunshine to someone raised under English skies, and the struggle for marital peace in a workaholic, constantly changing world of pretenders and, in the guise of J. Edgar Hoover and his minions, hostile critics. Charlie Chaplin comes across as a man unable to exorcise his demons verbally, but brilliantly trying to through the language of dance, eyebrows, and unending farce. The man had no vanity onscreen, but he ended up being beautiful."
4,Nice look into Charlie's life!,"This is a very good movie about the life and work of the greatest genius in film history. Robert Downey Jr. is superb as Charlie! He captures Charlie's mannerisms, his wit and his sadness. Watch as Geraldine Chaplin plays the role of her real grandmother."
3,"Good, but cursory, biography of Chaplin","Of course, any movie would be a 'cursory' look at the 88-year-long life of Charles Chaplin. This movie attempts to cover too many areas of his life and is therefore shallow. However, Downey is incredible. He not only bears a distinct resemblance to the young Chaplin, but his performance is uncanny. Diane Lane as Paulette Goddard has a striking, glamorous presence. Dan Aykroyd as Mack Sennett is amusing. However, who decided to cast Moira Kelly as Chaplin's beloved wife Oona? She is mousy and nondescript--both in her appearance and in her demeanor--while Oona was neither. This movie will give the viewer a brief overview of Chaplin's life, but read a good biography to learn more."
5,This is an okay re-release,"The first time this came out on DVD was in 1998 I believe. The new release differs in the sense that it's a cleaned up print and that it's also enhanced for 16x9 televisions, where as the original wasn't. If you watched the original on a wide screen TV it was letter boxed. As far as special features go for this one, there's about 3 new featurettes that are less than 10 minutes long as well as some home movie footage of Charlie Chaplin and of course a trailer.Unfortunately there are no deleted scenes. I suspect that this release has come out only due to Robert Downey Jr's rise in popularity again. But it's good to see it on DVD with a cleaner print and enhanced for today's televisions. I have given this a 5 star rating because it's a good film none-the-less and a must watch for fans of Chaplin."
5,Very good movie,"The movie to me should receive five stars; the acting was phenominal on Robert Downey Jr.'s part, as well as others in the story. The story line itself was complete, from birth to death of Charlie Chaplin."
4,no title,"I thought this a fine film with lots of wonderful actors - how can you go wrong with Kevin Kline and Anthony Hopkins? Never felt long at 2 1/2 hours. Robert Downey, Jr. was fantastic; he deserved the Oscar nomination. Perhaps not enough substance, which is why I didn't give it five stars."
5,Robert Downey Jr can act!,"From the director of great movie autobiographies such as Gandhi, and Cry Freedom, Chaplin hooks you right from the start. Simply, it's an interesting story. How a ragamuffin from the poor end of London became the most famous man in the world is wonderful.Robert Downey Jr will always be able to look at this piece of work as his finest (forget Air America and all the news about addictions, this piece of film-work will keep him fondly remembered)Footnote:When all movies were still silent flickering images, Chaplin made features dealing with controversial topics such as racism, and fascism, which lead the US authorities, particularly J Edgar Hoover, to brand Chaplin a communist, and have him kicked out of the USA. Chaplin deserved better, and had to wait until the 1970s before he was remembered and recognised by his peers in America."
4,A piece of history worth recollecting,"A lot can be said as to how authentic the passages in the movie were but it takes nothing away from the excellent acting and the important recollection of early movie history. For many later generations (my own included) Chaplin has stood as a mere comedian, Buster Keatons 'successor' who bridged the gap into the talking movies etc. There was so much more to the man not the least his increasing political statements that in the end led to him being expelled from the US during the Communist witch hunt haydays......I certainly learned a lot from this movie and while being mesmorized by particularly Robert Downey Jr's performance I gained an appetite for learning more about this remarkable little English man, all the while I was thoroughly entertained.To me a big 4 stars (which you will realise from the body of my reviews is very very rare)"
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I LOVE the movie, let's be clear about that. I currently own the 15th Anniversary Edition on standard DVD, and wanted to purchase a Blu-Ray to go with our upgraded TV and player. Unfortunately, the order I placed with third party iNetVideo Fufillment for the BLU RAY version (advertised here) went awry. Although the description and picture CLEARLY state this is a Blu-ray disc you are ordering, I recieved a STANDARD DVD (definitely NOT what I ordered). I'm not sure if the company doesn't understand that the two are not the same, or if the workers in charge of packaging do not, but this kind of mistake is certainly a glaring one. I will be getting a refund through Amazon. This is either a communication mix up within the company, or deceptive advertising (if someone thinks that no one is going to notice the difference between a Blu Ray and DVD - that's insane - esp. since you can get a standard DVD of the same movie for HALF the price)! BEWARE!Chaplin (15th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]"
2,No good...,"They just feel awkward...Also, when I was doing some pull-ups, I had a lot of difficulty getting off the bar because I couldn't unhook myself. Doing curls, they offer no support. My friend has the type where it's a strap that wraps around whatever you like, he seems to like those a lot more, I might just give it a try."
3,"Decent for the price, but I'd recommend a better hook","I bought these to replace some old Atlas hooks that were starting to fall apart after years of heavy lifting. These hooks are of a decent size and fit around a standard bar as you'd expect, but they aren't terribly comfortable. The best thing about these hooks is the price compared to other lifting hooks -- they'll get the job done (up to a point) on a frugal budget. The design of the hooks allows you to also grip the bar with your fingers which is nice, but the hooks slant outward whenever weight is applied and it just doesn't feel stable.A friend of mine bought the Haulin' Hooks the same week that I bought these, and after trying them I immediately upgraded to a pair of those as well. These will be kept around as a backup set or for friends that are lifting lighter weights."
2,Hooks to small,I purchased these to help with getting back in shape and the problem I have is the hooks are to small to fit around any bar or equipment handle in the gym with the exceptions of dumbbells smaller than 20 lbs. I can't even use them.
2,I'm too short for it.,"I'm 5ft9in. This product is too long for my hands. My fingers barely wrap around the bar while I'm deadlifting. It feels really odd, and I think it affects my form."
2,Needs to be adjustable but isn't,"The hooks hang from the wrist strap at a fixed length, so if this length is not what fits you, you will end up not being able to hold the bar with your hands. In my case, my wrist-to-fingertips distance is short, so the hooks hang down too far, making it impossible to use them effectively. Some sort of mechanism to shorten/lengthen the hook distance would make this product much better."
2,Dont work well for any grips that are padded.,"At my gym, many of the grips are padded. This padding makes the grip thicker or bigger in diameter; now the lifting hook no longer fits.Roughly 50% of the back excercises have to be done on some sort of machine (rather than just using a bar + wieght or dumbells). Probably want to check all the excercise that in your routine and insure that they don't have any sort of padding on the grip.Also, it is difficult to set minute adjustments on the hook's height in your hand. Example, if you have the strap too tight, the hooks may hold the bar up by your thumb. Have the strap too loose, and the bar may be down by your second knuckle (when ideally you'd have the bar in the middle of your palm)."
2,Don't really like the feel.,Quality built but I don't really like the feel. I've got wide hands and the two hooks are inside my hands so I have to have my index finger and my pinki finger ouside the hooks (feels funny and can pinch a little bit). also have to have your wrists lined up at a 90 degree angle with the bar so this can be awkward also.
1,These are inadvertently disposable,"I don't have the money to buy wrist hooks for each and every back targeted workout I do, but I guess if I did, and if this product boasted its excellence as a disposable item, I'd give it a couple extra starts. Contrarily, these are meant for multiple uses, but you will find that you can only use them once before they self destruct. The Velcro is configured so that it tears itself up structurally like a rabid dog eating it's own flesh, like an arsonist torching his own home, like an attorney melting down and sabotaging his own case, like a dictator selling out his country to Western corporatocracy. These hooks suck that bad and the sad part is it would be so easy for the company to modify the product and circumnavigate the failure. Until then, SPRI can suck it and suck it well."
3,More than a little bit more of the same.,"Titles of books can be as misleading as titles given to anything else. If, for example, you purchased a CD claiming to be the best Hit Records of your favourite group or solo artist - you would not expect to find anything other than those particular songs recorded. So what does ""Master Photography"" mean? Is it an invitation to purchase this book and learn how to master photography or is this a book for those who are ready for an advanced stage where they learn secrets from the Master's themselves?Sadly it is neither. In a book filled with excellent graphics and totally uninspiring photographs, this book appears to be a rehash of all the usual suspects - you know all the usual sections and subjects from equipment to techniques. I get the feeling that if you already have a book by Michael Busselle - then you probably already have most of this one.Once again, difficult to categorise this particular work.NM"
1,Flynn Hits Rock Bottom,"The most devoted Errol Flynn fan will have a tough time sitting through 68 minutes of no-budget exploitation fodder. A dissipated, cash-strapped Flynn helped assemble this ludicrous ""docudrama"" on the Cuban Revolution. Once you get past Errol's lumbering six-minute introduction (the swashbuckling star plays himself as a ""representative of the Hearst press""), the movie takes a nosedive into sheer awfulness - with plenty of non-acting to go around. Barely released after his death, ""Cuban Rebel Girls"" (1959) was Flynn's last and worst film venture."
5,Excellent explanation of Neurofeedback.,Very useful book on neurofeedback by a long time expert. Explanations are direct and clearly written. A must read for anyone interested in healing.
3,Inspires Action,"A good book, less so for it's style and more for the nature of the subject matter. It's a little tedious at times getting lost in details and anecdotes however I liked the authenticity of it given the author has included his own experiences using the technology.If you're at a loose end with yourself or a significant other it could well encourage you to explore the realm of neurofeedback. I certainly did and am very glad for it. It is somewhat dated though and newer, more advanced technology is on the market. I'm about half-way through a program using the LENS system by OCHS Labs and while I can't deride any of the other technology have been quite impressed by the changes I'm experiencing using the LENS system.btw I'm not being paid by OCHS Labs. Have no affiliation with them!"
4,A good read,"It is a good intro book to the field of Brain Wave Biofeedback tech. However, it can get very repetitious at times. Could use more tech data."
5,Great book on the history of brain wave biofeedback,I wanted a book that would explore where brain wave biofeedback began and where it is now and future outlook. Book served the purpose very well.
2,Deeply Disappointing,"Reads like a bad script for an infomercial on Coral Calcium. I grew weary of the persistant defensiveness of those in the industry (No, no, it's real Science!) as well as the attacks on an ambiguously-defined, western, medical machine that won't fund clinical trials that would dispell all doubt.Honestly, this book was recommended by a clinician as an introduction prior to therapy. I can truly say that I am far less inclined to undergo EEG Neurobiofeedback after reading this book than I was walking in with no prior knowledge of the therapy.I can't speak to Robbins' coverage of the history of the field. However, as for the tecnology itself, he does little more than relate a few glowing case studies, echo the claims of practicioners, and sumarize his own minimal experience. Absent a single citation from another publication (peer reviewed or otherwise) I am left in search of further reading for guidance."
3,Creative scenario of future threats to world peace.,In spite of previous reviewers complaints over technical shortcomings in the text I feel this book has value. As we are all aware the cold war is over. But what does this mean? Are there no potential new threats to peace. This question occupies the time of many military strategic studies think tanks. The books value lies in the credible scenario the author has woven from contemporary players on the world stage. The Asian area may be a future threat as well but this book is an admirable readable look at the Gulf area.
2,HELLO HYPE,"How and why does a book like this become so popular? Whoever designed the cover art deserves an award because it's best thing about the book. I'm wondering how many people (besides me) got suckered into buying this stinker BECAUSE of the art and a couple of well placed ads in book reviews. I waited and waited for the story to improve but after the carrier explodes, it's all downhill from there. Besides the factual errors, it had to have had the worst (and shortest) climatic battle scene ever printed. Had to check the page numbers to make sure some hadn't been ripped out."
2,Not realistic - contrived.,"I was struck by this younger officer who was the ONLY physicist in the U.S. to know that the sinking wasn't an accident. Didn't other physicists learn the same things in Nuclear Fission 101? In today's world, Good Morning America and Today would have trotted out their own pet nuclear experts the very next morning and theories would have been bouncing off TV satellites. Give me a break!! An admiral that shakes his fist in the air and exclaims ""What a man!"" (about the pres) The admiral was so juvenile that I began fearing for our national safety. The admiral's chief thrill in life was driving at 100+ MPH down the B/W Parkway. Anyone who drives the Parkway would be more than happy to see him busted---the Parkway is not a place for excessive speeds especially from such a low-level mind. The ending was even worse. Sorry I listened to the tape. Luckily I borrowed from the library and didn't buy."
3,4 Stars or 2 Stars,"This book is basically a lifelike narrative of a naval event. It dots its i's and crosses its t's in a precise fashion. To enjoy this book, you really should like the navy and be partially familiar with how the navy works. If you don't, a lot of it will sound like yada, yada, yada.One literary drawback is the multitude of characters. The tale was swapping characters so often that I didn't really get a chance to identify with any character in particular. However, to create a story that could be plausible or nearly so, I suspect the character switching was necessary (it gave it a more realistic feel). If you love literary devices, this is not the book for you. It's very plain prose with lots of detail delivered in a nearly military fashion.I suspect that the book appeals to techno geeks with at least a little military bent (like me). John Q Public picking this up on a lark will probably be bored and disappointed."
2,Mind candy reading,"The book is great mind candy reading, perfect for a winter day when you don't have anything else to do. The character interaction especially amongst the U.S. Naval Officers is a little silly. Lieutenant Commanders do not call Admirals by their first name period! Technically there were quite a number of goofs.. too bad the author didn't have an American technical advisor when writing about the U.S. Navy.."
3,No surprise ending,"Very well written and Mr. Robinson gave a great account of submarine tactics and warfare. However, there were no surprises throughout the book and the ending was rather predictable."
5,A Brit Who Knows,"Patrick Robinson is a great action read! If there are a few technical errors, who cares? Mr. Robinson has moved to #2 on my must read list. It is best if you read ""Nimitz Class"" before you read ""H. M. S. Unseen"". This is a work of fiction and the characters are fiction, but there are continuing references throughout the Robinson ""series"" to one non-fiction individual. Robinson, a Brit, knows what a jerk this person is, and was!"
1,great idea gone wrong,started ok but got worse went over and over the same ground.The bloke who wrote stis must be a right wing thatcher fan
2,"Gripping, but full of implausabilities and simple errors.","One reviewer has already pointed out the unbelievable failure too differentiate between Arabs and Iranians. The thought that a secret agent could make it in northern Iran because he spoke ""a little Arabic"" is ludicrous. He would stand out like a sore thumb. Arabic is about as much like Farsi as English is like Swedish. The only similarity is the alphabet. Oh, by the way, Verdi didn't compose an overture to Rigoletto. There is a very short introduction and the curtain rises."
3,Writer Needs to Do More Research and Editing,"Mr. Robinson has provided his readers with an entertaining read that is very lacking in accuracy. There are significant errors with naval rank and history. So many in fact, that the lack of attention to detail ultimately diminished my overall enjoyment of the book. I have not yet read Kilo Class and HMS UNSEEN is already in the stores so I can only hope that he learned from the criticisms of his first work. As I said, the book was entertaining and probably even more so for readers lacking real knowledge of naval operations. What was readily apparent is that Mr. Robinson was never in either the U.S. or Royal Navy and that he is nowhere near as good a writer of undersea warfare stories as Michael DiMercurio (who graduated from the US Naval Academy and served aboard submarines). Don't pay hardcover prices for these books. Wait for the paperback or better yet, get them from the library."
1,Ugh,"I knew this was a stinker when a group of US Navy guys are talking about the Boston Redsox ""First Batsman"" (leadoff hitter). Gimme a break. Did this author have an editor? If you can believe the US would go after Iran - which did nothing, and do nothing to Iraq - which nuked a carrier.. then this is right up your alley."
3,Nothing unique except maybe the author's writing style,The book is interesting however you relay must like description to last through this. The author Patrick Robinson spends a lot more time on detail than he does story. He loves lots of dialog and still has time to describe expressions.The primes and the technology are not new but it is accurate. And the scenario is not surprise ether as this has been accounted for in numerous History Channel programs. Basically a diesel submarine lays in wait for the aircraft carrier to pass and nukes it. The mystery is who and why. The speculation is mostly based on real facts and history.
1,Kiff life,What a load of trash. I recommend this book to anyone who likes wasting money on stupid books when they could purchase brilliant books like The One Who Got Away.
3,Not wanting to say anything overtly bad,"I would not particularly recommend this book for those seeking fast-paced, realistic military thrillers. I would recommend books by those who have actually worn a uniform and piloted a plane or sweated under the weight of a heavy ruck. Such as Stephen Coonts or Bob Mayer. Check their books out."
3,Dragged out and boring at times,"Although the author punctuates his story with a few paragraphs of action and suspense, for the most part the book begs to be put down. I found that I really looked forward to the book ending, and became upset when I found that the main character still had alot to do before his mission was complete. The ending was dissappointing and obvious. The book is not really worth the paper its printed on.."
2,"This author needs to read ""The Elements of Style.""","Since when are ""yessir"" and ""nossir"" words? What dictionary is Robinson using? And, how, about, the, abundance, of, useless, commas?Plus, the unnecessary vulgar language put me off. Why throw in a ""f**k"" or ""goddammit"" (again, a new word) for no reason? Like those words will really make me pay more attention to what the top officials in our armed forces say.Also, the forced relationship between the playboy Commander and the MARRIED Laura smacked of the typical disrespect of the marriage covenant--not to mention the fact that they only knew each other for 12 hours before they ""fell in love.""Lastly--since when are US subs/ships equipped with nuclear weapons? Do your research, Robinson!"
1,Not even *remotely* in Tom Clancy's league,"I'm soooooo glad I *borrowed* a copy of this book. :-) I won't comment on the technical failings of the book (that's been done well enough by the other reviewers) suffice it to say that the premise of the book, suppose to be so realistic that ""tomorrow it could be news"", is laughable.As a writer, Robinson isn't worthy to be Tom Clancy's boot strap. OK, OK, in the techno-thriller genre we don't expect literary masterpieces, but Robinson's writing is so bad as to be laughable. The plot actually gets *bogged down* through the middle third of the book -- a capital crime in the genre. The characterisations are ridiculously sketchy and/or cliched, even for a technothriller. Buy one of Clancy's you haven't read, get a subscription to Jane's defence weekly, watch ""The Hunt for Red October"" again, call your mum, just do anything but buy this book (it'll only encourage him)."
2,Hard Going,"This is not the sort of book that you can easily pick up and read, although I was being to warm to it towards the end of the book.The latter descriptions of the British Navy seem somewhat more plausible than the earlier descriptions of the US Carrier Battle Group. Some of the terminology was inaccurate as were some of the grades associated with the characters in the book"
1,Stick with Clancy/Brown/Carroll/etc.,"We've all (most/many/some of us have) read the above authors, and are familiar with the accepted novelized versions of Navy fighter pilot jargon. It is unfortunate that Patrick Robinson has not read these authors, and had no clue. Mr. Robinson, you claim to have used military advisors on this project. Were they awake? At least Hollywood MAY hire some REAL advisors to clean up the jargon and technical aspects. Even his prose describing a fighter crash has no ring of reality or even plausibility.Can I change the rating to 0?Can I get my money back???? ;-)"
4,"Good, but a bit boring in parts","Patrick Robinson may have made some minor mistakes with rank etc, but ignoring that I tought it was quite a good book. It did have some quite boring parts, and there was a big build-up to the 'action' bits, which were not as detailed as the rest of the book."
1,Plot leads to nothing.,"The author is certainly an expert on U.S. and British naval policies and procedures, but the book ultimately fizzles. For a country (ultimately identified) and/or a world leader (ultimately identified) to use a nuclear weapon against the United States, and suffer no comparable retaliation, is just plain silly."
1,Great Premise - but doesn't deliver,"The concept behind the book was excellent, however, it went nowhere. The first 100 pages were okay. Not great or gripping, but okay. Then the author droned on about who blew up the ship and why and how this one junior navy officer was going to figure out the whole thing. The story just did not hold my interest. I will also concur with another reviewer that the dialogue between the bad guys was hideous. I felt embarrased. Anyway, there are way to many GOOD book out there so I gave up on this one, something I rarely do. The book really needs to be a stinker before I bail. This was. Avoid it.If I could give this 1/2 a star I would"
5,Super story for submarine fans,"That was one of the best books I have read on modern submarine warfare and the story was also very good. The elimination of a US supercarrier by a single nuclear-tipped torpedo was presented in an exciting way, as was the hunting of the renegade submarine that followed. The episode of the British sub passing through the Bosporus Straights was absolutely marvellous and I wish Robinson had devoted some more pages to the hunting of the enemy sub, instead of discovering it by chance."
3,robinson,Quite a yarn spinner. Great beach read tons of facts (unverified) plus lots of BS and a load of political opinions Robinson not only kissed his Irish Blarney stoneHe camped out on it for a full summer sacrificing his annual visit to Cape Cod Well worth a couple of pounds
2,Trained monkeys could write better than this.,"Despite numerous misgivings, I would have to give this book two stars because I actually finished it. The author's bizarre fascination with Kansas should have set warning bells off in my head. Furthermore, the inane dialogue between the Iraqi (or was it Iranian?) sub ace and his half-witted First Officer was some of the most atrocious writing since Danielle Steele got her first typewriter. A word of advice to the journalist-turned-author: stick to writing horoscopes and obituaries."
1,An aircraft carrier disappears -- so does the story,"I'm a frequent bus rider in a large metropolitan city, so I find myself reading lots of books. I was especially thrilled to pick up NIMITZ CLASS to help pass the time by reading a fictional account of a disaster that could potentially become reality in the near future. I was VERY disappointed to find that this novel is a lumbering mess -- a story about American reaction to a worldwide calamity told by a Brit with no sense for our culture. The dialogue is laughable; the technical explanations far from accurate. The whole book seemed to be structured like a fat balloon that was slowly loosing air. An iceberg would have been a better nemisis than the convulted mess created by Robinson. My advice to anyone contemplating picking up this door stop: Stick with Tom Clancy novels."
1,It seems I know more than the *author*,2 out of 10 for the author for finding a publisher to print this junk. This guy doesn't even know that Iranians are not Arabs.
1,About as bad as is gets,"Somehow, I don't know how or why, I finished this book. With such a lame story line, and with characters so thin they would undoubtedly blow off the deck of the aircraft carrier referred to in the title, I just have one request of the publisher: please compensate me for the time I wasted reading this book. I'll accept a cash or store credit.Every aspect of this book was so obvious and uninteresting that the most defining characteristic of the story is just how irritating it is. The romantic element made me want to retch, but so did many of the other characters...on second thought, maybe the horrible romantic scenes fit just perfectly.If you read this book, you're doing yourself (and the literature industry) as dis-service."
3,Quit While You're Ahead,"RE: AUDIO TAPE VERSION. This story reminds me of a professor I had who would grade the first page or two of a paper with, ""Excellent analysis, A+"", but then on succeeding pages, ""You should have stopped here: B"" and then, ""You've overreached and lost focus: final grade: C-"". Robinson has earned a mark of ""very average"" by substituting quantity for quality. His editors stumbled also since several lengthy episodes could have been cut not only because they failed to advance the plot, but they simply weren't believable. The audio performance was consistent and generally entertaining but became tiresome due to the excessive length. And Finally, does anyone else have a problem with the title? ""Nimitz Class"" lacks flair and misrepresents a story more about submarines than carriers."
1,"would rate zero stars, if available","An absolutely abominable book. Puerile prose, plastic characters and a preposterous plot make for an utterly miserable read. Welcome to the world of the right wing military nut who doesn't know his subject, but spouts off regardless. Quite similar to Limbaugh. Don't waste your money or time."
1,Dont bother,"I found this book started off well, but after the carrier is lost it starts to drag out. The author drags out conversations and rehashes information several times. For over half of the book the reader knows the plainly obvious, which is not that bad, but some of the conclusions drawn and actions taken by the Americans are just downright outrageous. You don't get a sense that he is writing from two different perspectives. The action really never picks up, and the ending is not climactic at all. Downright disappointing. If you have read or even like Tom Clancy, don't bother with this book. In fact, don't bother at all, whoever you are."
3,Interesting war facts about carrier and naval tactics,Interesting description of carrier and naval battle tactics but as a novel it moved somewhat slow and it was a bit too predictale. The first half was gripping but the second half was so so.
1,Absolutely Awful,"This is one of the worst books that I have ever read. Numerous factual errors, horrible character development, meaningless plot twists, and muddled political bombasts sum up this work of technotrash. I kept reading only to see how stupid the ending would be, and I wasn't disappointed."
3,Pulls you through and leaves you wanting...,"I found myself extremely dissappointed by the ending to this book. The 'Grand Finale' of 450+ pages takes 5 pages to play out. In reality the book plays it much like it would probably happen in real life but that's boring (in real life a fight may only take 30 seonds but it's much more fun watching Jackie Chan fight for 3 minutes in a movie). The above may seem like a petty problem but much of the book is spent establishing the antagonist's credentials as a supreme submarine commander. You keep waiting for the better equipped American navy to go out and do battle with this genius but it never happens. I have no idea why many authors seem to rush the conclusion of a book but this, in my opinion, is one of the worst cases of this I have seen. Perhaps the author thought it was clever but it left me wanting."
1,couldn't finish it,"The title, the cover, the fly leaf all suckered me in to buying this- thought we had a new Clancy or Poyer. Then a sub sneaks through the screen and launches a torpdo to sink the Jefferson. I was in the Navy, involved with CIC operations, and in a hot area like this, someone would be active. Even forgiving this area, I was STUNNED no one heard the torpedo! This weapon zooms at 40 knots and EVERYONE within site distance of a pair of sonar headphones would have heard that! Amazing. I forgave that error (since I had spent $25), but continued to find so many more...just wish I could get my money back..."
5,Spunky Monkey,"I purchased this item as a gift for a monkey lover. I thought this product was awsome, creative, and equally unique from any of the other monkey items I found over the internet."
3,Acceptable,"The quality is fine. There is good support of the tummy. However, it's not that much better than Flexees Women's Firm Control Hi Cut Brief #5044, which is half the cost."
4,Busty Cops,"Softcore, softcore, softcore galore. Big Breasted Pornstars act as cops to but a train robbery. While on the job you see 5 star softcore featuring mostly girl on girl action."
3,Decent T&A,Pretty good movie with a adequate amount of skin. And that should be the determining criteria. The plot and dialogue are not that interesting.
2,"Some nice nudity, but very little effort at eroticism...","Whoever produces these videos doesn't respect their customers very much. Yes, there's busty women, and yes, there's nudity. But with just a little effort, particularly regarding their girl/girl scenes, this thing could have been really hot!Instead, they set-up their girl/girl encounters with hardly any effort at all. Still, one the positive side, the women are all beautiful and there are more women-with-women scenes than women-with-men. I just wish they'd hire a writer with some understanding of erotica."
3,not much nudity,the first 1 had more nudity with the 3 leading ladies & the ending of the 1st is better.
5,The heart of Ireland,"If you would know Ireland, don't read McCourt or Cahill; read Alice Taylor. This book is typical of her work in revealing the island as it actually is and not as some do who have an agenda and don't hesitate to ""spin"" the description to attain the reaction they want. Excellent writing from a truly extraordinary woman with a heart as big as the Republic."
1,Not worth the money,"For the price, you are not getting enough to bother having it shipped. The amount is basically for one recipe, and the raisins are very dry and gritty, not as pump and sweet as other brands. I will not order this product again."
2,Disapointed,I have had mine for less than two years and used it for making pens. The bearings are shot. It makes a tremendous noise at start up. I have to firmly tap on the brake to get it to stop. I bought the jet because of there reputation. All my other tools are Jet and love them.
2,Arrived damaged,"Ordered despite the warnings about the inadequate packaging. When the sander arrived, I was quite hopeful that this on had escaped damage as the box was in reasonable condition, with only the wear you would expect from such a hefty package. No such luck. When the bx was opened and I inspected the sander, one of the bottom cast-iron feet was broken, and the missing piece was nowhere to be found. I will be obtaining a replacement locally, naturally at a higher price."
5,My New Minnetonka's,Minnetonka Moccasins have been a favorite of mine for many years. Once again I was very pleased with my purchase of a moccasin replacement for my old trustee pair.
3,They run much too small,"I ordered a whole size larger than I wear and these are much too tight for my feet. They are not only narrow but they also are small in length. I am returning them. I wish they would have fit, they are made well and look very nice."
2,Too WIDE,"Minnetonka Moccasins that have this type of sole are too wide. The sole with the little nubs on the bottom are a better fit if you have a more slender foot. I love the look of these, but cannot keep my feet from falling out of them."
5,Birthday gift,The brand speaks for itself. These are a well made and great fitting product. A great slip on & comfy moc
1,Minnetonka Thunderbird Mocassins,"Received the mocs in timely manner, however they were poorly fitted. They were huge, at least a size too large and the width would've accommodated a very FAT, WIDE foot. Was so disappointed. Have had these mocs. before and they fit wonderfully. Not the case this time. Sorry"
2,Very disappointed!,"The stitches on my left shoe fell apart, and I now have a ""joker's mouth"" on my shoe front. I am very disappointed!Anyone knows how to repair the shoe? It sounds silly, but i really want to get my money's worth.........."
3,Great job but frequent belt replacement - early death for Power Paw,"I love the job that this vacuum does, however I have gone through 3 belts in less than a year. I do have to cut dog hair out of the brushes regularly but I have a 150# Newfie so that is to be expected. Since I have carpeted stairs, I thought the Power Paw was a great idea. It worked like a charm --- for two steps!!!! --- then it died. It will no longer spin. Complete disassembly and cleaning of the Power Paw did not revive it. Frequent belt replacement and a Power Paw that was dead shortly after arrival mean three stars instead of five."
2,Worked well... For a couple months,Title says it all. This vacuum worked really well for a couple months but eventually couldn't stand up to arizona heat and dust. I would recommend for a light-use vacuum.
2,Not for a house with dog hair,"Suction was good (not great) but dirt container had to be emptied frequently to keep up the suction. Vacuum was very heavy and bulky, the dust wand never spinned properly, the air suction hose kept coming out of the tube it has to be in to work. But the biggest problem was the rotating beader bar broke twice in the 8 months I had the vacuum - despite frequent cleaning and removal of hairs wrapped around it. I had it repaired the first time but when it broke 6 weeks later again I gave up and bought a new vacuum."
2,Lost in the 70's,"The Eurovision song contest has come up with some good songs, but few are here. The song everyone knows ""Waterloo"" is on this album. I would say about 80% of the songs are from 1970's era. If you like that 1970's folk sound then you might like this album. The album does come with the list of countries the song comes from and how they ranked in the competition. There are a couple of winners in the bunch. My advice if you do not like the forienge folksy type of music then try another album."
5,"Lightweight, but powerful","I love this box! It is very lightweight and does not feel substantial--but after all it's just a circuit board in a plastic housing. However I'm very pleased with its performance. I shoot and edit video almost full time. I have run my HD camcorder directly into this box for capture and so far have 0 lost frames. I use Adobe Premiere Pro (not elements) and Premiere recognized the capture device right away. I have connected a VCR to the box for capture from VHS tapes and it works great. There's a control for digital vs analog captures, so I imagine hooking up a DVD player for capture would work, but I have not tested that yet. Inputs on the box are 1394, composite and S-video. Output interfaces are composite, AND component, 1394 and S-video. Very satisfied!"
4,Good Resource for CA 4th Grade Mission Projects,"I purchased this booklet as my daughter prepared her report on the mission. It's got some helpful information, and the price is right."
3,"A decent softcore movie, but easily could have been better.","Krista Allen is indeed a knockout, and you do get to see a decent amount of her in this movie. Most of the other actresses are very attractive as well. All of them did really well with their orgasms. There were about three good sex scenes. The rest were just okay.This movie could have been something really memorable though. All the sex scenes needed to be longer and filmed better (I HATE that ""merry-go-round"" technique). There were several times where Krista should have been completely nude, but she's partially clothed. The dialogue and plot were really, really bad, and much less time should have been wasted on them. Oh, and the opening theme is without a doubt the most laughably bad song I have ever heard in my life."
3,Emmanuelle in Space Collection DVD Review,In case you are wondering they fixed the first disk (First Contact) to be the real deal (unrated) in the set. all others are similar to disk 2 which has been out for a while as a single. Not quite as good as the Eros Collections from Playboy but entertaining.
3,The Movie was So-So,"I had earlier bought Emmanuelle: first Contact, expecting a movie with Krista Allen, but I was sorely disappointed. The DVD, however, was great. Krista Allen plays a large part in the movie, and though the story is weak at times, the great scenes more than make up for the downfalls. If you are looking for a great Emmanuelle movie, this is it."
3,It's all about Krista Allen,"Title says it all, if you are a fan of Krista Allen, then these are a must have."
4,Not Quite,Great Bass for the price ....but beware this bass does not come with black hardware as stated in the descriptionI got stuck with chrome ...not worth sending back....but may complain to amazon.
4,Meticulous translator of Aristotle,"I've not read Sachs's translation of the Metaphysics, though I did work through his version of the Physics during a summer at St. John's College (where he teaches). His Metaphysics was circulating as a xerox copy at the college bookstore; I'm glad to see it in print.Anyone unfortunate enough (as I am) to read Aristotle in English rather than ancient Greek, can benefit from Sachs's translations, though it remains worthwhile to have something like the classic Oxford translation alongside, to compare their senses of the Greek text. Sachs's object is to recover what Aristotle may've been up to, by avoiding the Latinate terminology that haunts Aristotle studies and trying to find more ""authentic"" meanings for the Greek words. Whatever his ultimate success or failure, it's wonderful to have such a fresh approach to the translation of Aristotle available."
5,so awesome,"Colors is a really really pretty song ! It's so great, trust me. Hikki sings it perfectly. The music is so soothing ish and kind of eerie. It gets stuck in your head too. The chorus i mean. Then wow the lyrics are really meaningful. It tells about like a girl who went thru a change and she's really happy about it so she tells her guy friend about her change and he tries to paint what she says but in the end he ends up painting unhappy pictures. It turns out the girls changed so much the guy doesnt recognize her. AWWWW. This song is so awesome.And everyone knowns SIMPLE AND CLEAN. I bet whenever the KH commercial came on, everyone started singing along. Haha, my little 4 year old cousin did! See how catchy Hikki's songs are?!!? Lol. Anyways, this song is really awesome!!!!!!!!I highly recommend it. Hikki's voice is just so beautiful and this song is just so beautiful. Sigh. Hikki's music just plain rocks........"
4,go Hikki =),"Nice new single from Utada-san. Not her best ever, but very listenable (I especially liked the background instrumentalization). I was ALSO really pleased to see the Kingdom Hearts (U.S. release) track ""Simple & Clean"" included, along with its full-length remix, which I've grown to consider on par with its original Japanese version ""Hikari"" (after I overcame my initial prejudice that is ^^)."
3,Colors- A Remake,"This CD is a re-make of the song ""Hikari"" from her album ""Deep River."" ""Colors"" is the Japnese version and ""Simple and Clean"" is the English version. I like the other songs from her Deep River CD better than this one but since it's Utada, I bought it because it's worth listening. Hikki has a great voice no matter what she sings."
5,A good read,"My father asked me to read this. I resisted at first, I am glad he asked me to. A great story that leads to an even greater message."
1,The Great Stone Face,The book was in SHORTHAND! It was to be a gift for a very special person (who does not read shorthand)! What a disappointment.
1,The book could have been better.,"This book was unable to hold my interest. I thought the book was boring. This book had a good plot. The reason I was not to fond of the ""The Great Stone Face"" was because there wasn't much action. If you like action don't read this book, but if you like stories set in the Early American times or legends this book would be great for you. This book would be good for kids in sixth through tenth grade. I think the author did a good job on the ""The Great Stone Face"" and I would probably read another one of his books."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"I ordered the dust collector and had only a small snafu with the delivery -- the web site indicated that it shipped UPS, but it actually comes by freight (read: you need to stay home and get it off the truck yourself).The collector itself is just terrific. Had some small problems with dust leaks around the bottom of the cannister (I'd recommend running a bunch of redwood through it -- makes it easy to find the leaks!).I'm running it with quite a bit of dust collection pipe and hose, and despite the distance, it's been able to suck up everything I've thrown at it. Ran almost a thousand linear feet of cedar through my planer last weekend (yielding over 100 gallons of shavings!) and the collector didn't even blink. As with any dust collector, I'd highly recommend a separator to go with it.I'd buy one again. Highly recommended."
3,dump the plastic bag!,The v-weave filters clog way to easily with a plastic bag on the bottom. The collected dust spins and migrates into the upper portion and cakes into the filter's many crevices. Use a cloth bottom bag and the problem is minimized. The only reason the manufacturers are putting plastic bags on at all is because it's cheaper and some suckers replace the bags each time they dump them... as if that makes the process of changing bags any cleaner!
5,Very Good,"It's always amazing to me when I find out about a new performer and they turn out to be awesome, and you hardly ever hear their music on the radio. I discovered Govi, and Jesse Cook both by accident and I love their music, well the same thing happend with this CD. It's excellent."
2,"Strong mood, but lacking substance","The ambiance of this album is pleasant, but the rest falls short. Mishra's attempt to fuse classical, eastern, and new age styles leaves the effort somewhat directionless and not a strong example of either genre. The collaboration with Jerry Garcia was another legitimate attempt to cross-market, but Garcia's contribution is minimal and very weak compared to his other work. There are a couple stong songs here, but most lean to heavily on Garcia's namesake or just lack emotional and compositional substance."
4,"incredible music, but not jerry's best","This is a great gateway album to indian music. A few of the tracks are absolutely mindblowing compositions that take you on a journey winding through time and space. However, Jerry Garcia's additions are the weakest part of the album. He plays electric guitar, sits in the background playing long notes while sanjay noodles endlessly. Makes Jerry look bad. This album is worth it by all means if nothing else, just for the song ""Julia"", which flies sky high with electrical energy that makes the body shake, the eyes roll back in the head..."
3,Sanjay Mishra - Blue Incantation,"Work like this often gets shelved within the New Age or Meditative genres, where it usually sits lost in time and space, when in reality it should be brought into the light ... at least the light of the moon, because there's some fine and gifted guitar work here that's unavoidable from the first listen. Sanjay Mishra's Indian guitar style was so compelling that his work was released through The Grateful Dead's merchandising production company, with Jerry Garcia making one of his last recordings right here, where his distinctive hand adds balance and light to four of the tracks found on Blue Incantation. This is a very expansive release, filled with hypnotic evolving atmospheric planes, yet maintains a totally Western classic guitar feel, where Indian musical traditions come face to face with modern conceptual ideals, and flawlessly flow from your speakers with passion and grace.Review by Jenell Kesler"
5,Outstanding collaboration between Garcia and Mishra,"Brilliant guitarwork by two great masters. A lush tapestry of melodic form, this collaboration of Garcia and Mishra produces electrifying results with fluid exchanges of point-counterpoint that can only help but inspire. Mishra's solo tracks showcase his virtuosity and ease in blending Western and Eastern influences into a cohesive and memorable whole. From the lucid ""My Meditation"" and the danceable ""Allegro"" to the hauntingly beautiful ""For Julia,"" Mishra never fails to capture the listener with multiple layers of feeling and emotions. Don't miss ""Passage Into Dawn,"" an extended journey deep into the impenetrable ever-shifting sands of the Rajastani desert."
4,good...,"I don't know what the ""not enough recipes"" is about...There are quite a good amount especially for the price. My complaint is only in the organization- the recipe categorization doesn't flow right and things don't seem to be in the right category. However the photos are excellent-something that works far better than some where you get a verbal description-which if it's a new thing you wish to try you don't know if you want to try it or if you got it right. I haven't tried the recipes yet-however-they read correctly-I hate when people rate about how something wasn't 100% correct-people have different taste experiences and palettes and different methods...you can always adjust stuff.."
4,Great book!!,"This book is a very good help and had very good ideas. Surprisingly varied!! essential for Crepes, waffles and Pancakes lovers!!"
2,"nice picture, not enough substance",This was a disappointing purchase. I thought it would have waaaay more recipes than it did. I'm now looking for a different reference book for this category of recipes.
1,"OH MY GOD, WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!","Seriously, this is 3 times what you would pay at ANY store. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
3,Mixed bag,"Just for reference: I'm no expert and this is only my second experience with digital recorders.I have mixed feelings about the Sony ICDSX46VTP. I've been testing it out for a couple of weeks.The folders, recording, controls and software are all very good. But, I have these issues with this unit:The reviews about it picking up your touch thru the mic are not exaggerated. I was surprised (shouldn't have been) by this major disapointment. It would probably be impossible to capture an interview with any quality while holding this unit.The display is too dark to control it very well in dim situations.If I had to do it again, I'd try a different product."
2,Not as advertised,"This product was advertised to be able to take to a conference, meeting and be able to record the speaker. I can not record anything unless my mouth is right up against the mic. Piece of crap and I paid over a hundred dollars. I sure feel like a sucker. I could have purchased a cheap recorder and got better results. Too much background noise, even when there was no other noise in the room. Good only as a personal microphone."
1,Sony- stick you at every opportunity- ZERO Stars,"I paid $250 for a voice recorder and couldn't find the CD when I replaced my laptop. You'd think Sony would offer a download or replacement through support- but NO. You have to BUY the software all over again. The $250 recorder is now useless because of their proprietary format, but I'll be darned if they are getting another penny of my money, and they shouldn't get a penny of yours."
4,Comprehensive Analysis,"The author can be forgiven for writing a book that reads a little more like a formal academic paper, given his illustrious credentials. However, it is a surprisingly comfortable read given the complexity of the industry (if you could call it one industry) and the material covered. His analysis is as comprehensive as it is thought provoking. He does an excellent job of portraying the myriad of complex relationships between various evermore technologically sophisticated players within the health value chain. I would have preferred more coverage and discussion of specific company/organizational profiles. But, his artful and deft handling of the complex subject matter presented in a way that gives the reader many ""aha"" moments makes this book a must-read for anyone serious about the business of healthcare."
5,"Limited Readership, Unlimited Ideas.","This is an ace book that will unfortunately only appeal to those wanting to bring all areas of professional health care into a commercial but patient focused new paradigm.My firm has created a business operating system (all the non clinical stuff) for dentists in Australia - we do everything from the tools to assist them to credibly advise of pharmacy level home care products, to FactSheets on complex services for better and higher levels of compliance to treatment plans, and to achieve all those economies of scale that small businesses can never secure.It is a well structured book and presents a (psudeo Porter)value based way of looking at health care in a readable and logical way.If you want to make a branch of healthcare work and you have the energy to think your way through the issues (and to overcome the existing Luddites), this book will assist you greatly."
3,Almost Famous,"The Aggravated cd Strength and Numbers is well a rounded album. Their not many down falls on this cd. The music is solid ,and the artist are solid as well. It's a different style of music for the group Aggravated but, they seem to have adjusted well to the more hip hop style. The only real big knock on the cd is that to many of the song lag on and on about the same thing. Also some of the tracks seem to lack effort or they sound the same. Overall if your into old hip hop ,and not kill your mom ,dad and everyone else. This is a good pick it's all about lyric's and beats with this Aggravated effort."
3,unfortunately required,"Since the Sanyo Xacti cameras have no lens threads this is required addition for adding a protective or polarizing filter. It may make the front of camera too large for your belt loop case.Works well with Hama 49mm Snap-on Rectangular Plastic Wide Angle Lens Hood with Cap, available from B&HPhoto.;This accessory isn't required for and can't be used with Sanyo wide or tele adapters."
5,Bon Jovi cd,Great value great item was very pleased with my purchase the cd is great. Will do business again. I highly recommend
3,Spreading Her Wings,I am a long time fan of Postino which Cat worked for a number of years. It is inspiring to see her style beyond the Micheal Chiarello's (of Tra Vigne fame / Napa Style) which she took on at Postino. She has created an inspiring cookbook with very good recipes.
3,Some flaws,"This is an engaging book, with some interesting variations on a number of basic dishes. It is limited in its ambition, a niche book. I have enjoyed using it as inspiration for a number of meals. However, one recipe that was appealing was a total failure. Her Olive Oil Cake turned out to be a soggy mess, dumped in its entirety. I suspect the amount of flour called for, 1/2 cup, was wrong. If I were a better baker, I might have caught that, but then I believe in giving a recipe by a distinguished chef a fair try before changing it. This one will be changed. Nevertheless, I really enjoy this book."
5,Cooking with Car Cora,The Cat Cora cook book was nice I have another which I love also.Books were in good shape.
5,To improve your design and creative capabilities,"William Blake - a genius before his time - created powerful words and images. Reading his works, and studying his pictures, will have a positive effect on your ability to design and communicate. Since purchasing this book, I've found increased attention to details, ways to eliminate clutter, a better ability to write succinctly and creative ways of looking at problems. I recommend this book for all readers wishing to improve their communication, design and creative skills. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Five stars for W.Blake, One star for DRM","I. ConsDRM is an annoyance. I couldn't so much as edit the metadata of the file so that it starts with 'W' (as in 'William'). And I prefer reading my e-books on MobiPocket Reader as opposed to the extra-slow Kindle Reader. I also hate the fact that my reading behavior is more trackable in the .azw format.As for the formatting, some of the verses start in the same line as the previous verse, making for some uneven and inaccurate phrasing.Pictures are great, but do not cover as much of the screen as I hoped.II. ProsEach poem has its link in the table of contents. I like how the illuminated plates come first before the actual searchable text.William Blake's poems are awesome."
5,Gift,"He loves it a lot. I have nothing else to say about this except my son in law reall, really really loves the book."
2,A bad intro to Blake - only good for scholars,"I read a poem by this guy entitled ""Auguries of Innocence"" and was blown away.So I get this book, hoping that it would be as good as an R. Crumb art book,like R's Book of Genesis Illustrated. In fact, this book has graphic valuesthat make it hard to read. The editors did an incredibly impressive jobof faithfully reproducing Blake's work (or so I assume, I'm no Blake expert).In that way, it's an amazing success. However, a lot of the poetry is hardlylegible (Blake's handwritten print style is hard for me). If you can read it,fine. It's also all in an appendix in modern typeface, but for some reason theychose a 6-point read-it-with-a-magnifying-glass font. And face it, Blake's workis intended for a time and place that's far removed from our current sensibilities.So you really need side-notes or a guide for it.This book would be a great for a Blake scholar, but no good for a noob."
4,William Blake: The Complete Illuminated Books,"My only comlaint about this book is the choice of copy for some of the poems. Thanks to the Blake Archive, we are able to compare copies of the various poems, and some of them are much more beautiful than the ones included here. Of course, there is only one color copy of Jerusalem, and it alone makes the book worth it."
5,The Complete Graphics of Blake are a Fabulous Find on Amazon.com!,"Peter Ackroyd's biography, Blake, renewed my interest in Blake's graphic work. This collection of Blake's plates turns out to be wonderfully exciting, complete and visually arresting. I am extremely excited by it. The opportunity to read his work as written, painted or etched in his own hand is wonderful. Moreover, I find that the same texts that soon proved ""dry"" when viewed as text alone now come alive when accompanied by the Master's graphic designs.Frankly, I can't wait to share copies with friends. I have already shared it with those couple of friends with an interest in art and poetry."
2,Impossible for older eyes,I'm going to end up donating this book to the donation box because it is too hard to read and the paper has a very toxic chemical smell.
5,Most creative album I've ever heard!,"I am not, and have never been a fan of hip-hop music. This album changed my mind. The theological content is deep, yet illustrated with incredible clarity. I wish I could write as clearly and descriptive as Timothy Brindle rhymes. I put this album in my TOP 3 albums of all-time. That's from someone who is not a hip-hopper. I'm shocked myself.**It should have been 5 stars. I don't know what happened**Only because of grace,--Jeffrey"
5,the best ever.,"This is clearly the best hip hop gospel album ever.I grew up on hard stuff - Krs One, BDP, Public Enemy, Geto Boys, Ice Cube, and i'm a music snob with a good ear. This Brindle is exalting the sanctifying grace and saving grace of Jesus Christ, giving glory to God, the blood of Christ, and the power of the Spirit. It bumps and the doctrine and spirit are right.I listen to it daily, and it sets my mind on this above."
4,When its all said and done....,"This isn't exactly my favorite type of music, but, just like the superb breaking benjamin, trapt MADE me buy this cd because its so great. I first heard the song ""headstrong"" in a preview for Tears of the Sun (which by the way was a big disappointment) and I had to listen to the entire cd, and to my surprise i loved it! The cd starts off as a typical alternative band that is a little heavy and slowly turns into slower songs which they suprisingly put together just perfectly. In this cd there is something for everyone. My favorite song on this cd is ""New Beginning""."
3,HEADSTRONG,"Awesome cd! If you like deftones, disturbed, incubis, staind, you'll love this cd. Headstrong gets you pumped up enough to workout or beat somebody up! But don't! :0)"
4,good for the first half then starts to slack off...,"i bought this CD because it was on sale at wal mart, and decided to pick it up and try it. once i heard headstrong, i was like here we go another hoobastank like band. i heard the first batch of songs, and said this is a pretty good CD, but for some reason, towards the end it started to sound weird. Now, by far this isn't the most original band of all time, but if you can find the CD for a good price somewhere, then go ahead and buy it, or better yet download it and save yourself some money. It is an okay CD but if you're looking for a really good CD check out Hoobastank ""The Reason"" (sounds slightly better than their debut) or some old school Staind like ""Dysfunction"" or ""Break the Cycle"" but since they are older and you're looking for Trapt, you probably have them, but still break them out. Hear some of the songs on this CD though, they are quite good. You will be singing them alot, I guarantee it."
1,How to be a Nu Metal band in five easy steps,"1. Get signed.2. Make sure you have a mispelled band name- to maintain ""street cred"" like ""Trapt"".3. Write a terrible song describing your post teenage angst with lyrics like ""I'm headstrong to take on anyone"" - Whew I'm scared you are so tough man!4. Have half the radio stations on the dial repeat your song every hour.5. Repeat ad infinitum."
1,A quick look at Trapt,"So what do we have here? Hmmm.... it sounds kind of familiar. Oh yeah.... thats because this band sounds exactly like any other alt/nu-metal/rock band to come out into the mainstream in the past several years. The music itself is your typical wafer-thin alt metal..., that appeals only to people who look for nothing more than a catchy chorus in their music. Sorry people, theres more to music than that. Throw in endlessly redundant song structures and lengths typical of anything radio friendly and you have Trapt. (oh yes what a clever name, instead of calling themselves ""Trapped"" they spelt it TRAPT! har har har!)(on another note, ""You have to have some [nerve] to name your first single 'Headstrong'"" is quite possibly the dumbest and funniest thing i have ever read here on amazon.com. literally. wow.... any of you people who consider this the ""greatest cd ever"" don't know a single thing about music.)"
4,THE BEST CD IN A LONG TIME,"ok pplthis is my first time writing a review.. i always read other people's because i think you can really tell how good a cd is, by the popular response. Let me tell you something, i don't think i hated ONE SONG on this cd. It's just GREAT... headstrong.. made of glass.. these walls, i can't even name one best track, because they're all great...just get it"
5,Awesome,"This CD is most likely my favorite CD that I own. Besides the fact that this Band comes from the Town that I live in, Los Gatos CA, I love this group because of the diversity that you will here while listening to this CD. Every song has its own distinctive sound to it. You can get a Hardcore rock sound out of ""Headstrong"" or a soft-acoustic sound out of ""Stories."" I absolutely love this cd and it is the only CD I listen to at Home, or in my car. If you are a fan of Rock, you should get this CD now, because very soon, these guys are gonna be off the charts, and you wont be able to find it anywhere!"
2,Disillusioned by Headstrong,"I first heard about Trapt through the single Headstrong. I thought that their genre of music fell in that area (sorta Sum 41ish). If you are going to base your purchase off that one song, I would advise against it, and listen to clips of the songs. I would agree that they have potential, but to falsely portray the image they do in the song and the video is an insult to their true fans. In my opinion, Headstrong is vastly different from any other track on the album, and should not be made as a basis to purchase it."
2,average...,"Actually 2.5 stars.a forgetable debut album for me,I thought the band had a lot of promise when i heard ""headstrong"" but after buying the album I found them to be just average.""enigma"" & ""new beginning"" are the only 2 other tracks that kinda stand out.maybe there next album will be better because they definately have talent,the problem seems to be appling it.take it or leave it?if i'd the chose again id just buy the single ""headstrong"""
1,Trapt by Trapt,"Trapt is another band who has been trapt by Hollywood, Clear Channel, and the rest of public media. They are light pop garbage that doesn't deserve to be on the market, unless there is some market for bodily wastes that I haven't yet discovered. If I ever do find this market for brown solid torpedo shaped waste products, I will most certainly sell my used copy of Trapt's miniature frisbee on this market and make some money.Headstrong and Echo are the two singles that actually got somewhere: onto top 40 radio. That's a sure sign that the rest of the albums SUCKS just as much. This may be music to the ears of some, and those some are crap to all of me. Trapt is trapped in a loop of a mix of metal ballads(is there such a thing), and acoustic $ex music. Please save your money and buy some quality music."
2,No need to buy this one,"Why? Cause the first song is CONSTANTLY on the radio! Seriously...if you want to hear the song, just put on the radio for 5 minutes and you will certainly hear it. Yea, it has a catchy riff at first, but after hearing it 124984 times, you realize that it really isn't that good. But give them credit where it is due...it is catchy. Outstanding? FAR from it."
1,Save your money and go buy a Tool CD,"TRAPT, STAIND, LINKIN Park, KORN, Limp BIZKIT....any band name that is blatantly misspelled so as to sound COOL and/or creative automatically suck. (Led Zeppelin is exempted from this for obvious reasons). Perhaps the band, or more likely the record company realized the aggregate intelligence of pop music fans is comparable to a brain damaged hippopotomus, so they named the band, and wrote the music accordingly."
4,Trapt amazing alum & amazing live show,"Trapt is one of these new bands that you can listen to enjoy thier music and respect how they are able to please fans of all ages. I mean they have the sound that uplift and stimulate listeners and they appeal to most all age groups of fans. Rare to see a band with so much to offer and can put on an amazing live performance. I really loved thier debut album and being as how they are taking thier time to put thier follow-up album out, i'd expect it to really be amazing. Trapt Rocks!"
1,"Not Exactly a ""Clean"" CD","I gave it 1 star because the band definitely has talent, but calling this a ""clean"" and edited version is kinda stupid. You know exactly what curse word the singer is singing and hardly any part of the curse is taken out."
2,this band is horribly unoriginal,"i decided to try listening to this album to see if it was any better than it's horrific first single. i notice that sometimes happens.not in this case. this entire album belongs on pop radio. not to say that only bad music is on pop radio (most of it's bad, though), but this is typical, run of the mill nu-metal that is WAY too over produced and way too...boring. you've heard this before elsewhere, and done better. and oh my god, lyrical content. the lyrics are your typical ""i have all this pain inside"" (i don't know if he actually says that) type lyrics that you'd expect from this type of band.final verdict: stay away from this, and buy something a little different. take one of the past reviewers advice and buy some radiohead or tool. shoot, korn is more original than this. don't buy this. please."
2,One of the biggest disappointments I have ever heard...,"This album, quite frankly, disgusted me. I had heard the two singles, Headstrong and Still Frame, on the radio, and I found them quite promising. So I bought the CD. The edgy, angst vibe that I heard from those two songs instantly disappeared, and was replaced by mindless crooning and rather poor guitar. None of the songs could measure up to Still Frame. NONE. O sure, there were a couple of decent songs (Made of Glass, Hollowman) but other than that...just steer clear of this one."
1,Horrible,The album is horrble.Trapt are not musicians and they are not out make music.They are business men and they are out to make money.Anyone who listens to the noise Trapt disguises as music do not have a clue what real music sounds like.And therefore you are among the most ignorant.Hope I could be of some assistance.Cheers!
1,All it took was one lame chorus to make these guys big...,"WOW, this band has no redeemable qualities, although you could definitely use their 2 cds as drink coasters, but who wants to pay 15 bucks for that? I hate the fact that major record labels don't care about good quality music, they just can create a band, write their music, and shove it down the naive listeners throat until they go out and buy it, yuck. I think the main thing about this band that annoys me was the fact that this guy I hated at work (total metro sexual lame-o) thought this band was gods given gift to sound. Needless to say we ended up fighting (he said the Misfits and Black Flag sucked, I was really just looking for an excuse to pick a fight) and I sent him home crying in his lame honda civic hatchback. Needless to say we all laughed and had some cold beers after that affair. Anyways, if you're a brainless mainstream listner that buys a cd for one song than forgets about it after a month, this cd is all yours."
4,They aren't as bad as I thought they were......,"I'm being pretty nice giving this cd 4 stars. If I could give it 3.5 stars I probably would. Anyway enough with the rating lets move on to the cd. The production is pretty good (better than most new bands). The songs are well written and the track listing is very good. Although sometimes I have to skip the first song. They are your average alternative rock group. If 3 Doors Down or Puddle of Mudd doesn't ring a bell than this band may seem totally new to you. Stand out songs include ""Made of Glass"", ""These ""Walls"" ""Still Frame"" ""Echo"" and ""The Game"". My personal favorite on this album is ""Stories"". (...)This cd took some time to grow on me (...). It's almost been a year since it came out and its doing pretty well, so either ask for it for christmas or just buy the (...) cd already."
5,Buy it,"Filled with gripping emotion, dripping from every note sung or played Trapt's debut CD surpassed my expectations with its intensity. The album has many moods evident with every new track and an infectious message behind many. ""Headstrong"" is one of those, I dare you to listen to this CD and not find yourself singing along to the well-written lyrics and rocking out to the sometimes intense and sometimes mellow music. This is one of my favorite CD purchases of 2002."
1,I feel Trapt just listening to them,"Would you like to know what is wrong with the music indistry today? Would you?? just hop down to your local record store and pick up the debut album fron the corporate buttered up money hungry wannabe musicain, punk, nu-metal whatever outfit Trapt. I mean seriously i cant hear a song by these guys without wanting to puke. purely unorigional no depth corporate crap. ""Please help me cause im breaking down"" ooohhh goodness what a complex line..i wish i could write lyrics like that.. man how does he come up with this brilliant stuff? seriously people look 5 or 10 or even 2 years down the road. Do you really think these flavors of the week are gonna be anywhere in sight?? i dont think so. And look at their damn videos i mean god!! Is that retard trying to look all sexy for the girls or what? This is not music people.. this is a business with a dressed up group of nobodys. The fact that these morons are making money just pisses me off."
1,HAHA,I have taken sh*ts that stink less than this band. Damn Mainstream Nu-Metal suckiness... There's really not much more to say about this album.
1,Crapstrong,"This is the worst band in the world, I don't know why I'm even wasting my time on this review. I wish they were ""trapt"" in their practice space and stayed there till they realized that they wrote the worst record and apologized to the world for it. Keep your bad music to yourselves DUDES!!!"
3,I agree with James Cox,"i do agree there are so many bad bands out there like trust co, linkin park and pretty much any nu-metal band.. i do think trapt are a LITTLE different from the other bands. i think u should download the songs like i did. buy real music like Misfits and if u consider Trapt a metal band you are wrong real meatal is In flames, Pantera, Superjoint ritual, Danzig, Poison The Well and other bands,... MAY nU MeTAl die soon........... TURN OFF YOUR RADIO AND MTV DONT LET THEM BRAINWASH YOU INTO LIKING WHAT THEY ARE PROMOTING~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Another Cookie Cutter Nu-Metal Act,"Like their nu-metal brethren in Linkin Park and Trust Co., every song sounds contrived and over-produced. Each track was obviously written for radio airplay; lacking any creativity and real musicianship whatsoever. False anger and generic detuned guitar riffs permeate through an all too familiar alt. metal landscape; talent and skill being sacrificed to gain a quick 15 minutes of fame before being pushed into the ever-growing pile of nu-metal clones. Staying power is what separates the good bands from the weak. Will anyone know who these guys are two years from now? My bet is no."

1,Wow,"Wow, this CD really is terrible. I heard bad reviews about it, but I didn't understand what everyone was bashing it for. Now I know. It's just horrible, horrible music and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone ever."
3,A decent CD,"What can I say, this is just an average cd. This cd has some good songs and some songs I would consider filler. Trapt is not this great new band that everyone seems to think they are. But that is not to say that this cd doesn't have its moments. Still Frame is a very good song, but the cd really drags towards the end. Lyrically there is no depth and the cd. The guitar riffs are almost predictable and not nearly complex enough to keep me interested. Although this cd boasts tons of aggression, it seems that the lack of emotion kills it. There are plenty of better bands out there that deserve the attention Trapt is getting. Rather than buy this cd I would recomment bands such as Glassjaw or Thrice. Two very hardcore bands that will blow you away."
2,OK CD,"I bought this cd because i listened to a few of the songs and liked it. I cant say as much for the cd. i listened to it and got bored. i mean i love the song headstrong and their other singles like echo and still frame but i think theyre so overplayed. im not saying that this isnt a good cd, i just got sick of hearing these songs so much. (and i really dont listen to the radio a whole lot, maybe three or four songs a day and its always the same ones)"
2,lackluster slow paced boring,Listening to this CD i keep thinking of Linkin park with less screaming. This CD is incredibly slow paced and hard to get into i have heard better music elsewhere
4,Fairly Good Nu-Rock Band,"I bought this CD a while ago. The most the songs are pretty good, especially Stories, Echo, and Headstrong. The enhanced material isn't all that good in my opinion. Its live stuff and Chris Brown doesn't really sing that well live be totally honest. Overall, good CD, good band. Heard better, though."
3,Sorry guys,"i'm sorry guys, i can't give'em 5 stars.they are a good band, they guys voice is okbut the only rock songs on here are ""headstrong"" and possibly""still frame"".the rest are almost like a matchbox 20/ verve pipe mixwhich isn't bad by any means, it just makes the album sag alittle bitand alot of the metal kids'll get turned off aboutand alot of the more radio accessible kids that'd like ""hollow man"" or ""made of glass"" will get turned of by the songs on radio and won't buy the cd. over all the cd deserves a 5 star rating but i can only give it a 3."
2,Nothing really all that new,"First, ill make it clear: I have nothing against Trapt or their genre. I will rock out when I hear their songs on the radio, but I have to say that Trapt is in my opinion, a band that is all singles. I picked up this CD because I though that maybe they would have the courage to break the mold...Not so.Three singles, the rest is crap.Nothing more to say.If you want something that can define itself, check out Tool, A Perfect Circle, Slipknot, Korn, Disturbed, Linkin Park, Evanescence, 311, Sublime, Nirvana, Marylin Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Incubus, or even Creed.If you wan to remain in the grey dreary crowd, buy this.I'm selling mine."
5,great cd,"This trapt cd is awsome. I like every song on the cd.My top 5 are Headstrong, These Walls, When all is said and done, Echo, and Still Frame."
3,4th Generation Incubus Clones....,"First there was Incubus. Followed by Hoobastank, who was a little better than Incubus but not grfeat. Then came Audiovent, an AMAZING band that features to mini Incubus Brothers, def worth checking out. And now, Trapt. I heard some of Trapt's demo material almost a year ago. I thought it was great, with awesome songs like ""headstrong"",""hollow man"",""made of glass"", and ""still frame"". I had high hopes for this cd when it finally came out about 7 months after the demo, and I was somewhat disappointed. Everything on this cd is listenable, but the only really GOOD songs are the afforementioned demos. Hollow Man, in particular, is AMAZING. The band will grow and hopefully get better, but this cd is downright decent."
5,pretty dang good cd!,"like every song on the cd especially headstrong, echo, and stories. The way they sing reminds me of sevendust. They can sing softly but also sing hard stuff. awesome new band. if you can download music, try ""i will get what is mine"" and another new band ive heard is Maroon 5 ""harder to breathe"" is a good one."
4,Good Hard Rock,"I bought this CD and so far love it. While the song ""Headstrong"" became way too commercialized a while ago, the rest of this CD is worth listening to. Songs such as ""Still Frame"" give this band an edgy rock sound. I would recommend ""Trapt"" to anyone."
2,alot of room for inprovement,"they have a few strong points, but all of the songs sound the same, like they were wrote to be radio friendly and that sucks. If you buy this cd, i would buy a used one or don't pay over 12 bucks for it, it is just not worth it. i would recommend ""40 Below Summer"" or ""Cold"" over Trapt anyday!"
3,ONE GOOD SONG!,"Just like the title here. If you think the first song is really great, you're right. BUT it goes downhill after that. CD's like this are the reason internet downloading of music became so popular. I like the first song, I only wish I didn't have to pay $10 for ONE SONG. I like things a little heavier, so I'm sure there are some people who will like the rest of this. But MAKE SURE you check it out if you can BEFORE you buy it. I bought the cd ""From One"" by ""Ra"" after buying Trapt, and Ra was a hundred times better."
4,Band will get better with time,Definitely one of the better new bands out there. This CD holds up from beginning to end ! Trapt seems to be a band ..( if they don't mysteriously fade away ) that will get even better with time. I had the opportunity to see them live just recently with some friends and everyone agreed they are good . A must for the collection !
5,Very Good CD Trapt rocks,This cd is awsome I highly suggest it. I give it two thumbs up. I saw these guys live and they sound even better live.
4,Hot!,"Keep it simple, is what im all about, I think for most young rock fans these guys do just that. Great 80's sounds with a touch of the new stuff. These guys realy get what im looking for. One of those albums that you can just play the whole thing start to finish."
5,Worth All The Money I Spent On It,"I love this cd!! Trapt is a very talented band considering that they only consist of 4 great members. My favorite songs are ""Headstrong"", ""Still Frame"", ""Echo"", ""When All Is Said and Done"", and ""Stories"". I got this cd a year after it came out, but all of their songs are still hits being played on the radio today. I wish I could see these guys in concert. They developed my taste in music. This is a cd I would be proud to keep for years to come."
5,Impossible!,"These guys are a PERFECT mix of rap,metal and emo so I was just blown away with some of this effort put into creating this record. They should be on NBUSA(Nuclear Blast USA) records! If you are a fan of Xero(old old old Linkin Park) or Stone Sour you will probably like this record so get this record!"
1,"dont listen to : J. Mortensen ""dustin-duster ""","This guy has no idea what he is talking about. My cousin told me about this band and said it's the best cd to listen to when your pissed off and the best music he's ever heard. So I gave it a listen...huu? um?... maybe this was the wrong cd...i took it out and...no it was TRAPT alright. This is some of the most un original mtv bullcrap I ever heard. The singer sounds like crap and the guitars and drumming are to that of a 12 year old. And don't listen to ""J. Mortensen dustin-duster "" this guy no's nothing about the music he listens to. He calls Greenday punk and Flaw metal. Greenday is pop and flaw is nu metal,and realy crappy nu metal at that!"
1,Trapt!,"Great Cd, includes headstrong, still frame, and echo. Concert in Peoria April 14, 2004. I would also reccoment Staind, 14 shades Of Gray"
1,Headstrong Boring and Long,Trapt are one of the many NU-METAL bands that represent everything that is wrong with Rock music today.Don't buy this crap!
3,"""TRAPT"" or Trapped??","On their debut CD, the cover has a picture of a man who is apparently ""Trapt"" in his 1950s suburban life mowing his lawn. Ironically, ""Trapt"" also seem trapped in the the same predicament of sounding much like many of the other over-played rock bands on the radio today. Grant it these guys have talent, the singer has a great voice and the band certainly has the chops to play with the best of them, but their manufactured sound just undermines their talent. Overall, a good band with ok music that have the potential to be more then just another ""radio band""."
1,TRAPT R POSERS,"All I Can Say Is That Trapt Sucks, Their posers, and TheySound Like Limp Bizkit. They Have No True Message. If You Like Trapt You Need To Start Listening To Real Music. Like Tool, Rage, System, Otep"
1,Trapt in unoriginality,"Take Papa Roach, Incubus, Hoobash*t, put it in a blender, and you have Trapt. The album must really stink because the only song they've played on the radio for the last 6 months is ""Headstrong"". No? Then where's the next quality single?Finally, ""Headstrong"" is being used for ESPN PROMOS! Any semblance of artistic credibility has been utterly destroyed.In 10 years Trapt will be gone and forgotten just like Candlebox, Stabbing Westward, etc."
1,I can't take it anymore,"I think I'll just repeat what every reviewer giving this album 1 or 2 stars has said.....I mean, if bands like Trapt are allowed to do it, why can't I? There are absolutely ZERO redeming qualities on this CD. They are as stalemate as Smile Empty Soul, Three Days Grace, and Static-X. Their lyrics are all cliche (""Please help me, cause I'm breaking down""....wow...no radio rock band has ever used the work 'break'; that must make Trapt just the coolest ever!!! Of course I'm being sarcastic you stupid f@#k!; Linkin Park practically worshiped that word!). Ok, I'm exhausted from all this typing....I wonder if I can sell my used review for money? ....Well, I guess not. After all, I need to have a bunch of teen worshipers of sh***y pop-rock revere me, now don't I?"
4,Great CD,"This is an amazing CD by an amazing group. Trapt's self-titled album completely amazed me from the beginning to end. I think i only pressed skip once on this CD and that was when i was ready to start it over again. I only gave it 4 stars however because anytime you pop it into your CD-ROM drive on the computer, the enhanced CD feature always starts up and it takes forever to get rid of it (this is only a problem because i listen to most of my music on the computer when i'm at home) but since i rarely buy CDs anymore, when i saw this, something told me to get it. And i'm glad it did. Go get it now if you haven't already, and if you did, go get some more and hand them out!"
3,Major label debut from all-or-nothing Californian rockers,"Were a visiting alien to land on your roof intent on discovering where rock was heading in 2003, you could probably satisfy its curiosity with Trapt. Twists of post-hardcore jazz up straight metal sensibilities, the whole thing still staying shiny enough for mainstream radio acceptance. Trapt, to their credit, have always sounded like this (they've already self-released two albums) and have actually walked away from major labels that wanted to change them.Take Finch or The Used, blunt their more abrasive edge, and you'll know Trapt already. First single and US radio hit ""Headstrong"" is the perfect shot across the bowls, all jabbing melodies and urgent riffs, and hits-in-waiting like ""These Walls"" and the mountainous ""Enigma"" are similarly fine. Sadly, several tracks do sound thrown together by comparison, rendering ""Trapt"" a promising, if imperfect, introduction to planet metal."
5,Its been a pleasure.,"I really wanted this CD when they promised and that's when I got it. I received e-mails letting me know when my purchase would come and they followed up when I received it thanking me for my business. It was a pleasure doing business with them.Best Regards,Jewelie Gabriel"
3,Very 80's Pop,"i bought this because it was described by other reviewers as rock pop and soul...however it's more 80's pop, some prince ...isms.. in there...i still love Chaka but it's light on the Rock..."
2,The Woman Who Would Be Queen?,"Powerful Michael HAssan was not borth to the throne, but circumstances had made him king. And as ruler of his desert kingdom, he must marry a wife hand picked for him. Then he met a blond American beauty, and he had to choose between duty and desire...Jen O'Hara had come to Michael's country on a mission - but it wasn't marriage. No matter how hard she resisted, she was drawn to the potent, passionate man whose sense of honor only made him more irresistible...and all the more forbidden. It was clear Michael wanted her - body and soul - but being this sheik's mistress would never be enough..."
3,Bummed,Poltergeist is my favourite Spielberg movie!!! So i was excited to hear that a Special Edition anniversary DVD was coming out!! Then i read that it wasnt really gonna have anything new on it...no out takes or deleted scenes or anything!!??? I dont understand why this movie has always been shoved aside by Spielberg...it is never mentioned by him in interviews....i am just bummed because i was waiting for years for something great to come out and..still nothing! But i will go to the theatre and see it on the big screen again!!!
3,Okay...maybe 3 and a half stars.,"POLTERGEIST is a decent film (I guess), worth seeing for its performances, special effects, and cinematography. It works better as a sci-fi movie than a ghost story. The most disturbing scenes hadn't any special effects, or really didn't need them. The screenplay is highly overpraised (probably because co-producer Steven Speilberg contributed to it). He and the other writers tried to make this suitable for children by adding sappy dialogue but then show us skin dripping off of someone's face. Most importantly, the climactic exorcism sequence (also too gory for its own good) was only three-quarters of the way through the movie. Screenplays need structure! In the ghost movie genre, I recommend THE INNOCENTS (1961). Don't make the same mistake I did and rent (even worse: buy)this mediocre movie"
1,It knows what scares you: NO EXTRAS!,"It's funny, I had just dug up my soundtrack CD of this the other day and was listening to it, and wondering when we were going to get the special edition that's been talked about for years. And years. And years. I think we've been all wanting to see the legendary deleted scenes; God knows if those still exist or have been rotting away in film cans. Warners is usually so great at their releases: why even BOTHER with this? More double dipping to come? Who cares about a documentary about ""real"" poltergeists, unless it's just one of many supplements? Hate to be negative, but this is the biggest disappointment since the dismal Todd-AO transfer on the latest ""Oklahoma"" DVD."
1,GREAT movie! LAME dvd!,Congratulations Warner! You guys really know how to do a special 25th edition right! Even when this ends up in the $6.00 bin at Walmart...I still WON'T be buying this.
3,Wait for bargain bin price,"Nice picture and sound but a disappointment as an anniversary re-release. Wait until it's $5 or re-re-released as a proper special edition, then pick it up."
4,Classic,"Poltergeist was a good movie. I really enjoyed the speical effects in this film. I really enjoyed the part where the mom is in the pool looking for her daughter and all the skeltons pop up. I thought the last 30 minutes of the movie were nonstop excitement.On a side note, the TV show Family Guy spoofed this movie. It was really well done and very funny."
3,Frightening Spielberg production,"MY RATING- 6.9It's quite a frightening mov directed by Tobe Hoper and co produced by Spielberg, thing that is visible with atempts to scare all of us.This time Spielberg challenge us with a house that has a lot of paranormal disturbances. The victims are JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson and his kids, specially the little daughter who is capturated by the ghosts.We get really scared with some scenes in the kids' room with the alive tree attacking. We even get a pause when the ghostbusters leaded by Beatrice Straight and a midget woman appear.The final attack is particularly frightening, with all that difficulties of getting out of the house, but it can't get out of my mind the time the midget said ""This house is clean"". Too early to say that, I think--One thing that also confuded me was JoBeth Williams being so young and having already a 17 year old daughter!Overall, a nice spooky flick, but not the best of the genre."
5,5-stars for the new transfer and superior audio quality,"I suspect a large majority of the people on here complaining about the lack of film related extras on this new DVD haven't actually viewed the restored film itself.Yes, it is absolutely ridiculous that Warner couldn't have put more effort into the extras, and the extras on this disc are incredibly pointless. The picture and audio quality on the disc however is AMAZING, vastly superior to the original disc. I have done extensive comparisons and the first thing I checked was the neighborhood title sequence, which was riddled with dirt on the original DVD. Not so on this new disc! They are lovely and clean. The same goes for the edge enhancement and grain, which plagued the original disc. The contrast, black levels and color definition have also been greatly improved.The extras are not worth wasting your time on, but for anybody wanting this film looking and sounding the best it possibly can on standard definition DVD... LOOK NO FURTHER!"
3,Not So Much...,"I love Poltergeist. It has always been a supercreepy movie, which I really happen to enjoy. This new 25th Anniversary edition looks to be great. I wish it had the original theatrical trailer a cast (what's left of them) commentary, the making of that they used to show all the time, but oh well. I still recommend this edtion."
4,Good after all,"This movie is great Family-Fun. It's entertaining but not gory ( nobody dies within the whole movie ). The music is also very haunting and the characters are likeable and natural. I think the only Problem is the visualisation of the mega-supernatural thing coming from the kid's chamber. Somehow, all the magic and atmosphere the movie builds up in the first half is blown away by the somehow silly-looking skull. But it had to be done somehow and it doesn't keep the movie from being good. The tree- and clown attacks are highlights as well as the Parapsychologist's hallucinations with the meat. The film has a really beautiful photography, just check out the scene where the boy is on the tree and sees the storm coming on the horizon. Well done, indeed. The first sequel is also watchable, it actually explains the story better than this one ( In the End I found myself asking ""why all this"" ) but it lacks the suspense of the original. Again, good with a few little weak points."
5,SCARY AS HELL,"This movie creeped me out big time. The enormous skull, living tree, the closet that looks like that monster from the 3rd Star Wars movie (you know, the thing that had tentacles and was really big and... nevermind), and who could forget the part that scared the bejesus out of me when I was 13! The life-sized clown, of course. You can't go through that scene without being the least bit scared. Some of the effects hold up well today, though the face ripping scene, you can see how much fatter it has gotten.Has to be a classic."
5,Love This Movie. Always Have,I was looking around on demand and I saw a comercial about Incidious and thought of Poltergeist. I absolutly love the movie so I came here and broused until I found it. So I bought it and it arrived 5 days after I ordered it. Goodness I think I watched it a billion times if not more. I'm all into the ghosts and poltergeists and stuff so I love this movie. Came to me in perfect condition and I will keep it that way!
2,no special features,"The movie it self is still a classic and I love the book format and packaging but it was a disappointment not to have any special features, behind the scenes and interviews with the actors and director which is common with most DVD'S especially with BLU-RAY. Very disappointing."
3,GOOD!!,"I like Poltergeist, I own the movie. But, I think that ""Poltergeist 3"" is the best of all time!!!!!! They should make a movie called"" Poltergeist 4: There Back.....AGAIN!""I like it when the house folds in on itself!A THRILLER!!"
2,They're Here,"Not even Speilberg and Tobe Hooper (of Texas Chainsaw Massacre fame) can bring this above the level of mediority. Billed as one of the szcariest fright films of the 80s, it hasn't stood the test of time in out and out fear factor. I wouldn't recommend it to anyione but casual horror film fans."
1,Poltergeist - a traversty,"I become thoroughly disillusioned when misty swirls emanated from the TV. This film doesn't just have cheesy effects, it comes across as a parody of what it should have been. The family seemed pretty unconcerned about the unnatural occurrences. If chairs start moving by themselves across a room surely anyone would rush out and try and get professional help. At times I thought this could be a Disney production for kiddies. The acting was pretty lack-lustre. The strongest reactions I had to this film were disbelief that the producers could try to present such silly effects and also I had to laugh at the ineptitude of the acting. Thing is best categorised as a feeble comedy"
5,Alright...This Isn't Rated R,"I'm not here to write a review on Poltergeist, although it was a fantastic film, but just to tell you that this IS NOT rated R. I bought it at a store around here, and it's PG. That's right. PG. Amazon obviously got the rating wrong. I'm wondering if I got a cut version or something. Maybe this is different? Post if you can tell me what happened!"
5,Poltergeist - it's still a classic,I haven't seen this movie since it came out in 1982. Loved it then and it hasn't lost it's touch. Still scared the ____ out of me several times. Love the actors - this is a classic!
5,Great movie.,This movie is great for everyone. It's just as scary as you remember. Also it's a good movie for tweens who want to watch a scary movie. It's suspenseful and exciting without being too gruesome.
4,Ahhhh...fond memories,It looks just a tiny dated today like the Satan head coming out. Classic Spielberg effects. He still uses those same techniques today.
5,A Great Basic DVD Delivered Early,The title says it all. This is a great no-frills DVD of a great movie worth seeing again and again that arrived much earlier than estimated. Buy from Frugal City. My business with them was quite satisfactory.
5,My Favorite Movie!,"I first remember watching this movie when I was about 3 or 4, it came out when I was 1.....but ever since I've seen it, it's been my favorite movie of all time! I've watched it literally thousands of times. I could watch it every day of my life and I would never get sick of it. It's so freaky to put urself in the family's position, and think of what it might be like to be in their situation! It's like no other horror movie. If ur thinking about buying this movie and have never seen it before, don't worrying about getting nothing for ur $$. it's well worth it and I can garuntee u'll love it. There is not 1 person I know that doesn't like this movie. IT'S THE BEST!"
5,Simplicity,"To everyone writing a review...Please know your information before you begin to write. The scene where carol-anne says , ""They're here"" is NOT in the begining. It happens after the earthquake, and she is at the foot of her parents bed. The family's name is the Freelings, not feeling or furlings. And, last but not least, the people who bought their movie from amazon should have gotten off their lazy (explicative)'s and went to best-buy and got it for $9.99."
3,Always Liked This But...,Poltergeist comes from my childhood so it will always be a part of me. It was one of the first films I remember seeing and I will never forget it. To watch it now brings back memories of being a kid and for that it will always have a place in my heart. This film was never that scary to me. For some reason I found it too silly to be scary. Poltergeist is also one of the dumbest movies to be made because there is no way a family would stay in a house AFTER chairs pile up on the table and they hear voices at night. Also who would stay in this house AFTER they got Carol Ann back? That was the straw that broke the camel's back. When I was a child I didn't notice these things but as an adult it makes a once very interesting film seem down right pathetic. I still like this movie it just makes no sense whatsoever.
4,Very good movie,"This movie was one ofthe first ""horror"" movies i ever saw and i have to say that some parts still send shivers up my spine. This is a great movie to watch on dark night by yourself."
4,DVD,Video arrived in tack and no problems just like I ordered. Would reccomend to anyone that asks. Amazon.com is the place to get whar you need.
3,OK FOR AN OLDER MOVIE,"THE MOVIE STORYLINE WAS ORIGINAL. THE SEQUELS WERE NOT AS GOOD AS THIS FIRST ONE. I SUPPOSE HOLLYWOOD CAN'T WAIT TO TRY TO REMAKE THIS ONE AND TOSS A BUNCH OF MODERN SPECIAL EFFECTS INTO IT, YOU JUST WATCH. THIS MOVIE IS OK, IT'S JUST SHOWING IT'S AGE. WONDER WHAT MODERN EFFECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE IN THIS MOVIE. HEY, I GOT IT ON SALE. WHAT CAN YOU SAY?"
1,They're not HEEEEERE!,"Special features, that is. I was really looking forward to this being a 2 disc special edition, so when I saw it was available for pre-order, I got really excvited. Then, I saw that it had only a 2 & a half star revciew. So I thought, ""what the hell?"" This movie is awesome. But, come ON!!!!! Only a documentary on real life poltergeists that I could see on A&E? Maybe for the 30th anniversary they will release the ""real"" special edition."
5,Finally....Special Edition in Oct. 07,Mark the calendar. Special Two Disc set being released Oct. 9th. With a one time theatre run on Oct. 8th!!!!!!
4,"Run to the light, Carol Anne!!","It may be hard to believe, but I still get a chill watching this movie after twenty years. I hope eventually the studio will release a director's cut, or at least a special edition DVD with deleted scenes, documentaries, etcetera. The remastered Dolby 5.1 sound is excellent, but the aging and non-remasterd picture could use some help. Poltergeist incited the Motion Picture Association of America to create a new PG-13 rating."
2,Buyer Beware,"This is one of my favorite movies, and I've reviewed the earlier DVD issue elsewhere. My review this time is purely for the new DVD reissue which is one of the biggest disappointments I've come across. Let's start with this ""25th Anniversary."" The only mention of the anniversary is a haphazardly placed sticker on the outer sleeve. The fact that it was just slapped onto the box gives the buyer an idea of how much thought went into this new DVD.Then there are the extras. A documentary about true-life hauntings. Okay, that's not bad. But wait - where's the original trailer for the film that was on the earlier DVD? It's been removed. Did the trailer get sucked into Carol Anne's closet and is being held captive by the Beast? What purpose did removing the trailer serve?This is a pointless release. My advice is to hang onto the earlier release which is anamorphic AND has the trailer and skip this one; there will be another, hopefully better, release someday. Warner Brothers should be ashamed."
5,Great movie!,"This was a great movie, scary and with an incredible plot. It is very scary, and was originally rated R, but when the movie's crew complained, it was lowered down to PG. Still, I would consider or watch this movie before letting a child under 13 watch this."
5,A Terrific and Chilling Ghost Story,"A classic horror show about things that go bump in the night, Poltergeist promises to scare you: and it does! When Poltergeist first begins, it seems as though it will just be another spooky movie. However, once the first half concludes, the movie shows you one scare after another. The swimming pool scene may make you jump out of your skin! (Literally!) Craig T. Nelson is just fine as the concerned father and JoBeth Williams is stunning as the intrigued mother. However, it is Zelda Rubenstein who steals the show as the zany medium. As an added plus, the phenomenal music sets the perfect mood for the film and the movie ends leaving you feeling very unsettled, just as a good horror movie should. So if you are looking for a well-written, stylish ghost story, Poltergeist is just that. But there is plenty of gore, too. Rent it tonight and enjoy!!!"
3,"Baum's Oz is utterly enchanting, but not the strongest of the series.","Trot and Captain Bill find themselves in the magical land of Oz and Baum's typical, weird and imaginative adventure whisks them to Jinxland, where a cruel King has usurped the throne from the beautiful and kind Princess Gloria, freezing her heart. The Scarecrow joins Trot, Bill, Button Bright, and the gardener boy Pon to save the kingdom. Baum's prose is light and charming, and often profound. Though this is far from the best of his Oz books (Ozma, Road, and Tin Man are my personal favorites), Baum is a treasure of American literature with his ability to infuse the bizarre and ordinary with absolute magic. Grade: B"
1,Brand name does not mean quality,My experience with all Calvin Klein linens is that they are of poor quality. They lose their colour and after a few washes lose their texture.
5,Beautiful,"I've always enjoyed Kurosawa as a filmmaker, but I had never realized that this book existed.To say that this autobiography moved me is an understatement. It is written with great beauty, intellect, wit and humility. Reading the first portion, I had completely forgotten about Kurosawa the director and was enthralled by the story of this boy growing up in Tokyo. His experiences in the disaster of 1929, the death of close kin and his relationship with teachers and mentors is an incredible story that I cannot do justice with in such a short review.Even if you are not as keen on Kurosawa and film, I recommend this book. It is a page turner and I promise you that you will find yourself both laughing and crying by the end."
5,Inspirational,"This work is pure pleasure to read. His use of language mirrors his mastery of cinematography. The book outlines his life up until 1950. While this might seem to omit many of his more well known works, enough detail and thought is given to his early days, that a true insight is gained into his life and work. I do not consider myself a movie buff, but this book doesn't get caught up in the technical side, so I was able to understand his passion clearly. Very good."
4,Use this on my sailboat,"I'm using this on my sailboat with a 30w solar panel to charge two 12v deep cycle batteries for my electric motor, it does an excellent job of silently keeping batteries fully charged without over charging or damaging the batteries."
4,A Beautiful and Realistic Story,I used this book with my 4th grade class to teach them about Alaska Native cultures and geography - and I would recommend it highly. A different reviewer was concerned about a character who suffers from alcoholism... ignore that review. Alcoholism is a serious issue and readers get an honest glimpse of how this character's alcoholism negatively affects the lives of those around him. This is a great book.
1,Inappropriate Reading for Young Readers,I bought this book for my 9 year old granddaughter. Thankfully I decided to read it before I gave it to her. The book has now been disgarded. There are about 5 or 6 references to a adult character who does nothing but drinks or gets drunk when he is in Nome. This is no way to instill moral values in the minds of young readers. The book should be pulled from book shelves.
1,Not Happy w/this Purchase,"I ordered this specifically to be able to reheat coffee in a microwave because I like my coffee hot. Unfortunately the first mug arrived with a crack in the glazing along the base. That crack quickly started to leak hot coffee on the very first use. A replacement mug was sent but it became evident almost immediately that the ceramic mug gets very hot too and does not retain the heat well. The hot liquid cools very quickly as there is no insulation. Also the lid is flimsy and tends to leak coffee while you're trying to sip it. Overall, I am not happy with this product and my search for a wide bottom mug that can be reheated in the microwave continues."
1,Excessive shipping & handling charges,"I haven't received the mug yet, but the shipping & handling fee for this coffee mub was $9.00; nearly half of the cost of the mug itself. Why was it so high? If amazon.com's shipping and handling fees are customarily this high, I will not be using your website any further.Joyce Dean"
2,Not microwave safe,"This is a fine product with one major exception. The mug I received is not microwave safe. I have another HoJo wide-based mug (cobalt blue) from a different vendor and it works fine in the microwave. However, the white mug has a major defect. When you reheat coffee in the microwave, the lower part of the handle gets too hot to even touch. This is not as advertised.Wide Bottom Ceramic Travel Coffee Travel 16 Oz."
1,Very Disappointed!,My mug arrived with several areas of glaze chipped off. I'm not about to send it back though because of the shipping charges. I'd be paying for the mug threefold if I did and probably would find missing glaze on the replacement. I wasted my money. The store that sells this mug via Amazon didn't check the merchandise prior to sending it.The box it arrived in was in a larger box with packing foam. But the inner box that the mug was in was opened and was in bad shape. Not good for Amazon either. I hope the powers that are in Amazon see this review.
5,Just what I was looking for,We had a small family wedding and I was looking for something simple and low-key to play. I used the first 3 songs before the wedding and canon in D for my walk down the aisle. This CD is just what I was looking for.
4,Short review: Ideal for your wedding,"This CD is one of the best for your wedding at day, it's fresh and calm.I'll really invite you to buy it!"
1,Hard Fall,This is one of those albums that every band puts out that they should pretend they never made. This is the Rose Tattoo where they sold out. Much like Metallica's black album this is where they lose fans. Do not buy.
3,try Wikipedia for more information,"Saberhagen died just last year. Quite successful as a science fiction and fantasy writer. This short biography could be omitted, in favour of checking the free information in Wikipedia. There, you can look up Saberhagen directly. Plus, you can also refer to other Wikipedia entries, especially on his Berserker and vampire series."
3,Not as good as the regular Dr.,"The main thing that is an improvement over the ""regular"" Dr. grip is that this has added heft that makes it more comfortable to hold. In addition, the grip is softer, which feels nice but I actually hold a pen pretty tightly when I write so pinching this softer material actually makes writing a little more taxing.If you're thinking about this as a second Dr. Grip, be warned. The two pens are physically different sizes (the Center of Gravity being the smaller of the two) and the ink cartridges are not compatible- big disappointment there. I've since gone back to the trusty original 'Grip. The added weight doesn't make up for the pens other shortcomings."
3,Good pen casing quality,"The pen case itself is nicely balanced in weight, attractive looking, and a bit wider than normal retractable ballpoints. It is comfortable to hold and write with. It is a decent upgrade from disposables for the budget conscious. The performance of the ink cartridge is another story though. While it does write a bit smoother than a disposable, the ink color is not bold enough and inkflow is not very uniform."
3,Ok but I prefer the original Dr. Pilot,"I didn't realize this was a roller ball. I prefer ballpoint pens as I can control it better. In addition, the pen has a heavy bottom which affects how I write so while I think I could possibly get used to it, my overall preference is the original Dr. Pilot."
5,Cool Gift,My son is a HUGE dinosaur fan. I wanted to get him something cool and different for his 8th birthday. This was the perfect gift. It looks exactly like the picture. He loves it!
3,"Muller's plotting is getting tired, but still like her books","Most of the other reviewers have said what needs to be said concerning this book. It's a good read for the beach, yet that in itself is a bit of criticism because most fine authors want to be better than that (I would think). This genre is supposed to be entertaining, and this book is exactly that. No less worthy of spending your time then sitting in front of the boob-tube for hours at a time!It's hard, I'm sure, to continue writing about a single protagonist all the time. And it's difficult to ask readers to suspend belief over certain things happening constantly to one person (though I can testify that bad things do happen constantly to good persons). Not enough effort put into the plot, and newcomers to Muller's books usually get a better introduction into the characters, and so the characters seem rather cardboardish at this point.Karen Sadler"
2,More Like A Walk Through Boredom,"Someone's trying to sabotage the making of a documentary. I thought it might be interesting. I'm sorry, I was wrong. Unfortunately, the book was downright predictable. In some areas, it was just plain contradictory. The characters lacked depth and the plot was extremely weak. When you see this book on the shelf, just keep walking."
3,Not top form-characters are thin/plot aspects nonsensical.,"Being married to an estate planning attorney I was unhappily aware that all aspects of the plot that were tied to wills were nonsensical. It's not unreasonable to simplify a complex subject, but there should be some connection with reality.When Patricia Cornwell had Kay Scarpetta fly on the Concorde, I thought, ah Patricia wants to fly on the Concorde and write it off. I had similar thoughts about this novel - Marcia wants a write-off on a trip to Kauai.However, she does provide a pretty good sense of place. Her characters are rather thin, though; I missed the usual San Francisco crowd. As often happens in this type of novel, the end seems rushed.I've given up on Kay, but I'll stick with Sharon."
2,Unexpected weak effort from Muller,"I'm a fan of Marcia Muller going back many years, but this installment in the Sharon McCone series was a disappointment. Not that all good authors can't stumble occasionally. A Walk Through the Fire was tepid and just plain boring most of the time. It didn't really even seem that Sharon was the same character we've been following for so long. The demands of turning out a top notch mystery year in year out must surely take a toll on any author. But we are all hoping Muller merely slipped a bit on this one and that the next installment will be back on track."
2,Audible vs Ebook...,"This was terrible as an audible book. Speaker was too fast, especially in the beginning. Let us choose between audible or ebook. For the price I paid, I listened to the whole thing. Won't do it again."
2,A let-down,"I have read all of Marcia Muller's books and this one was certainly a let down. During the past 2 weeks I got Listen to the Silence, Both Ends of the Night and this one out of the library. The other 2 were great - I devoured them, but I couldn't get past page 50 of this one. Will return it to the library unfinished today. Thank goodness I am aware of Muller's REAL potential and don't have to judge her by this book."
3,A mediocre read from a great series,"The decision to begin a novel with offensive language on the first page is questionable. I almost did not read past page one! Why risk turning a percentage of readers away with an opening that some readers may not be comfortable with? I continued to read and found the plot fairly tight and the story well-written, and McCone's ever-maturing personality believable. The story is good, but the opening language leaves something to be desired."
1,Thoroughly unexciting.,"I was glad to read that other reviewers considered this book below Marcia Muller's standards. Otherwise, I would be completely unable to understand how she had become a successful wrier.To complete reading this unexciting book required significant self-discipline. I was tempted many times to close the cover and return the book to the library. In retrospect, I wish I had because I could have found much better use of my time."
2,No Power,"The book of Acts is a book of power! Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation. The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story. Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars. Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers. All of that is lost in the DVD presentation.I would not recommend this DVD. Stick to the Book instead."
1,Acts,"I was disappointed to receive the DVD and realize that it was only Part 1. Why would someone sell 1/2 of a movie??? I did not enlarge the picture to see the Part 1 on it. I wish it had been noted in the explanation. So, then I thought, OK i'll just buy part 2, but couldn't find it anywhere and ended up having to buy the whole thing again. So now I have 1/2 a movie that I can't use."
5,Emmanuelle in Space - A Lesson in Love,"Awesome movie! Simply the best! Krista Allen is so sexy and beautiful. If you are a Krista Allen fan, this movie will be an addition to your collection. Recommendation: A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
2,It wasn't for me,"Well, I made it to page 170 and have given up. I don't have the slightest care for any character or any of their concerns. I only read classic novels in general and have been into gothic novels for the past 8 years. To put it mildly, this book did not hold my interest."
3,Not for General Reading,"This book contains a few random interesting pieces, but it's not something you want to pick up and read unless your into pre-1500 history."
2,"Boring sci-fi, with pleasing moments.","This is a sci-fi movie about an unusual team of people hired to go up and investigate an abandoned spaceship. However, as they reveal what happened, they also find out that someone among them is behind all of it. Intriguing? Mildly. Overdone? Probably. The main reason to see this movie is for Jeff Speakman. Jeff Speakman is a Kenpo Karate expert, who has sadly done many bad films in his career. However, if you like to see martial arts action, you may like to see this movie. Toward the end, Jeff gets a fight scene in which he gets to crazy against his opponenet. I think Jeff has some of the fastest hands in the martial arts movie world. I dare say that he is faster than Jackie Chan, and maybe even Jet Li."
4,Great one man leveler,"I picked this up on Ebay at a great price. Unit arrived perfect and worked perfect. I tried the setup procedure and it was out 1/4"" over 100 feet. I adjusted it per Porter Cables instructions and it is dead-on level over 100 feet now. The remote is perfect for a single person to rotate the beam to where they want. Just be aware that this unit does not constantly spin like some do. You rotate it once so the unit will ""find"" level and from there, you rotate the dot until it appears on the spot you desire. The line projection feature (a mirror that bounces the beam into a series of dots) is a little inaccurate so I never use it. It works excellent and is very accurate. I have used it for about 3 or 4 months now and am very pleased. I have rechecked it for level and it is still dead-on. I have done foundation work (a real time saver for that) and a lot of interior work and it works great."
2,Junk but works,"Mine came with all the parts, but the paint chips off with little effort, closer inspection it's clear there's no primer on the metal and the metal is rusted where the paint peeled.The stand seems solid enough, mine doesn't vibrate but I wouldn't be surprised if others had problems. I left every screw super loose until I could mount the sander and level the legs. It was helpful to attach the sander sideways as you'll never be able to do it from the top.I would look for an alternative, something mobile would be nice as now I'd like to move it from where I put it together."
1,NOT ALL PARTS ARE INCLUDED,Seems to be good quality but does not come with any bolts to assemble the stand.
5,"Duck and over, James Bond. Slippery Jim DiGriz is here.","James Bolivar DiGriz (aka Slippery Jim) is one of my altime favorite characters. Set in the future, this tale of a criminal mastermind loose in an artificially pacified universe will not let you put it down. Great wit mixed with masterful writing, as has come to be expected from a legend of Harry Harrison's calibur, leaves you chuckling and invigorated. The great hook in the first paragraph leads into an unforgettable story of suspense, daring, intelligence, and humor. Get a copy today."
4,A bit dated.,"This book, originally published in 1961, shows some signs of its age; it is in a style very reminiscent of the pulps of that era of science fiction, in which character development is minimal and implausible plot devices are not rationalized overly carefully. Still, it's a fun romp based on an interesting concept, and one of the classics of its era, so I can't rate it less than four stars. Great literature it is not, but a fun story it definitely is."
5,Shocker,"This book was referred to me by an old friend, so as a courtsey I picked it up and read it...WOW. It was great, I've always seen myself in a life of crime, and this book really gave me something to identify to. It's a short read, I finished it in a few days so if your considering it, just get it. it's fast, fun, and full of adventure."
4,Nice LCD TV,"Very good LCD. I got rid of my Toshiba Widescreen LCD TV/VCR Combo to get this and I don't regret it at all. I was looking for a similar TV/VCR combo that was standard definition and though this is not a combo TV, I am impressed. The picture looks good even without tuning. But it did take quite a bit more tuning to get it just right. But once there, excellent.It is almost as good as my old tube TV. The colors are sharp and natural looking unlike many LCDs. It has a nice slim design and is very light weight. Super product."
3,"Beautiful illustrations, cute story","This is a hard one...the illustrations are absolutely beautiful, and the story is cute. However, we were less than thrilled with the mother in the book wearing a belly shirt, the grungy look of the father (he looks practically homeless), and the graffiti on the bridge walls. This could have been a favorite, but so disappointed with the grungy, unkept look of the family."
5,The purrfect late night album...,"Lushly arranged standards by the sultry vouced Julie London, both LP's are wonderful, together on one CD, on Nice Girls Don't stay For Breakfast there are some small group jazz sessions that are spectacular, particularly ""I Surrender Dear"" and ""I've Got A Crush On You"" show that Miss London was a jazz singer when she wanted to be. Comes highly recommended."
3,"Love Julie London, but she is sabatoged by poor arrangements","Julie London was blessed with one of the lushest and most seductive voices I've heard. When everything is on target, her version of a song is tops. On this combination of two albums from the 1960's, Ms. London's singing is as warm and enticing as ever. Unfortunately the person or persons providing the backup arrangements did not serve her very well. Altogether there are 3 or 4 songs where everything really clicks. On the rest the background instrumentals sabatoge the spirit and mood of the song. So far my favorite Julie London CD is ""Julie London Sings the Standards."""
4,tale of two recordings: the good and the bad,"The two sessions here show what the recording engineer can do to a voice. End of the World (sic; the actual original title is The Good Life) benefits from the superior engineering provided by Dave Hassinger. Unlike many of her later records, the reverb on Julie's voice is very light and blended with the direct sound. It sounds larger than life but in a delicious way. Also, the background instruments are rendered in a clear and undistorted manner. 4 starsNice Girls Don't Stay for Breakfast on the other hand is sabotaged by some of the worst recording Julie suffered through (courtesy of Sidore and Britz??). Her voice is boxy and plagued with constant sibilant distortion. The reverb is also poorly integrated with her voice although this album is not unique for that unfortunately. The Mickey Mouse March is also a disastrous choice of songs for this album unless Julie meant it as an inside joke on the engineers.1 and a half Stars"
2,Disappointing and ordinary raisins,"I guess I learned from this purchase that raisins are raisins are raisins. I could've bought some in my local grocery store that would have been just as good. Delivery took unconscionably long, too."
3,"Nothing special, same as store bought raisins",Not gourmet. Just typical store bought raisins. Nothing special. Not worth getting on their own. I was purchasing other products from this supplier.
3,Good story but seriously with the vocabulary?,"For starters, I liked this story, at least I liked the premise of this story. My main issue: it felt like an exercise that a teacher would give to write something containing all the vocabulary words that you had learned over the year. I am a fairly well read individual and I had to use the dictionary several times because I had NO idea what the author was talking about.The characters were interesting though I wish they had been fleshed out more. Everyone and everything felt a little...flat.For $0.99 not a bad buy but I wouldn't seek out anything else from this author."
4,Enjoyed the story!,The fast-paced story caught me from the first paragraph. Easy reading with likeable characters. I plan on reading more futuristic romance from Christine Michels.
5,Walking on Sunshine,Walking on Sunshine [Metro Remix]love this mix ! been listening to it for so many days in a row now and i still love it ..
4,"Good song, but where's 50 Cent?","I love this song. Nas is a great rapper and all. The beats are great. I love the original too. But the only problem I have is i cannot find the version with rapper 50 Cent which I like the best. Is there another single featuring him on it? A+ for the song but F for not having the version with 50 cent on it, nor the original."
5,Good song ft NaS,"This single is one of her best because she feat the king of N.Y, NaS the great.This song is in my top 25 best of songz.Contains the video clip of this fuxxin hit!I own the single version and i think this version may have 5 stars!!!Big up to NaS"
2,Not worth buying,"This simply is not worth buying if you already own her remix album. It doesn't have the stunning Alive remixes the other version of this single has or any good remixes of the title track. I love J Lo, but this single is not her best work."
1,"Three Way Tie:Can't Sing,Can't Dance,Can't Act.",This song is just terrible.I would reccomend watching her music videos with the volume on mute.Throw this CD away with the rest of your trash.Peace Out
1,"Muddled, vague and confusing","Author bio says she's a member of the Washington bar. I looked it up at http://www.wsba.org/directory/default.htm and she is NOt a member. The book: poorly written, out-of-date information and generally bad advice. NOT recommended."
3,Computer Work Station,The workstation suits my needs. As the printer starts printing the workstation starts wobbling.
5,Friendship and Keeping a Promise - A fine film,"This film is about how one friend should help another friend who is lost and in pain. In telling us the story of two buddies haunted by Vietnam, ""Jacknife"" shows us how we should treat one another but so seldom do.The film doesn't deal with the rights or wrongs of the war. It deals with helping each other and keeping promises. In the process, three souls are saved.Don't miss this beautifully perfomed film. It will move and inspire you. I regret the film hasn't been put out in DVD format. I hope it will be. It is too important a movie to be forgotten.Get the VHS version if you can't get it on DVD. You don't want to miss this masterful film.P.S. - I wrote this review some time ago, and I'm glad to say the movie has been released in DVD format. So, enjoy this fine film and learn why it is important we keep our promises."
3,Beware...made in China,"I love the design of the cannister set, but nowhere in the reviews did it mention made in China. I think it is too expensive considering the decals etc are not the same quality as my other Villeroy and Boch pieces. Also there was a small chip on one of the lids. Just overall very disappointed that it was not the same quality as I expected!"
5,Recommended reading for students of Comparative Religion,"Ably written J. Donald Walters who, as Swami Kriyananda, founded the Ananda network of spiritual communities, The Promise Of Immortality: The True Teaching Of The Bible And The Bhagavad Gita is an in-depth comparative commentary on parallel passages both in the Bible and in The Bhagavad Gita. Passages on Jesus Christ, the soul's ascent to redemption, and overcoming the flaws of one's own ego in religious study are all discussed in this thought-provoking, heavily researched and deeply spiritual analysis that earned the rank of Finalist in ForeWord Magazine's ""Book of the Year"" award. The Promise Of Immortality is highly recommended reading for students of Comparative Religion, the Bible, and the Bhagavad Gita."
1,Not one of his better CDs,"I admit I haven't bought any of Bukems CDs since Progession Session Vol 5, but I was quite disappointed to find out that this CD is not even Jungle. This CD is more of an ecletic mix of chill out breaks at about 120 BPMs (certainly not the 170 you expect to hear on a jungle CD). This CD is more like jazzy lounge music. It's not a terrible CD, just not at all what I expected."
5,Dealing with the rejection and the praise of man,Bob Sorge is an incredibly gifted writer. He has a testimony that has caused him to draw closer to the Lord. I have read just about every one of his books and each one is better than the next. This book is great if you suffer with desiring praise from man or if you are crushed when you are rejected by man. It is a quick read and very revalatory!
3,Somewhat Interesting,"This book opened my eyes on a few issues that we as people in a carnal world may have. Issues like desiring the praise of others and not being able to accept rejection. The book basically tells you to take focus off of yourself and place if only upon God. I only give this book three stars because there were redundancies and pages that were just uninteresting. However, the main goal of the book is positive and it does give scripture to back it's information up. It's an ok read."
5,A Political History of the Norman Conquest,"This is an excellent book written with great clarity by a non-expert. Although the author only deals with the political aspects of the Norman conquest of the region, he writes in such a way as to make the major characters of this period come alive. He ignores the social and cultural aspects (which are fascinating of themselves), but in his own area he is outstanding as he explains the shifting politics of the region. He argues that the Norman superiority on the battlefield was not just due to their mounted charge but the oft ignored fact that they exhibited great discipline on the battlefield with the ability to make difficult tactical shifts of bodies of knights.The book has very good footnotes, an excellent bibliography, and maps that can even be read on the kindle."
5,very informative with a sense of humor,I enjoy history and facts tempered with humor does it for me. would like to read more historical books written in this manner.
5,Great Product,"We love this new showerhead. Works great, even with low water pressure. I would recommed it to anyone who wants to add height to an existing shower."
3,waterpick chrome flex showerhead,Not wonderful and haven't used it long enough to see if it was worth buying just replace a showerhead that brke into two pieces and we dndn't move it. It is wait and see.
5,very powerful - great buy!!!,could not find in any stores...this is the upgrade version to one I purchased years ago...works even better than the older version....Goodbuy!!!
5,Flexible shower head is great!,I love this product. It is flexible so I can adjust it to aim anywhere in my shower. The flow of water coming through the shower head is optimal. I don't even use up all of my hot water anymore and I still take just as long if not longer in my shower.
1,Mold breeder,"I've used Waterpiks since the late 1980's and this is the worst piece of junk ever.Pros: Mild steady stream of water after removing restrictorTube flexes easilyCons: Stream not as forceful as the original Teledyne WaterpikThe NLS-603 breeds black mold in the nozzles after several months of use, clean with bleach mold returns in a monthNo water massage featureLooks and feels cheapGiven to Goodwill for some poor folk to have.$ave your money and buy an original Teledyne Waterpik that is unless you like to shower with black mold."
4,Flexible showerhead,"I like the showerhead very much. It is easy to position although not real attractive.The various spray adjustments are adequate, but there could be more of them."
4,Waterpik NSL-603 shower head works well but wears out in hard water,"This is my second Waterpik NSL-603 flex showerhead. The first one fell apart after 10 years. I have very hard water and need to soak this shower head in vinegar for 1 day, every year, to remove the mineral build up."
5,...completely missed the point...,"Pedro J. Eustache says:With all respect, I completely disagree with Mr Alec's review. It seems the point of the book is terribly missed. I don't think Mr. Thakar intended this to be just another ""normal counterpoint manual"". Mr. Thakar obviously must know that... instead, this is a practical, yet extremely challenging way to convey paramount concepts on interpretation applied into performance, 'DISGUISED' --so to speak-- AS A COUNTERPOINT METHOD!The importance of this book is not small: to my knowledge it is THE ONLY book exposing, dealing, & explaining interpretational concepts based on a branch of philosophy called phenomenology [& yes, you are right, it might be too advanced for some], championed by the genius orchestral conductor maestro Sergiu Celibidache [Mr. Thakar's teacher].Yes, I do believe you completely missed the point... Ah, & another little detail: Mr. Thakar was born & raised in New York City --ENGLISH IS HIS NATIVE LENGUAGE!"
5,Nice Knife,"My wife is petite and an 8"" chef's knife is too big. This 6"" knife is perfect for her and she loves it. Her sister tried it and bought one for herself.I was tempted to buy one of those German $100 knives, but after trying this one, I do not see why I should. It feels good, looks good, and is sharp as a razor. What more could you want?"
1,Bad laser,"I bought this tool 3 weeks ago, the first one did not work outside (in the sun, temp 82f) for more than 5 to 10 min., Amazon sent me another one, and it did the same thing. I called PC and they said ""they have removed this laser from the market because of this problem"". I am not happy and have returned both, however my job have suffered greatly because of lost time and due to PC not informing Amazon of this. I have informed Amazon of this, I see the produce is still being sold."
2,Does not fit a RX8 2004.,It is too big for my car. Luckily my moms a seamstress and she can alter it but amazon is so deceiving. They said that it can fit.
5,most interesting,"This is a very good book. In his book Cass Ingram lists the most available foods (incl. herbs & spices etc...) with their cures. In a first part of the book he sums up the 12 most common diseases (heart disease, cancer, arthritis, ADD, etc...) linked with the 12 most important (supermarket) remedies to cure the illness. In another chapter he reviews all possible supermarket remedies (foods), gives some tips on storing and using the foods and explains why the food can cure certain ailments. I do like this book because with some inexpensive remedies (foods) one can do wonders. No more searching for hard to find and costly remedies, but just simple remedies that can soften or cure ailments. A must have."
2,Disappointed,This book was not very user friendly; had to sift through too much information to find specifics.
3,Nostalgic movie but not for today's kids...,"If you were born in the 1960's or before, you might enjoy this sweet, simple Disney tale of young love and the wilderness. Today's youth, however, will find it a snooze. MacArthur and Lynley are beautiful and display great promise."
1,Review of the movie and book,"There are some differnt things about the book ""The Light in The Forest"" and the movie. Like True Son he was a little boy on the cover. Gordie he wasn't even in the movie. The Parsons had a girl and not a boy. also at the end of the movie True son went back to the whites land. When he got back he got fiting with uncle Wilse. I thouht you shold know about the movie and the book."
4,"""The Light In The Forest""","The movie ""The Light In The Forest"" was a ""two thumbs up"" movie. If I were to make a one word summary of my opinion I would say exhilarating. I really liked the movie. Some examples of elements are for one it gets interesting in the movie. For two it's more exciting than the novel. And for three I liked the conflict and the resolution. I enjoyed these elements because they were really exciting. The video does not compare to the novel. This is because some characters are missing and events were left out. Not to give out the ending, but the novel and the movie's ending was really different."
2,"Read this book it is cool "" Light in the Forest""","I think the book and the movie are good because some books don't have the same details in the movie . The movie compares to the book because it has the same characters that were in the book and now in the movie . There were two characters in the book that were different. One of the characters was the Parson's daughter, Millie, who in the novel was the Parson's son. And Gordie Johnny's brother, was replaced with Shenandoe in the movie. Johnny fell in love with Shenandoe. In the book they said that Myra was mean, in the movie she acted nice and concered in True Son language."
2,The Movie VS. The Book,"The name of this movie as you can tell is ""The Light in the Forest. Some of the things in the movie were the same as in the novel. One thing that was similar is most of the same characters were in both the movie and the novel. Another similarity that i liked was that they had most of the same settings. One thing that i disliked was the fact that True Son's white brother wasn't in the movie, instead he was replaced by the servant girl. I didn't enjoy the elements of the movie because it wasn't like the novel. There were many things that were different. One big difference is that Gordie (True Son's white brother) wasn't in the movie. Another big difference is that there was no name for the servant girl in the novel and that she wasn't really paid attention to in the novel. However in the movie she was as important as Gordie was in the novel. That is what i think of the movie and how it campares to the novel."
2,The Light In The Forest Movie vs. Novel,It is an alright movie.It had some adventure. It is based in the 1760's America. In the novel the main character gets in a predicament where he must choose between his real English family or the Indian family that kidnapped him.But the movie sometimes had chracters and events that weren't in the novel.Also the movie sometimes forgot to put details in some scenes.
1,the light in the stupid forest,I saw the movie and read the book the light in the forest.Well i really dont like the movies or the book I defeninatly wouldnt go pay to watch this movie .they could have made it realistic.In the book it was different than in the movie.they had people and stuff in the novel was very different.some people that are missing is gordie he wasnt in the movie.the movie was dumb and i really didnt like it.
3,The Light in the Forest review,"Iv'e seen this movie called The Light in the Forest and it was wonderful. The original author was Conrad Richter, then they turned the book into a movie.The video was ful of adventure and excitement cast int he 1760's in america. I think the movie was cool but I don't like some parts of it,like when they left out and added some characters and scenes that were not in the novel. The again I like the part when Trueson got into a fight with his uncle Wilse and first got beat up but the beated his uncle up. I also liked that the video ended with a happy ending and everybody is okay, but in the novel Trueson was left hanging and doesn't know where to go. The video and the novel are somewhat the ame and different. The video focuses Trueson's problem is his uncle and the novel focuses himself getting home to his Indian home. The video is bases on a Disney movie and has a happy ending to it.I recomend you see the movie, I think people will enjoy it."
2,The Light In The forest,I saw this movie at school. It was okay. It had a lot of action.I have read the book though. Thats why I like the movie. I don't think I would like if I hadn't have read the book. The thing about it is that it's old and not as cool as the new and imporved movies. It doesn't have all the things that movies have these days. These are teh things that I liked about the movie. I liked the action and fights that it had in it. I also liked the cool indian characters. I also like the cool outdoor setting of the movie. The video is a lot like the novel. It has some new characters and some of the same. But some characters that I think were very important went even in the video. I wish they were. The ending is very exciting. And thats all i have to sayy about that. If you like boring movies than this is DEFINITLY the one for you. Believe i have read the book and seen the movie...
2,Does not resemble the novel it is based on.,"The Walt Disney film version of ""The Light in the Forest"" has little in common with the message and tone of the Conrad Richter novel it is allegedly based on. I will not go into any details, but will state that this movie is a complete butchery of the classic story of a white boy raised by Indians and torn between the ties of blood and loyalty. If you love the novel then avoid this movie. If you're trying to cheat on an English exam by watching this movie instead of reading the book then you will fail your test.If you have not read the book or are ambivilent towards it then you just may enjoy this movie as a mild piece of Disney escapism similar to ""Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier"" or ""The Parent Trap."""
3,The Light In The Forest,I have seen the movie and read the book. I liked the book better. The reason is because the movie was not like the book. I liked the book because the book does not have any love scenes in it. The movie has Shenandoe instead of Gordie. And in the book Cuyloga seems younger than he looks in the MOVIE. And Aunt Kate seems nicer in the movie than in the book. I would think that people should watch the movies then read the book.
4,"chris,s review","The Light in the Forest movie didn't compare to the book that well . There's no Gordie. There is a girl that True Son falls in love with instead. I like the movie better, it's faster than a long book and the movie has pictures . I like the movie better but you can choose the one you like best ."
2,NO fun,"I have been buying a variety of workout DVD's since I started working out daily about 6 months ago. I only workout at home using DVD's, and I have found some really great ones. This Shape workout was totally boring. The music is bad, the moves are blah. I could only get thru the first 10 minutes or so, before I turned it off. I will be donating this one to who ever will take it."
4,Hi intensity with lots of low impact options,"I've really enjoyed this tape. The instructor is sweet, but not too much. I liked: her cueing, variety of intense options, the different style of ab work, the ability to have the segments play in the order I want and the ten minute cardio section was also excellent. Disliked: the movements are off-beat...a lot. Not terribly noticible if the music is down considerably. Please don't let this last comment deter you from buying this video. If I lost this dvd, I still would buy it again!"
2,not that great,"I've done alot of workout videos but this one was just pointless. the cardio was okay but i didn't like the 10 minute toning segments. some of the moves were lame and didn't make sense. the lower body segment was very disappointing. the moves doesn't really target the buns & thighs. Normally you would feel some type of burn when working the lower body but i felt nothing. you could've sat on the floor for 10 minutes and got the same result. Same for the abs segment. If you are going to create a 10 minute workout, make sure the moves are really intense and effective. I would not recommend this dvd for those who want to lose weight. this is more for toning and firming. if you are looking for a good toning video i would definitely recommend Jillian Michaels' No More Trouble Zones. For a real bun & thigh workout...try Winsor Pilates Bun & Thigh Sculpting. For a real total body makeover in under 30 minutes, try Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred."
2,Very Challenging even for those in shape,"I exercise regularly, am 5'3 and 117 pounds. I work out using home DVDs, and had high expectations for this workout. I found the workout to be exceptionally strenuous and not even remotely ""fun"". I find Denise Austin DVDs to be much more motivating and reasonable to execute. I also enjoyJillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred.The bottom line is that this workout felt like work."
4,Great workout!,"I love this dvd! If I want an all over workout, I can do the full hour long workout or I can pick and choose which segments I want. I love the fact the she has the 20 min cardio section plus another 10 min cardio section for an extra boost. My arms and butt get a great workout and I have already lost a dress size within a few weeks. Worth the money!"
4,"Fast, Easy, Fun!","Great and simple workout! I loved how quick and effective the 20 minute workout was. The instructor is bubbly and easy to follow. I really like the 10 minute body area specific workouts too. They included new and easy exercises that I hadn't done before. And one of my favorite things about this workout dvd is that you don't need alot of space to do the workouts, and you don't need a ton of equipement either. Just some hand weights! The simpler, the better for me!"
2,Not the best,"I bought this hoping for a really great workout, and was very disappointed. It's very ballet-like and non-impact, so I'm sure there is a subset of people out there who will love it. If you want to really sweat-then no. It does offer a lighter change of pace if you normally do more intense workouts. Still, it just felt lame. The most annoying thing was the video was so distorted, it made the chic look 8 feet tall and about 50 pounds. That was a little disturbing, like exercise from another dimension?"
5,Best Shape Ever!,"I love this workout DVD. I was able to finally loose those stubborn last 10 pounds. Elise makes the workout seem fun and easy. There are 3 levels, beginner, intermediate, and advance. I like to combine cardio with toning to the arms and abs. I used to be a runner and my muscles were so sore, my joints impacted. I also had a sprained ankle. This workout is easy on the joints; by using squats and knee lifts to give you high intensity yet low impact. I use it at least 3 times a week and I never get sick of it. I recommend this workout for anybody who wants to get in shape."
4,Easy to use Body Trap,Sometimes the simplest designs work the best. I used this trap to help eliminate a muskrat problem in a pond. It works well and is easy to use.
3,Heavy but works,"Used this stand over the weekend. It is a basic steel stand. It climbed well and felt stable. However, this thing is heavy and the backpack straps are kind of thin making it a chore to tote very far into the woods. If you hunt close to your parking spot, it will work fine."
1,bad,"This book is very corrupt in it's theology. Beware the book is written from a United Pentecostal point of view and therefore it denies the Trinity and other central Christian viewpoints. The person goes to great depths to try and make the early church fathers match his views...,"
3,Not a bad book.,"it is not a bad book. You just have to work at the words. I found volume 1 to be very helpful to get a historical background about China. The vocabulary and grammar provided a good foundation. There are questions and exercises with answers. The answers to the exercises could be better organized. What I really would have like was to be able to get the audio for this book to help with pronunciation and listening comprehension. That would have made the book complete. I got my copy for $4 and it was worth it. Like anything if you put effort into it, you will definitely get a good foundation for furthering your studies."
5,"Mundial 5100 Series 10-Inch Chef's Knife, Black",Great Knife... Beat the crap out of it still keeps sharp .... Easy to get used to. Great for any task big or small.
5,ya gotta have one!,"I have owned and used a number of utilitarian through big-named chef knives both personally and professionally.I can see a bit wider and smoother edged blade top for a pro using it all day long.I can see a ""purist"" wanting a real wood handle.I can see someone with bigger hands wanting a ""bigger"" handle.I can see wanting ""blood grooves"" on the blade.but, ya know what? for the price, this is ONE SERIOUS kitchen workhorse for every home cook and seasoned pro alike!!I simply cannot find a single reason for NOT having this product in your kitchen.A MUST buy!!!"
3,So dissapointed,"After one month of serious usage with my new saw, I found a two-bit belt was key to the flawless operation I had come to expect from this rugged beauty. Timing Belt woes . . Absolutely rediculous its difficulty in accessing to repair . . dealer doesn't have a clue about its short comings - unavailability of parts . . and a cheap belt no-less!! How could this critical part be so overlooked regarding reliability?? . .It shut me down and is going to be a real headache to find the part and then reassemble the shaft assembly . . The tiny set screws are soft metal and very hard to get at. I will have to drill out one of them - hope for the best. Will probably have to order a new part they sit in. Not happy anymore! . .Dissapointed."
3,Beware if you want advice from JET,"My SuperSaw arrived in March. Set up was somewhat difficult, but managable. My real problem came with the product support offered by JET. I emailed the company with a request for insight into how to re-wire the machine for 230V. The diagrams in the manual are, in my mind not too specific and clear. In fact, they seem to deal with only the motor and not the ON/OFF switch which must be also re-wired. I asked for help in a list of specific questions which concerned the availability of instructions, the purchase of stress plates to replace the present ones. I received a one line reply stating that the instructions were in the manual. It seems a rather calalier attitude toward customer support for an expensive machine, on which the warranty is voided if the owner screws up trying to do what the manufacturer says is possible. Anhow, I'm not a satisfied consumer and will not purchase any WMH Tool Group products in the future. If you buy, beware."
2,AWFUL ENDING..MAKES THE WHOLE MOVIE POINTLESS.,"Everything is great about this movie UNTIL THE ENDING. DISGUSTING.The whole movie is pointless because of the last 10 minutes......SPOILER ALERT BELOW:After watching this boy struggle and almost get killed to find this treasure to save his grandfather, the grandfather does not want it and so the boy PUTS IT BACK IN SOME OLD TEMPLE. WHATTTTTTTTTT I JUST WASTED 90 MINUTES WATCHING HIM FIGHT WITH PEOPLE, DIG, SWIM, TO FIND IT.Also the bird says he is going to stay on the island? So he dumps grandpa to stay..looks like grandpa is going to go to the rest home since he has no money and now no pets so it is easier for them to dump him.This movie had such potential until the awful ending!"
1,JUNK,I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE FROM ZIGGIES WHARE HOUSE AND IT DIDNT PLAY AT ALL IT WAS UNWATCHABLE DONT BY THIS VHS OR YOULL GET RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Very beautiful but not good for every day wear.,I just got this necklace today and is very pretty. The rope it comes on is very nice and you can adjust it to the size you want. The workmanship is great. The stone is just the right color and the entire necklace is not very heavy. You almost don't know it is there. I would buy it again in a heart beat. The only thing bad is that if you wear it all the time like I do the silver finish comes off and not it is starting to look ugly.
5,Beautiful!,This Pentacle was well made and ready to wear. It arrived quickly and was a good price. I would buy from them again.
3,Good for price,I doubt this is real pewter. It comes on a crappy black thread cord. but it's not ugly or garishly large. i wear it alot
5,wunderbar!,"the necklace came the same day it was supposed to. I can echo what most have been saying, its better than the photos. I have yet to encounter any snags with the black cord that comes with the necklace, in fact i actually like how it is easily adjustible! The actual pendant has not been ""turning over"" as somebody else has stated. All in all i would definitely purchase this product again as a perspective buyer!"
3,a little tug and the rope was broken,This piece is beautiful. but the Rope fell apart after 2 weeks. I would recommend having a backup for when it goes
4,"Lovely Pentagram Pendant, False ""Jewel.""","The pendant in and of itself is very lovely, as the picture shows. As some have said, the cord is tied a bite awkwardly, but that's an easy fix. Great detail; love the five ""dots"" right by the gem - as well as those around the border - to match the five points/elements. However, the gem is not as shown, at least in my case. This pendant was made to have an empty spot in the center to go with the other five; I received it with a rhinestone/sequens-like ""jewel"" glued into the center hole. (There was even glue smeared across it a bit.) I would pry out the jewel and just leave it be on its own but pewter is so sensitive. Other versions of this pendant are out and about that contain fake gems in the small five holes, too. So, for the lack of a real gem, the price may be a bit steep, but the details of the rest of this piece (and 'free' shipping) make up for it, I think."
3,"review of Kraft Easy Mac Cups, Original, 2.05-Ounce Microwave Cups","My kids love this stuff. Great for convenience, so-so for taste. Not as good as the regular Kraft Mac & Cheese, but ok for a quick meal."
2,Cheese Dust,"My delivery contained 4 open containers and cheese dust was everywhere. To Amazon's credit, they replaced the shipment without any problems and the second order was fine."
1,FAKE CHEESE TASTE,"My kids eat the boxed Kraft Mac and cheese so I thought these were a great idea. YUCK! I bought a whole case and had to get rid of them. No one would eat them...they taste different than the boxed variety. They have a strong, fake cheesy, chemical flavor and odor.....maybe from the plastic the product is microwaved in. BLECH."
2,"Fake cheese taste, but kids love it","It has a strong fake cheese taste and smell, but I give it 2 stars because my kids like it and it is very convenient to make."
1,Great food,"Yep..as said below..This is a great food if you have no time to prepare food for your kids and have no interest in giving their kids a healthy balanced diet. Why waste time with fresh, nutrional , vitamin rich food when you can chuck this stuff down their throat in seconds.You could make a home made version in five minutes- but you would not get all the benefit of those preservatives,additives and extra chemicals. Save money when your 13 year old kid can fit in their parents clothes!...woohoo!!"
3,Mac Snack,Not as good a mom used to make but good for a quick snack and better than some boxed stuff.
3,Not the cheesiest,"It's easy, but it isn't very flavorful. I guess it is a tradeoff - if you want it fast, this will work. I recomment adding stuff to it to punch up the flavor a little (pepper, real cheese, etc)"
5,My 11-years old loves it,"I personally don't eat mac-&-cheese, but my 11-years old son loves them. He also prepares them by himself. I don't know about the price in comparison to local supermarkets, and, I'm sure these pre-cooked foods and processed cheese are not the healthiest things you can feed your children with, but it is clear, that these are easy to prepare and tasty."
1,Never received it,"For some reason Amazon never shipped the two items I bought, and for some reason I didn't even could make an A to Z guaranteed or something. I feel swindled..."
2,cheap,I have had to go fast within a few weeks of installing them on my bike. I don't think that the quailty is there.
4,A great statistics reference book,"While it seems odd to describe a very good book on statistics as a great read versus merely as a great reference book, this latest edition by George Box et al., is very much both. Useful new topics were added in this edition, e.g., experimentation using surface response methods, graphical analysis of variance, computer analysis of complex designs, simplification by transformation, etc. It stays on my reference shelf in easy reach."
2,This edtion is full of typo and mistakes--much worse than the first edition,"This book is supposed to be a great text book desigend for the course--EXPERIMENT DESIGN. However, after using it for the first 2 weeks, we found it is very obscure in telling the basic concepts and the examples are long but distractive. I have to read other books to learn the basic concepts to understand what this book is telling. My reference books are 'PROBABILITY AND STATISTCS FOR ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS', by Ronald E. Walpole 7th edtion and 'Probability, random variables and stochastic processes', by Athanasios Papoulis, 4th edtion.What's more, this book is unique in that it has the most typos I have ever found in an textbook.For example:Chap 2. Problem 14. line 3 pp 65, the ""probablilty shoulde be about 1 'change' in 500"".Chap3. Ex3.6 line3 pp84,"" the corresponding 'scabbed' t distributions"".Mistakes are almost in every chapters. When you read, you will found more, enjoy them."
1,Not recommended as a text book,"As a text book, this book will drive students crazy. Despite the typos which can be found not occasionally, I found the authors wrote most of the examples using large paragraphs but hard to comprehend.Pretty often the results they generated comes from nowhere. No clear deduction, some times even no equations, just tell you some meanlingless number. The authors must have treated students as experienced as they are, therefore they omit most of the important details for a student to follow. Obviously, by using computer software, they can easily get answers from problems they made without bothering write down how they can get it by pencil and paper.My suggestion is that if ever you want to learn some statistics, get some books which are clearly written and well illustrated. This book is obviously overrated."
4,Deep bitchy fierce chat track as only Ms. Candy can deliver!,"If you know this track, you love this track - with mixes by MIKE DUNN and others, this authentic Chicago deep house at its best - the kind of bitchy 'chat' track that was popular in the early/mid 90s when house was still real - yes, the lead ""vocals"" are from none other than MISS CANDY J - who may or may not really be a ""he"" ala CELEDA. No matter, the hilarious ode to battered love - ""What do I do with this word NIKE across my forehead?!"" - is still a deliciously twisted floor filler. I once saw CANDY J perform ""live"" at CATCH ONE in LA back the day - where are you now girl?"
3,Knock OFF,"It's a knock off of nemo and shark's tale. The animation as well as the dialogue look like interns made this movie. Buy used or rent. Not new, because once you watch it. That will be the last time"
3,short but sweet,"This movie shows that with some team work anything can happen, even if you get killed in the process you did what you could to make a difference in the world. This movie was short but it a good movie."
3,"May not be militarily accurate, but it is entertaining","Active Stealth is a standard search and rescue B programmer with Daniel Baldwin and Fred Williamson. The film also features August 1986 Playboy Playmate Ava Fabian in a supporting role. Lots of gun battles and some decent aerial footage with the Stealth and other aircraft can be found throughout the film. Great commentary by director Fred Olen Ray. The packaging mentions a trailer, but there is no trailer included."
1,This is so innaccurate!,"This movie was a real loser. It is so innaccurate. ""Rangers assulting a target in broad daylight with standard issue M-16's an M9's with no silencers or scopes. Most Rangers would use an M-4 or an MP5. No face paint, no stealth at all. Also, what Army unit flys a news crew style helicopter to pickup Rangers in the middle of South America? It should have been a Blackhwawk or a Huey gunship with AH-64 Apache air support.The capabibility to shoot of these ""Rangers"" is terrible too. At little more than 100 feet they empty an entire clip and hit nothing but air.The worst part of the movie was Army pilots flying an Air Force F-117 TWO SEATER WITH A CARGO BAY? NO NO NO!! It is a 1 man AIR FORCE, stealth bomber. Also Army pilots ""carrier qualified"" and F-14 qualified? No.No. This movie was terrible, do not rent or buy it."
4,This was ordered for my mother,"I have this movie, and found it to be very watchable. I knew it would be something that my mother would like, so ordered a used copy for her. I haven't heard any feedback from her yet. She did receive very fast shipping on it, and it arrived in good shape."
1,God Help Us!!!!!!!!,"What were these people thinking. As far as I am concerend 1 star is too many stars this movie does not even deserve a point on of a star. The movie is very unrealistic. First of all there is no way the Air Force would let any Lt. Fly the F-117, let alone an army Lt. And in this movie an Army Lt. is an expert on flying this bird. I'm sorry it would never happen. The Army is not even allowed to fly fixed wing aircraft. they are limited to Helocopters. Please no one buy this it is extremely bad!!!!!!!!"
4,Great she-wolves...it's pay back time,"The universe of werewolf the apocalypse is very dark, filled with hate and abuse. In real life lots of stupid persons hit their ladies...well...the Black Furies hit back.Some people will find it weird the way the main characters behave, they don't seem to be human, they kill a guy in an instant (just because this guy tried to seduce you in a silly way), but surprise...they aren't Humans, they are werewolves...worst, they are from the tribe of the black furies, and they don't take [junk] from anyone, especially a male ape.Now technically speaking, the choice of not collouring this comic was very intelligent, it's scarier this way; the drawing is very strong and competent as is the story."
1,very disappointed,"We ordered this book for my daughter to use as she teaches English to people who speak other languages. We are big fans of Usborne books, but we were very disappointed with this book. The stickers were impossible to pull off the sheet. Instead of nice,neat stickers to place in the book there were torn, ragged edged stickers that looked terrible when placed in the correct spots. It looks so bad that she will not be using it in her classroom. Instead we will be returning it and hopefully getting our money back. If you want this book stick with the hardcover, non sticker book."
5,First Thousand Words in English - Wonderfully motivating book,"I bought this book for my niece (7) in Switzerland. This book awakes the curiosity, is very easy to learn with as it is beautifully illustrated. The drawings are very pleasing and motivating. Great book! I highly recommend it. Amazon does such a great job in regards of customer service: Fast, Reliable."
2,Stickers Don't Stick,"The stickers in the book barely stick to the paper. The edges curl up and the stickers fall off. My daughter got so frustrated she gave up and left the book on the table, which is unheard of. This kid loves stickers.I think a page reference on the sticker page would be helpful, it is difficult to find the set of stickers that go with the page you are working on.FYI - I tried contacting [...] which looks like the publisher listed on the back of the book for a replacement. They refused to do anything and referred me back to Amazon for a replacement."
1,Worst sticker book.,Don't buy this book. You need to be a surgeon to be able to remove the stickers from the sticker pages. You then have to search endlessly with your child to find the proper location for it. There are many other more enjoyable options that do not provide as much frustration as this product...
2,Not best item for granddaughter.,"The stickers were fine and the book had a thousand words. But, really kids don't have patience to learn much with this learning system. She played with stickers for few minutes and was bored ready to move on to something else. I would not waste money on this kind of book again."
2,Too much like candy,"These dried strawberries do taste good - indeed, they're addictive. When I eat one, I usually end up eating several more. But they're too sweet. The sugary taste and texture of this brand of dried strawberries makes me feel like I'm eating candied strawberries. This wasn't what I expected from the description. I should have paid more attention to the other review that complains of over-sweetening. Don't buy these, unless you want to eat strawberry candy; buy another brand which lets you enjoy the natural strawberry flavor and texture more."
1,Not Freeze-Dried,"I ordered this item because I thought it was freeze-dried kinda like dehydrated, but it's not! They taste like they were pickled and rolled in sugar! Yuck! The original strawberry taste is gone. The company sent them to me very promptly and in great packaging, but I really thought it was something else... The page does not provide a good description of what the product really is."
2,Warning! Its candy!,I don't believe these are real strawberries. I think this product is made from strawberry pulp + sugar + who knows what. They seem like slightly more healthy strawberry gummy bears candy.
4,Informative,The text in this book is very helpful and insightful with the lastest research studies of best practice for working with children who have language and communication disorders.
2,Don't waste your money,"Unfortunately, I was really disappointed with this product.A few things come to mind immediately.The light pink color looks pretty but I found that after a few uses and after placing it in my backpack and purse, it was very hard to keep clean.The magnetic clasp was very annoying as it made a loud sound every time I shut the case AND I had someone ask me if the magnet affected the electronic capabilities of the device. ???? I stopped using it anyway.The belt clip is a SHAM. The cheap plastic screw on belt clip (which never screws on all the way) was bulky and did not attack to my belt loop properly. I never used it either.Look for another case people."
1,Crap!,"This is not good! It's a really weird CD...Do not buy this CD thinking that the rest of the music will have the same vibe as the single ""For Real"". The single was great and I rarely buy new artist (although she's not really new) but I try to stick with my old favorites. Anyway I got this couldn't wait to hear what this beautiful young lady had in store and I was blown away of how crappy this was.This CD has 1 good song and it's that one single that overplayed on the urban stations. I expected more of a Minnie Ripperton vibe but what you get is some wierd African style beats sound as if made by a computer and some Eryka Badu weird lyrics and a rip off Chaka Khan impersonation but if you like Eryka Badu at her weird moments or maybe some would say at her ""deep"" moments then this you will enjoy. For music fans that like lyrics that they can understand, this is not for you."
5,"The wait is over,and i am so satisfied.","First I'd like to say to The Larrieuxs that if you guys keep us waiting again it will be all right, as long as the next album is as good as this one. To the world, this album is a soul stirring piece that dares to touch on subjects that most of us would just assume stay ignorant of. It is not often that an artist is able to mix head knodding rythms with lyrics and topics that stimulate the political mind as well as the spiritual and emotional. I would reccomend this album to any and everyone who cares about someone in this world or the next; also to anyone, who loves good music with an incredible voice on top. Bravebird is another hit,Please keepem coming."
4,Wonderful to listen to,"I bought this album shortly after it came out in 2004 because I'm such a fan of Amel's songs, her voice, her passion, etc. More than three years later, I still pop this CD in when I want to relax or just be swept away by the soul and soothing voice of an amazing artist. I have three Amel solo albums and Groove Theory's album, and while I enjoy all of them, this is my favorite.""Dear to Me"" is one my my favorite songs by anyone. That is an R&B; song, no doubt about it. You just want to sit down, close your eyes and gently nod your head to that song. ""Bravebird"" is a touching song. I think ""Beyond"" is a haunting ballad that is sung with such emotion -- it's the kind of song that could never be a pop hit because it's far too real and filled with substance. Truthfully, every song on this CD is enjoyable to listen to."
5,Put this CD in and let it play.,Love this CD. Heard it in a friends car and brought it the next day. Very smooth and real. It worth buying and supporting a real artist.
4,last but not out!,"yeah word is that this will be amel's last and this is one of the reasons she put sooooooooo much work @ it. i seriously and sadly believe that her indie label is doing very little to keep her on her feet to keep going. on less amel goes back to epic or another, amel should rest with this cause she is already done what she came here to do. and thatz a rap!"
3,"AMEL , AMEL , AMEL","Why must thou confuse your audience???? she has a great voice but at times do you really get her music?? a lot of people don't and thats sad cuz this cd is good, not great but its a good sophmore release. i wish she had some guests on the cd and used other producers....maybe next time"
2,lilkeith,I WAS DISSAPPOINTED IN THIS ALBULM. LIKE THE WRITER BEFORE WROTE YOOU WAIT FOR THE NEXT CD AND YOU HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND DUD. I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WILL BUY THE CD OF A NEO SOUL ARTIST WITHOUT EVEN HEARING THE ALBULM FIRST. I LOVE AMEL SO I SUPPORT HER BUT SHE NEEDS TO LET SOME NEW PRODUCERS TAKE HER TO THE NEXT LEVEL. TO MUCH TALENT TO BE WASTED ON WEAK TRACKS.
3,Hopefully it will grow.on you,"i just boughtb this albumn today and the only track i am really feeling is ""for real"" a jazzy quiet storm type song which is realy cool and relaxed but the rest of the albumn i'm not feeling i don't know why but it's like i love her voice but i guess i'm looking for lighter melodies or somthing. i could see Amel being a huge artist cause she sounds better than the rest who are out there but sometimes i'm looking for a more well-rounded general sound. maybe this albumn will grow on me or maybe it will not. because i like her so much i hope it will"
1,Amel should do better !,"I bought this album last year in May,expecting something really good.I thought,this lady writes very heartfelt lyrics,has a pleasant voice,but overall the CD sounded like a poorly arranged,produced,'home-made' album.Certainly Larrieux has talent,but I was not able to go through all her CD...I was irritated, don't know,the album didn't show the homogeneous,organic sound and feelings of Floetic or Jill Scott..A little bit of Soul,a little bit of Jazz,,a little bit of folk,a little bit of ethnic/world,some 'chamber' Soul ( kind of Al-Jarreau-esque vocalese. )..there was not a musical concept.It is a 'patch-work',more than a woven tapestry.So I resumed the CD in order to give it a second chance..Sorry,I have the same,same mixed feelings,it doesn't relax me,I do not FEEL it,I don't go into it ( better,it doesn't go into me). ! I couldn't never play it twice in a row.. it tires me.The best tracks are 'For Real' and ' Beyond '.Next time."
5,Wake Up People!!!!,"What a talent. It appears that the world doesn't know who she is. I have been a fan of Amel Larrieux since Groove Theory. They did not get the respect they deserved and now that Amel is on her own she is not being looked at. WAKE UP PEOPLE! I wish her music was more supported. The music, lyrics and messages are beautiful. I love Amel! It's a shame that with all of the reviews we have posted about her and this cd, only people who know her name will ever read them on Amazon. I wonder if we could somehow get it out to the buyers that this is a cd worth buying. I cannot say enough about this woman. There is alot of overlooked talent in this music industry. What a shame!"
5,Good Music!!,"It's been a awhile since I purchased a CD where the music and the lyrics were good. This album has both. I love it! I was watching BET one night and saw a Circuit City commercial for this CD. I remembered her from Groove Theory and the song that they played on the commercial was pretty good. I bought it the next day and have not been able to stop listening to it. My favorites are ""For Real"", ""Beyond"", ""We Can Be New"" and ""Congo"". I am now an avid Amel fan...."
5,NEW AND SOULFUL,"I Love Amel's style, she has this perfect pitch and jazzy vocals. I'm so glad Bravebird was finally released. My favorite songs are : For Real, Bravebird, Dear To Me, All I Got, We Can Be New, Giving Something Up, & Your Eyes. Some of the slow tracks sound like Dido Rip Offs. But all in all, Bravebird is One of the hottest album's of the year."
5,I Love Good Music:):):),This CD is worth every dollar you spend. The replay value if phenomenal I love music that does not date itself within a week. This is a great CD and so different from her first CD. I don't hear Amel on mainstream radio that much these days. I have to depend on ads to find out what is coming out. I found out about the CD based on an ad I saw. I guess advertising has some benefits! This CD was well worth the wait. You will not be dissatisfied. I am looking forward to a concert and hopefully there will be one soon!!!
2,"Amel Larrieux, ""Bravebird""","I hate to wreck the voting curve, but this album simply is not good. Amel Larrieux dropped her first solo album in 2000 and then blessed us with some good guest spots like Guru's ""Guidance"", Soulive's ""I Don't Know"" and her duet with Glenn Lewis, ""What's Come Over Me?"" (from the ""Barbershop"" soundtrack). All of those songs beat any song on this album. The only good ones are the first two, ""For Real"" and the title track. After that, the album falls flat with generic production and faltering, sometimes oversung, vocals from Amel.I hear that this is her last album and it shows because it seems like she worked on this album while looking at the front door. If you want her best work, stick with Groove Theory or Infinite Possibilites."
5,an undermarketed genius and timeless.,"Rarely can you buy a cd album from an artist with a divine lulling and entrancing voice, inspiring lyrics with a sway-able rhythm that is soothing and relaxing simultaneously.amel larriuex is an artist I can listen to,track to track again and again and again.In this category I would compile togetherjhelisa,india.arie,sade,sweetback,amy winehouse,lina,cree summer,gabriela anders,minnie ripperton,cordruoy,maysa leak,nnenna freelon,nina simone,and diane reeves.amel larrieux's bravebird and infinite possiblities are timeless favourites for me.it is good dinner party music,car music,work music,start the day music,end the day music and whatever kind of mood I am in type of music.If you like any of the singers I mentioned,then at least have a listen.Radio stations should play more of this type of music."
2,The epitome of bad off-shore support,"I use this year after year because it ties into QuickBooks. The software is OK, but for the last three years I've had the worst support experiences of my life. This year I didn't understand something on the mailing they sent me so I called them. The support person kept telling me in broken English to click on this, or select that. I kept telling her I was looking at a piece of paper and she just didn't get it. Last year I spent three hours in on line chat with a tech person named ""Bob"" because my software decided to uninstall."
2,Wrong movie,"I accidentally picked this movie thinking it was the Dream House that was recently in the theatre, but this is an older release of the same name. Acting wasn't great and the sound volume was up and down constantly. The story wasn't too bad. There were a lot of ""gotcha"" moments that made you jump. But the quality of the acting and sound brought the rating down for me."
4,nicole kidman.- beautiful.brave and smart.,"Kidman in one of her best performances.-Great acting in the role of a beautiful, brave and smart woman who beats in a dangerous ""chess game- like"" situation, a serial killer intent to kill her husband and claim her as a prize."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A tense three-person thriller that makes the most of its desolate marine locations and claustrophobic ships, Dead Calm is a skillful film that could have used a better ending but is nonetheless worth watching."
4,Terrific movie,"Love Nicole Kidman. This is a terrific thriller. One of her ""early roles"" - before she started using so much botox...."
4,Ok Movie,It's an ok movie suspense and mystery worth seeing. I saw it long ago it was interesting to see again.
3,A Strong 3 1/2 Stars....,"Dead Calm is a great thriller. I actually give this film 3 1/2 stars only because I have seen better thrillers however this is a really good movie. I must say that BILLY ZANE delivers a Great performance in this movie. Not crazy about Nicole Kidman's performance or Sam Neill's. Billy Zane makes this movie for he never fails to disappoint us at playing ""the villian"". Starts out boring but the action really begins when they find Zane's character, the only survivor from the boat he was on. From that point on, the movie really picks up speed thanks to Zane. Good entertaining thriller!!!"
3,Action Packed Chiller!!!,"I actually bought this movie based on my knowledge of seeing it years back. Certain parts were still fresh in my memory even before I watched it for a second time. I think the fact I bought this movie based on an old perception of it, and proving my perception correct on second watching should entice anyone to make it part of their collection. Aimed at all ages and genders. A heartbroken mother, a husband & a castaway with a serious bad attitude, at sea, should sum up this movie."
4,"Zane - insidious, Kidman - hottest!","Creepy, repulsive, pretty well done. Zane is truly insidious and Kidman's at her hottest. Funny, nobody here seems to mention Roman Polanski's first feature film ""Knife In The Water"" which is an obvious influence... if you like this movie you should definitely check it out!"
4,A fine little thriller.,"This movie may not have cost a bundle to make, but none the less it was finely done and is a really tight well crafted psychological thriller. Many weeks out to sea Nicole Kidman and her Husband help a stranded gentleman in a sinking ship. The man ,Billy Zane, is a paranoid delusional who is extremely dangerous. Situations take a turn for the worse when Husband and wife get separated, and Nicole Kidman gets stuck with the madman. The movie keeps you interested and you find yourself rooting for Nicole. The ending is a bit over the top, but still a most enjoyable ride."
4,Seaworthy thriller,"Alone on an ocean sailing trip to recuperate after the death of their son, a husband and wife (Sam O'Neill and Nicole Kidman) find themselves in a battle of wits against an insane killer (Billy Zane) who they rescue from the sea. The great majority of the film revolves around these three characters, and the actors generate some real tension, particularly Kidman and Zane, since O'Neill is alone on a sinking boat for much of the time. The tense stand-off between wife and killer and the husband's struggle to avoid drowning are effective counterpoints.The subplot about the dead son never figures in the film after the extraneous prologue, and there are some classic dunderhead horror film cliches (ie, the killer who won't stay dead and the victim who doesn't shoot the killer when she can), but this remains an entertaining film."
3,"GOOD PREMISE, POOR PACING","A COUPLE [NICOLE KIDMAN AND SAM NEILL] ARE TERRORIZED BY A PSYCHO [BILLY ZANE] AT SEA. THIS MOVIE HAS A CLEVER PLOT, BUT IT'S JUST PACED POORLY AND AFTER A WHILE, THE LACK OF ACTION SEEMS TO REALLY GET ME BORED. THERE IS A REAL STEAMY SEX SCENE BETWEEN NICOLE KIDMAN AND BILLY ZANE THAT IS WORTH WATCHING. I WILL GIVE IT THAT. IF YOU LIKE MOVIES SET AT SEA, YOU'LL DEFINITELY LIKE THIS."
2,Of two minds,"I watched this on the strength of my admiration for the lead actors. As in any good thriller, the characters do things that normal people would not do--but then we wouldn't have a movie, would we? Each mistake leads to another perilous situation; that's part of the fun of watching...sort of. But this isn't supposed to be a fun movie. The acting is excellent, the fear is palpable, the madness consuming. HOWEVER, the characters did make lots of stupid mistakes, and the hokey ending kind of blew it for me. Plus, the tragedy that kicks off the movie is quickly forgotten as the saga unfolds."
3,Decent Camera but does not live up to Fuji's reputation,"I am a big fuji-o-phile. I have taken this camera out 2 or 3 times and I own several of their f series cameras (f10 and f30 and of course the f50).My feeling is this camera is below average in its performance when compared to other cameras of its class. The stabilization is *great* and the face detection is first rate, but the f series has become known for its performance and this camera does not meet THOSE expectations which is what most of the reviewers are complaining about. Sadly, my f10 takes *far* better low light photos than the f50.If you look at the camera from a price/performance perspective you still have an excellent camera, but rumor has it the f60 will be out around mid feb."
2,Not good,"The image quality is poor, even at low ISO. The picture to picture time is too slow. The macro mode is bad. The auto-focus is weak. The interface is confusing. It's very difficult to take semi-long exposure pictures (if you set it to a low ISO, it simply takes a very dark picture instead of using a longer exposure). My older Canon seems better in every way, unfortunately."
1,Returned it Fast,"The negative reviews were true. I'm a low light level nut, so I had to buy the F50. Alas, in manual mode ISO 6400 in an ordinary livingroom I found that any table lamp in the picture darkenned everything else out to near black. On my computer, adjusting the gamma could not bring back the dark areas. There was just nothing there.The ad I saw said 12 megapixels. The manual says 12 ""effective"" megapixels. I agree with the review that said this looked like 1 megapixel. This is just an opinion. Fuji please don't sue me.The optical image stabilization combined with digital image stablization worked perfectly.The F50 outside case and controls are a thing of beauty.After returning the F50, I bought a factory refurbished F20 for $89 plus shipping. I'm very happy with the F20."
5,Excellent Digital Camera,"This is a great point and shoot digital camera, very easy and friendly to use and the features are amazing, also it is extremely versatile since you can use two types of media (SD and XD) so it makes easy to find additional storage media everywhere. It has a good lasting battery and the quality of the pictures is incredible.In addition, the double shoot feature, with and without the flash, is excellent when you are in low light situation and allows you to decide, in a single moment, which of the takes looks better.To sum up I recommend this camera to everyone looking for a high quality easy to use device."
4,Fuji FinePix 12 MP,"First time digital camera owner, fairly user friendly. Takes good, clear pictures, a little sluggish between shots. I would recommend this camera"
1,Lens control error,"Apart from the fact that 12 megapixel pictures just produces too big of a file and that the second highest resolution is only 6 megapixels, this camera gives me a ""lens control error"" half the time I power it up. That is very annoying especially considering that I've only had it for 3 weeks, now..."
3,Ships with weak batteries.,"Good set but I have had problems with the batteries that are shipping with these sets. The last 4 DeWalt reconditioned cordless tool sets I have purchased were shipped with batteries dated 2001 and most of those batteries have poor run time and low power. Compared to brand new batteries the difference is noticable. The 1-year warranty will get you a new battery if you find a service center that will replace them without a hassle. My service center does replace them, but they complain about it and I every time I take one in I am afraid they will refuse. For the price difference ($70) I recommend the new set which should come with batteries made in 2003."
1,Guide,"This book is quite helpful. As an architecture student working on a hypothetical embassy in Cuba, this book gave context to my building and showed the vast array of Cuban architecture."
2,New Direction for Yeah Yeah Yeahs,"Based on ""Gold Lion"" and the demo for ""Let Me Know,"" the YYYs are moving their sound in an acoustic direction. As a fan of their Neo-No Wave Sound, I'm not really fond of either of these tracks, though they are, admittedly, catchy. Karen O's voice is beautiful as usual, but it sounds much more restrained than on ""Fever to Tell,"" ""Yeah Yeah Yeahs"" or ""Machine."" Admittedly, their earlier sound is somewhat limiting, so it is nice to see them doing something different ... I just wish was a BETTER different. (Oh yeah, as with other YYY singles, this one includes two useless remixes.)"
2,Big Disappointment,"Bought the Jet Supersaw because it had an enclosed dust collector, other features and it was cheaper than a cabinet saw. Imagine my surprise to find that the cabinet dust collection system was engineered to not provide the expected dust free environment. The dust collection floor has very small hole through which the dust is supposted to be circulated out. This had not been the case, even though I hooked up a powerful shop vacuum. The dust just collects. In addition, the dust comes up through the opening for the saw blade. This is the case even if you use a zero tolerance insert. I called Jet technical support, and the technician acknowledged that there was a problem. He suggested that I drill the holes larger, or cut out the bottom altogether! No suggestions about what dust collectors to use. Nothing that really could solve the problem. I highly recommend that any one thinking of buying the ""Super saw,"" think again and consider a DeWalt."
1,"""F"" for JET","Enough said. I have to give JET an F for Supersaw. Why? Because JET absolutely failed to fullfil a major function of a table saw design, that is proper dust collection. In fact, the dust collection doesn't work at all. Any sizable sawdust will clog up the dust collection compartment. Be ready to manually vacumm the compartment every time you rip several 2x4s. No joking. The little holes in the dust compartment are so small, that only the most powdery sawdust can go through. And not even power dust can go through once sawdusts clog the holes. JET engineers simply decided to ignore this big flaw. How can they manage that? A prominent woodworking magazine recently compared Supersaw to Dewalt counterpart. Result? Ofcourse they chose Dewalt."
4,"Leaked, low-to-mild heat...","This massage oil is nice to use, assuming there's any left. The bottle I had arrived okay, but I placed it on the dresser where it was knocked on its side... and (while not open) still managed to leak about 1/3rd of the bottle out. It is now stored in a plastic sandwich bag, just in case.The heat from this oil is actually quite mild. But the smell is amazing. (Especially when spilled. *snicker*)Note this is oil based, so it isn't really useful as a lubricant and I wouldn't recommend trying it as one."
5,"well, it's a poo pen",I gave this as a Christmas gift. It looked pretty real in the packaging. Who doesn't love a good poop joke?
1,cheap item,got this as a gift to give at Christmas to my family.They were not very impressed.can't really write with this because it doesn't have any support to the body of the pen.
4,Does not actually write on poo.,"I have to say, I was somewhat disappointed to find this pen doesn't actually write on poo. I'll have to find some other way to label my collection!Beware of ""Number Two"" pencils, too... I don't care what they say, that's actually graphite!"
5,The best ever !!,If you enjoy beautiful music & lyrics then this is the best. The style is adult contemporary & his voice is remarkable. He is the most powerfull & moving artist that I have ever heard.
1,Alfie should start again,"I am a long time fan of Alfie, he is an amazing talent, but on this album he is overly concerned with his performance. The intimacy and richness is gone. Replaced with theatrics. Alfie used to sound innocent and sincere, now he simply sounds pompous."
5,Overall best nutrition book I have in my home,"Paul Pitchford's book has been the best source I've found thus far for a deep and comprehensive understanding of foods, nutrition and the implications both positive and negative of what we consume. Not only does the book serve as an excellent reference guide on the subject of health and nutrition, it inspired me to see the connection between food and lifestyle choices and a sense of overall well-being. This is my favorite book to give to friends who express an interest in learning more about nutrition. Top notch."
5,A great text when understanding concepts in Chinese Medicine,"I first discovered this book in the nineties when working at a large natural foods chain as a natural products specialist. Since then, I am on my way to starting naturopathic medical school, where this book is considered a text book for classes in Chinese medicine/nutrition. I have discovered, any time I open the book to a random page, there is always really good, interesting, and applicable information on the page. Even if you're not a student in alternative/holistic medicine and health, this is still a great book when wanting to know about nutritional and supplemental properties of various foods, as well as some good recipes on food combining and recipes on balancing chi or the organ systems."
3,Useful for recipes,"I tried to read it from beginning to end, but i got lost in the confusing and complex rules of warm and cold, and ying and yang. If you read the first 50 pages, you'll know what I'm talking about."
1,Countless inaccuracies and biases,"This book cannot be defined anywhere near the scope of scientific integrity in the field of nutrition. There are so many inaccuracies with the data presented, which, I might add, is rather well cherry picked to support biases throughout. He also cherry picks from specific research, but leaves findings out of that research in order to support his own agenda, a la Cordain and Enig. This all goes along with the matter of how the book is incredibly poorly cited, mixing study with opinion, but yet is not nearly objective enough for scientific scrutiny. There are HUGE gaps in his research, and for someone who claims to be a nutrition researcher, Pitchford does a horrendous job. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there's horrible contradiction in Chinese medicine, as well as even the book!While large, and has quite a lot of good information, there's too much that's bad to pass off."
4,Healing with Whole Foods,"Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern NutritionExcellent reference material. Easy to understand, you don't have to have a PHD."
1,Not what I wanted,I was looking for a healthy recipe book not a medecinal book. I am too busy to read all of this and it doesn't fit my busy schedule.
5,Healing with Whole Foods,"This book contains amazing information that most of us have never been exposed to, and opens a whole new way of looking at our relationship with food.Healing with Whole Foods provides new understanding of health issues, and ways to repair damage done to our bodies."
5,Healing with Whold Foods Asian and Modern Nutrition,"This is my most used hand book for all the answers to questions about obtaining good health. I love this book. Highly recommend it if you are on a healthy path, plant based diet."
5,Great Reference and a MUST READ!,"This is my go to reference when it comes to healing properties of foods. I am a PhD student in Nutrition and this is unlike any textbook out there, which I love! It's a great book to explore the true benefits of foods and how our body reacts to each food.I love this book and hope others are willing to explore what this book has to offer!"
4,A gift for life,"....A wise and valuable book for anyone who is serious about examining their eating habits. A great guide for those who want to improve their life and health conditions and embrace the Chinese philosophy of Yin and Yang.This book also includes flavorful and delicious recipe's, to get you started on your journey."
5,Amazing!,"Such a great informative book for those looking to eat healthier, or combat illness through diet, and actually understand the benefits of certain foods and preparation methods. Very happy to have this book on the shelf. Includes recipes but just the information provided makes this a worthy purchase."
5,Great book for those who want to eat healthier,This book seems to have all the information you need to choose foods wisely and eat healthier. I will use this as a reference for my food selections as much as I possibly can. It is extremely thorough and well laid out to make it simple to find what you are looking for.I have learned so much from this book in the short time that I've had it.
5,Healing With Whole Foods,"This book is fabulous. It saved me from surgery. In the process of following his guidelines for a gall-bladder flush diet, I lost close to 50 pounds effortlessly. He knows foods, how to combine them and how they affect the human body. An outstanding book."
5,Awesome - A Bible of Good Nutrition,This book has changed our lives. The information is so complete and easy to use.
3,Useful but not exact,"This book can be very informative and contains a great amount of information but misses the mark especially in context to Traditional Chinese Medicine's(TCM)approach to nutrition and treatment with food. The author seems to advocate vegetarianism--which has never been a philosophy of TCM. Pitchford has also confused or flipped many of the energetic qualities of foods. On a lesser note the recipes lack flavor and vitality themselves.This is a good reference book, but by no means should this be your only reference to nutrition from either a western or eastern perspective."
2,How to heal your body by eating the right foods!,"Excellent reference for determining the constitution of your body and learning how to nurture and heal it with the right foods for you. Written for the layman, easy to read and understand. I find the remedies and advice effective."
5,Comprehensive and easy to understand nutrition concepts and specifics.,Paul Pitchford is a leading author in the US on foods that help and foods that harm us. His book needs to be on every medical practitioners desk for quick reference and for sharing instructions with our clients.
5,Fabulous,"This book is a great source of information on natural alternatives to improving your help. Very helpful and a great read, must buy."
5,Wonderful inspiring story!!!!,"I have always admired this movie. It teaches people promise, and hope, if you believe!! A must see movie for all ages."
5,Excellent,"The Deep End of the Ocean was a touching movie. It had a very interesting plot, excellent acting, and it was well casted. I have to disagree with those who say the acting was bad because it wasn't. This is one of those movies that you have to want to watch to appretiate.Tne years after her son's kidnapping, a confused, upset mother finds her long lost son standing on her doorstep. After being assured it was really him, the cops act quickly to bring him home. The problem is, he already had one. How can you give a child a loving, happy home if you are at the same time forcing him to leave his loving, happy life somewhere else?I would really recommend this movie if you want to see an emotional movie."
4,good movie,"Michelle Pfeiffer's performance pretty much saves this film. It was melo-dramatic at most parts, but wouldn't things be very dramatic in this situation? I liked the film, but it will depress you."
2,Good movie but sometimes depressing!,I saw this movie on HBO one time and I liked it. But this movie seems more like a made TV movie to me. The 3-year-old boy disappears and returns 9 years later who lives only 2 blocks away from his mom's house. Now does that sound like a mystery or what? Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is great and the rest of the cast are okay. Whenever I watch this movie it makes me cry sometimes but if you haven't seen this movie yet I think you should rent it because it's good. I recommened it to everyone!
2,kind of good but desperately trying to be sad,the cast in this movie is trying to make this movie dramatic and touching but is wasted with bad acting and cheesiness.Michelle Pfeiffer could have done a lot better.Whoopi Goldberg was kinda good in this
3,saved by Michelle Pfeiffer's performance,DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE ! THE CHILD THEY LOST 10 YEARS AGO ; NOW LEAVES JUST 2 BLOCKS AWAY FROM HIS PARENTS ! THE END .... DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE TOO... MICHELLE PFEIFFER'S PERFORMANCE IS WORTH IT THOUGH
5,deep end of the ocean,i received my movie fast and it got to me in perfect condition amazons the best way to get movies!!!!!
2,The book is much better..............,"Pfeiffer plays a mother who is devastated when her son goes AWOL in a crowd. Nine years later he returns - but is he her real son? Unbelievable coincidences apart, Deep End of the Ocean tries too hard to be faithful to Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-selling source material and winds up falling between more stools than a wino at a Scatologists convention. Pfeiffer, as always, glows."
1,Do not watch this movie-- READ THE BOOK!,The filmakers RUINEDRUINEDRUINEDRUINED a great book by taking out the best parts and changing the real reason Ben's brother was so troubled. Please read the book instead (or at least in addition to) this movie!
2,The Deep End of Movies,"a mostly bad story with plenty of frustration. First off. what mother would ever think of taking three kids to a class reunion, especialy a baby? After ""Ben"" disappears and the remaining family structure falls apart the lead charecter turns to ""super cop"" Whoopi for counciling, ya right.don't bother with this one."
2,"A confusing,thoughless movie","The Deep End Of The Ocean is about a mother who struggles to finding her son after losing him at age 3. For 10 yrs he gone until one day he shows up in mid air. This movie is a satire. It had so many confusing plots, and not much good acting, I wonder where they come up with this stuff. But the ending is so stupid. All I have to say is it's not that intresting or even glancing at it ."
3,Cute but overpriced,"I guess I'm asking for too much when I think it's overpriced. The veggies are stuffed and the pot is plastic. Not that a kid needs a metal pot (ouch if it drops on their foot) but the stuffed veggies are kinda wimpy. The wooden spoon is nice and the timer adds a nice touch even though they don't know what to do with it. My little one thinks the pot makes a nice hat, so I guess it isn't too bad."
1,"weak sequel - plot, characters second to ideas","this was a very weak sequel to the excellent Raven's Shadow. the plot plods. the characters aren't as fun - they are always worrying about each other like an overprotective family. the worst is that the whole second half of the book is heavy on explantions on the 'history' of why this world has Shadowed in it - not interesting, not well thought out, and all teh action stops dead over and over. a real disappointment from an author that can do better.also, 30 pages are missing in the middle of the book, with chapter fifteen repeating instead!"
4,Print is too small!,"I met Patricia Briggs at Necronomicon -- a Science Fiction and Fantasy convention -- in St. Pete Florida a couple of months ago. She and her husband are warm, witty, and fun. Now I have all her other books, and am a FAN! So when I found Raven's Strike at the bookstore, I snatched it up.I'm ordering the prequel, as it is obvious that contains a lot of information that leads up to Raven's Strike.But Patricia -- can't you get your publishers to make the print LARGER?! ""Strike"" might be also called ""Stroke.""Sandy HuffSafety Harbor, FL(Looks like THIS note is in tiny font too)"
5,Excellent sequel to Book 1.,"I don't know if it possible but Patricia Briggs has astounded this reader once again. She has outdone herself with Book 2 of The Raven Duology.Vivid, imaginative, full of mystery, supsense and magic. What more can you ask for?"
4,Enjoyed the book!,"I liked this book. I was afraid it was going to be all about ""SEX with an alien' sort of book but it had a very real story and the way she explored the differences between the 2 peoples worked."
5,The best translation by far,"Arberry's interpretation is both elegant in its expression and quite literal with respect to the original Arabic. The only other translation I would recommend is that of Pickthall, also excellent, but much less readable; in fact, most people I know who started Pickthall gave up on it because the language was so dry and tedious. Arberry's is a work of art by comparison."
4,review,Is this guy ignorant or extremely ignorant (below).Allah is the exact same thing as God. Translated from arabic to english.pride prevents true learning.
4,From the back of the book- caught my attention,"Anna Gertrude Hall was born in the village she has called North Hemlock in this book. Her family moved to California when she was only Two, but her father possessed a rare gift as a storyteller, and the incidents that Cyrus Holt experiences are based on the stories of her father's boyhood during the Civil War days. Miss Hall is a wrote them down as she heard them, but it was not until she found her grandfather's dairies, which supplied chronology and an adult's view of the events, that she was able to put the book together.Miss Hall is a graduate of Stanford University and the New York State Library School. She has organized and directed several libraries over the years......."
5,"gut wrenching, passionate, western, great ending.","this is a book of the old west when women were expected to be prim and proper and the peasants were supposed to be poor. When that line is crossed, a feud begins between business parterns. The one's to suffer, however,are the horses. Great and a must read."
4,Numan Starter Kit?,"Well... I guess this serves as a pretty decent retrospective of Numan's works... although, in my opinion, a little stingy on the Tubeway Army/Telekon era material. Overall, though, not too shabby and better than most thrown-together compilations. Besides, if tracks like ""Bombers"" and ""We are Glass"" don't have you moving like a robot, then maybe you should start your Michael Bolton or Celine Dion collection today, anyway."
4,It would be even better ...,Basically this is a great compilation particularly if like me you remember Cars and Are friends electric ? first being released back in the late 70's and were impressed by the innovative electronic weirdness. Very cool stuff I think and there are a number of other less well known but very good tracks on the CD also. My only dissapointment was that the last track Cars (original release) dosnt play properly. I sent back the first CD and got a replacement but it had the same flaw so I decided to keep it anyway as it has the remix which is very similar.
4,Good overview of Numan's hits,"This is a good overview of Numan's big hit singles, particularly in the UK, in the late 70's and early 80's. My personal favourites are Cars (original version), Are 'Friends' Electric?, White Boys and Heroes, Bombers and This Wreckage. For those who are seeking a collection of Numan songs, this is the ideal album to get."
3,"Good, But Lacking","Where is ""Me, I Disconnect From You""? The best song from Numan's best album, ""Replicas"" should have made the cut!"
5,Nothing else quite like Gris-Gris,"Been collecting albums from this era for about 20 years and don't know how I missed this, until summer 2000 that is.Love it. The vodoo- psychadelica-blues mix is spooky but magnetic. It also dates well, because not many people were using psychadela in this way, so it comes across as strikingly fresh. Frankly, there's not much else I've found that sounds quite like this, and beleive me, I am a hard-core record collector that seeks out underground stuff.I could to an anaylsis of how the album works, but don't want to kill the vibe for you.So, find out for yourself: This is a really great album to play very late at night. It creates such a stange atmosphere, as if Dr John were doing the voodoo rituals right in your living room. Stoned-out, night shift FM DJs in 1968 must have had a ROYAL BLAST with Gris-Gris.Don't buy it if you're looking for anything generic."
4,A cult classic,"If you want to know where ""out there"" is, this is it. A compelling mixture of jazz, funk, voodoo and chemicals. But, to dismiss this as just a piece of strangeness is really missing a large part of why this is special. Listen to the percussion work on I Walk On Guilded Spinter for example, it's certainly noteworthy. There are also numerous places where the other musicians get to shine as well. Everyone in the band is also on the same page here. Having said that, the only remotely marketable cut on here is Mama Roux. As for the rest, well... The fact that this is still available is scary. A 23 year old friend of mine, upon hearing Gris-Gris and Guilded Splinters, told me that I ""need Jesus""! If you want a real dose of the 60's, buy this. There is nothing else quite like it . Just do NOT play this in public, they will throw a net over you."
2,vinyl yes - cd no!,"5 stars for my original vinyl album, which i still play, i am not happy with my newly received cd! as to the album itself & the selections, i love it. however, i dislike the cd quality because it has been produced w/way too much treble. i prefer my very old record & the warmth of sound far more than my brand new cd. to be fair, i normally prefer vinyl to cd sound but my cd leaves a lot to be desired. let's face it, most cd's you buy which weren't even available when an original album was made, are too often little more than bootleg quality buyers are stuck with. in other words-be careful purchasing cd's in general, especially when the cd you purchase is recorded years after a performance only on vinyl was first available. i do own a couple of other dr. john cd's & records, i am a fan & not complaining about their sound quality."
2,MANGLED SCRIPT = MANGLED MOVIE,"THE MANGLER originated in Stephen King's fun short story collection, NIGHT SHIFT. It was brief and to the point. In trying to expand its merits to the screen, director Tobe Hooper finds himself with a mangled script that gets so incoherent, it becomes annoying. Ted Levine is mysteriously miscast in the leading role, and his performance is wooden and uninspired. Even the formidable Robert Englund seems to be playing another Freddy Kreuger. The inclusion of the belladonna is confusing, and the ending where fingers start being lopped off comes out of nowhere.Not one of the best King adaptations to hit the screen, but it IS far better than its ridiculous sequel."
2,A let down.,"When I first saw the peview to The Mangler I am sure that I asking myself why this flim was not more popular. Being it was a Hooper/Englund/King combo I had high expectation for is one.But all this movie turned out to be was a forgetable and weird story of a machine that is eating the factory workers who are working for an old, rich, crazy, guy played by Englund, who owns and love the machine very much even though it is possessed by the devil. The machine also very much injoys 16 year old virgans on their brithdays.The movie gose from good and scary to lame over and over agian in a trend almost. The Mangler also has one of the cheesest screenplays i have ever heard. I will give this movie some props for the great and sinster acting by Robort Englund, and Ted levine."
3,Believe it or not this is a near miss.,"With a great looking mechanical monster and a plot that expands Stephen King's little horror story (but does not adequately explore its expansion), Tobe Hooper's The Mangler is a near miss. The movie needs more than a little editorial tinkering, cutting to be precise. Far too many scenes, if not all of them, run far too long, passing the point taken and are you stretching this boundaries and plunging right into DO SOMETHING ELSE ALREADY territory. Nonetheless, when The Mangler is in action and revealing its demonic personality the movie is, more or less, worth sitting through. Englund is a hoot as well, firmly embracing Vincent Price's lay on the ham with relish acting philosophy. Worth at least one viewing."
3,Surprisingly repulsive,"To disagree with another review of this gory adaption of a King short story, the movie hardly follows the story at all. Sure, the plot elements are the same, but minor details are different. Details just minor enough o affect the outcome of the story. Because there's so many I'll only reveal one: Both the man characters are wifeless. Levine's wife is dead and his pal's a bachelor. Also, Englund' character and the pact he's made with the demon in the machine is different. Englund's character in the book is only mentioned once or twice, and he isn't a main player in the events. Overall repulsive, yet shockingly entertaining. Much like Rob Zombie's: ""House Of 1000 Corpses"". But, what more to expect from the director of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""."
2,TERRIBLE ACTING,"Stephen King is my favorite author and I like his movies too. BUT this movie is his worst. It could be so much better. The plot of it was intresting but with terrible, terrible actors it's slow moving and boring. You lose intrest quick. The book was much, much better."
2,could of been a lot better,this movie had a chance to be a great horror film but didn't quit make it there. it was just an off day film for the whole cast who could of made it a great film
3,This was an alright movie.,"Stephen King could have done so much more with this movie. Most of his books are very well written ,but this one just lacked something that his other books had."
2,From Book to Film. Not a Good Idea,"It could have been a great movie, but its not. It has its good sides, but they are killed by to many bad once. The movie is not saved because they have a horror master like Robert Englind in the lead. The make up was rather OK, but that does not help the film to get good reviews."
2,Three Horror Powers Failed To Live Up To Expectations!,"Stephen King wrote the mini-book. Tobe Hooper (""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") is the director, and it's lead star is none other than horror legend Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger). However, ""The Mangler"" just doesn't deliever. It looks like the budget wasn't much and to be perfectly honest, King's story isn't much, Hooper's direction is uninspired, but Englund has fun with his role as a bitter old man with polo."
1,The Mangler,"I couldnt help but be impressed when I read the all star cast involved in this movie. Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) as director, a Stephen King (The Shining) adaptation, and good 'ol freddy krueger (Robert Englund) as one of the main characters.With these three involved I couldnt help but pick it up and give it a viewing, and get a little excited about watching it.Unfortunately, like a lot of King movies, it falls quite short of being anything special, in fact the end result is rather mediocre considering the players involved.Tobe Hoopers creeping claustrophobia is felt throughout the movie,but wasnt enough to keep the movies head above water.The acting performances were pretty ordinary, but thats almost the norm with horror movies.Of course, Im not going to recommend you buy it, but if you are a fan of Hooper or King, or even England, watch it for there sakes, but dont say I didnt warn you.For you Hooper fans out there, (...)"
4,Freakin' Bloody!,"If you want to see a movie that will scare you and make you sick to your stomach, you have to see this movie! The director was hash to the viewers. It was a good movie with a lot of good effects. Watch it!"
2,This Movie Sure Mangled My Hour And A Half!,"There are only two things that I liked about The Mangler. Those are Robert Englund's twisted performance, and the gore. Everything else about this horror film, from the script to the direction to most of the acting is pretty bad. I don't know how someone goes from directing decent to great movies like Poltergeist, The Funhouse, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to directing crap like this, but Tobe Hooper did it."
5,first class horror with cool twists and turns,"a few really gory bits, but i love well constructed mayhem..... robert englund is classic and shows us that freddy is not his only talent.... stabbings are one thing.... amputations and mangling...... that's the real horror....all i can say is when the detective pukes... i do too lol first class horror and mayhem but with a very intricate plot backing it.... i loved this movie... great characters and great acting if you're a blood and guts guy like me....."
1,I can't believe I watched this all the way through!!!!!,"I can't believe I watched this all the way through!!!!! But at least I didn't buy it, and neither should you!!!!!!I rented it, thinking it would be good, and how can you blame me? It's a film based on a story by STEPHEN KING, directed by TOBE HOOPER, and starring ROBERT ENGLUND. But in n this case, Awesome + Awesome + Awesome = CRAAAAAP!!!!!"
3,A dark movie that will keep you up all night!,"Although the acting in this film was as low budget as the special effects, the story behind the movie was frightening enough to keep me up for a week!!!"
2,not entirely awful,"Since apparently only lunatics are writing reviews of this DVD (not you Johhnykay), I thought I'd better chime in to offer a reasonable voice.First thing: Stephen King has no approval regarding movies like this. He sold off the rights long, long ago, and thus cannot control when and if they get made, much less the quality of the movies.Second thing: this is not a good movie. Don't make the mistake of thinking that it is. The plot is ludicrous -- it sort of works on the page, but filmed, it is just silly. That said, the movie is not entirely worthless. Robert Englund is fun to watch as the factory owner, and there are a few decent sequences. Mainly, though, I'd say the best reason to watch is for Ted Levine, in a rare starring role as the policeman trying to sort this mess out.Just don't think this is any sort of undiscovered masterpiece; it isn't."
2,NO! Robert...How could you do this to me?,"This movie was one of the worst I've seen in this genre. Being a Stephen King and Robert Englund fan, I was not only disgusted but shocked when I rushed to pick up this video 4 years ago. I watched Nightmare on Elm Street for the first time at 4 years old, and it was love at first sight. I've been a blood and guts fan ever since. Robert Englund's acting was a superb additive to King's story. The plot and story line matches the original novel, which is rare with horror movies. However, it just was NOT scary. For God's sake people it's a rusty machine. Get real.Ebony"
4,Mike Hammer Fans Rejoice,"For fans of the old Mickey Spillane books, here is Mike Hammer personified by the unflappable Stacy Keach. Back in the days when men were real men and women were all good looking and ready to jump Mike's bones, Hammer moves through the city like drain-o through a clogged pipe, clearing out the gunky bad guys. Yeah, I know, this applies to all of the Mike Hammer TV series and made for TV movies, but what can I say? I love the guy. For those of you tired of the My Special Effects Are Better Than Your Special Effects one-upmanship of todays senselessly violent mindless entertainment, check out the Good Old Days of a series that aged well. Thumbs up."
3,Help get the 80s show released on DVD,"There are so many versions of Mike Hammer available on DVD, except for the classic 80's show that had a short but great run. Unfortunately it has never seen the light of day on DVD and a lot of people are looking for it.One way to get the ball rolling to get this classic show released onto DVD is to go straight to the source and let them know you want it. Go tohttp://cbs.seenon.com/Scroll to the bottom of the page and under ""About Us"" click on ""product suggestions"" and let them know you want to have the 80's Mike Hammer show on DVD. Consider all the crap that gets released on DVD. This was a great show and Stacy Keach at his best with the character. If they don't know there are people who want it, it won't get released."
5,Wonderful Product!,"My mother has recently been admitted to a skilled nursing facility and I have taken over care of her elderly pug. It was difficult to get Daisy up to see her ""mom"". This product has performed great! The pug loves the stroller! I love that it's lightweight and easy get in and out of the car. The assembly was a little bit tricky for me (but I'm assembly-impaired). Overall, I would highly recommend this product for any pet with health issues or those that get tired mid-way through a walk outdoors."
3,Nice Stroller - Front wheels poorly designed,"This is our second Pet Gear stroller. We bought this one as a replacement to a smaller version.We like the size of this stroller and it fits our two cats with ease. This stroller is also significantly lighter than the smaller stroller it replaced which is a plus.The problem is the front wheels. Pet Gear has gone to a double front wheel on this model stroller which our first thought was great, this ought to steer even easier the the stroller it replaced. Not so. These wheels are very grabby and will shudder periodically while pushing it down a sidwalk or steet.I don't know if others have had the same experience with the front wheels, but hopefully Pet Gear is working on a redesigned front wheel that eliminates the grabbing. We are going to contact Pet Gear to see if there is a replacement wheel they will send us.Had we not experinced this problem, I would have given the stroller 5 stars."
4,Good for taller pet owners.,"I bought this as a replacement for an earlier model Pet Gear stroller. Though they look identical, this newer model is distinctly flimsier, making it harder to steer on soft ground. It's also lighter than its predecessor, but some people might consider that an improvement. It's still an excellent buy for those who walk on paved surfaces. It's also wonderful for taller pet owners; I'm six feet tall, and with other strollers I found I couldn't take a full step without smashing my toes into the rear axles. No such problem with the Happy Trails!"
5,Really great stroller,"Love the stroller. One of my cats looks forward to his walk around the lake. The other is a bit hesitant to be in a contained space, but did pretty well the first time out. Stroller is good quality and it sure does draw attention. I like the idea of letting my indoor cats safely out to see the birds, ducks etc. while being securely confined and protected. Very happy with my purchase."
4,An eye opener!,"An important documentary, it reveals the backatott of judiciary system in America. The medias have never failed to amaze me on how easy to make lights in the unfortunates and deviate the masses from the real issues."
4,A REAL MUST SEE...,"very enlightening, makes one think, makes one question how money and power can and do sway our beliefs. Also, frightening, because corporations DO use their power to effect our thinking and to even go against our best interests. Please, everyone, question everything they present to us..."
5,Thoughtful Documentary,I found this to be a thoughtful and well-done film. I immediately googled Jamie Leigh Jones after watching the film and found a few articles on Mother Jones worth reading - for those of you who already watched the film. Worth watching - as with all documentaries you want to do more research to form a rounded opinion - it's tough to give the whole picture in 1.5 hours.
5,surprisingly great documentary!,"This is a movie that actually changed my mind. As a paramedic, I often felt that lawsuits were mainly people looking for a gold mine. When I heard about the McDonald's coffee case, I thought it was ridiculous. Seeing the actual severe injuries the woman suffered, finding out that this had happened over and over with no remediation by McDonald's, and as the film unfolded learning about other lawsuits and what ""tort reform"" actually is was mind-blowing. My position on this changed 180 degrees. And it was well done, moved fast, and was entertaining. I never felt like I was being educated--it worked as a really strong narrative. I highly recommend this film--I watched it as streaming video, which was good quality, at least on my computer which is where I watch everything."
3,Needed for class,"This movie was easily downloaded and fulfilled a need to view for my civil procedure class.The story was more interesting that I had originally thought. This documentary takes you through the litigation process and defines frivolous lawsuits. The intent of the documentary is to shed light on those that pursue lawsuits not for the money, but for the protection of the consumer."
2,No cream or sugar,The movie is informative of the country's judicial system....but that not what it was presented as. About 15% is about the hot coffee story and the rest about congress and supreme court.
5,Great documentary,This documentary was very interesting and kept my eyes wide open through the whole thing. Make me think more about how I contribute to society and the importance of being well informed of what is taking place around me.
2,Cheaply Built + Mine Was Defective,"The description for this product states heavy gauge steel construction , but this only applies to the top section. The bottom straight section is made of cheap plastic . On top of that , of the 4 holes for the screws to go into mine had 2 of those stripped with a metal backing completely missing on one of them . Even the cheap logo stickers where placed completely off center , though that I could care less about.If I had to do it all over again I would have purchased ""Perfect Pushup"" by Bodyrev which amazon sells ."
2,Poor Quality,It broke within no time. The cheap logo stickers wouldn't even stay on.I do not recommend this product.
1,not available even when in stock!,Tried to buy this 3 times in stock confirmed then cancelled . Bad system....They should not list it in stock when it is not.I had people looking in the mail for the item based on there system.
5,great bookk,great book. perfect for small children. sturdy and in very good condition. my 3yo son loves all the big pictures and really enjoys learning about the fish and how to catch them. he will be a fishing fool in no time!
5,Uncle Bucks Fishing Book,Bought this for my 5 y/o who loves to fish. The whole family has enjoyed the book. Would recommend it to anyone.
5,Can't wait!,"Truly the best season, so many memorable moments! Will order immediately when it is released. Must be the most exiciting finale next to the Season 2 foot race."
5,This was the best season of the entire series!,"This was the very first season I ever watched of ""The Amazing Race"" and I was hooked from the start!It is a very exciting season, but the thing I like most is that the cast is made up of people who seem like REAL, ordinary people you would meet every day. In recent years I have stopped watching the show, because it seems like now they only cast people who look like professional models.This was the very best season, with the most likable and relatable cast the show ever had. (The bowling Moms are still my favorite team EVER!)"
5,Very Soothing,"Second in a series of three discs in ""The Complete Sea"", with words by Rod McKuen, music by Anita Kerr and the San Sebastian Strings. I had the LP set and enjoyed it for years. It appears they were only issued as singles, not a set of three, on CD, so I had to gather them one by one. For some reason, this one seems harder to find, and more expensive. I gave them as a gift to a friend and she loves them. They soothe her to sleep almost every night. The narrator, Jesse Pearson, has a voice that does that, and this time it's a good thing. Rod McKuen has a vocal on only one song, and it is on the companion disc, ""The Soft Sea"". In case you are interested in acquiring a whole set, the first volume is called simply ""The Sea""."
3,"Pretty good plot, not the best writing","I read the book, and enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say Demille is the best writer I ever read, by any means. His jokes are pretty predictable and old."
4,An interesting look into today's army...well thought out.,"I really enjoyed the characters, their emotions and thoughts...they had dimension and depth. I would recommend to friends. I would like to read more by this author."
2,Formula writing,"Is there a formula going on here? I mean, this stuff was pretty predictable if you have ever read a ""who dunnit"" or seen a murder mystery movie. Loved the wise cracks, though, they really saved the book. Read it, but don't expect a ""OHHH"" at the end, just don't expect it."
2,"Deviant sex, cliched military characters douse story","Having heard the new movie was disgusting in its portrayal of certain parts of ""The General's Daughter,"" I decided to listen to the audiobook instead. Why an author would choose to focus much of his story on deviant sexual practices is beyond me. Is it supposed to titillate me? It's disgusting. The who-done-it aspect of the story is somewhat interesting, but when the murderer was revealed, I had a hard time remembering who this character was. In an audiobook you can't flip back a few pages to make sure you remember who this and that character is and I'm afraid I had to listen again to the first side of the tape to understand better what had happened. I also didn't find the interaction between the two principal detectives particularly believable."
3,A premise which strains credibility.,"While sufficiently interesting, the story's basic premise was so absurd that it was hard for me to enjoy the good writing. A famous general's daughter manages to seduce everyone in sight (even the chaplain, for shame!) and manipulate them at will. And then it gets silly. I realize this book has been well received, but for the life of me I have no idea why"
4,Demille at his finest.,"Having seen the movie before reading the book helped me to visualize the scenes. Demille is a master of dialogue and character development; it doesn't matter what the topic, I love reading the books."
4,Demille at his best!,This story was fast paced and a great read. All the characters were flawed and through each one you see what lies within the darkest part of the human mind and heart and its consequences. Brenner is very likeable and his sarcastic wit shines through.
3,"Better than the movie, but still brain candy","I try not to read mysteries when I know who the murderer is, because it usually ruins the book. However, the movie version of ""The General's Daughter"" is different enough from the book in terms of characterization, suspense, and relationships that I enjoyed the book *after* the movie. Masterpiece Theater it ain't. But not bad for something to read on the plane."
4,Forget the movie; book is far superior,"This is a griping tale of the military, power, crime and the criminal justice system all rolled up into one memorable book. The characters are ones that the author makes the reader care about right from the onset. It is a large book but it is a fast read page-turner."
3,"If you like straightforward, no nonsense psychological","drama, you'll like this book. If you like feeling as if you're riding around in the back of a cop car, searching for the ""bad guys"" you'll like this book. I did."
5,Excellent! If the movie is as good as book it will be a Hit,I have yet to read or listen to a Nelson DeMille book and not like it... I can't wait to see the movie looks like a top notch production...
1,offensively unrealistic,"I would hope that an author gets the facts down before writing about West Point. I found the premise of his storyline beyond believability, even insulting to the reputation of the institution of the United States Military Academy. There's fiction and then there's absurdness. This author, unfortunately, has not weaved a level of reality into this work."
2,Disappointing Demille,"This Demille thriller seemed to get lost in typical bureaucratic red tape. Too many characters, not enough plot. One dead daughter & all her sexual conquests. Strangely this is the one they made into a movie. Read ""Spencerville"", ""Plum Island"", or ""The Gold Coast"" for true Demille devilish pleasure."
4,"A quick, entertaining read.","Interesting from the very beginning, this book has several twists and turns. With witty dialogue and likable characters the pages turn all too quickly."
5,The book's better than the movie,"I've read just about everything DeMille's written, and he's never failed to entertain me completely. Saw this movie years ago, and decided to go back recently to read the book; he was...and is one of the best story tellers I've had the pleasure to read. For those DeMille fans who have only seen the movie years ago...do yourself a favor and read the boo."
4,The General's Daughter by DeMille,This is a well developed fast moving novel by one of Americans best. The intrigue that surrounds what appears to be a rape/murder reaches to the core of the American military.
4,"Good plot, great characterizations","This was the first Nelso Demille book I've read and I guess it won't be the last. I wasn't sure what to expect but discovered a cleverly written, well plotted story of the search for the killer of a General's daughter. And I was as involved as the investigators in trying to find the truth and discount the lies.The characterizations were brilliant, mostly through the dialog between Paul Brenner (sleuth extraordinaire) and Cynthia Sunhill (sleuthess extraordinaire)! Their own love-hate relationship kept alive many of the flatter parts of the story. The suspense was built by there being a deadline on the investigation, and I admit that I hadn't puzzled out the culprit until it was exposed in the story.Nothing too cerebral, but a good book for easy reading."
3,Where was the editor,"I thought the movie was excellent. I thought the audio tape was also excellent. The book needed a good editor to cut out some of the deadwood. I got bored and lost interest. I had to push myself to finish the book. I simply got bogged down in places. However, I thought the story line was excellent and made one of the best movies of the year. I'm not sure I want to read any more of the author's books, but I'd buy abridged tapes of his books anytime they are available."
4,The General's Daughter,"I thought it was exciting. It moved right along, Always had a surprise.It had suspense right up till the end."
5,Nelson DeMille's General's Daughter,"The book was in excellent condition when it arrived, not that I had doubts. I am a DeMille fan and would purchase his or any other books through Amazon because they are all I hope for at a sensible price and they ship in a very timely manner. Customer Service is excellent."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I find this book to be ""EXCELLENT"" I was not able to put it down from the begining to the end. This was the first book I have ever read by Mr.DeMILLE, but I'm looking forward to the next one."
5,General's Daughter,"Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite authors and I have loved each one. Nelson developes the characters so you can feel their emotions,you feel like you are on the scene and viewing it first hand. Great, Great Author."
1,The General's Daughter,"This book is riddled with factual errors and a fanciful depiction of military life that should have been corrected by an author who served, however briefly, in the army."
4,I couldn't put it down.,"While I liked the story and just had to keep reading to find out why did all this happen, I also found myself thinking ... there are more villians here than the usual story provides. The investigator showed a lot of promise but seemed to blow it as a romantic ""go get her"". That was part of his character though. The story had so many tragic loose ends to it. So many loved and hated her for who she was and she just wanted justice and to have her father show he cared more for her than anything else. The movie was very good after reading this book."
2,Predictable,"This is a story of a death of a female military officer. And the motive is that she was trying desperate to get the attention of her father, who is a general, at the same military installation.While I found the book interesting, I found that the story was better as a movie.But, if you are looking for a book that is really a light read, this is an excellent book."
3,"Good mystery with twists, good for summer read.","This book is good summer read, by the way, there is no such word as absurdness. Probably not a book to be taken so seriously. Liked Gold Coast better"
4,Relentless suspense,"THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER is an outstanding novel, every bit as fast paced and spellbinding as THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, as suspenseful as any of Stephen King's best thrillers, and to top it off, stylishly written and very well plotted."
5,One great summer read!,"I've been a Nelson DeMille fan since his potboiler men's adventure paperback days of the early 70s. This is his best ever. Smart cocky hero, smart sexy heroine and a mystery plot that kept me going from page one. I took this on a late spring vacation and it was impossible to put down. Although I don't think of DeMille as a mystery writer, the plot and solution to this one put him right up there with the masters of mystery writing. Tough, sexy and tightly plotted--this is everything you look for in a great story by a master of suspense."
5,Compelling and full of DeMille humour.,"I picked up this book after reading Plum Island and Spencerville. I was not sure I would enjoy the book as much as the first two I had read, due on the most part to the fact that the drama was set within the military confines of an army base in the Southern United States. However, I need not have worried. This is in fact the best DeMille novel I have read to date. The main character Paul Brenner allows DeMille to again share with us his great sense of humour, which captivates from begining to end. Brenner is a similar character to the one we were introduced to in Plum Island, and although the setting is different the plot takes the same twists and turns, while compelling the reader to turn the pages. DeMilles' understanding of how a 'cop' thinks, acts and investigates is first rate whether in the military or on Long Island. If this is the first DeMille you have read I will guarantee it won't be your last, if it's not the first it won't disapoint."
4,well worth buying,"Draws the reader into De Mille's millitary world while being very easy to read and absorb.I saw the film first so was anxious to see how close book and film were. I need not have worried. Apart from a few minor details film was faithful to the book.Book filled in the detail and gaps that film left out.Lighter than a Tom Clancy novel, yet gritty enough for any avid reader to really sink their teeth into.Author's introduction and experience of the film adaptation was a nice touch while also being informative. All in all highly recommended"
1,SADLY...IT DOESN'T WORK,"I tried to prank a friend on a flight halfway across the country with this ""fart candy,"" thinking what better way to use this joke than on a crowded plane. I tested it on myself first a few days before the flight and after 8 hours I had farted only once which is much less than normal for me. I tried it on my friend and his wife for an entire weekend anyway to no avail. Great idea, but it doesn't deliver."
5,great read!,"I am absolutely enthralled with this series, love reading them and can't wait to read the next. I'll be sad when I'm finished."
1,"Very, boring, failed attempt at humor.","I agree with a reviewer who wrote about one of the other ""Miss Julia"" books that the housekeeper sounds like a character out of ""Gone with the Wind."" I found it to be very demeaning for her housekeeper to talk like she did, and to hover over Miss Julia in such a demeaning way (to the housekeeper.)Also, one irritating thing that occurs in the book and in my opinion takes up a large portion of the book as filler is:Something happens, then Miss Julia or another character repeats itto several other characters.The first few times I thought it was maybe a device that would be rare, but I noticed it was done throughout the book many times. If these instances were removed from the book, it would be very slim indeed.It made it very boring and hard to read.I wouldn't suggest this book for anyone."
4,Scandal in a small southern town,"This is my first ""Miss Julia"" book and I found it quite delightful. The book is all about small-town life in the South and is a tongue-in-cheek look at the attitude that appearances are everything. Miss Julia is approached by Dwayne Dooley who wants to lease some land that she owns in order to build a Walk Where Jesus Walked theme park. Although her Presbyterian sensibilities are riled by the thought of commercializing Christianity, Miss Julia agrees that this is a good business deal and decides to go through with it. Meanwhile, scandals abound as several prominent citizens are observed in highly questionable situations and the women of the town are quite happy to jump to all sorts of nefarious conclusions. Added to this, Miss Julia's boyfriend Sam Murdoch tries his best to convince her to marry him. It's all in good fun and makes for an enjoyable read."
5,Get Ready for Kindergarten,"Cute, entertaining and educational. All in all a good way to get your child ready for Kindergarten."
5,Getting Ready for Kindergarten,"My three year old ask to look at the Kindergarten movie every day....He loves it, and was singing along with all the songs within a week of purchasing it."
2,Lousy picture quality,The music is great but the picture quality is lousy. It might be Ok on a small screen but but on a projector screen it fails miserably.
4,History up close,"Erickson demonstrates her profound knowledge of the Tudor era in England through the amazing variety of details she fits into her easy and engaging narrative of the life of one of England's most loved but notorious kings. The reader learns about the perosn, the monarch, his family and his country, and how all were intertwined. The development of Henry, second son not meant to inherit the throne, into Great Harry, fearless and fearsome king who practically destroyed his kingdom to get his own way are beautifully chronicled and bristles with personal touches. It's high drama and well worth it."
1,"BERLIN, rough guide.","This book is very biased. It does not deal with the post war history of Berlin at all well. It will not meet the needs of any visitor to Berlin who wants to see the sights and sounds of the old east. This is a great pitty, because this is one of the most interesting and unique features of Berlin - a place where East and West met head on. The book has such a strong pro US stance that I am left wondering if it might have been written by the CIA."
1,Useless. Chews up the siding and cuts are messy,"Using the circular saw with a special blade was dusty, so we tried these shears and another brand. The shears sucked by comparison. The shears chew up the siding so much that every cut has to be cleaned up, wasting time. My advice is to use a circular saw with a fiber cement blade and wear a dust mask -- you will get clean cuts and go much more quickly. I wish I could return the shears."
5,Spectacular,"I had never heard of Hello Dave when a dear friend of mine moved from the Windy City to Palm Springs. When she said it was her favorite band, I hadn't a clue. One listen to this CD and I was hooked. Highlights for me include ""Broken,"" ""Saturnalia,"" ""Melissa,"" and ""Biminy."" Spectacular CD. There's nothing else to say."
1,"Incomplete, and boring.","I am a big George Lopez fan and, as a result, my daughter gave me this book as a gift. I deeply admired the man for what he has accomplished, but found this book uninspiring. The only ""kick"" I got out of it was that his biological father might have the same last name as me. Other than that, it is not worth the read, particularly if you have followed his progress over the years. His stand-up comedy video pretty much tells you how hew grew up."
2,Unfortunate,"I'd heard good reviews of Mad Sin, so I decided to check out this album... Boy do I regret that. I am a fan of psychobilly, and this is far from it. It sounds like a horrible, poppy mix of Sum 41, AFI, hard rock and some kind of drunk pirate. It has its moments, but I would stay away from this one unless you are a real fan. I did get ""God Save The Sin"", which is an impressive release from these guys. I would reccommend that one instead, especially if you're an actual psycho fan. I guess if you are a fan of more mainstream music this could be for you. I can imagine songs from this CD being played on the alternative radio station..."
3,Problems in mixed linux/windows environments,"I have 5 of these devices, and I have some issues in mixed Linux/Windows environments. The ones that I have that work well are all hooked to all windows machines, or all linux machines. But when I mix them, I run into lots of problems with the KVMs (and hence the USB mouse/keyboard) being recognized by the host computers."
2,haphazard and incomplete,This must have been written in a hurry. The list of trees is incomplete to the extreme and the information is scattered throughout the book. I wish I hadn't paid $ 30 for this.
3,Stormscaping,"Reviews the safety of planting the more common trees Florida, relative to their stability in windstorms. The information is valuble but restricted to a relatively small group of trees. The pertinent details are backed up with examples and pictures."
4,Cute cookie cutter,"Good quality cutter, purchased for a medieval kids event, a cookie decorating contest. I would have rated a 5 if a little bit bigger and a less cartoon-y shape, but it was the only one I could find under $12!"
2,"It's an OK watch... nothing ""Glamorific""","I'll be short and sweet, but to the point. The watch in a nutshell is alright in terms of uniqueness... however, it has poor quality! the Glass covering ---easily--- gets smudged, fogged, and scratched. I bought this watch 3 months now and it's already accumulated the 3 MAJOR setbacks listed above. In addition, the [pin] that holds the band together sucks!!!!!!!!!! i was washing my clothes 2 weeks in wearing it, and it was etched slightly as i was feeding clothes in the machine and broke off. I spoke to customer service for a replacement. They were mean and unhelpful and told me >>>that's my problem<<< and that the only way to fix it is to pay for a new pin which cost $7.89. so no! don't get this watch! it's not all that. I haven't even receive 1 compliment from it w/in the 3 months upon purchase. lol."
5,A Repeat Customer,"Purchased my first Skagen almost five years ago and just replaced the original battery. It took a day or two to get used to the clasp. Note, the stainless steel band is ideal for our hot and humid climate in Florida.I'm buying this new model with a black and white face because of my problem is reading the watch dial in low light. I recommend the Skagen watch with the mesh band without reservation based on my good experience with my first Skagen watch. Its a fine product at an outstanding price from Amazon."
5,Slim Watch - Great Price!,"Received this watch as a gift, and I now absolutely love Skagen watches.A real sleek looking watch, elegant design.Mesh strap is much stronger than it looks."
3,"Tremendous power, BUT!","The P-C 2611 is a very strong drill and has demonstrated it's willingness to bore through various materials with vigor. However, this is supposed to be a variable speed drill and it has so little feel or touch at slow speed that I had the trigger switch replaced by a P-C authorized service center. No difference. Trying to use it as a driver is frustrating as it's too difficult to develop and maintain a controlled speed appropriate for driving screws. Lots of willing power for drilling but if I were just using it to drill I would have bought the 1/2"". Weight is well balanced and of course construction is top notch."
2,fail,"I got this product a few weeks ago and thought it was really good, it was a good length for me [I am 5'4] but it would be good for someone taller also. I used it outside in the park about 6-8 times about 30 minutes each time.Yesterday the rope tore on the part where it was connected to the handle, because the rope turnes through the handle when jumping and the abrasion broke the rope. I pulled the rope through the handle and tied a knot so it is still useable just shorter but now it it does not spin through the handle on the side with the knot and it tangles the rope as I jump."
1,SPRI Pro Line Speed Rope,"I am 183cm tall (6ft) I bought this rope believing it would be long enough for a 6ft person to use comfortably - WRONG!!If your 5ft 9 inches or taller forget it, you'll be forever whacking yourself in the back of the head. For me its rubbish really - look elsewhere."
3,"The Sonics and ""The Sonics""","After their third album (Introducing The Sonics), the original line-up split, and a band that was The Sonics in name only kept on going for the rest of the 1960s. This is a great collection that contains all of Introducing The Sonics (tracks 1-15) and then everything else that ""The Sonics"" recorded. So the first 15 tracks are all that fans should want; the rest is only for serious fans and/or the very curious."
4,Hardkandy - How Do You Do Nothing?,"Warm and full of easygoing vibes, Hardkandy's debut, HOW DO YOU DO NOTHING? kicks off with ""Summer of '95,"" which suggests summer in its reggae off-beat and swimming strings that segue into funk, and the mellowness continues into ""Big Sand."" ""Funny Thing"" which melds its horns and beats into a fine paste of funk, and ""Booty Theme"" starts off sounding like something out of a cop show, but settles into its groove. ""To Lose"" is a moodier piece, drawn out and with a lingering sadness to it, like watching your loved one leave on a boat, while ""Moonlight"" brings the love back, with romance to spare, courtesy Jessie Banks (from the band Chungking). ""Ultraviolet"" sounds like someone lying on the beach and staring into the stars, while ""Standstill"" brings back the strings and Jessie Banks. Rarely has doing nothing sounded so good."
2,for new teachers,MAterial in this book was prety much everything a veteran teacher does. Book is good for first year teachers
2,Borrow someone else's copy,"If you are completely new to the world of teaching, or someone gave you the book for free, it would be worth reading. Otherwise, spend the twenty dollars on another book written by someone with more than seven years of teaching experience at the first grade level. It has some good activities, but not enough to make it worth it."
2,Torture For The Viewer Times Three.,"I must admit, when Amazon announced the release of this set I was enthused, having seen 'Women In Cell Block 7' in a grindhouse theater when I was a teen. Propped-up as great exploitation in the product details, I purchased it almost immediately (at least I got it from a secondary seller and didn`t pay Amazon pricing, thankfully). Unfortunately, the 3 films come from a wretched source, all the colors bleed and/or are washed out, creating an almost hot orange haze throughout, the films are edited/hacked to pieces, and all are poorly, annoyingly dubbed, resulting in an abyssmal viewing experience, even w/ the fast-forward button engaged. `Felt like I was the one imprisoned ... look elsewhere for your WIP kicks, you won`t find them here."
5,Best Recipe Book,This is the best cook book ever. I have made many recipes from it with excellent results.
4,review,This show is getting very wierd. I am about half way through the season. Im still hooked and want to know what happens but it is starting to get a little to far fetched.
3,Not my favorite season,I have thoroughly enjoyed the Weeds series up to this season. They are moving around a lot & not following the norm. I will continue watching & hope the next season can wrap up all the loose ends.
2,Series slides further; don't waste your time,"This show is at best a pale imitation of what it was in its first three seasons. I guess I want to see how Nancy Botwin's tale ends, but I would have been so much more satisfied if this show had wrapped up after a two or three-year run. Season 5 still has some funny moments, mostly propelled by the dry, wry Mexicans Nancy is forced to deal with, but the initial charm of the show is well and truly lost. Maybe Weeds is a little bit like what I'm told using drugs is like: it's very easy to get hooked, but after years of use you're embarrassed and ashamed and wished you were clean.The old devices are wearing thin: Silas does something stupid, Shane broods, Nancy sleeps with somebody to get everyone out of a jam. This show used to be one on TVs best and it used to be one of TVs funniest--it has morphed into a forgettable soap."
5,More addictive than ever,Fantastic series! Just when you think it couldn't get anymore crazy it does. Love it!
2,Bad copy,The second disc in the set of three does not play on the dvd player. It must be a bad copy.I never had a problem with anything before though.The series is great.
2,disc broken,"The second disc doesnt work at all. Disc one and three work perfectly, im not satisfied though. I think the disc cracked just a little when the manufacturer placed it in the box."
5,Gripping series,"We didn't think we would like a series about drugs, but it funny and suspenseful. The characters are people you can relate with."
4,Almost Perfect,"Great transaction, great video! The only problem I had was with one episode. It kept ""breaking up"" and I was unable to tell what was going on, and could not hear anything. The other episodes were all fine. Otherwise, this season was as GREAT as the other seasons!"
3,Good Show - Poor DVD Quality,"This is a good show, however I received a defective DVD. The second DVD would not play all of the episodes."
5,Skewed humor,"I suggest if you like this show or have just discovered it buy the set of 1st 5 seasons. Well drawn characters, actors very appropriate for their roles. This show is pervertedly funny. Comedy equivalent to Seinfield. Good dvd's with no technical glitches."
1,"Yet Another, Season 5 Disc 2 Victim - Disc Unreadable","I'm another victim of the poorly pressed disc #2. Anyone who buys this should check disc 2 to make sure it reads. They should do this a quickly as possible to make sure they can return their set, if they end up a victim. I highly recommend not buying this as a gift for anyone. No one is going to like getting a bad dvd set. Definitely not for Christmas!!!"
3,Down Hill but Still Fun,"Short as ever (only 12 episodes) and more implausible by the moment, the show still manages to produce some decent laughs, but has been nothing like the high ;) it started on. Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker) and Doug Wilson (Kevin Nealon) continue to be the main reason to watch. The youngest son, Andy, is becoming more interesting though.Overall, this is a Netflix or other rental. The money to purchase these DVDs can give you a whole month of new stuff, rather than just a few nights of Weeds."
3,Awesome seller - DVD IN questionable condition.,"Seller was awesome, understanding, prompt, and quick to refund my money. That is when i informed him (rather irritated) that disc 1 would not play. This is an ongoing issue with my Weeds DVDS I AM TRYING TO OBTAIN. I purchase a season, brand new sometimes, and episodes refuse to play/skip. THIS IS NOT FAIR TO THE CONSUMER & something should be done. Otherwise excellent seller and i would purchase from him again."
5,Excellent condition,"When I ordered online, I never knew if the case of Weeds season 5 was old or new, so when I received it, I was impressed that case was brand new!"
2,"Bad Disk 2 on blu ray edition Season 5, Anyone Else","I agree with some others that seasons 4 & 5 just don't hold up to the first 3. For me that is a good thing. Disk 2 didn't even attempt to play. The message shown says can't play disk, no data found. It does the same on my computer. It is not damaged in any visable manner. I have never had a new disk fail like this. Only the ones I rent ! I can't exchange and I am not wasting another 25.00 on a dvd that the first disk was minimum at best and I doubt very seriously that disc 2 gets so much better to be worth 25.00. I will rent it eventually.Did anyone else experience disk 2 failure ?"
4,awesome,"really enjoy this series and i own all of them, this latest purchase arrived very fast. thanks"
4,Not so silly any more,"This season shows the Nancy Botwin continuing in her self-destructive life-style and slowly bringing her family down with her. It has the usual escapism and Kevin Neelon et al are their usual absurdist best. By the end of the season though, it's hard to have any sympathy for the situation in which Nancy finds herself; no longer is she our favorite pot dealing suburban mother, but a true drug lord's wife."
2,Awful,". This series was so good in the first 2 seasons and then it started going downhill. The characters get more and more unwatchable with each new season..to the point of my actually wanting something bad to happen to all of them..and for me to like a series there has to be characters that I root for. I should say that while this episode was bad, Season 6 was even worse..so bad that I couldn't even watch all of it. There were so many other directions that they could have gone with this story..I think it could have been great."
1,NO response from seller and 20 days to deliver???,DVD estamted time of delivery by seller was 20 days by US post office??? 20 days? I emailed seller twice now and no response. This is unacceptable.
1,Again another hot cover but,"This series should have stopped with the season before this one. This installment of the series was just getting kinda pointless. The characters are kinda one dimensional, and they try to make it dramatic and real to life but they fall short.Save your money and get something more valuable. Again the cover is cute but thats about it."
3,Bonus feature glitch,"Its possible I got a defective set and this problem doesn't exist with all copies. Its also possible my $150 Blu-Ray player is to blame, but in the disc 2 bonus feature ""University of Andy"" segment ""satisfying a woman"", the audio and video are wildy out of sync, and it plays like a poorly buffered YouTube video. Does anyone else have this problem? I can't seem to find any other mention of this issue on any other review boards."
1,"""Weeds. Burned out in Season 5""","Briefly, I thought the show took a very weird turn. They must have run out of ideas to make such radical changes. I found the stories unpleasant, some characters despicable, and felt all the regular cast became obnoxious and unlikeable - especially Nancy. After ""being in love"" with Mary Louise for a few years I felt totally the opposite. There was no way she should have even been nominated for an Emmy, let alone win it. And she had the nerveto ask on Twitter, ""Who Thought I Should Have Won the Emmy Last Night?"" I bought two copies of the first four seasons. This is the first season that I will not even buy one. It's unfortunate that Jenji and the writers had to ruin a Great Show."
1,"Get Season One ONLY, Don't Bother With The Rest.","This show had promise when it first aired, and I still watch Season 1 on a regular basis.But then it got too violent, everybody got arrested, and they all ran down to Mexico. That's when this series went downhill and they lost me.I did buy Season 2 and watched it once. It's not on my repeat list.For a series about marijuana, they don't have much of it.A disappointing run for a series that had potential in the first few episodes.I think they fired all the pothead writers and replaced them with meth-heads."
4,"Amazing show, amazing season","Nancy has become abit of a wanker, hense why its missing just one star, but the humour is still as great as ever, if not better, the REST of the characters are developping into interesting fun people, and im loving where the show is headed.Cant wait for season 6."
2,A Gradually Disappointing Series,"After watching Season 1 & 2 and possibly Season 3, I thought this show offered a undemanding but well-written comedy with just the right touches of humanity. It actually bothered me that its simplicity kept me wanting more. But half way through Season 3, I realized this series was spiraling into just another hypnotic search for humor and the show really needed to end. Weeds, perferably would have ended on a good accord and not accede into a slow death. Season 5 is that slow death. As long as viewers habitually watch, whether good or bad, writers will dig for material, sadly it's not the characters but the script that's terminal. This series is far removed from it's original content. Lay this down in the graveyard of over-run shows starting with Season 4 and death with 5. Don't expect resurrection on 6. Mary-Louise Parker is still awesomely adorable!"
4,A New Patton with Hitlerian Dreams,"Martin Stone, a survivor of WW3, finds himself in boot camp with the New American Army led by Gen. George Patton III. After a few missions with the army, Stone finds that the general has plans to make himself dictator of a revived America. This is an exciting adventure in a Postwar world that is not inhabited by mutant monsters or genetic freaks. Craig Sargeant's series offers a chillingly realistice America after the ultimate disaster."
3,A little out of date now.,"I picked this up about ten years ago, and at that stage it was a little out of date, especially the section on windsurfing. It is a reasonable text book for sailing all the same, and it covers the basics well. If you are starting out or if you are trying to improve your technical skills you could do worse than to use this. It is certainly more accessible that heavy texts such as the Glenans sailing handbook. It is well illustrated and well laid out. Worth buying if you get a bargain!"
5,Superb acting,"Ok...think AL Pacino at his best. Multiply it by like 10,000 and you have his acting performance. The scene where he tries to commit suicide still gives me goosebumps.Add to that, great supporting acting, a fantastic script which is quite funny at times and very moving also and you have yourself a superb film.Go get it."
5,WOW... Some movies have a big heart... and this one sure does.,I don't want to go into the story.What makes a story and a movie awesome is heart. Something that hits deep into your soul. A story that underlines morality and emphasizes virtues with a touch of class.This one sure does that.Wish Hollywood would have the temerity and courage to invest in making more movies such as this. It's a rare gem of a movie.
5,Awesome HD DVD,Scent of a woman is worth every penny on HD DVD. Al pacino's winning oscar role is one or his best movie role to date. I highly recommand buying this dvd on high def. you will not be disappointed.
3,Good Movie but drags on a little too long,"The charsimatic Al Pacino plays Frank Slade,a blind hot tempered vietnam vet who is befriended by a college student Charlie, played by Chris o`Donnell When Charlie needs some extra cash to go home for the hollidays he takes on a job taking care of Frank but not realizing what he`s in for. Frank takes Charlie on a trip to New York and the two men become the closet of friends. A different turn on the father and son thing and Pacino did a good job in trying to get his character across but it took too long over 2 hours to end a film of this rather unexplored subject and it was unnesscary. Al Pacino won the Oscar for this role but in my mind it should of gone to Clint Eastwood for UNFORGIVEN relaesed that same year."
5,Scent of a Woman,Excellent movie! Not a chick flick - great for both men and women. Highly recommend this movie.
5,Powerful and Funny,"This movie is amazing. It makes you laugh, makes you cry, and it makes you want to stand up and cheer. Al Pacino plays one of his best roles ever in playing the Colonel. The message of acceptance and belonging are shouted from the rooftops in this film. It shows you how people in different places in their life are still essentially making the same choices. If you liked Dead Poets Society or Finding Forrester you will love this film."
4,A delight to watch.,"Mr. Pacino, who has not been a favorite actor of mine, gives a powerful and compelling display of his acting abilities as a blind, embittered, retired army officer bent on destroying himself. Chris O'Donnel also shines in his role of the young student weighed down by a decision he must make which could destroy his future. The two spend an upsetting, uplifting, emotional Thanksgiving weekend together which ultimately leads to a very satisfying conclusion. Truly a delight to watch."
5,Great,I loved the movie. Never really heard of this movie till my teacher suggested it Al Pacino plays a good part.
5,Al Pacino is the best actor born EVER,Theres nothing like this movie EVER made. And an actor like Al Pacino is born once in milleniums.
2,"Pachino's ok, but is this anything we haven't already seen?","Great, another Hollywood redemption flick. Veteran Pachino gives his standard good performance, but O'Donnell is a snivelling, whiney, no guts loser. Only out of pity did Pachino come through for this guy. Alot of hype for this film, and it didn't come close. C'mon guys, I know you can do better."
2,dissapointed,Thought I was getting closed captioned. It was not. Sound was very low. Had to turn speaker almost all way up.
5,If it was not for The Soup Nazi Episode......,"I would have never wanted to watch this movie!!!! I had to know what Elaine was talking about with the ""Hoo Wah...Hoo Wah"" talk. OUTSTANDING MOVIE!!! I know that some of Pacino's Quotes will surface in future conversations I will have. If you have not viewed this movie....Do yourself a favor and go ahead and buy it because you will want to if you just rent it."
5,i love this film so damn much,when i first heard this film i thought it was gonna be a chick flick but after the 1st 10mins i was drawn into this film my eyes never left the screen. i love how this film has more then one plot. you have to love the speech at the end that pacino gives at the school on behave of charlie. there alone pacino nailed that oscar
5,Great movie,"For me the best movie I have ever seen since it goes beyond the usual shallowness of regular pictures, and characters have great complexity. You won't get dissapointed! Worth watching many many times, and enjoy all those times."
2,Boring,This movie is for you if you want to waste your time watching two people talking for over two hours. I can't even begin to explain how boring this movie is.
1,not my type of movie..,"I got this movie because I wanted to see the role in which Gabrielle Anwar is apparently famous for. Im probably the only one who would do that but I did, and maybe thats why it was a major let down. She was a pretty insignificant character to the movie and her scene lasted at most five minutes. The movie itself was for lack of a better description very 'movie like'. Al Pacino is a bitter old blind soldier who is trying to fulfill his last wishes and live it up in the big city before his planned suicide. Again this is just me but overall it was a dissapointment. I have yet to be impressed with Mr. Al Pacino."
2,Very Average&overrated,I have dug Al Pacino for a long time but he has made a lot of clunkers over the past decade and this falls into that pile.he shouldn't have won over Denzel for this Performance period.this film is pretty flat.and as far as playing a blind role check out Gene Wilder in see no evil hear no evil.far more convincing than Pacino.as for Chris O'Donnell he should be working at a Hot Dog stand somewhere.he can't act at all.
4,pacino is amazing,"i held off for a long time on watching this movie because i expected to be overly-emotional mushy drivel. instead, it's hilarious (a blind pacino racing a ferrari around NYC) and very watchable. pacino is wonderful to watch- he's truly one of the greatest actors ever."
4,Comfortably predictable and worth the final monologue.,A feel good movie for both men and women. Pacino looks like he's having a blast while Chris O'Donnel looks appropriately intimidated. Late night holiday viewing for my family each Christmas season after the kids are off to bed.
5,Scent of a Woman [HD DVD],The quality of my purchase is excellent and I am very pleased to have bought this through Amazon. The delivery was speedy and efficient as well [truth be told I was very anxious to watch it and it exceeded my expectations]!
5,"A romantic movie for those of us who aren't ""romantics""","I am NOT a fan of Hallmark or Lifetimes movies, romance novels or ""bodice-rippers"". This movie, however, knocks my socks off! Yes it's cliche to mention by now, but the tango scene has got to be one of the BEST dance scenes ever filmed. Lovely...absolutely lovely. Oh to be young, willowy, smartly dressed and able to tango with an elegant man like Mr Pacino! And then to watch Charlie stand up to the old boy's club with the stirring defence of Lt Col Slade...LOVE IT!"
4,"A funny light hearted film, that will make you laugh",I saw this movie in the movie theater and I thought it was even better on video. A great movie to watch when you want a litte motivation and have time to laugh. Take a break and enjoy Al's acting.
5,Superb movie,"I had seen it when it first came out, so I knew what I was getting.May be one of Pacino'e best. Such a smart movie. My two favorite parts are1) racing the Lamborgini2) defending Charlie at the disciplinary hearing."
4,KJJO remembered,"Tommy and Amy, of the Mags, were good friends of KJJO 104.1 in those days and their support of each other is appreciated by those of us who love the alt movement in whatever era or plane of existence. I have recordings of the last days of KJJO before it was taken over by the National Socialist Neo cons of corporate country radio, (KBOB 104!!), which lasted not so long, but those last nights of KJJO in Mpls MN back in 1993 will live in this listeners head till I am laid to rest. Years from now the voices of Steven, Shelley, Robin, BT, the Lightning Cow, Mad Mike, etc., will echo from my head stone.Long live Mags,Long live KJJO. Goodnight, God bless."
4,Bought for myself,"I bought this for my boyfriend 3 and a half years ago, I bought two rings as I wasn't sure what the size they were on here, you know if one ring seemed too small I'd keep it and give the other one. This was the small ring, it could fit a woman or a really young guy with small fingers. The picture is hard to see as it's bright but it looks pretty cool in person, even with that flower design. The dragon looks good, I loved it, wish it had more bolts though, then the set of two. They came loose after like half a year or so. but you can get new bolts put in, I did in jewelry class, and the ring fit way better after that, more snug and moveable, not tiny bit loose and kind of falling away from finger."
1,Hard Drive Failure less than 12 months,"Purchased as a back up for my MacBook Pro. Reformatting the hard drive was required to use with the Mac. The process was time consuming but painless and was able to connect (wireless) the drive via the Airport Extreme.Within 10 months of the purchase, the hard drive failed. The data was recovered after paying a data recovering company $400."
1,Had to Send it back twice,First one that sent would not even power up. I sent it back and the second one they sent also would not power up. It's possible that it really isn't compatible with my Intel-Mac the way it says it is-- but I'm sticking to Lacie in the future.
4,A solid backup drive,"I have been backing up my computer for 15 years. I ahave always used either Western Digital or Maxtor products. I have been very satisfied with this drive.The only issue I have is that the Retrospect software bundled with the product does not work. If not for this issue, I would have given 5 stars."
1,Power Problems,"This drive may be excellent. I'll never know. I have now gone through two of them.The first one let out a loud pop and started smoking after being connected to power. It was plugged into a power strip that has no problems with any other equipment. Thank goodness it didn't take my iMac down with it.Just received the replacement today. It powered up for about ten seconds before turning off never to spin up again. At least there was no explosion this time.At this point, I'm done with this drive. I'll be looking into another brand."
3,PLEASE READ B4 BUYING OR IF RECENT BUYER!,"The FireWire 400 cable that is included was defective. I had to get 3 shipped because the first hard drive I just thought was defective...then I tried out the second, and same thing happened it burned up, but not in smoke. After the second one failed I called WD to troubleshoot. The advanced person there told me the FW 400 cable was defective. Western Digital will send you another FW 400 cable free. The customer service on Amazon is A++, and thank you WD for being truthful, and sending me a new wire for my next shipment (that's if they don't fix the problem before they ship me another one). They told me to test with a different FW cable (if you are using FW 400 use a different cable or one sent tested by WD). Hope the third one has no problems. The lady from Amazon left a note just for my order explaining everything to whoever is in charge."
2,The MyBook Enclosure Failed,"I used this unit for a year +, then it stopped booting up and I could not access it all. It would power on but nothing worked, USB or Firewire, and I troubleshooted it for quite a while. Recently I just got a new USB/Esata hard-drive enclosure intending to use it for another hard-drive. Decided to test, so I removed the physical hard-drive from this now broken MyBook, and installed into the new enclosure. To my surprise, it booted up just fine and now I have full access. So, I believe the MyBook enclosure it itself faulty and burned out. For others who may have this problem and it is out of warranty, the hard-drive itself may be salvageable and you may just need a new enclosure! Still I would only rate this 2 stars because the MyBook enclosure should not fail like it did."
2,Missing Cable,Never got a chance to try out the drive because it was missing an interconnect. When I tried Western Digital support I was kept waiting for 45 minutes and hung up. I returned the item and would avoid the brand in future.
1,Avoid this product,"I have been a fan of Western Digital hard drives for many years, but that ended with this product. I purchased an Essential Edition 250GB drive for my daughter as a Christmas gift, by New Years it was DOA. Giving WD the benefit of the doubt, I exchanged it for an identical replacement. This one made it until early March. Three clicks and it turns off. WD says there is nothing I can do but return it under a RMA. They can do nothing about the lost data. So much for using this drive for backing up important files. I've have had at least a dozen WD drives over the years and never had a failure, they just became obsolete because of their size. This produce however....STAY AWAY!"
3,Does not perform completely as advertised,"My Book Pro Edition is an adequate backup drive, but I was disappointed that two of the main features of the unit -- the illuminated fuel gauge which tells you how much disc space is currently being used and the automatic shutdown when you turn off your computer -- don't work as advertised.After troubleshooting, reinstalling the drive and spending over an hour with Western Digital tech support, I sent it back to the reseller and had another one sent. Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the replacement unit, so apparently this is a flaw with all the units.I'm using an iMac G5 with the latest OS installed, so everything's current.Oh yeah, and the Retrospect back up software that's bundled with it doesn't work.My Book Pro Edition is functional and is cool-looking, but most of the bells and whistles that are advertised don't work properly. Therefore, I cannot give a full endorsement of this product."
1,Not for Macs--maybe not for anyone,"Don't believe the claim that you can ""just plug it in and it's ready to use."" This product is set up for Windows, and the instructions for installing the drive for a Mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the Windows software. It's easy to become hopelessly fouled up.Don't expect any help from Western Digital. If you can actually get connected to them, and your call isn't dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so, you'll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive. Their web site help is equally useless."
2,Not really for novice Mac users,"The Retrospect software included with this hard drive is not for the novice. I've used a Western Digital external hard drive successfully for my Windows computer, but after a several hours of fiddling with the software I still haven't achieved a successful backup on my Mac. WD customer support for the Mac has been useless; the software supplier, EMC, wanted $70 to consider my questions."
2,It works.... kinda,i've actually had no problems using this product on both mac and pc. works great except the firewire 400 connector stopped working afer about 2 days. Luckily theres usb as well but still its cheap and effective
5,"Energy Shake is ""Sweet!""","I have been using Sweet Success Vitatein Super Shakes for about 6 months now. It is a great tasting shake which I use in place of my breakfast meal several days a week. Even though it is only 200 calories a serving, it keeps me satisfied until my noon meal. A check of the ingredients and vitamins tells me me that I've found a great source of fiber, Omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and ground flax, all in a delicious package that helps me maintain my weight. It's available in both Vanilla and Chocolate for variety, which I find equally good.I know some people use the product as a midday energy ""pick-me-up"" or as a protein supplement following a work-out, but I like it as part of my controlled carb diet routine. The fact that I can now get it at a discount from Amazon.com as compared with Sweet Success' comapany website simply makes it better."
1,Beware!,Received this item today and it had expired 2 months ago. Now I have the hassle of returning it.
2,"A biography, not a movie","It is a sweet tale and an interesting biographical story of a wonderful horse, but it lacks a substantial plot."
5,Great Classic Movie!!!,"If you have a horse-lover in your household like we do, you will cherish this classic for decades. We have rented this movie endless times, caught it on TV but nothing compares to having your very own copy."
4,One of the great voice performances,"No child who ever read this book was the poorer for it; indeed, many learned consideration for the first time in their lives. This film version brings the lesson along with its gorgeous color and lively music. One of the great voice performances ever captured is given by Alan Cumming as the voice of the horse. It's the strongest performance in the film, as well as the longest. Bean fans will be disappointed by only two early scenes. Thewlis is appealing as the cabbie, but it's Cumming's movie all the way"
5,GREAT ADAPTATION,"Horse-lovers should watch this. It is (mostly) true to the book and the horses are trained well. It goes from Beauty's birth to his final home and is told from his viewpoint and reveals the cruelty of bearing reins and the terrible hardships of a London cab horse. Highly reccomended for those OVER 10: some scenes are very sad and ""real"" for young children and there is a little swearing, but not much."
5,i loved this movie,this movie is so beautiful it was full of hope and faith in the horse i cried at least twice it was a truley beautiful film and very heart touching!!
5,A movie for all ages,This version of Black Beauty far outweighs it's predessessors! It's an excellent adaption of Anna Sewell's book and adds insight that is poignant and insightful. All people of all ages will be happy with this wonderful childhood story!
5,GRAND MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is about a Black horse named Beauty and he tells us the story of his life. It starts when he is born on a farm and when he grows up he has to leave the farm and he finds himself a new home. And the home is even better then the farm. He meets up with new friends there. He meets a playful white pony and his new girlfriend Ginger. A brown horse. Though through the movie he tells that his life moves on from good people to bad people but in the end everything turns out ok.It's a GRAND touching story!Do buy it!
4,One of the most faithful Black Beauty movies,"Considered to be the truest filmed version of Anna Sewell's timeless book,1994's Black Beauty follows the unstable life of an intelligent ebony stallion (played by Doc's Keepin Time) in Victorian England. As he does in the novel, Beauty narrates the tale (he's voiced by Alan Cumming) from his idyllic birth, through the tragic events that led to him having to be sold, and how his happiness was completely at the mercy of those who held his reins. Masters both kind and cruel shape the horse's rather Dickensian life, as do his closest equine companions: A mare called Duchess and a self-willed pony named Merrylegs. Very nicely filmed and well-acted.Staci Layne Wilson"
4,Not just for horse lovers -,"Excellent adaptation of the classic book, that gives a voice to creatures in a new and startling way. It helps to love horses, but this viewpoint will speak to animal lovers, and help impress on young children the importance of pet responsibility. After all, as the main character clearly says, all animals have no choice, and no voice.Better that we should care for them even more diligently. The film clearly brings out how an animal suffers, if their care is neglected, even once. Very instructive, and highly recommended for all ages."
5,My 6 year old LOVED this movie!,"My daughter reads Black Beauty over and over and was excited when I brought a Black Beauty movie home from the library. It was the version from the 70's and she deemed it confusing and not too much like the book.Today we watched THIS version - the one with Alan Cumming as Black Beauty's voice. My daughter was delighted with it - she kept pulling her book out and showing me the parts of that she could match up with the movie. She loved that the horse ""talked"" - which is how the book is setup up, so it was very faithful to the story. It was a really beautiful version and I highly recommend this one."
2,A bit boring. 15th april 2004.,"Kids would probably enjoy it. It was quite good the first time i watched it then i thought it was a kiddy film, but anyone would normally like these sorts of films. Not me it isn't my type."
1,Cry me a river,Do you have a box of tissues you don't need? Well rent this movie and you'll need it. It's so depressing! I cried through the entire movie. Rent it if you have dry eyes; these animal movies could put Visine Tears out of business!
2,A very childish thing,This movie was an absolute good mood-killer. It was very childish and seemed that it was made so that young girls could admire pretty horsies. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is older than twelve. The only good thing about the entire movie was Sean Bean's yet another terrific performance.
1,A book to put you asleep.,I love to read.This is the worst book I have ever read. It's very boring. Black Beauty is the perfect horse. Never doing anything wrong. There is no climax. I don't see how this book stuck around and became a classic. END
3,Not what is pictured,"The picture shows Maxwell House Rich Lite; I wish that was what I received!There is a major taste difference. Amazon, please make sure that the product you ship is the product actually ordered!"
4,"Great coffee, great convenience!","This is a very good coffee, and I enjoy having a large amount delivered to my home, ready to put in the pantry."
5,First Year Polish,This was a very useful book for learning Polish. I lived in Poland for a year and a half. This book was one of the things that helped me become fairly fluent in this hard language. I also reccomend the the Intermidiate Polish by Swan.
4,Several trips in one book,"Roff Smith writes in this book about more than one trip to Antarctica, and in each trip he moves around from base to base to explore the place. For this reason, the book feels a bit disjointed, but it is a great portrait of the place and the people who live and work there today and the support systems that help them from the outside. Smith is often funny, as well as awestruck. That seems to be the effect the place has on people."
3,"good writing, interesting stories, but...","How can you do a National Geographic book that covers multiple trips to Antarctica with no photographs and no maps? I also found Smith's condescending comments about the United States to be annoying. Yes, I can imagine the beaurocracy seemed pointless and tedious, but still. Not to acknowledge in the list of acknowledgments anything of value provided to him by the U.S. Antarticic Program seems petty. To read between the lines, I felt that Smith was saying that an Antarctica with no U.S. presence would be superior to any value that the U.S. has provided there."
4,Needs Pictures!,"I've been fascinated with Antarctica since hearing Vaughan Williams' Sympony No. 7 ""Antarctica."" This is the first book about the area that I've read. I found it fascinating right from page one. The author wastes no time getting to the ship and the voyage, and does a tremendous job describing the landscape.However, for a book about a personal journey to a place 99.9% of the readers will never visit, I found it downright stupid (sorry) that there are NO photographs of this foreign landscape! One of the very first scenes described by the author is how a group of penguins poked around his camera bag, so we know the author took many, many pictures...how about sharing a few of them?That's my only complaint, and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars."
3,Good compilation,"This album is a compilation of the Alligator records artists in the 80s and offers many highlights. The style varies greatly from the blues/rock of the Kinsey report, to the country blues of Alvin Bishop, to the jazz of Charles Brown. The album is the best of the 'HouseRockin' series and offers a link to the various artists of the Alligator label at that stage. The many highlights include Lonnie Mack, Delbert McClinton, Kenny Neal, Tinsley Ellis, Lucky Peterson and William Clarke."
3,misleading cast info,"This movies says it stars Hrithik Roshan. That's the reason I rented it. He only does the Krazzy 4 song and dance at the end of the movie. SRK performs the same song in the middle of the movie. I was disappointed in this deception. Otherwise, it was a funny movie, but just not what I was expecting. If you say a movie stars a certain person, they should be the main character, not a dance number."
5,Touching and Powerful,"Of all the young adult novels I've read, this is probably my favorite. Richard Peck's Remembering the Good Times is simply marvelous. An unbelievable, masterful book. Peck gives such an enjoyable to read, realistic picture of life with his characters. Peck with the beautiful yet deeply saddening ending to the book makes us ask, How well do we really know our friends? Thumbs up. A young adult masterpiece!"
2,An indescribably sad book,"This book is one that tells you to listen to your friends because they might be telling you that they might need some sort of mental help. It describes how three friends each have a problem in their life and how they try to solve them. It also asks you, ""How well do you know your friends?"" This book has many clues as to what is going to happen at the end of the story. Peck gives great sadness and surprise to readers in this novel. I gave it two stars because the beginning was not very interesting."
1,The best of Collage is definitely not here,"""Due Ragazzi Nel Sole"" is one of my all-time favorite love songs, and the version included here is NOT the original version that hit the charts in 1976, but yet another version recorded by the band with different arrangement, melodies and harmonies in various parts. I don't know well the other tracks included in the CD's, so I can't tell if they're original versions or re-recorded versions too. Moreover, the CD was mastered with the audio at extremely high levels, and the songs sound annoyingly loud.You can find the original version of ""Due Ragazzi Nel Sole"" in the ""Ciao Ciao Bambina"" compilation. Collage and their fans deserved better."
1,Disappointed,"I've used L'Oreal crayon automatic pencil for a few years now. i was having problems locating them in the stores that I shop at, so i decided to order it on line, my mistake. The product was old and smelled rancid."
3,Dilbert book,"This book is a small book that gives much verbal background on the comic strips as well as the strips themselves. I'm not a fan of this format, especially in the smaller format, but it is ok."
1,it stings my face,"This stuff stings when I put it on my face. (No problem for arms, shoulders etc.) My wife has no problem with it at all. Everytime my kids put it on, I ask them if it stings and they agree with me that it does. I have better luck with the Hawaiian Tropic with Parsol."
5,Only stuff that works for my son...,My son has really sensitive skin. I use this on his body and face and he doesn't have any issues. The other spray types gave him a rash. I generally do not use any sunscreen on his funds unless it's made for the face. I use a spray product by Paula's Choice that is awesome.
4,Best on the market...wish it was tear free,"We have used this sunscreen on our son since he was born. Other than the occasional eye sting, it's been wonderful. We recently purchased Banana Boat Baby sunscreen since it's advertised as being tear-free. It is definitely tear-free...however, my son (and I) got badly sunburned today after only two hours in the sun. This has never happened with Water Babies...we won't make that mistake again."
5,Mike Hammer audio,Purchased this for my husband to listen to on his way back and forth to work (130mls one way). He really enjoyed it - especially with Stacy Keach reading it. Very good listening.
3,Billy Bob Thornton's Performance is Superb!,"Crisp direction and the outstanding performance of Billy Bob Thornton lends this somewhat run-of-the-mill plot just the suspense and mystery it needs to keep your attention. Great location filming also add to the film's ambiance. The simplicity of the plot's premise makes the story engaging; the lack of credibility looming beneath the two-dimensional qualities of the characters threatens to ruin it. Overall, worth the admission price and enjoyable, but not a masterpiece by any stretch."
4,VERY WELL DONE THRILLER. A MUST SEE FOR WHO ENJOY SUSPENSE,"If there is one movie that's a must, do see a ""Simple Plan"" You won't be sorry. You never know what to expect next. It is full of surprises and twists and turns. SEE IT!!!!!!!"
3,"Effectively atmospheric, ultimately emotionally empty","Sam Raimi uses a rural winter landscape to the same eerie effect as the Coen brothers did in Fargo, but the basic premise of the movie--after all the existential questions have been pondered and the layers of symbolism brushed aside--that money is the root of all evil is a hackeneyed one. It just doesn't play in an age when overpaid actors play characters trapped in poverty who automatically resort to the dark side with the promise of instant wealth. They just don't get my sympathy.Economic poverty is one thing; emotional poverty quite another. The latter affects rich and poor alike. The former and its attendant stresses can certainly be alleviated. Money is not the root of evil. It, like anything, can be an instrument of evil. It can also, as this film inadvertantly endorses, buy freedom from the grind of miserable obscurity that always existed in its characters. It just took the smell of money for them to realize it."
1,Disgraceful!!,"Watching this movie is very frustrating. There is one fatal flaw in this movie (involving bullets and a gun). The dialogue is cliqued and the symbolism overbearing and obvious. The completely unrealistic actions of the protagonists just drove me to madness. From the very beginning, the plot is just completely unbelievable. You almost feel like they are ruining their lives on purpose with one stupid action after another. You know in the beginning just how they will all end up. This movie is proof that even great acting (Billy Bob) cannot save a bad script. Enough with the crows!!"
1,A Simple Move That Simply Stinks!,"What a twisted pile of nothing! Obviously intended for those who of little education. This meandering mess is without any sincere attempt of movie making. It contains a good storyline that is never really explored. The only thing worthy in this failing feature is Billy Bob. His performance, as always, is outstanding. He has a way of getting inside a character and truly making that person real. Edit all else out and then you would have a movie. Paxton, Fonda - shame on the both of you for elementary acting and poor choices. Take a lesson from Billy Bob, if your gonna do a thing, do it right!"
1,"Billy Bob, Why?","The only way I can understand why Billy Bob Thornton wasted his time in this piece of schlock is that he didn't read the script first, or they paid him beaucoup bucks. I have never seen a film I believed less - the ""lure of wealth"" can not ""tear at kinship and friendship"" since there isn't any to begin with. I really wanted to like this film, but these characters were so unbelievably stupid and fake that I couldn't care for any of them. If you want moral dilemma, with a much better dose of Billy Bob (who is completely wasted in this mess of a film) go get ""Sling Blade."""
1,The worst movie of the 1990's,"This movie has to be the worst movie this decade. Not only was it boring, but in the end the two main characters make a bad choice. Any red blooded american would not make the same choice that they did in the end. I feel any one who likes this movie needs their heads examined."
1,Go see SHALLOW GRAVE instead!,"I went to see this film with great expexctations, after all the premise of the film is fantastic and the cast (Thornton, Paxton & Fonda) are usually dependable.But i wish i didn't - the film is exceptionally boring and all of the characters are unlikeable - there is no one to empathise with (not even Billy Bob Thornton , who is the best actor in the piece) - i didn't care if they all died. Hopefully Raimi will improve for SpiderMan! Watch Shallow Grave instead which has a similar plot but is far more stylish, clever and with much better acting."
1,Annoying Characters Make Movie Unwatchable,Couldn't finish the film. I just don't have the patience to watch people whose reasoning skills are this poor muddle their way through a drama to what is obviously going to be a messy conclusion. Blah.
5,The greatest movie ever created.,"This is the best film ever made. (yes, better than Titanic) The performances were astounding and the story was gripping. The ending left me phsyically shaking for a half hour after seeing it. A must-see."
5,This movie is SPINE TINGLING!!!!!!!,"I really loved this movie.If the scene in the police station,when Bridget Fonda calls about the ""F.B.I.""agent,dosen't make you sweat,then you're eating the wrong peppers son.."
4,"A nice little rewrite of ""Macbeth""","Bill Paxton is interesting (for once!), and it was criminal that Billy Bob missed the Oscar for this great performance. A tad overdirected (too many crows, and shots of snow patches framed by blackened trees and such), but I did enjoy the way Raimi shot Fonda's face in soft, pretty focus, thereby underscoring her Lady Macbeth-machinations. In a dreary year for Hollywood product, this one stood out."
2,Dissapointing!,The actors tried their best and thats all that matters but I felt the story line was awfully dumb and that it was a waste of time.
5,This movie will become a cult classic.,This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and keeps you entertained the whole time. Billy Bob Thornton plays an amazing role as the unmotivated brother of Bill Paxon. The chain of events in this movie really prove that money makes people do strange things. I loved this movie so much that I read the book afterward (first time I've done that). This is a must purchase for DVD collectors.
3,So-So,"The movie had too many holes, and not enough character development (ie it never really makes you like or hate anyone, maybe that was the intent?). Anyhow the way some of the situtations were handled were just plain stupid, they really insulted my intelligence a lot. The saving graces were some good plot twists, especially the ending as a whole (although completely unrealistic in every regard). Not a bad movie to watch, if you have some free time to kill."
3,"ENTERTAINING, BUT NOTHING ORIGINAL","The best thing about this movie was Billy Bob Thornton's performance - brilliant! Aside from that, it was little more than a Fargo/Macbeth wannabee. Lesson: Never copy the great ones! Your work will inevitably be compared and usually come up short."
3,SIMPLE BUT SUSPENSEFUL,"You just know it won't turn out all right in the end. Billy Bob Thornton plays a simpleton with a hardworking brother (an always good Bill Paxton). When they stumble upon a crashed airplane in the woods and come upon a large sum of money in the wreckage, they agree to split the money (among Paxton, Thornton and one of Thornton’s friends who is with them). As the relations among these three men grow more strained, the story grows less and less simple, leading eventually to murder. The plot moves a bit slowly, but the characters are fascinating in the way they develop and change as a result of the money. ..."
2,Weird....,"If I had not read the book before, maybe I would have liked this movie more than I did. After all, Paxton and Thorton give above average performances here.But what amazed most was the fact that Scott Smith himself adapted his original book to the screen. So, one could supose that the necessary amount of changes would be minimal and restrict.No. Smith himself changed a LOT of his book. Believe me, Hank Mitchell is a lot less bad than he is in the book.But maybe, when translating it to screen, Scott Smith realized that his acclaimed book had some unecessary excesses of violence, like, for instance, a horrible chapter in a small store, when Hank kills an old woman...All in all, it's a good movie for those who had not read the book. Also, it proved that Sam Raimi is definitely a great director beyond the horror movies."
4,Bizarre!,"This was such a bizarre movie! however, it was very entertaining. I thought Billy Bob Thornton did a great job and I am not a fan of all his movies. If Fatal Attraction kept you from having an affair, this will keep you from trying to hide 4 million dollars you find!"
5,A Simple Plan,"What would you do if you found $4 million, with no one around to claim it? That's the basic premise of this absorbing Midwestern crime thriller by ""Spiderman"" director Raimi. ""Plan"" is as much a study in the poisonous effects of greed as it is a dark-comic twist on the get-rich-quick genre, and Raimi prises splendid acting from his talented cast, especially Thornton (few play the backwoods idiot as well as he) and Fonda, who as Hank's wife turns from an innocuous, slightly nervous third party into a cold-blooded deviant at the promise of so much lucre. Neo-noir at its best."
4,Decent,"This was a decent movie with excellent acting. I found myself getting frustrated at the decisions made in scenes by some of the characters, and I believe that was not necessarily deliberate in the writer's part."
3,"Disappointed, After Reading the Novel","I suppose that I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if I had not read the book first. I realize that directors and screen writers have to leave out some things and modify others, but the way the ending was butchered (as compared to the book) was terrible, especially the scene at the airplane. This defies belief. Also, as good an actor as Billy Bob Thornton is, he did not make a very believable Jacob (as compared to the book). He presentd an entirely different persona, which detracted from the story."
1,did not work,"product did not work, Kept on putting it in several times and kept on getting incorrect disc. I have ordered other discs and my Toshiba dvd player is workimng. I have a bad back so returning this item and even being on computer is ver painful.. I fell on 2 rawhide bones on back and used a cheap warming pad on back which burnt skin off back. To me this is a very big iconveneince."
3,Not So New,"This is an old book and is somewhat wordy. It was interesting reading for a historical point of view, but reference to gasoline at twelve cents per gallon gives you some idea of its age"
2,Title is misleading,"I enjoy Harvey Mackay's books but this DVD was a letdown. The title created an expectation of many useful strategies to ""outsell, outmotivate & outnegotiate"" my competitors. What I found was a mix of common sense ideas, semi-interesting anecdotes, cute stories, along with some good useful advice. With a 48 minute runtime, there's no need for fluff and filler. I expected a barrage of valuable ideas that I could apply in my own business.One of Harvey's ideas is to never be boring or predictable. Ironically, many (all?) of the examples he recites on the DVD were taken from his previous writings. If the DVD material is recycled from his books, then it should have been titled ""The Best of Harvey MacKay"".In fairness, this is the first Harvey MacKay product that I did not like. Had I not previously read any of his books, I may have given this DVD 3 stars, but no more."
3,Only for Battlebots fans,"I loved watching the Battlebots battles on Comedy Central while they were on. This DVD does indeed capture the beginnings of the ""sport"". There are no extras on it, and it is obviously a video put onto a newer medium (ie, VHS to DVD).While entertaining, it fails to show full battles. It offers clips of different battles one right after the other.Yes, it does have insights into the Pit, some builders, and has a list of robots at the end.While good, I found this DVD to be something that was obviously an attempt to cash in. It could have been better."
1,Ashamed I bought it!!!,"I am ashamed that I paid $25 for 40 minutes of footage. There was no full battles just random clips, which gave you no context for the footage. Overall I would avoid buying this if you are considering it."
1,stupid waste of money,"It's a waste of time! There are no full battles on this video! Good for ""behind the scenes"" info, but bad for seeing actual battles. I want my $25 back!!!!! If you want to see ""battle Bots"" actually BATTLING, do NOT buy this product. This video seemed more like a bonus feature on a full-length DVD... but the 40 minutes of behind-the-scenes blather is the ONLY THING on this DVD. And $25 bucks?? Really?? For THIS??? Don't waste your money on this product."
3,it's Ok,"I gave this product only three stars, for what you get it's a bit high priced. The dvd only contains general high lights instead of the full battle by battle program I was expecting it to have."
4,Mr.Kiss,"The product was , fine but it had a wide band, and date window was too small to see. As far as Amazon great as always. Thank You!"
2,Descreption not accuate.,"Color of face not white, but silver. Also, dial size is larger than size given in item description. Item was returned."
2,not a white dial,"I give this watch a two-star. It's not a bad looking watch. Very slim and lightweight. But it's not a white dial. It's a silver dial. So it's not what it was advertised to be. And, this is my second Skagen that arrived with a bad battery. I replaced the battery on the first watch at my expense. I'll probably return this watch."
1,I am not happy with this purchase,"I order this watch reference number 233XLSGS as you can see in the catalog, the watch is copper color, I received a silver- stainless color.I send an email to Amazon for they to correct the mistake, they tried and send me another watch but they send to me the wrong watch again, now I got two watches exactly alike and these are not the watches I ordered.In addition the belt buckle on the first one kept coming lose.Some one is not doing his or her job.Harold Holguin504 362-5492"
5,Skagen Watch,"I saw this watch at Macy's during the summer of 2007 on sale for about $100. Amazon had the same watch in December 2007 for half the original price. I ordered it and am pleased to say that it is a great watch, extremely light weight and super thin. I wouldn't hesitate to buy additional Skagen watches through Amazon."
1,quit running after a few months,"I'm not sure what the problem was with this watch, but I had a jeweler replace the battery twice, and still didn't work"
4,Very nice watch!,"I have been wearing Skagen watches for a long time and really love this one. It looks sharp, has good visibility, and the mineral crystal seems impossible to scratch. The only negative with this watch is the date display. It's too small and therefore difficult to read. Otherwise, I love it!"
5,Slick Looking Watch,"I am a collector of different watches with different price points. I own cartier, rolex, invicta, patek about 60 others. Skagen is an inexpensive brand that is done with good taste. It looks like it cost way more than it does. I like all sorts of watches heavy, thin, dress and sport. This one is just a cool watch with an air or elegance and good taste."
3,attractive watch,very attractive watch but i had to return it for an exchange due to the ridiculously small calender window. i have 20/20 vision but as the calender counted up past the teens a magnifying glass was necessary to read the date!
4,slim line,Skagen men's slimline mesh watch - great value for a slim light weight watch. Not that heavy bulk. Date could be larger. Dial easy to read.Skagen is a good brand and we love the Danish connection since my husband's family comes from Denmark!
5,"Passion, Intelligence, and Scat: More Deb Pasternak","Signature Sounds recording artist Deb Pasternak's album More showcases much of this rising singer-songwriter's talent, and also provides an insight into her roots. Deb's musical passion shines through in songs like More, Mary, and Pick-Axe Love Song, while the whole album lets you know that there is a fierce intellect at work behind what you're hearing. There is a heavy Joni Mitchell influence at work here, but Deb is always herself, throwing in the odd scat riff in her acoustic jazz-folk. This is one of the best CD's this reviewer has heard in ages."
2,This is NOT trance.,"Personally, I love trance (especially hard trance)...and I don't enjoy this CD. I'm not denying there are a few good songs on it, and DJ Tatana does know how to DJ, but his CD lacks one thing-creativity. Nothing is apparent to me that made this unique than an DJ mix that you can download free (and legally) online.I do enjoy listening to Eye of the Tiger and Man in the Moon, those I believe are good examples of trance, though still not the best I've heard. I do not recommend this CD to anyone-even though it says those who enjoy ""stadium trance"" (which 'eye of the tiger' I believe is a good definition of) will love this CD. Maybe I have the wrong defintion before I bought this, but this is not a type of trance I like anymore.I recommend you check out www.di.fm for some great electronic music (and if you go to www.di.fm/edmguide you will find excellent defintions of all genres with sound samples. You will find ""Stadium Trance"" is not listed.)"
5,My Fave Trance Album,"I bought this album nearly six years ago, and I've never grown tired of it. The trance on here is big, and almost anthem-y at times, but very well made and mixed. I recently found my old CD all crapped up, so I actually bought a second CD - gosh, I haven't purchased a CD in years! I really love this album."
3,Good but not great..,"Don't pay full whack for this, if it's going cheap then by all means..The whole album has a 99/2000 trancey feel to it which can only be a good thing, but unfortunately only a few songs stand out IMHO:-Fragma - Man in the moon (bit cheesy but it's quality cheese ;))Darude - MusicVimana - We came (quality)Hampshire & Nysse - Eternal voices (v. nice)Trance Allstars - Lost in love (not bad)The mixing is very good, but then it should be as DJ Tatana is a very accomplished DJ and she's done some damn fine mix CDs, go and take a look for yourselves.Keep the trance alive!Stu"
2,At least its better than volume 2,"What the hell! Does anyone realize that the first track on here is just a vocalized version of last year's Cafe del mar (Marco V. remix)? I am not impressed. Though there are a FEW great tracks on here you'll find yourself playing those and only those songs, ultimately playing them out sooner than you had hoped. Volume 2 is the same way, maybe even worse. I buy them because they are very low priced and the mixing is good. They definitely know how to suck me in though. By having a well known trance artist mix each volume. Voodoo and Serano mixed the second. We'll see who mixes 3."
2,This Is Trance,"Never mind the other compilations titled This Is Trance; this one attempts to convince you that it's the real deal, unlike the others. Though it definitely is trance - and so is the music on the other discs titled This Is Trance - this isn't particular representative of the style. This particular disc, released by the Universal-distributed Water Music, does hold a slight edge over most of the other This Is Trance comps, if only because the contributors are more likely to be recognized. DJ Tatana runs through a set of 17 tracks, including ATB's ""In Love With the DJ,"" Timo Maas' ""Old School Vibes,"" Sarah McLachlan's ""I Love You [BT Mix],"" and Conjure One's ""Sleep [Ian Van Dahl Mix]."
5,Can You Fall In Love With A Cookbook?,"I saw Sandra Pinckney's review of the Sante Fe restaurant recently on her FOOD FINDS program. The restaurant was so adorable that I immediately went online to amazon.com to see if they had a cookbook. They did. I ordered it. When it arrived at my office I started reading it and couldn't put it down. From the front cover to the last page, the artwork is exceptional. Hand-tinted photographs along with photos and murals really make this a cookbook to keep and cherish and pass down to family. I can't wait to visit Cafe Pasqual in person and hopefully get the book autographed by Ms Kagel and Ms Simpson who was the photographer. The receipes are lovely, but the book is exquisite."
3,Amazon should show a recipe in the preview!,"Cafe Pasqual's was our favorite Sante Fe restaurant, and having enjoyed their wonderful food, I should have known that anything tasting that good would be very complex to make and involve specialty ingredients not available everywhere. If even one recipe had been included in Amazon.com's preview, I'd have seen this and not have had to buy it and then return it. The recipes do look like they're not holding anything out, and the book itself was beautiful; in other words, this book would be great for someone who's ambitious in the kitchen and has access to southwestern ingredients."
2,Disappointed,"I loved the cuisine on a recent visit to Santa Fe. A waitress suggested there were 2 books on Santa Fe cooking. Unfortunately, I did not preview this book before I bought it. Most of the recipes are too involved for me, and meals we enjoyed were not really in the book. Overall, I was not pleased."
2,Ridiculously Simplistic,"What a disappointment this book was. The very first sentence reads, ""Men and Women have been in conflict for thousands of years."" If this is your point of view than this book may be for you. But if you believe that relationships are much more nuanced than this, pass the book by.The case studies were generally sad in that the biggest problems the women were having was that they had created sad lives that were firmly entrenched in the dominant cultures view of life to be meet a nice man, have some kids and live a nice middle class life. If these women had actually taken the effort to break out of such a constructing mold, they would likely not have had to worry about their sexual desires tanking as a result of cutting off their life force.If you've done any work with your own sexuality or work with Earth-based spirituality this book will likely be much to simple and boring for you."
1,Life is so Black and White,"Let's see, I'm not a maiden, never was a mom, but at 42 I'm a crone? Gee, not much middle ground between maiden, mom and .... withered, old hag. I'm glad that Linda Savage, Ph.D. has made life so simple for me to understand. That must be some ivory tower she lives in."
3,Just Okay,The book is okay in that it gives you a quick and dirty overview of ASP.NET. The code examples are okay but where the book falls short in that the author babbles a lot rather than actually discussing the subject.
4,"Decent, not the best...","This book is good for anyone wanting to get their feet wet with asp.net. It's nice they presented both vb.net and C# code however, this book is riddled with syntax errors like the holes in swiss cheese.Peter Ladka did a good job with the overall material of this book, but his ""Technical Reviewers"" must have not been paid for their efforts, otherwise they would have probably paid more attention to detail."
3,"Good for designers, not developers","Good book if you don't have the minnimal idea of what Web Programming is, very practical por starters; Altough the guy kept comparing everything to food and eating habits. LOUSY definition of how DataBinding works and how the framework manages data..."
5,Need to get up to speed quickly with ASP.NET? Get this book!,"I have been programming for a few years in a number of the popular scripting languages such as ColdFusion and ASP. I needed to get up to speed in ASP.NET very quickly for an upcoming project. I had purchased several other books about C# (my preferred .NET language) and ASP.NET, but, the other books went into way too much detail trying to cover every nook and cranny of the language. They were more like reference manuals than training guides. I just needed a book that showed me the differences between ASP and ASP.NET and the essential things I needed to know about ASP.NET to start coding now and not 3 months later after I've read a 1600 page tome! Those other books have now become useful in gaining a deeper understanding of .NET after learning the critical core with this book. I'd give this book a 5+++ rating!"
4,Important Observations,"Clark's main thesis is that if the current immigration patterns persist in California that state and the nation as a whole could be in serious trouble. The population of Califrnia due to immigration is exploding (mostly with hispanics who are not assimilating well). These immigrants tend to gather together causing strains on local communities in providing public services to these immigrants.Clark believes entry into the United States should be based more upon skills and human capital rather than family reunification. Furthermore, he believes increased funding in education should put forth on the part of the federal government. Hopefully, in his opinion, this will even the playing field somewhat and help immigrants assimilate more effectively.This book is a worthwhile read especially for those interested in immigration and its potential effects on local communities."
3,A bit Disapointed,It was Elderberry tea in a can but there was nothing else but the name on a crooked label for loose tea and not tea bags. I quess I thought it would be presented a bit better with an explanation of the tea and not just crammed into a small tin. It did arrive on time.
1,fake elderberry tea,"All drinks,hot or cold, should be labeled if it has caffeine in it there are some people can't have caffeine because of certain heart conditions it could put them in the hospital or worse! I would rate this tea O, because of lake of information I became ill!Elderberry Tea 50 Tea Bags"
5,Bod Solid Home Gym is great,"I love this product. It is sturdy and very effective. It has upright, flat, decline - exactly what i wanted. It is better than anything else on the market for this price range"
1,Body Solid,"Flat, Incline, Decline Bench for Home and Commercial UseI ordered a Body Solid ""Flat, Incline, Decline Bench"" for Home Use.""The box came to my house in good condition on the outside, but when opened, I found all the pieces thrown about in the box.It was obvious that this was not a problem caused by FedEX, but was completely due to the poor packaging and lack of protection for the contents.The entire frame was scratched up and many pieces were missing.I was very disappointed in the way the manufacturer packaged this product and would not recommend it to anyone."
4,excellent product,"I am a personal trainer and I really like the stability of this bench. It is very helpful to me as a great training tool. The only thing I don't particularly care for is the gap between the seat and the back of the bench. If it were a little smaller, it would be much more comfortable to me and to my clients as well. Other than that, I would highly recommend this bench."
4,Good Product,"Received the item on time with some of the parts(Lock Nuts, Washers)missing. After emailed & called their customer service the missing parts were provided. However, it took multiply follow ups and over one and a half week to receive the missing parts. Other than missing parts, i am satisfy with the product. It is a heavy duty bench that will last for life time. The installation is not as hard as it seems as long as you lay out all of the parts in order and follow the diagram carefully, it's not hard to install. Due to the delay in providing the missing parts i'm giving it a 4 star rating."
5,Heavy Lifter husband loves it,"I purchased this gift for my husband who absolutely loves this bench. For those of you who are on the level he is which is benching 300+ and consistent heavy dumbbell exercises, this bench will certainly benefit you. The foot rest attachment for abs are not manditory for the bench to be sturdy. He doesn't use them. He leaves it unattached but I will for abs. Very sturdy bench.This bench will need you to be a bit handy because it has some small pieces (they come in helpful packaging where each screw, washer, etc. has it's size and name next to it). It can be put together in less than an hour if you're handy.Its a nice looking bench as well as being a heavy duty one. This is our 3rd product by Body Solid and we are very satisfied.Review written on behalf of my very happy husband!"
4,"Great product, not so great assembly instructions","This is a sturdy, comfortable bench, which seems like it will last a long time. Once assembled, it is a good quality product. Unfortunately, the assembly instructions are a little lacking. All you get is a schematic which is blurry and hard to follow (you can download the same one from the manufacturer's website, which is a little sharper), but there are no step by step instructions. Actual assembly is not that difficult (takes about 20 minutes), but identifying all the pieces and figuring out how to put it together is unnecessarily complicated (took about 40 minutes)."
5,"A must have due to composition, performance, and production.","If you love the Apple recording band Badfinger, This happens to be one of their best efforts for many reasons: The composition of the material contains not only wonderful ear catching melodies and harmonies, but also all the ""hooks"" that should have made this a #1 albumn of its time. The production is flawless by Chris Thomas. There are definitely parallels between this albumn and the Beatles albumn ""Abbey Road"". This albumn received excellent reviews from the critics. However, due to lawsuits between the band's management and the record label, the albumn was taken off the shelves before it could reach the popularity it so richly deserved. This albumn shouldn't be passed up by anyone who loves music!!"
5,The Roots of italian rap,"This is the first album of these italian rappers and it shows their skills and originality that has made them the best italian hip hop group.J.ax's style and flow are still not perfect, but the force of this album are the words that speaks about how hard it was rappin' in Italy in 1993: the media censored them , people thought they were mad. At the same time in America ,Dr. Dre, Public Enemy and Run DMC were collecting platinum discs. The great purpose of the Articolo 31 was not to imitate these famous american groups , talking about a culture they didn't know (this was the precedent attitude of italian rappers), but they wanted to speak about their personal, and hard, experiences in italian ghettos, by creating a style that includes latin melodies and black grooves ,called ""spaghetti funk"". This style will see his better realisation in their future albums , but here we can see the beginning of this Italian miracle . Buy it and support it!"
1,Unbelievably Bad,"I bought this CD and couldn't believe how bad it was. The ""orchestration"" is played on a $25 Casio keyboard. They don't even play the notes, just a shapeless mush of block chords. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Big disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed in this rip-off karoke CD. The tempi are too fast, the singers are not very good, and the instrumentation sounds badly electronic. I plan to listen to any other Broadway show karaoke CD before buying - I wouldn't have bought this one if I had!"
1,THE WORST! Completely useless as accompaniment,"Purchased to help my son learn and sing the role. Accompaniment does not even follow the piano/vocal score. It is absolutely painful to listen to and I am usually pretty forgiving on amateur performances. The performers are really bad. I would be embarrased to attach my name to this. The accompaniment (karaoke)is unsingable as it can't be followed, unless you sing and just ignore it. DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Anybody want to buy my copy - - TAKE MY COPY, PLEASE!"
1,skagen Men's Slimline Mesh Watch review,I bought this item online and thought the price is right and hope the watch should work BUT I am totally disappointed... the watch starts to run erratically and some days it stops running completely. I tried to have a new battery replaced and YET it still does not run properly and even Stop running again.I returned it in couple weeks and promised to myself that I will not buy this watch online again ever through Amazon. I even paid extra shipping/handling just to return the darn watch. I love buying stuff online through Amazon but NOT particularly this kind of watch. Stay away from buying this watch online Shoppers!!!
5,Nice Thin Watch at a great price,"Even though this is an inexpensive watch, it frequently is noticed by others. I get many complements about the watch. The mesh wristband is very nice, almost fabric-like. The watch is very light and comfortable to wear. Well worth the price and then some. I highly recommend this watch to anyone who wants a stylish thin wristwatch."
3,It's a three of five.,The Skagen is pretty to look at but not so comfortable to wear and the time is difficult to read because the numbers & hands are not distinctive.
3,nice watch but band problems,"This is my 2nd slimline watch. Feels like your not even wearng a watchOne big problem is the mesh band. If your like me, who works with your hands the band easily gets caught and bends. Once bent the metal fibers stick out on the edge and can not be worn. Get this watch with the leather band only"
1,Don't Bother,"A beautiful watch, the flatest crystal. Do not buy it. I own 4. All 4 crystal shattered in very short order. I replaced 2 of them (at $25 ea) through Skaggen and eventually gave up. 4 watches, 6 crystals later, I'm done with Skaggen. Let's hope they don't start building cars..."
3,Not For Those Who Pick Up More Then A Pen At Work!!!,"This watch is beautifully thin and classy, but as the other reviewers have mentioned - the mesh band can begin to get loose and pick upwards. This causes it to snag your clothing and ultimately make the watch unwearable. So, unless your in the office ONLY when wearing it - your bound to damage the bands metal mesh fibers. Skagen is designed for people with small wrists or better taste then those who choose to wear the trendy oversized watch faces."
3,Buy a cell phone,I wouldn't be buying another one of these had the original not quit working. Why do I have a land line anyways? I carry a cell phone with me everywhere....
5,Great 2 line cordless phone,"Added this ""extension"" to my other 4 phones on this system. Great clarity, good range and flexibility."
2,Falling sound quality on both handsets after a year,"Have had no issues with the base station, though I use it with Vonage, so I don't use the base station's voicemail feature. After about a year the sound quality on both handsets is dropping off badly, both in speaker mode and non-speaker mode. One handset is worse than the other."
5,Excellent Phone,The phone arrived on time and was easy to install and use. The sound quality is very good and the battery charge life is much better than the much shorter life my previous Panasonic phone had.
4,Woorks good,"Needed to expand so added this extra handset. Works great, easy to hook up to existing system."
3,no going back from speakerphone,"phone's ok, what gets me is when you push the speakerphone button, say you want to hear handsfree when your called party answers while you do something else, you cannot go back to privacy conversation, you're stuck on speakerphone for that call.have not used the number programming or voice mail features, no help from me on these."
5,panasonic cordless handset,"the phone is great and very user friendly, a real quality product.also pretty shock proof. to sum it up i would rate BUY on this handset."
2,disappointed,"We liked these phones because we could add extensions. But we sent the first set back because the caller ID didn't work with our digital service. On calling Panasonic we were assured the caller ID should work with digital service, so they sent us another set, reconditioned even though we had paid for new phones the first time. The caller ID still doesn't work. I think we'll have to go to a different brand. We have MUCH older phones that the caller ID works fine with the digital service."
2,seller unreliable,The phone did not work when received. Sent several e-mails to seller and I never received a responce. Had to send it back manufacturer for replacement.
2,Not That Good,"Panasonic downsized the regular 5.8 ghz phone, and the Battery is Smaller. Range is not as good as the larger 5.8ghz but is ok sound is ok but not excellent. Big problem is that phone is too small and the keypad is more like a cellphone size.How did panasonic let this phone get to development?Not an Improvement. i am returning it and buying the older 5.8 Ghz Panasonic phone (the one with the external antenna).I love panasonics, but sometimes More is More.Jacob"
1,Poor Sound Quality,"This is probably the 4th or 5th wireless land line phone I've had and probably the 3rd Panasonic. The sound on my end is the worst of ANY phone I have ever used. The people on the other end hear me fine but for me at this end (with one base station and 2 additional satellite units upstairs) it is an unclear, static-filled, painful experience that is NOT improved by increasing the volume or hitting the Booster feature. This is the first phone I've had at the new highest frequency (900 MHz or 3 GHz or whatever) so maybe it is that. The base unit is no better than the handsets and the handsets are no better if you are close to the base unit. I'm seriously thinking of going back to my old phones but the LCD's don't work anymore so you can't make use of the Caller ID features! I had to buy this phone since I need a 2-line wireless option and there were no others. Other features were fine but the speakers are so poor that I cannot recommend this phone at all."
5,Great phone,This is a great phone. We have been using them for years. It has a great speakerphone. Don't take it in the swimming pool!
3,aaahh---ok,this phone is cool but it really lacks range. i would have thought i could go further before losing calls..nope. Each phone has a individual phone book which could be cool in certain situations but is a real pain because every phone in my house has different numbers. it is a pain to sync each phone with the household phone book. if i grab the wrong phone it may not have the number i need in it. the answering unit is only ok it does not have very user friendly controls for saving or reviewing messages after a period of time.
3,Love having extra handsets,"I made a mistake, I was reviewing what I thought was our new cordless home phone. But it was actually supposed to be for the extra handset we got with the new 2-line cordless set we also bought. So please excuse my review on this particular item as it's written before this one.Thank You!"
3,Lack of belt clip makes me unsatisfied,Overall nice phone but it is REALLY annoying to pay $13 extra for a belt clip. That piece of plastic should have come included.
4,"A strange but fantastic mix of Queen, Supertramp, and Metal","This unique brand of progressive metal borrows heavily from Queen and Supertramp. The first two tracks are quite heavy (probably a bit too heavy for my tastes) but then the album tones down a bit and some great melodies come through.Fans of 90's-era Savatage will probably love this stuff. Outside of Savatage side-projects, it's the closest I've gotten to finding something like Savatage. The vocals are more like Freddie Mercury than Zak Stevens, and it's a little more rough around the edges than most 90's-era Savatage.Frankly, I'm surprised that Rough Silk is as obscure as they are. I've been listening to progressive metal for a long time, and I'm just now discovering them. This is the second Rough Silk album that I've bought blindly, and I've been pleased both times.Right now, I'd give it a B+. Future listens may bump it up to an A-. Definitely going to continue to listen to this one."
5,Black Crowes DVD,"Very intimate setting for a double live album.They actually filmed the entire show a man's home up in the mountains that was a cabin,hence the title Cabin Fever!!Highly recommended for avid Crowes FANS!!!!ENJOY..."
5,Bout time,"Just got the DVD in the mail today. This is a great snapshot of their recording process that really captures the essence of this band. Some great candid scenes and incredible performances. Great to see Rich sing a little bit on ""Oh Sweet Nuthin"" Do yourself a favor and get this today!"
4,nice compilation,"this is good blues compilation. if you are just becoming a blues fan, pick it up, it will introduce you to some of the hall of fame blues players. lonnie mack is especially good on satisfy suzie. johnny winter rocks. hound dog taylor - incredible. if you are already a blues fan, this is a good cd to have, nice party cd, road trip cd, or just a way to introduce a new listener to the wonderful world of the blues."
2,Yesterday's blues,"This album was once memorable. However, as time goes by its impact has diminished. It is a sampler from Alligator records to prompt sales of its artists. The best tracks are the Roy Buchanan track (may he rest in peace) and the Jimmy Johnson 'You don't know what love is'. Most of the other tracks no longer excite. However, the 'Hound Dog Taylor' tracks are always worthwhile, particularly if you know the history of Alligator which built itself on sales of hound dog."
2,Needs practice,Its and okay mini Hula. It does not dance much. Maybe its still learning how to:-)You can buy this in gift shops near the beach like Ron Jon etc for half the price. The size is good for a sedan or for minimalists.
2,Buttocks shows and made with hazardous materials,"I bought this doll to place on top of a cake for my daughter's luau-themed birthday. The doll came with a warning label that it was made of hazardous materials. I planned to cover the base of the doll in plastic wrap and use it anyway as I was running out of time, but when I pulled the girl from its case, I discovered that her skirt didn't cover all that it should. I was completely unable to use this doll and threw it away. I ended up finding a larger doll at a dollar store that was made of plastic (without any warning labels for health or safety) and that was G rated."
2,Not A Hawaiian Hula Girl,"The doll would have been good enough if there wasn't a noticeable dark brown dot on the doll's nose. The first doll that we ordered was cracked at the ankles because the doll is top heavy and was made of a heavy ceramic-like material. Also, the doll does not look Native Hawaiian."
5,Positive response,"Thank you for prompt shipping, it was good doing the transaction with you. Makes a great birthday/anniversary gift for my wife."
4,Not my pick!,"This was for a gift. My husband requested it. Doesnt shake much, its ok looking. Cant complain for the price."
3,"Cute, but not alot of wiggle","Decent quality product, but really not alot of movement.I actually looked back at the listing after I received it to make sure that it was supposed to move. Maybe it was a fluke, but that was a downer for me.I would look around, but this is a nice dash icon if you are not too concerned about her dancing much."
5,Track 11 Sax Player,"The Saxophone Player on Track 11 ""Down in the Dumps"" was my Uncle Don Henry. :) He also toured with Conway Twitty playing the Sax and did alot of uncredited sax work for other famous musicians."
3,Roots of Rock Guitar,Good simple riffs -recognized many from subsequent songs. Easy to see how Lonnie Mack is revered by many rock guitar players.
2,Only One Track,"I bought this for the title track of ""Bridge of Sighs."" All the other tracks on both albums were unremarkable."
4,Rusting Already,"First of all, a part was broken on this when it arrived and communication with the company was extremely poor. We got the part after several sharp emails from me. The item is attractively shaped but I'm disappointed that it is getting rusty so quickly. Other than that annoyance, it is just the right size for our small patio and puts out a nice flame. I won't buy anything from this company again, however."
4,One Overlooked Detail,"While most people have commented on the looks and durability, they overlook the one detail that makes this exceptional. It holds lots of money and valuables because ""it's bigger on the inside than the outside.""Don't worry, you get used to it."
5,Dr Who toys for big kids!,"I have wanted one of these ever since Craig Ferguson put one on his desk, so I was absolutely thrilled to get my Dr. Who talking Tardis money bank. I had read some online reviews saying that one of the doors came off easily, so I wasn't freaked out when mine arrived off. But putting it back on it's hinges was a snap, and I was thrilled when I opened it and found I had the David Tennant Dr Who version - he's my favorite Dr! Not really sure this would be for kids - maybe older kids who really love Dr Who and can treat it delicately. But for this 47 year old kid, just having the thing start flashing and making the disappearing noise is great fun!"
5,Gideon's Trumpet,"This novel is a well-researched and well written tale of modern world politics and 21st century nuke terrorist activity. The author has created realistic settings, terrific plotlines and well-cast and multi-layered characters.The author writes a believable tale in a stinging style that is very readable and hard to put down. China and Cuba are allied in economic and military quests and the lead character holds the keys to survival or destruction. A great read for a second book from an author destined to rise quickly!!"
4,A superb first novel,"Set in Liberia, James E. Christi has written an excellent first novel. His prose is almost flawless. Characterizations are deep and compelling. The plot is complex and riveting. This well-researched historical work is among the best I've seen in quite a while."
2,Too much edited from TV version,"I was very disappointed to find so much missing from this movie on DVD. I have the TV version recorded and I know they left out quite a bit. This seems strange since DVDs are suppose to hold so much more information. I also saw the movie at the theater a couple of times,there are parts missing on the DVD that were in the theater version also. Don't buy the DVD if you enjoyed the TV version""with never before seen footage"". I had expected the DVD to cover it all,but at least everything I saw at the theater."
2,Just fast forward through the last 5-10 minutes...,"This film is well-made and entertaining until about the last 5-10 minutes, when it suddenly becomes so hopelessly preposterous and maudlin as to make you actually regret sitting through the whole thing! It's hard not to feel sorry for Kidman and Cruise for being forced to do and say such utterly stupid things, but I'm sure they were well compensated though they both looked fairly stricken too.In a nutshell: just as the happily-ever-after ending is almost clinched after a predictably suspenseful conflict/challenge situation, Tom Cruise has a near-death experience but is brought back by...Nicole Kidman's True Love and Heartbreak! Ron Howard as demonstrated in his other films is a fine director, with enough of a brain and good taste so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and blame this outrageously nauseating ending on some Hollywood producer(s) and their focus group of 13 year old halfwits and emotionally deprived housewives."
4,Far and Away is historically a good movie,"It is not 100% historically accurate, but it does show why so many Irish came to America in the late 1800's, how local Govt. was run in Boston at the time, how the Irish were treated by many at that time, and also how the last pieces of public land were given away by the US Govt. in Oklahoma."
4,Professional reflection,"I was quite impressed by the scene when Tom was trying to shoot the tenant and the gun exploded on his face. That was quite professional skill from the director. The movie as many movies of this kind, makes you think about the value of wealth. But what is special about the movie is its ending. The only thing that the movie missed was the right accent at the right time. Back in Irland Tom made an ill attempt to use an Irish accent. But then he left to US his accent changed dramatically. Apart from that a good movie."
5,a great historic film,"I have fallen in love with this movie based on the 1893 Oklahoma Land Run. My relatives on both sides of my family were immigrants from Scotland and Germany. Both of these participated in the 1893 Oklahoma Land Run. This Land run was pivotal to the developement of what is now the state of Oklahoma. The cinematography is wonderful. The actual "" Land Run"" scene makes you feel the excitement that those who staked their claim on the land must have felt. A great film by Ron Howard."
4,would have been a 5 star film,WITHOUT TOM CRUISE;none of you realize that an extra 30? mins were added to make it a 2 night tv movie spectacular?It made it all make more sense
3,My wife really likes this film.,I however think it is okay nothing more. Aside from Tom Cruise's bad Irish accent it is a fairly enjoyable way to send a couple of hours. I do enjoy this movie personally from a historical perspective partly as a fan of history and partly as being descended from Irish immigrants to Oklahoma. If you are from an Irish family or from Oklahoma this film is easy to relate to. Pick it up at least to learn a little about where you came from.
2,Far-Fetched and Away,An 'epic drama' this isn't. It felt more like a paint-by-numbers TV movie to me. A lot of cardboard-cutout characters and predictable plot devices. Was the ending ever in doubt? Nope. So where's the drama?
4,Wonderful Romantic film,"I know it's your typical sweet and sapy romantic film, and that Kidman and Cruise's Irish accents really sucked, but I liked it anyway. Sure it wasn't some mind-altering, profound, life-changing movie, but sometimes you just want to sit down and watch a flick that makes you feel good. This is it."
4,Good movie,"Nice story, well acted, even though Tom Cruise isn't a fave of mine. Nice that the instand version came along with the purchased DVD!"
5,Far and Away,"My favorite all time movie. Great love story, beautiful scenery, humor, excitment and the land rush scene made you feel like you were there. The production notes tell you the background on the story and Ron Howard's inspiration for the story which made it even more enjoyable.Highly recommended."
3,it's closer than you think...,"When I recieved this movie, the plastic disk that the DVD clips into on the DVD case was broken. The DVD was scratched up a bit because of this, but it played. I watched the movie and there were no issues with playback. The movie just wasn't as good as I remebered it being when I watched it as a wee lad."
2,Not my type,Not my type of movie -- can't say too much but didn't have the patience to sit through the whole thing / thanks to fast forward.
3,The Irish music adds a wonderful touch,"I won't give you the summary of the movie, as lots of other people have already done so. This movie gives a realistic picture of the stark world Irish immigrants found themselves in when they arrived in America. I really enjoyed the Chieftains's music (especially in the fight scene, since I have that album). The landscaping was very beautiful. The only problem I found was that the movie covered too much time. While I liked watching the main characters' feelings toward each other slowly change, I feel that it was too much distance to cover: from Ireland to Boston to Oklahoma. It had an ability to lose its focus.All in all, great music, beautiful scenery, lovely Irish accents. I wouldn't buy it, though."
2,WHY BOTHER?,"Far And Away has some beautiful scenery. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise look good. That's the good news. The bogus plot has..never mind, it's too painful for words. Was the dialogue coach for this dog Tony Curtis, bringing back his triumph in Ivanhoe. I'd walked out of movies before, but never insisted on a refund, especially from a theatre owner I consider a friend. I gave it 2 stars be- cause 8-10 year olds might enjoy it, though they may find it farfetched. Normally I like Cruise & Kidman, but I think Harvey the Pookah could have brought more to the picnic in the role of a stereotypical poor Irish lad triumphing over adversity & getting the rich girl. Watch for its release in thrilling 3-D Betamax, which is where it should stay."
3,Dated,"Good book for its time, but very dated ow. No one lives this way with their collection s in 2012."
3,The best book on the 1840 campaign,"This book was published in 1957 and is generally deemed the best book on the wild and unusual campaign waged in 1840. The Whigs nominated William Henry Harrison, who at the time was a mere clerk of court in Ohio,though he had in the past spent four years in the House of Representatives and four years in the Senate. The Whigs adopted no platform and based their campaign on songs and slogans. The book is the result of primary research in the newspapers of the day, and is well-done. Anyone interested in ante-bellum politics will want to read this book."
5,It will take you back to the time when music was Great!,"This whole CD is Great! The song ""Clones"" is one of those songs where you might not remember the name but when you hear it you know it."
3,Yes,"This was the first of the three Alice Cooper albums that he did in the early 1980's.Totally New style from the 1970's. Short playing, but can grow on you."
3,80s Alice,"I like all of the Alice Cooper CDs and I have them all because I am a fan. This CD, however, was not one of my favorites at first but with a few listens I was hooked."
3,A very different Alice,"Be prepared for a totally ""un-typical"" Alice experience. For awhile Alice Cooper had a life with little or no direction and this collection of songs makes the point.I bought it because Alice Cooper is one of my favorite music artists and knew I was in for something different just by reading the song titles. At first I was disappointed but this one will grow on you as the songs all tell a story even if a bit comical and they reflect Alice's mentallity.Despite what another review says, after owning this for years now, it is the number two albumn I will go for when choosing to listen to Alice. The reason for this is because all his popular music is heard frequently on radio stations but this is a classic that has little or no air time and I love it.For those that want to add to their Alice Cooper collection, buy it and listen to it a few times. Once you get past your initial response, it will quickly grow on you."
3,'Politically-Correct' Cooper,"All I can say is that the song 'Clones (We're All)' is one of my favorite songs he's done, but it could have been arranged better. I felt, however, that the other songs on the album were Alice's way of being 'politically correct' and commercial. Songs like 'Nuclear Infected', 'Asprin Damage' and 'Dance Yourself to Death' were dealing with 'topical' subjects at the time the album was created, and I truly feel that they were just written to kiss-up to West Coast-types. They just didn't seem to fit in to the style of music AC is known for. Of course, I could never give Alice's album less than 3 stars, no matter how disappointing it is. The story I heard circulated was that this album was released around the time Alice was experiencing problems from 'yuppie radicals' who were threatening a Native American jewelry store he owned. Maybe he thought the songs in this album would calm them down (or something)."
2,Fashion Protest,"New Package, new decade, new Alice? Clockwork Orange, shockingly thin Joan Crawford lookalike crypto commie,wide boy. Latest bid to corrupt and deprave another generation, nah ! Spot on collection of power pop gems? Nah ! Twenty seven minutes of neutered if freeflowing rock is what you get.The new wave, post punk climate would welcome a slicker leaner Alice, Alice who sais he can't remember this release, he should have hung around for the recording of it though. Alice sings about having parents who are junkies and are just so embarrasing its unreal, about haemophiliac romancers & crippled disco dancers. Hmmm! Yeah lets flush this fashion first time around"
4,Alice reinvents himself,"Everything you knew about Alice was out the window when he put out this strange album in 1980 that sounded-- well like 1980. Amazingly the hard rocker who'd become a pop crooner now sounded as fresh and original as the new bands that were just beginning to break.There are three standout tracks on this album. Clones was a minor hit. If you ever heard it, you probably wouldn't know it was Alice at all. It is slyly funny and great for dancing the robot. Pain was a track from the film Roadie and features Alice's patented dark humor and a nice steady beat. Aspirin damage is a quirky little classic. Most (or all) of the songs on this album are intended to be funny-- and they are-- wickedly so.The old album still rocks today. It was a nice departure for Alice. Should fit right in at any 80s dance party."
3,Alice Cooper - 'Flush The Fashion' (WEA),"Review number 43.Originally released in 1980,this was his follow-up to 'From The Inside'(see my review).Alice managed to snag The Car's producer Roy Thomas Baker to help out on this lp.When it first came out,I remember many fans not being sure how to take it.'Flush...' has some good tunes,like the Music Machine's 1966 cover of ""Talk Talk"",the hit ""Clones(We're All)"",""Pain"",""Aspirin Damage"" and the self-inspired ""Model Citizen"".Saw him on tour to support this effort and he like completely went 'new wave' on us.Many were disappointed,some were not.It's a far cry from what many Cooper fans would expect.It's okay to pull out every now and again for a spin.Line-up:Alice-vocals&fashion plate,Davey Johnstone-guitar,Fred Mandel-keyboards,John LoPresti-bass and Dennis Conway-drums.Love the cheezy cover."
3,Buy used.,The first songs on the lp are winners the rest kinda suck but that's the usuall Alice material>Throw in a good tune or two with lots of plonk.
4,Flush Da Fashun,"Yeah, yeah, we all know this isn't one of Alice's finer efforts. I mean, you'd never even guess it was Alice unless you're familiar with his voice(and that is sometimes tricky on this one). This is the first of what I call his ""weird"" trilogy( cruddy name, I know). The beginning of the decade made him want to reinvent himself, and he started it with the new waveish, slightly punkish album. He continued to expand on the punkish sound through the next two albums. But whether you view it as a guilty pleasure, rubbish or genius, there are some fantastic songs on this album. ""Pain"" I think is one of the best songs he's done lyrically. Basically, this one is for the completists(kinda like Yes' Tormato), because those who want to get into Alice Cooper aren't going to rush for this one first. If you become a hardcore fan, you'll eventually get around to this and either love it to death(haha) or have it sit there in your collection making it look larger."
2,Stick with early Alice,"You have to give Alice Cooper credit. They managed to evolve with the times nabbing critical acclaim in the 70's(with ""Love It To Death"" thru ""Billion Dollar Babies"") and their commercial success in the 90's. Oh, but there was the dreadful 80's!! On ""Flush the Fashion"" , Alice Cooper seemed like there were lost in time somewhere with no direction to turn. ""Aspirin Damage"", ""Nuclear Infected""(the list goes on...) don't even make decent album filler. On this album, Alice Cooper are just uninspired. They should have taken the 80's off. ""Talk Talk"", ""Clones(we're all)"" and ""Pain"" are quite good though. But sadly, 3 out of 10 good tracks don't add up to a good album. Do yourself a favor and avoid Alice in the 80's. Embrace the Alice of the 70's. It's worth the trip back."
3,Not at all a Clone.,"Well, well, well. And even better than ""well"". I return to Flush The Fashion some 20 years later with an embracing nostalgia and respect. Having not been the biggest AC fan at 16 I remember LOVING this album ( and I had'nt even bought it, my YOUNGER brother Tommy had a cassette ), and having heard it again I still do. But by not being the biggest fan ( as I mentioned ) I can see it as an autonomous effort, owing nothing to Ms. Alices' past or future ( now past ) endeavors. The punch your teacher in the face energy of ""Leather Boots,"" the coulda/shoulda/woulda promise of ""Talk,Talk"" ( pre Joan Jett cover bonanza-thon, mind you ) and by God the before our time techno threat of ""Clones,"" there's nothing more to say. So buy it, or don't. Like it, or don't. But the next time you wish someone could express ( truly, madly, deeply express ) you're oh so un-21st century desire to "" hurt..somebody..."" don't come crying to me. Or Alice. Or frigging 1981 for that matter."
2,Not one I would recommend,"I am a huge Alice Cooper fan, but this one is just not up to his usual greatness. It has some decent guitar work on it, but it generally just all sounds the same. Nothing at all like his earlier (perfect) works. If you like this era of Alice Cooper, I would suggest getting Hey Stoopid instead. It is much more true to his classic style, and a much better record, IMO."
2,"Thorough, biassed and both scientifically and sexually naive","James Jones's biography of Alfred c Kinsey is a valuable antidote to the hagiographies and demonologies published so far. Jones presents the nastier sides of his subject's personality and exposes his strategically concealed sexual practices. However, Jones presents Kinsey as a pervert and charlatan, failing to understand the moral and scientific rationales for Kinsey's approach to sex research and thus totally misrepresents both the man and his achievement. Jones's last-page sop to Kinsey's greatness seems to be a cowardly after-thought to a bilious, splenetic and angry book."
2,Mean Book,"Jones certainly did his homework, but the work comes across as mean, even vindictive. He shows Kinsey is the harshest light and he comes across as excessively judgmental. A more recent book, Sex - the Measure of All Things by Jonathan Gathorne Hardy is a kindler and more balanced look at Kinsey and his work. I recommend starting with that. Kinsey was a great pioneer -- not perfect -- but a true giant in opening up to the doors to our sexuality. The Christian right has spent the last thirty years trying to discredit Kinsey's work and take us back to the 19th Century."
2,"Great Story, Terrible Book","""Awkward"" and ""provincial"" wrote the NY Times reviewer, and I can't disagree. To get an idea of the biographer's perspective on Kinsey, consider that he refers to an interest in S/M as ""peculiar,"" and closes by predicting that had the atheistic Kinsey lived to see the age of AIDS, he would have seen AIDS as the work of a ""wrathful God."""
3,"Not what is described, but okay for the money","This is a cheaply-made lamp, for sure. The base is all made of pretty thin, weak plastic. It works fine, but IT IS NOT RATED FOR A 75 WATT BULB AS DESCRIBED (which is why I bought it). It is only rated for a 60W bulb, like any other desk lamp. All in all, nothing special."
4,A Good Handbook for Altar Servers,"Whoever plans to serve at the altar should have a copy of this book handy. It is designed as a handbook for all altar servers, in spite of the little variations in churches because of the difference in customs and the structure of the church. This books guides one through the ministry of serving at the altar step by step. With explanations of the objects used, names and functions of the other ministers at the altar and essential prayers at the Mass, this guidebook is as complete as it could be. The photographs and the diagrams are helpful for the beginners. Parishes should provide a copy of this book to every altar server."
3,pretty good,"This author is excellent, if you read ""The Medical Detectives,"" or others like it. I think this book is a bit less suitable for children, and I didn't care for it too much. Interesting subject though! I got it for the author and the title. I wish his story had been a bit better."
2,Becomes very dull quite quickly,"The book starts off well with detailed insight on the author's upbringing in a small town yakuza family, but becomes very boring after the first third of the book. Unless you have a huge interest in the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) circa 1970 and student uprisings, you'll want to skip large sections of the book.To be honest I stopped reading half way in, I simply lost interest. If you're looking for yakuza-style memoirs, read 'Confessions Of A Yakuza'. Toppamono deviates too far from the gangster world that I was looking forward exploring."
5,Accompanies the Book,"This is really a beautiful treatment of taiji sword practice. It offers a view of practice with an opponent present, making clear the practical applications of the poses and postures . . . Dr. Yang is an amazing practitioner and teacher. The DVD is extremely graceful but also practical in that the viewer can match it with the information given in the book. Dr. Yang would rather the student master manual taiji, then broadsword, then straight sword. That would be the right path for beginning at the beginning but it is not unusual for students today to be learning manual and straight sword taiji at the same time. Perhaps not optimal but some of us are beginning later in life and still building foundational skills and learning the meditation and philosophy at the same time. The book and DVD are a bit beyond me so my teacher has them at this time. Dr. Yang does not disappoint the longtime practitioner who has depth and skill already."
5,Functions ok!,"Even after I was done with nursing program I wanted to buy this manual blood pressure cuff because I want to keep one at home to check my family's vital signs. I like manual blood pressure cuff better than automatic one because manual is accurate. This product is just flawless, works fine!"
3,Meh.,"I love Nora Roberts books. I love JD Robb books. In general, I just love the way she writes, regardless of the subject or genre. However, Honest Illusions simply went on too long. I liked the book's characters, as I do with all Nora Roberts stories, but for once I actually checked multiple times (I read this on my iPad) how much was left of each section. I suppose this just proves that everyone is human, even the almighty Nora Roberts. Of course, this will in no way stop me from reading every Roberts book I get my hands on!"
5,Honestly the Best!,"I completely loved this story. The characters came alive and jumped off of each page, I could not put it down, like a woman obsessed! When I finished it, I started it again. Like a favorite movie you can watch over and over, I keep it near by and just pick it up. I wish I could find other's of hers like this I like as well. RiversEnd was equally excellent."
5,A Magical Story,I loved every page of this book! It drew me in and I felt what all of the characters felt. The story of Rox and Luke and their childhood love is wonderful. I only wish that I could become a part of something so magical and exciting!
5,I love Luke and Roxy.,"I read the reviews and was so anxious to read the book but I forgot to order it, but luck came my way a week ago and tonight I just finished it, and had to give to give it 5 stars. Fantastic characters, great plot, fantastic buildup and last but certainly not least a very smooth landing and great ending. No murders, just certain people getting their due justice. I will read one of Nora's books any day, but I'm waiting now for Three Fates to come out in paperback. Keep on writing fantastic books Nora because I will be reading them. This review was based on the trade paperback."
3,"Well, this was not one of my favorites","Sorry, but I don't have a lot of empathy for jewel thieves! And it's hard for me to like characters that I can't respect. If this doesn't bother you, then you will probably enjoy this book. She has written much better ones, however."
3,Not her best story.,"I am a real Nora Roberts fan but this is not one of her best stories. It didn't keep me guessing at anything. Maybe it was the audio narrator, not sure, but I found myself fast forwarding this one."
5,The best!,"The first Nora Roberts I ever read, and still my favorite. If you want an introduction to her writing, read this and get hooked!"
