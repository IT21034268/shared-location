4,What Time Is It?,"To be straight, the album has one big party theme with a few working phrases and riffs that T-Boz might be interested in. The entire Flyte Tyme set is brought foward on the performance agenda and a slight touch of Solveig still lingers in the air. Overall, its an air worthy investment for the club scene that should be accompanied with a hint of Ashanti."
4,"Old School Funkmeisters, Minneapolis Style","For me, this album will always be the greatest example of the R&B and Funk of Morris Day and the Time. What a line-up of talent! Jamie Starr (aka Prince) production, writing and amazing bass licks, the pop-eyed spectacle of Day on vocals, (with Jerome, his personal assistant), Jimmy Jams, Jesse Johnson and Jellybean Johnson, then Terry Lewis stepping in on bass...it was a whole lotta talent in one magical band that helped define 80's funk.The songs are funky with a rockin' guitar and rhythm that made you want to get up and dance. From the famous ""phone song"" to The Walk, it doesn't get much better...except live and in person! Prince wrote a lot of music, and The Time was the vehicle for the baddest and nastiest funk of it's time. No filler, all groove, and their best, if not most famous, LP."
5,A total classic of 80's music,"This is one of my favorite albums period an 80's soul band that jams on synths and slinky funk guitar by the group and area (Minneapolis) that changed black music in the 1980's. Led by Morris Day and crew Jesse Johnson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (yes that Jam and Lewis of Janet Jackson fame)Monte Moir and Jellybean Johnson JAM yes with big capital letters on six songs that sizzle and burn from the opening ""Wild and Loose' to the classics ""777-9311"" and ""The Walk"" and the smooth senstive (for the time that is )ballad ""Gigalos get lonely too"".You will never hear a mainstream black band jam on song for seven minutes anymore, so listen to this 50 yard dash of Nu Wave Funk And as ""Jamie Starr"" on Musicology said,""Don't you miss the days when real people played instruments""?"
3,Pretty Good,"this era of Prince was his best to me in terms of the sounds&vibe he was creating through the time. none of these songs are particular memorable,but the instrumentation is still remembered. the Bass Solo on ""777-9311"" along with the Drum programming that Prince was coming up with was tight. ""the Walk"" was cool. we will never know just how god the time truly could have been because prince was worried about them big time. The Time showcased themselves more on Stage, than on Record. Time Records were mainly Prince,Dez Dickerson,&Morris Day& some other minor contributions here&there. 1982 to me was the last time Prince had his sound together.he was in the Groove back at that time."
1,stupid,"an extremely boring album...not funky at all. And if you're wondering why this cd only has 6 songs, that's because each song is like super super long and boring...don't waste your money on trash like this."
5,"Runnin At Midnite, a film by Pablo Toledo","Runnin At Midnite is a must see for all parents and their teen children. This film is based on street reality. It is about boys who have lost hope and turn to a midnight basketball league to have a safe place to be when darkness falls.Written, co-produced and directed by Pablo Toledo, it exposes the raw truth about our youth that most of us know little about. This independent film won national and international awards, an amazing film!"
1,Only 2 songs and 2 melodies,The disk contains only 2 songs from Kill Bill and 2 melodies without words for these songs. I thought the disk contained more songs. It was my mistake but I am disappointed. It is better to buy soundtracks for Kill Bill.
3,"Great collection of Hunter/Ronson concert favs and rarities, sound quality so-so","The poet of rock 'n' roll is back. This great live disc (the limited edition version is 2 CDs) features most of Hunter's concert favs from the late 70's and early 80's.Even though the sound isn't the best this does get an extra star for songs that rarely get performed in concert(I'm the Teacher). The second disc is largely similar to the set list for Welcome to the Club although the production is a bit better on ""Welcome to the Club"". Interestingly, the sound on the second bonus disc is better than the first.It's a pity that there isn't a great sounding sound board recording of this material out there as the performances and the energy level are top notch."
3,"Great artist and performance, dismal sound quality","Although I am a huge fan of Ian Hunter and the performances on this 2-CD album are terrific, the import sounds like it never got mixed. Bootleg sound quality at best. The volume goes up and down and sometimes Ian's voice drowns out the band, whereas in other songs his singing is way in the background. The sound even cuts out entirely in spots. Really a disappointment, especially after hearing the amazing sound quality that Pearl Jam managed to achieve with its bootleg series."
5,Best sleep sack,"I bought this sleep sack for my first daughter when she was 10 m.o. We used it until she turned almost 20 months and now my second daughter is sleeping in it. It is very durable, high quality, and the best part is that it is made of cotton and much warmer than its fleece alternatives. I don't like unbreathable materials myself and always try to only use cotton for kids. I got the large size and never regretted, since it can be worn by smaller kids too with no problems. This so far has been the best baby product I have ever purchased for my daughters, highly recommend it."
2,If this is Love,Actuall i like this music coz i feel so good when i hear this songs. it part of my life.
4,Does everything you would expect it to!,The Columbia Antiseptic Powder did everything it is supposed to do. The Shipping was also very quick. Thanks again.
5,Great Designs,"I agree with the previous reviewer, these designs are incredibly beautiful. My sister-in-law owns this book and I have been borrowing it from her over and over. Until I saw this book, it was kind of hard to find stocking designs for everyone that celebrated Christ's birth rather than the coming of Santa Claus. Not any more! (Just so you know, there are also non-religious and Santa designs, too.)"
3,"Good, but not quite what I expected","I was very excited to get this book to start on stockings for me, my husband and 2nd daughter. I was disappointed with the limited designs. Half of the designs are only stocking toppers. The full stocking designs are nice but some aren't even related to Christmas. They are flowers or animals (deer & cardinals). Not exactly what I was looking for. I think I will only use one stocking design out of the whole book right now. There are several great ornament designs and other cute projects that I look forward to doing."
5,great,I had made 5 of these stockings several years ago. One daughter is getting married and I'm starting on one for the son in law. There are two more patterns left that I will use for the spouses of my other two children when the time comes.
1,A map,This map is just too small. Names of most streets do not appear on it which makes it useless to find exacltly where you are. Additional information such as public toilets seem a good idea until you realized that you find them everywhere in Istanbul while according to the map there is only one place for the whole city! In conclusion I found this map useful only the first day as a reminder of the layout of the city and never used it again.
2,"A good map, just a bit too small","This is a handy map of Istanbul, but unfortunately, it's lacking in size; If you're just visiting the centre city, it'll be great for your travel needs, but if you're venturing out of the city, it's missing a bit in that department. :o)"
5,Long May They Play,Great combination. This is Manassas with Neil Young on the Beach. I do not hear/see any Buffalo Springfields here except the cover art which in itself is misleading as a concept. Otherwise: Love it. Almost as good as On The Beach by Young.
3,"""Neil Young WITH Stephen Stills""?","The mp3 tracks credits ""Neil Young with Stephen Stills"" as if Stills was just helping out Neil. Hardly. About half of the tunes were written by Stephen Stills. I like Neil's contributions better, but still..."
5,as great as I remember,"this album seemed to fall off the face of the Earth for a while, and I couldn't understand it. I loved it from the first listen, and nothing has changed. There's more going on than is implied by labels like ""country-rock"", ""classic rock"", etc."
5,Long Overdue in CD Format,I waited a long time to find this on CD. What an awesome album. Anyone who enjoys solo albums by either Neil Young or Stephen Stills will love the songs here.
2,Still Awful,"I took this turkey out again and listened to it recently. Yes, really the title track and Fountainbleau are the only decent tracks. The rest is dull and boring. Steven Stills convinces us once and for all that he is totally out to lunch (read the Neil bio ""Shakey"" if you have any doubts).A sidebar in Neil Young's long and bumpy career."
1,Should say in description that this is entirely Christian driven,"I read a few reviews that said there were Christian views, which isn't a deal breaker for me so I took a chance. This book is entirely based on Christian principles and what appears to be the autho'rs opinion and nothing else. The first chapter states that Howard Hughes descended into a state of self neglect where he did not cut his hair or nails for years. This is clearly because Hughes was mentally ill, yet this author concludes he had no friends and was incapable of love because he chose to care about nothing but money and greed and just didn't try. I stopped reading and returned the book as well as another I purchased by the same author. I don't understand why this was not an issue for other readers."
5,Worth the time to read.,"This book was recommended to me by Richard Weylman. He makes alot of money teaching people how to be successful, and he said this book was worth his time. It turned out to also be worth mine. Friendships are so vital to our lives, but most of us maintain them by reflexes which are not always healthy orconstructive. This book has no great insights, it just points out some very practical ways to make and maintain friendships. That's why it's so valuable. You'll remember something you read every time you interact with someone, and that simple suggestion will make a difference you can feel. Just the small adjustments you make to the relfexive way you used to deal with others can strengthen friendships, soothe hurt feelings, and help you reach out to those who need you. And the whole book took about two hours to read. Buy it, read it, and then give it to a friend."
5,"""Frienship is the model for all intimate encounters""","'...Friendship is the model for all intimate encounters.' McGinnis says it himself in the book. And once you read the book, you'll see what he means. Not only has this book helped me with my relationships regarding friends and family; it has also helped me to become a better person. This small book is a good read. Read each chapter, think about what you have just read, let it marinate for a day or two, and then go on to the next chapter. Enjoy the journey!"
5,Everyone should read.,I rated this book this high because it had many one liner quotes that will help me daily. And if I can apply some of the information in this book it will help me in all of my relationships.
1,"I threw this book away, I disliked it so much","The author of this book made no distinction between friendship and romantic love, or how the two intersect, or don't. He didn't clarify whether he was referring to levels of intimacy in friendship between two men, two women, a woman and a man, a married couple, or a rabbi, a priest, and a nun. Since love has a spiritual element, it can be beautiful to be all-inclusive, viewing love on a spectrum, but this seemed more to be a case of not-very-well-thought-out information and ideas. I wanted more depth and clarity in an exploration of the topic of friendship than this book delivered."
5,The new guide for heavy Civil War ordnance,"It has been a long awaited moment in my 40+ years of experience in dealing with artillery projectiles of the American Civil War to see a book of this caliber in print. It is the most comprehensive guide or research tool for those with an interest in this field. It is appropriate for the novice and the more proficient.Mr. Bell, along with a multitude of hours doing research and the aide of his peers, was able to compile an impressive array of photographs (350+) and information for the reader.The book references shells from 4"" and up; including round balls, projectiles, torpedoes, land mines, and a chapter on sabot designs.I highly recommend Mr. Bell's book to those who want to expand their knowledge of Civil War heavy artillery."
1,Bad Company,"Never received item even after all there excuses. They don't tell you something is out of stock like advertised. Next excuse, it was damaged going out of door. Had to cancel order. What a waist of time. Better shop somewhere else besides these people.If you e-mail them you will only get another excuse, beside them telling you that you are confused. O, by the way, I hope this helps there ratings. Have a bad day, not you, them."
5,Possibly my favorite album of '06,"I'll admit that it took me a while to appreciate this album. If you come to this album expecting it to sound like a third Belly album, you will be disappointed. However, once you spend some time with it, the country-tinged melodies and Tanya's beautiful vocals really take hold. All of the songs have a wonderfully intimate feel to them, and it's easy to forget that this is a ""live"" album. I highly recommend buying this as an entire album and not just cherry-picking songs as it comes alive when listened to from start to finish (a rare treat these days, it seems). That being said, personal favorites include ""Kundalini Slide"" and ""River Girls,"" with Tanya's amazing version of the Beatles ""Long, Long, Long"" being the high point of the album."
3,Unique but not much fun to listen to,"I love Tanya but I don't have much nice to say about this CD. I've driven around with it for two days now and I can't find any tracks I really like. I think I prefer her catchier, more melodic stuff. I also think there are too many vocals on this and her voice actually seems grating and monotonous. Maybe it's the way it was mastered. Seems to be blasting 100% Tanya all the time, with fuzzy guitars and violins swirling around her occasionally. I can't take it. This CD really does belong in the bargain bin."
2,Disappointed,"I think there may be a little too much ""country"" feel to the selections this artist performs, which is not up my alley. However, I can see she is talented, and country/folk fans would probably enjoy the disc very much."
1,always way overated,"the early 4ad stuff was only o.k. looks like its all downhill from this point on. great bands like hood, bark pychosis, even former 4ad label mates getoverlooked. when my band toured the u.k. ifound that great bands like bark pychosis, disci inferno, cindytalk, insides not getting any credit for there cutting edge music. sad really. pick up any insides cd , if you can find them that is. kristy yates, and serge tardo, two artists way ahead of there time 1 star"
4,Great First Step,"Kent's book is very easy to follow and offers a real nice introduction to Ansys. It's a fast read and the exercise are easy. It would be fantastic if Kent would put out a sequel covering more difficult issues such as contact elements, fracture, and nonlinear analysis"
4,Travels to Peru,"Erudite and complex. Worth the effort. And reading his writing takes an effort. As in mining, it takes effort to get the gold."
3,wild suspicions just confirmed,"Vargas Llosa is a great writer, with a fantastic routine, able to throw offenjoyable and moving stuff even when not in top form. So I cannot say I did notenjoy a lot in this book (even if it does not measure up to The Conversation in the Cathedral or theWar of the End of the World), but found some serious weaknesses. First, this isVargas Llosa's first literary creation after the failed presidential bid inPeru. This makes it is hard not to read as sour grapes: Peru did not elect me,well, it is an irrational, atavistic country anyway. Second, despite themystery story form, hardly any surprises are coming. From the very beginning,Lituma is pondering the same suspicion aboutthe three disappearances and the role ofthe diabolic innkeeper couple. Theend just brings more and more confirmation. The very simpleparallel love story of the young civil guard is saved from banality only by the human touch the writer can lend it."
3,Difficult Read!,"Death in the Andes is not an easy read and will not qualify as your easy & interesting read. This is because there are just too many characters that get introduced into the plot all of a sudden.The interactions between corporal Lituma and his deputy Tomas with a backdrop of remote Andean mountains and villages is the probably the only interesting part of the book. Vargas is able to skillfully shuffle between the past and the present.This is a very small book, but I am struggling to finish it only because it seems to lack the allure that will keep me hooked late in the night."
3,An oblique look at a horrible situation.,"The protagonists are two civil guards alone in a small mining town threatened by guerrillas, and the loss of work. The town is the home of a couple with a Dionysian bent, and an apparent belief in rituals over a 1000 years old. Plot lines include the disappearance of 3 people, the past infatuation of one of the guards, and the guerrilla movement. What the book is really about is the poverty and degradation of the people, and the apparent hopelessness. Vargas writes about this obliquely, so as not to overwhelm the reader, while getting the point across. While I liked the book, I didn't fully appreciate the Dinonysian aspect, I guess, which was a major drawback for me. Vargas uses an interesting technique of seamlessly switching between voice and time, and back, without confusing the reader."
3,Bare bones edition.,"Since all reviews of different editions are lumped together, this review is to tell what is in the edition whose Publisher is CreateSpace (June 11, 2012), 348 pages. This is a print on demand book - just the text of the Idylls of the King, and a generic cover. No additional information whatsoever. It's 10 inches by 8 inches, unnecessarily big - achieved by a lot of extra white space. The Table of Contents lists the ""Dedication"" and ""The Coming of Arthur"" as one entry titled ""The Round Table"". Otherwise it appears to be correct and readable. However, I think I will buy the Penguin edition instead and toss this one."
1,Blurrerd enlarged copied text on slippery bright white paper,"Horrible blurry poorly copied large print on glaring white shiny paper. Give me an old book with yellowed paper and a magnifying glass over this.I could not return as it is too late, but this will be relegated to the bottom shelf - no coffee table book - worst presentation of a book I've seen since high school text books with cheap slippery paper. Clearly a cheaply made enlarged copy of original text. Difficult to read"
1,Review for General Books LLC edition - NOT the Penguin edition,"The General Books LLC edition is a terrible edition of Idylls of the King. I guess the first clue for me should have been the name on the cover - Alfred Tennyson Tennyson?? How about Alfred Lord Tennyson. Also, the price was ridiculous, especially considering this edition isn't even broken up by idylls and the idylls themselves aren't broken the way Tennyson intended. That's what I get for buying a book in a hurry and not taking the time to see what else was available. I've since bought a Penguin edition and it is MUCH better. It is in the format Tennyson intended and many of the archaic words Tennyson used are defined in the back of the book. The only positive things I can say about this edition is the binding seems to be good quality and the pages are made of good stock. But, worth $32?? Nope"
3,King Arthur Legend,"Here is an inexpensive way to acquire the 10,000 line free verse poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson that pretty much sums up the Arthur legends from beginning to end. Along the way are some memorable phrases that can and should be committed to memory to enhance our lives from time to time."
4,19th Century Camelot: An Impossible Ideal,"Tennyson's poetic version of Arthurian legend is inspiring and beautifully cadenced. If you are unfamiliar with the foundational tales of the Round Table this may not be the version to start out with...particularly if you also don't read poetry very often. If, however, you are familiar with Arthur, Guinevere, Galahad, and the rest of the Table, Tennyson's interpretation of the tales as a cautionary illustration of the impossible futility of human ideals juxtaposed with human frailty is moving. Feminists may find the focus on Guinevere's culpability in the destruction of the ideal difficult to stomach, but when viewed as a tale of its time (ie. 19th century) the contrasts between the Victorian Camulodian ideal and the 20th and 21st century interpretations of the legend are intriguing."
5,A Dance Compilation To Die For,"This superlative double CD compilation distils the essence of the famed U.K. clubnight hosted by Lee Burridge, Craig Richards and Sasha. Burridge and Richards are on deck duties and create a thrilling blueprint for the 21st Century dancefloor, gliding from deeply funky breakbeats to cutting edge house and techno sounds. While many of the artists on this compilation may be unfamiliar to the uninitiated we are fortunate to have two of the dance scene's most discerning palates on programming duties. Featuring tracks by Attaboy, Los Diablos Locos and Layo and Bushwacka this CD represents the zenith of club compilations; brilliantly programmed and mixed and featuring a marvellous array of obscure, underground gems. This is 2000's unmissable dance compilation! On a similar theme and of a similarly high quality is 'Yoshiesque' mixed by Washington's finest, Deep Dish. You won't be disappointed!"
3,the rebel empire,"well, for those of you who read this, you will be getting somewhat of a feel for what lies ahead in this book. As the title for this review somewhat implies, it greatly involves the imperial remnant. In this book, the empire learns that they are not invincible as the Vong attempt to take over their little corner of the galaxy, the tide of battle is turned only when the jedi appear on the scene on a mission for the Galactic Alliance. the jedi teach the empire how to survive in a fire fight and after some close calls, the empire finally wins the battle to survive and fight another day. later on the empire realizes that they need to join, at least militarily with the Galactic Alliance in order for the Empire to survive this war. there is also a subplot involvng Nom Anor and the shamed ones which some might find kind of interesting. overall it was a good read."
5,Great intro to the Trillogy,This is a great first book to the Force Heretic trilogy. Sometimes the first book can be boring setting up the story for books 2 & 3 but this one was exciting and action packed.
4,this series is slowing down,"whoever originally came up with the ideal for this series was brilliant. 15 books later and fans like me still are clamoring for more. unfortunately, the original excitement is slowing down. this book has luke, mara and jacen looking for the only known living planet that may have repelled the yuuhzan vong years ago. instead they run into the yuuhzan fighting their own enemy the empire. choices, choices.meanwhile, han, leia and jania are off on a diplomatic mission to several worlds to find out why all communications have been lost. they go wandering is there a planet left? have the yuuhzan struck again? this book is building up to a climatic ending and i see that it has two more parts so i hope the story eventually picks up a little more steam that it has so far. but for all star wars fans it has enough interest to read it. just not enough to break your neck to go and buy it."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I liked this book for the most part, but there are things that could have made it better. I would have liked alot more scenes with Jaina and Jag. Danni and Jacen get on my nerves. What about Tenal Ka? In previous books, didn't she have feelings for Jacen? Why isn't she brought into the picture? I also don't really like the way that Tahiri is having the psychological problems. She's proved herself strong in the other books, why have her break down now? Truthfully, I wish Aron Allston was writing this trilogy. He's been, by far, my favorite Star Wars novelist. Especially the Wraith Squadron series."
2,Not worth the wait,"I was waiting for the book. The aftermath of the downfall of Tsvong Lah and how the enemy would regroup. Nothing. I plot and undetstanding what their goals are is unclear. Why are Mara and Luke stikcking around in a fight witha slaveship when they could be off in the unknow regions for the last month?? Poor Ben will never get to see his scatterbrained parents that way...I would like to see Jaina and Jag develop or die away and I wish someone would come along for Kyp, just like they did for Lando. It is definately a one step forward two step back novel..I would have been really mad if I had had to pay for hardcover on this."
3,Force Heretic I: Remnant,"I enjoyed the basic plot of the story and I liked the mystery that surrounded several of the characters. Also, I enjoyed the freshness of the new and novel ways in how some of the problems faced were solved. I did feel like, however, I was reading one of the Rogue novels because there was so much detail on the space fights. So much detail in fact that the main plot is forgotten or lost. Old information was repeated and basically the book felt like a lot of small stories put hapzardly together. Over all, I do not think this was one of the best Star Wars books I have read except for certain bits and pieces."
5,this book trilogy is amazing this book is #15 in the NJO Book Series,this book seriously is amazing from the very begining to the very end the new jedi order book series is amazing from the very begining to the very end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,I really didn't like any of the NJO series.,"I have read almost all of the SW universe novels... and the NJO series was painful to read. By far the worst SW-EU noel series (and of course the longest). I only read this series because I started reading the Legacy of The Force series that came after the NJO and those books kept referencing back to things that happened during the Vong war that I didn't know about... so I read the NJO series... almost every book in this 19 book series was boring, poorly written, predictable and incredibly dry. I would only recommend reading this series if you are just DYING to know what went down in the war word-for-word. If you can live with the abridged version, look it up on Wikipedia or something and find out the main details."
3,"sort of dull, but still entertaining","this is the first adult star wars book i have read. it took halfway through the book just to get to the first lightsaber duel, which wasn't really a duel at all! had good cover art, though.there were good things about this book and bad things. entertaining, but if you want a better read, i recommend destiny's way."
1,suicide from boredom,I am stuck in a terrible position. My OCD really wants me to finish this book but I do not. This book is horribly written. At least every 5 mi uses I fund myself seriously wondering what is going in. I don k ow who the people are in the conversation or what they are talking about. Then I will keep reading and slowly start to figure out a little bit ... then BAM! Same thing happens. 2 writers did nothing but make this book confusing. Don't read this unless you absolutely can't help yourself.
3,Just average...,"I wasn't pleased with Force Heretic (all 3). All 3 books felt disjointed. I know authors frequently use this tactic to create suspense, but Williams and Dix don't seem to know how to make that happen without feeling like I'm being jerked around. The story line could very easily have been condensed to 1 book and still accomplished the same end result."
1,Worst 3 Books of the Series,"This book and the 2 that follow are easily the 3 worst books in the series. These 3 books should have been 1 book instead of 3. They are slow and full of usless jabber. If these books had been combined into 1 book, the one book would still be a poor story, but at least we wouldn't have had to wade through page after page of crap."
2,Weak links in the NJO chain,"This is a general comment on all three Force Heretic books. These are some of the weakest books of the series, and found them just barely enjoyable and then only because I enjoy the Star Wars milieu so much. The basic problem is that they make very little sense. After reading the whole series I still have no idea who the ""force heretic"" the title refers to is. And I have only the foggiest idea why the characters think the quest for Zonama Sekot is important. While we're on the subject, the characters are poorly drawn and their actions make little sense. The whole thing is so weak that the books just aren't a lot of fun."
3,Good but not that good,"Starts out rather slow, but picks up momentum near the end of the book. Not nearly as much information to digest as Destiny's Way, but i think it lacked physical action. For the most part its kind of aerial and strategic, more behind the scenes. It is still a good read if you enjoy the series though."
3,Cute Cake But Candles Don't Work,"This is a cute cake and my daughter enjoys playing with it, but the candles do not keep their lights up. They fall down inside the candles and there is no way to keep them staying up, to look like the candles are lit. We have thoroughly tried. She still plays with this cake set, as it is cute and the cake pieces are different colors inside and velcro together, so she can cut them apart. Just don't expect the candles to work though. For the price we paid, around $8, it is a fine purchase still. It just would be nice if they had provided candle tops that worked on this cake, when they originally made this toy. My daughter has gotten frustrated with the candles not working, so I had to explain their problem to her so she wouldn't keep getting upset with them."
3,Candle lights don't stay up,"I had to put some sticks to keep the "" lights"" on on the candles.Also they don't stay firm over the cake.Don't recommend."
3,birthday play,We have the set with the cake and ice cream. The idea is great and my kids like it but you have to have luck when trying to keep the flames up. Sometimes they stay up and sometimes they don't. The candles are wrapped in paper so you cannot get them wet or wash them.
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,"Do not buy this toy cake, it is ABSOLUTE JUNK! It is VERY small, two of the four candles won't fit into the cake, and the most frustrating to my girls is the flames in the candles don't stay up (not even for one second!) I've emailed Stewart Toys and I've called them and I don't get a response! They don't answer their phone and they don't respond to emails. I can't even return this piece of junk! I need to contact Amazon to figure out what to do. Just some advice... DON'T PURCHASE FROM STEWART TOYS! They don't stand behind their junky toys! Their toy pizza that I bought is very junky as well and the pizza cutter already broke. What's ironic about this whole thing is... if you look them up on the internet, the owner of Stewart Toys wrote about himself bragging that he started his toy business due to lack of quality toys out there... I honestly feel the two that I purchased from him are the lowest quality I've ever purchased for my kids!!"
3,It is as described by previous buyers....,"For the price, its ok...grandson has fun playing with it which is the point....but, oh, the candle flames....each review noted them so I knew what I was getting...you would think there was a way to allow them the latch upward....but, amazingly, they WILL not stand up.....frustrating for adults, kids adjust."
3,Candles don't stay,Got this cake for my 32month old and she was so excited with it but then was so frustrated when candles wouldn't stay on cake so she didn't play with it for long. It's a small cake. I had to take candles away from her because it was upsetting her when she tried to give me a piece of cake with candle and the candle would fall.
5,Shooting Star Silent Scream-Masterpiece!,I'm so glad this CD is back in print. I wore out the cassette of this years ago from playing it to death in the 80's. There isn't a bad song on this album. Ron Nevison did a great job producing this album.This one of my favorite hard rock albums. Don't Stop Me Now is mind blowing. Summer Sun was the hit off this CD but there should have been many more if more people knew about this band. This CD was one of the best of the 80's by far.
4,Unbelievable! Finally released...,"WOW! The most underrated, unappreciated band of the 80's. What a great collection of songs..true 80's rock. Gary and Van were true magic together. I went through 2 Silent Scream albums and a cassette, and now this album can be heard as it should be. Summer Sun and I'm Getting Out are great, hard driving rock songs that really get your heart pumping. I would highly recommend this, along with any of the earlier albums to anyone who grew up listening to and loving the 80's music scene."
2,"another poor choice, of mine,","the music was not what I expected, my comment is please please put up samples for all cds...... would not have bought...."
5,Awesome!,"This is, in my opinion, one of the best albums ever made. Every song is good, most are great! This album is more keyboard oriented than previous Shooting Star material, but it still rocks. Gary West is an awesome vocalist, and their sound is truly unique."
2,Journey Lite,I ordered this CD & the 1st 2 CD's based on review claiming cross between Foghat & Journey. This CD arrived 1st. Very disappointed. It was a TOTAL ripoff of Journey. Where was the Foghat Sound?? then i thought Crap i have 2 more of thier CD's coming yet.What a Surprise. The 1st 2 are really good and They Rock and no Journey Ripoff Sound here
5,Finally don't have to muscle the steering.,"This cable is the exact replacement that I was looking for. Bolted right up to steering wheel , nice to have normal steering again."
2,MARINE STEERING,"FROM THE SAME COMPANY BUT WOULD NOT FIT MY EXISTING HELM. BACK TO AMAZON TO ORDER A NEW ""PACKAGE DEAL"" LETS SEE WHAT THEY HAVE IN STORE"
3,Clamp-on bow light,"Molded body battery flashlight & aluminum clamp. Economical, but light duty. Probably Chinese ...... Satisfactory for occasional use, as I need. I would seek a higher quality unit if I used it often. I doubt the contacts would last through a season of boating."
3,Good book but incomplete,"Very easy to understand language, I read through it in 1 night. My overall review is positive.But few things which I didn't like are :1. Author keeps talking about the ""Magic Formula"" over and over again as if it is some wizardry. If he had kept a professional tone and just explained the concepts, it would have left a much better impression than sounding so cheesy.2. I call it incomplete, because he should have dedicated a chapter on how you would use the ""Magic Formula"" starting from what you do after you see the 30 stocks. He could have walked us through buying those and probably monitoring how they are doing instead of holding the losers and winners blindly for a year.3. Finally, the 30 stocks that were shown to me from the website, 3 were very shady and even almost falling into penny stock land with major drops in prices. I would have loved it if next to your picks you provide commentary on how they really fit the magic formula.Overall still a good read, I think."
3,good,I found the book helpful in certain aspects but confusing when explaining wht the magic formula was effective as the comparisons were in one point stated how effective it was then in the next chapter to say that there were years the magic formula did not work.
1,"Repetitive and Technical , not a fundamentalist","The whole book just emphasizes on the magic formula, overly repetitive on one thing.The magic formula is more suitable for technical people, or people who are lazy to analyze a company.I, as a fundamentalist who follows Warren Buffett, do not find this book useful."
1,"""I missed the Boat!""","This is a quote out of Joel's third book ""The Big Secret For The Small Investor"" p13, that he himself said about this book. Indeed he did miss the boat! You cannot ""boil"" the Stock Market down to a magic formula. If you could everybody would be doing it. His excuse for this is that you have to use his formula over many years and suffer many down years to reap the benefits - ouch! As a retired investor of many years I have come to realize that a good portfolio of the right kind of index funds can trounce most all other ""magic formulas."" This is now what I recommend to anyone willing to listen!Don't wast your money on any of Joel's books, at least written up to this point in 2012."
1,Don't waste your money.,This book is not worth toilet paper - which is long on fiction and short on fact. Don't waste your money.
1,"Small Book, Thin Content","The author introduced a stock picking method at the beginning... stuffed barely relevant, or almost irrelevant, information in the body of the book (I would suggest you to skip them all)... and return to the stock picking method at the final chapter. He did not forget to promote his own web site in that chapter.If you already know what value investing is, this book is as thin as air to you."
2,There is no such thing as magic formula,"Even a magic formula fails once it is exposed, just like Benjamin Grahm's formula. This formula has worked only for a certain number of years only in US markets. If the same formula would have applied to Japanese market for last 16 years, it would fail. That's why the international stocks are made a 'convenient exception.' I would keep analysing this theory, but certainly won't risk any money on this."
5,The Little Book,If you are interested in the stock market this is a book that everyone needs to read. The information is presented in a very readable and entertaining format. The author makes some claims reqarding past performance. I would have liked to have seen more information on the methods used to achieve these returns so that they could be confirmed by other investors.
2,Minimally informative and very repetitive,"This book presents a very clear explanation of how stocks work. Unfortunately, the author stretches it out, painfully repeating the concepts and interspersing the text with lame jokes. Read the two pages towards the end where it explains the steps of his amazingly simple methodology: that is pretty much all you need to know.As for the ""magic"" formula, the author is careful enough to lower expectations in the short run, allowing enough time for people to buy his book, use the formula and maybe find out 6-7 yrs down the road that it was all bull.Still, I would agree it's a good primer for teens and clueless adults on how the stock market works."
2,Unimpressive,This book is only a promotional piece to drive people to his website. If you have any knowledge of the basic principles of investing this book will bore you.
2,Strictly for very conservative Traders.,"It is an interesting concept but unrealistic in today's market.Who will wait years through thick and thin for certain ""hopefully"" underpriced companies to emerge with glowing profits. A good read but not for the active investor in today's stock market which is teeming with booming company profits. Why wait years when you can accomplish results within one year?"
4,A sound investment philosophy,"This books greatest insight is not that it gives the formula to rank companies but that it gives a simple investment philosophy. The heart of the little book is that you stick with this philosophy over a long time horizon. The book does not promise short term gains (i.e. gains within 3 years), what it does is explain why the philosophy will work in the long term and gives evidence that can be confirmed by independent sources (some articles on the web have confirmed his findings). The biggest flaw of the book is that it does not give a real world example of how to calculate the earnings yield and return on capital and since these values are not based purely from values on a financial statement the independent investor will be stuck with his Greenblatt's website to find companies; the website is free for now."
1,The little book that could NOT,"My husband and I are the type of suckers this book aims at. If you want to quickly lose money invest in Joel Greenblatts Formula Investing. Within 9 months we lost 10% of the $100,000 we invested. The premise is wrong. Information is pervasive. If his team knows an undervalued stock so does the entire market, and it's no longer a bargain. We had rosy expectations but we should have read the negative reviews here first. We are getting out."
3,Just a introduction for the website and formula,I expected a lot before reading this book but almost everything was covered in the video introduction in the website which I had watched before. I find it not really worthy buying and reading ~150 pages page by page. ok for a quick screening.
4,Great book on value investing....,"I loved this book, it gives you the basics of value investing in less than 2 hours, using P/E ratio & ROA. A quick formula to judge stocks based on the growth and value. No long, complicated, wordy explanations many people use to obscure how to properly select stocks. I learned a lot in this book, especially when I try to asses the value of a company in very short time; however, I would use some technical charting to these results to improve the results."
5,This is a great book!,"No matter your level of stock investing experience is, you'll enjoy reading this book. You will learn plenty without a lot of needless jargon being used. It is a quick and entertaining read. Highly recommended!"
4,phussy phred,"This is an interesting ""Little Book."" The biggest reason I did not give this book a 5 star rating was that a person will need a bit of money behind them to test and establish the validity of Mr. Greenblatt's ideas.That said, I found the book an easy read and if anything the author could have even shortened it further....so much seemed redundant to me. Mr. Greenblatt should be commended for bringing his data and information to the masses.Here's to making a bunch of money using the very simply ""magicformula"" proposed in this ""Little Book."" I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in increasing their net worth and/or adding to their retirement kitty and feeling safe about what they are doing."
3,"Two very good financial points, but...","the entire book could have been written in 30-50 pages. So much of it was surplusage and overkill, but his core points are very relevant and very powerful."
3,Lots of fluff,155 little book pages should have been boiled down to about 5 real pages. And that would have included a one page glossary. I use a similar system of stock selection for an initial watch list. I then use technical analysis to select buy and sell points. It works for me...
2,Is it really magical?,"I doubted. If anyone can find more data to support his ""theory"", I will be pleased. The book provided a formula for us to follow. If stock picking is such easy thing, Peter Lynch would not retire so early. I am the follower of Peter Lynch, all I read from this book seemed useless for me.Again, if more evidences are provided, the magical formula will be much more attractive and, believable."
2,Was that a point that just rolled across the floor?,"Absolutely attrocious. After making the very solid points of buying stock in companies that have a high return on capital and a high return on investment. Then Greenblatt drones on and on. In the end, the book gives a mechanical trading system that uses absolutely no refinement. The system would have you trading in BB and OB stocks that don't event have revenues! Come on Prof G! Give us something that has some thought to it....not just a model that worked. And, OBTW, he never ""future tested"" the model. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This book is of no consequence to readers who are interested in investing shrewdly."
3,little book,The book was more or less a rehash of imformation I have read in prior books on the subject.
1,"All Gimmick, Some Hype","As another reviewer states, save your money. This is a little book with some interesting thoughts, but the whole ""little book"" is for the direct purpose of hyping his website, which you log onto and give your e-mail address and such, and he will give you, supposedly, some ""magic formula"" in response. The reality? The reality, if you are foolish enough to give the info to his website (as I was) is that...you get no ""magic formula"" in return. If you care enough to send an e-mail to the contacts address, you get a form e-mail stating that there must be some problem on your end getting ""registered."" Funny to have a form e-mail that states such a thing as an automatic, general response to ALL inquiries, right? Guess why. So..there you have it. The purpose of the book. Save your money for books by real financial wizards who have real advice to give you. This isn't one of them."
1,Don't waste your money,"Got almost to the end, realized it was a book a book about funds, almost through my kindle against the wall. Waste of time and money."
1,No magic in this formula.,"This book is a waste of money. You might as well take any retirement savings and go to Vegas, because following this magic formula would be as much of a crap shoot as that."
4,Enjoyable light read on a very serious topic,Well worth a read and a good start for the beginning or intermediate investor who wants to beat the market over time.
5,A Great Starting Point for Value Investing,"The Little Book That Beats The Market is a great starting point for those interested in value investing. It's especially relevant for beginners. Greenblatt clearly and simply explains what makes a stock a good value investment, and the core theory of ""buying great companies at low prices"" is a simple definition of value investment. For beginners, following the strategy outlined in the book should offer excellent investment returns.For more experienced investors, the ""Magic Formula"" makes a great initial screen. Using the ""Magic Formula"" results, you have a list of promising investments to research. In fact, there are websites like [...] that attempt to do just that.A short, fun, and profitable read for beginners or experienced investors, I highly recommend this book."
2,"""Formula"" does not reconcile with financial statements","The financial metrics of most of the stocks on his ""magic"" list DO NOT match the financial statements of those companies, if you apply the same ""formula"" as described in the book. And many of those stock rankings are off even measured by his own metrics. The readers just have to take as they are. There's no validations!"
2,Don't consider buying it...,"This is such a short and unsubstantial book- do not bother buying it. Go to your local book store or library, buy the coffee drink of your choice. You can read this in 1 1/2 hours. As others have said, it is written to the 5th grade level. As for the method shown in the book and the website, I would never use only a single simple tool alone. If you want to read a REAL book about this topic, read books by James O'Shaughnessy or by William O'Neil."
3,Fun book but low on content.,"This book is fun to read, but has very little actual information. The whole book is dedicated to a single simple trading strategy. Joel's Magic Formula."
3,oversimplified,"Good book to give to someone who have no idea how to become stock investors, but it's too simplistic and i feel like the author thinks i am a 4th grader without any financial knowledge."
3,Way too simple to be useful!,"In this book, two factors are definde as the ""magic formula"": a high yield to price ratio and a high return on capital. This fundamental value principle is way too simple to be useful. The most helpful part of the book is the statement that most ""magic formula"" will deliver less than the market return for a period of time, e.g. one or even two years. You have to have faith in it to reap the benefits of the formula. Other books, such as the Poor Dad and Rich Dad, deliver more useful advises."
2,"Sorry, but I dont get all the praise....","I normally don't take the time to write a review, but.... after seeing all the positive reviews (which provoked my purchasing the book) I felt compelled to offer my opinion. I am a successful trader and am always looking for an edge and am eager to learn something new, or at a minimum discover some thought provoking ideas. I purchased this book believing it would satisfy at least one of these requirements. I am sad to report that the book for me was extremely disappointing and was SO basic and SO fundamental I had the feeling it may have been written for a 5 year old (as the author eludes to from time to time). I guess if you know absolutely NOTHING about fundamentals and valuations it may be of some use.If you are looking for an informative and well written book on investing.. look for another book."
4,Good introduction to Value Investing,This book provides a great primer (or refresher) course in the most basic tenents of investing.
1,Save your time and money,"A total waste of time and money for me, all in the book can be said in one sentence, which was already in Benjamin Graham's investment principle, and was much better put in Graham's words. The whole book is very repetitive, keep repeating the same thing over and over. The worst investment book I have ever read."
2,Watchout for Greebblatt!,"I bought 20 stocks with Greenblatt's list. Two quarters later i have lost 25 percent of my capital. Of the 20 stocks i picked from his list, only 8 are now on his list 5 months later!!! Wow!! What changed with his numbers SO quickly? Watch out for the Hussler!! You would think that Greenblatt already has enough money and wouldn't need to milk the consumer anymore with yet another book."
2,Save Your Money,"What do you get when you mix a strong marketing plan, a well known and successful hedge fund manager, and 100 pages of investing platitudes?Answer: Greenblatt's new book.I hate to be so harsh on the book, because I think Greenblatt's intentions are good.So let me correct myself: If you are under the age of 12 and know diddley squat about how stocks work, buy this book.You'll learn a lot.Now, if you have even a rudimentary knowledge of stock picking -- save your money.Greenblatt says two important things in this book then repeats himself for 100 + pages.All you need to know you could have gotten for free at Morningstar: buy companies with high ROC (return on assets or ""ROA"") and high earnings yield (inverse of P/E ratio -- the E/P ratio)."
3,Pretty good,"Although I was hoping for a big-picture theology about investing, this book is a happy counter-balance to that kind of thinking. It offers a somewhat rigid, long-term investing strategy that (if his math is right) truly does crush market averages over a period of time. Probably most convincing were the author's arguments for the advantages of patience and the thoroughly documented success of his ""magic formula."" It is much too sexy a name for what he's suggesting. Perhaps a better phrase would be ""sensible investing that, over time, cannot lose.""I also liked that even though Greenblatt is utterly excited and at times almost childishly promotional about his strategy, he stops short of any promises about what the economic picture might look like in the future. This is a number crunching strategy that ignores trends, defies gut beliefs and is oblivious to sector, industry or global politics. It is not a particularly ""wise"" volume, but it certainly felt right."
2,waste of a lot of time,"lots of stories about his son, Sailing, teaching, simple humor etc and about 10 minutes of real advice on how to select companies to invest in based on two beliefs regarding earnings and returns. VEry Basic book more for teenagers. I'm no big investment garu but....I would save the money and buy something with some substance."
1,This is a fairy tale,"This guy can't be serious. The recommended investment strategy boils down to 1) read my book 2) consult my website 3) blindly follow my recommendations. There is no way to replicate the results on your own. Actually, there's no way even to understand _exactly_ how the results are achieved. (Adjustments for 'excess' cash? Really? How is that derived?)I don't doubt the author has achieved great results himself - but the book is little more than a fairy tale."
2,read at the bookstore!,"I didn't want to buy this book because it could be read in 2 and a half hours at the book store. The book is about 150 pages and about 5 of them are worth reading. If you just read the appendix you can save yourself a lot of time because that is the whole book. The rest of the book is the author trying to be cute and telling stupid stories.The author says if you buy stocks with high earnings yields and return on capital you will beat the market. However, he uses EBIT/enterprise value for the earnings yield. I don't know why he doesn't use free cash flow instead of EBIT. The author also tells you to turnover 100% of your portfolio each year, but ignores taxes when he shows the results for his ""magic formula."" He also ignores transaction costs (especially important for those that have small sums of money or don't use a discount broker).If his magic formula works then it works and it is hard to argue with facts. However, save yourself the money and read it at the book store."
4,Great for Beginners and Intermediates,This is a nicely written book by an expert in the field. It is very easy to read and informative for beginners and intermediates. The main idea in the book is to buy stocks of companies that are likely to have good growth (high ROE) and that are sold at a discount (low P/E). The concepts are very simple yet very powerful. Greenblatts writing is very enjoyable to read. I definitely recommend this book for beginners and intermediates.
3,Lots of Guidance for a Simple Idea,"This is indeed a little book, and it could easily be littler. If you skip to the 14th chapter, which is at the very end, you finally find the real meat. His method seems plausible enough and he has supposedly tested it historically. In a nutshell he tells you to buy 5 to 7 low PE, high ROA stocks every 3 or 4 months for one year. Then, after about a year (less for losers, more for winners,taking advantage of capital gain rules), sell that group of stocks and pick an equal number of similar replacements. He's even done the statistical work by listing appropriate choices on his updated free website. Now, you don't even have to get the book, eh? That is, unless you want to know where to find appropriate stocks or why his method is historically a wining method."
3,decent guidelines for beginning to intermediate investors,"The good thing about this book is that it teaches value investing, which is the only investing style that works in the long run. To his credit the author does pay homage to those who came before him-- namely Ben Graham, and like Graham he formulates a magic investing formula to identify stocks that have the potential to beat the market. The magic formula emphasizes stocks that have both a high return on capital and a high earnings yield. That is the book in a nut-shell.The magic formula will lead investors to stocks the market has temporarily placed on sale. However, there are a number of caveats to be aware of and additional research is required before blindly buying the stocks identified by the formula. The book provides a solid argument for self-directed investing and a framework for doing so. The trick, as always, is how to apply the wisdom found in the book and having the guts to stick with it even in periods of underperformance."
3,Expected more from the genius,Pros:Lucid presentation.Plain and simple makes it ideal for the beginners in stock market.Magic formula and his step-by-step are both rational and practical.Cons:If you have an advanced degree like MBA or CPA skip this book.Book doesn't talk about the importance of Cash flowNo discussion regarding General Allocation strategies and Diversification strategies.Comment:He is probably going to write another book carrying his tips and techniques from real life experience. At-least I wish...
2,website spams,"I enjoyed the content of the book - I would give it 4 stars easy. I do not really have anything to add about the content of the book. I did want to add that, after I signed up for the book's web site I started receiving stock spam that has only been accelerating over the past few weeks and it is driving me nuts. 3 to 4 emails a day. I would recommend using a special spam-only email address if you want to sign up for the web site."
3,Good book....Need to discuss risks also...,"Good investing doesn't have to be complicated. If the simplist approach makes money, then why not use it? I think Greenblatt does a good job of explaining how to invest for the long term using a very simple method. He even backs up the strategy with empirical studies.One thing I do not like about the book is that he doesn't discuss enough about possible risks of his strategy... Just because you run some historical numbers, that doesn't mean it's going to work in the future..."
2,Are you a Trader or Investor? -- Traders Stay Away...,"This book is about buying value, and value stocks. This means you can sit on these stocks a long time. The author (in a market wizard book) stated ""Buying good companies at low prices will show a profit. It may take 2 months, or 2 years but eventually you will be right""Can you hold on to a losing stock for 2 years hoping it will come back? Not me. I trade maybe holding a stock from 1 to 5 days on average. It it keeps going my way I hold on longer. I cannot hope a cheap stock I bought works out in 2 years. I do not have time to wait or time to keep researching a losing position.So if you are a buy and hold investor and can sit on a loss for years and have tons of time for research then this book may be a good choice for you.From my point of view 2 stars, someone else that invests for the LONG TERM could give this book 5 stars."
3,"Interesting, but superficial","The book's main idea is interesting, but the author does not develop the ideas in detail. For instance he doesn't explain how much should you buy of each share (100, weighted by mkt cap, equal amounts). The author should review the topic detailing the strategy more deeply."
2,Short story said long way,"You just have to read 134 to 144 page. Book dragged the same topic over and over again. Also the magic formula was actually explained in the pages I listed above, which was not explained in details earlier. Currently fidelity, moneycentral.msn.com they all have stored searches for this kind of formula.The good thing about this book is little and you can finish it fast, but what you need is really those 11 pages."
3,A too little book,"I bought the book as a filler to get the free shipping (I did read a positive book review of it) and was a little disappointed after reading the entire book. I agree with most of these non-5-star reviews and will not repeat these comments/points. The only point I try make is that systematically maintaining a 20-30 stocks portfolio is not an easy task to take, at least not for an average individual investor."
2,"Good Basics, but cannot stand alone","The financial information and ""Investing Philosopy"" is explained very well and is easy to understand- even without any financial background.My problem is that by the end of the book, even if you believe everything, you remain dependent on the authors website to actually choose the companies to invest in. The author emphasizes that the time horizon for his investing philosophy should be at least 3 years. For small investors, the necessary tools to apply his formula are not available elsewhere, so what happens if the website is not available after a year?If I had some assurance that the website would be available, I would give it 5-stars. Without the website, the book is just an interesting theory with no means for a small investor to apply it."
4,Great Read but...,"The Little Book is great reading and educational; however, I found it difficult to make this author's recommendations actionable. Most of the book tells you to follow the ""magic formula"", but then tells you that it might not work in the short-term or long-term. I have a problem with any formulaic approach to making money in the market, let alone beating the market. Having said that, I was pleased to have read the book as it did open my eyes to new concepts of investing judgement and history."
4,"Interesting, easy read, but practical?","This book was quick and pleasant to read. The track record of his investment strategy is certainly impressive. However, in order to follow his plan, you would need to divest yourself of any holdings which did not meet his qualifications, and be prepared to follow the strategy for a minimum of five years. We read this in my Investment Club, and did not choose to employ his plan. If you keep investing in the stock market, odds are good that you will make money over time, but there is still no ""sure thing!"""
3,very disappointed,"I felt the contents of the book were interesting and probably do work. What I found out by the end of the book is that they used this book to sell their website. The book until that point had my interest, but as soon as they tried to sell their website, I became disappointed with it."
4,Great little investment book,"I've always thought that investing shouldn't be that hard (now speculation or gambling - that's a different story!): find a good company, give them some money, make a decent return. Greenblatt helps you along that path with this book. I like the book in that anyone can follow his advice. He lays out his formulas in a very easy and readable style and supports them with quite a bit of statistical evidence. Greenblatt's advice will seem pretty boring to a lot of investors who live for the thrill of an options spread but he seems to have a good plan for long term buy-and-hold investing. Seems like a great little book."
4,Very Interesting,Easy to understand facinating concept. The anoying thing is I still havn't started to use the system.M
2,Save your money for stocks instead of this book,"I have to agree with the other reviewers in that this book is not worth your time reading because the ""magic formula"" that is hyped thoughout this book could have been revealed in the first chapter and you could have then moved on to something more important to do.If you have absoulutley no idea about the stock market then this will be a rudementary introduction to the subject. On the other hand if you know anything about P/E, ROA, and enjoy having authors unfold there story to a target audience of pimple faced 13 year olds then I wouldn't bother.Yes, there's an important point about value investing here, but it shouldn't be any suprise to the average invester."
2,"Time is a constant, not a variable","Unhappily, I join the skeptics about this book. Why unhappy? The author tries hard to keep things entertaining, as well as provide a stream of gained-through-experience wisdom. The production values of the book are good, too. But the author's message about what will likely work are not entirely convincing, nor are they that different from what hears from financial analysts on TV or in the newspapers. I suspect that for many investors this book will end up on a shelf, little used, gathering dust, eventually to make its way to charity book sales (used book shops won't want it unless you sell your copy early, as they will be quickly innudated). I found that in investing, energetic/active investing, and luck, are more important than any grand long-term strategies."
1,"This book falls ""short"" in this market.","Having been an investor for years, I expected this ""Little Book"" to be a good review and quick reference. No to both. There is lots of filler and not much ""beef"" here. I cannot recommend this book as a review or a primer if you are just beginning. The time and money invested in purchasing and reading this book does not beat the market in quality books on the subject. Market recommendation: If you own it; sell. If you are considering a purchase; don't."
3,Referance,Very hard for a layman to understand Strictly a reference book. Good for a reference book not easy to read. Good condition
5,Wonderful white rabbit charm!,"Truth is, I have been searching high and low for a charm that I really liked and would be the first charm to start my bracelet with. I really like rabbits and even though I only like the characters from Alice in Wonderland (not the story itself) I went ahead and ordered it. The charm is about the size of the nail on my thumb and it has a very nice weight, so definitely sterling. It's oxidized in all of the right places and looks even better than the photo. I'm really happy that I found a special charm that won't be sold by the millions at the local mall. I was VERY satisfied with the company who mailed it and it came in great packaging on a nice card with info about the Hand and Hammer company who makes these by hand."
4,creative relaxing trance,"one of my favourite albums, with high repeat listenability. loops, synth, voice, soft rhythm, evocative, relaxing, with new nuances constantly being revealed."
1,Garbage. Save your time and money,"A complete mess - all filler and no content. The one star is mandatory, so given grudgingly.Reads like smarty-pants college kid took a Newsweek article and fluffed it out with shaky theories about Aztec mythology, stirred in some other convoluted extrapolations that bore no clear connection to these crimes. Why do factual research when you can waffle and include material on unrelated pet topics?I am no wiser about the subject and I will never get back the four hours I took to read the book."
1,I wasted 20 bucks,"Someone recenty wrote, Without Reservation reads like a John Grisham novel. Well, I read all of Grisham and Benedict is no John Grisham."
4,Worked there... Saw it... This book is on target...,"The Mashantuckets and their managers are experts at re-shaping the truth to suit their single minded wealth goal. Read the book... visit the casino to see Conn's gleaming haven of lies... but PLEASE spend your sightseeing dollar in Mystic (but not the Hilton because they own that) or on a Ferry (but not the high-speed ferry's because they own those) or at the award-winning Norwich Inn & Spa (oops - they own that now too).Well, our region still has nice people... ....................."
2,"Handgun Hunting Stories, not ""The Ultimate Guide""","If you need good solid information about bullet selection and load development or on overcoming the special problems inherent in handgun hunting, don't buy this book. There is some information that can be sifted from the stories if that is how you like to get it. Much of that information is often stating the obvious to someone with a general knowledge of guns. For a book titled ""The Ultimate Guide"" I expected an in-depth treatment of the subject. Not Here."
1,The Ultimate Guide to Handgun Hunting: Tips and Tactics for Hunting Small and Big Game,"I am glad I bought this book cheap. The author assumes you don't know which end of a pistol to point downrange,then launches into lots of undefined jargon. Is more about hunting tales than useful information."
3,Hard to find,"It is a very good cartridge, BUT impossible to buy through local stores like Staples and Office Depot. Must be ordered online ( with shipping charges). Amazon has the best prices, but I feel the cartridges should be available in a store"
4,Four stars,Good prose. Amusing story. This fellow Goodis clearly knew what the battle with demon rum is all about. Likely he or a loved one endured the struggle and faced the bleakness.
4,Tough call,"This book is a tough call for me. On the one hand, the plot depends on a 1 in 1 million event that occurs twice (with slight variation). That's a bit much for me to swallow, especially in a genre where a big part of the illusion is the gritty ""realism"" of the story. On the other hand, I happen to like this kind of writing:""He could see the bottle rising to her lips, and then her lips meeting the lips of the bottle, as though the bottle were something alive, making love to her. . . he saw the bottle as a loathsome, grotesque creature that had lured Doris and captured her and pleasured itself with her, draining the sweet life from her body as it poured its rottenness into her.""If this kind of writing is not quite your style, then this is a book to skip. If this leaves you wanting more, then the improbability of the plot should not stop you from diving in."
5,Polaroid,"A very nice effort from one of the most respected guitar players around. I'd say this resembles hawaiian folk music with strong US blues/rock influences, allthough the voice and guitar-playing of Ry Cooder and his companions really takes it all to another level. There's nothing new, nothing exceptional to be found here - it's this record's spirit that really drives it forward.Oh, and just a comment to the previous reviewer; I think the cover art of this album fits the music quite nicely. It's a picture of a skeleton having a go with what seems to be a hawaiian woman - giving the record an edge while still justifying some of the more strange fusion stuff going on here.Just my 2 cents off course."
3,After about 18 months of using this dinnerware.....,"I think I can give an honest rating of this product. I love the color, but have been disappointed in several areas. Coffee mugs -- size is great, especially for coffee in the morning; handles are just the right size to get a good grip; however, I have had to replace 4 mugs because these same handles 'fell off.' This is not inexpensive to do, either!!! I had tried to glue them back on using super glue, but this just doesn't hold up. Be careful! Dinnerware did not hold up to silver ware -- scratches very easily, especially if you cut food on your plate, even with just a plain butter knife. All in all, I would NOT recommend this dinnerware for everyday use. Quality did not justify the cost -- I purchased service for 8!!!"
2,Good Grief,"The only relatively compelling thing about this movie is the footage of Adolph, Renee and the other crazy old people. The portion of the running time spent watching amateurish iMovie flashing footage or Jonathan being quasi-arrogant by self-indulgently performing in front of the camera is excrutiatingly long and not very interesting. This is being hailed as some sort of revolutionary documentary. It's not. It's an obnoxiously edited half story filled with almost-interesting sad lives."
2,"A Study In Narcissism, Not Schizophrenia or Family Relationships","I'm pretty surprised at the amount of good reviews this film has gotten on Amazon--in comparison, the reviews on Netflix are, I think, much more realistic. I think people who have never been exposed to someone like Jonathan Caouette might find this film original and eye-opening, but the fact is that trashy gay male art students from dysfunctional, abusive or drug-addled families are a dime a dozen, and the streets of any major city in America are teeming with them. This film was painful to watch--I was cringing with embarrassment for Jonathan and his family through most of the scenes and found myself watching the film for the train wreck qualities of it, and not because I felt any particular interest in the story of how Jonathan coped with his situation."
1,Bizarre and disturbing,I couldn't watch this video all the way through. It is bizarre and disturbing. Leaves you with an all over bad feeling.
5,Testing and Difficult,"Watching this made me feel like a combination of trusted personal confidante and intrusive stalker, but it is probably one of the best accounts around of living with someone who is traumatised and mentally ill. The story is biographical, and told entirely through photographs and home movies, and is written and narrated by the subject's son. The story is told from his perspective."
5,Excellent,"I enjoyed this book very much, so much that I'm getting all of the books in the series from the first to the last."
1,Ugh.,Started off okay and last chapter was fine but the middle 3/4 of this book is a beating. I would definitely not recommend it to friends and wish I could have those pages back to spend on another book. Waste of my time.
2,Tepid,"This was my first Harold Robbins, and if this is typical of his storytelling, it may very well be my last. Perhaps it was scandalous and ground-breaking at the time it was published, but the book didn't age well. I never did feel anything for the lead character, JeriLee. I didn't sympahtize for her when bad things happened (and there were plenty), and I didn't cheer for her when something good happened. Perhaps because nothing good ever does happen to her. Robbins needed to lighten up a bit. JeriLee needed some shining moments in this morass of melancholy. Or I should say, I as a reader needed some shining moments. This was a heavy, depressing story."
1,Pornography In Book Form!,I'm sad to say that curiosity made me read The Lonely Lady by Harold Robbins and Sorry but I absolutely hated this horrible book and thought it was dumb. This book is a real stinker and it's very trashy and just pornography in book form!
1,"Boring, Pointless, Shallow, Repetitive, and Unlikeable","And those are the points I liked about it!Seriously, though, don't waste your time. The book is extremely dated, offensive, and poorly written, with underdeveloped characterizations and hardly any insight into the motivations of JeriLee or of the sleazebuckets who people her world.I didn't care about any of the characters (except maybe the stepfather, who disappears after the first quarter), and about a third of the way through, I began to be irritated by the protagonist. By the end, I was disgusted by her hypocrisy and bored by her self-centered and superficial ""search"" for herself. The ending was completely moronic.The sex was completely un-erotic in any of its incarnations, the drug use was tedious, and every situation was jam-packed with the same old scenarios throughout.And to think I used to feel guilty about reading Sidney Sheldon novels."
1,Worst book I ever read!,"I read this book long ago, but I always remember it as the worst book I ever read. Somehow it kept me wanting to read what happened next, so I finished it, but after I finished it I felt it had been an infernal waste of time. I swore after that I would never read another book by Harold Robbins and I never have. This book is the quintessential piece of literary trash."
1,not enough information,I have tried to find several meanings for about seven or eight words and found not one of them. This book needs revamped with more words. One word was sanctify; another was extant; and that was just within the past several days. I really do not like this book.
5,Great Find!,This was my mother in law's favorite book as a child; over the years it disappeared. I searched eBay for months then happened upon this gem. Great seller - quick shipment. Product exactly as advertised. Yes - I gave the best prize at Christmas!
5,"""Classic""","I bought this as a gift for my father in law. He grew up with this story and I had never heard of it. It seems people born in the 50s are likely more familiar with this story. I'm sure the moral has something to do with the dangers of envy or showing off. (I could be way off, too.) He was very pleased with his gift, anyway."
2,Not so much for fairytales,"Not so much for stories of ""little black negro's"", that go through trouble, and in the end, magically, things turn alright!Though the stories start well, the English lady telling these stories, has a lousy way of ending them!Not really worth reading, unless you need to fill up 30-40 minutes of your time!"
1,Racist trash,"Actually, this book deserves a negative rating. This book is racist trash.As a white preschool teacher, I would never allow this book anywhere in my classroom. Even if I taught older children, I would still not allow this book in the classroom. It is unmitigated, racist trash. Until children are old enough to be critical readers and thinkers, this book only perpetuates racism. Of course, it is not designed for older children who have these types of skills.For all those people who rate this book highly, they are only showing their inability to understand how harmful early racist stories with their stereotypical illustrations influence young children. Racism is alive and well in the U.S."
1,Condescending Racist Fantasy,"This book is a perfect example of a reigning culture ( in this case Western Caucasian ) dressing up it's post-Slavery Era losses and expanding Colonialism as benevolent towards the ""child-like"" races that only need simple things to be happy in their subordination to the superior white people and their culture.It stunk of racism to me when I was a child in the 1960s. And stinks of racism now. In a post-Civil Rights era, where we should all know better than excuse this smiling little culturally ""unconscience"" evil, there is no excuse for this propaganda."
3,Be ready to wait for this item,"I ordered this item in December, it is now June ... be advised, you'll have to wait more than 1-3 months for this item."
2,Not nice looking,"Maybe I should have read description better but book was pretty cheap looking. The story is obviously the same, pictures are fine. Looks like a little kids book instead of a copy you would be proud to put in your book case."
1,Huge disappointment,Book is so small in size. I would never had thought to check for demensions of book. Very disappointed. I was looking forward to reading to my grandson.
3,Old Favorite,"I enjoyed this folktale as a child and was glad to find it on Amazon. While I am glad to have the storybook, I wasn't impressed with the illustrations. To be fair, I was probably expecting illustrations similar to the ones in book I read at Grandma's, still these illustrations make the characters more stark. Its a good find, and worth having, but I wish the illustrations were more appealing."
3,Glad I found a copy of the book,This book was purchased as a gift. I was so disappointed the pictures of the book were not in color. The copy of the book I own is in color. I did not have time to exchange it for one that was illustrated in color. It would have been helpful to acknowledge this in the description of the book.The book was delivered in a timely matter.
3,Got this for a friend for a gift for her mother-in-law,"Got this for a friend for a gift for her mother-in-law. I enjoyed the story as a child though. (I'm old, ok.)"
3,Book,I grew up knowing this book. And now I can enjoy reading it with my children as well. Good read.
2,THIS BOOK IS TOO SMALL,"This book is TOO small, only about 4*5. The pictures of the tigers running around the tree is so small and some pages don't have any pictures at all. There was no size listed on the book profile. Very disappointed since these were ordered for my mother to give to her grandkids at Christmas and it's too late to return them & get something else."
3,Read this book first in the 50's and was quite entertaining.,"I found this book exciting and as a child I didn't know of racism and never thought of this book as anything but a childs story. Wasn't this story started in India? I have a copy from around 1930, there is no publishing date, and I would like to hear from some one who knows about this particular book. I also believe this story book was published in England before it was published here."
1,Insulting racist tripe,"This is racist trash and I find myself alternately appalled and amused by the bizarrely arrogant defense of such insulting tripe, brimming with racial slander. These sentiments are quite revealing, I hope you are proud of yourselves."
1,Hard to believe kids would like this book.,"I was read this book as a 4 year-old in 1972 by my teacher, and didn't like it. I found the writing style very old-fashioned. Neither the pictures nor story appealed to me, (and I felt sorry for the tigers). Most of us kids back then had never seen a black person before in that part of England, so I don't think the caricatures gave a good impression. Nowadays, of course I would be totally horrfied if anyone actually sold a book with this title."
1,Why only 1 star?... because you cannot leave ZERO STARS,"I'm so glad we have a fresh new tale of racial ridicule and slander to look forward to: I don't think our children's minds were being warped enough by the old one. This is racist trash and I find myself alternately appalled and amused by the bizarrely arrogant defense of such insulting tripe, brimming with racial slander. These sentiments are quite revealing."
5,FAVORITE CHILDHOOD STORY,THIS WAS A FAVORITE CHILDHOOD STORY WHEN I WAS A CHILD. THIS STORY WAS IN A BOOK OF CHILDREN STORIES THAT MY OLDER SISTER HAD.THE BOOK WAS STOLEN AND NOW THAT I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN OF MY OWN I HAVE LONG SEARCHED FOR THIS BOOK. THANKS FOR HAVING IT. IT BRINGS BACK FOND CHILDHOOD MEMORIES.
1,no illustrations downloaded; ...SO I bought another illustrated version,"I expected this to have at least one illustration... it did not.So, I ordered the one with ILLUSTRATED in the larger discription.... this infers that it does have some illustrations.I wanted the older version to bring back memories of the story I loved in the '40s.The book went out of print; I'm delighted to have the it back."
1,Disappointed,"The actual book is very small (5""x4"") which makes it hard to see the pictures clearly which appear muddied. If I had known the book was this small I would not have purchased it because it is not conducive for reading to a child, difficult to hold and look at at the same time."
4,little black sambo,"check book dimensions. I was surprised at the size. My mother read this book as a child and has always wanted a copy. I knew of the controversy but had never seen the book myself. After buying it I was eager to see what the fuss was about. I don't get! Apparently it is the pictures which were not done buy a professional(in 1899). As for the name sambo, it was turned into a slur by some bigot and probably would have happened with any name chosen. I'm sure many will be offended when I say ""get over it"" you brought more attention to this ""offense"" than it ever would have gotten otherwise. EVERYONE has had an unflattering portrayal at sometime. Let it go. I thought it was a cute story."
5,LET'S NEVER LOSE THE CLASSICS,"The story of little black Sambo is truly a classic from all who remember it from our childhood.Helen Bannerman wrote this story for her two little children while traveling with them by train across India. If people would LOOK AT THE ILLUSTRATIONS they would see that Sambo is a little Indian boy from India, continents away from America and the Cival war and or South. I ran 2 independant bookstores some 12 to 14 years ago and when I finally found THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO in print again I'd order maybe 60 copies a week and could not keep this wonderful little storybook in stock. Almost every buyer were grandparents who could not wait to introduce their grandchildren to a book we all knew and loved. It is a must have for all collectors of wonderful literature!"
3,good,The book is good but it didn't say the pictures were in black and white and that is an important part of the book.
3,Bought this because I never read it when I was growing up.,Have not yet opened this..but will read from cover to cover when I get time. I am too old to make it a primary task.
1,How lovely: An anthology of racial slander,"This is racist trash and I find myself alternately appalled and amused by the bizarrely arrogant defense of such insulting tripe, brimming with racial slander. These sentiments are quite revealing."
1,The Story of Little Jew Josh,"HarperCollins would never publish this little gem if it was titled The Story of Little Jew Josh regardless of how cute and innocent the characters,illustrations, story were. It wouldnt matter if some English lady had written in India or Israel. Just my two cents and Happy reading to all!"
2,Would not purchase again.,"Bought this for our anniversary. Leather is the third year traditional wedding anniversary gift. Loved the picture online. Ours came with many things wrong with it. Was not happy. Also they call it wall art, but there is no way to hang it. It had dents and burn marks in the leather. Would not buy this again."
3,Donald Miller,"Miller doesn't ever disappoint those that love his writing. It's open and honest and raw and rambling at times. But, it's him. And if you love him, you'll probably love this!"
2,Its ok,"Not as easy a read as the other Donald Miller books (blue like jazz, father fiction, searching for God knows what, etc) I didn't finish it. Maybe I will revisit it. I think it was just a little slow-going for me. I don't know, have a read and decide for yourself."
2,Disappointment after BLJ,"This books pales in comparison to his ""Blue Like Jazz"". While a cross country road trip is a great premise for a book- this one just falls flat. The conversations seem wooden and not terribly realistic for two 'dudes' traveling together. The 3rd character, their ancient VW van which breaks down at frequent intervals, should have been given a name to add some texture and imagination at least.I think the fact that they had to travel mostly on interstates and had very little time to actually linger in the towns and backwaters they encountered meant that at best you have a few meaningful encounters but largely time is spent just trying to cover mileage fast and cheap.Average read and I've already put it in the 'goodwill' box."
4,"Great for young people, especially guys","I bought this audio CD because I love Donald Miller's ""Blue Like Jazz"" and think he's got some profound things to say. It's so centered on a young man's quest/non-quest/quest to find out whether there's anything to quest for that it didn't speak to this 40ish woman the way his other books have. However, I still got something out of it and recommend it highly. I think it would speak loudest to kids in their late teens. Good stuff."
2,Really disappointed...,"I'm normally quite a fan of Donald Miller, but I found Through Painted Deserts, as another reader put it, too self-conscious. While he has some occasional pithy comments (I've been haunted by the ""how"" vs. ""why"" question since I finished the book), he sacrifices the actual narrative for his own ramblings. As a caveat, though, I've read the original Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance (which this book was an editing of), and found it to be much more spiritually honest and narratively raw. There's more Jesus in it, I thought, which is unfortunately the point that Through Painted Deserts kind of misses."
5,Excellent road trip tale,"Most people dream of a road trip; few actually take one. Donald and Paul did and the tale is worth reading. We all need to be reminded of how little we really need to survive beyond the desire for adventure, the will to pursue it, and faith in God's goodness to carry us through."
1,VERY disappointed,"I was quite disappointed in this book. I forced myself read to page 100 or so, and then I had to abandon this book. The author came across as arrogant as he kept telling the reader about all the supposedly ""funny"" things he did and said. For example, while at the Grand Canyon the park service agent asks for his registration, so he gives her his blockbuster card, then some other membership card--and he's telling this story because he apparently thinks that this is funny or clever, while it is just annoying. What I could get through all seemed rambling, boring, and pointless."
2,"Fans of Blue Like Jazz, Avoid","I loved Blue Like Jazz, and liked Searching for God Knows What a lot, but this left me very cold. The sort of feigned modern-day Kerouac thing just comes off as pretentious &, worse, dull. Neither Miller nor his travelling companion are very compelling characters. Their adventures are not all that interesting. The insights sprinkled through the narrative are few & far between, and really not all that insightful. It was if he wanted to merge a Bill Bryson travellogue with Blue Like Jazz - but forgot the humor found in both. Instead, we get a couple of really fairly dull guys limping along the American West in a beat up VW van. Miller is witty enough that I can't quite give him only one star, though probably should. Call it 1.5 stars. Not good."
3,alright.,if you read blue like jazz and were expecting some biblical revelations from this book you wont get it. as far as an entertaining story it's fine.
4,Smooth Read,"Don Miller can really write. I'm convinced that his conversational and beautifully descriptive style could make any topic interesting; however, the story was interesting enough. It takes us along the author's journey across the U.S.A. with his friend Paul. They have some cool adventures, some detours, and some great conversations about love, GOD, and the mystery of this series of events we call life. I read it in a matter of days because the humor and smooth narrative style make it a quick and easy read. I appreciate Miller's insights on the metaphor that GOD intended nature to be. I think the road trip was taken when he was very young and you can tell in his conversations and philosophical narration (it can be a bit immature at times) but its still some great food for thought in there.In three words, the book is: Hilarious, Inspirational, and Thought Provoking. Well, four words technically."
5,Miller continues to please,"I first read ""Blue Like Jazz"", before ""Through Painted Deserts"", so I got Don's history a little out of sync. Normally I'm not a huge nonfiction fan, but I love the flowing style that Don Miller writes in. Plus he likes the same kind of experiences that I do. I have definitely become a fan.The big criticism of Don by Christian theologians is that he is either ""off"" on this theology or too postmodern in his theology. I think it's telling that God didn't write a theology textbook, but a series of nonfiction stories that tell a Story--the story of redemption. I see that Don understands this, and wants to tell his part in the epic. And he's gifted at doing just that.Many more of us would benefit if we had Don's authentic relationship with God."
1,"Good, but scattered thoughts","I appreciated the conclusions drawn by Don and Paul, but got tired listening to the long, overly descriptive narratives about the Volkswagen van. The book seemed a bit scattered and I kept thinking to myself, just get to the point. It would probably be a good read, but the narrator was boring to listen to. There was only just enough adventure to keep my attention to the end."
3,Healthy chunks of Wagner...,"This near 80min. budget/German compilation, comprises of most of Meastro Stokowski's RCA/BMG stereo recorded Wagner output, from 1961-1974. The 2003 German remastering engineers do not add any significant sound enhancement to what were considered state of the art recordings from their era. Furthermore some of the tracks are either coarse or too heavy in the bass, requiring treble bass adjustments. Stokowski's great interpretation of ""Ride of the Valkyries"", with sopranos and contralto performers is included. My old LP of the same recording was just as thrilling. Included are orchestral excerpts from each of the ""Ring"" operas, as well as the Romanesque overture to ""Rienzi"". The disc is poorly annotated not even mentioning Stokowski's idiosyncrasies of interpretation, instrumentation, and tempo. So, the whole project has a half-hearted faceless effort put on it. Add a star if your a true die-hard Stokowski fan."
3,the gold overlay is just a little to bright,the ring is pretty but just a little to flashy for me the band is not made for small hands
5,Funny no matter who you are,"You know what I love most about this comic strip? There's something for everyone. Yes the story starts off with a single mom living with her two daughters, her mom, her sister and her son so it is a lot of females in the beginning...but males appear along the way. And they don't push she the original cast out of the way, instead they compliment it, adding even more depth to the family than there was in the beginning. The stories are down to earth, without being overly sentimental or sappy (like some other comics that I won't name) and you can easily relate to the characters and recognize your own events in your life. It's a genuinely funny strip that I look forward to reading each day.And yep Amazon isn't selling new copies, but you can check here: [...] and pick up a signed copy of the book!"
5,Beautiful Switches,I put these in my newly remodeled Kitchen and Bath. I love them! I had paint made to match and bought switch plate covers and painted them. I used a $2.95 sample of paint and it worked great.
5,Chinese Jump Rope,I purchased 3 ropes as I have three girl scout patrols in our troop. We needed to learn to use them as part of our badge work. The directions provided games for us to use and the drawstring bags help us to keep them within reach since we play them a great deal. The girls LOVE them!
5,Kirkwood Ranch on the Snake,"Sould be required reading for women comtemplating a 'simple lifestyle'. Combines a picture of the work and the wonder of living on the Snake River in 1933 with 3 small children, isolated from almost everything and everyone. What a wealth of experience graced the life of Grace Jordan at a cost of work and worry that would put most of us modern women to shame. She was the real deal! Visiting the Jordan ranch after reading this book was the icing on the cake! Oh, you can google earth the ranch if visiting it is not an option."
2,Disappointed in quality,"It is difficult to get the net to stay taught, it keeps sagging in the middle. We keep tightening the rope ties to the poles. There should be some kind of quick release mechanism to untie one side of the net from the pole for when you don't want the net up. The pole bases are not very sturdy even though they are completely filled with water. The kids were playing with the brand new racquets for less than five minutes when the tape on the handle of two of them unraveled and fell off and on the third racquet, the wood handle actually broke in half. The racquets don't appear to be made for use in the water (which is ridiculous) I plan to complain to the manufacturer to get replacement racquets."
3,Huge!,"Pros: Fantastic fabric and quality constructionCons: Limited colors, Size disproportionately largeWe bought this for our 7 month old (who was large for his age). He absolutely swam in the bag, and we opted not to use it as the largeness of it made it less snuggly. It was like laying him in the middle of a twin bed duvet folded in half the long way - he was absolutely lost in it. I would recommend going for the smaller size. Now at one year old it would probably fit him this winter (it's about 4"" longer than him), but as he can now stand I don't think he would be willing to be stuck in a bag. It's a pity we didn't buy the smaller one - but this arrived the day before we left America and we had no time to return it."
3,Not so bright,"It is a really cool light and will do exactly what I am looking for but its not very bright, not very bright at all. Certainly not super bright."
1,"AVOID,AVOID,AVOID","i like sway and tech,both are dope,but do not waste your cash on this garbage,ive got all there stuff from the wake up show,and it all roks,so i dont know what happened here,but it wasnt good,so get 1of there albums from the wake up show freestyles,any 1 of the 8 will do,they are all bangers,they should have zero in the rating bar above,so then this can get its correct rating,once again DONT WASTE YOUR CASH"
2,A little pricey for a basic options introduction.,"I'm not sure that this type of brief introduction should cost more than about $20. It was simply a taped seminar and very simple concepts that, in my opinion, could have been handled in a 10 page pamphlet.The Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) website has free computer-aided training that is probably more useful (http://www.cboe.com/LearnCenter/default.aspx). Again, that is my personal opinion based upon having spent several months now looking for information and training on options.On the positive side, I enjoyed the instructor. He seemed very knowledgeable and I would recommend future DVD courses from him and others if they were in the less than $20 range. I also purchased ""High Impact Options Trading"" from the same producers and will review it separately but my opinion is about the same for it."
4,"Easy to understand, yet fairly thorough","I was taught intermediate micro using this book. For that class, I found this book helpful and easy to follow. I still use it as a reference for simple concepts that I've forgotten."
4,Great!,"I received exactly what i paid for and at a great cheap price. The book was in good condition also, it is a bit highlighted inside but that doesn't bother me."
4,Great,"The book was exactly as described. I believe it was my bad to not completely comprehend that it was in a binder instead of an actual book. That's okay though. Other than that, it's great."
1,a high school textbook,This is a horrible textbook and I mean it. The only possible use I can think of is to use it as a high school textbook.
5,My favorite episode,"First off, I am 1 of the few male Sailor Moon fans, but I can't help loving the show. ""Enemies No More"" is my favorite episode EVER! Catsy is my favorite bad guy of all SM. I like ""Naughty N' Nice"". It had a pretty good amount of action. ""Prediction of Doom"" was okay, not the best episode ever. I already told you about ""Enemies No More"", and ""Checkmate"" was also very good. This tape is great! Any SM fan will love it."
4,THIS video is a MUST SEE for ALL SM fans!,"Well, all of the episodes on the tape are great, but my top favorite is ""Prediction of Doom"". In That episode, Serena is still getting over the fact Darien dumped her, so she pigs out on junk food. Then, when a monster comes, and she turns into Sailor Moon, she gets, well, you have to see it to find out!Another good one, though I can't remember the title is the one where Prince Diamond kidnaps Serena and dresses her up to look like Queen Serenity. She can't transform, so how does she escape? BUY THE MOVIE AND FIND OUT!"
5,"perfect, as always","one more delicious c.d. from a master . if you like his work, you'll love this one too"
4,great dub piece,"getting heavily into dub,I recenyly picked up this album which is truly rie.This is classic dub from the mid-eighties.Only its length keeps it from being a 5 star CD"
2,"Not bad, but could be better:","Isn't a handbook supposed to have more samples and exercises? I wish this book would be a guide to practical hand-on experience more than an accumulation of short explanation that I could have gotten a better one in other books of references. Nonetheless, the book isn't bad for a beginner, who could use this book first, and then venture into more advanced books."
3,Good book about NetWare 5.,This book is generaly written in a good way and easy to understand. But there are some chapters I wish them to be more detailed.
2,ehhh,"Really didn't work for me, by the end of the day I was pretty smelly and thats just sitting at a desk typing all day. And I do NOT have a problem with odor control. I think this is the first time I have ever put on deodorant and in less than 24 hours started to smell like BO.The scent to me is pretty mild, not like vicks, not like anything much really. But I can tell you what smelt strong, my pits after a day with this deodorant. Ewww.If the trade off is to be all natural and stinky, or full of chemicals and smell great I take smelling great.Too bad I bought two sticks at once :(."
3,DID NOT SMELL-DID NOT WORK,"I bought this deodorant expecting lax coverage but a great smell. The deodorant melts directly into the 'pit'. I had to run my hand over it to reassure myself I even had any on. The smell is a bit mediciny when you smell the stick- a bit like melding vicks with a rose honey scent. I thought maybe if I exercised I would knock some of the scent into existene.Nope, nada, none, and to make it worse my pits were dripping.Good only if you are seriously allergic to other deodorants-but I'm sure their are better ones out there even if you are."
4,Locking up savings,I've installed at least 20 of these locking brake levers in the past two years and never had a complaint or an issue. They are dependable and easy to install and adjust. Good stuff.
4,Don't Eliminate This One,"ZZ Top's sudden MTV omnipresence and massive popularity that followed the 1983 release of ""Eliminator"" may have jarred long time fans of the little ol' band from Texas, but the truth is that the album is also one of their best. The hits may have been inescapble on video and the radio at the time, but ""Gimmie All Your Lovin',"" ""Sharp Dressed Man"" and ""Legs"" are perfect pop rock gems that still hold up two decades later. Other standout cuts are the harder rocking ""Got Me Under Pressure,"" another MTV goof ""TV Dinners,"" and one of their better slower songs in ""I Need You Tonight."" The rest is certainly filler material, but holds up well enough.Overall, a huge commercial and artistic success that marked the high point of the Top's long career."
4,Its good but damn that MTV!,"Eleminator, wow what a great album, the last good ZZ Top album for like 10 years though! You know who I blame for that, MTV, they killed so many good bands and made so many killer rock bands go soft! This could have been a five star album had it not been so MTV. But they must have done something right because I think this was their biggest selling album ever.All the hits off this album 'Gimme All Your Lovin' 'Got Me Under Pressure' 'Sharp Dressed Man' and 'Legs' are all killer songs but there are other good songs on the album as well. Of all the songs that are not hits 'TV Dinners' is my favorite. 'I Need You Tonight' is a sweet little ballady type sympathtic song with some killer guitar.This is a killer rock album that could have been better had it not been so synthed out and poppy, but over all this is one of ZZ Top's best albums."
5,this cd rocks,This the pnmly ZZ Top cd that I like is one of the best ones and music that you can play old night. And don't forget the songs that was in Miami Vice that came from this cd.
5,Best ZZ Top Album ever!!!,"I've been a fan for at least 25 years. This is a great album. Much better than Afterburner. In my opinion ""Need You Tonight"" is probably the best ZZ song of all time. You won't go wrong with this one. Good from start to finish. More polish than the early records but less commercial than some that followed. Pure ZZ Top at its best."
5,Great ZZ Top,This has to be one of the best ZZ Top albums of all times. It is good hard driving rock all through with those three Texas dudes that never fail to impress.
1,Order not filled,I ordered this item on 3/14/2009 as of this date (4/14/2009) I have not received my order and have had no communication from the seller (Legacy). To say that I am dissatisfied is an understatement. I am in the process of trying to obtain a refund from Amazon.
2,Bizarre,"I saw this guy interviewed on Letterman last night, and let me just tell you ... WEIRD!!!!! He's a former country artist and actor who now thinks he can play guitar and jam in a rock band. I've got one thing to say to that -- NOT!!!!!Cryptic one-word answers and dark sunglasses will only get you so far in this non-MTV generation. After all, it ain't the 1980s anymore. To be a real artist you need substance, which this dude is lacking.On the positive side, his first movie was pretty neat!!For real country music, visit the Henry the Hermit website at [...].See ya soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A 1970s band figures out how to be a 1980s band,"The 1980s were not kind to musicians who made their mark in the 1970s. Many (too many) attempted to incorporate 1980s production into their sound. Results were mixed, and even the successful attempts sound dated today. Then along comes a little ol' band from Texas that shows how it's done. ZZ Top not only incorporates synths and drum machines into their gritty Texas blues sound, they blow the lid right off and have the greatest success of their career! Prior to Eliminator, the band did experiment with synths in some songs, but so did a lot of bands in the eighties. But Eliminator is a full-blown 1980s production laid over a gritty three piece blues band and unbelievably it actually works. Not only that, but you can listen to Eliminator today and it doesn't sound dated. This really is a brilliant work of genius, and IMHO it's not even the Top's best album song-wise."
5,Classic ZZ Top!!!,"This is a great ZZ Top album(CD these days)!!! Contains the hits:Sharp Dressed Man,Legs,and Gimmie All Your Lovin'!!! The other tracks are great too!!! A classic album(CD)!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
4,"Not perfect, but good.","This may have come out during the early days of MTV, but it is still a good c.d.. My only complaint is that my copy has the version of ""Legs "" from the 1992 Greatest Hits Collection. It still a good version, but it is not the original. Billy Gibbons must have been experimenting with Rockman guitar gear instead of the same stuff he used for Eliminator. Maybe someone at Aol/ Time Warrner goofed up the remastering and misplaced the master recordings. All of the other songs are the original versions. Billy Gibbons guitar tone cooks throughoutthe whole album. He playing is awsome. ""Need you tonight""is veryunderrated"
4,Good to add to your collection.,"This is a good ZZ Top album with songs like ""Gimme All Your Lovin"", ""Sharp Dressed Man"", and ""Legs"". The bearded Texans continue their legacy of their unique bluesy rock and this album should be added to every fan collection."
3,Best ZZ Top Album in the Sequence era,"I have to differ from these other reviewers. This is a good Top disc, but does not touch Tres Hombres, unless you like playing to a sequencer. Hardcore Top fans will agree that the true ZZ Top sound (Texas Sound) of rock and blues comes from the Tres Hombres and Fandango era. Come on. Even Rhythmeen tops this one, but then again MTV viewers probably like this better because it's so commercial. Give me ""Sure got cold after the rain fell"" any day to ""Gimme all your lovin"" or ""Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers"" to ""Legs"". No comparison, but good to have in your collection. And Hello, Frank Beard is the Drummer Guys. Saw them many times , but when they played Curtis Hixon Hall(no longer) in Tampa, I became their biggest fan. Wish they would get back to their roots and not be the sell out they were in the 80's."
1,"Wow, Pullman!?","I'm sure Milton would be furious if he read the intro. to this book. It's classic how Pullman pulls Paradise Lost into portraying his own view points of the world. I should have guessed. Don't buy it, Pullman has apparently no idea of Milton's history, and has misread the book."
1,CD Doesn't work,"This is a cheap, single MP3 CD that doesn't play in any CD player I have tried to use it with. The case cover is slightly different from the one pictured. The actual cover has the same artwork, but clearly indicates that a single MP3 CD is enclosed. The Amazon page seems to have deleted any reference to how many CDs are included, and what format is used. In this way the advertisement is misleading."
2,Paradise Lost,"Pullman has no understanding of Milton, actually he can do nothing but project his views on to Milton and Paridise Lost. This does neither he or Milton any good. I think if you want to read Milton then one should read Milton, I really think that after all these years he can stand on his own. But if you are impressed by the cover and the looks of a book, then this shallow self adualtion will do."
5,"A superb, user-friedly edition","Paradise Lost is my favorite work in the English language, and this is my favorite edition of it (I have quite a few). The editor, Roy Flannagan, does a superb job with the footnotes. They address just about every question a modern reader might have, provide plenty of historical context and explain in detail the zillions of references and names that someone who is not intimately familiar with all of Milton's sources (among them the Bible and ancient Greek and Roman mythology) will have a hard time understanding. Flannagan's infectious enthusiasm for this poem comes across loud and clear, and he never condescends to readers that lack a PhD, like Merritt Hughes does in his scholarly edition of Paradise Lost. Finally, the page layout of the Flannagan edition makes reading and note taking real easy. In sum, this is hands down the best edition of Paradise Lost."
5,Beautiful edition,"Interesting but skimpy comments from Philip Pullman, but the real attractions are a very clean and historically sensitive page design and the Michael Burghers engravings from the first illustrated edition of 1688. I own other PL's, but from now on this is the one I will take down to read."
5,Brilliant,"First of all, this book is not easy to read but it IS worth the time and effort. Because it is actually a poem written as a book, there is difficulty reading it. Also, the language of Milton's time is quite different from our modern-day language. But if you can overcome these problems, you will find a brilliantly written poem/story that will keep you mesmerized especially if you know the general background of the story."
1,Not much here,"I was hoping for an edition of the poem that would help wade through the arcane verbiage and perspective of a 350-year-old mind. I was hoping for an introduction, glossary, and notes to help with the task. This book has none of that, only the bare text of the poem. Other reviews said that it had good notes. There must be some confusion of editions because this one has nothing. The only reason I did not return it was because it was not expensive and therefore not worth my time to send it back."
3,Only contains Book 1 of Paradise lost,I received the book in the mail and noticed how small the book seemed to be and then I realized it is only book 1 of Paradise Lost and therefore not very useful for my college class.
5,Worth the effort,"Years ago, I first read this work when I was completing my master's courses in literature. I worked diligently and ploddingly to move through the abyss of confusion. With the help of Cliff Notes and of making careful notations in my book, it began to come together after the first fifty pages or so. (It was rather like learning to read middle English or Shakespeare.) Then, Milton's Paradise opened and I fell in. I stood in the Garden as the Snake tempted Adam and Eve. Never was there a more tantalizing personification of Evil. Yes, he was appealing. When Adam stood with God upon the mountain and looked at the fate of Mankind, it's decline and the fall, you, too, feel the intense pain and shame of Adam. Milton creates, in his vision, a recreation of an ancient story with an extraordinary slant."
3,Be Wary About the Cover,"I'd just like to point out that, despite being allowed to select which 'format' of the book I want to purchase - which allows me to purchase an edition with an appealing cover - I did -NOT- receive the edition I selected. I fail to see the point of allowing customers to select from different book editions if you aren't going to be sending the edition that is advertised. I am extremely disappointed with the edition I received, but I will not be returning it. Just a heads up."
5,MILTON'S EPIC WORK,"At last John Milton, one of the foremost epic poets in the English language, has been rescued from the oblivion of academic cloisters and set free for what might be an entirely new group of readers. When I re-read Paradise Lost, I realized how many of its themes and even its lines, have been used as grist for the mills of others that have followed over the centuries since it was penned. If you've only read this great work in college, it's time to read it again."
3,entertaining,"The book was entertaining and hard to put down. It is hard to get me to say that about a book, but this one had enough elements of difference about it to make it addictive."
3,nice book,i'm glad they have these books online so that i can buy these for free to read these books anytime i want to. nice for people who are forced to read these books.
4,Paradise Lost unlike any other epic.,"Paradise Lost I think, is one of the best epics written around 1667. The language and Milton's own belief of Christanity is one of the main reasons this unique epic was so popular during his time, and why it has remained one of the worlds greatest epics still today. Unlike other epics written at the time, Milton tries to stay away from war as being his central subject. Instead, he writes of more nobler topics. The whole idea that the entire universe is guided by God's providenc, is captured in this epic unlike any other."
2,A misreading.,"By making the embodiment of evil heroic Paradise Lost undermines our concept of the heroic. The poem does not represent evil as heroic. It represents the traditional virtues of the heroic as evil. Pullman has misread this completely and has framed the poem within this misreading.... ""better to reign in hell than serve in heaven"" is a fine line, noble, staunch, heroic, but it is also a lie as to the minions who hear it it collapses into ""better to serve in hell than serve in heaven,"" which is facile.Pullman's trilogy is very well written, but is, in part, a fleshed out misreading of Paradise Lost. That is fine, and I enjoyed reading it. But it is irritating when Pullman presents Milton as some kind of ally in this misreading, which Pullman does with this edition of Paradise Lost, and which Milton is not."
4,A cosmic battle,"I used the Norton critical edition edited by Scott ElledgeWe will discover in these pages a profound rendering of the cosmic battle between good and evil, man's fall through disobedience to God, and Satan's perversion on mankind.Each line serves a purpose, so in order to inhale this sublime poem to its fullest it will be necessary to slow down. Immensely valuable to understanding this difficult poem is the editor's explanatory summery going into each of the twelve books (chapters) and the numerous footnotes.The second half of the book contains a biography, an historical evolution, other writings, and a critical analysis of Milton by multiple revered authors with a wide degree of beliefs.Wish you wellScott"
5,Timeless classic,It helps clarify the fall of man and the devil's role. It is hard to plow through the language but worth the effort.
4,"Read it for a class, but I would read it again for fun","Milton's work is full of beautiful language and very memorable quotes. Even as a devout Christian, his views on the nature of man, woman, God and particularly Satan are fascinating and refreshing. The classic tale of Adam and Eve is given more life and beauty than I would have ever guessed. One of my favorite quotes from the work:""The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven. What matter where, if I be still the same?"" (Satan, Book 1)"
2,Cheap but you get what you pay for.,My Kindle version lacks an introduction and any footnotes or endnotes. When it comes to the clasics I guess it is better not to use Kindle until they work out all the issues. This is the second book I've had a problem with. I tried a sample of Boswell's Life of Johnson and it was unreadable. Milton is worth reading just not in this format.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I knew this was going to only have an excerpt from the Demonologist book, but I wish there was more in there. The actual poem could have just been downloaded."
5,"A Daring, Outstanding piece of Liturature","Paradise Lost is John Milton's epic poem about the fall of Lucifer and Adam and Eve's banishment from the Garden of Eden. The audacity of Milton opening the poem with declareing that he's going to pursue things unattempted in prose or rhyme and to justify the ways of God to men is enough to get people reading to ifinity. The succsesfull attempt to tell the orgin of Hell and the story of Adam and Eve outside of the bible is a daring mission Milton puts himself through but comes out joyusly triumphant. This poem is such a significant moment in literature that it has become mentioned in various History Channel documentaries and has been put in many prestige formats.If you see this book on this website, BUY IT IMEDEATLY!"
2,Paradise Lost-Couldn't get into it....,"This is a highly recommended book by practically everyone who has read it. My opinion is that this is for a person who is into high-caliber poetry.I am an avid reader, but for some reason, I was unable to get into this book--at all. I had to re-read sections multiple times to understand the meaning, and it was exhausting to refer to the multiple footnotes on every page. Perhaps this isn't my ideal genre.I will say that those who created this book did their homework, and made a great attempt to help the reader understand its content. You read a bit about the biography of the author in the beginning, and understand where he comes from in life.I know this is an absolute classic book, but for me, I strugggled a bit while reading it."
4,A Classic,"Penguin Classic Editions of any book are truly great. One should also note that Signet Classics is also Penguin but this version should only be brought if Penguin Classics is not available. Of course, one has to evaluate one's purpose for the book but Penguin always has notes and good Intros for their books.I purchased this book for a paper in which I had to choose a chapter and write about it. This version is really clear but is written as Milton would have written it so some of the old English is difficult but there are notes and major parts. The only problem I have with this edition is that there are no chapter titles so you really do not know what each chapter is about unless you read it."
4,All The Goddamn Lyrical Gloom Of Catholicism At Fever Pitch!,This stunning epic poem of the fall of both Lucifer & man from God's good grace is full of all the self-indulgent goth agony to fuel a lifetime of bitter recrimination and despair. Woe is everybody!
2,Hard to Read,"This version suffers from the major, all to common flaw, of many translated works.Literal translations and attempts at keeping rhythm in another language can often make great works difficult to follow smoothly or even comprehend.I read classics for entertainment and inspiration. Being forced to reread sections due to poor translation kills both."
1,Kindle edition improperly typeset,"The Kindle edition is improperly typeset, right justified with an overly wide left margin. Even at font size 3 this forces improper and unnecessary linebreaks as early as line 8. It makes font size 4 unusable, though there's plenty of room."
1,Mistaken,A mistake on my part. I can‘t write a review of a book that i simply can not get interested in. sorry
2,very boreing,I did get the general idea of the book (or poem) but it was very confusing the way it was written. I read about 25 percent of the book then I gave up. There were words in the book that were not even words according to the dictionary so I didn't know what their meaning was in relationship to the story(poem). I talked to my daughter-in-law who is a English Literature teacher at a college in Colorado; she said she had to read Paradise Lost while she was working on her college degree and if there was any way she would have been able to get out of reading it she would have but since it was part of her class she had to read it.If anyone has the patience to sit through this sort of writing this is for you.
3,Not William Blake,"The sample pictures for this items are actually engravings by Gustave Dore, not by William Blake as this item states."
4,good e-reader edition; no support material,"If you want to know what ""classical education"" means then read this poem. The writing is littered (in a good way) with references to many major (and some minor) classic Western Europenan people and ideas. If nothing else this book will challenge your memory as it unfolds the origins of modern literature in terms of creating an original universe inside a story that we thought we knew.At times Milton's story is hard to follow but at other times, once you find the rhythm, like all good poetry, his words shift you into a deeper consciousness.This e-edition does not come with notes, a glossary or any other supplimental material. The formatting is good. The text is filled with Milton's spelling variations (most of the time the modern word equivalent is obvious).4 stars for this e-edition. 5 stars for the writing; with the understanding that original work like this is too subjective to truely be defined in terms of stars."
5,"For the student of Milton, one cannot do better than this","Not only does this book contain the revised Paradise Lost, but excerpts from other Milton works, like the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, Christian Doctrine, Areopagetica, and others. Everything one needs to understand Milton's theological beliefs on the creation, the fall, and the institution of marriage can be found in this book!!!"
3,Kindle e-book is a mediocre reading experience,"This review focuses on the Kindle reading experience of this e-book, rather than on the literary merits of Milton's epic poem.The Kindle experience is fairly mediocre.The book is out of copyright and has been roughly scanned. The poor (non-existent?) post-scan editing of the e-book means it has plenty of typographical and formatting errors.There is little point in offering very cheap classics if the quality is poor - as it is with every one of the cheap classics I have bought from Amazon (see all my reviews).The poem is full of classical and biblical allusions. Some can be looked up in the kindle dictionary with one click, but most cannot. It would be a great help if the kindle came with an encyclopedia as well as a dictionary. Wikipedia is no substitute."
2,For Erudite Poets,A Christian classiic which I had difficulty following. We are not a poetiical generation.Deeply symbolic with terms & allusions more suited to Milton's times.
2,Poetic,"Too poetic for my likes. Too poetic for my likes., Too poetic for my likes, too poetic for my likes."
1,Couldn't even get past first page,"Not my cup of tea at all. I couldn't even get through the first page and have removed this from my Kindle as I considered it a waste of space. I tried skimming some of the ""books"" but just gave up after about 15 minutes. Definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know !!!"
1,Rip-off copy,"Love the text of paradise lost, but this listing sells you a book about the size of your laptop computer. The cover is is formatted wrong, and the inside has no line numbers, so if you're reading it with a class or want to look up a line or something, no can do. DON'T get it from this listing unless you really can't afford a real copy of the book!"
3,Classic Required Reading,"Was supposed to have read it in High School...Read the Cliff Notes instead! Trying to catch up.It's O.K., for a Classic!"
4,Classic revisited,Paradise Lost is a classic novel that I believe everyone should read at some point in their lives. This edition with the added portion is great for a younger generation.
4,Nice edition; Norton is wonderful,"I bought this edition to supplement the Teskey edition. I found the essays in both to be wonderful additions, but the footnotes in this one were far superior. I do have one gripe with both editions: there are no intext footnotes. The footnotes are at the bottom of each page, but there is no indication within the text that there is a footnote to go with the particular passage/line/word you are reading. I believe I have been spoiled by the other Norton Critical Editions of British Literature, English Literature, and Shakespeare."
5,Love these shoes,This is the third pair of this model I've owned and I have been thrilled with every single one. Great running shoe or just an everyday shoe.
3,Ok early MacDonald,"Being a big fan of Ross MacDonald, I know that his early books (pre-1958) are solid but rather standard hard-boiled mysteries very much in the Hammett/Chandler school. MacDonald didn't really find his voice (and his power as a writer) until his amazing streak of successes that started with 1959's The Galton Case, and beyond.Having known that when I started The Way Some People Die (written 1951), I was still surprised to find it pedestrian and somewhat less than gripping. The plot is appropriately complex, but of all MacDonald's books this definitely comes across as undistinguished and derivative of Chandler in particular. The comings and goings of several characters (especially the daughter who Archer is hired to find at the beginning) make little sense, and the environment of gangsters, thugs and hired goons is not what MacDonald does best, and they're the kind of Hollywood stock characters that make this book feel tired and dated in a way that no other MacDonald books are."
4,the way some people die,this book is very satisfying. the carecters are well fleshed out and lew archer is at his hard boilest. mcdonald has done it again.
4,"Great quality, but some errors","As a Spanish tutor, I have to say that this book's best feature is its Listening Comprehension CD. I have used this book to help prepare students of all levels to better understand the Spanish language. The listening comprehension guides are perfect for anyone--from an advanced student to a beginner.. In addition, the practice tests are amazing for their quantity, not necessarily their quality. The downside to this book is that there are several typos and errors that a novice student wouldn't catch. Overall, it is a good book to use, but use it with the supervision of a Spanish teacher or tutor as you may not be able to notice some of the errors."
4,Never used this product...,"Was never able to motivate myself enough to actually open this book, but from what my friends tell me, it's pretty good. The CD in the made for an excellent firework show in my microwave. Four stars for the fireworks show."
3,It's an OK book.,"This book is not Ross McDonald at his best. It's an early effort.I have several of the old paperbacks of his books still out there I got used from small retailers through Amazon, as well as some of his newly republished classics. I reread them whenever. When I notice them on the shelf.I got The Dark Tunnel because it was something of his that I had not yet read."
2,Way too sweet......can't taste the crabapple.,"This was so sweet, that you couldn't taste the crab apple. Very disappointed. I was hoping for the tartness of the crab apple that I remember from my childhood."
2,not complete,"This is one of my favorite novelas so when I saw it I bought it. I was highly disappointed. It is an abridged version. It is missing some great parts of the saga that made it a pleasure to see on tv. Please do not buy it, it is not complete. You are better off just watching the re-runs and taping it"
5,Great original story!,There are english subtitles.These stories are soo much better than american movies.I never thought Lucero could play a villian with her sweet personality and dreamy singing voice but she pulled it off!Try it... you'll love it too!
2,rip-off,"This is the last dvd telenovela I will ever order online. If you want a complete telenovela you are better off with huluplus, as the majority of these online orders are edited to death!! This one has excellent actors, a great story line ect.., but it is all chopped to hell, the same as other telenovelas I have bought online. I could not even finish watching it after an hour, and just donated it to the library. What a disappointment!!"
3,SUPER abreviada,"Super abridged version (like usual). Other than that, this is on of my favorite story lines. Pero me cae bien todo lo que tiene a la linda de Lucero. Si alquien sabe donde conseguir versiones largas de la serie haganlo saber. Para eso esta fb y todo estos foros eh."
4,Manana es para siempre,"This was a great story, I had seen it under another title( which by the why, you should add to the info on your DVD) The original title is ""Pura Sangre""Even though it was a short version, I thought it was well edited, I totally did not miss any of the fillers of the original story."
2,NOVELA HERMOSA,"Manana es para siemrpe es una novela hermosa! La vi en la television y me encanto! El elenco,los soundtracks todo esta perfecto en la novela solo que han podido hacer mas escenas de cachetadas o peleas pero bueno...de todas formas la novela es buena pero la edicion digo como cortaron la novela para venderla no me gusta! Esque no me gusta que han sacado tantas escenas como por ajemplo la escena que estuvo entre capitulo 150 y 155, cuando Fernanda discuto con su papa y le dijo que Camilo es mal y todo esto y entonses dio una vuelta y grito a la cara de Barbara Y TUU ...la escena fue tan impactante...esque no pude creer que falta la escena y hay muchas escenas que son exelentes pero que no estan en esta edicion! Pero bueno...yo deverdad recomiendo a la gente que vea la novela pero COMPLETA. Y perdon por mi espanol, se que no es tan bien !"
5,Manana es para siempre,"Una historia de amor que nace desde que son ninos,pasan por muchas trajedias,el odio de un ser humano es despiadado y lastima, mata, a gente inocente que por el destino de la vida su padre no lo hacepto como hijo solo por las apariencias al saber de su origen nacio un odio que no tuvo linite, hizo mucho mal a gente que no sabiamn de su existencia, cuando llega el hombre que pondra fin a su odio el por amor a su madre y ala mujer que amado toda su vida esa ayuda desinteresada y con mucho amor logra que todo vuelva a su normalidad y al mismo tiempo nos da lecciones de amor, compacion, y con amor, confiana todo se puede lograr si yo se que una novela pero en ocaciones pasa en la vida real."
4,Living on in style,"The description above mentions aficionados, but I reckon any music lover would take this to their heart. In the five days that I've owned this album it's been the ONLY one I've played - it's that distinctive. Stuart's voice is just magnificent on some of the most wondrous tracks (not simply Big Country songs) that you'll ever be lucky enough to experience. So why only 4 stars? Because the reworkings or demos of old songs are not that special, we've heard them before and some are too weak to even endure. But, at the end of it all, this work underscores the point that, like Offspring, Big Country are too innovative and certainly too awesomely talented to ignore. If Tony Butler's going to drip feed us albums of this class then I can't wait for Rarities IV."
1,terrible,"Silly me...I thought a quintet would be played by 5 instruments, but alas I should have read farther. This arrangement for 25+ strings turns both pieces into a Pablum that would embarrass Arthur Fiedler. I'll have to send it back, because I don't know anyone I dislike enough to give it to."
4,Easier to use than I expected,"After reading the reviews here, I was worried that this clock radio would be nearly impossible to set up. Instead I found the controls to be easy to use, so no complaints there.I also like the way the display changes color and intensity based on what the alarm is doing. It's handy when you're groggy and can't remember whether you turned the alarm off or just hit snooze.I didn't find the humane waking system to be as nice as I expected -- it seems to ramp up too fast -- but it is still a nice thing to have.Right now my primary complaint is that the analog clock has just stopped working, after only a couple weeks of ownership. I'm going to try a few things to see if I can get it to wake up.Overall I am happy with this clock radio, and would recommend it except for the potentially short life of the analog portion."
2,"Impossible to read in the dark, analog clock is flaky","Had this since May 2007, retired it after about 18 months.Pros: The ""humane waking system"" is delightfully gentle to wake up to, and the day-by-day options for the dual alarms were great for weekday versus weekend alarms.Cons: Keep the book handy, this is a complicated machine.Unless you turn it up bright enough that it lights up your room like the sun, the digital readout on this clock is impossible to read in a dark room. I liked the analog clock just for this reason, it was easy enough to read without lights. But, it continuously got stuck at 10:10, just like the picture! The first few times a solid wack fixed it, but alas, eventually that too ceased to work."
2,Great for radio & alarm - terrible for clock,"The radio reception and the different alarm features are great! However, the clock features are absolutely terrible. You have to be within 12 inches of the clock to see the time because it is so dim and blends into the blue background."
4,Great CD to add to any collection.,"This is a quality Jaco recording. The Bass is indeed way up front, but you'll get no arguments from me. I sincerely disbelieve that Jaco was meant to be heard in perfectly mixed and mastered environments. It's raw, but aside from the mixing the sound quality is great. The big band and Jaco are very tight - it's very reminiscent of some of Jaco's live performances with Birelli Lagrene although he doesn't make an appearance on this slbum."
5,Jaco at his finest,"Just the performance on the track ""invitation"" by itself is worth buying it let alone the performances on the rest of the CD. Masterful, Awesome, Inspirational playing that ""burns"" hot!!!"
5,A rack with an important difference.,"I ordered five different racks of this type because I didn't know which one I would like best. The different feature about this one is that it holds items placed in it up off the shelf it sits on. The others hold the items upright, but they are sitting directly on the shelf. This might be important if the item is very delicate or shouldn't get wet if that is a possibility. However, it required that the height of the shelf space be enough to accomodate this feature. The spaces are not as wide as some of the other racks. Unitl I tried to put my large plates and platters in the racks, I did not realize how much of a wide space they required. Measure your items and compare to measurements given for the rack before you order. The racks I ordered are all good, they are just different from each other in small ways. I kept them all."
2,Pain in the....,"Nothing stays upright! If I pull a lid out, all of the lids fall out. I wish the lids would lay a little bit better..."
3,You can find this same product at Walmart,These are best for stacking cookie sheets. Just be sure to allow for the height--you can see the pan will not rest on the bottom of the cabinet. No complaints.
2,Fine,"This is flimsy/lightweight. But I think that is the nature of these products, not just this model itself. Just the way they are designed. Okay, but not great."
2,Un-necessary support wire makes the item fairly useless,"I do not love this item, mostly because of the support wire across both sides. the pans are elevated to a height that makes most of them too tight for the cabinet. Mine is a roll out drawer and the pans get caught, making this item relatively useless."
4,"terrific presentation, great recording, a little square though!","okay, bossa nova was the rage when Harnell released this recording. But it is a lot of fun in a hokey way. Some very ""straight"" musicians did their best to swing hard and the results are admirable. The recording techinque (Kapp Records...can you believe it??!) is top shelf. The darned recording is infectious and will leave you with a smile! The only curiosity is the jacket design. It is not the original I had, which is similar to the second volume of this recording, showing drawings on the cover. So this must be some other country's original 1963 cover. So be it. Fun for casual listening or a cocktail party."
4,Describing the most momentous event,"in the course of Roman history, Jones aptly threads the line between historical analysis and narrative. He assuredly begins the book with a brief, yet astute history of Christianity in the Roman empire and carries through to the legal decrees establishing Christianity as the most favored religion of the empire. Yet, he does not forget to speculate on the plebeian reaction to Constantine's refusal to sacrifice to the Capitoline gods after his ascension to the throne.This book is a wonderful place to begin the exploration of Christianity's role in the Roman empire."
4,Interesting Read,"In my book, ""Astronomical Symbols on Ancient and Medieval Coins"", I devote an entire chapter to the visions of Constantine, the depiction of these visions on Constantinian coinage, and what Constantine actually saw in the heavens. As part of my research, I read numerous books on the life of Constantine, and I found Jones' book, ""Constantine and the Conversion of Europe,"" to be useful.There many items of interest that added to my understanding of the history of his reign, but at times I found this book to be a bit tedious to read compared to some other books about Constantine that I read. Nevertheless, Jones' book is a valuable resource.I recommend this book to all who are interested in Roman history.Marshall Faintich"
3,Puerto Vallarta Bad,"This movie has some well known actors, Harvey Keitel and Scott Glenn. Harvey Keitel plays CIA honcho Walter McGrane and Scott Glenn plays a rogue CIA assasin, Clayton Price, on the lam from the CIA after a hit he executes goes wrong. Price tricks/buys off a couple, a writer, Danny Pastor and Maria De Santos, his girlfriend, to take him through Mexico to the American border for $5,000. Pastor is desperate for money since he has not sold a book in awhile takes Price up on his offer despite the strong objections of his girlfriend, Maria. Pastor is a total idiot and makes all the wrong decisions. They are being chased by the CIA through the outback of Mexico, this does not stop them from hanging out in plain sight in some small Mexican towns. This could've been a really good movie if not for some of the acting and bad or sometimes unbelievable story line. All in all it is watchable. I'd rent this one instead of buy it."
3,For writers who are (or want to be) teachers,"This collection of essays was compiled for teachers of undergraduate and graduate creative writing workshops.The essays in Power and Identity in the Creative Writing Classroom respond to an AWP pedagogy panel addressing the confusion and questions writers face who ""though we may have been hired because we write, are paid to teach"" (ix). The aim of the collection is to present possible pedagogical approaches to creative writing. The essays are organized in four sections: understanding the larger influences (referring to the ideas of creative writing students bring into the classroom); the teacher's place, voice, and style; course design; and, in the classroom (anecdotes about specific teaching experiences). While the essays are arranged under these headings, each offers a very specific, individual voice and argument for an approach to creative writing."
2,"Cute, but doesn't keep time","This clock is pleasant to look at, although a little bigger than I thought. I gave this clock as a gift to be used as a bathroom counter clock. When a new battery was installed in the clock, it was discovered that this clock DOES NOT keep good time! It lost several minutes even within the first hour. So, I cannot recommend this clock if you are actually wanting to use it as a timepiece. I am in the process of determining whether there is something I can do to fix it or if a replacement clock will work."
2,professional make-up artist review,Very very basic. A good tool if you've never applied make-up before in your life.
5,We Need To Go Out of our Minds,"I purchased this book used, and have only just gotten to reading it, and find it mind-blowing. My wife is particularly enthralled with it as it revitalizes her feminist backbone, something that needs to be done around the country during Bush jr's reign. This book is giving her ideas of possibility in reclaiming humanity, with beginning where it all starts: with women taking the reins and making this world right. We are all one; we need to accept each other and stop the violence against women worldwide. We must end war and violence in general in order to attain peace. Sonia is radical in that she recognizes the failures of patriarchy and speaks truth to power. Her thinking is sublime. Wholly recommend this book to awaken the giant that is Woman."
5,Matt Darey is the KING of trance!,"Wow...wow...wow. I've loved Matt Darey's workfor a long time now, and with this, his first U.S. compilation, he delivers the goods. This exceed's Armin van Burren's ""State of Trance"" and even rivals Darey's own ""Ibiza Euphoria"", considered one of the best trance compilations ever. These tracks are fresh, flawlessly mixed, long (longer than most mixed compilations are). You'll find some of Darey's ""classic"" trance, and some hot new trance. You will not get tired of listening to this.I feel lucky Matt is spinning in my hometown of San Francisco this Saturday, May 21...after listening to this several times today, it is only amping my enthusiasm to hear him spin.BUY THIS....and you WILL not be disappointed!"
4,Very happy with this book,"One of my favorite topics is history of African Americans in the West. The book, to be honest, is a bit dated, but still very useful as a starter on this topic."
1,Not good for pendants,"I wish I had given more credibility to the negative reviews. Frankly, I don't understand how there ecould be so many positive reviews. It's an ok chain - if you want to wear it by itself. But it's not good for pendants, as advertised. It remains perfectly stiff and oval shaped when worn - even a large pendant doesn't pull the chain down as a pendant normally does. I'm returning it."
5,The perfect answer,I had ordered a pendant to wear to a family wedding and needed a chain. This Omega was the perfect answer. This item is well worth the money.
1,Not very good at all,This necklace is like a strong circle of silver. there was almostno bend to it at all and it was not fluid.
1,False Advertising!!!,"This is NOT a chain necklace. If you buy this product you will get an 18"" long, 1.26 mm diameter tube with tiny notches along its surface. The ""strong lobster clasp"" looks like it's made of cheap plastic."
4,nice gift for a young girl,"I ordered this necklace for a young girl to hold a little turtle pendant I purchased for her. The pendant has some weight and does come with its own chain, but I thought the omega would give this young girl a different, but still delicate look. She will be able to use this chain with any pendant she may have or receive in the future. It's a sweet necklace that, once she grows out of it, can be passed on to one of her younger sisters. I was pleased with my purchase."
4,Great chinese play food for kids.,Great toy for little ones (but not too little because they want to eat it).
1,"A reflection on the publisher, NOT the author","Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this particular publication.I was thoroughly enjoying the book, until page 176 of ""Goodbye to Berlin"", at which point I was in utter confusion until I realised pages 176 & 177 were repeated from the first story in the book, ""The Last of Mr. Norris"".I don't seem to be able to find the content of those missing pages anywhere online and I have NOT received a response from the publisher, New Directions (editorial@ndbooks.com)."
4,"Fun, tragic, fictional, and true.","Based on Isherwood's real experiences in Berlin, the two novels in Berlin stories both follow the same pattern: they get you interested, and draw you into a fun world, and then they turn tragic . . . and the power of the last twenty pages is surprising."
2,"The book speaks for itself, but LOOK FOR AN ERRATA SHEET!!!","I am an Amazon reviewer who focuses on pointing out the utilitarian flaws or benefits of a given product; if you are looking for literary criticism, then this review will disappoint. My review, however, is critical if you want to make sure you have a complete copy of 'The Berlin Stories.' If you order the item, check to see if an errata sheet is included anywhere in the book. It's the size of a single sheet of paper slighly larger than the book and will be loosely inserted somewhere in the text. IF THIS SHEET IS NOT INCLUDED, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMPLETE COPY OF THE BOOK! The printer made an error at page ninety-six (96) of ""The Last of Mr. Norris"" and, as a result, the story loses both continuity and completeness.This review refers exclusively to the copy of 'Berlin Stories' with the ""double shadow"" cover and an ISBN of 9-780811-218047; I do not know whether the same error was made in previous editions."
4,Interesting look at pre-war Berlin,"While nowhere near as fleshed out as ""Cabaret""--the film that was constructed from this and ""I am a Camera,"" THE BERLIN STORIES are still great entertainment and a valuable look into pre-war Berlin and Germany.Isherwood brings to life the squalid conditions and the ""many families in one place"" atmosphere that adds to the gloom and doom, and also the human interactions that makeup these stories.If you're planning to delve into the land of Christopher Isherwood, I highly suggest this writing of his, along with his wonderful, though extremely extensive autobiographies. Great fodder about Stravinsky, Los Angeles, Arthur Kallman, and a host of others around the ""LA roundtable"" that is also a time capsule of an era we will never see again."
1,Excellent book. Horrible publishing.,"I highly recommend this book, but try and find it from another publisher. This edition is missing two pages of text."
2,Looks better than it is.,"This set looks so nice on line and in the pictures, but when one gets ready to actually set it up, it is disappointing. So portable and nice looking in its carrying bag, but the net was unstable and difficult to set up and not as secure as we would have hoped. It did the job but was a bit flimsy."
5,Perfect fit,"I have a small kitchen and the pot rack fit perfectly above the sink right next to the stove, and was sturdy enough for my whole set of hard anodized steel cookware and utensils. And it looks nice too."
4,A good single from a truly excellent album,"You've probably heard the title song by now, if you have been listening to the radio at all this spring. ""As I Sat Sadly By Her Side"" is a stunningly beautiful song, and Cave's voice really shines on this one. Even with a running time of more than 6 minutes the song is not a second too long. A masterpiece. ""Little Janey's Gone"" is a mellow song, and wouldn't be out of tune on the album. ""Good Good Day"" is a more up-tempo song, and is (IMHO) more of a throwaway to be honest. Fair enough, but one can understand why it didn't make it on the album. As this is an import for you US people, the price may be a bit steep if you're not a die-hard fan, but if you can pick this up at a reasonable price you should give it a try."
1,poor design for actually USING this item for intended purpose,"I gave mine to the Good Will after a couple frustrating months of trying to ""get used"" to the quirks.... which are:The slots for ""sponges"" etc., do not drain! after a few days you can begin to see disgusting black mold fill the corners - so, you get to spend time cleaning the item that was supposed to help you to clean OTHER items.Also (and this may just be my hang-up) when you pick this caddy up and squirt into a soaking bowl in the sink, etc., the item is very awkward and the sponges tend to fall out.The idea of this is good but the design, in my opinion, is flawed.I purchased a clear soap dispenser (which I found on Amazon through reader recommendations, thanks) and also a separate sponge holder - with drain holes.....Can not recommend the Interdesign #67080"
1,Waste of money,"This one of the worst purchases that I've made. The sponge trays do not drain so you get mold. The soap dispenser leaks soap around the neck, so you get soap globs all over the dispenser. The product rusts. There is nothing good about this product. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Ridiculous,"It's ridiculous they designed a product to be used near a sink that can't handle getting wet. The sponge trays don't drain so your sponge will never fully dry and quickly gets disgusting and smelly. The ""stainless steel"" is just the look, not the actual material, apparently. Within days of use it started sprouting rust spots all over the silver areas. It looks horrible now and here I am shopping for a higher-quality replacement. Why would anyone even think of creating a product to be used near water that's made of a material that rusts? Don't waste your money on this product."
2,"Inexpensive, But Inexpensively Made","I would concur with the other reviewers, here. Not having a drain for the sponge is a real design oversight. The soap dispenser occasionally clogs and then 'splatt!', just as you're dressed for work or headed out to dinner, you have soap all over the front of you. I'm not sure this doesn't happen with other dispensers, but it has only added to my displeasure with this one. If you need a cheap dispenser (moving off to college), this is fine. However, the main reason that I'm throwing this dispenser away and looking for another, the ""stainless steel"" cap. Not long after I purchased the dispenser, it began to corrode and split. I risk a jagged cut to my fingers (have done this a number of times) each time I have to unscrew the cap to refill. Cheap, cheap, cheap."
3,"Nice to use, but falls apart","I really like this soap dispenser. The only problem is that it falls apart after a year or two. I bought a replacement, and probably will do again when this one breaks unless I find a better alternative."
1,"DON'T BUY! Rusts, looks terrible, leaks!","Seems like a good idea, until you use it. The soap container leaks after not very long at all, so the soap that leaks out causes the container itself to rust and leave rust stains on the counter and sink. The space under the sponge holder also gets soap leaked into that, so it looks permanently gross and rusty. For something that's supposed to make your life look neater and more organized, it's a disgusting mess.DON'T BUY!"
1,Do not waste your $$!,"I just threw this sucker away today! The area for the sponges doesn't drain at all, so unless you wash it often, you will have mold growing. Also, the neck of the soap dispenser leaks horribly and this thing rusts in no time flat. Save your money!!"
1,What a mess!,"The soap leaks out the bottom and creates a big mess. Apparently there is no seal between the plastic and the bottom ""stainless."" The soap leaks out slowly, so eventually you notice hard white crust on the seam. Too bad...it looks great, but has to be scrubbed every few days...and you lose a lot of liquid soap in the process!"
1,I agree,I purchased this thinking it was a good design but when actually using it discovered it was one of the worst purchases I've ever made and have thrown it out after only a couple of months usage. It does not drain. it molds. it looks old quickly. it is not helpful whatsoever. the sad part is I bought it retail and paid a lot more than this for it.
2,A SO-SO MOVIE!,Bill Paxton gave a performance as a brutal soldier and a womanizer. A weak performance. Bad movie.
2,ok if you want a quick and pretty lame version of the war,"having seen many vietnam movies, i have to say this was one of the least enjoyable. I have to agree with several of the reviews below that this is a made for TV movie, which is ok. It does have that NBC type of acting to it, where the drama is a little over board to prove a point. good for education but that is about it. for those who are looking for a decent war movie, that has some education in it, rent it. for those who are looking for a documentary on the developments of vietnam, the society, the war itself, and America during the post vietnam period, I HIGHLY suggest purchasing VIETNAM The Ten Thousand Day War. That is a 5 star by far. As a follow up, buy In Retrospect by Robert McNamara. This is also on tape but leaves out a lot from the book. Both this DVD and book will provide you with in depth detail on what took place in Vietnam, and why. Why did the American Government do what they did."
4,How did it all begin??,"This is film falls into that unique category of Vietnam movies: how did we get into it so deeply? Based on the excellent book of the same title, the film follows Lt. Col. John Paul Vann, an extraordinary man of vision who both understood the nature of the conflict and (in the end) fell victim to American frustrations over not winning. Good performance by ol' Bill. If you liked this movie, I suggest also seeing ""Go Tell The Spartans""."
2,a bright shining lie,It is a movie for TV with low budget and low performances. The ideas for the movie is good for educating my young children. To teach them a bit history of Vietnam war. I complete agreed with the review of Gabe Michael Bugielski. I got this DVD in a package of seven. I wish they excluded it.
1,One of the worst Vietnam movies of all time!,"What do all these people see in this lame movie? It has almost no combat (and what it does have is below average), The story's boring, and the acting is bad. If you want a GOOD Nam movie buy Hamburger Hill or Platoon. Forget this Pathetic excuse for a Nam movie."
4,Still sounds good,"Forget ""I melt with you."" I haven't been able to listen to that song in about 10 years (from overplay). This album is much more than that once enjoyable song. In fact I just listened to it and after owning this album since around 1985 I think it has dated well and is very solid. It's certainly very much of its era, but if you like early '80s new wave at all this would be a good album to own.I also recommend _Ricochet Days_ as being equal to _After the Snow_, although I haven't heard it in over 10 or 12 years. It's been out of print in the U.S."
5,Max's Dragon Shirt book,"I received my order in a timely fashion and the product was exactly as described. The book has a beautiful hard cover which looks like it can withstand some harsh treatment from little hands. I purchased it for my grand-daughter's birthday, who is a Max & Ruby fan. We've already read it many times over and I'm sure she'll be requesting I read it to her again! If you aren't familiar with Max, he's a 3-year-old bunny brother to older sister Ruby. My husband doesn't always like the story lines for this pair because Max sometimes gets away with misbehaving without consequences. The Dragon Shirt story stays true to this complaint, but I noticed that Ruby contributes to the problem by leaving her brother alone instead of keeping a watchful eye over him at all times. The lesson here may be directed more at care-takers than to those in our care!"
3,Only a little better than average,"This is not a review, only an observation of surprise at the uniformly glowing reception for a book which clearly falls short in so many ways. In spite of the general consensus, I have to say that I found it opaquely constructed, tortuously circuitous and needlessly repetitive. Historical characters, Alexander included, were not drawn with anything like the skill needed to help me identify with them. On top of this, my copy of the film tie-in edition (pictured) is littered with spelling mistakes, typos and misaligned characters. Not the author's fault, admittedly, but when you throw in smudgy illegible maps on top you end up wondering why you bothered. To anybody who thinks that this is first-rate popular history I suggest that you read Tom Holland's 'Rubicon' or 'Persian Fire' to see how powerfully the ancient world can be conjured up."
3,Alexander the Great,Very thorough research and detail makes some of this book a bit slow at which is fascinating first. But it leave out nothing of the history
3,some dry reading,This book was interesting but there are some distractions and dry areas. Mr fox at times give a complete history of people Alexander is involved with and causes confusing and dry reading at times
2,Far from the best,"I honestly do not understand the accolades this book has received. From the start , Fox gushes how the Greeks invented politics, history, ethics, theater and writing about human drama...no one asked a philosphical question before the Greeks...come on Mr Fox!...what about the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, and other Asian societies? Did the Greeks invent fire, the wheel, agriculture as well? The book reads like a high school textbook- grandiose, superfluous,wordy, out of focus. Many reviewers applaud Fox's psychological insight. I never saw this. For true psychological insight, as well as lucid writing and thoughtful conjecture, read Peter Green's Alexander the Great. The photographs in Fox's book will serve as a useful complement."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"This book could have been considerably better if there was more on the life, more about the man and less narrative, less redundant background information, and less speculation."
4,good,"book is good at least until now I like it, but I think the author can put more maps with the campaign ant city"
3,book review,"I thought the book was good, but a little confusing at times. For example when the chapter of Alexander and India it talks about the battle of Hydaspes River and then all of a sudden goes back to the start of the invasion and then talks about the battle again. I learned that Alexander was not only an amazing tactician, but also a kind man to some people. I would recommend this book to those who like ancient history and have enough time on their hands to read it. Yes I would say this book is ""Important"" for people who have been able to achieve so much should be remembered and this book goes into great detail of Alexander."
4,Takes you for a long ride...,"I've picked this book up in a Florida mall basicly because the movie just came out featuring Colin Farrell. The film took me 3 hours and the book took me 3 months, but every piece of extra time was worth it.This book describes the hardships during the journey and is comprehensive in detail. Seeing the movie afterwards made it feel like so much detail was missing, it just wasn't the whole story. And the movie was based largely on this book.If you like the movie and want to take it a step further, I recommend this book. This is the real story."
1,Maps on Kindle edition are atrocious,"Considering how important maps are to a book like this, Amazon should be ashamed of itself.It looks like they got grandma to get out the old photocopier she used to use and copy the maps from a dusty version of the print edition.For this negligence in providing a crucial aspect of the book, one star is appropriate....The text itself seems interesting so far."
1,know your geography and grains,"Mr Fox lost his way on the plains of Macedonia somehow ending up in pre-Colombian America when he writes of passing through""corn"" fields in Ancient Greece. In Asia his foragers were looking for ""corn"" again when it was something they never knew of in that time period. Mr. Fox takes a cheap shot at the Bible as well by calling the Bible account of Esther ""a myth"" all the while acknowledging the accuracy of Persian king's harem problemscontained therein. This I found only a quarter of the way throughhis book, since I paid for it I'll continue reading on, hoping for better research on his part as I go."
5,"Brilliant, beautifully written, enthralling","A marvellous biography of a fascinating man. Lane Fox was taught classics at Oxford by some of the century's heavyweights - George Forest, Andrews etc... and is himself a renowned teacher. His book is ten times better than the stilted prose of most modern academics. Homer's influence, his father's legacy, the campaigns, the famous Last Plans all covered. The final few pages show a feel for a subject very very rare in modern academia."
5,Highest recommendations!,"Well researched, very readable and fascinating - the absolute best on Alexander that I've ever read. I can't recommend this book enough!"
5,Tuttis trombones,My father had Tuttis trombones when I was a kid. Some of the best musicians coupled with great arrangements. Makes you want to play the trombone.
5,Has this orchestra ever sounded better?,Why must we wait for the re-issue of 1 & 3? These recordings are a joy.
1,NOT for the serious musician,"I purchased this based on the sound clips and other reviews and am quite disappointed. To get a general idea of the pieces for a cheap price, this is fine, but for serious listening/enjoyment by any musician, look elsewhere. I have to wonder if this is truly Philadelphia on the recording. They are known for a wonderful lush string sound but there were too many shocking ""yuck/ouch!"" moments from the violins. The winds also had some unpleasant intonation issues occasionally. I would have expected much better from this orchestra."
4,"Danzig 2 lucifuge is the devil,s plaything!!","Danzig 2 lucifuge was danzig,s 2nd album and was released in 1990.danzig 2 was again produced by famous producer rick rubin and the results were very strong.danzig 2 was more stylistically diverse than the first album but every bit as strong and as usual cool dark lyrical themes!in my opinion the great tunes on here are;long way back from hell,killer wolf,777,devil,s plaything,her black wings, blood and tears,girl and i,m the one are great reasons to own this cd!!play this one loud!"
5,The Danzig Everyone Wants Done Again...,"Too much has already been written about this album.If you missed the boat, check Misfits, then Samhain (pronounced Sah-Win...impress your friends!) and then come back to Danzig if you like those.Many things have been written about Danzig. The town, the man, the album, the band, the groupies...ahh, screw it. Uh, pun intended?If you don't like Danzig, this won't change your mind. If you do like Danzig, you should already own this.What are you waiting for?"
4,"Danzig 2:Electric Boogaloo (Sorry, force of habit)","Danzig 2 stands out as being the first album where Gleen started to drift toward blues influences in his music. This is made much more apparent on his third album ""How the Gods Kill"". This is a very good album, while not as good as the first Danzig album, is in my opinion better than the third. With tracks like Killer Wolf, 777, and the melodic Devil's Plaything, one can not go wrong with purchasing this album, esspecially if one is a fan of Danzig."
4,Danzig on the Bayou,"There's something extra dark and extra special on this one.It sounds as if it were recorded on a humid Summer night somewhere in the country.There's a dirty and deep feel that goes beyond the dry AC/DC sounds of Danzig I. Something about it also rings fresher than the studio sound of Danzig III.Slide guitar, stripped down blues meanderings...A moderate amount of experimentation can be heard as well...""Blood and Tears"" marks Glenn's first true attempt at a ballad, and the refrain of ""Tired of being alive"" initiates an ethos unseen to this point; almost the antithesis of the invincible swagger of ""Mother."" Pain, alienation and warning are the themes.This may well be the quintessential Danzig release.A dark and melancholy preview of things to come."
1,Nothing original,"I bought this single under the impression that it would be original, but now I think Techno-Music has gone past it's sell by date.A lot of this type of music is being produced by keyboard players and sound mixers from the eighties who believe they are one step of the music game in copying other people's music.Big thumbs down, I'm afraid."
1,You're Kidding...,"This late-night drunken thrash-session was never meant to see the light of day. Zevon's vocals are a mess, and although REM can play their own tunes fine (part of their magic was their simplicity), they just aren't high-caliber musicians when it comes to tackling covers. I found this ""performance"" to be more like a beer-and-whiskey fueled frat night where a few guys who knew they weren't very good got together for the hell of it, and fortunately it was a weekend when the campus was a bit deserted. In a word, horrific. Save your money..."
4,Fun blues covers from Zevon & R.E.M.,"This was recorded during the sessions for Warren Zevon's Sentimental Hygiene album, on which Messrs. Buck, Berry, and Mills guested for eight tracks. This wasn't meant for release, though Zevon's label at the time put it out anyway. For such off the cuff material, it sure sounds like the four Love Gods were having a ball. ""Walkin' Blues"" and ""Raspberry Beret"" are the high points."
4,REM and Zevon good stuff,"I like this CD especially Prince's cover of ""Raspberry Beret"". The other songs are okay, but the Blues tune is way too long. However, I'm glad I bought this CD, just for the Prince cover is worth it."
5,If You Like Submarines.....,"..This is THE book.....whatever it lacks in physical size it makes up for INSIDE the covers!A full history of all major submarines from their inception to the present from ALL countries is what you find. A plethora of stats, comments and marvelous illustrations await you on this voyage. At the end of the sub listings are the ordinance they all use which is a great addendum to this already fine publication.Mr Jackson has done himself (and the navies of the world) proud with this book.A must have for anyone interested in the ""dark deep""!"
5,Defining this moment in rock music,"Glam Rock was a short lived moment in popular music that essentially lasted only about five or six years, say from 1970 to 1975. In 1970 we were long past the time when Ed Sullivan would only show Elvis from the waist up. The pill has made basic changes in the outlook of the young towards sex. Here in the US, the Viet Nam war, Watergate and Kent state were changing the view of the people.In music the time was ripe for a change and a series of musicians did that with a new form of rock that featured extremely theatrical performances with outrageous (for the time) costume, makeup and sets. This was called Glam Rock. It drew upon the history of previous styles of rock and added a theatrical aspect to music that was minimally modified.This book traces the history of Glam Rock from its beginnings with T. Rex and goes through the advent of Suzi Quatro. It explains what Glam Rock was and a bit about how it evolved into the next phase of music."
1,THIN and CHEAP,"Yes, they are soft, but you can practically see through them. And I washed them the first time before ever using them and there are holes already! Piece of garbage. I want my money back!"
3,First Mario-Centered Game,"This was the origional game STARRING mario (and luigi). I know, mario first appeared in donkey kong--though donkey kong stole the attention.This game is so fun! It is the jumping and going through pipes game; it also is used as a verses battle mode in super mario brothers 3. The baddies are simple and the pipes are easy. The goal, to stun the enemies and grap their coin, is rather straightforward. This game can still manage to be fun and tricky to this day. It can be played 2 player also."
5,Fantasic,"These boxes are absolutely fantasic...they are very pretty, the silver accents on the box are shaped into what looks like falling leaves. The texture of the box is also lovely. You can feel each little silver fleck on the box. The box is also very sturdy as well as roomy. I really recommend these boxes."
5,Learn the Universal Laws and improve your life!,"In take Charge of Your Life, Patricia Diane Cota-Robles teaches us how to apply the Universal laws of abudance in order to be financially prosperous. She was already teaching about the Law of giving, in order to receive, back in 1983. You must read this chapter in order to find out what the Law is!Each one of her books teaches us something that we can apply to our lives today.I learned something new on Chapter 8, The Mysterious Chakras, and that is the ""two functioning levels of the chakras: spiritual and physical"", and much, much more.She gives us Affirmations and was already teaching about ""the power of thought"" back in 1983, when this book was first published.I have received no compensation for this review."
3,"Polybius's Histories, Loeb Classical Library Edition","Great history of Rome, translation is okay. Includes the Greek language text on left page, English on right. Please note: This is one of six volumes! This is not clear from the description of the books.The Penguin version, a better/clearer translation, does not include the Greek. One volume, not complete. May be more accessible for most readers. Is certainly less expensive!"
1,Misleading Info about audio cassettes,I ordered the book after all the research. Editorial notes had misleading information about audio cassettes included. No cassettes are included. What is the point of buying this book without audio. It is meaningless.
4,Thank you,Thank you for sending my book in a timely manner. I received it sooner than I had expected. I was able to keep up with my class due to you quick response.
4,Jumping the Scratch,"I thought that this book was pretty good because it had many different obstacles that Jamie had to overcome through out the book, not just one problem."
5,Excellent... floor packing Song!,"I love this CD. It is great energy on my dance floor... Whenever I play it, I get club patrons inquiring what it is...If you like VengaBoys, or even harder High Energy Dance Music... you will love Rollergirl's Luv U More!Dj Dom Armano"
3,I love the '90s!,"C.M.B. by Color Me Badd was a cd I couldn't get enough of in 1991. I remember falling in love with this group when I heard Adore Mi Amore on the radio. Of course the song they are remembered for is I Wanna Sex You Up, still sounds good to this day. Thinkin' Back is the stongest track on the album and All 4 Love is pure pop candy. You can't take this album too seriously, it's just for fun."
3,Brought back memories,I wanted this cd for just one song (sex you up) but i know remember like five.
3,"Dated, but packed with '90s Goodness!","Listening to this in 2007, it sounds very obviously dated, but still, its a telling remnant of the early 1990s soundscape. The great part about this is that it has two songs that STILL sound amazing - ""I Adore Mi Amor"" and ""Thinkin' Back"", while most of the others sound very, very generic.The early 90s pop machine was a strange thing indeed - much of it sounds terrible today. But this album still stands out because of its high hit quotient (six Billboard Hot 100 singles - a remarkable achievement).Should you buy this? Yes. Its definitely more memorable than the later days output of say, the Backstreet Boys - but if you're looking for some wholesome 1990s goodness, you can do much worse than this."
4,Good Stuff!,"Color Me Badd's debut album after the smash single, I wanna sex u up, this has a lot of songs that you'll be humming in your mind. All for love, I ador mi amor, thinking back are all great songs. My first album ever, one of my favourites!"
4,"SPRING BREAK OF ""91"" THIS WAS THE CD TO HAVE! AND STILL IS!","CLASS OF ""91"" THIS IS FOR YOU.REMEMBER THE MOVIE NEW JACK CITY.WITH WESLEY SNIPES AND ICE-T;REMEMBER THE SOUNDTRACK.EVERYONE HAD IT AND THE SONG THEY PLAYED THE MOST ON IT WAS I WANNA SEX YOU UP.ALL FOR LOVE,THINKIN BACK,I ADORE ME AMORE, I WANNA SEX YOU UP.WERE THE SONGS I HEARD AT DAYTONA BEACH BACK IN THE SUMMER OF 91.I THINK NOW OR EVEN SINCE 2000 HOW CAN ANYBODY CAN LIKE THE BACKSTREET BOYS,N`SYNC,98 DEGREES.AND THEN I THINK ABOUT HOW THINGS WERE BACK IN HIGH~SCHOOL.

2,COLOR WHO WHAT??!,"oh baby, this is precious, someone here is actually comparing CMB to The Beatles?!?! Is that why CMB's CD is selling for a whopping 21 cents? I'd love to continue but the urge for uncontrollable laughter is just way too much, ha ha ha ha ha ha.........."
3,TOP GUN up there with the best of the best,This is a great book that is based on the 1986 hit movie Top Gun. If you liked the movie you will definetly like the book.
2,Welcome to the Monkey House,Book described as like a collectible. Buyers not informed that pages brown and former owner's name written in blue ink inside book on first page.
5,A celebration of the beauty of humanity's imperfection.,"Each of these stories is a world in its own right; all ofthem speak from a deep understanding of what it means to behuman. Ranging from true (The Long Walk to Forever/Hell toGet Along With), through plausible (Adam), to dark futurism(Harrison Bergeron, the title story), Vonnegut celebrateslife, love, and freedom... and in every story, you will seethe world you know. Both tragic and comic, these storiesshow us what we are, and make us glad of it. Anunforgettable read - don't miss it!"
3,not the book I wanted,The reason that I gave the review this title is because of the cover. I actually wanted the book with the brown cover and the monkey reaching out. The one I got has a creamish color and at the top a small picture of a gorilla in a cage. I was trying to duplicate a copy of the book that has been lost and the picture of the book in the listing matched so I thought that was what I would get. I wish the seller had actually shown the book he was selling. The content is the same but the book feels heavier (I think it may have more pages which means that the type face or printing margins must be different.
3,Si-Fi Great,Kurt Vonnegut blended literature and science fiction into a genre all his own. This classic story is a good read for any fan of Vonnegut who may have missed it before.
3,"I DO, AND I DID!","If you find Vonnegut heavy sledding, perhaps there are some pleasant surprises for you among these short stories.Normally I find reading his work very similar to a class assignment."
2,Not proofread,"The errors introduced by the OCR scan were not removed. It's not even that they missed some, they must not have checked at all, because the name of the main villain in the story ""Harrison Bergeron"" (one of the all time great stories ever) is horribly botched (Diana Moon Glampers, the US Handicapper General, is now ""Diana Moon dampers"" [no capitalization!]). Worth $1.99 as today's Kindle special deal, a rottenvalue at its regular price."
4,Good read.,If you are a Vonnegut fan I would recommend giving this book a whirl. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
2,"Great stories, horrible OCR errors","First of all, the stories here are great. There is a great variety so if you don't like some of the far out Vonnegut novels you will find some normal fiction here. I breezed through the stories and did not find any of them bad.However, this edition is full of many, many, many editing problems. Is his name Mr. Hammer or Mr. Flammer? I don't know! Many free Kindle books have better editing than this one. It is very frustrating."
5,VONNEGUT!,"One of my favorite authors. I can't help loving everything this man has written. His stories are painful to read, sometimes, but everything that is painful has underlying truth. I have never found a Vonnegut story that didn't resonate with me."
4,Good stuff,"This book was just fun. I couldn't stop reading it. I can't say that I came out of it with any new outlooks on life, but I definitely came out of it feeling good that I read this book."
2,Not that great compared to his other books.,"Don't get me wrong, there are moments of brilliance in this book. The story about the human chess match comes to mind, but many of the stories are conventional and sappy. None of the biting dark humour that you find in his better works like Cat's Cradle and the Sirens of Titan. Still, it's better than a lot of books, but all in all I was very disapointed. ..."
3,Good service,"I received my book promptly, however it was missing its front cover, which had not been mentioned in the description. I contacted the seller and they promptly refunded my money. I would have been happier to get a book with a cover, but a prompt refund was a good response from the seller."
1,"Beware, admirers of Vonnegut!","""Monkey House"" is a reminder that even the greatest artists had humble beginnings. This collection of Vonnegut's early work is shallow and boring and almost made me forget the great joy he has brought. I would recommend it neither to the Vonnegut novice or fanatic."
5,bite-sized chunks,"If you don't already know Kurt Vonnegut's work, this may be the best introduction to it -- especially considering that short stories are the art form that Vonnegut started out with, where he developed his craft.And if you already know Vonnegut but don't know this book, then think of this as the author in delicious bit-sized chunks.But read the book!I would not say that Welcome to the Monkey House is Vonnegut's best book -- in fact, it may not even be in the top five by my calculations -- but it is the one book of his I would keep if I had to give all the other away, simply because of the diversity of the stories he tells and the simple writing skill they illustrate.And I might argue that the best single STORY Vonnegut ever wrote is ""Harrison Bergeron"" the riveting and still-relevant tale about human nature that effects me as much today as it did when I first read it 20 years ago. Vonnegut without a doubt proves with this story that all writers are not created equal."
5,Great collection of short stories by the Master,"Terrific reading material for a raining afternoon. Among my favorite short stories wereTom Edison's Shaggy Dog, The Euphio Question, Deer in the Works (which must have been an obvious influence on Terry Gilliams Brazil and a satire of big business and mindless capitalism) and Unready to Wear."
4,welcome to the monkey house,the novel is good but the shipping time was very lengthy wanted it sooner other than that the product was as discribed
1,EWWW,"My teacher, made us read Welcome to the Monkey House, it is really sick and a disgusting story. u would never in a million year read this story again, I would just RIP IT IN HALF AND THROW IT OUT !!"
1,early vonnegut short stories,"I was terribly interested to read this book as I am, admittedly, a huge fan of Vonnegut. However, these short storie are absolutely terrible. All critiques of the writing style aside, the thing that got me the most was the the short story from which the anthology got its name advocates rape. I understand that these are stories that Vonnegut wrote to support himself and his family and to fund his novels, and as such can not particularly be seen as his 'vision', but they truely are terribly written and often ideoligically insulting."
5,Vintage Kurt Vonnegut,Kurt Vonnegut's ironic humor in bite sized packages. Each story is just long enough to be a satisfying bedtime read.
4,Cadre,"Typical Vonnegut. well written, entertaing....a very good deal for a very good book. I own several of his books, but hard copies, love being able to carry a portable library.JJG"
4,An impressive collection of short stories,"Typically, I prefer full length novels to short stories, but I decided to give this book of short stories by Vonnegut a try after reading 2BOR2B a while back. I was surprised to find myself plowing through the collection. Among my favorites were ""Harrison Bergeron,"" ""Next Door,"" ""The Manned Missiles,"" and ""The Euphio Question."" Each story seemed to have its own unique feel and twist to it, and I was impressed by Vonnegut's ability to write such varied stories. I found it to be a good introduction to Vonnegut."
1,I disliked the edits in this version,There are substantial edits in this version of Infinity Hold (the first of three stories in the book). In my opinion the edits do nothing to improve the story and in some instances steal the heart from the story to the extent that they make what is one of the greatest SF stories of all time rather poor and unejoyable to read.I would strongly urge owners of the first edition who love the story never to read the reprint in this book.As to the second and third stories they are well writen but I feel they lack the soul of the original
4,A Wonder,I hadn't read anything new by Longyear in probably two decades. To see that he turned Infinity Hold into a trilogy was pretty cool. He not only did the original justice but improved the whole thing. The sense of hope I was left with when I completed the reading is a testament to the author's gift as a writer and his compassion as a human being.Victot
4,an underrated gem,"For all their 'kooky weirdness', the B-52s knew how to craft songs, and this album has gems to spare: ""Queen of Las Vegas"", ""Legal Tender"" and ""Butterbean"" are excellent. You can certainly tell this album was recorded in 1983, but the sometimes clunky synth sounds are part of the album's charm. The album tails off after peaking with ""Queen..."", but where's their recording of ""Don't Worry""? It's been replaced in recent pressings by the anodyne ""Moon 83"", which only highlights the album's weak finish."
5,great disc,"i think its one of there best ones and last good one sadly,there has been a song here or there that l have liked since but this was the last of a great string of albums starting with there first and endind with this one."
4,Ricky Wilson was a great guitarist!,"Trism, Song for a Future Generation, Queen of Las Vegas...and the early MTV hit Legal Tender... ""Whammy"" is loaded with some incredibly catchy songs.I could not agree less with the reviewer who said ""easily the worst thing in their catalogue"". I would definitely give that honor to ""Good Stuff"" ""Bouncing Off the Satellites"", or ""The Flintstones"" soundtrack. Whammy may feature one drum machine too many, but it's bursting with energy and originality. Ricky Wilson was a great minimalist guitarist and I think after his passing the band lost its backbone. I saw the B-52s in concert in New York a couple of years ago and was surprised at the relatively lackluster and unengaging show, the highlight watching an elderly Fred Schneider do some goofy dance moves. The B-52's of ""Whammy"" were an exciting, volatile band."
4,offbeat fun,"I bought the `Cosmic Thing' CD first and enjoyed it... going to the beginning with the first B-52's CD. `Butterbean' is my favorite track... where else could you find such a thing? Fred Schneider, Kate Pierson, Cindy Wilson, Keith Strickland and Brian Wilson... the Fun Five."
2,Weak in both music and lyrics,"I am a fan of the B-52's and for a long time I never had the desire to buy this CD, but eventually decided to give it a try. I was disappointed with a number of things with this CD. First was the music itself. It seems as if the band was either not motivated to write and record or they were maybe in a slump. It's just that none of the songs have a strong impact and leaves one wanting. Possibly it's the way the songs were produced, they are just missing the extra bit of punch. Lastly I have to say the lyrics seem to be something my son could have come up with; nothing creative or inspirational. I know that the songs are suppose to be fun, but not this simplistic. Compared to the first two albums, this one falls far short."
4,It's the original B-52s... is there anything else to say?,"I tend to like the albums that they made prior to Ricky's death much more than those that came after his passing. He was the heart and soul of the group. Even though this wasn't one of their best albums, it still retained the uniqueness of their style. Those that came after Ricky died became too commercialized and mainstream. My favorite cut in this will always be Big Bird... LOL"
3,"Funny in quite a few places, but not in others.","Dice in his early days shows himself as being chovenistic, and not care about feelings of others. He basically says that women should be barefoot and in the kitchen (not really but it's the general idea) and if I had seen a guy like Dice come in trying to sweet talk my mother during the funeral for my father (who passed away this past May), I would've gotten a baseball bat and chased him out of the place. Now that aside, takes like his redoing of his rhymes, the milk and shampoo episode, having kids, first kiss, and ""hour, back, get it"" were hilarious. This album isn't so bad, but PUH-LEEZE save your money on the sequel."
2,"Oh, so disappointing","I am a Dice great fan. I have almost everything he has ever done. This is the WORST album of his. Buy ""Dice"", buy ""Dice Rules"". Dont buy this one."
2,Here's my problem....,"I've read this series since 1989 or so and have thought it consistently excellent. This volume, however, is almost entirely made of exceptionally eccentric poetry that will alienate almost all readers. As I read it, I kept thinking about this: Somewhere a thoughtful, educated and well-read person decides he or she will finally take time to explore what is going on in today's poetry. Our hypothetical friend goes to his or her local bookseller and finds ""The Best American Poetry 2002"" and understandably concludes this is an ideal book with which to start. It would likely be his or her last purchase of contemporary poetry. It's very much unbalanced and is simply not at all representative of poetry in 2002. The editor indulges his own taste for the inaccessible and quirky with no consideration for the task of presenting, well, ""The Best American Poetry."""
1,Ugh!,"Besides the very fine introduction by David Lehman, this has to be the most abstruse collection of poetry I have ever read. I am a college teacher and have traditionally used the Best American series in my classes. Year after year, it has been my favorite poetry anthology. I had my students purchase this edition before I had a chance to look through it this year and I am worried that a collection like this will just fortify all their worse preconceptions about poetry: elitist, inside, arch, academic, and bloodless. It seems to be an elaborate joke played by Creeley on the whole idea of a ""Best American Poetry"". Could his taste possibly be so narrow? Perhaps this issue should be called ""The Best American Language Poetry"" or ""The Best American Poetry out of The University of Buffalo."""
5,crazy,"I don't think anybody but Robert Creeley & David Lehman would have compiled this selection of poems, & it's an essential volume, full of all kinds of crazy experiments in modern poetry & a few incredibly beautiful brilliant more formalist poems. I think books in the Best American Poetry series are a great way to get to know some of modern poetry, & if you're a writer, to find some journals to submit your work to."
2,Unfortunately,"Few of the poems in this collection struck fire in me, a smaller percentage than earlier volumes in the series."
2,An Unsurprising Disappointment,"Reader take note: if you are curious about contemporary poetry and are looking for an interesting place to start, this anthology is not for you. Try 2001 or 2003. Skip 2002. One of the interesting things about this series is discovering the guest editor, always a notable contemporary poet, as reader of contemporary poetry. What exactly was Robert Creeley thinking? Most of the poems in this volume are emminently forgettable; others unreadable. I enjoy reading this anthology every year, but in this case it was a real struggle."
1,LINE YOUR BIRD CAGE WITH A POEM A DAY,"It's time to give it up. And we don't mean Arsenio Hall style. Quit. Go home. Keep your ball. If this is The Best American Poetry...your neighborhood Sinclair Station...the one with the 2 bay service garage...is an International Oil Cartel. I doubt that even the ""old school"" poetry fops..(the ones Harold Bloom has been kissing all these years)...I doubt they're even buying this tired, limp, biscuit anymore. If the ""cut rate"" price or 2-for-1 sale doesn't sell 'em...save it for the parrots."
4,old school music,Music from my youth. Lots of old favorites. quality of sound is good on this remastered copy which seems to clean up the bass.
5,Music CD,I've always enjoyed the music from this movie and decided to buy the soundtrack without buying all of the cd's of the individual artists.
5,wonderful product,Absolutely recommend this griddle. Previously had one and it lasted 8 years!! This newer model is even better!!Worth every penny.Extremely easy to clean.
1,Presto 07039 Jumbo Grill,I gave this as a Christmas gift to my daughter. She later told me that the product was defective.
4,Pancakes at will,Finally the cook can eat her pancakes while they are still warm. Works great and cleans up easily
3,"Works well, but construction is worrisome","This appliance is what I expected, though now that I have it, I wish its construction were a little more robust. It heats up easily hot enough for hash browns and pancakes, and quickly too. What's coming in the near future, however, is the handles breaking. They're made of a very easily broken Bakelite(tm) type material, as is the little drawer underneath. The latter broke as soon as I dropped it. The way the handles are attached and the thickness of their construction will make them the first to go after which the unit will be unusable. Take extreme caution in how it's stored, don't let the handles get too hot, be careful washing the unit, etc. But, for the price, it works very well and I'll bet all the other griddles suffer from this sort of under-construction as well. I once had a griddle so well constructed that the non-stick surface and the heating element went long before the handles were in danger."
2,It was a little disappointing.,"We had a Cooks brand griddle that we had purchased for almost nothing. It worked very well for many years, but finally the finish became worn, so it needed to be replaced. We purchased this one. The first negative thing was that the little grease tray fell out (it does not have stops to keep this from happening) and broke the corner off. Then whenever we went to use it, the balance was off a bit and it was wobbly. It did, however, warm up evenly and the food was cooked evenly as well. The handles seem to be made of the same material as the grease tray, so I hope it holds. It does hold a lot, which is the main reason we chose this one."
3,Does the job well.,"What can I say? A basic griddle which, so far, has done an excellent job. The only problem with this product is that you have to attach the handles when you get it. No big deal except one of the screws stripped immediately. Now it will only go in half way and one handle is a little loose but it does not effect it's performance so far."
3,Is nothing made in USA anymore,What a piece of junk. It looks like the old Presto griddle but weighs half as much. It is so flimsy I don't expect it to do a good job of heating evenly. Made in China..isn't that a surprise. I should have returned it as I have a feeling I just threw my money away.
4,kitchen appliance,External packaging arrived mangled and very oversized. Griddle box inside was smashed slightly but all parts ok and working.
2,i'm returning my griddle!,"I owned a Presto griddle for 10 years before it started wearing out. I wanted to replace it with another Presto. Like others have said, this one cooks very unevenly. It gives me striped pancakes and sandwiches. It also gets way too hot when you set it on the recommended temperatures. After a couple months of getting frustrated I'm finally exchanging it. Looking at other reviews, i doubt i'll get another Presto griddle. I don't know how some people are happy with theirs, then some seem defective. Wish it were more consistant."
1,Inaccurate heat disbursement,Some men are good at what they do at work. Others are good sportsguys. And others are good lovers. I fancy myself as a mean pancake cook.Oohh boy can I flip a tasty flapjack. So I wanted to move away from the standard pan frying and got my self this griddle.BIG MISTAKE. I have tried it over and over theses few months. It has uneven surface heat distribution. And I used a heat thermometer only to find it doses not get as hot as the dial set temp. Result is my pancakes are not to perfection.Maybe some of the other presto products are ok. Not this one. Back to the frying pan. I'll try makin some bacon.
4,Husband loves griddle,This was a gift for my husband for his birthday. He loves to cook and I now get week-end breakfast straight from this griddle. It works great!
2,Not so hot,"Not so big or very handy. Does NOT tilt to drain and a pain to clean. Overall not recommended, should have kept old grill."
2,Uneven heating,I purchased this item as a result of the positive ratings on this product. I was very disappointed in the quality in that the cooking surface is very thin and the heating element is a single loop that is attached to the bottom of the surface. This causes the heat to be concentrated primarily in the area of the heating element which results in extremely uneven heating on the cooking surface. I allowed the unit to preheat and when I cooked pancakes there was a dark streak in the area where they were over the heating element. I would not recommend this product.
3,An okay griddle,I got this griddle for christmas a while ago and its nice but the legs and handles brake easily if your not careful. I am looking for a new one but I am wanting one with thicker legs and handles. But I really do like this griddle just thought people would like to know about the legs and handles.
5,Nice size griddle for a large crowd,"This is a nice sized griddle, well suited for large groups. It is used when preparing breakfast items (pancakes, eggs, etc.) to feed 8 hungry guys. Cleanup is easy, as it is totally submersible with the exception of the removable temperature control.My only complaint is the material the grease cup, handles and legs are made of. The cup was dropped and chipped easily, so we're being extremely gentle when handling the griddle while washing, etc."
1,"Too thin, too irratic, too innaccurate","I purchased this griddle to replace one that I had used every weekend for 5 years. This was the highest rated model on amazon so I got it. Right off the bat I knew this was not going to go well. The temperature range was was off (250 degrees on the dial got me over 350 on the surface of the griddle). Additionally the material of the griddle is too thin. Every pancake I made was overdone in the center and underdone on the edges. Also you could see that the overdone parts were right over the element creating a nice 1"" stripe on each pancake. I tried making it work over the several months but it's time to try a new one. :("
4,Presto griddle,This is a great size for those family breakfasts. Five six inch pancakes at a time allows quick turn around of hungry children and grand children. The only draw back: the temperature does not get as high as the old Sunbeam it replaced so cooking time is longer. Clean up is a breeze and surface temperature seems to be even across the cooking topPresto 07039 Professional 22-Inch Jumbo Electric Griddle
2,Presto 07039 Professional 22-Inch Jumbo Electric Griddle,"These new one's sure are not like the older one. It's ok for me I'm in no hurry to eat half the time anyway. Takes forever to heat up, my old one was cooking on 200, this one is like warm temp at 200. It's not made out of the stuff like the older one. I kept my old one around to use if I get tired of this one."
4,Jumbo Presto Professional Electric Griddle 22-Inch,What a great find. It is so much easier to have a griddle where you can make double the pancakes of a standard griddle at one time.It cooks evenly and it is well made. I am very pleased with this purchase and would urge others to buy the same. Everybody can now have pancakes at the same time as the rest of the family and not have to wait.
5,works great,"I have had great success with our griddle. Eggs, toast, pancakes, the works. It is a bit big and bulky to store, but I love the big size for cooking for my family. Ours seems to heat evenly so far, time will tell if the other reviews prove out. Very happy customer!"
5,As nice as expected.,"So many times you buy a product and find several things that don't fit the hype for it. This time is not one of them. This griddle is indeed a great product that fulfills all its promises. This is the first time I have not had to run two seperate batches of pancakes, eggs, grilled bologna, or hamburgers for my family of 5 in order to have the entire meal ready at the same time for everyone. The space of the griddle is great. Another fantastic feature is the clean-up. A soapy washcloth followed by a damp paper towel and then dry paper towel is more than enough to clean this unit lickety-split. I have arthritis so I particularly appreciate this feature that doesn't require scrubbing. It's true that there are hotter spots in certain places due to the heating coil, but it is no problem moving the food around a bit during the cooking process to keep the heat even. 4 1/2 stars for this welcome cooking implement for our home."
1,UNEVEN HEATING & UNEVEN HEAT RANGE,WE HAD AN OLDER PRESTO WE REPLACED THAT WORKED GREAT. THIS ONE HEATS VERY UNEVENLY AND TRYING TO GET A HEAT SEETING THAT WILL NOT EITHER UNDERCOOK OR BURN PANCAKES IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE. VERY DISSAPOINTED.
5,angel unaware,I read this book when I was in junior high (1974-76). The beautiful story stayed with me and inspired me to work with children with special needs. I purchased a copy that I found in an antique store several years ago and read it again. That book is one of my most treasured. It is a timeless and beautiful book appropriate for all ages.
5,"A must-read for anyone who has a disabled child, or has lost a child","An understanding soul gave this book to my mother shortly after the birth of my youngest brother, who has Down Syndrome. This book is wonderful. It so beautifully written from the POV of little Robin giving an account to God of her brief life on earth. If there is a disabled child that has touched your life, you need to read this book. Dale Evans Rogers has written a masterpiece which will benefit the lives of many. Thank goodness God sent Robin into their lives!"
5,Excellent,"$3.50 with free shipping is a great deal for this collection of the bull moose's essays and addresses - but if I were to buy it again, I'd seek out a nice hardcover version, or even a collectible historic copy. This is the type of book you'll want to chew on and refer back to again, and this cheap paperback version with relatively small/crammed print might not hold up as well or properly convey the nobility of its contents.As I read the book, I kept thinking ""there is nothing new under the sun"". I can't say I agree with everything he says, but I can't help but deeply respect the man. It is definitely worth reading and thinking about how far we have/haven't come in 110 years."
2,you don't need it,"All you need to do is get some foam, cut a small rectangle that will fit like a bracelet around the handlebar of your bike, and put your garmin forerunner on the bike as you would your arm, over the foam. works great, much cheaper."
3,Do You Really Need This?,"The Forerunner can be wore on your waist like a watch. Before you spend good money on a bike mount, ask yourself what advantage does it offer you to take your Forerunner off from your wrist and attach it to your bike handle bar."
3,A great addition,"If yu ride, as well as run, this is a great addition. Easy to mount and use. Get a whole new use for your Garmin. No need for a dedicated bike computer. Nice to mount on the bars so you can see while you ride."
5,Killer Soca by Arrow!,"This is a killer Soca album by Arrow.Arrow is the original artist who recordedthe hit, Hot,Hot,Hot before Buster Poindexter.This is a great rockin Soca CD. Too bad it's outof print. I got a good deal on a used copy on CD.I had it on cassette when it was released.Find it and get a copy. You will party down."
3,Whom do you love?,"This is a charming, cozy book, marred only by its repetition of bad grammar. The author and publishers (what are editors for?) have missed an opportunity to fix the correct form in the minds of children and parents everywhere, and to have it associated with a smiling, shared secret pleasure. No rhyme or rhythm would have been destroyed by saying ""Whom do you love?"" instead of ""Who do you love?"" Quite the contrary, in fact: the m of whom lends a certain delicious quality to the question. If you are reading to a non-reader, and can substitute whom for who without detection, this is recommended bedtime reading; if not, skip it."
3,Well acted but?...,"This movie was well acted by Portia De Rossi, Kristoffer Polaha and Jacqueline Bisset but it was not in-depth enough. If you like exceptional acting and want to know about the basics of J.F.K Jr.'s life: then this movie is for you! My biggest gripe about this movie is that the perspective commentary of the two women at the makeshift memorial was just useless and irritating dialogue; that seemed to only be in the movie to bash the women that were in J.F.K Jr.'s life. At times it was slow with the storyline; which in turn made it boring."
3,Tsubo needs to update sizing...,"I've written before that the problem with these shoes isn't their quality, or comfort, but due to lack of 1/2 sizes, they are not a good buy."
3,Not a porn movie,"Though you'll find some naked beautiful women here, this DVD is NOT a cheap porn film. It's hard to tell how good this film in words. You have to see it: A good mixed composition of nudity and (a litle) art."
3,Heike tale shortchanged,"I am a Japanophile and history buff, so I loved this author's ""Musashi"" and ""Taiko"" novels. I finally got around to this and am quite disappointed. I agree with those who have found this translation weak---the dialogue sections are stilted and the feelings of the characters seem awkwardly expressed in English. The worst damage to the novel is the abridgement of entire sections, deletion of characters and incidents and the condensation of some chapters. As noted at the end of the ""Historical background"" section, this is an ""English version"" of the novel!Eiji Yoshikawa is definitely ill served by this version and the publisher should seriously consider having a new translation made. As it stands, this version does not even cover the fall of the Heike---which is the main point of the whole chronicle.Still, Yoshikawa weaves a good tale---he gives a human face to historical events. What delights have English readers been deprived of by this badly mangled version?"
5,Wonderful!,"I first read this book over 30 years ago and have read it several times again. It is a beautiful story and the translation gives it all the justice it deserves. I don't understand the problem the previous reader had with it. It is highly accessible (unlike the translation of Tale of Genji that I read years ago) and requires no special knowledge of Japanese geography, history, etc. I recommend it highly. (FYI, I too have lived in Japan and traveled extensively throughout the country. My Japanese isn't good enough to read it in the original.)"
3,Heike monogatari,"This is not a translation of the mediaeval classic of the same name, but a modern novel based on its core events, namely the rise to power and fall of Taira Kiyomori and his clan, also known as the Heike."
1,A powerful story marred by a poor translator.,"I live in Kyoto, Japan and I speak a fair amount of Japanese and EVEN I am having trouble following this book.The original Japanese version assumed that the reader would be familiar with the geography, society and politics of Kyoto. The translator simply translated the sotry without filling the English-speaking reader in.Without a great deal of familiarity with Japanese history, names, language and politics a reader will not follow this book."
2,no no for coffee mugs......,Strictly recommended for cups of smallest size available...i guess 12 expresso cups will fit..... hooks are spaced so close about 6 average size cups will fit not 12... about mugs hmmmmm 1 or 2 may b only if holder of mug is thin and sleek.
1,No!,"If you use very small cups, this is for you. If like most people you use average size mugs and cups, you can get maybe 4 or 5 on the rack, not worth the money."
4,GOOD LIVE ALBUM,"A Greatest Hits Live clocking in at a meagre 42'. It does leave you wishing for more but in 1984 vinyl albums run for about 40',the max aloowed time for keeping the sound good. The performance is inspired as Gregory and the band unfold their trademark mellow sound but I had to crank the sub a lot to feel the pulse of the rhythm section because the recording was wire-thin (which is weird on a reggae record BTW). I have older reggae vinyls (3d World) with MASSIVE amounts of bass on it; whatever ! Other than that the mix is crystal-clear although a bit distant.I could really have used some bonus tracks; there are a lot of other live recordings from this great jamaican reggae musician so no excuses there. Bar those two complaints, the cd is a joy to listen and keep in your collection."
3,A Messy Ending,"I enjoyed the story up until the very end - the description of the Centennial was very well done; you felt that you were there. However, I like a twisted ending as well as anyone, but this was a mess! One too many U-turns, in my opinion. Otherwise, a clear, descriptive story with good character development."
3,"Vivid picture of 1876 Phila, so-so mystery","I was really looking forward to reading this novel, the images of the Centennial fair in 1876 Philadelphia are very vivid, you can almost see all of the described sights. I was very disappointed in the mystery however. It all seemed too convoluted and confusing. The protagonist McCleary didn't impress me all that much. Everyone and their brother seems to be able to fool him. Not a great trait in a detective. However, the author is excellent in bringing back the atmosphere of the 1870's."
3,"akim tamiroff, king of gamblers",while the photo is a good one the referential identifiers leave too much to be desired.
5,Simply The Best,"Celeberity album is very difrent from nsync's other albums. It has a retro fell to it that's great to dance to. Some of the songs are somewhat alike in the beat but preety much all the songs are original. It is really a great album and every big nsync fan should get a copy of this album. Some people have said the album isn't as good as the second one but i beg to differ. I actually liked this one more than the second album so go get the album. ""This I promise you"" the album is great!"
1,What is the music industry thinking?,"NSYNC might have put themselves together as a group, but who put this album together? What a waste of money. It goes to show that not all good things come true. ... All the hype that this album received turned out to be embarassing. The only interesting song on this CD is ""POP."" Justin and JC might have co-wrote the songs, but they better be prepared to find another career. Singing isn't their forte. And why isn't Chris, Lance, and Joey involved in the singing? I'm getting tired of hearing Justin and JC. It may be too late now, but people reading this please be aware that ""Celebrity"" is all about it's title. A no-brainer!"
1,Not the same,I really Really liked the Nsync and Nsync No strings attached but I heard this CD and its BAd I would say People who liked the old Nsync songs but they don't like Rap music just lison to the two old ones but If you like Rap music you may like it
2,"Same old, same old.","After listening to the CD, I couldn't tell if there was one song or 12. Everyone sounded just like the last one. The guys really need to get their stuff together and hopefully come up with a better variety of songs with their next album."
3,NSync or No Thanks,"I think that there last albums were better but the beats on this one are something to move to. Jc and Justin are the vocal magic behind NSync, but what about the others do they not get any lyrical time. But over all the album only has about 2 or 3 songs that are good. Buy it if your an NSync fan, but if your not save your money."
1,Disappointing,"I started out hating Nsync then they grew on me and I liked them. But now I'm quickly losing interest in them again. The first single off this album, ""Pop"", is a really bad song with a bad video. Their problem is they don't know what they want. They don't know if they want to be original and do something different from everyone else or to be the same old teenybopper group that they started out as. I will defend them and say that people can't say they don't play instruments. Their instruments are their voices and they do have fine voices. I just feel they aren't putting them to good use on this album. Sadly, I didn't enjoy it."
2,"It is so over-produced, where is the talent?","This album could make me sound good and I can't carry a tune in a bucket. Of course, this is the big one for N*SYNC, can they top their previous record in sales with ""Celebrity""? Or, is this the beginning of the end of the boy-band bravada. This album sounds good...that is just it, it sounds too good. With such obvious studio ""sweentening"" and blatant over-production, you have to wonder if this aging group is trying to prove they know how to hire someone who can run a sound board, or is this the talentless package we have always feared so out of tricks that they release an album that is so contrived as to mock the vary aspects of the business they feed on? Another disc full of nondescript pop drivel. Hey, anyone remember New Kids third album? Exactly."
1,Tasteless music,"This cd has not artistic value, lacking decency and melody. This kind of music literally gives me headache, and then if plays a little longer, I will fall to sleep"
5,~!*!~DirtyPop~!*!~,"I luv this cd!!!!!! It's sooooo kewl!!!! track #2 ""Celebrity"" is kinda weird and track #8 ""Up Against The Wall"" is kinda weird and track #3 ""The Game Is Over"" is awesome!!!! and, of course, track #1 ""Pop"" is awesome!!! Rock On *NSYNC!!!!!!!""Do you ever wonder why this music gets you high, it takes you on a ride, feel it when your body starts to rock, the beat you can't stop, and the music's all you got, this must be *POP*.."""
5,Nsync's Celebrity,"First off, this was an amazing way to follow No String's Attached(the bands previous album). They have gracefully grown and changed with their music. With both ballads and dance tracks on this album they, as always, have something for everyone. The ballads are prettier than ever, with some having a blues feeling to them. While the dance tracks definatly follow the 'dirty pop' sound as they provide amazing songs to hit the dance floor with. Another plus to this album is that they have written and/or co-produced all the tracks, seperating them from the 'boy band' category. They have gone through a dramatic and excellent change since their debut album which only leaves us with one thing to beleive they're no longer 'cookie-cutter pop'. Its 'dirty pop' and its here to stay."
1,Not Impressed a Bit.....,"As an NSYNC fan, I was gravely disappointed. It's just a cd of club music. With the exception of ""Pop"" and ""Gone"", there's nothing impressive or outstanding here. As usual, Justin and JC sing all the lead vocals and put the rest of the guys on the backburner. Justin and JC wrote 95% of the songs on the cd, maybe that's why it (stinks) so much. Chris Kirkpatrick's song he wrote and sang himself called ""Fallen"" was cut off the album at the last minute because it wasn't written or sung by the ""cute ones"". Chris, Joey, and Lance: I feel so bad for you guys taking this (....) NSYNC, I still love you guys but you could've done better."
2,Not even close,"This new album had me very excited, waiting for it's release. A die-hard *NSYNC fan, I had high expectations from the Celebrity album, but when I bought it, I was pretty disappointed. It wasn't even close to my expectations. The lyrics were good, and the guys did a good job writing the songs, but most of the songs sounded the same to me. I think I liked maybe four of the songs. So I would suggest listening to someone else's before you buy this CD."
2,What Happened To NSYNC?,"Okay, I have been a fan of NSYNC from day one and I have always loved their changes. When No Strings Attached came out, I was into the techno sounds like in ""Digital Getdown"" and ""No Strings Attached"" but I was also extremely pleased with the Poppy songs like ""Bye Bye Bye"" and of course the slow songs like ""This I Promise You"". But this new CD is too R&B'ish for my taste. I mean, all of the songs sound the same and most of the time, their voices are using that wierd enhancing thing that makes the song sound like techno. I love ""POP"" and being an NSYNC fan, I had to buy this CD. Afterall, I have all of them. I can honesty say that I am not at all pleased with it. I respect their change, but I think they can do much better."
2,"They're growing up, folks.......","'N Sync, a boy band that is indeed growing up, deserve credit for writing and producing most of the songs on this CD, but it's all a sign of growing up. These kids aren't babies anymore, they're growing up, yet their music sounds the same as it has always been. I guess this CD has sold more than their #!)@(&$% No Strings Attached ever did in its first week. I give them credit for that but this type of music isn't enough for me. I'm not the type who buys a CD just because they're so ""hot"" or ""cute"". I don't even listen to this type of music at all. My sister has gotten so sick of them that she calls them .... I've recently noticed she's jumping on the alternative/rock train, just like certain teens in America have been doing lately. I'm sure you'll know that there's plenty more out there than this. Later."
4,It's... different,"definitly not what u'd expect from nsync! i thought there would be slow love songs like on the first and second, but no, on this on they're revvin' it up with R&B and they're doin' great! It takes a few listenings to get used to the difference, but after a bit, it seems alright. My ABSOLUTE favorite is ""The Game is Over"" and the second favorite is ""Pop"" U really gotta hear the whole song because the sample they give isn't enough! I highly recommend this for any nsync fan."
2,At least they ARE establishing themselves more,"Unlike the stuff from the previous albums, *Nsync have actually written some songs from this album, and that gives them one step ahead of the other albums. Also, the production isn't really that bad. Still, there are songs that are pointless, like the singles ""Girlfriend"" and ""Pop"" (Justin co-wrote it, but still it's self-absorbed, no offense fans).I heard NSA and hated it, but this has some good songs, like ""The Game is Over"" and ""The Two of Us"", and the band are kind of showing that they aren't quite as manufactured as it seemed. But don't get me wrong, I still don't like their music that much. I still think that it gets tiresome sometimes, but if you want a CD from them, get this one."
3,"Fame, fortune, conceit?","I've never actually owned an 'N Sync album until this. Now, even though I think boy bands are terribly overrated, 'N Sync seems to stand out from the rest of them, because they have, well, good vocals to complement the music. There are different themes that play throughout this album, but the main themes are fame, fortune, conceit, love, and relationships gone sour. Pretty, uneven, but it works as long as the music is hot. The best choices here are ""Pop,"" ""Celebrity,"" ""Girlfriend,"" ""Gone,"" and ""Selfish."" As for the rest of the album, I think it has its fair share of filler, but even the filler isn't that bad. I'd recommend this album only to 'N Sync fans, I don't think this will appeal to non-'N Sync fans."
5,Brave New Venture,The guys have changed up their sound and I can't help but like them even more. Attempting to break out of the teenybopper arena is a daring thing and hopefully they'll succeed. This album is a step in that direction.
1,IT was a let down,"N'SYNC is a great boy band but with this album it seems like the took a stop down from their hit cd ""No Strings Attached."" None of their songs are ""Hit"" materials. They do not have a catchy beat or a line that sticks in your head. All of their songs sound like spin offs from other hits. They should've used expierenced song writers because this cd stinks."
1,N'Sync Should've listened to Black and Blue...,"N'Sync tried to do something they couldn't pull off with this album. I tried to listen to the album all the way through but the lyrics and some of the beats were terrible. The only songs I could stomach were ""Pop"", ""Gone"", and ""Girlfriend."" Songs like ""Celebrity"", and ""Up against a Wall"" just had some of the worst lyics or the wrong beats to put them to...."
5,New and different - LOVE IT!,"This CD is a great example of why I love *NSYNC -- every CD they release is totally new and completely different from the one before it. Don't buy Celebrity expecting an encore of No Strings Attached -- expect something even BETTER. *NSYNC takes their sound to entirely new levels with this unique and awesome album. It has a perfect blend of beautiful ballads and punchy, upbeat, in-your-face dance songs, sure to please ANYBODY. This isn't bubblegum pop by any stretch of the imagination!!"
2,(Not what I expected),"N Sync, No Strings Attached, and now Celebrity. I am really dissapointed at the kind of quality of music N Sync has produced this time. N Sync is known for their Pop style music, and it has worked for them so far. Now they completely changed their way of singing. I'm so dissapointed that I'm reselling their new Celebrity album, I can't take it anymore. I was a true fan of their music, but by changing their norm, I am truly offended. Backstreet Boys released Black and Blue sometime ago, and it continued their style of music with little or no change, I liked every song except for Shining Star, but N Sync's new album, I liked 1 out of 13 and that's POP. A mixture between R and B, Plus two step? like some say.... I'm Sorry N Sync, please if it ain't broke don't fix it, if your doing great don't change it..."
2,"hmmm, it was kinda disappointing","i was a bit disappointed that tho they changed their sound, n'sync is still mostly justin and a bit of jc. onli justin and jc sing, u can hardly hear any of the other voices and i find that very unfair. otherwise, the songs are ok, but it sounds like they're tryin to be somethin they aren't. this cd sounds like they're just tryin to follow wut's in rite now"
1,(Dot Dot Dot),"I don't even have to hear the CD to know what kind of fabricated crap is on it. It's ironic when you guys start saying that ""Their sound has matured"" when in reality they didn't even have a hand in it musically. Another Interesting Point: The lyrics in their new single ""Pop"" are quite funny, since they are obviously defending themselves fom the Anti-Nsync crowd. And, as we all know, our human nature is to defend ourselves when threatened. I mean, if a huge dog is going to rip you to shreds, you are going to try your best to defend yourself, correct? But if it's a whiny chihuahua barking at you, you wouldn't really mind. Well, the same goes with Nsync. They wouldn't have done such a defensive song if they didn't feel so threatened. They know their reign is over. This will probably be their last big album. After this, it's all downhill; they've already reached their peak. Oh and one more thing: Justin Timberlake is sooo hot! Giggle!"
5,they did it again,"Nsync's new cd ""celebrity"" was the greatest so far.All of the songs have a catchy beat and make you want to hear more.one question is:justin writes alot of the songs on this cd but many of them if not all talk about i need love , i want love, you dont show me love, and things like that, is this s sign that maybe he doesnt like Britney Spears no more and he is trying to tell her or is it just a sign to let him free? who knows for sure but them two.i liked Up Against the wall, Girlfriend,Something like you,and the rest of the album. this new cd gives you an urge you never felt before with any musician.but where do they go after being number one? ill tell always at number one. with this cd they are unstoppable.any one who reads this please help me meet justin timberlake/nsync. if justin reads this congrats and love you,or any nsync member. you guys really out done your selves. good luck"
1,HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA,"SO you like music that's completely FAKE, PACKAGED and POINTLESS? Well, this JUNK of an album here will satisfy your GAYNESS like no other album can. SO I guess I'll Just See you when you finally WAKE UP TO REALITY! (LOL)"
1,Has Beens,"I'm embarrassed to admit that I actually bought this album when it came out. After listening to this album twice, I had to sell it ASAP because it was pop music at its absolute worse. J.C. can't sing at all. He tries too hard to sound like he has soul but it's just so painlessly obvious that he has no kind of soul to begin with and his voice is strained. Justin Timberfake sings like a wench and I don't know who told him he was hot stuff because he looks like a wimpy fairy. Speaking of fairies, I guess it was no surprise when Lance came ""out."" Other than that, I'm glad that these fools are done and over with. They contributed nothing to the world of music except garbage. Justin Timberfake is still holding the torch, but not for long. Skip anything by NSYNC as if it were the plague."
1,Worst Song/CD I ever heard,N'Sync is terrible in this album. They try to be different but it just sounds messy and very poorly produced. If you like their past albums you will hate this one. The only reason N'Sync sells CDs is because people think that they are so talented which i thought they where until this album was released.
2,Celebrities or Not?????,"N*Sync came back with more ""POP,"" what a big shocker. Well as I listened to the cd I compared it with their others. And what I relized is that it sounds like ""No Strings Attached,"" their second album with some fresh beats. I listened to ""Gone"" and ""The Game is Over,"" more times than the other tracks but after a week I got tired of the whole album. I suggest go spend your $ on Britney Spear's ""Britney."" That's a cd that sounds different than her others at least. But here's reviews of the first 3 singles. Out of five *'s.""Pop"" - ***1/2""Gone"" - **12""Girlfriend"" - ***"
1,A work of art.,"Your only option is to get this album. Tears of joy will stream down your face when you listen to this masterpiece. The lyrics are rich and full of meaning that any everyday person can relate to. You will fall to your knees listening to this, and you'll thank God for letting you purchase it. Go out and buy it now, you won't regret it. The lyrics, instrumentation... everything about this album, and this band in general, is brilliant.OH! I thought I was reviewing an album from Pink Floyd! Not an album from a talentless, manufactured boyband! Avoid N*Sync like they were a plauge, and get the latest album from the Rolling Stones instead."
1,N'Crap,"N'sync have not changed at all, except in this album they attempt to sound black, wich they are not. I also do not see the point in them having more than justin and J.C. because the others only dance around in the video's. N'scync has never released a decent song, and i doubt that any human likes them for musical talent, but for their ugly brutish appearence. Sorry girls, but Justin appears to be trying to grow pubic hairs on his hear. And do you ever wonder why/ his voice is so high? They also try to show that they are talented by getting writing credits in every song. In truth, they may have only written one line, and considering that they are ALL THE SAME SONG this is no accomplishment. On the hit single 'pop' they say that they have the gift of melody, and they will be around untill the end.Yeah, right. Keep dreaming."
1,Worst of their cds.,"I am a huge *NSYNC fan, but this cd wasn't as good as their other cds. It was all electronic sounding and aren't any really strong songs. They are a good group but this is just a bad cd."
1,Horrible CD!!,"If the group, N'Sync where to take away all the computer generated sounds in their songs, and had no writers making these hit songs for them, they would be probably all be working at some small town grocery store! This CD, Celebrity, has justin singing lead in EVERY song! JC is in there a little bit, but I where the other memeber's of the group, i would leave! What kind of group are they anyways? POP? They say they are pop in that stupid song, but they are really black wanna be's!"
1,"This Album Sounds Like Others, But Much Worse","I am not a huge fan of ""Pop"" music or boy bands in general. However, I did like songs by N Sync and The Backstreet Boys, I am not one of those totally biased people who despises pop totally. This album is horrible. I cannot believe these people giving it five star reviews, they obviously do not know what music is. N Sync will be gone soon enough and so will this album. I usually love their slow songs, these songs sound the same as the old ones with worse lyrics and music. The song ""Pop"" is a joke. They say ""Ice around my neck"". As hard as they try, they will never be ""hard"" or anything near that. They become more of a joke with every album. The fast songs sound like they hit random keys on a synthesizer and just sang about stupid things to them. This album signifies the true end of N Sync."
2,definitely 2nd best,well...here comes another one. these guys kept promising something better...yet they keep delivering disappointments...their 2nd album was nothing comparing to the first...and this one has no difference...their music definitely comes after BSB's.
5,This CD is Kick @$$!!!,"Even people who formerly didn't like 'NSync love this CD. MAybe its because they've totally grown up musically speaking. When I bought this cd yesterday, I was expecting something kinda similar to their previous album, but I was totally blown away when I poped it in the cd player. Their sound is soo tight!! Every song is awesome! (Even the slow ones, and this isd coming from the girl who before wouldn't even listen to slow beats!) Be prepared for some hip-hop, a bit of dance, and even a little soul. This is by far one of the best CD's I have listened to in a long time. An instant classic!"
4,N*SYNC Matures,"This CD was definitely different than the first 2 recordings by the group. While you can still find some of the ""Old Sound"" music, they have branched out a little and matured somewhat in their music. My 9 year old daughter loves this group and at first wasn't sure if she liked the new sound but after listening to if for a while, she is really enjoying it. I, too, also find the CD enjoyable."
1,ZERO STARS!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM!!?!?!?!?!,"Ok. I will try to be as fair adn unbiased as I can. I will admit, i used to like *NSync as much as the next girl... but then they changed. They don't even sing pop music anymore! They sing latin-y, rap-y, techno-y, i-don't-even-know-what-it-is-but-it-sure-ain't-music-y stuff. The reason *NSync will fade out SOON: cuz they're original sound, true boyband pop, has died for them. That's why I listen to a real POP BAND: Dream Street."
5,A Must-Have,"hey everybody!!! i am a major nsync fan and i reccommend this CD along with their others to all pop fans. I do hafta admit that No Strings Attached was better, but Celebrity is a five star winner. Pop is a great dancing song and Gone and Selfish express the ability of Nsync's voices (especially Justin's) and Tell Me...Tell Me...Baby brings you back to the old nsync groove. hope this was helpful and pick up the CD today!!!"
2,not really a fan but some songs were alright,"Pop,Celebrity are the only songs on here that I like but their music is anything but original. Hip hop artists and legends like michael jackson have been there, done that and done it much better before and people like n sync are just trying to take what's been done successfully already by black artists to market it to teenagers who were once into country music and don't know a thing about r&b/hip hop"
4,Nsync slowly make it 2 da Big League...,"I've never been a big fan of the band but still I have to say I respect them a great lot for going out on a limb and putting their... eh... 'pretty faces' on the line with this album. Nsync matured a lot and you hear it on the songs. The perfect harmony of previous recordings is gone, now Justin and JC kind of compete by outscreaming and outgrinding each other. But it's all good. At least they broke their own image and reinvented themselves (like Madonna, Michael Jackson and company do all the time). The Max Martin-produced songs are a little too obvious and remind me of 'No Strings Attached'. But Justin and JC show they have songwriting talent and the production (by Neptunes, BT and others) is excellent! Best tracks? 'Pop', 'The Game Is Over', 'Girlfriend' and 'Gone'."
5,Something for Everyone...,"At first glance of this album, I thought 'ew'. I'm one of the people who hate the new path Pop is heading down. I liked the original stuff out of groups like *NSYNC and Backstreet Boys. But with this album, they've combined their styles. It's kind of a conglomeration of their past work. ""Something Like You"" and ""Selfish"" bring back the ballads, while ""Just Don't Tell Me That"" brings back memories of songs like ""Bye, Bye, Bye"", and still others like ""The Game is Over"" use new stuff like Arcade Sounds.All in all a good CD and a great buy."
1,What were they thinking???,I love N Sync but this is awful. They have totally changed their style and their sound. I love the softer side of N Sync. This new style will bring them down FAST!
1,how can you look yourself in the mirror if you own this,"if my kids listened to this, i would put them up for adoption."
1,Horrible,"N Sync's attempt at a more mature album failed. Their music is awful and they cannot sing, and they are also very ugly. Unless you are a fan of N Sync, don't buy this barbaric album."
3,It's not so good.,<No Strings Attached>is very good album. But this album is not. There isn't good ballad like <This I promise you>.¡ÚRemember! No good songs except 'Pop'!¡Ú
1,"NOT EVENA 1 STAR CD, MORE LIKE 0 STARS","I was a fan of *NSYNC but after No Strings Attached came out(2nd album), my views changed. I thought I would give 'em one more chance with this album, and buy it. I was WRONG, I wasted [amt] on this cd. It literally sucks, and could be the end of *NSYNC. This is a 55 minute cd and of those 55 minutes probably about 43 of them is Justin singing solo. NSYNC should now be named Justin and friends. Anyone who gave this a 5 is wrong, you are probably some nsync obsessed fan who would have given them a 5 if they sang ""la la la"" for 50 minutes. All the songs sound the same, and are all 'pop' songs. They say they wanted it to be more R&B and stuff, well it isn't! Save your money on a good cd, like O-Town, were out of 295 reviews, 185 of them are 5 stars. O-Town is a different sounding group who is worth your money not *NSYNC. This doesn't even deserve a 1, it deserves a 0."
2,Disappointing...,"After buying all three N SYNC albums and their christmas album, I think that Celebrity is the worst one. For a vocal group that has so much talent, and can harmonize so well together- they have totally abandoned their strongest asset for a techno, hip hop technique. The songs quickly begin to wear on your nerves and make you want to return to their original self-titled album which was by far their best work as a group, although there are many good tracks on No Strings Attached as well."
1,What is so big about these boy bands?,"Ok, here i was stuck at a friends house, having to listen to this ... all night!! what is so great about it?? yes they have talent but their mussic is terrible!! i cant here this ""new"" sound, its still the same old boy band ...!!!! Their music is the most terrible thing ever written, and as a musician and vocalist i would like to apploigise to the world. I would just like to un-brainwash these teenie boppers!! They make me sad to be a musician, and i wish they would just stop ruining the music industry, along with all the other boy bands who sound just like them, and all will be unknow in a few years. EVERYONE STOP WAISTING YOUR MONEY and buy some good jazz cd's or musicals like RENT!!"
4,Celebrity ranks TOPS,"When Nsync's prior two albums [NSYNC and No Strings Attached] came out I though that it would be hard to top, but guess again they did it! They have managed to make me memorize every song in full detail. My favorite song would have to be ""Girlfriend"" because I wish I was JC Chasez girlfriend. The music on this album does not have the same straight ""POP"" sound that they are labeled as. It has a more relaxed mix between the infamus ""POP"" and R&B. They have grown up soo much in the past two albums and people have said that they would come and go but it looks like to me NSYNC is here to stay, for sure. So if your thinking about giving ""boy bands"" a chance try NSYNC's Celebrity."
5,i love it!,"this album is the bomb! it's perfect to dance to and just plan on have a fun time! get this album you'll love it!i love everysong on this album. everything from ""pop"" to ""selfish"" i love it all!"
4,Surprise,"I was surprised when i went out and got this today. I walked into a record store and heard songs 5-11 and had to get it. I wasn't really a huge fan of theirs... I liked most of their hits but, this is a good cd.The haunting chorus of ""Gone"" is a nice hard to say goodbye song. ""Pop"" which everyone knows, spent a few weeks on BET's 106 and Park. They also have a Neptune(makers of Kelis,JAY-Z etc. songs) produced a song called ""Girlfriend"" something for the r&b crowd. People, all races don't sell yourself short by not getting this for fear of teasing because you own a so-called ""Boyband"" cd. This cd has something for everyone black/ white, young/old.... Get this you'll be surprised...."
5,Intense,"I think that this album can be summed up in one word: Intense. Its a great album. I think Nsync realizes that the sound of the music world is changing, and they're changing along with it, but unlike many other acts, they're taking their fans with them. You can still hear the vocals of the group, and the harmonies are still there to be heard with sounds of two-step and electronica in the backround. The men of Nsync have definitly changed since their self titled debut album- but its a change for the better. Some people are looking for a follow up to their sophomore album No Strings Attached, but this isnt it. This is a whole new sound for them, but it completely works for the better. I, personally, love the song Gone(written by justin timberlake and wade robinson) and The Two Of Us. In Gone Justins voice is perfectly pitched and has a soulful blue-sy sound to it. and in The Two Of Us, the groups harmonies are perfectly set. I think this album will be another record-breaker."
2,Total dissapointment,"Don't get me wrong, i love N Sync's music, ""No Strings Attached"" was a really good cd before all of the radio stations ran it into the ground. Maybe it was good because they spent some actual time on it. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to my knowledge, they were on tour and made this album in less than 6 months. Some of the best songs were written in 10 minutes, but i really doubt it took 10 minutes to produce them. Overall, I'd say that the cd would be much better if they had spent some more time on it."
3,Not as good...,"I have to admit that I am a little disappointed with this album, I preferred 'No Strings Attached'. I love *NSYNC for their catchy dance tunes, but this cd seemed to have more sappy love songs or at least songs with less of a beat. I hope that the next album is more upbeat."
3,These guys are N'sync-able?!?,"A cry for help from N'Sync. Is anyone out there to answer? They start off fast paced on this album, and then....they continue doing so. Good work. Or is it? Guess you'll have to buy it and find out. Can you imagine being in your grave, and thinking to yourself ""Why didn't I listen to that N'Sync's Celebrity when I had the chance? Why am I a zombie, doomed to live in this catacomb? Damn you world!""..."
5,The best CD yet!,This is an absolute great CD! No matter what it costs everyone should get it. It has songs that everyone can relate to! The ballads are smooth and sweet and every fast-paced song on the album you can dance to! It is a GREAT CD and I would recommend that everyone get this CD right away!
4,*N Sync: All Grown Up?,"In the land of boy bands and pop music, *N Sync is red hot. And with their new cd, ""Celebrity,"" they show no signs of stopping. I have respect for all types of music, but I am not a paticular fan of pop. But I was shocked and amazed on hearing ""Celebrity"". This cd ranges from pop to R&B to hip-hop to borderline techno. These guys have a new found attitude - this cd is wonderfully lacking the lovesick whiny ballads, in exchange for rhythm and blues. And with Justin and JC writing 10 out of the 13 tracks on the CD, I have found an all new respect for these boys. I recommend this cd to those who love pop, and even to those who hate it. You may just change your mind."
4,_w*O*w~,"I'm a rocker. I am one of those anit-boy band kind of girls, and find nearly 100% of the pop out there right now purely [bad]. But this album is truly different, and blew me away when I heard how different the sound was. I love the electronica sounds and the fact that they write their own songs. Oh, and Pop is so catchy, I almost feel ashamed to like it! These boys know what's up, and they will be around for a while. And for all of you other rockas out there.. don't be ashamed to like something different and immediately put this on your ... list, it has a good sound and might surprise you."
1,Pure ....,Why are evil albums like this popular? It is the product of a runaway capatilist recording industry bent on getting out a controlable ware to the preteen market.
5,Nothing Better,"'Celebrity' is a great cd. The music is diverse and shows their growth as artists. In my opinion, the songs JC has written are superior to Wade's and Justin's, but that is also what is unique about NSYNC. Lance has the business set up, Justin is vocally strong, JC shines in the studio, Chris and Joey keep things lively. Nsync is vocally better than any of the male pop bands, no one can sing accapella like they can, and also that is why all of their collaborations have been so highly acclaimed. My favorite song on the album is Gone. Justin puts his heart and soul into the bluesy-jazz tinged song every time he performs it. The only problem I have with the album is Max Martin's song Tell Me, Tell Me...Baby. The song borrows heavily from the Backstreet Boys The Call, which Martin also wrote. For that reason I think Nsync chose to write most of their own songs. Nsync did an exemplarary job creating this cd almost all on their own."
1,Awful,"NSYNC has really backed themselves into a corner this time. Their fans are going to be dropping like the proverbial flies after the release of this album. I came up with a name for this supposed new sound of theirs---CRAP. I dont know why anybody would even buy the CD (I heard the CD through MP3s by the way). NSYNC really got off on the wrong foot with their least successful single ever ""Pop""--or what I like to refer to as ""Flop"" due to the fact NOBODY likes this song..not even hardcore fans. In conclusion this CD is crap--but be happy...because fans can only buy crap albums from a band for so long until they give up. I think NSYNC is about to become EXTINCT after this Dirty Flop."
3,"its ok, only 3 good songs","most of the songs are pathetic except 4 pop, girlfriend, and tell me, tell me baby. those are good"
4,"Great CD From My Favorite ""Boy Band""","Normally I don't bother to write a review but after reading the two negative reviews I felt I had to give my two cents. This cd sounds nothing like No Strings Attached, in fact if I didn't know anything about *NSYNC I wouldn't even guess they were a boy band. I enjoyed all the songs greatly and have been listening to this cd non stop since I got on my birthday. And I'm sure you are wondering what age I passed on my birthday that I would be excited about an *NSYNC cd, well I turned 22, past my kiddie phase. I loved this cd so much I would like to give it 5 stars expect I sometimes skip the first 3 songs. ""Pop"" I hear all the time on the radio so I have no desire to listen to it when I don't have to. ""Celebrity"" is extremly silly and ""The Game is Over"" is also silly with the dumb pac-man music in the background. Yet, I like all the other songs on the cd."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT!...BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I rushed out the day *N SYNC: CELEBRITY came out because I am huge fan of *N SYNC. I felt that too many of the songs sounded alike. I feel that this cd doesn't have enough variety as 'NO STRINGS ATTACHED' had. I know how many people rushed to get this cd and too many of them decided how much of a disappointment it was. I'd borrow it from somebody before I bought it. Some people said its more mature, but I felt that they needed some variety and not the same song types over and over.SORRY *N SYNC....but you can do better!"
1,omg!,"no no no, i just don't like it, i recieved this for my birthday last month and i was frustrated with my in laws because for one, this cd is quite old. 2nd, this cd is hideous, besides the catchy ""pop"" the whole cd fails to strike a nerve with any of my senses. I recomend just buying something recent or artistically endeavouring, not childish and ridiculous"
1,NSYNC?,"i would not recomend NSYNC to anyone. they are just another backstreet boys wanna be. I do not think they have the required talent to be labelled as a good group. They are just another gurlie soundign wanna be boy band. They blow and they shouldnt be considered talent! they sound like whiney 14 year old gurlz, they have no talent what so ever! I do not like them at all! and Alyx Miller is not hot! she is very ugly, on the otherhand, Andrew Cleaveley (A.K.A. Cleaver) is the cutie! so Andy, i don't think u win, i believe i do!"
1,Just stick to your usual!,"I am a true fanatic of *NSYNC, having their CD's and such. I was truly dissapointed with their new CD celebrity. I guess I'm just not a person that can easily adjust to change, since ""Celebrity"" was utterly different from their other two CD's. It sounds more like rap than pop, plus in the song ""Pop"" I don't exactly like Justin repeatedly saying ""Dirty Pop""I think *NSYNC could have done better with this CD if they had just stayed with their regular kind of sounding music and lyrics, instead of trying to do something so different I'm not sure I'm listening to *NSYNC anymore."
4,Good CD(but Justin should stop trying to be Prince!),"The album was great. The best cut is ""Gone"" with ""The Game is Over"" in a close second. But why does Justin Timberlake think he is Prince. In some songs he tries to pattern his sound big time with the other guys hanging on for the ride and speaking of that when is the rest of NSYNC gonna come to the front. They talk about together well why do Justin and J.C. overpower everyone elses voice. That's a shame I believe the other guys probably have great voices too! Well thats all I have to say."
1,What's So New About It?,"So I took a listen, everyone was going on about Nsync's ""new"" sound. What I found were over produced tracks and 5 white boys trying hard to be black. Justin, Michael Jackson you are not. His vocals are so whiny and I swear Justin's voice was the only voice I heard singing on this CD. Okay, one in awhile they let JC sing too but I'm sure only after Justin approved it. I thought there were 5 members in this group?If you want true R&B music with beautiful harmony pick up a Boyz 2 Men CD, that's real music."
1,It Was The Worst CD Ever!!!,Now I WAS a die-hard nsync fan. Until I heard this CD. It has no creativity. None at all. I loved the song pop and that was the only good one. They have not matured at all they sound exactly alike their last CD. I would not recommed this CD to anyone. I was a total waste of time and money. They put out the CD just so they could break their old record you can really tell they spent no time at all on this CD. Thanx for reading.
1,It is trash!,"I used to be an *N Sync fan back in the day, not a fanatic but just a fan of their music. Once this CD came out I thought about possibly buying it til I heard most of it at a record store and I was ashamed to have liked their music. The song ""Pop"" isn't even that good, but needless to say that was their only good song on that CD. It is best to just save your money. Justin is doing better without the guys."
1,Speed Metal? WTF,"Serioulsly, that Limp Bizkit Fan is on crack. I mean that punk does'nt even know what speed metal is, even if it hit him upside his head. N'sync is not and I repeat NOT SPEED METAL, they're nothin but pathetic MTV/pop garbage along with Limp Crapface, Drunkstreet Dorks, and Puke Mouth. I'm f**kin glad they're history. If you want real speed metal, listen to Slayer, Anthrax, Sepultura, Metallica, Kreator, Megadeth, Testament, Overkill, Arch Enemy, Iced Earth, Exodus, and Possessed.One last word to Limp Bizkit Fan:GET A LIFE MOTHERF**KER!!"
2,Majorly dissapointing,"This cd was very dissapointing. I excpected a new sound for n'sync. Maybe some more R&B; less OOH BABY more good music. I only liked a few songs. Most of them were ballads (which I am not a huge fan of.) The other boys need to step up front and sing a little more. JC and Justin do most of the singing. I barely ever hear any of Lance, Joey or Chris. I understand JC and Justin are the lead singers, but this is just my opinion. All of the songs are the same as the last cd! Recommended favorites are. . . .Tell Me, Tell Me. . .BabyGirlfriendDo your thingInstead I recommend Justified by Justin Timberlake."
3,Not the Best,"N'sync has let me down with this CD. Some of the songs are ok, but most of them sound like ""No Stings Attached""'s ""Digital Get Down"". This has the corny slow songs on it too."
3,Is there a such thing as too pop?,"This CD proves that 'NSync is proud to be a pop band. The problem is, I think they went a little bit too pop. I own all of the 'NSync CDS, and this one is definitely alot different from the others. It's still really good, but just not as good. If you're a fan of Justin Timberlake, you should probably get this, because he sings most of the songs. Well, JC too. In fact, I think the other guys just sang the background vocals...Hmm. Oh well. My point is, I wasn't really thrilled with ""Celebrity"" because I'm a fan of their older music. However, it's still good and I would recommend it to pop fans!!"
4,Surprisely good,"When my friend gave me this album to listen to I was expecting to hate it since I hate NSync but I have to admit it was good. Something Like You is a really beautiful song and Girlfriend and Up Against a Wall have very catchy lyrics. The only songs I didn't like was Pop and Celebrity, I found them very rude. I think NSync singing songs with real meanings instead of bubble gum fluff was orginial for Boy bands but they went a little to far. If they wanted to get their points across about the entertaiment business and the downfalls of it they should have done a song about them not being in competetion with the Backstreet Boys and that it is possible to like both bands music or respecting Celebs choices in who they want to date ...instead insulting NSync haters who have the right to their opinions (with the expection of personal insults against NSync fans) and suggesting their girlfriends might only be with them because of their fame and money."
5,slammin',I am a huge fan of nsync. i love this cd so much im going to get it. thanks guys. keep up the good work.
2,Not what they promised us.,"Even though I love *Nsync to death, this album did not come out the way I thought. I was hoping for more songs like Bye,Bye, Bye and This I Promise You. Instead we are stuck with 13 songs that all sound alike and not too many love songs. Pop, the first single, is a great song,but all the other songs follow in the same funky style beat. Pop made me believe they were stonger musically. When I listened to the other songs, it sounded as if they were whining about there lives and wern't looking for a change."
2,pop timber in the lake,"hated it, what is this n sync sounds like new edition in 2000. more white boys tryin to sound black. they put something in that pop."
3,I don't even like n sync but this was a nice CD,"I heard pop on the radio and had no idea this was n sync and when I found out I thought I'd check out the rest of the album and I enjoyed several other songs like the rodney jerkins written celebrity that was another stand out track. The Game Is Over is made up of 80's video games sounds(think pac man) but sounds a bit too much like they were trying to recreate digital get down. Girlfriend was done nicely too but got annoying from being overplayed. That's all I remember about the CD right now cause I don't think it's really a classic(not even close) though it had a few stand out tracks. They were just a 5 minute pop band anyways that I'm sure someone has liked at some point, even if bye bye bye just made them bop their heads or something(I'm sure many might be guilty of THAT)"
4,Very strong album musically!,"I liked NSYNC's Celebrity. They definitely sound better musically in the singing and writing. No Strings Attached was the better album, but this album is heavy with strong numbers like Pop, The Game Is Over, Just Don't Tell Me That, Up Against the Wall (very fast song too!),Tell Me Tell ME, Selfish, and others. One of their best ballads is Gone, where Justin Timberlake sings so soulful on that song. Perhaps the buildup to his own hit album Justified. I like the one where Stevie Wonder plays harmonica. The songs with electronica hitmaker BT are dynamite here. This is a strong album to follow NSA and sell just as strong on its own!"
1,You have got to be kidding me....,"Simply some of the worst ehhhh... music on the planet. If they decided to play live in my driveway, I'd call the police and have them arrested..."
4,two step,"The music itself has come a long way, they are definetly sampling to prove that they are not ""boy band."" Trying two step, some techno...they've come a long way from their debut. The lyrics are just as catchy as ever, sometime a little lame ""if i couldn't have cheese like every day..."" all in all this one's a keeper!"
5,"*NSYNC, *NSYNC, *NSYNC!","I love this cd! I especially like Pop (Duh) and Celebrity. Celebrity is an upbeat, peppy, energizing song, at least to me. So is The Game Is Over. The Two Of Us is great too! All the songs are great! I can't say enough about these 5 wonderful guys!! Ironically, this review is short. This cd is definately worth the money it's priced for. I have every single NSYNC album, and each one I have been pleased with. These guys have great harmony and incredible voices! If you are debating whether or not to buy it, BUY IT!"
3,N Sync has more potential then they showed in this album,"I enjoyed this CD the first time I heard it but after that it got really old really fast. It's not the type of CD you can listen to over and over liking it more everytime. No, this CD has a few good songs that are fun to listen to at certain times, like when you are goofing off with your friends or just driving and have nothing else to do. But the first thing I wondered was whether or not the members of the band actually thought their songs were inventive and origional, frankly I thought most of them sounded exactly alike. I mean how many songs can you make that sound more like a digital computer then singing. I am a fan of n sync but I was disappointed by this album because it sounded so generic, and I think that n sync is capable of more."
2,Not As Good As Some Make It Out To Be,"I got this CD 2 days after it came out thinking that it was gonna be some great thing. It sounds like all their other CDs just with different words to their songs. They use no real instruments, and Justin and JC are the only ones that sing, how stale is that? I want some variety and I didn't feel I got any at all from this CD whatsoever. The group might as well be called JC and Justin cuz the other guys are basically just back up singers. I can't tell one song from the other. The only song that I really do like is ""Something Like You"", it has some meaning. So, in my opinion, this CD is not worth all the hype. But if you're that big on *N Sync I'm sure you will like it."
3,Still can't beat the first album,this cd is ok...will it break their NSA record? I doubt it... and it doesn't deserve to... NSA was a bunch of corny lyrics with hard beats and this cd is about the same. Pop is the only good song so far but there are some other nice tunes...all the slow tracks are good and the uptempos sound pretty bad.. I think Nsync are really talented but they just need to stick to ballads where they feature all the voices and harmonies and not just the two whiny guys- justin n jc... props to writing more songs on this album..but its still not better than the first... i just hate it how these boys make you think that they are doing something so wonderful and new...and when you buy it...its the same old stuff..just worse..so i say if you are a regular boy band fan..they you'll like it..but if not..dont start now... Black and Blue is a much better album
4,"After a sneak preview, i think i've been converted to a fan","My brother owns a record store, so i was able to get a sneak preview of the album today and i can say i was more than amazed. Usually i don't care at all for these ""boy bands"" or mainstream pop in general, but this album is amazing. The vocals are good, but i wish there would be more music on the record, which is why i've only given it 4 stars instead of five. Overall a good record, and maybe it will set a new record tommorrow. Enjoy the album."
1,horrible!,N sync is part of the worst genre ever. Every time I hear one of these songs my faith in humanity drops substantialy.DONT BUY THIS ALBUM.
5,Nothing like it!!,This cd is so good!! There is no other cd or sound like it. Once again they have great harmonies and songs. I listen to it all the time.
4,"Surprisingly Good, for a BOY BAND","As a guy that listens to rock and hip hop, I never was a N sync fan. That is until I had to do security at their Oakland,CA ""Popoddesy"" tour for two days. I was surprised at the stage, 100 foot screen TV, fireworks, conveyor belts, The works to make a successful show. After I worked the show, I went and purchased the CD.On thier third effort, J.C and Justin managed to pull off some of the dirtiest pop I've ever ran across. Thier CD is well built on up tempo dance music. And they've also did some production themselves.Songs like ""the game is over"" is pretty darn good for a boy band. But you have funk driven beats like ""girlfriend"" and ""Celebrity"" that put this CD into mainstream rotation big time. I predict this CD to go Diamond (10 million+). As far as the boy band reputation goes, they have earned my respect and I look at them totally different now."
1,not again!,"I thought they said ""celebrity"" would be different from ""No Strings Attached?""Nope.It still sounds the same.Justin and J.C. are still the only ones that sing{figures}.Plus,""Pop"" is so annoying and dumb,I barely get what they are trying to make a point of.At least the Backstreet Boys can try different sounds and still sound good."
1,Puppets Indeed,This latest effort by America's favorite plastic boys is nothing but another crushing blow for music itself. How long are we going to let coporate creations rule the airwaves?
2,Smart marketing,"There was some smart marketing done for this album. The first single ""Dirty Pop"" sounds similar to the songs off No Strings Attached showing that NSync has once again written catchy dance/pop songs. However, this single doesn't fit with the rest of the CD. All of the songs are completely different and don't have the same dance/pop feel as songs in their past. While that isn't always a bad thing since it means that the group is growing in the abilities, I just feel that consumers are being mislead into buying the album believing that it will be No Strings Attached Part 2.The rest of the CD is pretty boring with little other songs that are worth listening to. I found myself moving to the next song because I got bored with the current one. The group used too much digital equipment and vocoders that ruined the songs. They should have confidence in their ability to harmonize and stay away from electronica. It doesn't work for them."
2,Sound like something I've heard before.....,"I Didn't buy the album, but my sister who is an NSYNC junkie went out an bought it this morning and I had to listen to it in the car like 6 times. Anyways... I don't suggest buying it. It's got it's perks... like the catchy ""PoP"" and ""Celebrity"" but as a whole the album has the same sound as their previous ""No Strings Attatched"" For all the hype that was put on this album it was dissapointing in the end. I do not suggest purchasing ""Celebrity"" because you can just pop in ""No Strings Attatched"" and save your self $15, I mean they are practically the same... Same drippy love ballads, same Nothing but Tecno songs... same Justin and JC sing everything and leave the other three members in he dust.... This album really isn't worth it."
4,What happened?,"If you were expecting a bigger and greater version of No Strings Attached, you were wrong. On this cd nsync takes on a whole new beat and style of music never heard from them before. Now don't get me wrong because this cd is still awesome but just does not top NSA. Some of the songs are a little corny but they do not affect the overall rating of the cd. If you are an nsync fan I would definitly say it is a good buy!"
1,"N-sync, give me Justin Back","I could barely hear Justin Timberlake's voice. I was so disappointed. Save your money and make an intelligent choice on your music. I'm starting to listen to more intelligent music, like blonde redhead, melody for certain damaged lemons, and other indy favorites, as I go from elementary school to junior high."
2,"Weak, weak, weak. EVEN by pop's standards.","I guess ""The Two Of Us"" is passable, but skates dangerously close to filler as does ""Pop"". Thank goodness it's somewhat catchy...The absolute filler tracks though, are: ""Celebrity"", ""Tell Me, Tell Me...Baby"" (UGH. TERRIBLE. Almost as bad as the horrid, ""Celebrity"", ""Up Against The Wall"" (Yawn...), ""See Right Through You"" (Whatever...it just ain't believe-able), ""Just Don't Tell Me That""; Hell, pretty much the whole album is plagued with filler after filler tracks.The only decent songs are ""Gone"" (a pop classic) and ""Girlfriend"". The songs that are tolerable are ""The Two Of Us"", the half-hearted ballad, ""Selfish"" and the sneakin'-around-sounding-production on ""Something Like You"". The rest is absolutely trashy filler material.Do yourself a favor today and don't look back to 2001. At least not for this CD!! Go back a year to 2000, and pick up Nelly Furtado's ""Whoa, Nelly!"". Now THAT'S a classic pop album!2 stars. Sorry."
5,Great buy,"IF you own No Strings Attached, then this is a must buy. N'Sync's unique lyrics and sound can be heard throughout the entire cd. While their previous cd contained only a few songs that I enjoyed, I was pleased to discover that all of the songs included in Celebrity are magnificent. Great to play anywhere, particularly while driving."
3,Good cd but not their VERY best!,"I love the new cd but their previous cd was much better! Pop is a good track, a lot of the tracks are good but they have done better. Plus this cd sounds too plastic, like fake music? Or computer made sounds?"
2,Blah,"While I think it's great that the guys write alot of their own material and produce alot of their own songs, this CD is the worst I've bought in quite some time. I'm not an *N SYNC basher, I have been a fan since before most people even knew who they were (6 years ago). The only reason I gave this CD 2 stars is for ""Gone"" which has nice vocals and is an all-around awesome song. The whole ""dirty pop"" thing is overdone. How about going back to good ballads and REAL danceable songs?? I applaud them for trying to mature their sound, but they are going in the wrong direction. I'll gladly listen to any other *NSYNC CD but the only thing I'll be doing with my copy of Celebrity is using it as a coaster..."
4,Awesome,This Cd is really good. The one thing I don't like about it is that most of it is slow songs. The lyrics are really good and the tune also really sticks in your head. I strongly suggest you buy this cd. Have fun!~Howdy5858
4,*N Credible,"This CD deserves 4.5 stars, only because I liked No Strings Attached more. ""Pop"" is definitely the best song on the CD. I like songs with really good beats and Justin's beatbox is really super good! I also like ""Selfish"". It's beautiful. I'm glad *Nsync has gotten a different sound here. Variety is good. Way to go, guys."
2,this just wasnt as good as i expected,"i bought this having high hopes from previous albums, N'Sync and No Strings Attatched. Those two albums were great. However Celebrity just falls short. If you're expecting a pop sound like their first album, you're gonna get a more R&B flavor... Now the guys from N'Sync actually write their own songs ( Justin and JC mostly )... They should go back to their old ways and just sing because they cant write songs. there are some good tracks, POP and Up AGAINST THE WALL are probalbly the best ones, the rest are just average to bad. This sounds kinda weird but i thought THE GAME IS OVER sounded like DIGITAL GET DOWN from NO STRINGS ATTATCHED. Well whatever, no matter how bad this album is people will still buy it because its NSYNC. Come on NSYNC you guys can do better next time"
1,What is up with this CD?,I was so excited to get the CD! My parents bought my sister and I each one so we wouldn't fight over them. When I listened to it I was so sick to my stomach that I told my mom to sell it .... It sounded like a bunch of junk. Who wants to hear about a bunch of guys that get cheese everyday? Don't waste your time buying this CD. I look at them in a whole different way. These guys are only in it for the money and don't even care about the message they are sending out to kids today.
1,bad singing makes BAD MUSIC,"need i say more? again, like the last album ""no strings attached"", ""celebrity"" is another studio synthesized/manufactured one. if offers no quality music whatsoever. i have this CD and i'm ashamed of myself for even still having it.btw, the name of this album is very pompous don't u think?? well, these guys sure aren't anymore, not counting JT, who's a little over his head w/his dumb music"
5,...and they'll never stop...,"I'll admit, I was very skeptic as to whether this CD would be any good. The song titles didn't sound too convincing. But after I got it home, I realized that I would never have to buy another single for remixes again. (Of course I'll still buy them, but I won't have a good reason.) Not only are the songs easy to dance to, but there are only 3 slow songs which come at very convenient times and don't break my groove. I think one of the best things is that they (Justin and JC) collaborated on 80% of this album. (Justin mainly wrote with Wade Robson, who is only the most beautiful living object ever.) So, as they had hoped, they are maturing and, at the risk of turning anyone off, getting ghetto-fabulous!"
4,Third time's a charm,"I was very skeptical of what this album would sound like. The guys have grown up so much from their debut album and I was afraid that they would lose their sound as so many groups tend to after they hit it big. But the 'NSync boys have proven with this album (at least to me) that their talent is enduring and that they are original. The dance tunes on this disc (which is the vast majority of them) are memorable and easy on the saccharine. Although ""No Strings Attached"" was really a triumph, I would have been disappointed if they put out an identical album. I appreciate the consistency, yet more grown-up sound of 'NSync on this album."
5,THE BEST YET!,"Yest again Nsync shows their skills ! this is a awsome album trust me its not your normal "" PoP "" album.If you like Nsync You would love this album!!! buy it! NSYNC ROCKS #1 ..."
1,Waste of Time,"I started out being a big nsync fan, but their music keeps getting worse as each album comes out. On their new CD, Celebrity, the songs are all the same with pointless lyrics. Their style has really gone down. If you're considering this cd, don't buy it unless you want to waste your time, and money."
2,Dissapointment,"CD BREAKDOWN: 13 songs; 3 slow songs (none as good as my personal fav. This I Promise You"" 10 ""pop"" songs. the majority of the pop songs were too repeditive in their beats, and were just uninteresting, and not moving at all, for the most part. I found one of the songs to be over the top in the lameness category. Song number 3, called ""the game is over"" starts off with a chain of video game sound effects. I wanted to throw up, pictureing a crowed of 13 year old girls jamming to this worthless track. NSYNC needs to improve their next cd by evening out the fast/slow song ratio; and making the fast songs good, and not something i could just as easily turn on my NINTENDO game system to hear the same thing. I gave this CD 2 stars for the songs ""POP"" and the exceptional slow, R&B type song, ""GONE."""
4,"NSYNC ""Celebrity""","Nsync has said that they want to grow and change with each cd, and ""Celebrity"" is definitely a departure from their previous projects. This cd goes more into the techno/electronica style that they used on Digital Getdown or Space Cowboy. They use two-step (a style popular in the UK) on the tracks ""The Two of Us"" and ""Up Against the Wall"", and they are awesome. ""The Game Is Over"", co-written by JC, starts out with pac-man type sound affects - very cool! Don't expect to put this cd and hear the same old NSYNC; these songs are different then any they've done. However, the harmonies are still there, with Justin taking lead on most songs. 10 out of 13 tracks were co-written by Justin and JC. Overall, this is a great cd!"
3,"Purty good...just too much ""techno pop""","Well, ""Celebrity"" is a decent album. I had been hoping for more ballads, but oh well. Most of the songs are decent, I just don't care for all the computer sound effects. My favorite tracks are ""Selfish"", ""Tell Me, Tell Me..Baby"", Something Like You"" and ""Pop."" It was good to see the guys writing so many of the songs this time around as well."
5,*NSYNC's Celebrity is well-worth it,"*NSYNC's third american release ""Celebrity"" definitely deserves 5 stars. It's hip-hop/pop sound is very catchy. Every song on the album is something that should be listened to. Justin and JC of *NSYNC had written quite a few songs on the album and it shows their raw songwriting talent. It's a great listen so get it! I've only had it one day and I cannot stop listening to it!"
3,JC and Justin are the celebrities,"I guess I missed the newsflash that Lance, Chris, and Joey have been denoted to the role of being backup singers. I give JC and Justin props for writing a majority of the songs on the CD, but I was really disappointed to not hear more solos from the other guys. All in all, the CD's not bad and it has a good mix of sounds. It has the normal ballads (""Selfish"") and upbeat pop tracks (""Celebrity""), mixed with smooth R&B sounding tracks (""The Two Of Us""). As a long-time 'N Sync fan, I like the CD - I was just expecting more equality in the singing. I think they've all proved they can sing - why not give them all an opportunity to show it?"
1,"N Sync's ""Celebrity"" is a tragedy.","Pop music is on the decline. N Sync proves this point through their bland, artificially synthesized track ""Pop,"" where they reveal their insecurity about their current fad-star status. They cleverly try to brainwash their teeny-bopper fans by declaring pop is ""not a trend."" N Sync's days at the top are numbered and even they know as they try to declare otherwise, that they're about to crash and burn like Milli Vanilli, Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, and NKOTB. The Backstreet Boys are already imploding. N Sync shouldn't be far behind. To try and compare this piece of processed corporate plastic is blasphemy of the lowest order, and the only reason they get one star is because Amazon doesn't allow to give negative stars. -5 stars"
3,not a fan,"i myself used to be a huge nsync fan as a younger girl. i bought the first album, the christmas edition, and the export from germany. :) as i grew older the music became so blah to me. it was like it was fake...no 5 guys share the same feelings for girls. and poor girls actually think about marrige with these boys. and what makes me laugh is they are a ""boy band"" but these guys are almost 30! hahai listened to this cd in my friends car. and i got to thinking ""holy crap, what is this"" ""it sounds like all the other crap"". haha im not a fan of the teenibopper stuff at all but i do have to say n sync is better. and well, even though backstreet boys play some instruments, they dont write the music. its so funny to see little girls fight over whos better :)"
1,Worst cd EVER,"Nsync only deserves one award, the worst band acheivemnet since, well even before time. They don't write their own music, they don't play any instruments, and they just stink like poo. if u want to hear some REAL music, listen to some rock/punk/ style music."
2,huummm,"you must really love nsync to appreciate a little their music.although i feel they're gettin' less borin', their pop music is... special. there are some good stuffs in their music, but the lyrics ain't made to be sang on.it's a shame to let a rather good music to a band like nsync.they succed because of the support of crazy female fans, that's all. i bet girls don't even listen to nsync's music...i'm sorry for them, they have no real talent !!"
5,First Time I Could Stand Thier Music,"OK I am definately not one of those teeny bopper girls that is like gaga in love with Justin. In fact before I bought this CD I couldn't stand watching them on TRL. But I bought the CD because they reviews made the CD sound different from thier other ones. And believe it or not I actually like most of the songs. My favorites have to be ""Up Against the Wall"", ""Gone"", and ""Something Like You."" I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes pop music; there is something for everyone. And most of the CD doesn't sound like typical N'Sync."
1,Bye Bye Bye,"Ok I must admit, I love music, but I can't love it all.This boy band craze has gone overboard. I'm not meaning to rave on and on about the bad points on certain bands and don't mean to offend anyone but open your ears.Do you actually enjoy listening to Justin repeat ""Dirty Pop"" throughout the whole song?They then co-write some of the songs to show that they actually have a passion for music. NOT going to work.Sure they can sing and dance, I'll give 'em credit for that but they sing anything that is put in front of them.They tried to ditch the pop sound and add a little bit of hip-hop into the album with ""Up Against the Wall"" and ""Dirty Pop"", while still clinging onto their ballads like ""Selfish.""NSYNC was ok in the beginning but they're just another boy band. They're annoying themselves. Say ""Bye Bye Bye"" to them!"
2,Celebrity is an ego trip,"NSync first really good album was ""No Strings Attached"" it was catchy with wonderful dance musice and ballads. Now comes the much anticipated ""Celebrity"" what a let down. Thought that this album would be a step up for NSync instead it was a step down. Seems like the boys don't sing enough, and are very ego oriented in the song ""Celebrity"". I love NSync but.......was very disappointed in this album. Hope the next is back on track and better then ""Celebrity"""
5,THE BEST CD I OWN!,"...This CD is original, energy filled entertainment with just enough slow songs to satisfy everyone. Even if you don't like the appearence that *NSYNC gives you, they'll make it up to you with this album. ""The Game Is Over"" reminds me of Pac Man and gives clever lyrics relating a girl who is cheating on her boyfriend and and an actual game. ""Selfish"", ""Something Like You"", and ""Gone"" are the 3 slow songs on the LP, they all are similar to ""This I Promise You"". ""Just Don't Tell Me That"" is my favorite song on the album it being fast beated, catchy and just all around great. This album is clever, different, and catchy. They'll have a hard time outdoing themselves this time. Of course that's what I said when No Strings Attached came out."
1,UMM...NO THANKS,"I only HAD to hear this breifly because of friend of my enjoys pop. I did not like it at all. If you like music other than pop you will hate this,personaly I do. They don't play there own instruments or write there own music, and they didn't even form the ""band"" themselves.Sorry *nsync fans but this mad me want t puncture my own eardrums that is if the music doesnt do it."
4,Review of //\\//SYNC's Celebrity,"I am a big fan of //\\//SYNC. They are my 2nd favorite band (beaten only by Destiny's child). I decided to give this c-d a 4 out of 5 because I sort of liked //\\//SYNC's new sound. I would have given it 3 stars but I gave it 4 because this album is different from all the other albums. JC and Justin wrote most of the songs on this c-d and the songs range from ""dirty pop"" to bubblegum pop to fierce and funky dance songs to r and b type songs. I believe that each song shows a different aspect of the writer's (JC or Justin) personality and life. I think these songs were very important and emotional for //\\//SYNC. I liked No Strings Attached better because the songs were catchier but the songs on this album have more meaning. It is a great c-d for //\\//SYNC fans and any other lovers of ""boy bands""."
4,Stronger than might be expected...,"Although certainly not a fan of boy band genre music, I appreciate some of it; and I can tell that this is about as good as it gets. The beats are engaging, and they manage to develop their own style more completely, securing their uniqueness from the Backstreet Boys. Their concert is awesome as well .. the popodyssey tour. There's no doubt this will be a best seller, but it just might transcend the typical young girl crowd. Much of the material is stronger than the first single ""Pop"". If you have any interest in what their new sound is, I'd advise picking this up. Or do like I did and borrow it from your little sister."
2,Nsync's CD was a disapointment....,"I have all the other Nsync CD's and I went to their Pop Oddessey Tour and I was really looking forward to this CD. Personally, I think that it is terrible. All the tracks sound the same, Justin's voice is really whiny, and it just doesn't sound good. Not to forget that it mostly sounds fake, because their voices are computerized in the begining of all the songs just about. Don't waste your money. I hope the Backstreet Boys will realize that the new Nsync CD isnt good and that they don't go down this path with their new cd out early 2002."
4,Nsync Does It Again!,"Once again nsync has put out a good cd that will send teens from everywhere out to the store to buy it. It is a lot like No Strings Attached but they also have some new sounds to their songs. I really like this cd and if you have liked nsync's past cd's then i am sure you will love this one! It has there fast, pop, dance songs on it but also has a few slow sweet songs that really get to you. I recommend that if you like nsync then to go buy Celebrity b/c i know you will love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Showing Signs of the slump,","This album is not good either coming off their biggest album of their career ""No Strings Attached"", they released ""Celebrity"" in July 2001 and it debuted with strong numbers. If I remember I think it was 1.8 Million copies but as I said about the Teen Bubble this album showed signs it was ending here especially since it didn't stay on the charts that long or that it only sold 5 million versus 11 million their previous album sold. Also this album didn't get as much press after it was released. Unfortunatly for them they will go down with all the other teen idols as has beens."
5,"well, ummm.... kinda 5 stars, but great!","Honestly, I LOVE NSYNC(capital letters),but this album could have some replacements.Do your thing-ummm, i actually hate itit is one of the worst nsync songs(should be replaced with That girl (will never be mine))The two of us-after owning popodyssey live(the best video in the world)i think it is good because of the dancinggirlfriend-the remix with nelly is betterfalling should be on the albumill never stop should be on the albumthe rest of it is great"
1,"unorijinal , boring and overall terrible",I couldnt even get through this cd once. All the songs sound exactly the same. The lyrics are nonsensical and mindless.A good buy for wastin your money.
1,Music so bad that even Satan won't let in Hell!,"Toro: Say Pancho, wasn't Out of Sync a bad bunch of gringos. Pancho: Aye Caramba Toro, they were stupido. Toro: At least they are now dead. Pancho: Their last album had clunkers like Gone and Girlfriend and Pop. Toro: They broke up because they hate each other. Pancho: They all hate Stinkercake for leaving them high and dry after he became successful. Toro and Pancho say if you own this, like Cranky Reviewer and his boyfriends, you will become flies for us to eat. BAMINOS PRONTO from these stupido gringos!"
1,Argh,"Has the music industry really got to the point where talentless ""musicians"" who don't even play their own instruments battle unoriginal rappers and good-bands turned blink 182 for supremacy on the Billboard charts. Its gotten so bad that i actually have to cheer for bad rap-metal bands (like Limp Bizkit) because they can actually play a single chord on a guitar. This CD and CDs like it are further proof why no one under 14 should be allowed to buy music. They have no taste and their impressionable minds are easily brainwashed by shiny objects and bright colors.In the future i envision dancers dancing to prerecorded beats dominating the charts. N'Sync gets 0 stars for inching us one step closer to the end of the world."
3,At Least They Really Tried,"I would give NSync 5 stars if this CD were based on effort, because judging from their interviews, it seemed like they tried very hard to break out of the teeny-bop pop shell that used to engulf our world of music. But maybe they tried too hard, because most of their songs sound the same: angry, techno, pop. The best songs on the album are the slow ones, ""Selfish"" & ""Someone Like You"", but those ballads aren't even their best ballads. The fast, upbeat dance tracks aren't catchy enough, and I found myself getting tired of the songs easily and skipping the tracks more often. I have 7 NSync CDs, and many NSync fans might disagree, but I think 'Celebrity' is their worst. I bought the CD because it got great reviews, and just to add it to my collection, I guess....but sadly, I was disappointed. I'd take the old NSync any day, and the bubblegum 'No Strings Attached' over the dirty pop 'Celebrity'."
4,What you will need....,"This is a good EP with remixes from bands such as Covenant, Negative Format, Sabotage(Inception label mates) etc. It's worth checking out if you like remixes...personally I tend to like the original better (with few exceptions). If your feeling tenitive about making this purchase at least be sure to pick up Viral Extinction if you don't already have it. That's a release that's worth 5 stars! Unfortunately I can't say I feel the same about Flesh Field's newest realease Belief Control. I personally didn't care for it, yet am keeping my fingers crossed for something equally as powerful as V.E. in the future."
3,A good first effort that has moments of great writing,"The author has done an excellent job of starting what I hope is a series. He still needs to smooth out his character dialogue style (no one uses the other person's name in every sentence of a conversation!), but the plot is well conceived, and the main character, Phil Costanza, is a likable--and believable--person. There is one pasasge in the book in which an old professor lays dying in the hospital. Costanza's interaction with the man (and with the attending physician before and after the death) and the description of the man's dying thoughts is truly a beautiful piece of writing. In fact, it's almost as if it were by a different, better writer. Hopefully, Mr. Peterson will extend this excellence throught his entire next book."
1,"This dinky plastic ""handle"" is extremely overpriced - don't buy it!","I ordered this as a Christmas present for my brother-in-law, but was very disappointed when I received it. The tap is much smaller than it appears (6 inches tall) and is simply two cone shaped pieces of plastic that fit together. The plastic is cheap and scratched... this item is WAYYYY overpriced. Upon delivery there are no instructions or materials for customizing it. I feel like I got taken advantage of."
1,GARBAGE,After 1 use this piece of junk became stuck and I can't even remove the black insert to change it out. Do not buy this or anything else from Kegworks. Their customer service wasn't the least bit helpful and would not offer a refund or even an exchange. Probably the worst customer service I've ever heard. I own a bar and WOULD have bought quite a few of these but won't be spending another cent at Kegworks.
4,Template would be nice,"Bought this a gift, they don't come with a template but found one on line...it would have been nice if it came with a template so you don't have to go looking for one. Everything else is just as I expected."
4,"Who will triumph, and what will be left of them?","I would advise the young to follow up their college-class readings of LORD OF THE FLIES with this book, about the war of residents in a high-rise, in which the outside world seems to dissapear and all that matters is the world inside, and the struggle (quite literally!) to the top. This is the postmodern, techno-age version of LORD OF THE FLIES, and implies that instead of an island, we have created our own fortresses and islands, in our age of apartment buildings, condos, and antiseptic, sealed-off living spaces. But we can not escape from ourselves, after all."
4,Frightening,"It didn't give me nightmares, but... Ok! High-Rise is one of Ballard's best, but it's extremely disturbing. It's much more readable than his dark, freakish ""Crash,"" but just as powerful.One of SF's finest craftsman, Ballard is an expert at revealing insights towards human nature. Thus, after decades, his works are not dated, as much of the genre's works are. Like any decent SF, this was written not about where we are headed, but about where we already are. And this book is about the violent tendencies to human nature, and as long as we stay this way, this book will be important.Violent, weird, violent again, but powerful."
3,"Freakish, Obsessive . . .","I've read this book twice now, and I wouldn't say it's my favourite Ballard book so far, which isn't to say it doesn't have its good points. Freakish, creepy and obsessive, the story tracks the disintegration of a newly-built highrise from the pinnacle of modern convenience to a twisted and perverse enclosed world of primitive survival.I found a lot of repetition in the narrative, which got a little annoying at times. Typical themes found so frequently through Ballard's work are here - internal psychology in relation to external environment, voyeurism and perversion of the affluent, and so on. Some parts even made me feel quite squeamish, and I wouldn't say this would be one for the fainthearted.Certainly worth the read for Ballard fans and fans of literature in a similar vein, I don't think this would be my first choice to new readers."
3,This book is currently available NEW from Amazon.co.uk!,And it's more affordable than the used editions sold here!.....
2,Be very careful when using this filter,"This filter only has a 2 micron filtration rating. It is effective against most important waterborne protozoa (giardia and cryptosporidium), but will not filter any harmful bacteria. you should only use this filter in a clean mountain stream that has not been contaminated with fecal material. If you use this filter in a pond or standing water, you are asking for trouble. More expensive filters are rated to 0.2 microns and are effective at removing harmful bacteria. One previous review stated that this filter produced water at a faster rate and clogged less than a more expensive filter. That is likely a very true statement as the filtration pore size on the cheap filter is 10X bigger! If a more expensive filter is clogging, it is doing its job of removing particles that would otherwise end up in your drinking water. Do not assume that all filters are created equal, and just because you run water through some device does not make it safe to drink."
3,Not his best,"There are much better King Sunny records out there. This one is a very western-style pop album, as others have noted. It's definitely fun to listen to, but isn't as characteristic of his 'authentic' style.A fun listen regardless."
4,Quiet,"I still can't believe how quiet this machine is. It's no Mac, but it makes my two-year old Pavilion sound like a positive racket. Nice and fast, too. One warning, and the reason for the missing star: this machine is not currently upgradeable. The earliest release of compatible RAM is scheduled for May. I was VERY disappointed to hear this. HP support (very fast, very nice) will tell you that you cannot upgrade the machine. This panicked me, since it is not what the documentation says, but, technically they're correct. You'll have to wait to upgrade the RAM on this puppy. Until the upgrades are available, this is a serious problem."
1,this is a piece of junk,"this computer is a piece of junk, fist the 250 watt power supply is not enough for the system , I have replaced everything in this unit since day one power supply twice (which was under warranty) disk drives , cd rom , floppy etc and of course the motherboard , which has to be tatu and you cant just get a motherboard with out buying a new operating system, dont waste your time on this unit ! hp used to be the best for gods sake dont buy this computer!"
4,Super Album!!,"1999 may have come and gone, but does that mean the album's a throw away? No! You've got the classic singles--""1999"" (a ""personal"" number 1), ""Little Red Corvette"" and ""Delerious"" and then there's ""Let's Pretend We're Married"", ""Something in the water (Does not Compute)"" and ""International Lover"" that really makes this album special. It may be a little long and dated, but no one can go wrong here."
5,not for flinchy people!!,"This is an awesome, awesome cd. However, they should really have put one of those parental advisory stickers on this thing! Now, I don't mind that sort of thing at all, but uptight or immature people might get pissed off. Little kids shouldn't listen to it....unless they want to actually learn something useful....There really are no bad tracks. Everybody knows the title track, and most people know Little Red Corvette, but the real treat on this album, I think, is D.M.S.R. It's this great, funky dance song that's 8 minutes long (not uncommon for this album). Another great, long dance song is Lady Cab Driver, which you may want to switch it at the end because it gets a little graphic.The only song that I didn't love on this album was ""Delirious"", because it just seemed a little goofy to me. But all the other songs are absolutely fabulous, and they'll be absolutely fabulous 50 years from now."
3,The party's not as fun as I thought,"While its electro-rock-pop prowess is undeniable, I struggle to see the overwhelming praise hoisted upon this specific disc as being accurate, as the album consists of a majority of sub-par songs in relation to its breakout singles which became famous."
5,My Favorite Prince album,"Since ""Soft and Wet"", I have been a huge Prince fan and I have watched from the begining how he developed into the international superstar that he is today. Just about all of Prince's albums are wonderful ,but 1999 is my favorite. Prince was at his creative peak during the period between Controversy and 1999. 1999 as a result captures Prince at his best. 1999 is a tremendous mixture of funky beats, sexual innuendo, and incedible imagery. I especially like DMSR, Lady Cab Driver, Let's Pretend We're Married, and of course Little Red Corvette. Prince is a genius and the album justifys it."
5,The no name man,"When it comes to being strange, he's #1, when it comes to music, he's in the top 10. DMSR is funk for the ages.."
5,1999 proves to be one of Prince's greatest albums,1999 is probaly one of my favorite Prince cds. I love every track on the album. My favorite song is Little Red corvette. All the instruments on 1999 are played wonderfully.
4,The 80s BEST.,"Forget Michael Jackson. This guy Prince was the greatest talent of the 80s and as close a talent to Jimi Hendrix as black music has seen since. He took the 80s sound and made it move with a clever blend of synths, guitars, female backing vocals and guts.1999 & Little Red Corvette are CLASSICS!"
1,This is one of the worst of the 80's,"I knew after 1983 things would never be the same with Rock and Roll ever again. The music was becoming more clean sounding with technology more or less replacing the majority of musicians. This would be one of the first ones. I remember hearing the first single from this which was ""Little Red Corvette"" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is ""Let's Pretend We're Married"". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was ""Delirious"". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical? I just am appalled at the way music wound up, and it all started here."
3,Oddly difficult to read,"While Markham is clearly very knowledgeable on the subject, I found this text confusing and unsuccessful. It tried to be a kind of military biography and I found the result sketchy. It provided neither the background for the Napoleonic wars that I was looking for nor a personal biography of Napoleon himself.Markham does offer interpretations of the rise and fall of Napoleon that were interesting and probably are what distinguish this work from other books about the subject. My problem was that I did not have enough context in my own knowledge to place those interpretations appropriately. This book might well have been useful to someone with a more extensive background in either Napoleon or his age, but it was not useful to me."
2,please keep ME awake!!,I had to read this book for my high school history class. I actually found it to be rather dry reading. It got to the point where I had to force myself to read it. This could of course be explained by my distaste for history in general and the fact that I was on summer vacation at the time.
4,sound mind of girls in countryside,"gives sane atmosphere of girls in countryside, even young men, too, which is different nowadays from that of Norah Jones. But I feel a bit kind of ""I would like to come away with her."" Just joking."
4,Warning:do not play this in the dark,"Some of the songs here are scary as hell but I don't know why. I guess it's the way the guitars are played or the eerie solos. The ""scariest songs"" are Silent Scream and Live Undead. It's not the vocals but the lyrics are scary too.It got a 4-star rating for those songs and the cream of the crop,""Ghosts of War"". This song is real Slayer and has the style they're known for. The only thing wrong with this one is the lack of thrash on it. Only about four songs are thrash metal and the rest are slow and I don't like that. But overall it's a pretty good release."
5,HAMMER IN YOUR HEAD!,"The Best album of Slayer. Also it is the heaviest and thrashiest. Music and lyrics are great. To all Slayer fans: If you gonna buy ""Divine Intervention"", never think of it! Buy this or ""Hell Awaits"". These guitars are HEAVIER than HELL!"
5,The best Slayer album,"South of Heaven has the best guitar solos and riffs. The drumming is also very fast and technical. All the songs are pretty good, especially the title track, South of Heaven. It gives a nice, haunting feel and a creepy edge as you listen to the introduction."
2,Dissapointing,"Slayer really took a step back when they produced this album. Pressured by a major label Arya's vocals lack the usual intensity given in Reign in Blood and earlier albums. This isn't a typical Slayer album, and the songs take a much slower approach. If you like Arya's usual vocals and Lomabardo's speedy drum pace don't pick up this album."
5,"Excellent, yet slightly underrated","I would say now that this is an essential album to own. In fact in some ways I think it's better than Seasons in the Abyss. It has the same style of sound as Seasons, but I found it to be way cleaner and way leaner with more punch. Major highlight is Mandatory Suicide. Obviously you can't top Reign in Blood, but with Rick Rubin still producing Slayer, the band can still continue to venture to new places in their realm of Thrash Metal. This is one of Slayer's finest."
4,Underrated CD,"Although Reign In Blood and Seasons in the Abyss are rightfully considered Slayer's best work, this one isn't far behind in my opinion.If you have bought this after Reign In Blood the first thing you notice in South of Heaven is the injection of melody and the slowed down pace on many of the songs. That's not to say that Slayer went soft. The more melodic tracks on this album are actually the most evil sounding such as the title track and the excellent ""mandatory suicide"".Despite the imagery of the cover and some of the earlier songs, the band moves away somewhat from satanic references and there is a defnite social commentary aspect to this album; the horrors of war and the greed of organised religion are strong themes.I recommend this as an essential Slayer purchase along with Reign in Blood, Seasons and Hell Awaits."
4,Strong effort,"On South of Heaven, Slayer seemed to slow down a bit from the super-fast sound of Reign in Blood. Alot of people weren't pleased. Me neither at first. But this is really an album that will grow on you. It is just as intense as Reign in Blood, even if the approach to evil is different. The slower tempo, makes it more a sneaking menace on your soul, than an all out attack. It might not be as groundbreaking as the previous, Reign in Blood. But I think that Slayer really shows courage by trying something new and different, instead of creating a Reign in Blood-clone.I am sure that even the nay-sayers will change their mind after listening to this album through a few times. If you to listen to it without expecting Reign in Blood II you will really see the qualities of this album."
4,SLAYER!,"Not as hard as hell awaits or reign in blood but still good....best tracks south of heaven, mandatory suicide, silent scream, crooked cross..the second half of the cd is not as solid as the first but the songs I mentioned above are worth the price of the album"
4,if some songs were a little fast i would give it a five,"now this slayer album is a follow up to their all time classic reign in blood.this album is slayers first work was to feature some slow tempos.but im a speed freak and slayers not that great when they play slow songs(they rule when they play fast songs) but some tracks in here are fast.the best songs in here are south of heaven,mandatory suicide,and spill the blood.this was a little boring,and my least fav slayer album of the 80's.but in my final opion buy it if you like a few slow tempos,i know i dont,but i think this is okay"
5,Headbangers' delight,"This album reflects the continuing degradation of our world and the defilement of the souls of mankind. I know there are heaps of good rappers and metal bands out there with lyrically disturbing songs, but I can truly say that Slayer is the ONLY band that has ever made me cry. Listen to the tracks Silent Scream, Mandatory Suicide and Read Between the Lies and you'll know exactly what I mean. The truth is ugly."
4,Classic and Mandatory Slayer,"Slayer's fourth album, ""South of Heaven"" was a considerable departure from their previous efforts. The album on the whole was slower, more melodic and the subject matter actually touched on some serious issues (though there was plenty of the usual violence and occult subject matter fans were used to). The album contains two undisputed Slayer classics: ""South of Heaven"" and ""Mandatory Suicide"", the former being perhaps my favorite Slayer song. The album also has several lesser known classics such as ""Behind the Crooked Cross"", ""Silent Scream"" and ""Spill the Blood"". All of the tracks are good, however the Priest cover ""Dissident Agressor"" seems out of place. Also Tom's attempts at singing don't quite work, luckily he switched back to his trademark vocal style on their next album. Anyway, in closing this is an essential Slayer album, one of their best. Buy it."
4,Slayer attacks!,"This is one great album. The eerieness of ""Silent Scream"", the heaviness of ""Live Undead"", the forebodingness of ""South of Heaven""...buy this album now!!!"
2,"slower, heavier....","..but still fairly boring.'Dissident Aggressor' is the best track on the album, and they didn't write it!This album is proof positive that Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman couldn't play the guitar, and should've got a real job instead.Bottom Line: 'Hell Awaits' isn't a bad album - this album is fairly pathetic."
3,A big disappointment after Reign in Blood,"I can't believe that this CD is given an average of 4 1/2 stars. It doesn't even compare to Show No Mercy, Hell Awaits, or the best metal album of all time, Reign in Blood. The latter album was literally pushed to the limit in speed and quality of music, so I guess Slayer decided to take a break with South of Heaven and Seasons in the Abyss. Both of these albums sound more like rehashed Metallica than true Slayer. Yes, this album is worth buying, but only if you plan on buying all of their albums. There are some good songs on South of Heaven, but Spill the Blood and Mandatory Suicide are really lame. If a band excells at speed metal, why slow down and produce something like this?"
1,Bunch of noise.,This album is terrible. Gives me a headache! I like heavy music but there has to be some musical ability involved.This is probably the worst album ever recorded in the history of metal.
1,south of heaven,"i bought this cd over at z-records and i was hoping thois would be a good slayer album, its not i hated it with a passion, all the songs suck, exept 1 and thats why i gave it 1 stars, everyone knows what that 1 song is, thats the only highlight of the entire cd...i was dissapointed, so i just put in some divine intervention."
5,Hard to like at first but after a while its awesome.,"First of all the first few times I heard this I didnt like it very much.I thought it was a disappointingly weak,slow,even quiet bizarre piece of work that was totally unlike Slayer but after a few more tries I started to fall in love with it.The guitar is deep and melodic and the solos are still fast and memorable.After a while the lyrics grow on you and disturb you and you cant help but feel a deep passion for it all.The first song is the best one if you ask me but I like the Judas Preist cover a lot too and Ghosts Of War is one of Slayers best songs.That about wraps it up.So long."
4,One of Slayer's best,I think this album next to Seasons in the Abyss is the best Slayer has done. I had heard from different people that it was a good one. I decided to see for myself and was not disappointed. I like the way the music is put together in this. It seemed more thought out and not off the cuff like some of Slayer's albums have been. I have just about everything Slayer has put out and this is one of the best i think. If you like heavy metal meet the masters in this cd.
1,Rhythm Scarves,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. Awful quality - I can't even call fabric the polyester they're made from, feels more like plastic or a mosquito screen. The packaging bag was torn when I opened the outer bag as if someone took one look at them and sent them back. Please, don't waste your money, they are not returnable!!!!"
2,low quality- beware,I did not get what I was expecting with these scarves. It turned out they are just toulle cut up in squares with no hemming or anything. I could have done it myself. Quite disappointing.
1,shindig presents british invasion part 2,"although this video is a good nostalgic trip for teeny boppers in the 60's to reminisce the british groups on shindig, this 30 minute-video is not worth the price. i would instead recommend the dvd version of ""hullabaloo"" collection series which presents complete shows and more delightful to watch and the price is worth the 5 hours running time."
1,Buyer Beware,"I was being cheap, and cheap is what I got. Item arrived with creases that cannot be flattened, and one crease was bad enough that it distorts images. I'm using it, but I will replace it with a better product as soon as I feel secure enough."
1,DO NOT BUY,I wish I would have read the reviews on this product. It is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! Do not buy. Do not waste your time or money! It is incredibly thin. I probably could have purchased a small sheet of plastic like this from a craft store and been happier. I would never recommend this product to anyone. It was packaged fine but the sheet had many dents and scratches in it. DO NOT BUY.
1,Dont Bother,"I would rate this with negative stars if possible. This is basically a piece of plastic that probably cost 30 cents or so to manufacture. I went to Office Max to check out their deskpads prior to ordering on amazon. I thought that I found one comparable to this. It was about $25 in store. Since there weren't any reviews I took a chance and lost. It came in a huge box but was bent in half, with dimples and wrinkles. It is about as thick as 4 pieces of plastic wrap, but flimsy and brittle. It isn't worth returning at this point but I would have been better off initially spending more. Very disappointed."
1,horrible,The plastic came to. Me bent up like the ups ppl didn't give a dam not a good look so I want a new fresh not bent 1 okay!!!!
1,Ugh,"Completely awful. I wasn't expecting the greatest desk protector ever for the price, but at least deliver what you're selling. My desk is in an orthodontist office, and has to be around cold-sterile and the such, so I didn't want to spend a ton of money for basically a splash guard. I should have just spent an extra $10. This material is 100% not intended to be used as a desk mat and shouldn't be advertised as such. As someone else has already stated, cling wrap would have been just as good."
1,Damaged product,This product took a very long time to deliver and when received was badly damaged. Several corners were bent over and there were more than a dozen marred spots on the piece. Very disappointed.
1,"Too thin, arrived already creased","Although well packed, the desk protector arrived already creased. As someone else remarked, it is so thin that it doesn't lie flat on the desk. I had to weight down the corners and every time I move something around it wrinkles more. I only recieved this yesterday but doubt it will last more than a week."
3,"Very thin, but serves its purpose.","I purchased this simply to put on top of my desk to protect the wood from my pens, coffee, and keyboard. It is extremely thin (about equal to the thickness of a rigid smartphone screen protector). It did arrive with a few small pock marks (it's not expensive, what'd you expect?) It lies flat if you wipe down the surface with a damp rag first and then run a dry towel across first. This leaves just enough moisture to form a temporary bond that then dries in place. Be sure you are working in a clean environment when placing it down as the static electricity will attract everything and then you'll have stupid lumps."
1,"plastic desk protector/sheet 25"" x 40""",This is not an ideal protector. It creases so easily. It does NOT lay flat on whatever you are trying to protect. It's not a good product. Don't buy it. Buy those real office clear protector!
1,Item not what it appears,"I was not satisfied with this item. I thought I was getting a thicker protector, something that would actually serve as a practical cover. Because the plastic is so thin, when I opened the package, it was dented in several places and would not lay flat on the desk. It was not what I expected."
1,Nominal Desk Pad - Not Good,It came very well packed in a tube. I opened it and was very surprised at hoe filmsy it was. A good 6 mil vapor barrier used in home construction is thicker than this. They should mentioned the thickness of it. It was stiff and probably will provide some desk protection. I bought it for my son and I was embarrassed when we took it out of the package.cheap is cheap
1,Nice Cellophane Desk Protector,"For five bucks, I really wasn't expecting miracles, but this is ridiculous. I've got cellophane Christmas wrap that's thicker than this sheet. It also refused to even TRY to adhere to the desktop - I put it on and the breeze from my forced-air heating duct next to the desk blew it off. I'd send it back, but what's the point?"
4,wood burner kit,"Great little kit, nice box too. Got this to do some gourd crafting after shopping around a bit for a versatile inexpensive starter kit. This wood burner works very well. I would give it four and a half stars if I could due to the great price. There are better kits out there but the cost can run pretty high."
1,Maybe the third time will be a charm....,"I purchased wood burner from Walmart 3 years ago- it didn't come with many tips and didn't get hotter than 800-900 degrees. I started to do more woodburning and wanted to upgrade my burner.I found this one, got it, and LOVED IT. It came with many tips and got really hot- it burned nicely... then it died after minimal use. I sent it back, got a new one with no problems... and that one has died too :( So I'm not certain at this point if maybe the third time will be a charm. I don't understand what's going wrong. It died while I was burning a snowman image on a small piece of birch... I wasn't doing anything ""off the wall"" with it when it died. I wonder if it's overheating?"
4,Woodworker Pyro pen,"This is a nifty little item. It works wellfor projects that do no require a lot ofheavy burning. At 30 watts, it is a littleslow to recover it's heat when used. For themoney, it is quite good for light burning.It comes with a lot of extra different pointsand is suitable for a beginner. Advanced pyropen sets cost a few hundred dollars.I would buy it again. Very satisfied.Val GaronPreirieville, La."
4,Good for the money,"I have used this set for a couple of months now, and feel I can give an honest review of it. I found the Wall-Lenk kit to be quite good as far as solid-point woodburners go, it's the hottest burner of that kind I can find on the market. At full power, it makes a nice, dark clean burn on a variety of wood surfaces and would be good for anyone who wants to move up a little from the burners at the hobby shop but is not quite ready to splurge on a professional wire-tip burner set. The only reservation I would have is that unlike the Walnut Hollow burners, it has no on/off switch of its own and if you want that, you will have to get the temperature regulator along with it, but if you're serious about woodburning, the regulator is worth the additional investment."
3,Beware,"I would rate this higher except for a slight flaw in the design. (And by the looks, it's a very common flaw.)Take a close look at the photo. Do you see the two metal rings/cones above the tip and below the plastic handle? Those are metal, and get hot with the rest of the device. HOT. Hot as in I burned the heck out of a finger and afterwards some gloves.Where your hand is forced to stay on the handle is not where you instinctively want to hold something like this for good control. So not only is this awkward... there's also just a very tiny lip on the end of the handle to keep you hand off the metal rings.Otherwise the tips seem fine, heats up quick, ect, bla bla."
2,wall lenk woodburning pen,I returned this item as pen was very tinny and weak and broke when trying to change points even after allowing to cool TR
2,broken tips,"while using this tool to burn a design onto my tobacco pipe a couple of the tips broke. one broke, then i replaced it, and that one broke, then i replaced that one, and finally the next one broke off again but this time the bottom half of the tip got stuck inside the burner and there is no way to get it out or even attach any other tips because the broken one is stuck inside. now its just sitting in my garage not doing anything but wasting my money.thanks a lot you guys!"
4,Essential for that techno collection.,"I bought this CD used from a friend, and I feel it was one of the best cd's I have bought in a long time. WIth the mix of disco and techno this a an essential disc for any dance collectioin."
4,Interesting Observations,"Anyone interested in architecture or historical preservation would probably enjoy the observations and case studies in this book. Brand has a new, fascinating idea to examine what makes building livable, and to look at what happens to structures in the decades after they are built. Good thinking, and maybe this could be the beginning of a new area of architectural scholarship. Recommended!"
5,Foundation Changing,"Until reading this book (which I have only half devoured so far), my idea of preservation was returning a structure to its appearance as originally built. Brand makes a thoroughly persuasive argument for allowing buildings to retain those alterations they colllect over the years. The text is straight forward, engaging, the time progression pictures are fascinating. Overall, among my few favorite books about architecture, preservation, or human adaptability. Excellent."
2,Mr. Crankypants,"This is a good idea for a book. There is much to be criticized about architectural process & the industry. But what a chiding, morally superior, sneering repetitive text. While renewing respect for thoughtful old ways, the author lambasts easily pilloried eras and work with perfect (and perfectly unadventurous) 20/20 hindsight.This was a necessary chapter in the toppling of grey-utilitarian-modernism but, oh my! What a drag to read. And any insight is now buried under the boilerplate assumptions of the next architectural phases this kind of writing ushered in. Not timeless."
5,I read this book as a metaphor,The book is about buildings -- but read this as a metaphor and you'll see that he is also talking about how we change as a society. I read this book and thought about the computer industry -- how computer systems change as the learn about users. This is a clever book and informative. Read it with an open mind and you may find more than what is in the pages.
3,It's Okay.,The chain was too thin and it did not look like it was even a .7mm box chain and after searching for a thicker chain I found this one was much more expensive than it was worth.
5,Crazy cheap and good quality,I bought these because they were ridiculously cheap so I figured what's the risk? I read some review for the 50 pack (I think) that said they were poor quality and they arrived broken. Well I bought two packs of these jewel cases (because two 25 packs were cheaper than one 50 pack) and they arrived in perfect condition. I can't find anything wrong with them. My cat even pushed one off the desk and it didn't even break.
3,jewel cases,"A good price, but you get what you pay for in this life. These are a bit fragile and the ""hinges"" on some of the cases broke easily. Still worth the money over-all, I'd say."
3,Very thin and fragile,"These cases are very thin and fragile, but do provide protection for the CD's. They are not boxed, but wrapped in thin plastic. The first order came with many CD's cracked because it evidently bumped around in the shipping box. Amazon quickly replaced the order. The next ones weren't boxed well either, but they did arrive undamaged. I ended up making more use of the paper sleeves, which are much more cost effective."
4,JEWEL CASES DO THE WORK,These plastic cases do exactly what they are meant to do.HOLD AND PROTECT MY CD's AND DVD's. I am really pleased - price is good too! Thank you Amazon!
4,Not very well known but very good,"Demon Box is great for those who have read The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, One Flew Over the Coo Coo's Nest, and Sometimes A Great Notion and still want to hear more about Kesey. In the book, Kesey, as Devlin Debree, decribes his life after the Prankster days and gives insight into the failure of the 60's counter-culture."
4,Kesey's semi-autobiography,"Using Kerouac's technique of writing autobiographical fiction (the events may be true, but the names have been changed), Kesey presents DEMON BOX, a series of short shorties and vinettes depicting his life on his farm in Oregon.Relating a variety of experiences, ranging from scary hangers on to adventures with farm animals, and fallout from the drug haze of the '60's, Kesey vividly captures specific times and places. His humor, characterization and descriptions of geographical space (my native Oregon)all remain intact and on a level with his finest work.Some vinettes are obviously more memorable than others and often the writing seems unfocused and in need of editing.This is really a small matter considering that this is the closest to a autobiography the world will ever get. DEMON BOX certainly makes for a strong and worthwhile read."
3,A Collection of Kesey,This collection of short stories by Ken Kesey is readable but lacks the form of earlier works. For a Kesey reader it will delight and amuse.
5,Good value for the money,"The order arrived on time, well packed with no broken jewel case. Good value for the money."
4,Quantity vs quality,"You can't beat the price for the number of cases you get. However, out of the 100 cases, I think about 7-8 of mine were broken. While I was disappointed, I still think this pack is a good deal."
1,Fuji CD-R/FVD Slim Jewel Cas,Product arrived damaged. Company (ANTOnline)was unwilling to exchange for new item. Would never buy from them again.
2,A Bad Wrap,"The product is alright for what it costs, but I am really pissed by the packaging department. This item comes wrapped in brown paper instead of bubble wrap and at least 10 to 15 of the cases end up broken. I complained and the Amazon Customer Service people worked it out with me, but I STILL want for purchasers of this product to complain to customer service if you order this item and they come broken. That is the ONLY way something will be done about this Bad Wrapping."
5,Excellent low-price CD or DVD covers,"Unlike some of the other reviews have suggested, these covers came well-packaged and in perfect shape. No damage at all. They also seem to be a step up in quality from other inexpensive covers I've purchased in the past. The different colors supplied can be a useful for organizing discs. These are not super-rugged covers, nor were they designed to be, but they're great for compact storage and protection of a large number of discs."
4,Jewel cases,"I order these often, there are always at least three broken. Package isheavy and they move within packaging. However, I like ordering in bulk andthe price is good."
3,great product but broken cases,this is a great product especially for the price the only thing is that there were about 15 broken cases when i received the item... otherwise i recommend this because that many cases is not that big of a deal for the value that is offered and they are colored!@!!
1,NOT IN STOCK !!!!!!,"I ordered this item on January 19,2008. Even though this item is always in stock, I have yet to receive it. I keep getting E-mails telling me to wait another two weeks because it's not in stock!!!I don't get it. If it's not in stock then don't say it is in stock. Now I'm being asked to wait until April or May to receive it...maybe.This is very frustrating."
2,Cases Smell,"My Fuji CD-R/DVD Slim Jewel Cases arrived in good condition today, but they smell.The cases were packed in cardboard that had a strong moldy smell.I thought , no problem. Throw away the carton and end of problem. WRONG.Remove the cases from the inner cardboard and shrink wrap then end of problem. WRONG, they still smell.Lucky me, I ordered 2 cases of 100. I'll be smelling these jewel cases forever!"
5,Product is Excellent as usual!,Product is Excellent as usual! Products from Amazon are always delivered in exceptional condition due too the care they use in shipping.
3,"Dated, now, but still relevant.","The Lords of the Rings has long been a must-read for both critics and fans of the Olympic Movement. It's ironic in that the book now seems almost dated in its naivete. I know that these guys pulled together the whole Samaranch/Franco/Fascist connection, and, yes, the Club is pretty odious. However, prior to both Sarajevo and LA in 1984, The Games were on a real downhill slide. Samaranch is no saint, but he did show some real leadership (and perhaps some hypocrisy). But a room full of journalists sure as hell couldn't have done any better."
5,The Best Thrash Band,"Just another great album by Slayer. Slayer is a band you either love or hate. If you like this album then you will probably like all of their other albums except perhaps for 'Undisputed Attitude' because it's mostly punk cover songs. Slayer has always been consistant in style and quality: they just never sold out like other speed/thrash bands like Metallica, etc. Otherwise, every album by Slayer rocks and this one is just as great with songs like 'War Ensemble', 'Expendable Youth' and 'Dead Skin Mask.' The ultimate mosh band. Enjoy!"
5,Probably the best album..to date,This is probably the best slayer album released so far. It had killer riffs and lyrics which made it a great album.Each time they release an album it seems to be lacking compared to it.
3,Thrash......,"""Seasons in the Abyss,"" is definitely a whiplash on you back, ""War Ensemble"" cracks your skull with speed rifts and war lyrics. The dark lyrics of this album are tantamount to aggressive butt kickin you'll definitely enjoy!If you are a Slayer fan you would definitely enjoy this album."
4,This is SLAYER.. what more can I say,"Seasons in the Abyss was the first slayer song I ever heard (Yeah I cant belive that I missed reign in blood!!)Anyway, for some reason Seasons in the Abyss for me is the best thrash metal song ever.This album is not the fastest of all the slayer albums but definitly one of the heaviest. Blood red, Dead skin mask, Born of Fire and Seasons in the abyss have some of the greatest slayer riffs. This album stands out from the rest of slayer's albums in 2 aspects. The creepy solos prevelant all throught the album and the crazy screams of Tom Araya. The creepiness reaches its peek in Dead skin mask. The screaming at the end of Born of fire is breathtaking. The story teller kind of singing in Dead skin mask is simply superb."
4,Slayer,"Great price, great quality on a very hard to find anywhere product anywhere in the U.S. I loved it. Thanks again."
4,An experience,"I never thought Slayer was a great band until I saw them at Ozzfest. Since I already had some of their albums, I decided to give them a spin to see if they retained the power of Slayer's live show. Seasons of the Abyss stands out as my favorite Slayer release because of the consistency of the material. I also enjoy the lyrics; Gone are the almost cartoony yet oddly apropriate demonic lyrics and in are the lyrics that deal with the harsh realities of life. Slayer has really hit a nail with these lyrics because they do not seem forced; You can hear the sincerity of Tom Araya's vocals. The instruments are in top from here, particularly, Dave Lombardo's amazing drumwork. He is definitely an underappreciated drummer. Rick Rubin has given the band some amazing production, since it accentuates all of Slayer's best parts. Seasons in the abyss is an amazing album. For fans of heavy metal, this one is worth listening to. Consider giving it a try; You be surprised to hear how good it is."
5,I miss old slayer !,"I realy do miss the days of old slayer because al of their latest realses seems kinda disapointing and boring. This is an amazing performance by slayer and it is worth every cent. My favorite song ? ""dead skin mask"" by far the most brutal song on here. Buy it !"
4,essential album,this was my 1st Slayer album at 1st i saw it as a masterpeice but after hearing Reign In Blood i have changed my mind. This is an awesome album. And als an essential album for any metal fan. There really isnt much to say that hasnt already been said here.
3,should be 4 stars,"i dont know why but for a while i disliked this album. ive given it another chance, and i really like it. its a lot more melodic than reign in blood and each band member shines. dave lombardo displays some excellent drumming here while Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman slow their riffs down a bit but still can play like hell. great pickup if your a fan of slayer or darker metal"
5,BEST SLAYER ALBUM. SIMPLE AS THAT,"This is the best SLAYER album. Even with so much praise being given upon REIGN IN BLOOD, SEASONS... is better, simply because the players are more mature, the songs are well ""designed"", the furious in the right proportion. I jus tlove this album, never imagined it could be so good. COming after SOUTH OF HEAVEN (another masterpiece), SEASONS portrays SLAYER at their definitive best."
3,Slayer in a decline....,"This album is full of recycled, tired, and overused riffs, and vocally is about as boring as you get. While tunes like ""War Ensemble"", ""Dead Skin Mask"", ""Hallowed Point"", the title track, and ""Born of Fire"" seriously rock, several of the songs sound like outtakes and not thought out, especially like ""Expendable Youth"" and ""Blood Red"", two almost identical songs which remind me of the Stones on steroids. Overall, this album was a severe let-down after the masterpiece South of Heaven, which is legions better. This, in my opinion, is Slayer's worst album, and while it's decent, it is nowhere near along the lines of Reign, South, Divine, or Hell...I don't recommend this one for a new Slayer fan."
2,Weak Vocals????,"I Love Slayer but for some reason I can't get into this album..The cd does have two of the best Slayer songs ever..War Ensemble and Seasons In The Abyss( which sound much more aggressive on the live album) ..but the rest of the album is just weak.Its like they tried to mix south of heaven with reign in blood but it just didn't work..I guess its Tom's new singing style..I wish he would go back to the old reign in blood , hell awaits style.."
2,"Eh, ok","I felt this album was a low point for Slayer. In a sense its like Metallicas Black album. I tend to forget about these minor setbacks in their careers. Seasons in the abyss was too mellow from a Slayer fan standpoint, I was hoping for something that kept in the lines of Slayers notorious, relentless song writing and brutal guitar riffs. This album was more of a whimper. It just doesn't do much for me at all. Its like just when you thought the lyrics were going to get good, someone was tapping them on the shoulder ""saying tone it down guys we can't have another reign in blood album style lyric"" . I like brutal Slayer music period and this isn't it!"
2,An OK Slayer Release,"This is a pretty decent Slayer release, it sort of bridged the gap between the old school (Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Hell Awaits era) with what was to come, the more non-satanic Divine Interention, Diobolus in Musica, and God Hates Us All Albums.As a Satanist since 1981 when Venom's ""Black Metal"" was released, I found Seasons in the Abyss to be dissapointing in that Satan was only mentioned in ""Born of Fire"" and ""Temptation"", apprarently only at the insistence of Rick Rubin. I prefer the more satanic and evil earlier material Slayer has, such as Hell Awaits and Show no Mercy. From a heavy metal standpoint, however, this is a good introduction to what Slayer has to offer."
5,Metal At It's Best,"Slayer is one of the best heavy metal bands, and it truly shows in this album. abyss is ass heavy as j.lo's ass when soaking wet....yes its that heavy, so this is a definite must buy, no mistake. slayer is one of the top metal acts ever next to pantera!"
3,"Disappointing, for Slayer...","This has always been my least favorite Slayer album. Too many throwaway tracks, I can't stand the hippie vocals on ""Expendable Youth"" and ""Blood Red""...tried to hard to recreate South of Heaven..."
3,Mediocre,"Overall, this album isn't great. Musically, it's all good, but lyrically, it's ""cliché metal"" all the way, with the title track leading the way in cheesiness. ""War Ensemble"", ""Spirit In Black"" (excellence), ""Hallowed Point"", ""Born Of Fire"" and ""Seasons In The Abyss"" are the standouts here; however, there is ""Expendable Youth"", which is really only good on the ""Decade Of Aggression"" album, and ""Blood Red"", which is quite possibly the worst song ever recorded by any band. Good thing ""Divine Intervention"" came next, and snapped them out of their funk..."
5,the best Slayer album,"This is Slayer's best album, combining some great thrash songs and some more melodic slow songs. This is an album I'll love until the day I die.1. War Ensemble 10/10 great thrash song, classic2. Blood Red 6/10 nothing special3. Spirit in Black 8/10 pretty good4. Expendable Youth 9/10 another good song5. Dead Skin Mask 10/10 creepy, but cool6. Hallowed Point 9/10 great thrash7. Skeletons of Society 7/10 not bad8. Temptation 6/10 nothing special9. Born of Fire 6/10 "" ""10. Seasons in the Abyss 10/10 great song"
2,Not their second best by any stretch.,"Like I said about South of Heaven: a lame attempt to sound relevant, poetic, and evolved. But much of it sounds even more strained and out-of-character than SOH. Slightly more thrashy than SOH, but not in a good way.They got rid of the cheezy monster-movie riffs which plagued SOH. But they kept the dull, whiny vocals. I guess Tom needed a few years to rest his voice after Reign In Blood.On the plus side, ""Hallowed Point"" and ""Born of Fire"" are classic Slayer--more or less... ""War Ensemble""--a fan favorite for some reason--is awkward, as if they tried too hard to sound edgy, aggressive, and political.If you're new to Slayer, I recommend their pre-SOH material, especially RIB. If you're a hard-core fan after hearing RIB, or just curious, go ahead and try this, as you might agree with other fans who say this is their second best album.Songwriting: 5/10Musicianship: 8/10Sound Quality: 7/10Originality: 5/10Listenability: 3/10"
2,Their worst I've heard so far,"After Slayer produced Reign in Blood, arguably the best metal album of all time, I guess they could go no further in that direction, and produced South of Heaven, a mediocre album that has some good songs, and some bad songs. I suspect that they tried to be more like Metallica with South of Heaven, in order to get into the mainstream rock culture and sell more albums. Some reviews say South of Heaven was their worst album of that period, but it's significantly better then Seasons in the Abyss. There are only a few decent songs on this album, and the rest sounds very tired and poorly produced. Slayers live album, Decade of Aggression actually brings to life some of the songs on this album, and I recommend getting that CD first and see if you like those songs. The title track is not bad, but unless you have heard it before and really like it, this album isn't worth getting."
3,Sounds good in a bad way,"Slayer is ok, I remember seasons in the abyss playing on headbangers ball and to me was no more better then when they played Overkill or Sepultura. The songs to me that really are decent are tracks 3,4,5,7 and 10. The rest of the songs to me are just thrash speed metal. I can find lots of influences from other bands in these songs and their album-- but to me the group stands on line with Pentagram. The riffs to me are nearly identical in tempo and style. They talk about black obscure spooky things. The lead singer is good and appreciate the way he expresses his voice in the songs mentioned. The irish are tending to be masters of black realmed music beginning with Pentagram, Slayer, Tool. But then again this is USA you cannot capture what you can let go."
1,DARK SEASON...,"This CD is so bad that I can't understand why a band like this survives so long, fed by fans who think they are ""different"" or ""radical"". Ok, they're just skilless."
1,MUSIC IN THE ABYSS..,"Ok, let's supoose Slayer is a good metal band. Why the singer can't sing at all? WHy Hanneman and King (ercognized by their own fans) can't make a good solo at all? WHy Dave Lombardo left the band? THis is garbage."
1,Eternal season in the lake of fire!,Yeah! Do you really want to go hell?Listen to this cd and you'll know what kind of music demons likes to play. Of course you are burning all the time and can't see no one there. You are just alone with the beast.
4,A darn good thrashin' time,"Seasons in the Abyss follows more or less in the footsteps of the previous South of Heaven, by blending ultra-fast speed metal with some more moderate material. This time, the songwriting holds up better. All of it is good, with a variety of heavy sounds coming between 'War Ensemble' (the blistering opener) and the closing title track, which is doom-laden and atmospheric. Despite having all this in favor of it, Seasons can't quite top their 1986 classic Reign in Blood. Perhaps it's just that Slayer were better at playing fast than anything else, and the slower material just can't be as convincing. Be that as it may, this is considered by many to be the last great Slayer album and is a fine addition to anybody's metal library."
4,Got to be the most -underrated band in metal today,"I can still remember the first time I heard this album, at my friend Brett's place- drunk as hell, thinking my god that is the heaviest guitar tone ive ever heard!! Years later and im still knocked out by this Metal masterpiece!!Absolutely stoked to hear that this is getting re-released, hopefully now the masses can enjoy it and get knocked on there ass just like me.I remember ""Psychotic Reaction"" getting voted one of the heaviest songs of all time in Guitar World a few years back, and apart from that have heard nearly nothing about these guys in the press- downright criminal. Of course we get to hear all about Lars Ulrich's underpants,or FredDurst's razor selection.....who cares!!! grow some riffs you guys!!Anyway buy this album if you can find it, its just THAT SIMPLE."
5,THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER!!!!,THIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME. DARK AND GLOOMY. HARD AND HEAVY. BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE I HAVE EVER HEARD! AND I HAVE HEARD THEM ALL. I HAVE LOST A COUPLE OF COPIES AND HAVE PAID ALL KINDS OF MONEY TO REPLACE THIS ONE! BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT! WORTH ANY PRICE!!
5,OUTSATNDING!!!,"Only topped by the follow up... This is when it all came together and lay the ground work for Manic Frustration, their absolute masterpiece."
1,False Advertising,"When you get the box it has the exact same picture as above except that on the box picture it says ""food not included"". They photoshopped that part out above in the hopes that people like me wouldnt read the description thoroughly to see that it only includes the pots, pans, and utensils. Without the food there are ALOT better priced sets on amazon. Dont settle for this one because for the price (without the food) its not worth it. Also the pots and pans are miniature size so think the size of bowls and saucers."
1,PICTURE IS MISREPRESENTATIVE,"Picture FALSELY REPRESENTS what comes in this set. None of the food items are included, even though they appear in the picture. If you buys this, you will only get about half of what you think you are getting, based on the picture."
2,I was disappointed.,I bought this as a gift for my 21/2 yr. old grandaughter. It was to go with the kitchen her parents purchased for her. I was highly disappointed as it was much smaller than shown. I bought a much better set for half the price at my local grocery store! I will definitely be sending this one back!
3,Cute but not well designed,"I bought this for my 3yo daughter, who is my little assistant chef for nearly every meal! She absolutely loves this set! But as her mother, I think this set could have been better designed. First, the frying pan does not sit ""flat on the pan."" The handle weighs more than the pan, so you have to eitehr put something in the pan to weigh it down or hold it. Second, the ""pressure cooker"" lid is difficult for a young child to put on. They can eventually learn this, but it's frustrating. (It must be lined up and twisted into place.) My (newly) 3yo is quite intelligent and is ahead in all of her motor skills, but still can barely put the lid on by herself. I guess she'll have it down in a couple of weeks. And third, the lids to the frying pan and medium size pot are almost the same size. Again, this results in frustration for the child trying to put the lid on the pot. So while this is marketed for young children, it is not well designed for a young child to use."
3,These are small,"I was shocked at the quality of this toy for $40! The parts are small, (The biggest pot is about 6"" across.) and made of fairly cheap plastic. The lids do fit the pots and the utensils are size appropriate, tho. It did have a variety of utensils, which most such sets do not, but I was surprised at the smallness and ""cheapness"" of it for the price."
5,my daughter loves her new cookware set!,so my 2 year old daughter is really into cooking! So this was an easy gift for her! she absolutely loves her set!!! i recommend it for any kid! the size of the set is perfect and the colors are soft and nice!
1,Disappointing,This cook set is ridiculously expensive! The plastic lids don't fit properly on the pots...and especially troublesome is the stock pot lid. It is very difficult to twist it so the edges go under the handles to keep the lid on. i can't believe that the set is even more money than i paid for it last year. believe me...this set is definitely not worth the money. sorry that I purchased it.
3,Decent pots,"My son really likes the utensils that come with this package. however, the skillet does not balance on its own. It falls over due to the weight of the handle. The rest of the pots are ok. They are small but the kitchen we bought is very small, so it works out ok. I am going to look at getting some other pots/pans at Ikea. All in all, it's ok but not amazing. And as everyone else has said, the food does not come with."
5,cookware set,"I bought this little cookware set for my grand daughter's Easter basket. She was ""cooking"" jelly beans for hours! She is only four, and NOT easy on things; this set is standing up to her ""use"" very well and she's really enjoying it. Also, my order arrived in plenty of time for the holiday as promised. I will order again should the occasion arise."
5,Cookware Set,My daughter loves this cooking set. It is very Safe! Goes well with any toy kitchen set. Made well. All Plastic. AAA+++
4,Good Base Kitchen Set,"Good overall set. Cheap plastic, but good enough for my 2 year old! Held up so far! He loves it!"
3,Very cheaply made,"Product is very small and very disappointed in how cheap it looks and feels, seems like something I could get at Walmart for at least half the price!"
3,Missing Parts,The cookware set is nice. However it was missing the frying pan and lid. The picture also shows food which the set did not contain.
1,Need a ZERO star rating!,"Thirty dollars for this? You have got to be kidding! What a joke and what a rip-off!! I will be returning this ""crap"" because my child's hand is bigger than the skillet! YOU people should be ashamed to put this out there! And take the food off the picture if it isn't included!"
2,Cookware Much Too Small,"I bought this cookware for my 3-year-old grandaughter, who was completely disinterested in the toy. For a start, the pots and pans are too small to actually ""pretend cook"" with. I also bought another item from Small World Living Toys; plastic veggies, that I assumed were shown with the cooking set. In the photo, it shows several vegetables in one pot. In reality, you could hardly fit one vegetable into the pot. The pots are extremely small. I would have returned it, but it was a gift for her birthday. Maybe her one-yr-old brother will play with it."
3,Decent set- knife a little dangerous.,"This is a pretty good set of pots and pans... the only problem I have with it is that the ""knife"" that it comes with seems a little dangerous for a kid if she/he is running around with it, so I took it away, but the rest of the set is cute. Also, it does not come with any food (despite what it shows in the picture)."
1,Photo deceptive and illegal!,"The product photo illustrates food comes with the set, IT DOES NOT. You only find this out after purchasing and finding this in the very fine print hidden on the outside of the box in colors that blend in with the label!!! Very cruel and expensive for what you get!!"
3,Very cute very small,"The items are very cute. The tools that the product package came with seem like a great size for little hands (2-4year old). The pots and pan, however, are very small. I would say the width of the biggest pot is about 5 1/2 inches. I would have liked to have known how small they were before buying them. I feel for the price I could have bought something at Toys R us that was larger (and able to fit multiple play food items in it. The play food items we have are a little more real size than miniature. If you have fairly small play food this set would probably be great.Prompt delivery, and well packaged."
3,It's Okay,Was a little cheaper in quality than I expected. Wish that the pans could nest better for storage. Grandkids are enjoying it but can't see this lasting until my youngest little man is ready to use.
4,"Cute, but...","I should have read more reviews before purchasing this product. Only after it arrived did I realize that all of the food pictured all over the box is actually NOT included! In hindsight, that explains the really good price. My toddler still loves the pots and pans. She just needed to wait longer for the ""fruits & vegetables"" to show up. :)"
2,Much smaller than it looks,Total box is smaller than a shoe box - not worth the money - I thought it would be much bigger than it is...
4,Star wars at-at,This was a gift for my son to add to his many star wars toys. He loves it and can even fit Lego people into it.
3,Maruerite de Valois,I decided to read Dumas's works - as much as was available on Kindle. This is one of a series. It was interesting. It originally was part of a series of magazine/paper stories that Dumas wrote regarding historical and fictional people leading up to the French Revolution. Probably his most famous work was the Three Musketters
1,Shirley deserves better,"Bad Sound ,Great Album Shirley desrves better than this one of her great 70s albums the sound is full of hiss not much better than a cassette tape sound this CD was realeased in 2003 made in portugal ,being a huge shirley fan i grabbed this at the time to be dissapointed ,But in 2005 BGO records released this as a twofer with album Good Bad & Beautiful remasterd sound this is the one to buy just great , this version is the pitts why the consumer is subjected to poor quality if its cheap ok but in some cases the price is not reflected in the product this is an example of that ."
2,Something's gotta give,"From what I've heard, Michael isn't in step with or ahead of the crowd. I'm not saying this is bad. I'm saying he doesn't quite grab and to speak to a large enough common denominator in us...yet. I'm thinkin' he needs to get his heart broke real well a time or two (or three), lose faith in a friend, let a friend down, and embarrass himself severely publicly. Maybe then he'll be ready to speak and sing better to the dreams, desires, disturbances and disappointments that make up Human existence. I liked 'Her Doorway' and 'Ho hum' some. I think all the tunes need a bit of surgery in the form of soul or spicy individuality. I hope he finds his light."
4,Flashbacks to Freshman Year,"Oh my god. This album -- unbelievably hilarious. My friends and I used to listen to this in 9th grade, reciting in staccato bravado ""If A Girl Answers, Don't Hang Up"" -- and I just downloaded this song, honestly haven't heard it in probably 20 years, and it is even BETTER and more HYSTERICAL than it was in 9th grade...And -- I can't believe I never noticed this, but I think it is Prince acting as the other woman when the girls call ""Jimmy's"" house to get a ride to the party!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF?????? and THAT makes it SCREAMINGLY funny. 20 years later, close to my 40s, and I still get a kick out of this. That is why they call them ""classics"" - timeless in their appeal. Can anyone confirm if it is Prince?"
5,I ALSO NEED A COPY OF THIS CAN SOMEONE HELP ME ALSO??,"Let me tell those of you that dont already know. This was one of her best. My favorite cut is (if a girls answers..dont hang up) you all really need to listen to the lyrics, they are off the hook....(GLENNMACK37@HOTMAIL.COM)"
1,Vanity is now Evangelist Denise Matthews,The artist formally known as Vanity 6 is now an ordained minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Vanity 6 is dead but Sister Matthews lives to declare the glory of God!!!!!!!!
2,Cheap looking-Not worth it even at the discount,The yellow band accross these make the sunglasses look cheap. Even at the discount price--I would pass on these.
2,"Nice case, shame about the glasses","As is often the case with ""designer"" goods, I think it probably cost more in raw materials to make the super cool case for these sunglasses, than for the sunglasses themselves.They are feather light, have the feel of a pair you would find in a higher-end Walgreens, and yield a pretty poor image when worn.We were lucky enough to pick these up on the cheap. For 30 bucks, they're value - the case is at least. For MSRP, there's better out there."
3,Average to me,"I have read much about this product and so I had to try it. After doing so, I do not feel the difference that I have heard others comment on. One thing though is that it does not have a bad taste or smell, like other vitamins. I just did not feel a difference with them."
1,No Battery Life. No phonebook sharing!!,"I bought this phone without reading any reviews. Big mistake. The phone does not hold any charge for any logical duration. The battery dies before you get the chance to put it back on the charger. Also, the handsets (I have 3) do not share the phonebook numbers. You have to enter each and every number again for all the handsets. In adition, the voicemail light is always on and the phone display says I have voicemail while I don't. You erase the message and it comes back after you get a missed call. The phone looks nice and sleek but is not worth it!!"
2,This phone annoys me,"I wish I had returned this phone. The things that annoy me APART from the phone book are: no warning that the battery is about to die, a very annoying ringing tone when another call is coming in, the fact that when you program names into the phone book and that person calls in they are identified by number only, not name AND you cannot press last number like you can with panasonic as it doesn't put the '1' in front... that is really really annoying! Pretty phone but I wish I had stuck with Panasonic."
2,Pretty Phone; But!,"I had this phone for 3 weeks, yes it has good sound quality and very easy to read LED. Problem #1 was I had phone in bedroom and with the answer on and set to lowest volume(off) phone ringer off there was still a click to be heard. Only a problem for those that work late and would like some peace while they sleep.Problem #2 and the biggest was that my phone would take 20-24 hours to charge and would only last 12 hours before it needed charging again! I did email support and they said it was in need of replacement.Problem #3 is after having for 3 weeks this small phone seemed fragile to me. How many of us have dropped a phone? This phone would not survive many drops, believe me.I replaced it with another brand. Panasonic TG1032S, so far I pleased with it and review as I have had it less than 1 week.After researching cordless phones I have found that there is NO perfect phone. If Vtech would have charged properly I would maybe have kept it."
1,Pretty but practically useless,"I was bowled over by the elegant looks of the V-Tech phone. I eagerly set it up and began using the phone. The sound was reasonably good, but I quickly ran into my first problem. I wanted to enter phone numbers in the directory. What a disaster!-- I could not edit either the number or the name during entry! What an amazing oversight!-- After laboring to enter a dozen numbers into the phone, I looked for the button to transfer them into the other handsets. Nope! YOU HAVE TO ENTER THEM IN ALL OVER AGAIN!I have always preferred V-Tech phones but this one finally broke me of the habit. I can't believe how they could screw up such a design."
1,"1st Phones ""Defective""--Replacement Phones ""Defective""","I liked my original VTech cordless phones for about two days. Then I discovered that they had not been signaling with a ring when I had incoming calls. Manufacturer did ""Troubleshoot"" and deemed the phones defective. I returned the phones and, unfortunately, requested a new set of the same product. The replacement VTech phones stopped signaling incoming calls after about ten minutes. I returned those and requested a refund. What a waste of my time! I purchased a Panasonic phone system locally and it is great."
1,Not a good phone,"We were initially very pleased with these phones, they worked quite well the first few months (or so we thought), although we did notice a shorter battery life than our previous cordless phones (although not as extreme as others have reported). They would hold a charge for few days with moderate use.However, within the last few months we've found that the sound quality has gone to crap (or maybe always was). The phones cut in-and-out, but only the out-going sound. So we, the users, don't notice it. We often talk to others who are on their cell phones and I think they just assumed since they had called our home number that it was their cellular service. One of the handsets is worse than the other, and it occurs even with a full charge on the battery, so it's not due to that.I printed off and followed about a 20 item trouble-shooting list from Vtech's website, but all it did was prove these phones are crap. Don't buy them."
2,Dead batteries,"I bought several of these phones so I could outfit my whole house with interchangeable portable phones. Not a single one of them has lasted, and I'm now faced with the choice of replacing all of their batteries, or the phones themselves. To make matters worse, dialing is very slow on these phones. Will probably be the last Vtech I buy for a while.PROS:-It looks coolCONS:-Zero battery life, unusable after a few months-Slow dialing!"
1,I should have read the reviews before buying.,"This is a nicely packaged, good looking phone, but totally unusable. After setting it up, I called the number from my cell phone. It rang three times, the answering machine picked up, and that is the last time it worked correctly. Thinking it was the one unit, I returned it to Amazon for a replacement. Same problem with the replacement. Bad engineering I guess."
1,Horrible phone! No battery life. Do not waste your money,They may look pretty but they are horrible phones. The battery life is ridiculous. If it is left off of the hook overnight it is dead. The phone books are not shared but I could get past that if the phone ever worked! Because the battery is constantly dead its worthless. Don't waste your money.
1,"12.5 Months After Purchase, Base Died","This phone system was functional for the first 12.5 months after we bought it. It seemed to me like it was just waiting for the warranty to run out before the base died, though! About two weeks after the warranty ended (i.e. one year after we purchased it), the base station became completely non-responsive. I tried their website's troubleshooting steps (unplug it, remove batteries, wait five minutes, then put it all back together) to no avail.There is NO outside-warranty support whatsoever, so we're without a home phone until we buy another one.Since this is the second vtech cordless phone we've had where this has happened to us, we will not be buying anything else from this company!"
2,New Age Dud,The phones did not work when I received them. To avoid time and return postage I went to a local store to purchase another set. Of the new set one of the batteries did not work. After switching out the batteries I finally got the phones to work. The phones are stylish and look good. The only issue I have is the choice of ring tones and volume. Three of the tones sound exactly the same and all the tones leaves a lot to be desired. The volume level only goes to five and with the tones that sounds the best you can barely hear the ringing. The rep that came to hook up my service told me that one of the homes he went to the day before had the same phones and they did not work....
2,cordless phone,"The clarity is good, phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, but the battery life leaves a lot to be desired. We returned the first one because it was only holding a charge for 3-4 hours. Our replacement only holds the charge for about 8 hours, less if it gets used. Not very good for the nights we forget to charge it overnight. If the battery life was longer this would be a great phone. One other complaint is that there is no speaker phone on the base unit, which is helpful when your 4 year old hides the handset again and you have an important call coming in."
1,Horrible phone!,The phone goes dead very quickly and needs a new battery after just a short time of owning it. Not worth a single penny that you pay for it!
2,Battery Life is Horrendous,"Everything about this phone and answering system works fine except for one glaring, painful, fatal flaw: battery life is absolutely terrible. It starts out mediocre and gets worse from there. and And AND! the retailers who carry the phone DO NOT CARRY THE BATTERIES. This is a uniquie little double AAA battery that they did not have at Radio Shack or Walmart (where the phone itself was on display) and it was not at either of the two battery stores I visited. One of the battery stores finally saved me and made me a new battery, reusing the connector.I bought this phone because the old one wouldn't stay charged out of the base for more than an hour. NOw I'm in the same spot I was before with a more expensive phone."
2,Looks can deceive you!!,I bought this phone falling for its cool design.But this phone is not functional. The battery life is awful. It just fails without adequate warning.Also the phone menu design is also not good compared to panasonic phones. I think the Engineers who designed this phone need to do better.I can forgive the menu design. But I cannot forgive the battery life issues. This makes this phone a failure.I have a much older panasonic which gives me much better battery life.I have decided to stick only with panasonics in the future and will not recommend vtech phones to anyone.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY-- WON'T LAST 6 MONTHS,"Oh, I wish I had read these reviews before I paid $90 for this!! Within 6 months the handsets started losing charge. I thought for a while it was that I wasn't letting it charge long enough but even after charging them for a whole day I get maybe 2 calls out of it and it dies EVEN when the battery indicator says it has charge. Grrrr.. So frustrating! And my service contract (not thru Amazon) won't cover it saying it's the batteries. Don't buy this phone. Not worth the aggravation!"
1,Don't do it,"Don't do it! The phone seems like it would be great, features are nice, think handset, HOWEVER, it does not hold a charge. From the very beginning this phone only provided about 1/2 hour talk time before I had to put it on the charger. Even when I wasn't talking on it but it was left off the charger for minimal time it would die, both handsets gave the same problem. Also, it doesn't have speaker on the base of the phone so when I would lose a call I couldn't even save it by talking on the base speaker."
1,BAD Tech,"VTech 6042 is a VERY Bad phone. The Dect technology seems to be over the head of VTech in it's first Dect phones. The phone will stop signaling incoming calls after 1 hour. The return process with Amazon is very good though. The first phone failed after a day, I called VTech (VTech HQ only 20 mi. from my house, Big plus I thought then!) Not much help there, so I returned phone to Amazon for an instant replacement. Replacement phone had the same problem. I called VTech support again & finally found out that ""Version 1's"" had a LOT of these problems & Amazon does not have Version 2. (and VTech NOT pulling Vers. 1 off the market, WHY NOT?) I was then told to ship phone to the Texas service/support center for replacement (at MY expense) with a Version 2 model which would take 4 to 6 weeks, No Thanks, I returned it to Amazon for a full refund. Onward to different Brand/Manufacturer. Oh Well!"
2,Disappointed!,VTech 6042 DECT 6.0 Two-Handset Cordless Phone System with Digital Answering Device and Caller IDI will never order this item again. The phone lasted just over a year before it started going out in the middle of a conversation. Completely unreliable.There are an absurd number of steps to enter phone numbers -- you shouldn't have to go through but a couple of steps and it should be easy to flip through the list of calls received in order to do so.I had used this phone for a month while visiting my brother and ordered it because I was so impressed.I will not recommend it. And at that price I could buy two sets of the Panasonic that I bought as a replacement
5,"Clear sound, great design",Just bought this phone and I love it! The sound is exceptional. The phone itself is very thin (about 1/2 inch) but is quite usable. The buttons for dialing are flat - like a touchscreen almost. It's feels modern and makes most other phones look clunky.
5,Awesome phone and very reasonably priced!,This has amazing clarity and superior sound quality especially for its price! Very sleek and modern. One of the best speaker phones I've heard as well.
2,Great phone but battery life is awful!,I loved everything about the phone but if you leave it off the hook overnight its dead -- battery life is the worst i've seen. I ended up returning the phone even though I like everything else about it.
1,Do not buy this phone! The battery *will* die,"I bought this phone because VTech had a good phone reputation and it looked pretty cool, like the original Moto Razr.This phone battery will die and you can read all the reviews about how if you can get to customer support they'll explain how to reset the phone so it will provide a full charge but nothing deals with the fact that the battery and/or charging system is so completely inadequate that we should all be getting our money back.I was really STUPID not to return this ASAP, I just thought I had to stop leaving it out of the cradle. I was wrong, you can't even leave the phone off the charger overnight once!Eventually, one of the phone's simply would reset/die if you turned on the speakerphone.DO NOT BUY ANY VTECH DECT 6.0 PHONE MODEL that looks like this."
3,It is OK,The phones look really nice and are easy to use. I have not talked long on them but have noticed that after using it for a few minutes and put it back on the base it show it charging which I would not expect for the amount of time it was used. Have not run out of battery yet. My favorite is being able to check messages when not home.
1,No Battery Life,"Let me first say that I initially LOVED this phone, however - don't buy this phone! We've had it for less than a year and the charge that it will hold gets less and less every day. We're down to less than five minutes when not cradled. I'm currently replacing this phone!"
1,Dont Buy!,Will never buy another product from this company again. Have owned for 5 months and just threw in trash today.
1,this phone is garbage,first off i think any great reviews of this phone are phony. the reception fades in and out constantly even if your right next to the base.the battery life is abysmal. the only good thing about this phone is the sleek design. the phone quite frankly is garbage.
5,On the Edge,"This video rips. The drivers are the best in the world. No other motor sport does what these drivers do. In car and out of car camera coverage awesome. 100mph on glare ice, full throttle power slides around switch backs and the occasional swapping of paint with bark makes for lots of rewinds. If you think your pretty good in the winter with the fish tails, you have got to see these guys."
4,Easy to understand,"Though a little bit dated (published in 1999) this is a great little book for those people who just are getting the hang of Email to those who just want a bit of a refresher course. It's not overly long, it's easy to read and gives little snippets of ""real"" people experience as they adapt Emailing to their every day needs, be it at home or at work.Joan Tunstall has managed to make a boring subject interesting, with pratical hints, tips and ideas on how to get the most out of Emailing without it taking over your life. There are nine chapters to browse through, and you can either go through the entire book or you can skip through it to find what you want. As someone once said to me about using electronic mail, ""It ain't Rocket Science, but you've got to know the basics.""A good cheap reference source that might not be the most up-to-date book on your shelf but it could be a useful tool to have on hand just in case."
4,"Decent collection, but not Bradbury's best","I have read many sci-fi short stories, and by far Bradbury's are often my favorites. This collection though, I consider sub par. It is jumbled and some of the stories aren't even sci-fi are seem out of place. The collection has many great stories, but I don't recommend it to people new to Bradbury; if you haven't read ""The Illustrated Man"", I suggest it over this collection."
3,"Well-written, but maybe dated?","The edition I read had 18 stories, but by the end that felt like plenty to me. Bradbury's certainly a fine writer, but like that other renown master of the short form, Borges, he totally fails to engage me. I guess it's all a matter of taste, but the stories in this collection felt rather dated, and that's probably why I didn't enjoy them that much. Many of the stories raise questions about what it is to be human, and the intersection of humanity and the technology humans create to mimic humanity. And while they're moderately effective (especially the one about the robot grandmother), once you've read Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,"" everything else tends to pale in comparison. So, not my cup of tea, but that's just me."
5,Start Here,"I believe Amazon listed the tracks to the video. Actual list: Twist of Cain - Not of this World - She Rides - Soul on Fire - Am I Demon - Mother - Possession - End of Time - The Hunter - Evil Thing. Danzig II is more consistent, but this has a handful of their best songs. Start Here."
5,I hate to tell you this...,"This is a great Danzig album. Its one of the two I was willing to buy because the lyrics weren't satanic. Unfortunatly you guys at Amazon.com have the tracks wrong. Danzig has 10 tracks, and no intro or end title theme, or whatever you put. Get it right!"
4,guitar,"I like the guitar way out in front like on this album. & a fresh voice in metal @ the time. Commercially sound,but also underground feel.it is a love hate kinda thing.if u don't already know this band is heavy into the macabre."
3,Danzig's memorable debut,"From the ashes of failed 1980s band Samhain rose the eponymously named Danzig. This first album is a robust collection of blues-flavored hard rock centered around Glenn's stirring vocals and crunchy John Christ guitar riffs. Not a lot of variation here from song to song; each song boasts a fairly simple riff and the expected sing-a-long Danzig lyrics about death and murder. Despite that, the album is delightfully non-pretentious, and the whole thing clocks in barely past the 40-minute mark, so it doesn't have time to wear out its welcome. And just like in his punk days with the Misfits, Glenn has a keen understanding of pop music; these songs may be heavy and dark, but they're also darn catchy. One listen and you'll be humming half of these tunes in the shower, in the car or at work."
4,Keeping music evil,"Former Misfits and Samhain singer Glenn Danzig turned out this solo self titled debut which found the perfect melody and mix of blues and metal. From the awesome and catchy opener ""Twist of Cain"", which will have you banging your head in no time, to the blusey ""She Rides"", ""Am I Demon"", and the popular rocker ""Mother"", this album found Danzig and his crew (including former Samhain bassist Eerie Von, guitarist John Christ, and drummer Chuck Biscuits) still a little rough around the edges, but the band would get better as the album's progressed (the best Danzig album by far is ""Danzig 3: How the Gods Kill"") and Glenn's voice never sounded better up until this album. If you've never listened to any of Danzig's solo work, or if you like a little blues influence with your metal, then check this out."
5,The first in a long line of great Danzig albums!,"This is one great album. All these songs capture Glenn's horrific voice and tortured soul from the fast guitars of ""Twist of Cain"" to the slow evil lyrics of ""Posession"". Any metal fan will adore this wonderful album and embrace it for a long time. This album is most famous for Danzig's most popular song ""Mother"" but in my eyes it isn't even close to his best. All those people who love the song ""Mother"" I encourage you to set both feet in the darkness and go deaper into the world of Danzig!"
3,A good album,"I like listening to this debut album from Danzig from time to time. It was released in 1988, and ten songs are contained. Glenn Danzig also has a good voice. The musicianship is solid, and all of the tunes are listenable. The music sounds like straight-up rock--it reminds me of AC/DC. ""Twist of Cain,"" ""Mother,"" and ""Possession"" are the cuts that I consider to be the standouts. What I like about ""Twist of Cain"" is its infectious guitar riff and memorable refrain. I consider ""Mother"" to be a classic composition; an example of why is Danzig's unforgettable vocal performance. ""Possession"" is also a cool one that has a strange intro. The CD booklet has the song lyrics and a color photo of the group. Also, the disc is almost 41 minutes. This is a recommendable album."
4,Good stuff,"Gotta appreciate Danzig doing what they (he) does. Nicely done record, with the original version of ""Mother"" on it. This came out in the late 80's, and was clearly pushing ahead, past the hair metal bands and the speed metal stuff. Great for any Danzig fan, and a good introduction for any aspiring Danzing fan."
4,Danzig...its not your father's rock band or is it?,"This album is like AC/DC, Black Sabbath,the Cult w/Jim Morrison-type vocals and you get DANZIG! The songs are very classic rockish(the CD is over 20 years old so I guess it is now).If you like your music heavy and stipped down to the basics, this one is worth a listen! I feel as if Im going to Hell just listening to the lyrics."
4,Classic...,"Elvis lives... he sold his soul to Satan and is now known as Danzig! What a classic gem this CD is, right from the first song it grabs you by the throat with a 1-2 combo of hooks and riffs. This ain't your modern day screaming metal (which I happen to enjoy very much), this guy actually sings and sings pretty good. He sounds like Elvis and Danny Joe Brown (Molly Hatchet) and that other guy, what's his name? Oh yeah Lucifer. Great classic metal from back in the day."
4,Quite Good!,Well...Bini and Martini are one of the Low-profile duo...but thid album can really be mixed well in the nightclubs!!! In the Mix is a mustbuy!!! Chk this out!
3,A video of the film from a TV set,"The quality of this rather expensive video is very poor, as if someone videotaped the original from a TV screen and made copies. Shows up like the movie, ""Multiplicity,"" where Michael Keaton's orignal form is degraded to the point of absurdity."
3,Hammersmith is Out---Interesting and yet Boring,"I seen this movie as a young 20 year old. Seemed great that it was actually on TV with some nudity...plot seemed good back then too. But as I watch it now in my 50's, it was boring....but still interesting cause Burton makes a good psychopathic character---text book! But the price I paid for this movie was not worth it."
4,Elizabeth Taylor & Richard Burton - out of print. Why?,I can't believe a movie starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton can be out of print for decades.Quirky dark comedy.
3,Cauliflower in the Hat,"My kids (boys 8 and 5) still ask to hear this book at bedtime at least once every couple of weeks, so obviously the intended audience enjoys this. My own objections -- having read the thing aloud to said kids at least 100 times -- are largely aesthetic. The rhymes in this book are either strainedIt can travel five feetand blasts out with great powerat speeds over one hundredmiles an hour!or facile (the Garoo in Fadoo tell me true, they do - just like you!) to a degree that bugs me as a Seuss fan.To be fair, this problem turns up throughout the Learning Library series, not just in the volumes written by Tish Rabe. When you have to cover every health issue under the sun short of cancer and addiction (or every dinosaur or aspect of plant reproduction), it's probably pretty rough to hold a rhyme scheme and use words that kids can understand. Rabe does a respectable enough job at it that -- well, guess what the little Dinos want to hear again tonight?"
4,Another good Cat in the Hat book,"Another good Cat in the Hat book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that a repeat read has not been requested by our 4 year old, who much prefers the ""Inside Your Outside"" book she received at the same time."
3,Rhymes are a little disappointing,I think I was hoping for something that would be both inspirational and fun. Instead it is kind of dry for a Dr. Seuss book.
5,Quintessential Juju,"If you're interested in learning what Nigerian Juju music is about, or just are getting into world rhythms, this is a record you must have. One of the best of the genre. This was before record companies tried to package King Sunny as the new Bob Marley, which led to a string of lesser recordings. Juju Music, while being a studio recording, has all of the aspects of a great Juju concert; very catchy melodies, the full-blown playfulness in the rhythm section, and some tight long instrumentals. ""Ja Funmi"" is a song that will stay with you. This is in high rotation in my music listening, and will be in yours. Just get it."
5,classic and infectious,"I wore out the grooves on the vinyl ... so I had to get the disc, which sounds great. A staple in any music lover's diet."
1,a real shame,You have done a great disservice to the cause of world missions. Just as Islam is being penetrated as never before with the gospel and the need to reach out is the greatest you encourage the already timid and disobedient church to stick its neck further into the sand. Conjecture and speculation should be no match for the clear commands of scripture but there are those in the church who will listen to false prophets who confirm them in their disobedience.
2,Interesting,"The book is interesting in its approach to end times. There have been many attempts to predict a timeline of end time events. I wonder why authors still do that? It reminds me of ""88 reasons why the Lord will return in 1988."" I assume sales of that book have fallen off drastically since 1989. I guess we will have to wait until the timeline comes and goes for this one as well to evaluate the author's premises."
5,Wake Up Call,This wake up call to the west is well worth the short time it takes to read. As a seasoned global resident Ralph sends a message to the greedy west about how our unchecked consumption is perceived by the rest of the world in general and Muslims in particular. May God help us all to lay aside our personal comfort and begin to reach out in love to the needy across the globe and next door.
2,Too Bad,Another Christian who think that liberal platitudes straight out of The New Republic are some how mandated by the faith. Too bad.
2,ok except for anti Western bias,"The author puts forth this scenario where the antichrist is a Muslim, and the whole world bends to the will of Allah and becomes Islamic. While I've believed all along that the antichrist will rise from an Arab land, I don't accept the author's conclusions. Stice calls Islam a ""false religion"" .. and that its adherents are brought up since childhood in this system of ""lies"" .. yet he uses Koranic and hadithic prophecies as part of the basis of ""truth"" in his End Times scenarios. Personally, I was offended at his anti-Western bias in blaming all the evil of radical Islam on the West and Israel. He disregards the genocide that Muslims have inflicted on millions of Christians and Jews for the last several hundred years in obedience to the Koran's commands. However, while reading the book, my own deep seated prejudice against Muslims was brought to light, and for that .. I'm glad I read this book. As a Christian .. I repented forthwith."
1,Not a good map,"As a frequent traveler to Amsterdam, I found this map to be pretty much worthless. It is difficult to read due to the small/light printing of the street (straat) names, etc. Also, it only covers the city center area and does not show the southern part of the city at all. The StreetWise maps are much more comprehensive."
3,Good map except for metro & trams section.,"The maps are actually very good. And I like the weather resistant finish (A real asset considering the climate).But the section (map) of the trams makes it very hard to figure out or get your bearings. Fortinatly, good maps for this are easy to get, free, and well posted at every stop. However I geussI would still say it is a pretty good value."
5,Boyajian Orange Oil,"Quality excellent. Tasted great in cookies that we orange dipped in chocolate, not overwhelming. It is a highly concentrated flavorant and will last a long while making it a great price."
2,Decent but mild orange flavor,I do not recommend this product. I wanted it for adding an orange flavor to sugar cookies. It added little flavor when three tablespoons were used in a batch of cookies. It was very disappointing.
4,Tinker Bell Doll,"My daughter loves Tinker Bell. I wouldn't say it is educational, but she loves her none the less! Good toy!"
2,Cute but needs a better design,"We bought this doll for our almost 3 year old. The doll is very cute and looks just like a young Tinker Bell. What I don't like is the wing design. The wings are supposed to flutter but the mechanism is fragile; ours didn't work right out of the box. Plus, the wings snap off too easily (even with gentle play). Once off, they are a little difficult to snap back on. This doll is cute, but not much fun to play with."
3,Hmmm...,"This a 1988 release with Hubert Brooks the only member left.Steelie and Cleavie are the backing, produced by King Jammy.So it is a very clean peppy digital sound with not a lot of dread.This is NOT their heavy duty bass rootsof the late 70's early 80's with Donovan Germain producing.Very pleasant and well done, enjoyable for the right price."
1,Incorrect song titles,"I purchased the downloadable version of this album (without, unfortunately, having seen the previous review) and thankfully the actual songs are correct, but the tags on the songs are still for the songs from The Great American Trailer Park. If you don't want the hassle of having to look up the actual song titles and retag all the songs, you might want to purchase a different version."
1,THIS IN NOT THE MUSIC FOR ALTAR BOYZ,"I'm really not sure why this is happening. But the sample tracks on this page are for The Great American Trailer Park, not for Altar Boyz.Just thought someone should know."
1,useless on my Aerobed,"Out of materials from the manufacturer's original patch kit, Aero told me to get ""any vinyl-compatible patch kit from an area hardware store"". Nonesuch at Lowe's, but Wal-Mart had this patch kit in the camping section. The glue did not adhere to the smooth (vinyl?) surface of the Aerobed material. Patch came right off after ample preparation and curing. I'd look elsewhere if you're repairing similar (inflatable)."
1,Didn't work on my air mattress,"Just like the other reviewer, the patch came off after following the instructions exactly. The 3rd time, I even put a piece of duct tape over it for extra protection, and the bed still wouldn't hold enough air for one night. I'm still trying to find a good one."
1,Does not adhere to vinyl AT ALL,"Does not adhere to vinyl AT ALL. I would rate this product a 0 if it was an option. The packaging says ""For vinyl, plastic or soft rubber items""; nope.I will return tomorrow. DO NOT BUY."
1,Worthless,I tried to use this product to patch a small hole in my aerobed. It would not hold. I resorted to a bicycle tire patch until I can find something more permanent. This product is worthless. Do not buy.
4,They have good chemistry for people who dislike each other,"The Raven series is very enjoyable. It's a lot different from highlander since it has a lighter mood to it. It would have been nice to see Methos show up in an episode. I was surprised that they didn't show more female immortals coming after Amanda. Bottom line is that regardless of what the behind the scenes interviewers opinionate, this was a excellent show and it was getting better every episode."
2,Very disappointing,"I recently purchased and viewed the entire Highlander series. I vaguely remembered this show and always thought Elizabeth Ward Gracen was a babe, so I purchased this. Boy, was I disappointed. It was even worse than I eventually remembered.At the core, the setup is cheesy, there is little chemistry between the stars*, Paul Johansson isn't a very good actor and the immortal mythology is treated as a side-gimmick rather than central to the show (the episodes of Highlander that did this tended to be the worse ones as well.)*The Gracen and Johansson apparently hated each other, which partly explains the lack of chemistry, though bad writing didn't help.It's also quite obvious that the producers lost some of their best writers and production staff. Using Montreal surely didn't help.Fortunately, someone on eBay wanted it."
2,Amanda was not a good choice for the lead!,"The premise is good, the actors well Paul I thought was quite good the other supporting folks also quite good. What shocked and disapointed me was that unlike it's predecessor the lead couldn't carry off her end of the deal.I had thought an Amanda show would be fabulous, I loved Amanda in the original seires and in fact prefered her and much of the supporting cast over Adrian Paul for the most part. But what Adrian had that Elizabeth didn't was the strengh and skill to carry an entire episode/series.It shocked me very much I was soo looking forward to this show and as each episode aired and I got more and more disapointed I finally just gave up caring.I liked Paul I thought what they did with his character was so damn stupid and cheap, taken straight from Highlander and unoriginal.I do not know if I want this set I KNOW I don't want to hear them all snipe about who messed up, sorry folks you all blew it!"
1,A blight on the good name of Highlander.,"First thing, Amanda as the star? In the original series she was weak, selfish, unmoral and had to be saved by Duncan atleast 3 times! We never really got to see her fight because Duncan saved her! The original series writers self destructed the series so there wasn't really anywhere to go with this season. Where do they get Amanda being a Raven and a highlander. She was born in the highlands but moved soon after. It is absolutely boring, and all it does is tring to ride the coattails of Duncan and Connor. I highly do not reccomend this season, for the new fan of highlander nor for those of us who have followed the Highlander from the beginning."
2,amazing...,How could Elizabeth Gracen go from fantastic in Highander to lousy in Raven? The only part of this set worth watching are the interviews in which everyone attempts to blame everyone else...but especially the unstable Gracen and her insane real life boyfriend.
4,Highlander: The Raven,"I'm glad I purchased Raven. I enjoyed the series. Too bad it was discontinued. But I must admit the ending left too much to be desired. It was a poor way in which to end the series. I'm just saying. I do have to say, this was a good purchased and delivery was excellent."
3,oh plese god save me a spin off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this tv series only had one season a spin off of highlander starring adrian paul it was a good entry in its own right however it did not have the quality of actors to shine as highlander did elizabeth gracen and paul johnasson obviously hated each other and there was very little chemistry between them only by if you like dan from one tree hill or want to complete your collection of highlander would i purchase this
1,Poor Crafmanship,"I collect chess sets and thought this one looked unique. The set arrived promptly and was well-packaged. However, after unwrapping a few pieces, I saw that they were very sloppily made and the painting looked like that of a small child. The quality was unbelieveably poor. The set was returned for credit, minus my shipping costs."
5,Something new in music for me,While I have heard about Ladysmith Black Mambazo i had never listened to them before so when then the cd appeared in an amazon sale i decided to try it out well my friend and i enjoyed every moment of listening pleasure it's a great by i think.
5,"Easy to install, works great","The lock was easy to install and included two pairs of screws of different lengths to fit the need--my door used the shorter ones and it fit perfectly. The lever can be set so that the lock stays spring-loaded or turned so that it stays open until you turn the lever back to release it.Shame on me for not replacing that old lock sooner--I expected it to be more expensive, and more trouble than it was."
3,"Good, but...","The lock itself is very good, but the key hole portion of this is very malleable and can be damaged easily."
5,Reggae at it's best,"Black Uhuru is one of the best reggae groups since Bob Marley, and in fact were the first group to win an Grammy for reggae when the new category for Reggae was created in 1984. Nationally acclaimed, the group has a reggae beat all their own.I highly recommend any of their albums (or CD's)"
5,RockSteady,"This CD hits every cylander just about right, from the throbbing basslines to the solid drumming, to the sparse guitars and keys, to the excellent vocals and the serious lyrics. This is raggae at its best - danceable, political and remarkably executed."
1,"Ripoff -very expensive, not a good range of sizes and all thin","I had thought that, at this price, the package would provided a wide range of diameters and thicknesses. Instead there many sets of rings of similar sizes. They are all very thin - thinner than any of the O-rings in my watches. There are large gaps in the diameters provided. It is unlikely that the size you need will be in this package. If it is, then at least you will have about 20 in that size! I needed two sizes and nothing from the package was even close to what I needed.If they are going to sell something like this, then they should list the sizes - there are not that many to list!This is a bad product at a very high price."
4,Captivating...,A collection of hard-core science fiction guaranteed tokeep you tied up from cover to cover.
3,A smooth thriller,"Davina Graham is about to be given the delicate task of debriefing a Soviet defector, Colonel Ivan Sasanov of Russian Security.But soon Sasanov announces that he refuses to co-operate with the British lest his wife Fedya and his daughter Irina are brought from Russia to England, an operation which will prove to be far from easy to accomplish.When the annexe at Halldale Manor burns down to the ground, Davina and Sasanov realise that the KGB is already after them.A classic espionage thriller set in the cold war era which reminds us how quickly time passes..."
4,Good Book ffom a Good Author,I really enjoyed this book. I know the author has been around for some time but this is the first work of hers I have read. The plot was very good and she really took time to develop the characters. The book keeps a good steady pace throughout. If you are looking for an old cold war spy thriller then this will fit the bill.
2,Snow Angels,"Well done, good acting all around. Haven't read the novel it is based on but the film overall is pretty damned depressing. Made me wonder whether whatever point it was trying to make was worth all the trouble. Well, it wasn't."
2,What a downer!,"Yes, the performances were great, and yes, the craftsmanship was exemplary, but to what end? To remind us that mentally unstable human beings are capable of committing horrific acts? Well, duh!I normally enjoy small-town character studies, but I don't understand why anyone felt that this particular movie needed to be made."
1,Another 'Christian' Villian,"Hollywood is dedicated to making Christians look like idiots....and is determined to undermine faith....I won't write a commerical but anyone who has a smattering of historical knowledge knows that the effect of Christianity on the progress of the world toward a more humane society is unsurpassed...but to Hollywood it is evil because it has RULES...and kooks that promote pot smoking at 'normal' treat sex as only a bodily function with no thought to the emotional spiritual impact...are out destroy any influence it may have....Great Acting..but a garbage plot...Such a film about such a deranged atheist, Muslim, etc..would be considered unthinkable by the cultural elite..I am no ready for the hate filled counter attacks that are sure to follow this review..."
4,Interconnected lives hurtling down multiple dead ends...,"This is a well-done movie with an excellent cast. Set in a small town in the winter, the plot involves multiple tortured souls. Do not see it if you are in a down mood or need a refill on your anti-depressants.I would be hard-pressed to call it ""entertainment"" but not everything that you see is going to amuse. A good movie!!"
2,A Good Dose of Depression,"Only rent this movie if you have been happy for way too long and need a good dose of depression!We rented this movie because we are fans of Kate Beckinsale. We are still fans after seeing the movie as her acting is good.Perhaps this movie is just another dramatic vehicle for actors, writers, directors, etc., to try for academy awards? These types of movies seem to win awards.This tragic story is mostly a sick slice-of-life from beginning to end. There are enough similar kinds of tragedies on the news every morning.So if you need that dose of depression just watch the news and skip the movie."
1,What a waste,"What a waste of time and money. My husband and I bought this as we are fans of Kate Beckinsale and were looking forward to watching it. We had waited for it to play in Denver but it never did. Big surprise - an uglier, more disturbing, depressing movie, we can't remember. What redeeming value exists in this movie? None. It doesn't teach, it doesn't uplift, it doesn't help you grow, and it certainly doesn't entertain. I have the feeling the film maker and actors must be a bit full of themselves and feel that the more disturbing and depressing the story the better the ""art"". Our DVD went immediately into the trash."
2,Weird,"I love Kate. That is why I bought this movie. The movie is worth adding to my Kate B. collection, but... in the beginning I thought it was a girl- flick. Then it was a teenage thing, then it was a murder psycho thing. I have nothing of value to say about the movie, except it had the Lovely Kate Beckinsale with her delicious persona. It almost got a one star rating from me. I give it two starts because Kate is a fine actor and eye candy."
3,Hit And Miss,"This is another movie that is much better if you don't read any plot summary. I'm not opposed to challenging content, it's just that the older couple should have been in every frame and the younger couple should have been left out entirely. Rent ""Why Does Herr R Run Amok?"" instead."
1,Horrid,"I bought this because of the good reviews. UGH. Depressing, awful people with no reason to live except to make their lives even more miserable. save your money, don't make yourself miserable by watching this.Are you getting tired of titles that have no meaning in the story? Here is an excellent example. What any of this has to do with snow angels is beyond me. can't you find SOMETHING that says what the movie is about? pathetic beyond words. good acting by kate beckinsale but certainly not good enough to waste your time. I repeat. UGH"
3,"Not a happy movie, but worth watching","If you are expecting a romance or happy ending, look elsewhere. Most people would call this movie a bit depressing, but I don't mind something ""different"" like this once in a while.Of course, Kate B. is always worth watching if only for the eye candy, no matter what type of accent she is sporting.The relationships between characters and the intertwined stories are interesting, even if you wonder why Kate didn't flee her ex-husband long before things got worse.PS: I don't recommend it as a ""date"" movie, but it's fine if you like dramas that don't always end neatly.Spoiler: Small town drama, Murder & Suicide & Teen Sex... not necessarily in that order."
3,"Awesome, but not really the best album I've had.","I like Daniel Bedingfield since I've heard Gotta Get Thru This and If You're not the one.This latest album makes him sound much mature than before, and I miss thw quirky beat of GGTT. I love his first few songs. I'll rate some of them. (out of 10)Growing up - 7. Nice song.. but the lyrics is quite .. unsatisfactory. No one told me growing up will be this hard baby, no one told me growing up will be this hard.. I mean, the lyrics are just too ""duh"". No one tells me it's hard too.Complicated - 8. Fun song, I like it.My faves have got to be Nothing Hurts Like Love, All Your Attention and The Way.Buy this album.. it's not bad, if you're his fan."
5,Wrapping his words around me,"This cd was worth every penny that I paid to have it imported. It makes me sick to see such talent get ignored by American radio. I, like Daniel, have struggled with ADD since I was a child and found his song about the disorder ""sorry"" to be deeply moving & personal.In fact I found the whole cd to be like a ""step inside the mind of someone with ADD"" experience. One minute you have reggae influence,then there's some rock, then a ballad with beautifully orchestrated strings, then acoustic guitar. Cuz that's the way people like us think....we have so many thoughts going on and we're rather impulsive so we want to do it all and at the moment the action/thought is in our headOne can only hope that America starts rebelling against all the ""fake"" acts and decides to latch onto real talent like what's displayed on this cd."
2,1 good song- everything changes. Weak version of Timberlake with worse lyrics and weak music.,I accidentally bought this because I heard 1 song that was a pop rock song. The rest of the album is r&b or club songs which is ok but he's not great.
5,Fascinating,A great read. Fascinating story about a man who had a vision and would not give up on his vision. Without him the world would not be such a colorful place regarding language.
4,Not thier best album,I bought this CD because I am a huge Depeche Mode fan and am trying to collect their entire discography. All and all it wasn't my favorite album of theirs. It has a couple good songs on it but none that are absolutely spectacular. If you are already a Depeche Mode fan go ahead and give this CD a listen. If you're new to the band and are checking them out then start with a different CD.
3,Slightly underrated.,"Okay, I like this album. I like this album a lot.It's no Black Celebration. It's definitely no Violator. Then again, it's not Exciter either.For me, the album's high point is the synth-reggae instrumentation on ""Satellite."" I like all the songs, but if you're just starting out with Depeche Mode, there's much better albums out there."
1,The Cover is the Only thing Interesting Here,"I bought this album when it first came out because, as other teenagers in the early 80s, I was mezmerized by any song with a synthesizer in it. At the time parts of it were somewhat fascinating. Now after years of listening to all sorts of electronic music, from Avante Garde to Trance, I must say that after a recent complete listen of this album, I probably will never put it back in my cd player again. I now find the songs are either boring, lackluster, or annoying. I will keep it for the excellent cover, which is what attracted me to it in the first place. There is just better DM stuff to listen to."
1,Thumbs Down for DM,By far a pitifull album by our esteemed Depeche. Only one good song on the entire disc.
3,Give it a try.,"""A Broken Frame"" is probably the weakest DM album of them all. But, there are some good tracks on the album, such as ""Shouldn't Have Done That"", ""Leave In Silence"", and ""See You"". Sure, the songs sound somewhat infantile, but you have to remember that this album was Martin Gore's first stab at writing songs for an entire album and it is a good effort considering the band was not sure they would continue after Vince Clarke's departure. So give ""A Broken Frame"" a chance. You'll be glad you did! ;)"
2,Two quality singles do not make an album,"To say that there are only two songs worth hearing on Depeche Mode's second album, A Broken Frame, would be a bit of an exaggeration, but without a doubt the band suffered from the sophomore jinx here. It's not that the songs are consistently unlistenable; in fact they're pleasant enough, but nothing on the album stands out like its first single, ""See You."" Even the album's one other highlight, ""The Meaning of Love,"" sounds like a Speak & Spell outtake. Keeping in mind that Martin Gore would churn out many singles as good or better than any on Speak & Spell in the years following A Broken Frame, it seems that rather than missing Vince Clark, Depeche Mode and Gore were just at a creative low point here. Only hardcore Depeche Mode fans need this, casual fans and neophytes should go for The Singles 81>85 instead."
2,A Boring CD,"I must admit I didn't ""grew up"" listening Depeche, instead, was indoctrinated starting when I was around 17 by a good friend, and later by who became my wife. Nevertheless, I do like their music, and have enjoyed every single CD from them I had bought... until now. I didn't think I was ever going to say this, but: This disc by Depeche Mode is a terrible disc. Tremendously monotonous, boring... ugh! I don't hate it, but I don't think I will be playing it often!"
1,A Broken CD,"I won't lie to you. This is the worst DM ever got. Everything is too hokey for my liking, and the writing is really bad. Especially on Monument. ""my monument, it fell down"" That is one of the stupidest choruses I have ever heard. However, I give one star because Depeche Mode turned into an amazing band after this record. They had to release two bad records before they hit their stride."
3,Transitional,"Once again, this album has threee great songs in ""Leave In Silence"", ""The Meaning Of Love"", and ""See You"", but as an album there is way too much undevelopment and filler to warrant a higher score. It is interesting, though, in order to recount the band's transitional years, and so fans might want it for that reason."
4,Everyone's got to start somewhere,"Yeah this is probably not one of Depeche Mode's greatest albums. Some of the songs are a bit patchy and the lyrics are definitely ropey but it has something that some people tend to forget in albums - charm! It's thoroughly modest and they're not trying to be anything other than themselves. True, the cover of this album does gives a mysterious edge to it - and certainly for a pop band it does seem markedly different from anything else. But Monument, My Secret Garden, Leave In Silence and even Sattelite have something about them that seem oddly addictive.It may never reach the greats but sometimes the greats are a little too pretentious and we need something that's real - that has flaws - that's human! It's those sort of things that make this album have a rare charm despite some of it's failings"
3,Honestly,"I wont kid you this is my FAVORITE full-length release from DM, but its not their BEST by far. I usually recommend this release for ""The Sun And The Rainfall"". I am frequently skipping over ""Satellite"" and ""Monument"", but ""See You"", ""Leave In Silence"", ""Nothing To Fear"", and ""Photograph Of You"" really make this album solid. ""The Meaning Of Love"" is a hit, ""My Secret Garden"" is solid, and ""Further Excerpts"" fits right in, so it ends up being a rather solid piece of listening. Too many songs missed by grabbing the compilations only, so I recommend you select this release if you are contemplating your next DM purchase. This is also my FAVORITE release artwork! =) I'll leave you with this last comment... if you are looking for good DM to dance to, this is not the selection you want."
1,"Rusted, doubt it's all stainless steel","Rusted at spout and inside, soap was coming out green. I don't think it's really stainless steel. Smelled awful the first time I had to replace the soap."
2,Beautiful but not good quality.,"I chose this product because of the design, but after a few months it got rusted at spout and it also leaks from the spout."
3,Tried something new from Amazon,"I love Sibelius's Second Symphony and enjoy Finlandia so I thought I would try this album with the Tone Poems which I had never heard.Unlike most of the reviewers here, I have almost no technical knowledge of music. I just follow my emotions.Finlandia, with it's almost mythical history and powerful emotional content, was something I wanted to add to my library. However, I had never heard the Tone Poems. They are lovely and I enjoy them. Only time will tell how deeply they sink into my musical soul."
5,A Fine Bargain!,"A marvelously performed and warmly recorded compilation of favorite Sibelius tone poems from one of the late 20th Century's foremost conductors of Sibelius...and it's dirt cheap! I can no more adequately describe the Romantic ""chilly warmth"" of this dramatic music than I could live above the Arctic Circle; there's no other music quite like it. It took me until I lived over twenty years in Northern Michigan to warm up to it, then its appeal became obvious -- go figure."
2,About What You'd Expect...,"Someone gave me this game and I have since sold it. Not really worth playing. I did not see the point, but maybe as a family game it would be good."
3,Unclear conclusion,"Solzhenitsyn's writing is interesting and cohesive, but his conclusion is unclear. He leaves no doubt that neither bourgeois-democracy nor dictatorial communism are remotely acceptable to him, but does little to make concrete the third way he envisions. His ideal state seems to be built upon Slavophilism, a vague spirituality, and certain aspects of democracy, and I would like to learn more about that than his rants against the modern and historical US and Russian forms of government."
5,Must see Anime,"I watched all 13 episodes at very recently, I am currently watching them for the forth time. This is a great anime for anime fans and people just getting into Anime. However I would say it is not for those who scare easily because of many...images. This is one of the best Animes I, a big anime fan, has seen in some while and recommended to any fan of anime looking for a great anime."
2,Hellsing Review,As a fan of the Hellsing series I can not honestly say this series is worth watching. There is no real reason to watch this series when Hellsing Ultimate is clearly the superior work. While Alucard is badass if you watch the Hellsing Ultimate OVAs and compare them to the manga of the series you will see that the Hellsing Ultimate OVAs are perfectly animated version of the manga. So don't waste your money on the impure souls series as one it has nothing to do with the manga and two its not even finished. Hellsing Ultimate is the only true way to enjoy Hellsing animated.
5,BEST IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME,"all i can say is hellsing is great anime it has a awesome action, story. just everything it very good about it nothing else needs to be said :D"
4,HellZing,I got it because I didn't want to spend the money on ultimate collection and I feel kinda shorted the story is ok but seems really short for a series the characters are lackluster and the main character is just way to powerful (it's a pet-pev of mine)but its worth a watch and maybe a rewatch.
5,Not the cliched vampire anime I thought it would be.,"Good stuff. I figured it would be a run of the mill, shallow super vampire story...and in a way it is, but the anime is executed pretty darn well. If you're thinking about trying it, you should."
3,Very generic.,"While the story for this anime is somewhat interesting, it is not very well planned out. The animation and musical score are lacking. I also thought that the script did not translate very well into English. To your average anime fan, this is probably a good anime. I personally did not like it."
4,"i love it, however...","there could have been so much more to this and...there is, i would like to say these discs are completely different from the manga and OVA. if you want to watch what you have read in the manga watch the OVA's if you want something different from what you have read buy these.i personally did not enjoy this as much as the OVA's and manga because i read the manga first and i expected more, it did not live up to my expectations and turned into something completely different and yet highly disturbing in its own right, it deviates so greatly from the mangas that there is the other series of anime called Hellsing ultimate OVA."
5,Great Anime!,"I kind of brought this on a whim. I was looking for some new anime to add to my collection and I had never seen it before. I kind of jibbed alittle over the price, but decided to go for it. That turned out to be a good decision. The animation is goood and the story is good. It is certainly not suitable for younger viewers. Lots of blood and profanity. It's a must see for adult anime fans though!"
3,Gift.,I bought this as a gift and had never heard of it when I ordered it. I received it in a timely manner. I gave it as a gift and did not watch the video's. I was told by the person that requested it that the videos appeared to be remakes or bootleg as they were very grainy. I have not seen it so I do not know for myself but the person that got the movies is all into this movie so I have to take her word for its poor to average rating.
4,Entertaining but with a twist,"If you like actioned packed anime sagas this is the dvd collection for you, but if you like the anime that goes really in depth with the characters and gives their whole autobiography then hellsing is not for you.Hellsing revolves around a vampire named Alucard and its says little about his past. Thats were the baffling twist comes in. At the end of the saga there is a twist.There is a man by hellsing who he is i dont know. All i know is that this baffled me.So if your into character plots and such stuff. Hellsing is not for you !!!!!!"
4,"Different, but in a good way,","Hellsing offers a different approach to Anime. Although the animation of the characters is extremely different from one another, it hardly distracts from the flavor of the films. The plot is a predictable one but with a few twists and turns. The ending is a bit stupid, and is dissapointing. However, each episode leaves you wanting more in a strange way. I never really got caught up in Anime before, but this was strangely intriguing. It has its strong points and its weak points, if you can look past them, this might be a good series to rent."
1,"No box, not Ultimate",Has no box like it shows in the picture. I'm also pretty sure this is the old addition not Ultimate.
3,a bit self-indulgent,"Of the three non-fiction books I've read by W.H.Hudson(the other two being The Naturalist in La Plata and A Shepherd's Life)this is far the weakest. Where the personality of the writer was unobtrusive in the other works, it becomes intrusive to the point of being offensive in Idle Days in Patagonia. There are some interesting anecdotes about local characters and happenings, as well as details about animal behavior. But the biggest drawback is the overlong philosophical rambling, of which the topics sometimes seem downright trivial. However, don't be put off by one lesser work. The Naturalist in La Plata is an excellent book of natural history of the pampas, and A Shepherds's Life is quite good as well."
2,A Bit Disapointed,"What I love about the writings of W. H. Hudson is his wonderful descriptions of the flora, fauna, and folklore of South America. But I suppose it is true what they say about idle minds. There is way too much anthropological philosophizing in this book and it gets tedious. The romance with rugged naturalism is a bit much."
1,insincere,"i just can't stand listening to a vocalist who i don't believe. this guy's sound is so laboriously cynical, it haunts my dreams. yes, the lyrics are unconventional in structure, but for what purpose? i'll add a proper review later, but i just wanted to take this albums score down while i still had the chance."
5,to daniel,"this is the original version, grip it on the other level was released in '89. the geto boys self-titled album is the re-released version that was released in '90 because it was so classic in rhyming skills. to be honest, this version is much better because the other version doesn't include the original songs like the gangsta of love version and it also doesn't include search and destroy and no sell out. glad to help you."
5,Primo Gangsta Rap,"Coming out on the heels of Straight Outta Compton, this second album by the Ghetto Boys (the namechange came with the re-recording for Def Jam) puts their own 5th Ward spin on the genre. Accompanied by omnipresent Scarface samples, they managed to interpolate views on sexual politics, the music industry and the drug business into their raps on sex, violence and drug dealing. Also, they continued to develop their use of horror imagery and themes, which began with Assassins on their first Rapalot LP. And former dancer Bushwick's meditations on his stature turn into one of the best raps ever spit out. You don't want to end up on Ryker's with him!!Also seek out Willy D's first solo effort, Controversy, for more work in the same vein."
2,WHAT VERSION IS THE ORIGINAL?,"I THOUGHT THE SELF TITLED ALBUM ""THE GETO BOYS"" WAS THE ORIGINAL VERSION. IT SOUNDS MUCH BETTER. THE RAPS ON THIS ALBUM SEEM LIKE THEY HAVE NO LIFE. IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE PICK UP ""THE GETO BOYS"" TITLE INSTEAD. TRUST ME YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED."
5,An excellent recording.,"Andrew Davis and the Toronto Symphony deliver an excellent performance of ""The Planets""--the most famous section, ""Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity,"" is particularly vivid and rousing. Filling out the disc are two performances by Norman del Mar and the Bournemouth Sinfonietta: the lovely ""Brook Green Suite"" and the little-heard ""Somerset Rhapsody,"" in which Holst takes a cue from his good friend Vaughan Williams. Especially at its bargain price, this CD is well worth owning."
3,Small with a powerful punch,"Wojnarowcz's life is presented in this slim volume composed of black-and-white drawings, varying text sizes, and an intentionally chopped up style devoid of punctuation, lending a snapshot-like, stream of consciousness feel to this brutal biographical work."
4,Excellent Introduction to the Bhundu Boys,"I first saw the Bhundu Boys in England in the mid 80's and have been hooked ever since. True Jit is their most ""commercial"" album and the one most heavily influenced by western production techniques. However, I have always used this record as an introduction to African music for my friends who are interested in the genre as it is easy on the ""western ear""."
2,Looking for more...,"I just wasn't impressed with this CD. Perhaps I was simply expecting too much, either that or I've been listening to Road to Ensenada and Pontiac too much lately.The second time through was a bit better, but I kept waiting for the song that really made me say ""wow, that's a great song/hook/lyric"" like ""Who loves You Better"" or ""Family Reserve"". Songs that make you hit the replay on your car stereo 4 or 5 times in a row. For me, it never came. I currently own every original CD he's put out, and I love his stuff, but there were so many songs that felt like they were old tunes re-fitted with new lyrics that I just couldn't get behind this CD. Another reviewer said it felt ""forced"", and that was an apt description, even the gospel tunes towards the end felt like retreads of past songs.I consider myself to be a die-hard fan of Lovett, but this CD probably won't get heavy play from his collection."
3,"Any Lyle is good Lyle, but this one's a bit repetitive","I've been a Lyle fan since college, way back in '86, and his concerts are the only ones I will pay those outrageous fees for--they're always worth it. Even so, this latest CD is a bit of a letdown. Maybe it will grow on me, but it hasn't been playing around the clock in my house the way Road to Ensenada or Joshua Judges Ruth did. I miss those insightful, simple lines in Nobody Knows Me; the catchiness of a good country lyric such as ""You can have my baby but don't touch my hat""; or the original, clever spiritual of ""Church"". There's still the fusion of blues, gospel, country, and folk on this album...it just feels more forced. All in all, it's an album for die hard fans only. If you're new to Lyle pick up Pontiac or Joshua Judges Ruth first."
3,"He phoned it in, but it's still better than most.","It's nowhere near as good as The Road to Encenada. But then, few things are. It's also not as good as Pontiac. But Lyle's average work is better than other people's best work.So yeah, this isn't a classic, but it still blows the doors off of posers such as Chesney, Keith, McGraw, Brooks, and any other pseudo-country dork you can think of."
5,"My first Lovett CD, and still a favorite","I owned none of Lyle Lovett's music until I heard him perform ""In My Own Mind"" on The Tonight Show several years ago. I bought this CD immediately afterwards and it is still among my favorites. The songs, every one of them, are so interesting, intriquing. There are fun songs, songs of contentment, songs of loss -- all work together so well in this collection."
3,"Been there, done that (better)","Buy some of his other work first. While I'm a huge Lyle fan, this album seems a bit of a re-tread of previous material."
2,Underwhelmed,"All those years waiting for this? The Truck Song and San Antonio Girl were previously released so they are not even new. Plus they pretty much sound the same. The title track is one of those overproduced/overdone numbers that you would expect from Garth Brooks. If you liked I Love Everybody, Pontiac, Joshua Judges Ruth, Lyle Lovett and His Large Band and the Road to Ensenada you won't like this. Mine is already in the used rack."
4,Familiar stuff,"I'd actually give this one 3 1/2 stars if they'd let me. Lyle is one of my favorite artists, but to me it feels like he might be coasting a bit. The songs here are pleasant enough, with great foot-tapping music in the western swing tradition and Lyle's usual compliment of unusual characters. But, very few songs here sparkle with the humor, depth, and compassion I've come to expect from him.If you are a Lyle fan, why haven't you bought it already? If you thinking about making this your first Lyle purchase, I'd advise starting out with Step Inside This House or The Road to Ensenada."
3,My least favorite Lyle Lovett CD...,"A lot of people have complained that all the tracks on this CD sound the same and/or they sound like a re-tread of Lyle's previous work. I'd agree with the first point but not the second. To me this CD sounds more like Lyle Lovett meets Billy Ray Cyrus. The music here seems more influenced by '90s pop-country than the more traditional country, blues, and Texas swing sounds present in his earlier work. I'll keep listening to my old Lyle Lovett CDs of which yes ""The Road to Ensenada"" and ""Large Band"" are probably the best."
2,Lyle Let Me Down,"I've been an avid fan for about 3 years; one of those who hate country but love Lyle. This is the first of his cds which sounds like a traditional country album - with the exception of the 2 glorious gospel songs. I agree that the music is redundant, but it is also that twangy-kind of country music that Lyle never did. I've listened to it twice, straight through, and probably won't listen to it again. What a disappointment."
2,"one notch above ""I Love Everybody""","Great voice, and some great fiddle, but with the exception of 2 or 3 songs on this CD, they all sound the same. And a number sound very much like songs on prior albums. This was a disappointment."
3,Haven't we heard all this stuff before?,"The songs on this album sound oh so familiar. In other words, there's not much new going on here; it's a bit of a rehash of Road to Ensenada, and not in a good way. I got bored with it. The only song that stands out is the excellent and moving ""You Were Always There"". When you hear this track, it makes you realise what's missing from the rest of the album. It's not a bad album, of course, but after such a long wait, I expected more."
2,half-hearted,"I own all of Lyle's albums, and play them over and over again. He could make better music than almost anyone without even trying; with this album, he seems to have set out to prove it. Songs about trucks, music that sounds like country cliche, another joke song, etc--I have to keep reminding myself that I own this cd, and I was really excited to buy it back when it came out. That said, it's better than most things. It's just not the same kind of thing as what I expected."
4,Sillier than usual - again,"As a Lucy Walker enthusiast I have been amassing a collection of her romance novels, and have been interested to see the way they have progressed over time. I prefer the novels of the 1950s and early 60s. I believe this book was written in the mid-70s. It features a ridiculous plot concerning derring-do in mining camps, a helicopter, some Wedgetailed Eagles, a girl's underwear (or lack thereof; very daring for L.W.) and a hero called ""Jard"".In other words, a typical Lucy Walker novel and plenty of fun for the afficionado."
2,Skip this one,"Maybe in 1980 this book would have been of use, but in today's ""Green/Organic"" world, this book is useless. Too dated to still be in print. I donated mine to the library."
4,"Very good album, still rough around the edges","Lots of potential here, Southern Bitch is just a good producer and a little more experience away from being great. If you dig 70's southern rock, and like to invest your time listening to a band develop you will dig this!Similar to: Skynyrd, Drive By Truckers, Molly Hatchet, etc."
1,"A Memoir Should Be, Well, Somewhat True","Lillian Hellman was a fascinating woman but it has been well-established that most of her anectodal vignettes are complete fabrications. Not only""Julia"", but also the story about her cousin Beth and ""Turtle"". The writing is great but is diminished when you read this work as it is, mainly fiction. Then, the actual style is simply bad fiction writing. A pity, such a talented woman had to write these sad fictionalizations in the service of her own neuroses."
2,Proceed with extreme caution,"There was no ""Julia."" Hellman helped herself to Muriel Gardiner's life story. ALL of Hellman's memoirs must be read with extreme caution -- her ""inaccuracies"" go well beyond what is normally expected in any autobiography. (And I also think they've been overrated as literature.)"
1,HOW TO STEAL SOMEONE'S LIFE STORY AND GET AWAY WITH IT,"Reluctantly, I have decided to give this book another go around. The stories, especially that of the wonderful Julia, would be very engaging IF THEY WERE TRUE. The Julia story is a hoax and a fraud. It is based on the real life-story of Muriel Gardiner (1901-1985), a talented psychoanalyst, intimate friend of the Freud family and generous anti-fascist crusader. IT IS NOT BASED ON ANYTHING THAT LILLIAN HELLMAN EVER DID. This fact has been told by many others besides me. How long will it take to get the message straight?"
5,FOR MY COLLECTION!,"This is one of the LPs of Ronnie in the early years of Phase 4 Stereo, made in Japan. Of course, it was released for us some years before by Vocalion and by Decca and London Records. I bougth it to know how different was. Oh surprise! The shape of the cover: Is like as the original LP reduced exactly, to make a square, and the cover is like the original LP, as the back cover, made in England. I have it close, only as part of my collection of Ronnie's music. I can't say any word about the sound, but it doesn't matter, I suppose is very well."
4,Adorable shoes,The shoes are very cute and true to fit. The clasp on the strap is heart-shaped and very feminine.
2,Why?,"Why did I get this CD? I read the reviews of previous purchasers and it got an over all, good review. I bought thinking it would be this wonderful and one of a kind remix album. This being an Ayumi Hamasaki album, how could I go wrong?This CD is wrong all the way through. I wanted to like the CD but I ended up skipping over most of the songs. Track 11 ""Appears D-J Turbo Mix"" is probably the stand out track for me, it's the best on the album.The CD case is cool though, all glittery and there's an insert that looks like it's part of a puzzle, but I think that's only for Japan release albums. If you like cheesy Jazz, and Bossa Nova with a techno beat, you'll like this album, otherwise it's a waste of money."
3,Before you buy...,"I bought this thinking the vocals were sung in English, since the song titles are listed in English and it is called the US & EU version. Not true. Plus, all of these mixes are single or radio edits. Not a single track clocks in at much over four minutes, with the majority not even making it to the four minute mark. Since I do not speak or understand Japanese this sounds like high pitched whining over some club beats to me. Not bad, but not exactly what I expected. Although, the work featured from some of these high-profile DJs is quite acceptable, especially ""And Then"" mixed by the Rhythm Masters."
3,reluctantly recommended,"This gets three stars because it is the only readable (just) exposition of Schenker's theory in one volume available--to my knowledge. Otherwise it should get one star. The author's prose is clumsy, often ungrammatical, and his argument is unsound, often logically fallacious. Eventually something better will come along. (Readers interested in music theory will probably want to look at PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns too.)"
1,boooooooring,This book is poorly organized and pompously written. I hear Schenkerian analysis can be helpful and interesting but you wouldn't know it from this book. Not that I even made it very far. I wish I hadn't spent the money.
4,Ever since...,Ever since I saw Schindlers List I wanted to know more. This story draws you in and makes the reader think he/she is experiancing what the people in the story are. Truly a wonderful book.
3,A Good Perspective,"I am working on a book on Oskar Schindler, so I certainly appreciated the perspective of his wife. If you're considering this book to augment your understanding of Oskar Schindler, then this is an excellent book. If you're reading it purely as a memoir, it has some serious flaws. It is short on detail and struggles with a cogent chronology for the reader to follow. Remember, Emilie Schindler was not a writer, and she had help to even write this book.However, this is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the enigmatic Oskar. I read it in a few hours. I think that amount of time is worth the valuable insight I gained into Oskar's character and motivational profile."
4,Barefoot Trimming,I think this is a great book and a smart move for horseowners. Only downside is I would like a little more instruction on the exact how-to. Easy to read.
3,Decent Book,"Decent book to give you an idea about barefoot trimming and keeping your horse in a more natural manner. Johnson's style of writing is not the greatest for an informational book. Tends to be too wordy and goes out of his way to use mile long words. Reading the book, I get the idea that Johnson is trying to impress upon us the extent of his scholarship."
3,"Playful, clever","""After Hannibal"" is light on character and plot-driven, set near a small Umbrian town where most of the characters live on the same road. It reads like a pause, an interlude between Unsworth's densely crafted and thoroughly enjoyable historical novels, (Land of Marvels; Sacred hunger, et al).What a wonderfully gifted writer!Constance Richardson, Author, ""Swimming Upstream: A Memoir."""
2,"No Fava Beans, but plenty of Chianti","I'd been looking forward to this book since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and was enormously disappointed. No cannibalism. No Clarice Starling. Plenty of the Italy that we had all been expecting since hearing that the author was attending the trial of some Italian serial killer, though. So where was Hannibal Lector? Well, in a very intrigueing and disturbing fashion the author has hidden him in the text. At first I was disappointed and then I realised that this was literary detective story as much as it is a horror story. Which one of these characters is Hannibal Lector, disguised and under a new identity? And what is he going to do? Understanding that - and no, I'm not going to give it away - turned it into a very interesting book indeed. Was it worth waiting over ten years for? I don't know. BUt as always this talented author has given us a lot to think about."
3,Not Unsworth's Best,"As always, Unsworth's skill as a story teller and creator of compelling characters pulled me through the story. But by the end I realized that I didn't care about the characters, and their stories seemed more sketched than real. I think he tried unsuccesfully to tie too many story lines together.Read Pascqualli's Island instead."
3,very disappointing,"I have read almost all of Barry Unsworth's books and am extremely disappointed in ""After Hannibal"". In part, this may be because I live in Italy and have some idea of the expat scene here. But there's more to it than that, since I absolutely loved ""Stone Virgin"" which is set in Venice and to my mind is one of the most intriguing and mysterious novels I have read in the last few years. Barry Unsworth usually steeps himself in the historical background of his subjects, as was the case with ""The Rage of the Vultures"", ""The Sacred Hunger"" and the more recent, and fascinating ""Morality Play"" (not to mention ""Pascali's Island"". This one gave me the impression that perhaps the author had a contract to fulfill and therefore didn't do more than go through the motions. Che peccato!"
4,An Umbrian pastoral with contemporary invaders,After Hannibal is another fine example of Unsworth's ability to brilliantly incorporate historic narrative into contemporary fiction. His droll storytelling is made sharper by the fine portrayal and exploration of characters -- and his lyrical descriptiveness.
4,Great 80's synth pop album,"Great album from the late 80's ('89?). Burning Flame is a little more Pop than the rest of the album, and is probably the most ""well known"" song of the 11. I highly recommend this album if you are a fan of 80's synth pop."
3,Good....Could have been better,"I will admit that this book did a good job of pulling me in. The action and intrigue were well paced and written in an easy and flowing manner. The characters were cookie-cutter but still interesting to see. The dean, frat brothers and alumni made for a nice villan and an interesting alternative to the whole ""one big bad guy"" idea. Instead of one head honcho, we have three to contend with. Each with their own motives and mission. However, there is one thing that spoiles a book for me and makes me give a bad review. With all the words in the English language, why is it that authors feel they must use the four-letter ones? The ""f"" word was on every page...used as a noun, a verb and an adjective. There are many words in the English language...perhaps the author should have taken some time and found them...."
3,A Bowdoin Alumna,"I enjoyed The Pledge, although I thought the author was trying a bit too hard to be ""literary"" - too many flowery descriptions, etc. As a Bowdoin graduate, though, it was fun to read the book and hear some of the phrases and nicknames for things that I haven't heard in 10+ years. I think that Rob Kean has a future in the Baldacci/Grisham genre of writing."
4,Excellent and suspenseful novel.....must read!!,"Rob Kean's first book was a success in every sense of the word. The story kept you entertained, guessing, surprised and not wanting to put the book down for what might occur next. I attended an Ivy League college, joined a frat, and played a college sport. These connections made the story even more captivating for me on a personal level. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick, fascinating read about the powers and extremes of fraternal brotherhood."
2,Evil Rhyming Brothers,"Ok--I picked it up because it looked entertaining, but The Pledge just wasn't that great. The plot, on top of being drawn out and convoluted, was implausible. What kind of exclusive fraternity bids a pledge without knowing one blessed thing about his past? And come on, generations of former brothers that still hang around the frat house? It reminds me of the thirty year old guy who trolls around teen dance clubs trying to pick up high school girls and impress people with his fancy car. And, I was very dissatisfied with the way the story ended. I was hoping Mark would at last reconcile with his fugitive father, who was sort of at the center of the entire conflict--but we never even met the man!For me, the best parts of the story were the rhymes that Mark and the other black cloaked figures recited. Maybe the whole story could have been in rhyme--that would've been something!"
4,Very Impressive Rob!,"I certainly enjoyed reading ""The Pledge"" being a fraternity alum who went to the same high school as Rob. I could relate to many of the stories, humor and descriptions of greek life and the students at a small liberal arts college. I especially was impressed when some of the character names resembled similarities to our town upbringing. Additionally, some of the character actions put me in sync with Rob's mindset. I do, however, agree with some of the other readers comments about some of the characters actions being a little too unrealistic in addition to the overuse of certain four-letter words. Nevertheless this book is a thriller in the end. Anyone who has been a part of the greek system will certainly relate. My favorite quote about the attractive blue-eyed blonde girlfriend of the hero, ""a body that roughly fifty percent of the campus longed to hold, and the other fifty longed to resemble."""
1,Unreadable!,"It's not often that I can't finish a book; usually if I can't it's due to a lack of plot interest. This is the first book I haven't been able to finish because I disliked every single character, even the two so-called good guys. The first hundred pages had nothing but evil characters manipulating and getting away with everything. I disliked the main good guy (can't even remember his name) for ever being involved in such a disgusting frat, and his girlfriend for going out with him; for someone who was so against frats, it seems strange that she should be going out with a former frat member.One hundred pages into the book, and there was not even a glimmer of hope that the evils of the frat would be punished. All of the actions of the characters were infuriating and just depressing to read.Thanks goodness I didn't buy even the paperback version of this book; it would be one that I couldn't even display on my bookshelf."
3,"Silly Fun, Silly Read.","As a national officer of Alpha Epsilon Pi, the last remaining Jewish fraternity, I picked up this book on a lark. Hazing is still a large issue in today's fraternity world, much to the dismay of most responsible participants.This is obviously a work of fiction. There are horrendous cases of hazing but nothing like the sadistic brand written about here. Also, while I recognize this was fiction, the absolute stretches made in this book, strained my ability to believe in the characters and the story.Yes, there are other flaws (how many people can be killed, bought off, etc. without anyone raising an eyebrow) and why isn't a Sigma on the board of directors if they donate so much and dominate the campus?But, it was a fun book that was a little escapist, a little scary and more than a litte silly."
2,Kind of a disappointment,"I'd heard this book was really hot ... And I'll admit, there were some good ""hazing"" scenes, but overall, I found Kean's writing pretty tame. Not nearly as good as Alan Dickson's _The Greek Way_ or Michael Nambla's _Barely Brothers_."
2,"Greek life, not at its best!","I am a sucker for any novel set on a college campus, prep or boarding school. Unfortunately, I found the book to be suffering from the toos - too wordy, too long and too much going on and not enough fully explained for my liking. I think the premise was a good one but needed some good editing and then some pulling together."
1,have yet to read a worse book,"This book is probably one of the worst and unrealistic things I have ever read. The characters (especially Shawn) are unrealistic, as is the portrayal of a fraternity full of murderers, rapists, and thieves. Sometimes I wish someone would write the truth about what fraternal organizations do...this kind of trashy libel is getting old."
1,Worst book,"This book lacked any factual representation of Greek organizations and seemed to be simply out to get a rise from people who have sons and daughters in those organizations. The plot was weak and unfounded, the portrayal of the fraternity members ridiculous and stereotypical. Perhaps Mr. Kean should do that thing called ""background research"" before he writes another novel."
3,An Exciting Debut But A Bit Too Far-fetched!,"The Pledge is a fast-paced and exciting debut by Ron Kean that will most likely find wide appeal among both younger and older readers. It will definitely hold your attention from beginning to end. So why a ""3"" rating and not higher? Basically because the plot and characters, while interesting, tended to stretch my willingness to extend credibility beyond the breaking point in too many instances. While I understand this is a work of fiction and some implausability is 'allowed"" in order to maintain suspense, The Pledge, for me, went too far too often to rate it more than three stars. Nonetheless, The Pledge is worth reading and I'm looking forward to Kean's next book."
1,Stunningly bad,"Wow, I'm surprised that anyone gave this more than 2 stars. This is a candidate for the worst book I've read in my life. It starts bad and gets worse, with stupid characters and absurd plot twists.Most grating is the consistantly bad writing; Kean simply writes poor sentences, and it can be painful to read them. I mean, I don't expect Nabokov, or even Grisham, but this was just an amateur effort throughout. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised after reading Kean's thanks to his collegues at a big consulting firm for their support. Hey Kean, go back to your day job shredding documents rather than writing them!Maybe I just felt cheated because I had to lug this 720-pager home from the library and back."
2,"Bad writing, unbelievable story","Several things bugged me about The Pledge. One, I thought it was terribly written, full of cliches and stereotypical characters that bogged down every page. Author Rob Kean desperately needs an editor; the book's 514 pages could have easily been sliced by a third. I was skimming through the final pages, something no novel should ever make you do. Plus, there was another thing that nagged me throughout about The Pledge - it should have been set in the 50s! Eliminate the few references to cell phones and e-mail, and Kean's bunch of mafia frat thugs would have been much more believable conducting business in any era but the '90s."
4,Couldn't put it down- Buy this book!,"This book invited me inside and made me wish the story would continue even after I had finished the last sentence, primarily because of the feeling underlying what Mr. Kean has written. Kean obviously has passion for the craft of writing. It's apparent in every paragraph that he loves words and goes nuts when he has a good story to tell. The plot is interesting, though in places it is needlessly obfuscated. The main character, Mark Jessy, is beautifully drawn, fully realized, and totally believable. On the other hand, the females in the book are less believable, tending more to sound like juvenile fantasy figures than real women, but that's forgiven because the book works."
4,Holds your attention,"Having never been a fan of sororities or fraternities, I found this a very compelling book. The author did a great job taking the meaning of ""brotherhood"" one step further. With all that is written today about college hazing, this certainly brings home the impact these organizations can have on young minds. It's a book you won't be able to put down."
3,Pretty Good for a First-Timer,"As a whole, I thought the book was very, very intriging. However at some points of the story it got somewhat confusing, without giving too much of the plot away, regarding certain members of the Sigmas, and what was their motivations for certain things. My favorite, however, is Mark Jessy and I thought he handled the investigation perfectly. The ending was rather good, and justice was served."
4,GRRR,"I thought the book was great... people who are criticizing its stereotypical characters are ignoring the very intriguing and original story line. The characters are type-cast, but they are also well-developed and interesting. I was hooked from the first couple of pages, and I couldn't put the book down! The story was involved and exciting, and I highly reccomend it for a thrilling read."
5,"Gripping, funny, and poignant...","I devoured my fingernails, laughed out loud, and even had to dab a tear or two! Rob Kean's ability to evoke so many emotions may be unprecendented among first-time authors. Sure to inspire some unhappiness among short-sighted ""brothers,"" it really shouldn't offend fraternity boys any more than the work of Thomas Harris angers doctors or caucasians. And this former Greek finds it every bit as compelling as Harris' ""Silence of the Lambs."""
1,He gets small colleges right; plots and writing wrong,"Wait for the mass market paperback.Though I read this in one sitting it was more to study what not to do when writing, and for the record this is one of the rare times I agree with Kirkus' scathing review. A terrible freshman effort starts this two book deal with Warner; lets hope the second novel is actually edited."
5,Picked it up and never put it down!!!!!!,"Rob Keane has captured the suspense, intrigue, and politics in a way suggestive of Alan Greshham. He however, applies his unique spin to the settings and plot to keep you hooked!As a parent paying ""ransom"" in the form of tuition to 2 major universities, Rob adds to my suspiscions that administrators are not there for the interest of the student."
5,What command of plot and character!,"This is hands-down one of the best, most thrilling, most tangible works of fiction I have ever read. Mr. Kean captures the essence of fraternity life so completely, it's as if he lived, ate, and slept at the ""Large white house on the corner of College and Maine"". His acute descriptions of the Maine winter scenes rival Jack London's recounts of the Alaskan Wilderness. Meanwhile, the depth and richness of his characters would make Tom Wolfe proud. This is a must read! Throbba Kid has scored on a corner-high blast from outside the box."
5,Psyche Returns Into The Darkness,"Psyche is back with their first original new release on Metropolis (USA). This CD is a must for anyone who likes Dark, Electro, music that you can actually hear the lyrics. Not noise polution like so many of the industrial bands out there. Psyche has covered it all since way back in 1982 or so. Darrin Huss has an amazing voice that keeps changing with the new directions on this CD. 15 Minutes is the strongest track to be considered for a single. I think a great club mix for this one will come out. I hope so as this is one great track. Some amazing soundscapes can be heard throughout this CD. I just love it. Psyche has always made great music that would fit into any Horror or Sci-Fi flick. This CD is no exception. Order it right away. Great price too!"
3,A hard review to write.,"To be fair and correct, Psyche have a sincere approach to electronic originality that is hard to deny. This whole album is quite complicated as far as genre is concerned. At times it sounds like the NIN-Pretty Hate Machine Era of music, other times it brings to mind the darker elements of Depeche Mode. Some of the songs are slightly dancey, while most of the songs lean closer to Melodic Darkwave, or kinda Synthpop meets Industrial with suddle hints of Jungle and Goth. Despite the genuine creativity of this artist, I found myself growing board with it's slow and melodic consistency. Nevertheless, there are three songs on this album that I applied to my ipod and rather enjoy. Those songs are ""Bloodcurse"", ""15 minutes"", and the title track ""11th Hour""."
4,Sangean WR-1 Delivers as Promised.,"I'm very happy with the Sangean WR-1 AM/FM radio I recently purchased. Its metallic silver face and wood grain cabinet give it a high-quality stereo component appearance. which looks great on the table near my armchair. More importantly this radio brings in my favorite stations with excellent clarity, a clear warm tone and deep rich bass. I didn't need an external antenna at all, and no more signal drift like I experienced with radios I've used before. An excellent buy."
3,"Complete, but....","This book is complete, but the illustrations are rather hokey. Some of the sections get bogged down in unnecessary detail, and other leave stuff out. This is obviously something that was written a while ago, and partially updated without going through the trouble of making the illustrations better.At the same time I bought this book, I also bought The Live Sound Manual: Getting Great Sound at Every Gig but Ben Duncan, #0879306998. This was a much more readable book, although lacking in illustrations, and geared slightly more to the professional. The only thing in Live Sound Reinforcement that wasn't in The Live Sound manual that I found useful was the one page on 'ringing out the room' to address feedback before it happens.Both books gave good step-by-step instructions for setup and good explanations of theory, but the latter just did a better job."
4,This book gives you everything from basic to complex,"This book is great for anyone interested in sound reinforcement, or sound in general. Stark starts off with the basics of sound, then covers microphones, smaller scale PA systems, then concert touring systems. His language is easy to understand, and his book provides information on all aspects of live sound, from miking to processing. The use of diagrams are very helpful, and he breaks the book into sections which make it easy to use as a reference guide. However, this book is not for the professional, or someone who is very knowledgable about sound or sound reinforcement. I would recomend this to a beginner or an intermediate level sound person who wants to learn more about how to reinforce sound. In short, if you have taken courses on sound, or are very knowledgable this book isnt for you, but if you want know how to wire a full concert PA system will all the works, this book is for you... He starts you off slow, and dives in."
4,"big n, thick",there is alot in here. a lot to read that is... if you are looking for a lengthy breakdown onwhat sound waves are made of and how they react... if you want a deep understandingof what happens in a subwoofer... this could be for you. It has the look and feel of acourse manual... there is a lot to take in.No quick fix. Very involved. But if that is what you want... its all in here.
3,too pro,"Good basic information, but very short on information regarding microphones and placement, particularly relative to acoustic and other instruments that I was particularly looking for. Not very informative on models and products available which all have different specs. Could use a much more informative section for the small travelling musician and small rooms/venues."
4,Pantocrator He-Man,"The Pantocrator over the altar here has always been popular with what used to be called ""confirmed bachelors."" And apparently still is, if its popularity on blogs is any indication. When I was in the seminary most of the seminarians referred to the place across the street as the ""National Crime"". But an exception was always made for the Pantocrator in Judgment and his fabulous pecs."
3,"Poorly organized, unduly California-centric","I found this book disappointing. It does a decent job of explaining things in plain english, but the organization is poor, and the author seems to think everyone who needs to do estate planning must live in California. He doesn't even qualify CA-specific legal statements with ""This is the law in CA"" (let alone offer a state-by-state chart), he just presents them as if CA state law would be the only body of law that could possibly govern estates."
2,Book does not include Everything You Should Know,"This book did not give me what I was looking for. I wanted to know about issues like how you should hold asset---Tennants in Common, etc. versus the other possibilities and how the this owership designation will affect the transfer of assets at your death. The book's title says it includes ""Everything"" a baby boomer should know---it didn't and now I have to purchase another book to get that information."
5,Mad Hatter Charming,For my daughter's 13th birthday she had an Alice in Wonderland costume party and I bought this charm for her charm bracelet to commemorate that. It is very sturdy and the detail is great.
4,One of the better free Kindle titles,"I found this little novel to be a real page-turner and a heck of a fun Kindle read (especially for a freebie--at least as of this review). Tommy and Tuppence are a fun pair and the story virtually never drags. I am a fan of Christie's Poirot and like the genre, but found this book to be a refreshing change of pace and tone. Go ahead and download it--you won't be disappointed."
5,The most sensational book I have ever read,"Agatha Christie is at her best. Tommy and Tuppence are the most loveable characters I only wish that Miss Christie had written more books about the two. The story is fantastic with an unexpected ending. Brilliant, sensational, terrific."
2,COULD NOT GET INTO IT,I READ ABOUT 20% AND IT IT MOVED WAY TO SLOW IF I HAD MORE PATIENCE MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE PICKED UP
2,Who knew Agatha Christie was a winger?,"The story itself was ok, if far-fetched. Not worth the trouble of throwing away, but not worth reading either.What annoyed me was the premise: The government did something nasty behind the peoples' back, and the story's heroes are charged with preventing leftist political parties from discovering it before the coming election. Can you imagine the disaster if the working class actually got a say in the government? Heavens!"
2,Yuck,Not her best ... I'm a big Agatha Christie fan but this book definitely fell short. Sure glad it didn't cost anything!
2,Be aware--this Agatha Christie features detectives Tommy and Tuppence,"This novel was a re-write of an Agatha Christie novel featuring detectives Tommy and Tuppence. It wasn't plausible that these two young people could more quickly outsmart seasoned detectives in solving a complex multi-murder situation. I'm never disappointed in an Agatha Christie novel, but I was with this one. Good thing it was free. Give me a Hercules Pierot-solved Agatha Christie mystery any day over a Tommy/Tuppence-solved one."
2,Not a lick of sense between them,"In post-WWI London, two out-of-work friends decide to form a private detective agency, but their first offer leads to Tommy's capture by Bolsheviks.eBook downloaded from Gutenberg. I couldn't get into this book at all. Neither Tommy nor Tuppence have any sense, and it was just too convenient that they connected with a rich American searching out the same young woman. I managed to read a third of the book before I couldn't stand it any more. Spelling, grammar, and formatting were acceptable."
5,Welcome young adventurers!,"This book introduces Christie's readers to the Young Adventurers, Tommy and Tuppence, a couple of charming young English friends struggling to make do in the post WWI years. Hoping to be hired as amateur detectives, they become involved in a criminal conspiracy and an international spy ring. Fun reading, with plenty of plot twists to keep you turning the pages. PBS made an excellent series from the Christie books, called Partners in Crime, also available from Amazon. I highly recommend those as well."
5,Secret Adversary,"Agatha Christie is my favorite mystery writer. I love Tuppence and Tommy, and enjoyed reading the introduction of the characters."
4,Kept you on the edge of your seat with suspence,Well written keep you entertained. Always guessing who the villian really was great suprise ending. Would recommend to any of my friends to read
4,Still keeps you in suspense and entertained,This short mystery novel has held up to the test of time. I recommend it as an entertaining and suspensful read to all mystery fans/
3,Great Lead Characters Bogged Down in Weak Book,"Tommy and Tuppence were sparkling creations by Agatha Christie (and their ability to transfer deliciously to the small screen is also a proven fact.) But sadly they were never given as strong mystery material as Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot were and have, therefore, languished on the literary sidelines to a great extent. Their first appearance, in the Secret Adversary, is a good example of this problem. Christie is weakest when politics are involved and the story is hopelessly naive with the fate of the world being controlled by one man, Mr. Brown, who ultimately is rather easily bested by those two crazy kids of the flapper Twenties, Tommy and Tuppence. The author never, ever, succeeded in achieving anything remotely approaching a spy thriller. Still, this book will hold interest for anyone wanting an early glimpse of the crazy duo who are always a pleasure to spend some time with."
4,haven't read much of her work,This is only the second of Agatha Christies works that I have read. She writes with an interesting style. I find it easy to follow and certainly holds my interest. I find myself guessing and guessing again who the villain may be. I am still not finished with it as I am just a bedtime reader. I take time to enjoy what I read rather than speed reading through them. I am sure that I will be on the lookout for more of these books.
4,Very Entertaining Mystery,"This is the first Agatha Christie book I read since highschool. You can tell she was exceptional at weaving a story together from the innocent duo - boy and girl in their 20s, just trying to make a bit of money, to getting themselves mixed up in a scheme above their heads. it was exciting to see how it unfolded. i think their navie nature allowed them to get ahead where a professional spy could not."
4,A refreshing and clever mystery,"As a first time Agatha Christie reader, this mystery was smartly written and clever in clues and plot twists. The main characters are engaging and have a timeless appeal with their quit witted intellect and independence. I mostly read contemporary fiction but found this a refreshing read. Secret Adversary relies on good writing rather than most current fiction that leans heavily on sex, gore or violence for the plot twists."
3,SECRET ADVERSARY,"I haven't read this book, but I like Agatha Christie. Again is it for my Kindle and I am not adjusting too well to that kind of reading"
5,Good story,"I discovered this story on Amazon that I had never read before. I""m enjoying it immensely. It brings back memories of the pleasure I've always enjoyed reading Agatha Christie's books in the past. She was a terrific writer of suspense."
1,Impossible !!!,"I don't believe Agatha Christie wrote this thing. It is totally a piece of junk. The beginning 4% of the book (that is how much I can carry on reading) are all about two losers babbling the most mundane conversation. No person with any self-respect, let alone Agatha Christie, would produce such thing."
5,secret adversary,Downloaded this story on my kindle ap on Evo phone and loved it. I read while my husband drives - It's great. Thanks
3,Good book,"It's a good book, but not so good. It worths reading nevertheless.I love some characters and the confusion created around the enemy character."
4,Overall a winner,"we went on a trip with several of the thinner self inflating type of mats and one of these which were were skeptical of. In the end everyone wished they had this kind. Much more comfortable than the thinner self inflaters, and also packs much smaller -- but same weight.There are some negatives of course:* You have to blow it up. Pretty trivial though.* If you get a leak, you have zero pad. It comes with a patch kit but who knows if it would work? They are so small I'd recommend just taking a spare.* Noisy. I think some of the insulated versions are quieter but they cost a lot more. This plastic makes lots of scratching squeaking sounds when you move on it.* Wish a wider but not longer version was offered. This is true of all pads I looked at, not just Big Agnes."
3,Beware. Misleading description and price,"The air mattresses described as Short, Petite, and 3/4 all were about the same price and did not give the specific length. I ordered the ""Short"" air mattress and expected it to be 66 inches long because the price was between the 48 inch air mattress and the standard 72 inch air mattress and other models of Big Agnes air mattresses have a 66 inch version. However, I received the 48 inch air mattress and the information with the mattress describes only the 48 inch version, standard 72 inch version, and long version, with no mention of a 66 inch version for this model. So the ambiguous descriptions as short, etc. apparently are actually the 48 inch air mattress at about a 30% higher price than the air mattress identified as 48 inches."
4,Durable,"Very durable mattress for the serious hiker. This 20"" wide mattress when inflated is more like 16"". Being 55, this mattress gave me very comfortable sleep on hard ground. Thanks"
4,decent add-on book for GMs and players,decent assortment of spells for 1st or 2nd edition dungeons and dragons type games (with optional 10th and dragon spells).the best part is the mana/memorization part in the beginning with a menu based design system for game masters to tweak the magic system to their liking. This is useable with most versions of DND. The spells are as well but will require some modifications here and there to conform to later rulesets.
5,Wonderful movie. Great insight into the life of Dom DeLuise and friends.,"This is Dom DeLuise in a casual and wonderful setting. It's full of laughs, songs, great conversation but is mostly real. You'd never see something like this in an ordinary interview or guest appearance... this not only gives great insight into Dom's world but also some other fantastic talents in Hollywood. They are all legends!"
1,This is not a comedy program.,"I waited and waited for this DVD thinking it would show some of the funny sides of our beloved Dom. There were a few but mostly this recording was depressing. I am sorry, but to me it was depressing. Dom could have cooked through the entire 45 minutes and it would have been so funny. When he was a guest on someone's cooking show, he was very funny! Also, out-takes with Burt Reynolds were funny but there were none."
2,Stain on sweatshirt!,"The delivery and service were super fast. However, when the sweatshirt arrived, it had a stain on it and I was unable to get it out in the wash. It might just have been a fluke, but I wasn't terribly happy about it!"
2,Could have been better,"It's rare to find a good sci-fi movie from Korea, so I really tried to keep an open mind. However, I must admit to being disappointed. The premise is intriguing. It's reunified Korea and a string of murders are happening with the victims being once-prominent government-employed scientists. The story deals with cloning and genetic experiementation and could have been a tightly-crafted futuristic thriller in the vein of 'The Minority Report'. Also, the inherent cultural struggles of a newly reunited country that developed differently for over 50 years. However, the wooden acting from the cast (it's worse if you watch in original Korean) and the lack of direction sink the movie. The action scenes are adequate, but otherwise a disappointment."
5,Happy Eating!,"This book will give insight and hope to those who, on a daily basis, struggle with the complex process of eating which can be very challenging for many. It explores the idea of how problems with eating can impact a child's social development as well as self-esteem. It addresses the need of a collaborative effort between the caretaker, teachers and professionals that work with the child, to ensure a successful treatment plan."
1,A product of its time,"I bought this at a second hand book shop for 1 ($2), I would not want to spend much more than that.The book suffers from two major problems; the date of publication and the author's journalistic style.Regarding the former, the book was published a few years before the collapse of the Soviet Union and now that the archives have been opened (to an extent), some of the chapters are inaccurate.The latter problem is the author's style. Oberg is a journalist and this is no academic text. The book has no referencing whatsoever, no foot noes, no bibliography and even no index - we simply do not know where Oberg got his information. Oberg also has a tendency to write in a hyperbolic fashion that seems more at home in a tabloid newspaper.These two problems combined mean we get a lot of speculation, guess work and unnamed 'sources'. Oberg simply doesn't know what happened in a lot of cases."
4,"slow, nice and easy","With his personal and mesmerizing musical work, musician and DJ Bonobo(aka Simon Green)infuses vibrancy into a genre that too often dangerously borders elevator Muzak. Ever sincereleasing early material from his hometown of Brighton, Bonobo caught the ear of critics and fans alike, which prompted a collaboration with a certain MR Scruff, and a signing to label Ninja Tunes. Now a worldwide audience can discover the subtle riches and mood buildings of ""Animal Magic"", it jazzy breaks and dreamy soundscapes, all designed for the perfect, most beautiful, chill-out experience."
3,"Not his best, but not bad either...","This one is not as deep and good as many of Bonobo's other efforts. That's not to say is not a good album. It's OK, it just lacks a lot of the depth, variety, and musical intelligence that is obvious and plentiful in ""Dial M For Monkey"" or ""It Came From The Sea"".The music is very loopy and uninspiring at times, but somehow he manages to make a decent album. Much more downtempo and slow than his later work and quite eclectic.Best song IMO is Silver. If the rest of the album would have captured the essence of that song, we would have had another masterpiece in our hands..."
4,"Good, but not *that* good","I'm missing what everyone is raving about. Yes, lots of downtempo released these days (and yesterdays) is derivative, but that hardly makes this a masterpiece. Where I differ from the rest of the peanut gallery is that I've heard everything on this album done before and done better. Mukta does a better sitar (in part because they know how a sitar works instead of changing the synth voice to 'World - Sitar') and Piero Umiliani did these strings (change voice to 'Pads - Strings') before. Some of the synth work itself is not unlike the simpler work by Boards of Canada, but without the technical wizardry they use to turn their instruments from emulators into expressive tools.Hey, I still like this record, and I'd certainly buy it again. I just wanted to like it more than I do. I suspect that once Bonobo get a grasp on the capabilities of their tools and the concept of timbre becomes intuitive, they'll be excellent. For now I think they rate a Good."
2,Wasn't anything special,"Saw this CD on Listmania, read some reviews and decided to try it out. I found it pretty boring. Repetitive and dull. Save yourself some time and SKIP THIS."
5,FOR ALL YOU CHILL-HEADS!!!,"Bonobo is one of those artists who typically shows up on chill-out compilation sets--maybe a little too often--but the man does indeed put the C in Chill-out. From beginning to end Bonobo's very ambitious debut, Animal Magic, is a wave of druggy downtempo tracks reminiscent of work from a more laid back Amon Tobin. That's no wonder since Bonobo mentions him in his liner notes as well as has remixed a song or two of his. Songs like the haunting ""Sleepy Seven"", the enchanting ""Shadowtricks"", the the Tobin-esque ""Kota"", and the melanchonic ""Terrapin"" are all stand-out tracks that showcase Bonobo's talents."
2,Good guide.....by 1974 standards.,"Produced in 1971/74 and probably a decent guide 30+ years ago. However, I would not recommend this guide to today's collector because it is simply obsolete. The prices are pre-ebay and the photos are dark and often out of focus. Group Photos of clock fronts (no photos of backside) do not provide enough detail."
5,AH THE 80'S,"This is my favorite album from the B's.""She brakes for Rainbows"" ""Girl from Ipanema she goes to Greenland"" ""Summer of Love"" ""Roam""I was the only African American girl singing the lyrics of the B 52's in my old neighhborhood.I wouldn't trade discovering the B 52's for anything in the world."
3,some fun to be had,"When this album was released the B-52s were at their lowest ebb, and in some ways you can hear it. But this album's an example of Fairlight synthesizer love gone troppo: everything on it sounds totally synthetic, and some of the subject matter only contributes to the off-kilter feeling. ""Theme for a Nude Beach"", though, is gloriously dreamy - just as you'd expect - and ""Ain't It A Shame"" is a slightly deranged country song. The pretty closer, ""She Brakes For Rainbows"", is typical B-52s: sweet, idiosyncratic, and overextended."
4,Not bad,"This is not a classic b-52's album Summer Of Love was butchered but other than the cd is descent to say the least. My favorite songs are Detour Thru Your Mind, Theme For A Nude Beach,Girl From Ipanema Goes To Greenland, Juicy Jungle and Ain't It A Shame. Than their are those bizzare but pretty alright songs like Housework and Wig. The rest are just ok really. I recommend Wild Palnet or Whammy! for classic B-52 listening."
2,A slight step up,"B-52's albums released in the mid-80s don't exactly tickle my fancy at all, since they'd pretty much abandoned their original sound and hadn't yet come upon that overproduced late-decade Nile Rodgers dance sound which became so infectious (and so chartworthy). This isn't really an exception, though it shows the band moving away from the dull cheese-fest ""Whammy!"" into a collection of actual songs. I give the band credit for the gorgeous pop of ""Summer Of Love"" and ""Ain't It A Shame,"" and the bizarre synth excursions of ""Detour Thru Your Mind"" and ""Girl From Ipanema Goes To Greenland,"" but the rest of the album is basically a studio mess (""Housework""? Give me a break), not helped at all by the death of Ricky Wilson. Most of the bandmembers worked solo for this release, therefore drawing possible comparisons to the White Album, were the White Album about 50 million times less good than it actually is."
5,Great Product!,This is a very well made product. These spark plugs seem to last forever. I strongly recommend them for all gasoline machinery.
2,Didn't work for my Toro unfortunately.,"I also had the EXACT same experience as another reviewer Craig. I tried to replace a Campion RJ19LM with this plug. It's got a visibly much shorter head and I had a heck of a time pushing it up into the ignition coil cap as a result. The entire time I mowed the lawn that day the mower sounded like it was going to die over and over. Basically reving up and down, up and down. I tried reinserting it and starting it up both before, during, and after mowing. I gave this plug an hour of my time, and then I gave up. I put the year old Champion back into the mower... lo and behold, ran great. It might work for some mowers replacing the champion, but for my 2006 22"" walk behind Toro, it was an unsatisfactory experience. Sorry!"
5,Excellent,Some reviewers have had issue with the length of the terminal. I replaced the sparkplug terminal with a longer one (from the original plug) and it works great.
5,1942 John Deere LA,With the advertised technology of the e3 spark plug I decided to give them a try in my antique tractor. What a difference they made!! I had a problem with the engine hesitating between idle and full throttle...no more. The engine seems to have a little more power and even starts easier. Highly recommended!!
5,Sparky,There a little pricey but they work well.Starts are easier....only time will tell if they last.
5,Whittling the Old Sea Captain,"This book has step by step instructions and drawings to create the Old Captain, his First mate, and his Second mate, as well as suggestions for buoys, lobster traps, and oars. The book is well written and well illustrated."
4,Great Album,"Although not as good as True and Heart, this is still a great CD. I especially like Snow Drop and Kasou. It has a little bit of Laruku's newer music style. I like their earlier music better, but this CD is definately worth owning. Hyde is hot and has a great voice too :-D"
1,Get the newer version,As of 30 Nov Garmin released a version 7. Make sure you get version 7 if you're interested in this product. Check the Garmin.com site for the latest versions of their products.
1,Out of date,This product Was very good. It is now way out of date. Version 9 is the current version. This is two versions behind and does not have eastern Europe as the new versions have. Great product but of little use now.
2,Disappointment,"I love this fairy tale, and I love this illustrator, but I do not love this book. The story itself is unnecessarily wordy and boring. The illustrations, while lovely, are boring, too. That's the short and sweet of it. Disappointment."
3,The Little Mermaid,"I knew this was the Little Mermaid copy I wanted. Amazon had it and at a reasonable price. I needed it immediately; that service was available and in LESS than 24 hours from my online purchace, the book was in my hands!"
5,A Magical Book,"Long before Disney created Ariel, Hans Christian Anderson created the real Little Mermaid. This book is a rare collector's edition, and an absolutely beautiful rendition of the original story. I love it!!"
4,Kevin's Review of The Little Mermaid,"This is a very nice book. A very delightful story that is written in a style both classical and modern at once. This is basically the same Little Mermaid that most are familiar with (The old Disney movie). But this book does have its differences that are essentially evident. The pictures' realistic colors and proportions fit this story well. This was a well-put together story.I'll admit that it is my personal preference for books where this book loses a star. The Little Mermaid movie and book have always struck me as a tale with many moments of heavy sadness, and that turns me away. The fact that this book is a love-story with fantasy tie-ins doesn't help my attitude."
3,an original touch,"One shouldn't expect the cliche' in this book's artistic approach. It is original and understandable, making it possible for children and adults alike to have an image of Hans Christian Andersen's wording. Although quite few images are present, they are infact very nice and pleasing to look at."
4,Great like always,"Although this wasn't as amazing as their debut, it still remains a great album. The subjects on this album range from school abuse to the vegan epic ""Meat Is Murder"". This also had one of The Smith's big hits ""How Soon Is Now?"". Morrissey's anger comes out more in these set of lyrics than their first self-titled album and Marr progresses musically. All and all its a great album but not their best."
