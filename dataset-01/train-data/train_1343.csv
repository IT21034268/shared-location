2,interesting but not riverting,Interesting insider's look inside the French Foreign Legion. Not as much fun reading as Rogue Warrior thou.
4,The darker side of willpower and the combat mindset,"This is an interesting book, if nothing else because of a fascination with the idea of the legion. But let's just say, if you aren't interested in the darker underside of civilization this book isn't for you. It can best be described as a walk on the wild side. At worst it's an example of minimalist behavior on the part of hardened men. If you can't handle that then don't read this book. Reality, isn't found at a StarBucks coffee house.I can understand, due to some of my own past, some of what these men seek. You'll never be more alive when you are close to death. You'll never understand the meaning of brotherhood until you've stood with other men like a stone wall.We should be grateful for the knowledge these men go where others would not dare. As George Orwell said, ""People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.""Je ne regrette rien."
1,Amazon Needs to Fix This,"This mp3 file should not be 5 seconds long. I downloaded this mp3 album from E-music, and it's just under an hour. Amazon, can you look into this??? Please????"
2,bad customer service,"i baught this camera about a year ago and i takes good pictures.. and is easy to upload, hower the zoom has broken 4 times, and my camera has had to be sent in to be repaired, it can take many months for this repair, and my camera has been replaced, but the zoom just broke again yesterday, and this time i plan on buying a new camera."
4,AWESOME LITTLE CAMERA,"ProsVery SmallBig ScreenStylishMovie Mode is AWESOMEoptical zoom 3x ""ok""OptionsGreat camera to carry around on belt clip with caseeditI forgot one of the best thingsIt has rechargable battery, and cradle. No more running out batteries.ConsQuailty is not Great just averageFlash is not all that BrightJubril[...]"
5,Amazon you're a Life Saver!,"I purchased a Fujifilm Finepix f440 model back in Dec. 2005 along with a underwater housing at a store on Kauai. Couple of years went by and I dropped the camera on concrete and the lcd broke and all I had was a black screen. Try shooting pics or video under water without a lcd:( 2010 I found a f450 model on Amazon in used but good condition. That lasted 8 months, another dropped accident. Just recently I purchased another f450, this one was in excellent condition and it came with all the accessories plus extras(this one came with a case and I'm back taking awesome underwater photos. Thanks to Amazon for having outdated cameras still on the market for purchase. What am I going to do without you? Once again THANK YOU Amazon!"
5,A liitle late but a Great Camera...,"I'm fulfilling a [forgotten] promise I made to myself to write a comment on this fine product, after I bought it two years ago for $180, a refurbished price I think. It's a great camera, or should I say it Was a great camera since I lost it, stolen but that's another story.This is a great camera to carry around for snaps, fits easily in the pocket, and makes good videos, up to three minutes long which can then be stitched together on the computer to make a longer movie. I found it to be rugged and forgiving of abuse [it became the house-camera used by an 18 year old knucklehead] and yes the lens did stick but I just shoved it back in [luckily?] and it worked fine. And the pictures, great, or to be honest one out of five or so was great; and looking back on the rest of them they are precious because they record moments that otherwise would be lost!I'm in the search now for a new camera and I will be pleased if it works as well as this one did."
2,Written by an author unfamiliar with Law & Order the TV show,"Boy was this ever sad - Lennie Briscoe was somehow magically promoted to a Sergeant in Dead End and the DA was Adam Wentworth (and not Adam Schiff as in the show). The dialogue is stilted, there are few descriptions and the plot is weak...."
5,Love these pens,"These are my daily go-to pens. Never clogs, nice fine line but without that ""scratchy"" feeling. Fits well in my hand."
4,Very Good Red Pen,"Very good red pen ... fine point still ""flows"" well. Buying by dozen makes price very reasonable ... interesting that a new pen is cheaper than a refill!"
1,This is for small pieces of shrink wrap,Well first off I ordered this item thinking it was for a spark plug WRONG. It was for a small piece of shrink tube about 1 inch long. Hires the seller of the item gave me a return label and refunded my money (THANKS) that was really nice of them But I really wanted the spark plug.
2,Doesn't Match Up to all the Hype,Sorry but this movie was just barely entertaining. Is it because it has nazi zombies? Is it because the characters are not your average Americans on a road trip (but average Europeans on a road trip)? Yes it is barely interesting due to these two factors but otherwise there is nothing much left to talk about aside from a couple creative gore scenes. Nothing original or even well executed here. How did this movie make it so far aside from skillful marketing?
2,Kinda lame watch on netflix for free,"predictable, still decent but couldve been so much better with so much less. Im not sure where I heard it but this was meant to be one of the best zombie movies of all times, not at all. Watch on netflix for free"
3,Immortal Fascism?,"A group of medical students came for fun in a remote Norwegian mountain cabin for just being exterminated by zombie Nazi soldiers.Unlike the Johan Borgen's works, this movie leaves a sort of impression hinting at immortality of fascism the remnants of Hitler's soldiers impersonalized.Anyway, is this story much worse than musicals of Holocaust ""Life Is Beautiful"" earned a range of awards for?"
3,"Spam in a cabin, with Nazi zombies","Whether you may enjoy this movie depends on whether ""fighting Nazi zombies"" grabs your attention or not. It did for me. This one starts off like a traditional spam-in-a-cabin slasher, and the Nazis don't show up for a while. At the end of the day, until the last 30 minutes, you've seen all this before. The filmmakers could have done more with the premise. Nevertheless, it's a competent horror movie with a unique Norwegian black metal soundtrack. If you like this sort of thing, and you know if you do, you'll at least want to rent this. Otherwise, you're probably better off giving it a miss.Props for the Evil Dead 2 shed homage."
4,Snow,"Very different take on the zombie genre and very original, it's worthy of consideration 2 be part of a horror collection."
1,Pathetic,"This is a zero-star movie. Its pointless, juvenile, ludicrous and the zombies are just ordinary folk painted gray.The ""comedy"" is unfunny and misplaced. Cr@p acting and useless special effcts.Don't waste your time with this retarded offering. Go with Romero!!!"
1,Really bad movie,"Although a couple of scenes are artfully done and I love the idea of nazi zombies, this movie is just plain bad. Disjointed, poorly acted and silly (someone needs to realize that you can't amputate your arm and than run like your in a long-distance marathon). I had heard some good things about this movie but I say don't waste your time."
2,"Heil 'Dd sn'!, Say what?","OK First THIS MOVIE IS NOT IN ENGLISH.Yeah I know it is mentioned in the fine print but it cost me $17 to find out. I mean, Take a look at the case. Everything on the case is in English and without my reading glasses I would never know the movie wasn't. So I'm trying to watch it and the subtitles are small, poorly placed, and the yellow color all conspire to make it unreadable. Which may be just as well because knowing what the characters are saying doesn't help the movie much.I don't believe in slamming a movie because it is in a language I don't understand because I bought it on impulse without research. It is just a bad movie.The two high points were the opening menu with the blinking eyes on the disembodied Hitler head and when I threw the piece of crap movie in the trash."
4,"Dead it snow, dead it snow, dead it snow.","Oh the zombies outside are frightful in this well done slasher horror film from Sweden. Standard slasher rules apply: group of 20 something students go to remote cabin, creepy local tells them about a horrible moment in the history of the place, and before you know it, it's undead bingo hour! There's Nazis! Zombies! Nazi Zombies! Spewing intestines! A brain on the floor! And MORE zombie Nazis!How the Nazis became zombies is never related to you, but who cares? You've got terrified screaming students racing through the snow as jackbooted corpses chase them! You have a menacing Commandant who looks like he still gets to the Undead-Gym three nights a week! You get an outrageous two-on-thousands men vs zombie battle, complete with chainsaw! And a killer snowmobile! All in 90 minutes.Really, what is not to love here? ""Dead Snow"" is bloody, trashy fun, even if you can predict what's coming from a mile away."
4,"Loved it, just wished there was a english version","The suspense was good in this movie. Most of the attacks were towards the end of the movie which made the suspense better. Special effects were great (alot of blood ,intestines hanging out...etc). Would like to see a sequel if possible. There just is something freightening about Nazis jumping out of the snow attacking people when you are on vacation.."
3,How can you go wring with zombie Nazis,"*** Some spoilers ***I pretty much liked this movie. It had a way of being graphic without being explicit in the beginning and got more explicit as the movie went on. The only sore point is that I am more in favor of the Romero type shambling zombie, not the marathon runner zombie. The characters were pretty likable, too bad they all die."
4,For all Zombie film lovers! Original Nazi Zombies!,"This in my opinion was a very original Zombie film. It had all you would expect with an added twist... Humor! :) Friends go to a remote cabin in the woods yeah yeah yeah. However this time it becomes known to them that Nazi's, the most cruel occupied this land during the war and when the townspeople had enough they killed them...Or so they thought. Now armed with Chainsaw, power tools etc to protect themselves the friends must fight off the Nazi's that have come back for revenge in the form of Zombies! I thought this film was very well made and filmed and the Zombies were super cool! I also liked that they used not super models for the cast but average to nerdy type people. Fun and entertaining! Thanks for reading :)"
3,Not the best zombie movie ever,"It was pretty good, all in German subtitles. Was pretty good as far as cheesy zombie movies go, we got a pretty good laugh...definatly not scary."
4,Surprisingly good,"Some very entertaining one-liners keep this fun. Good effects overall, subtle allusions to other films (like Evil Dead), wry, tongue-in-cheek writing....definitely better than expected.This won't topple 28 Days Later as my fave....but it was worth the watch."
4,Norse Zombie Flick,"I saw it on Netflix last year.The movie is a pretty good and is probably only 1 of 3 really good zombie flicks featuring Nazis.I believe it is the only zombie flick from Norway at this time.The cover on the DVD is from an actual scene within the movie.The special effects and makeup are done really well.The acting is professional and not typical B grade. (I don't know any of the actors but they may be well known in Norway)Plenty of blood splatter occurs.Zombie fans will probably want to own this one!I won't give away the plot as usual, but lets just say:Young People, ski lodge, nazi zombies, mayhem ensues! Typical zombie plot!Some people have called it a comedy, but I'm not sure a few humorous moments qualifies it as a comedy as most would expect something likeFidoorShaun of the DeadorBio Zombiewhich are all true zombie comedies."
4,Really good zombie movie!,"I wasn't really sure what to expect, but my husband and I really enjoyed this foreign made Zombie movie. It's typical in that there is a group people going to spend time out in the middle of nowhere and trouble ensues, but it also has some European history plot points which we found gave it an interesting twist. We liked it so much we bought it for our zombie enthusiast friends."
4,Enjoyable Zombie Flick - Recommended,"""Dead Snow"" is one of the better zombie movies I have seen recently. Purists might not like it as much as I did since it has a good bit of humor thrown in and the zombies are not mindless ""shufflers"", but there is enough gore and suspense to make it worthwhile for most fans of the genre.No plot spoilers from me; the movie follows a group of Norwegian medical students (one with an intense dislike of blood) who travel to a remote cabin on a snowy mountain for a Holiday getaway. I really liked the isolated feeling that was conveyed and the detached outhouse added a level of creepiness all on it's own. The general setting is also fairly unique since the most of the action takes place in the snow.The setup is a little forced with some of the early dialog making references to other horror movies and a convenient visit from a ""local"" who fills the students (and us) in on the local history Nazi occupation.This was a fairly fun, but disposable zombie flick.Recommended!CFH"
2,Very disappointing.,"This film is based on a simple, yet effective idea. Nazi zombies defending their treasure and killing anyone who tries to steal it. It's not original, but it works. Also, the visual concept of nazi zombies in the snow and the ice is a very strong one. However, all this potential is wasted, as the film sadly tries to be comedy horror and fails miserably at it. It's just not clever or funny enough to pull it off, resulting in a juvenile mess of clichès and poor acting. The zombie make-up looks surprisingly uninteresting, but the gore effects are decent enough.I expected a lot more from this film and was very disappointed."
3,Movie a no but the dvd a go,"I was not impressed with this movie at all and I love zombie flicks. There is no need to get into why but I was baffled that it is a zombie movie and nobody turns into a zombie. But I gave the disk three because the features were good an plentiful. The movie, I'd give a one."
2,went horribly wrong,"I gotta say thank god I did not buy this movie as intended and waste my money, instead I rented and phew, so glad I did, cause what a waste of a an hour and a half. That's really all I have to say about it, waste of my time. Sorry I can't be more helpful, all I can say is if you think you really need to see it then catch it on Netflix or something, don't waste your money, unless your a die hard and will anyways, there is no stopping you then. But just remember I did warn you."
5,Nazi zombies,"Nazi Zombies. Those two words meant that there was no way I could resist watching this movie and I have to say that I am glad I did. I am a fan of the various zombie series already, though not a real 'horror movie' fan. This movie is unique in that it isn't a group of zombies aimlessly shambling around looking for brains, but they are almost like ghosts defending their ill gotten gains beyond death. It add to the genre which I think is good. The acting and story also has a touch of dark comedy to it which I can appreciate. The film is gory and isn't block buster quality, but isn't meant to be. If you are a fan of the genre or just on the fence this movie is worth watching."
3,Dead is right,"It has subtitles. So, read fast. It's a unique idea somewhat to use the German soldiers as the ""zombies"", but the storyline has a lot to be desired. It was comical in some areas (although to others it may not have been funny, but I'm a horror fan so this was funny not scary to me). Whoever wrote the lines has a hate on for Nokia, see if you catch that part of it. I did and it cracked me up. I can't say much more without giving things away. Story is decent, horror part not so much. I would say it's not that I didn't like it, it's more I was expecting something more in the horror range and not in the spoof category. Intentional or not, that's how it comes across to me."
3,It was ok!,"So many of my friends said how great this movie was and being a big Zombie fan, I bought it. It is dubbed in English and honestly not enough Zombie action for me."
5,very grown up,My grandchildren feel they have a very expensive machine with them. Not only it really protects the toy but makes the children feel very important.
5,"""EXCELLENT""",After reading this book I am looking for Sweet Tempest. Allshe wrote and worth reading!!!
3,Religious Studies,"People will have problems with some of Berger's ideas; namely that religion is a social construction. So, of course removing ""truth"" with a capitol T will offend. However wordy or latinate his words get, he is still, by far, much more lucid and friendly to native english speakers than the majority of those who write in this feild.Those interested in the modern, g-d-free, clean shiny secular religious studies will find a useful text here.Those complaining about his lingistic machinations simply have not been plunged into the rather absurdity that populates the majority of religious studies. It is not an ""easy read"" as one would read say non-fiction for enjoyment, but, by far, much more lucid and approachable than other writers."
1,In other words.....,"Peter Berger's ""The Sacred Canopy"", while containing some insightful ideas, are too muddled down with Berger's personal terminology to be considered an interesting read. Does Berger point out some interesting and intriguing thoughts? Yes. But that's not the argument here. I consider myself an intelligent, university-educated individual, but Berger makes up his own words, comes up with entirely new meanings for existing terms, and throws in as many Latin terms as he can in one sentence, that simply trying to comprehend one sentence becomes a chore. Moreover, each chapter feels redundant with ideas expressed in previous areas throughout the book. Berger's inflated language gives the reader a feeling of his pompousness and self-importance. If you'd like the condensed version of the book, here it is: Religion was/is created by man as a ""sacred canopy"" to give us meaning as human beings, but we forget that religion is man-made and thus give power to religion to control us. The End."
1,If it's not REQUIRED do NOT buy it!,"I have never written a bad review...ever, but this book was SOOOO useless. It was a required read for a higher level religion class I was taking and this book almost forced me to change my major (and I'm NOT even a religion major!). The language was COMPLETELY over my head, over the head of the TA, over the head of every person I asked to help me decipher the language. I understand that this doesn't make a ""bad book"" but it is the perfect example of useless academia; the author wrote this book for the sake of sounding intelligent to his contemporaries. We get it...you're smart and you want to alienate those who aren't as smart as you! Lesson learned. I was almost in tears every time I had to pick it up. I started to develop anxiety as a direct result of HAVING to read this book. If you are still having/ wanting to buy this book, pop on over and buy yourself a dictionary, a thesaurus, and a BIBLE. Trust me-you will need them."
3,Interesting read,"This book is very well written though, sometimes the age that it was written in makes it hard to understand. Berger likes to use large and little used words so having a dictionary on hand may be useful at times."
1,Most of This Book is NOT About MSP Airport!!,"It seems that only about 36 out of the 208 pages of this book are really about MSP. The rest?!? Mainly profiles/PR fluff pieces about local companies that are probably located near the airport. Also, a section telling you about all the great things the Twin Cities have to offer. Looks more like something that should've be given-out to companies that were considering relocating their operations to Minneapolis-St. Paul. For me, definitely not a book that belongs on my aviation bookshelf. If you want to get this book, don't fork-out alot of $$$!!"
4,good but...,great footage of some great surfers. enjoyed the story and the movie but i was disappointed in what i thought would have been a great opportunity to explore the real meaning behind the idea to travel the world with a couple of young surfers. the message was spoken but not acted out nearly as much as i would have hoped.good stuff at any rate!
2,Walking on Water.,The scenery was nice with all the waves and the different parts of the country. I was looking for more of a story line than a documentry. It would have been better to learn more about the boys and the fellow that went on the trip with them and their families.
3,A good amount shorter than 6ft,"I'd recommend buying a longer cord to other people. I got this and tried it for a setup. I was wondering why it didn't reach, so I measured it. It was short by a good amount. Almost by a 1ft."
3,Is it a Belkin?,"This power cord works fine and the price was great, but I do not believe that it is a Belkin. In my opinion it is just a cheap generic"
3,Pretty standard cord,Plain cord. I don't know what else to say about it except that it was cheap and that it works.
5,This is a Power Cord,"It works, it's long, it's tough, it's high quality material, my chiwawa is not going to be chewing through this. If your looking for a power cord that just does its job, then get this one. You can't find a better AC Adapter Power Cord."
3,good true story movie,"i like it, i notice that some of your movie were more pricey than the store even with the tax. but this story its not same the one i been watched in cable tv."
4,One of the best shows on television,"Well-written, well-made production of real life murders committed by women. Originally aired on ID (Investigation Discovery), this is a must-have for anyone fascinated by serial killers, female murderers, abnormal psychology and history. Well-known experts like Candice DeLong and Dr. Janis Amatuzio give interesting analysis. What sets this show apart is its finely-balanced drama and fact."
3,Longivity,"I have owned the Armitron 408108 for a two-three years. My only problem is that the wrist band (short part) broke and I don't know where to get a replacement. It looks a little complicated to change it. Love the colors of the watch when lit up. It is a little complicated to change the time and date settings, so read the instructions carefully and don't lose them so you can refer back to them. I just wish I could find a new band instead of buying a new watch."
5,Must read for anyone intersested in State politics,"Absolutely brillant! I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Against the tide."" Mrs. Keysterling held office during an interesting period in SC politics. The book provided great insight into many of the issues affecting South Carolina and the nation. I highly recommend it."
5,Not much to go wrong,There's not too much to go wrong with this adapter. I used it connect an early 90's AT keyboard to a PS/2-to-USB adapter connected to my Windows 7 laptop. It was immediately recognized and worked without any difficulty.
2,Tuneless Flurry Of Sound,"I DO like thrash, it's just that I expect something memorable to hold onto. In this case, Devastation has the technical musicianship down, but at the sacrifice of tonality and memorability.As I listened to this album, I noticed a blur of noise, lots of super fast riffing and drumming, but the vocals were monotonous and tuneless shouting. If I ever cared about the words, as if to follow some kind of story, I couldn't hear enough distinct words within the singer's bark to tell what he was talking about.I heard a few hints of South of Heaven era Slayer, maybe a dash of Anthrax and even Suicidal Tendencies, but not enough to say they are imitating any of them.This is just too extreme for my tastes, and I like extreme music. It just has to have something memorable or something to keep my interest and Devastation, at least on this album, doesn't fill the bill. Not recommended."
2,No sub-titles,"There were no English sub-titles, disappointed that I was unable to understand the conversation and could only try tofollow the action"
2,I would not recommend this movie,"This movie is just to silly, couldn't hold my attention for to long,even with Shahrukh in it, who I think is a wonderful actor."
3,Christmas is Always by Dale Evans Rogers,"The online review of the book did not say that the cover was missing....that makes the outside of the book in my opinion, as the hardback book is just plain with nothing on it and I was planning to give it as a gift. The contents are okay though. Thanks."
3,snagless snagged,I was able to snag this cable on one of my first few attempts. It is not completely snagless. It should be called almost snagless.
3,Patch cables are NOT patch cables are NOT patch cables,"Of course not all patch cables are interchangeable although many of them are very similar. Belkin cables are very well made but suffer from being wound up way too tight in the packaging.I laughed, I cried, I patched equipment into my network."
2,"Did not include many wire projects, mostly reed and cords","good book if you want to weave cords and reeds, but not wires-which I wanted to do.Interesting ethnic triballooking projects."
1,"""Fabulous"" Woven Jewelry","I was so disappointed in this book. I really, REALLY like wire weaving and thought I would learn some new techniques in this book. It advised that it was with ""fiber and metal"", so I assumed there would be some fiber probably woven in with the metal or a few fiber projects. BUT NO! Half of this book could be considered basket weaving! Most of the project involved Black Ash wood or Reeds! Even the projects that used wire were sloppily twisted/""woven"" projects...none of the wire weaving techniques with original ideas or an added twist. I strongly suggest you check this out at a library to see what you are getting before spending a dime on this book."
2,better for fiber artists and crafters than jewelers,"Best thing in the book was the cover photo. I think that most people think of metal and colored glass, stones, etc when they think of making jewelry. This book had little to interest someone who wanted to make or learn something like that-but my friends who are weavers, or who knit, LOVED it. My friends who make jewelry hated it.It is possible to do all of these fiber techniques with metal instead of fiber, (ie: Arlene Fisch, Mary Lee Hu, Barbara Berk, etc.) and that is what I thought the book would be about. It was disappointing. I loved the piece on the cover."
1,Very disappointed,"I found this book very disapointing. I think it was about 99% metal and 1% fiber, and since I am a fiber artist, I found very little of use to me. I think the title is misleading, and the picture on the cover is probably the best piece in the book. I wish I could return it! If I had been able to thumb through the book before purchase, I never would have bought it."
4,A really eclectic selection of materials,"Before I read this book, I had not considered how basketry techniques and materials might be applied to jewelry. Wire, metal sheets, paper and found objects are also used. Very good illustrations and a nice selection of projects. This book really expanded my horizons."
3,Great for Ideas,"Interesting and informative on some ways to weave, but I think the book tried too hard to appeal to a large audience. I bought the book because it billed itself as a metal and fiber book, but most of the projects contained within are fiber related and there are not many true metal projects shown. If you are resourceful and use your imagination you can translate some of the projects and adapt them to your needs. Overall a nice book with pretty pictures and some useful information, but too scattered in scope to really be worthwhile."
4,Great Kit but bigger than I thought,"This kit has it all and it all works great. The size of the kit is larger than I imagined. But how else do you get that all in. I have ended up taking my favorite pieces to teach with because I do not ""own the room."""
1,This product is NO LONGER AVAILABLE! Don't buy it!,"I bought this product November 2009 and got my package today. It was 12 expo markers, no kit, no cleaner and no eraser. I called [...]about it because that's who ships it and they said the wrong picture was on amazon.com. I told them that was weird because other reviewers obviously got the right thing as reflected in their reviews. He said basically they don't sell that any more and just haven't changed the picture to reflect that. Well that's just great. Now I've got a freaking package in the mail that has to go back. What a pain in the butt. Horrible customer service! Will never buy from [...] again!!"
1,stupid cd,"What a bad cd. This is really bad, i mean really bad. The song the blood and the sweat is terrible, and the rest of the songs are to. Don't get this cd, get a real cd from a real band."
5,Hilarious and wrong.,"I love it when you watch a show and laugh at something while saying ""oh, that is just so wrong!"" Arrested Development is full of a variety of joke styles, slapstick, dark humor, VERY subtle jokes, throw-away one liners, whatever you like, I believe you will find it here. The jokes build on themselves, so that the more you watch the show, the funnier they are - especially with repeated viewings.The extras are fun, I liked the wrap-up of Season 1 (though I'd already seen it). The outtakes are funny, but I really bought this just to watch the episodes over again."
5,Amazing,"If you havent watched this show yet, get out from under your box and realize what your life was truly meant to be about."
5,Undiscovered,This series is hilarious and hope they bring it back! Definitely a must watch if you like any of Jason Bateman's work.
4,Really enjoy the show,"I'm late to watching this, but found it enjoyable. Neat to see all the stars when they were so young."
5,Pure Genius!,"This is the funniest show ever. Be sure to watch Season 1 first, since there are a lot of jokes that relate to previous things, but even on it's own, it's hysterical. The episode titled ""Motherboy XXX"" is so hilarious I can't even describe it, and every other episode is just as great.The best writing and the best ensemble cast are just two pieces of this comedy gem. I can't even pick a favorite character because they're all so funny. The Bluths somehow are so dysfunctional, selfish, and insane that you may not like them very much, but you will definitely love them.The show deserves every award it's received and then some, and it definitely deserves better treatment than it's gotten from the Fox network. Um, marketing? Hello? You might want to think about trying it sometime. If it wasn't for DVD I never would have seen this show, and I'm well informed about TV and the entertainment industry. SAVE OUR BLUTHS!"
5,THE BEST COMEDY EVER MADE IN AMERICA,I don't know how the powers that be can even think about canceling this show it's fantastic.It's the best show America has ever made.Every episode is full of laugh out loud moments.Go and buy the dvd now.
4,Nothing Wrong With This Development,"This show would have to be one of the funniest shows that I have ever watched!!!! The acting is superb and the script you cannot fault.This show manages to be so politically incorrect although it doesn't appear overally offensive, it is mainly the characters stupidity that makes the the joke even funnier."
5,Best show ever,"I love it so much. The writing, the cast and acting... It has become a close friend. I watch it when I have free time, when I'm cleaning house, etc. I own a lot of DVDs, and this is definitely one of the most prized."
5,"It seems I blew my wad on a dry run, and now I have something of a mess on my hands.","This is hands down the best comedy currently running today. If it isn't the non stop word play that will get you, or the running gags and catch phrases, it will have to be the acting. The entire cast is sublime. Either way, enough gushing. Just buy this, rent it if you have to. It's good, believe me, and all the other people writing about it. Well except that guy that said sucked, who ever he was."
4,Season 2,"Fun and interesting. 1st and 2nd season did well, last season got to be a little forced , like they were running out of ideas"
5,One of the best American T.V. shows,"The series is one of the best comedies made for network television. Many subtle jokes that you may miss the first time, but catch viewing again and great one liners that have you on floor laughing."
5,Best Comedy Show on Television,"I hardly ever write reviews for DVDs/CDs/Books....but I have to share just how amazing Arrested Development is with the world.It seriously is THE BEST COMEDY SHOW on television - I'd say the best since Seinfeld, and it's not far behind it. Purchase both seasons of this sitcom, and I PROMISE.....You will not be disappointed. I've hooked all my close friends onto AD. Don't miss out!"
3,October 11th? WTF?,"I'm sure this DVD will be hilarious, but I have to remove TWO STARS because of the release date. The 3rd season begins Sept. 19th, but those of us who missed the show's second season now have to wait a month before we can catch up, and go into the third season without knowing everything about the second. Boo! Bad form, Fox!"
4,best series ever!,"This is a sad but necessary substitute, now that the show is off the air. What a loss, but what a great show!"
5,I am anticipating the release!,Season One was INCREDIBLE. What a hysterical show. More people really need to watch it. I cannot wait for the second season. The third season is already insanely funny and the writers are ingenious.
2,entertaining but...,Entertaining but a little too dumbass for my taste. I could barely crack a smile even on the best scenes.
5,The Best Show on Television,"This is the best show on television!I hope Fox does not cancel airing season 3.The acting and writing on the show is excellent. Great Cast, great episodes, truly one of the best television series ever.Everyone should buy season 1 and 2, you WILL enjoy it.It also only gets better each time you watch it.Fantastic DVD!-James"
5,Brilliant! Genius! etc..,"Lindsay: ""Hey, look who's ridin' a hog in the rear view mirror""Michael: ""GEORGE MICHAEL!!!""I bet I've seen that bit 50 times and I still laugh as hard as Idid the first time I saw it.My daughter and I are still depressed about the fate of AD. This show was something special, and we miss it...Buy the DVD's. Give them to someone who has never seen the show. Tell them to watch it without any distractions. They will be hooked. Guaranteed!"
5,Beyond Funny...,"If you like to laugh you must watch this series. In order to truly grasp its comedic genious buy season one and watch it straight through. I can't beleive it was cancelled. So sad... A friend lent this to us and my puppy decided to use it as a chew toy. So I bought it as a replacement. Buy it, if you have regrets you are not human!"
5,Best show on Television!,"This is the funniest show on television and one of the only programs worth the 30 minutes. Great cast, great plots, great commentary. Many people won't get this, especially the desperate housewives/oc crowd. It's brilliant & clever and might prove difficult for the average american to grasp. It's hard to believe that something this good actually made it to a third season. Let's hope for a fourth!"
5,One of my favorite shows!,"I find Arrested Development to be a quirky, intelligent, refreshing comedy. The characters are well thought out and rounded and work well with each other. I can honestly say there isn't a character that I don't find funny or enjoy and that's rare for a sitcom.I was (and still am) disappointed that they didn't continue the show and still hold out a hope that they will pick it up again sometime!"
1,Feeble characters and plot.,"""Desire Under the Elms"" is an emotionless play. The characters express a bout-full of emotions at one given time, and then are impassive another given time. I had to force myself to finish the play - it was extremely trying. O'Neill wrote a play with a plot that could have been summed up in five pages. Personally, I think this is a play that should only be read - never performed. To see it performed would be too taxing and bland. I do not recommend."
5,My favorite pens.,"I love these pens. I first used these pens at work a few years ago and now that I am retired, they are still my favorite for precise and neat writing. My daughter says that they smear when she uses but I think she might hold them in different position then I do. They do not smear for me."
2,Bleed when wet.,"I wrote a letter, I sat the letter down, 10 minutes, by the door. When I was getting ready to leave, I noticed that I splashed some water on the letter, when I was washing my hands. The drops of water blurred the words it landed on. Not sure how long you have to wait for ink to dry, but 10 minutes, I would think to be long enough?The pen writes ok, with a few ink skips here an there. The pen handle is sturdy for my hard-writing style.Nice Pen, but the Ink is the soul, I would think that is what the company that makes these would aim for quality for."
3,Good but can use some improvement,"The pen is good in 0.5, but it can get a bit sluggish/scratchy. Then again my writing is quite analogous to that of ""chicken scratch."" Regardless I feel like I have to work too hard to make any mark upon my paper."
5,Fine Point Pen,Extra fine point for precise lines. No smudges. Great for writing and/or drawing. I use them to fill out log sheets with carbon copy. Work great.
5,Now my favorite pen,"Great grip, smooth flowing ink. It all cuts down on carpal tunnel because I don't have to press as hard.Extra fine point means I can write very small, but not smear or run."
5,Great for everyday use,Most comfortable and precise gel pen I've used in a long time. Definitely recommend :)
5,Perfect Pen,"It allows me to write small, smoothly, and quickly. It lasts a long time and there are plenty in this pack. They don't leak. Highly recommended pen."
2,Ink quality has diminished,"While searching for a pen to write with one day I stumbled upon an old Pilot G2 pen I forgot I had. I loved it. It wrote smoothly, without skipping, and put down a nice, solid dark line. When the ink got closer to the bottom I decided to purchase some ink refills.The difference is night and day. With the new ink refill the pen writes scratchily and seems to tire my hand out more while writing. Plus, the ink quality is not the same. In a side-by-side comparison with the old ink, the new one is not quite as dark and there's a subtle smear line through each ink stroke. Rather than a completely smooth line.It seems like the quality for a lot of pens and pencils have been decreasing over recent years. I'm sad to say that it appears Pilot G2 pens have followed in this same trend.On another note, I have found that Pentel Energel pens write similarly to the way the old G2's did. However, I think the pens themselves are ugly. But that's maybe a minor trade-off to some."
5,great writing,I started with the .07 g2 a little too thick fro all the tiny spaces to fill on documents medical ones I write all day the g5 is very good I purchase bulk when I can and have noticed the same with a few duds I also write kanji it does the job very well I wish they would look at QC a little more closely
3,The best when they work!,"I agree with the writer above. These are the absolute best pens out there, and I'm picky, but out of a pack several will be duds!"
5,Excellent!,"I recently discovered these pens and love them. I had been using Uni-ball gel pens but found those to run out of ink too quickly. Even though I could still see plenty of ink in the pen the uni-balls stopped writing. Someone else in my household bought a bunch of these Pilots and I decided to give them a try. These Pilots write better and are more smooth. For some reason, they seem more flimsy and are lighter than the Uni-balls. Now, only time will tell if they last longer, but for now I really like them."
2,"Great color, but NOT smear proof!","I'm a medical student so I take lots of notes and I like to use different colors to help me outline topics and draw my eyes to certain areas for quick review. The Pilot G-2 pens have GREAT colors, and they write smoothly.But I do not know how people can say they are water resistant and smear proof. I'll carry notes in my backpack with a coffee or a bottle of water and a few drops of liquid gets on my notes or flashcards. Or I'm just studying at my desk and some water drops get on them. What happens? wherever the water runs is totally illegible, it's like this is washable ink and any liquid washes it out. That's no good for me because I need my notes to review long-term. Now I'm looking for normal ball point pens that write as smoothly as these but won't run with water."
3,IF it works...,"I absolutely LOVE these pens...IF they work! When you buy a package, you never know how many will be duds! When they work, they are smooth and the ink flows freely. I'm starting to reach a point though where I'm not willing to pay so much for cool pens to have several of them malfunction. Not sure if the ones that actually work are worth that price."
5,fever,I am from a past generation. Born in 1934. I had the chance to follow Peggy Lee for a number of years durning her life. The book helps me clearify some of the missing parts of her life. I love Peggy Lee and I have enjoyed the book.
3,Peggy Lee's early recordings,"Wish there had been more info and/or details of her early recordings with Capitol and the Modern Jazz group, especially with Dave Barbour and Singletary doing Ain't Goin' No Place. However, the book as a whole is a feast of jazz inter-connections and clues to personality idiosyncrasies, in both Lee and many others."
4,Thorough bio,"Richmond is obviously a fan, and his effusiveness becomes a bit overbearing at times. Nevertheless, this is a very detailed bio, with lots of interesting musical / historical information.One small gripe: Not enough info about all the great musicians who backed her, especially drummers (Stan Levy, Jack Sperling). On a lot of the recording sessions, all the musicians are named except the drummer."
2,Melodramatic view of her life,"I couldn't get into this book. Richmond's style of writing with extraneous detail and flamboyancy left me bored. I felt as if he was constantly inflating Lee as ""the BEST"" female singer of the time period."
3,Pretty decent...,"Decent size and what feels like durable corduroy-like covering add up to a good value. It's a bit over-stuffed as delivered, so removing some of the ""beans"" makes it more comfortable."
3,good for kids,"i bought two of these for my living room. the kids love it.it's not substantial enough for adults though.after a week or so, the beads really deplete/flatten and the whole bag looses it's 'oomph'.but the kids love to roll around in it/jump on it. it's light weight - you can play fight with them.i bought a 5ft cozy sac (with memory foam) after for myself - which the adults LOVE."
4,An interesting look at alcoholism,"This book, which is mostly based on actual experiences of the author's life, looks into the trials of two characters who have lived with an alcoholic parent. One, turns to alcoholism himself, while the other abstains from alcohol all together.The book is about Scott, whose father was an abusive alcoholic, and Jamie, whose family life is happy and well adjusted.The book shows a comparison between the two people to reflect how much alcoholism can destroy a family.Look for her other book: Anytime but Now, Anywhere but Here."
3,Better off reading it,"I have watched Chapter One, and will not be watching any more. The graphic novel has all of the same imagery, narration and dialog, made better by my own mind's eyes and ears, that even this competent translation into semi-animation could only hope to achieve.Be aware: although the narrator's voice is quite good, I completely lost my suspension of disbelief when he spoke for Laurie Jupiter. I wondered, when I bought this, whether they'd have voice actors, since no credits were given for such.As much as I admire the effort to produce this, I can't give it better than a 3, and that only for technical merit rather than entertainment value.READ THE GRAPHIC NOVEL BEFORE THE FILM COMES OUT NEXT YEAR!"
3,"Great comic, so so reading","You can download episodes of this on iTunes right now. The first episode is free. Please check it out before buying this. It's a great presentation visually, however the reader does all the voices, and when he does the women characters, it was a little unnerving to me. If it didn't bother you, then this may be a good way to get ready for the movie."
2,Lots of potential but...,"Not having any prior knowledge of Watchmen I thought this would be fun to watch. The ""motion comic"" concept is cool and i liked it all the way up to the part where the women speak. Apparently they only have one narrator. Multiple narrators would make this much better."
5,"A ""must own""!","Watchmen: the Motion Comic brings the most epic comic book to life. For you cynics out there...trust me, Juice Films, Jake Strider Hughes and his team get it RIGHT! You will be amazed. You can download all 12 episodes on iTunes right now as well. The ""one actor's"" voice takes about an episode or two to get used to and then, you will drop in.This will be a favorite of mine for a long time to come."
3,Containing Original drawings of the books + Interesting animation + Only one-voice narrating = 3 stars.,The GOOD- Containing Original drawings of the books- The animation does add value to the books. It makes them like a cartoon movie than still pictures. It's interestingThe BAD- Only one-voice narrating.It's very annoying to hear an animated woman figure speak with a man's voice! It significantly reduces the entertaining value of these DVDs.It's still worth watching.
2,"Excellent visuals and adaptation, terrible voice acting.","I enjoyed the ""Watchmen Motion Comic"" very much until it became clear that Silk Spectre sounded like a tranny. Tom Stechschulte has no business playing a woman. It reflects very poorly on the producers of this movie that they couldn't hire a single female voice actor."
5,And a Motion Comic is exactly what you get...,"Excellent, simply excellent. Just enough movement has been added to make it seem like old-style animation. Beautiful art, great narration and music."
5,GREAT WAY TO SEE WATCHMEN,"I was surprised at the quality of this production. Colors are bright, panels are from the graphic novel and take up the whole 47"" screen, music is excellent. In my humble opinion I think it's another way to enjoy Watchmen."
3,Watchable,"Nice rendition of the comic graphic novel. Excellent for those who can't handle the book well for some reason (e.g. having movement disabilities). Motion is an intriguing add. Not really necessary if you own the book, but cute. Buy the set of all 12 and it can be watched like a DVD, giving you a movie-like experience. Single episodes work well thru iTunes and Windows Media Player. One major flaw - there is only a single male narrator, even for female voice parts, and this is unsatisfying. Also, the narrator's voice is too flat, using barely any inflection - this doesn't work well in many spots. Rating this a touch over 3 stars."
4,The comic moves!,"Great for any fan of the book. Just be aware that all the character voices are done by the same man, much like an audio book. My only complaint is that this doesn't include the post-chapter articles that the book does. Be sure to READ THE BOOK TOO!!!"
5,an excellent package that breathes new life into the original story,"Clocking in at about 6 hours, with a half hour dedicated to each issue, this Motion Comic covers all the ground of the original book. the motion is done very well, as are the sound effects and narration.unforturnately there is only one male narrator, it would've been nice if there were a few, especially a female to play silk scarlet and her daughter. its my only complaint about this package, and given the superb story telling and character developement of this amazing story, its a small complaint.if you are a really huge fan and already own the book, this would be still be a great purchase, as well as anyone without the book whos feeling a little lazy. the narration/movement does make it easier to get through some of the really slow parts."
1,Must read the paper version,"While this is theoretically a really cool way to enjoy the graphic novel (retaining the original illustration, but filming it like we're walking through the book), as well as beautiful music in the background), they do not tell you that this version is HEAVILY EDITED. The lazy reader's way out had so much potential, but the producers of this ""direct from page to screen"" endeavor completely ruined it by taking out random chunks from the page."
4,Dr. Girlfriend?,"I didn't realize Dr. Girlfriend from The Venture Brothers would be playing all of the female roles. This of course refers to the V/O actor Tom Stechschulte who plays and narrates every part. He actually does an outstanding job throughout. I was 100% skeptical that this idea (as well as animating the panels of the revered graphic novel) would work, but it turns out really nice. I got pulled in and ended up watching the whole thing. This is a nice companion to the comic."
4,"Great product, should have used a female voice over","Motion comics has been around for a while, but having something this complete and with voice over is a nice offer. Motion comics does not equal to animations you see on TV. It is meant to be viewed like an actual graphic novel, page to page, and in this case, added a book on tape narration with it.I enjoy the voice acting a lot but DC could have easily get a female voice to do the female parts. It will add so much more dimension to the final product at very little added cost. I think the producer really dropped the ball on what could have been a masterpiece. I would give it a 5 star otherwise.Hope they can release more titles like this!"
5,Smooth.....,These are great pens. They are very smooth writers. They don't leave smudges like some gel pens and the grip is very comfortable.
5,best pen,"the blue fine (0.7) is a perfect combination of ink flow, thickness, color, and ergonomics. and price too. writes well on cheap notepad paper, no gaps. the best office pen I've used, regardless of price."
5,My Favorite Pens,"What can you say about pens? You either like them or not.I came across one of these pens when visiting a friend in his office.Since I could not raid their supply cabinet, I decided to order for myself.I like the bold line, easy flow, retractable so you are not always losing the caps.As far as ordering and delivery - easy, fast, good condition.There is supposedly also the same pen out in a 1.0 width.Will be looking for that one."
4,can't go wrong,"been using G2's since they came out but hated how the clip would always break off, making the barrels somewhat ""disposable"". i bought these for my mom. personally, i purchased the limited edition metal barrel G2's when they were still only available overseas."
1,buyer beware,"I read the product information for this and thought they were .7 (medium point). When they arrived, they were fine point. There are some discrepancies between my current pen and the ones I received. I think these are not real Pilot brand pens. I would not order again."
1,I don't really see the point of this book,"A ""pocket"" book should be pocket size. This book is too big to be a pocket reference, but too small/thin to be a truly useful Windows book. It just doesn't seem ""right."" The writing was geared more for beginners, so I don't understand why ""administrator"" is in the title. But, that's Microsoft for you..."
2,"For end users, not for administrators","This book should not have administrator in the title. This book is basically a Windows 98 pocket user's guide that has been updated for XP. This book is a good read if you've never used a Windows computer. I am relatively new to XP. I have a good understanding of how to use all previous versions of Windows. There is very little in this book that I couldn't have figured out by just playing with an XP machine for a couple of hours. As an administrator, I was disappointed that the book did not go into any detail about XP deployment or security. Like most Microsoft Press books it leaves you with many unanswered questions and provides you with information that is comparable to what you get in the Windows help files."
3,Original but bias,"When I was in China, I read a review on this book, sayingC. T. Hsia was funded by C.I.A when writting this book.""the book is bias and full of hatry to Communist China"" thereviewer said, ""that is why this book is banned in China"".I was so curious that the first book I checked out from a U.S.Alibrary was this one. I am disappointed since Hsia is reallybias and sometimes paranoia.He really did not understand the huge difficulty all Chinesewriters faced in the past 100 years. And sometimes I reallydoubt whether he is a Chinese at all? When he sat there laughingat Communist writers, did he realize those were of the sameorigin of his parents and himself?In this sense, this book is just common, not great, since itis lack of love and forgiveness, the basic elements of all greatworks."
2,Not exactly what I was looking for,"People mostly use 80 conductor cables for hard disks nowadays, leaving 40 conductor cables for things like DVDs/CD/Floppy drives.When I saw this product being described as a ""hard disk"" cable, I assumed it is 80 conductor. I tried to go through the product description, but couldn't find this information anywhere. I know technically this cable can be used for hard disks, so this description is not really misleading. Just a little incomplete in my opinion.In any case, I ended up buying CBI-IDE133 - Ultra ATA 133 IDE Ribbon Cable, IDC40 x 3, 18"" from microbarn.comWhich is a clearly better product/deal."
5,Comfortable and Classy,"There my favorite pants to wear. I can wear them out, with a dressy top, or just lounge at home in them."
4,comfortable,"I was pleasantly surprised. At first, I thought the material was cheesy but once I put them on; I noticed right away how comfortable they are and they look much better on the body than in the box. Very comfortable and I feel that they can be worn with anything"
1,A Real Sleeper,ROMAN SPAIN is a monotonous collection of facts. Look elsewhere for well-written history that tells a story.
1,Cheap Tinny Junk,These earclip headphones have absolutely no bass response. They sound tinny and must be driven at max volume to get any sound at all out of them. Don't waste your money on these like I did. They aren't even worth the postage to return them. I just threw them in the trash.
5,Handiest thing ever!,"I use a Mac, and everyone knows Mac lovers keep their keyboards. The one thing is that if you use a Mac keyboard, they have the shortest cord ever. So I got this and it worked like a charm, giving me that extra distance between my Mac and my keyboard on my desk; keeping the wires off the top of my desk."
1,WARNING: NOT USB 2.0,"Be forewarned. This cable (Belkin 6ft F3U134-06) is not a USB 2.0 cable. I'm looking at the package that Amazon shipped to me. It clearly states 12 Mbps transfer speed, not the 480 Mbps of a USB 2.0. I'm sending this falsely-advertised junk back!"
2,False Advertising!,"Instead of the pictured Belkin cable, I got a flimsy generic cable. Total and complete rip off."
2,"Good product price, excessive shipping charges.","Cables work just fine, price seemed to be excellent, my own fault for not looking at the shipping since it was not an Amazon product. As much online shopping as I do, I just fell into a lull because I was shopping at Amazon. $30.00 for a $5.00 pack of cables seems a bit out of line. Assume the price is the bait and it's made up for with the shipping costs. They did not hide it, my bad for not paying attention."
3,"Not what I ordered, but I still enjoyed it","I ordered the temple looking decor, but I got a completely different replica instead. I was upset at first, but realized the one they sent me was pretty cool too. It is really colorful and really well made and looks great in my tank! I didn't contact the seller about the product, so I can't say whether or not they would have sent me the right replica instead."
2,Kindling by Nevil Shute,I am a Nevil Shute fan but found this book predictable and not appealing at all..... seemed very forced and contrived .... somewhat depressing too.... it might have a happy ending if I can make myself read it to the end....
3,3.5 stars - a solid Nuclear Assault-style thrash album,"1990's In the Red was the debut album from CIA, which was essentially a solo project by Nuclear Assault drummer Glenn Evans (with an occasional assist from his bandmates). It's not surprising then that CIA sounds more or less like Nuclear Assault. The vocals aren't quite as good and the guitar work is a bit uneven, but this is still an album that will get you headbanging. The hardcore elements give the album some crossover appeal, though it's not quite in Uncle Slam territory.It's not essential by any means, but In the Red is a solid enough thrash metal album with some really good moments. If you're not already a serious Nuclear Assault fan, there's probably no reason for you to bother with this album, but if you dig Nuclear Assault's sound, chances are you'll dig CIA as well."
3,For fans of Nuclear Assault.,"This is a side project from Nuclear Assault's Glenn Evans. It's not too dissimilar to Nuclear Assault's style of thrash metal, but leans a little more on the punky side (mostly due to the vocal style). Glenn (the drummer for NA) plays the majority of instruments with just a little help from his mates in Nuclear Assault, et al. I remember seeing C.I.A. open up for Nuclear Assault during the Handle With Care tour, and it was basically the guys from NA with makeshift disguises (Danny Lilkler played drums and had styrofoam cups taped over his eyes). Anyway, this is only a MUST have if you are a Nuclear Assault enthusiast (like I am) or somebody who likes buying cheap metal CDs from the secondary sellers to add depth to your metal collection (also like me)."
5,Nice,"Not as pictured, they are all white. They are guitar picks, what else is there to say?? I got these to fill an order to the full $25 so it would be free shipping. They are held in your hand and they strum the guitar strings. Am i at the number of words yet for this review?? Oh, yes - I am. Do you want guitar picks? Then, this is what you are looking for - white guitar picks."
3,A little light,"Set I bought for a little more money are staples had richer colour. Oh well. Ya win some, ya lose some."
5,Expo should be paying me!!,I go through over 100 of these markers per school year and I can't say enough how superior they are to the low odor and other white board marker brands. These also last much longer than the others.
4,An unexpected prize,"The Girl With the Hatbox"" is a cute, charming silent comedy of Russiangirl who travels between her home in the country and an apartment ownedby a greedy, rich couple in Moscow.She meets a poor student with nowhere to go, and ends up marrying himto give him the right to stay in the apartment although the marriagestarts as just a platonic arrangement.Lots of hi-jinx ensue, almost all well acted, and I found myselfenjoying it way more than I expected to.Yes, there are some over the top performances, and a couple of unneededsub-plots, including our heroines cruel ignoring of the post man who isin love with her, but overall this is a breezy, sweet comedy, wellworth watching."
4,Emotionally Intense Display of Human Behavior,"Adrian Brody and Forest Whitaker are both great actors in their own right and the roles they play in The Experiment are as convincing as it gets. The Experiment is a sad reminder that humans aren't that evolved. We still carry tendencies of following the herd and going along with the alpha male even though we know what is morally and ethically right or wrong.Given a set of parameters or rules to follow in order to achieve a monetary gain, we lose humanity and succumb to greed, ego and lack of compassion. This is a powerful movie and it is a story that is reminiscent of Lord of the Flies except we're dealing with adults. There are some graphic scenes and you really feel emotional if you get into this movie.Perhaps humans have not evolved far away from chimps but surely lessons like these can help us understand more of how and what not to become."
2,The real experiment is much more interesting,"My sister told me about the movie, seemed interesting. After watching it I was kind of disappointed. I didn't really like it, I felt it lacked reality specially the ending; I suggest watching the real experiment it's much more interesting and real.(...)[...]"
5,Awesome Film,"I wasn't really expecting much from this movie at first watch, not a huge Adrien Brody fan or Forest Whitaker, but in this movie THEY ARE FANTASTIC! This is a remake of a german film called ""Das Experiment"" I'm not a fan of subtitles so I skipped out on that version. However ""Das Experiment"" is based loosley on the ""Stamford Prison Experiment"" and a consequential reality show called ""The Experiment"" from BBC.After about 15 minutes I instantly wondered why this film wasn't in theaters ever. The storyline is very well constructed, the acting again is excellent, and the just over al visceral feel of the movie without being too in your face violent is Terrific. I highly suggest this movie. Everyone in the movie does a wonderful job."
4,The Experiment.,"Very interesting movie. Subject was unusual, not seen it;s like before. Well acted by the main characters, and Forrest Whitaker was excellent. 7 out of 10"
3,Psychological experiment,"The Experiment is based on two sources one is film `Das Experiment' and the other is a book which is turn were inspired by a Stanford University experiment conducted in the 1970's.Basically the film is about a `what happens if `scenario. A group of people are selected from volunteers for an experiment which lasts for two weeks. The objective is to create a prison like environment in which there are two groups, the prisoners and the guards. Although there are rules but these rules are open to interpretation. The acting is great and both Brody and Whitaker are superb. Whitaker breathes life in to his role as the evil guard that at moments one wants to kill him. The film has a slightly weak ending but the editing and runtime save the movie and make it enjoyable. Three stars. 1/27/11"
2,Great until it broke,"I bought this camera about four months ago, and it took beautiful pictures - color quality was much better than the A310 I had previously purchased from Fuji. The small size is great, except that I couldn't find a case that fit it well. Because of this, in my purse it seems that it accidentally turned on (which happens quite easily, unfortunately), which caused the lens to push out against my rigid purse which broke the zoom. I attempted to take it to a Fuji place to get it fixed (I bought it recently enough that it should have still been covered under warranty), but they said that it would cost me over $175 to fix the camera (what was wrong apparently is not covered by the warranty)! I didn't see any warnings about this, and had I realized that this was a possibility, I would never have bought this camera.Summary: great camera, but watch out for it accidentally turning on in tight spaces"
1,Won't work!,"I bought this camera because I've been using a FinePix 2600Z - 2.0 mega pixel for the past three years with gorgeous pictures. I love it . . . But it's soooo clunky. So, with all the great reviews for the F440, I thought how could I go wrong?But, it's not working. After charging the battery that came with it, it has power but the icon shows an empty battery and it won't take any pictures. The manuel does not address this problem. So what's to do?It's so similar as far as menu function to my 2600Z, but it certainly does not perform like it at all. I'm thinking there's either something wrong with the camera - - - or some dumb little thing that just isn't right. So, I really shouldn't give it a rating at all until I know what's wrong. But, I'm not sure what to do - send it back? I certainly won't get any online help from amazon as far as what's wrong. I've never had a problem with their products before - this is a first."
4,cute romance,"This is a fast, fun read. I'd consider it more of a contemporary romance though than a chick lit. I was really looking foward to this book, and wish it had been a bit longer, so we could spend more time with the characters, and go a little deeper."
1,Horrible!!!,"Please don't waste your money on this book. For being a Latina Mary Castillo could not possibly get her Spanish any worse. In one scene the a character says ""deseo besarle otra vez"" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN??? deseo besarte otra vez or te deso besar otra vez COME ON what would a little proof reading hurt anyone?? The story line is weak, characters aren't well developed. Extremely glad I recived this book for free and did not waste one cent on it."
1,Hot Tamara,"All I should say about this book is SAVE YOUR MONEY! Not only is the theme trite and hackneyed, but the worst part is that the author, who is Hispanic,cannot get her Spanish right! How hard can it be in Los Angeles to come up with a competent proof reader? I concede that there are instances in which the author obviously intends the Spanish to be colloquial, but they are far outnumbered by the glaring, blatant mistakes. Using foreign words and phrases just for the heck of it and not providing a treanslation is pretentious enough, but to get it all wrong is impardonable. Given the option, I would not have given this piece of trash even one star, and will certainly avoid buying any other books by Ms. Castillo, although as a general rule I support and enjoy reading modern Hispanic fiction. Mrs. Brooks M. de Cervantes"
2,Hot Tamara doesn't sizzle,"I was very excited about this book because it is rare to find a good latina romance that isn't just fluff and stereotypes. Saying that, this book was disappointing. The sentence structure was jumbled most of the time, and hard to understand. The characters were very underdeveloped to the point of being two-dementional. The real point of the story seemed to be the mother-daughter relationship, and the mother's character was too painfully exaggerated to be realistic. It was very hard to be swept away by this book. I love romances where a woman finds herself, but Tamara's anxious efforts to become more ""independent"" weren't endearing, they were just plain annoying. Don't waste your money."
1,"Bad chick lit ""goes ethnic""","This book has the dubious distinction of being among the worst I've ever read. Was this author even trying? She doesn't seem to understand that just making chick lit ""go ethnic"" doesn't automatically make it any less vapid and pointless. The Mexican family is a cheap cliche, the book is about nothing, the dull plotline is interrupted for a few soft-core porn scenes, and the writing is unequivocally bad from the opening scene discussing Tamara's menstrual period through a character being described as walking ""into her office like something had flown up his butt"". I've seen better prose from 6th graders. Castillo reveals the kind of underachiving readership she seeks when she starts citing Nora Roberts novels. The only advantage to the book's migraine-inducing pink cover is that it might deter people from wasting their money on this frivolous trash."
3,Nice markers,I like these markers but they don't really show up very well on my glass dry erase board. We had to order some liquid chalk markers in hope of it showing up better.
4,Heavy Tunes and Great Cover Art,Awesome! Very heavy Sabbath-like dirges. This is a great reissue by Spitfire and I'm glad they decided to have DiSilvio redo all the cover art and package designs for these olderrealeases. Superior product all around!
4,Smooth writing pen,"It's hard to find this color pen in extra fine point in stores and is definitely cheaper in bulk. The bleed through a regular sheet of notebook paper is more than a regular ball point pen, but you can still read both sides of the page. Writes smoothly."
2,"Love the feel, hate the quality","I was glad to find a bundle of multiple Pilot G2 Retractable Extra Fine in blue. They are often hard to find in extra-fine point in stores.These are my favorite pens to use, and I always have one in my pocket. They are a good balance between scratchiness and runniness. I am able to take 3 months worth of notes per pen as a full time student, which is pretty good value.My biggest issue with this particular purchase was that I had so many pen failures. Out of a pack of 12, I have had 4 or 5 pen tips break on me within the first few weeks of use. Why that is, I cannot be sure of. It certainly isn't the way I use them because I am only taking notes, not jotting or scribbling with great force. I am forced to replace just the tip with previous tips from cartridges that have run out of ink. Of course this does not always work, and I am left with a wasted cartridge. I hope the next set is more acceptable."
5,Industrial hardcore at his peak !,"In my own opinion, 'Force Fed' was, and still is, the perfect balance, between melody and energy/fury, we can find in an 'hardcore album'. Issued in the late eighties, this album contains many 'hits' of the genre ('forgery', 'the taming', 'bought and sold', the amazing 'look up at the sun' and many more...). What a pity it didn't encounteer a largest audience... After all these years, I consider 'Force Fed' beeing an essential both of Prong and the hardcore scene."
2,Old Prong when they were a punk band,"Do not be confused by the release date of this CD ... this is NOT a new Prong CD. It is an old Prong release from the late 80's, back when they were more or less a punk band. It sounds nothing like the last few Prong CDs, which are more in an industrial/metal vein. If you like punk you might like this, but metal fans should look elsewhere (i.e. Cleansing or Rude Awakening)."
5,Brilliant!!,I simply love this scrapbook. It features a list of interesting Star Wars memorabilia and collectibles. The quality of the book is excellent compared to for the price you pay. I highly recommend this to all Star Wars fan.
4,"Before the goddesses, there was Natsumi and Miyuki","Kosuke Fujishima has always known how to draw pretty girls. There's no doubt about that. ""You're Under Arrest"" was Fujishima's manga series before he started ""Oh My Goddess,"" but you couldn't tell it from the artwork alone -- he's a meticulous artist and always so clear with the layouts. The only thing that clues you in to Fujishima's pre-Goddess style is that some of his stories end a little too abruptly in YUA; there's also less depth in the character design. Sometimes you could switch Natsumi with Miyuki with each other and no-one would be the wiser. However, it's still a delightful crime-fighting trip through Tokyo in the unique Fujishima style. Comedy, action, and awesome artwork should all be reasons enough to buy ""You're Under Arrest."""
4,That is a hoot 'n' a holler.,Without question the weirdest cop comic ever. Not since Uncle Buck has a golf swing been so lethal. And Aoi's secret is just too stunning. Check this out!
3,average pen,"The cushion is fairly stiff, it would have been better if it was softer. Also, the metal isn't the highest quality. It is a very light weight pen when I was expecting it to be a bit on the heavier side. The only pro's are the neon blue color and that it writes smoothly."
1,Do NOT buy this book! Do not believe Prima's propaganda!,"You have been warned! Prima simply can not publish a good strategy guide. I have been sorely, sorely disappointed by every single Prima guide I have ever bought or read. Everything in their books you can find on the Internet for free! I can not believe that Prima is allowed to stay in business. Isn't doing what they do some sort of crime? Shouldn't the Federal government intervene? People, people, people, do not reward such lazy, money-hungry, marketing-driven hackery."
5,A great investment manual for teachers,"This book provides great insight into 403(b) investing. Not only does it answer just about every question one might have with concern to 403(b) plan investing, the manual also covers a wide spectrum of financial concepts that should be learned by every investor, not just those who teach."
3,Lackluster audio quality,"I had high hopes for this product. I'd been using a cassette style adapter for my MP3 player and wasn't happy with the normal tape hiss present in that style of adapter.The unit works as described and is fairly convenient to use if you keep the ""cheat card"" of frequencies handy. You must also have a good, solid unused frequency in your area among the ones available on the Voyager. Unfortunately, I don't really have a frequency that's completely clear for it to broadcast through, which results in a fair amount of static and squeals and pops normally associated with AM radio stations.I'm sure this product would work well for people in areas with a lot of clear frequencies, but I've gone back to my cassette adapter. The tape hiss is more acceptable to me than the random poor quality and static I frequently get with the Voyager."
4,Decent item for the price,"Works well in general. Dont expect CD quality, but as good as any FM station as long as there is no local station at the selected frequency. An ipod battery charger feature would have been nice, but thats just a 'nice to have' really. Takes some getting used to for adjusting the volume on the ipod vs your stereo system to get the best sound, works well once you get it just the way you like it."
2,Very disappointed!,I am very disappointed with this product! The quality of sound is absolutely awful when a you play a song that contains some bass or electric guitars! It just sounds distorted. I would definitely not recommend buying this product unless all your listen to is soft music!
1,Very bad,"It worked for about 10 min and then it stopped working. The LED display went off and no FM signal was transmitted again. I tried several power outlets in two cars, it never worked again. Very bad product! Besides, when it worked, the sound quality is BAD!"
1,Poor Design Quality,"Works fine when the saw doesn't pivot in the midlle of a cut. But if the saw binds up in any way, the blade will pivot on the handle causing the blade to skip/stutter and leave additional marks on the wood. Personally, I would buy a one piece pull saw before I would use this saw again."
1,Dull as a butter knife,"I got this from Home Depot and found the blade to be dull. Thus, cuts took forever and were not smooth. I ended up using my regular Stanley wood saw to undercut my door jambs and it work three times as fast as the Irwin saw."
2,broke within a month,"I purchased this MP3 player for my 14 year old and it broke within a month. However, he has also broken 2 others fairly quickly, so I can't say wether it is the products fault, or his."
5,spiritual healing,"ok, i dont consider Death a death metal band. limiting it to that wouldnt be right. chuck schuldiner was always evolving, and changing, and this album shows it. this is the first Death album i ever got, and i love it. good rifs, good drumming, good song structure, and good subjet matter on the lyrics. i mean,this album is what it is, not trying to be anything more, or less, its just perfect. Death had a great carreer, and its sad that Chuck lost his battle with cancer, but i definetly wont forget him , or his music, and its kinda funny saying this, but ""Death will live on forever.""...peace"
3,Not best product for serious bible students,"If you're a serious bible student, don't scrimp with money. Get the exhaustive concordance.The Strongest NIV Exhaustive Concordance (Strongest Strong's)"
2,ALIEN SEX ENCOUNTERS,"Did we really need a second DECOYS? No.Is this one any better than the first? It's really the same movie.Is it any good? Barely. It's more of a comic horror film than straight.Is there lots of t&a;? Yes, but isn't that what this is all about?Will there be a third? What do you think?"
2,LAME,"The movie attempts to combine horror with a teenage sex comedy. It doesn't achieve either. The girls are all those sexy women you never meet in real life. The guys use their cell phones to take pictures of themselves having sex with girls, or in this case aliens with no belly buttons. The movie doesn't deliver on the hype. Go watch Species a second time."
2,ok not the best,"its ok for curry paste, better then the average curry products available at most supermarkets, but i prefer hand brand curry paste, much better, a huge difference, much more flavorful, its all i use now, also as a side note these mae ploy containers are the small ones not the larger ones found in asian food markets. not a good value here."
1,Not very good.,"I don't know if the flavor of this paste is authentic or not but I can definitely say that I don't like it. For some reason the region that I am in just has superb Thai restaurants and this paste doesn't even come close. Not only is it bad while eating the curry, it even has a terrible aftertaste to prolong the fun. I have taken the suggestion of another reviewer to try Hand Brand, we'll see what comes of that."
4,Great taste ... awkward packaging,"First this has great taste and is perfect for making curry. I does have a fair bit of heat to it.My reduction from 5 to 4 stars was due to the way it is packaged. While the picture is in fact what it looks like, the paste itself is not in the tub. But rather it is in a big plastic pouch that is stuffed in the tub. If you leave the paste in the pouch to avoid losing any that won't come out, the pouch cannot be wedged back in (at least not till you use a lot of the paste). And if you take the paste out of the pouch and dollop it into the tub, a lot of the paste stays in the pouch since it is so thick. They really should have just put it in the tub to begin with and then a good plastic seal on the top that could be removed.Oh well ... I'll be rebuying this when I run out as the flavor more than makes up for the packaging."
3,"Works in a pinch, but flavor lacking.","If you don't have the time or energy to make it from scratch, this will do in a pinch. Although I would never serve it to guests. The flavor is just not right. You need to use a very large amount to get any flavor or heat. (Assuming you like spicy food, otherwise, why would you be buying it). It does not taste authentic by any stretch of the imagination, and is more pink than red. If you just want something to make a quick red curry at home, then give it a try. You will still need to add coconut milk. And soy sauce to get the right saltiness."
1,Worked well...until it broke.,"I asked for this item to keep my Zen Micro safe in my purse, and attached to me when I wanted to listen to it while walking around a room or sitting and working. The leather case is great, really protects the player. The con is that the hole for the headphones is intended for a headphone jack that is straight and doesn't bend.Then, after getting this in December, it was breaking by February. Part of the plastic clip broke, but it would still function because the metal spring was held in place. Then, the entire plastic part containing the spring broke and the entire clip fell apart. It does nothing more than protect the player now. We complained to the company and never heard back. I don't recommend this product unless you are using it rarely and not planning on moving much while using it. This case proved useless.I bought the rubber slip case one instead, that detaches from the clip - has kept my player very safe."
5,GAC1-SS OmniFilter,I have bought plenty of these filters from this company and I had two that were in bad shape(all the charcoal was in tiny pieces when installed) and replaced them both with no problems.
2,Overview of Network Analysis,"The title should be called ""An overview of Network Analysis"" or something like that! The book does't teach you anything about basic or detail approach of network analysis, just a overview of the network analysis, to compare with her another wonderful analysis book ""Novell's Guide to LAN/WAN Analysis: IPX/SPX"". Please refer to Scott Haugdahl's Network Analysis and Troubleshooting for a start."
5,Networkanalysis made understandable,"Laura understands what it takes to write about techincal subject in a very understandable fashion. In this pod she explains how to perform network analysis using tools from different vendors.This book is a ""must read"" if you don't want to be mediocre network operator of designer but want to move forward to the top networking."
2,Split by authors?,"This one is a ""pass it"" I really enjoyed the character development in the first half of the book but it seemed as though someone else wrote the second half...or the author was in a huge hurry. Debbe Lee is too strong of a character to believe that she could be ""drugged"" into submission...I could swallow blackmail...but this resolution was a bit too far out there for my liking. A pretend island? I say call the police Debbe...Definitely one author I will not be looking into in the future..."
4,fun book,"I read this book in just one weekend and I loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was the ending. I don't always like cute happy endings if they don't fit the story very well.Having said that, I enjoyed the characters and their relationships. Ms. Dean treated this story with the grace and sensitivity it deserves. Lesbians can find true love too!"
2,No it's not...,"I don't usually write negative reviews - in fact I think this is my first. However - I was moved to write this because I was so disappointed by this novel.For me, the characters are the heart and soul of the novel - and this novel featured CJ as the main character. I never felt that I got to know CJ. She was two dimensional - at best. Supporting characters were a little more fleshed out, but not enough.I'm upset that I spent a lotof money (Australian) on this... when there are so many other great books out there! If you're reading this saying ""what books?"" - try reading some of the published fan fic novels (xena, etc)./end rant"
5,Beautiful!,"For the price, I didn't expect very much, but trusted the Oneida brand, so I went ahead and ordered a set that I planned on using day-to-day. When this set of utensils arrived, I was happily surprised by the quality and sytle. I plan on buying another set so I'll have enough for additional guests."
4,A Great Set,"This is a great set if you need a serving set. I would have preferred a large serving knife, as in other Oneida sets, but this is minor. I recommend it."
4,Not as heavyweight as I would have liked,"After researching multiple sets and reading many reviews, I bought two sets of these as a gift. I have Oneida as my flatware set and I love it. This set isn't as heavyweight as I would have liked and feels a little light and thin to me. The person I gifted it to seems happy with it and feels that it is heavy enough. Otherwise I love the simple style of the set."
1,Not very good quality.,"I didn't notice it was 18/0 when I ordered it from Amazon. The Customer Review made me believe they were good. When I received it and open the box, I was disapointed."
3,good for the price,This set was a decent price for what was received. The discription did not state what the metal content was and I took a chance. I was disappointed to learn that it is 18/0 and not 18/8 or better.
3,Decent but not great,"This was my first set of flatware when I moved out on my own. After years of handwashing and everyday use, the necks of the spoons and tines of the dinner forks started to bend.Since I needed more place settings and at the time was not aware I could go online find the pattern, I replaced Flight with Mooncrest and am INFINATELY happier with the Mooncrest pattern.Mooncrest is twice as heavy, practically destruction-proof, and are holding up MUCH better than the pieces of the Flight set I still have left.Flight is OK for everyday use, but I would never use the same set for casual entertaining because of the use they cannot sustain.Get the Mooncrest pattern if you need a sturdy set that you can interchange with everyday use and casual entertaining."
1,Should have ordered thru Amazon,"I found these on the Amazon website. I had some questions about the item and called Netaya. Since I needed to access their(Netaya) website for the item number I ended up ordering thru their website rather than going back to Amazon. That was 11/28/06. So far the item has not been shipped but my credit card was billed on 12/1/06. Needless to say am very upset. Left a message on their machine and sent them e-mail yesterday; waiting for response. I ended up receiving the earings , not sure if after Christmas ( 2009 now); were very nice and my girlfriend ( now wife!) liked them too."
5,Here is where you start!,"The Absolute Beginners Guide to the Alto Saxophone is exactly that, a guide for the absolute beginner. If you have little or no experience with music or musical instruments this is the place to start. It shows you how to assemble, care for, and blow into your saxophone, as well as showing you the absolute basics to be able to begin to read music. There is a finger chart, and illistrations of the finger positions for playing each note that the book goes through.The CD is extreemly helpful, especially if you are unsure as to how the saxophone is intended to sound. The CD goes through the notes so that you can compare the sound, and it takes you step by step through basic notation. It also helps you get a feel for how to count beats.I have found this guide very helpful for learning on my own. It help in giving me a little direction when all I had was an instrument, an intrest, and a lot of questions."
4,Great - for absolute beginners,"This worked great for me. It was my first introduction to learning saxophone. The play-along CD was helpful. The only disappointment I had was when I had to move on to find more advanced instructional material. It won't last you more than several weeks. That being said, it was a great first step."
5,Reconstructs the dialogue between a believer and a skeptic,"Original research based on original correspondence and photos makes for a unique coverage of a strange friendship between Houdini and Conan Doyle in this excellent biography. Polidoro reconstructs the dialogue between a believer and a skeptic, from their unlikely associations to the rift which ended their friendship. Final Seance is an unusual biographical account for fans of either man."
3,Interesting but dry,"This book was very interesting, but it made for dry reading. Certainly not a page-turner. If you can get through the first half of the book, it gets more interesting toward the end.In addition, the author did not impress me as being an impartial source. It was clear that he agreed with Houdini from the start and he set out to make Conan Doyle look as ridiculous as possible. Perhaps Conan Doyle really was that foolish, but the author was too biased for me to take his word for it."
4,Swiss army knife with flash drive,"Flash drive works well and is recognized without loading any drivers in Windows XP. Knife, nailfile/screwdriver,scissors are a plus to have. Small and very portable. Only complaint would be I think the price is a little steep."
4,Nefertiti - captivating & informative - a must read,"Ever since I saw the Nefertiti exhibit at the Met in NYC, I have been intrigued with who this woman was & her origins. Ms. Tyldesley has answered many of my questions. Her ability to convey her knowledge of this period of Egyptian history is as well done as in her book on Hatchseput. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about strong female regents/rulers & the possible origins of monothesism. It is a worthy addition to my growing Egyptian collection. Kudos!"
2,A Stale Retread of Old Theories,"I swear, it takes a steam shovel to get Egyptologists out of their rut! More of the same old nonsense: Ankeaten ""married"" his two daughters, blah, blah. Nefertiti was a foreign princess, bleh-bleh. Amenhotep III married his daughter too (Sitamun) and fathered Tut and Smenkhare, blabbity-blah. Tyldesley just rehashes the same old crap. Nothing new here."
3,Can we get some new theories?,"All in all, this is a pretty good book, in a textbook-y way. In my opinion, it was mainly a rehash of the popular theories of Nefertiti, and not really anything new and exciting for us to read.Side note to reviewer Ma Ra: If you are so ticked off at Nefertiti looking more Middle Eastern than African, there's a sculptor that's been dead for 3000 years that you'll have to take it up with. Anyone with eyes who has seen Ancient Egyptian art knows that they depicted themselves as more Middle Eastern looking than what modern people consider ""African"". Sounds to me like you're pushing a sterotype."
3,"Good, but Misleading","I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but not for what it is advertised for and labeled as. This is a great book about the Amarna period during the 18th Dynasty, a period for which little information is available. I learned a lot about the religious changes made by Akhenaten (Nefertiti's husband) and a lot about the Pharoh himself.However, there is very little information in this book about Nefertiti herself, probably less the one quarter of it is spent on the queen. So while I liked the book and learned a great deal from it, I feel that the title is misleading at best and at worst a ploy to make it more saleable by the author. After all, everyone has heard about Nefertiti, but few have heard about Akhenaten and the Amarna period."
4,A fascinating read in real-world language,"I wrote a review earlier but it didn't show up. :( Anyways, I am pretty new to egyptology, but I found myself fascinated by Joyce's book. I agree with others, though, who say that her constant references to the numbered index in the back get kind of annoying (and time-consuming). It would be much better if they were printed on the bottom of that present page. Although this book doesn't clear up the mystery of Nefertiti, learning about her husband Akhenatan (sp?) is just as enjoyable. I just ordered another book by Joyce T, ""Daughters of Isis."""
5,Look No Further,This book is a great reference for relevant resumes and cover letters. I will always keep it in my personal library to use and share with others.
4,Reincarnations Find Forgiveness in the Present for the Past,"In this series of dialogues with women visionaries who see themselves as reincarnations of biblical heroines, Ms. Ingram reveals the possibility that the Divine Feminine is emerging in the 21st century through the personalities of spiritual devotees today.Following her subjects through their hypnotic investigation of early Christianity, the author makes clear her point that there is currently a call for the Sisterhood to be found.Written with candor and a lack of personal judgment, this work opens the door of the mind and allows the reader to walk in the shoes of those who have gone before us. Common threads of recollection seem to give credence to these stories and the collective unconscious, or Akashic Records, from which they are drawn.Reviewer: Rev. Dr. Arlene J. Colver, Author of Magdalen's Way and From Whence They Came, Vice President of Lifelight University, Founder and Chaplain of the Society for Universal Concordance"
3,Review of NA XB-70 Photo Chronicle,"Although the photographs are excellent and diverse, showing all aspects of the aircraft, some of the captioning and data is incorrect. Xb-70 Valkyrie: The Ride to Vahalla by Jeannette Remak is much more factually correct."
3,Valkyrie,"Not long enough. While the pictures are in chronological order, some are not especially clear and there isn't really enough description and/or narrative.Nonetheless, it is a good addition to the military historian on one of the more fascinating aircraft constructed."
2,Poorly designed,I am a finish carpenter and I used this coping saw on one project. It is very difficult to use effectively since the blade doesn't tighten enough. There is also some nut on the end that falls off at random times. I suggest using the standard coping saw with the wood handle. If it ain't broke don't fix it.
1,"Picks are good, packaging TERRIBLE","As a beginning guitarist, i love these picks. A friend gave one of these picks to me and I loved playing with them. When I lost the pick i looked to Amazon to buy the same ones. WARNING: packaging is TERRIBLE.The cardboard box that it arrived in was WAY too big. Padding was not needed for something that is barely 2 inches by 4 inches. The plastic bag supposedly containing the picks was cut open on the side. When I opened the box, the plastic bag was underneath the cardboard flap...There was one pick inside the plastic pack and one pick in the box. The other 10 picks were missing, probably fallen out of the box during shipping. Packaging was terrible. Even if the plastic pack was open, if it was placed in a sealed padded envelope instead of underneath of the flap of a cardboard box, i would not have lost over half of my picks. I paid for 12 picks and got 2."
5,Great Picks,I am a beginning guitarist and have tried different thicknesses. I really like the feel of these and the give it has with the strings as I only strum right now. The nylon makes them more durable. I've had a few break but not like the other plastic ones. I went to my local music store to get more and could not find any that were comparable in feel at the same thickness. Many don't even make them this thin.
4,Great thin picks,"I would prefer a slightly thicker pick with my next purchase, but overall very good quality and they feel great too."
4,A Great Start,I dont know who these guys are but they're about to be big! The production behind this albim was surprisingly great. Nasty Girl is really creative to be a sampled song. I would definately reccomend this album to those in doubt!
5,know them,i know these catz tommy G is in fed. bustie is doin his thang Galveston ballaz on tha rize. you might see more of them in about 20
1,"PS/2 to serial? No, just wiring","Don't expect this device to work for all types of mice. After you've got one, as you may find soon if your mouse does not come with a PS/2-Serial switch, then this device means money wasted. No internal hardware, except some wires connecting the 6pin Mini DIN connector to the 9 pin serial connector is all this adapter does. If your mouse hardware interface goes out PS/2 only, then this device is not what you need!"
3,"Works, but not with all systems and software","This hardware item works fine.It does not work with all computers, and not with all software. No fault of the item though.Clay"
1,Didn't exactly work for me,"I had some trouble getting this to work. After some experimentation, I found out that the mouse had no power supply; therefore the computer would not recognize the mouse. This is normal...A serial port has no designated power supply pin. I thought I saw something on the label that said that only mice equipped to handle this type of device should be used. In other words, consult your mouse documentation (if you have any) first to make sure it is compatible."
5,Does What's Suppose To,Perfect if you have an older type keyboard plug and need to use a PS-2 type keyboard with it.
1,Bad quality of this product,"The marker color is blue, but actual color is green and it is hard to erase what is written on a white board. Also it has strange smell when you use it. Such kind of bad product should not be allowed to sell on Amazon."
1,Not enough tweaking can get this drive to work,"I received this drive thinking I could burn information on one side and have a professional label on the other side. No instructions (except on the disk) were included for installing this drive. While the computer did recognize the drive and ""Read"" the disk, it would not write data nor did it even recognize the Light Scribe function. After going to the Samsung site for a ""Firmware"" update and spending hours trying to find the update for this model, it said this model doesn't exist or some such nonsense. When I rebooted the computer, the drive wasn't even recognized although power was on and the drive door opened and closed. I tried it on 3 different computers by 3 different users. After the first computer, the drive was not recognized by either of the last two. Samsung customer support is non existent via phone or e mails. I have requested an RMA from the vendor through Amazon and we'll see what transpires."
4,the book can help me in listening,I want to review it again and help me to increase aboutlistening in english easy.
1,Too Bare Bones of a Production,"I'd been doing beginner's yoga for about six months before I tried this video in my pregnancy. The instructor only instructs through a monotonous (not soothing) voice-over rather than talking to the camera every once in a while...or having any kind of inflection. The two women behind her in the video who are also doing the poses/stretches are pregnant so it is nice to see pregnant women doing the routine...but they don't seem to have great form so they are a little distracting. Overall the video is produced in a way that makes it monotonous, detached and just strange. It's the type of thing I would be embarrassed to be seen doing...and my other yoga videos aren't like that."
2,Okay if you want a good stretch...,"I took a chance on purchasing this pre-natal yogo DVD in hopes that it would provide a decent, low-impact workout. I've done beginner's yoga for a few years and find it to be quite challenging, so I was hopeful about this workout. Well, to be frank, it's quite boring. Granted, there are a lot of great yoga positions that are not available to a pregnant woman, but this workout provided me with little more than a long, drawn-out, deep stretch. So, if a great stretch is what you're looking for, than this is for you! Otherwise, keep looking, and let me know what you find, please!"
2,Too fast and a little confusing,"I have bad hips and back and was looking forward to the 3rd trimester momma doing the modifications so I could keep up. She stops doing the modifications after the first session and so I couldn't go any farther. The hip exercises were way too hard and as soon as I got my leg into the correct position they moved onto quick rest and the next position before I could catch up. Also the dvd was mirror image so it looked like the ladies were using their right arms but the voice over said left, if I wasn't listening closely I got very confused."
4,Relaxing,"I am in my first trimester and I did prenatal yoga at a center throughout my previous pregnancy.This video is easy to follow, with clear all-English instruction and modifications demonstrated. The instructor's voice is calm and soothing without being syrupy or new agey.I didn't find it that challenging or interesting, however. I will probably need to mix it up with other videos throughout my pregnancy to stay interested in my practice."
4,Good bike rack!,"I have yet to use two bikes on the rack but for my one bike, this rack is great! It holds my bike securely and fits well on my car. I would recommend this rack to anyone looking for a simple way to travel with your bike."
1,do not buy,rubber bike hold snapped apart on my first try to install - I tightened the velco and the piece snapped apart !!!
4,Bike Rack,"This bike rack easily holds two bikes. It is really easy to use. I have an SUV and it hooks up in seconds. The only slight nuisance is that when you fasten the straps, since they pass through a rubberized hook, it catches a bit. Minor inconvenience for a great product."
3,Not the best but ok.,I bought this bike rack at wal-mart for $39.99. It's ok for short trips but the longer I drive the more loose the straps become. I have to re-tighten them every stop. Also don't know if it's because of my car but the bikes sit really low. I'm afraid of damaging my bike when I come to dips in the road.
4,Great for the money--just needs a couple of easy tweaks,"This is my first bike carrier, so I didn't have an overview of how to put one together--thus the instructions were a little disorienting at first. Once I got the hang of it, the assembly and installation went okay.There are three detractors to this carrier: (1) It is a gravity carrier, so your bike(s) will swing free unless you can bungee them somehow; (2) The hold-downs slipped around some while I was driving; (3) There are no pads on the hooks.Here are a couple of pointers to help you out when using this carrier: (1) Cut pads for the trunk hooks. I cut some 2""x3"" rectangles from an old rubber mousepad; (2) Buy a piece of foam pipe insulation from a home store. Cut two pieces roughly 8"" and place them on the carrier arms between the hold-downs. This will keep the hold-downs from sliding around."
2,"Good for one bike, not for two.","It's easy to install, and compact. But, its too small for two bikes. Also, the bar holders and velcro strips don't fit small frame bikes. For two bikes, this rack is to small. The bike support bars are to short for two bikes. If the bars were 10 inches longer, it would be fine. I have to much invested in my bikes to let them bang together on the road, and also into my car as well. It works great for one bike, but not for two."
4,good bang for your buck,"I've got a 98 Civic that's missing quite a bit of the paint, so I'm not particularly worried about the miniscule damage this does to my paint job. The most noticable is where the bike bangs into the bumper because it kind of swings freely off the bar. To combat I've tied the wheels and frame to the bottom part of the bike rack to cut down on the movement.If I had a car with an in-tact paint job I would think twice about attatching this to my pretty new car. I would probably opt for a more expensive alternative to preseve the looks of the car.But for the price you really can't ask for a whole lot more. It gets the job done, and it's very secure."
3,not for spoiler on corolla s,"i have an 05 corrolla s with a soiler, i bought from wallm on clearance, it did not fit."
5,Meets our needs. Great service.,I got this rack used for free. It was missing the cradles. I called Bell to order the cradles and instructions and they sent me everything free of charge even though I was not a customer. Didn't charge me for shipping either. We have used it for 2 mountain bikes with no problems.
1,Bad Design,"Someone gave me this rack. It did not fit their SUV and they figured I could use it for my road bike, a vintage Cinelli. I strapped it to my Toyota Camry and put my bike on it. Not only did the straps immediately loosen, but the bike flopped around on the rack with the pedals crashing into the trunk. The plastic strap piece that is supposed to secure the top tube of the bike to the rack easily comes loose. The overall design of the rack is very poor. I realize this is a very economically priced bike rack, but it is not worth the risk of having your bike fly off on the highway. I'd suggest going to a good bike shop and buying their entry level Yakima or Thule rack. For a few more bucks it would be well worth it."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is indeed a nice cheap rack, and as another reviewer said, I've never had any of my bikes fall off of it. However, don't expect it to last more than one riding season; I bought it in about mid-June, and by September, one of the velcro straps had torn clean through the cheap rubber mount holding it. Another one tore away early this year, and I had to move one of the mounts from one side to the other and turn it into a single-bike rack. Early this summer I finally gave up and bought a Yakima King Joe 3-bike rack, which feels much sturdier and also will hold the bikes in place vertically, keeping them from bouncing off of your bumper."
2,Still haven't figured this one out!,"I spent 30 minutes in the parking lot trying to figure out how to get this rack just right; It never happened...The directions tell you to push in the red buttons and adjust the rack. The problem is that there is no locking mechanism to keep the rack upright. I wound up scratching up my trunk while the bikes dangled there. The design doesn't make sense. By the way I work as a mechanical engineer, and this one puzzled me as to what I was doing wrong. I would buy a different one with a more secure design."
2,Disposable Rack,I bought this rack 2 years ago and it is pretty much dead and I'm just a casual rider.Pros:cheapCons:won't last longbike moves a lot when riding on interstatenot suitable for long distance tripsflimsy loop to hold bike in placebike holder loops break easilyrack will rust if you leave it on during raincan't really get 2 bikes on securelyyour trunk will get scratched and dinged up
1,Not worth it,"After dropping almost $50 for the rack, the first time I tried to mount my bike on it the rubber rings which hold the velcro loops in place simply broke when I tried to tighten it. The velcro loops themselves were too long and only about an inch of the available 3 inches of velcro could be used after tightening. Additionally, even though the mounting straps were secure when I started my 20 mile trip to my new house, they came loose after 5 miles and the bike itself began to jump after everytime I hit a bump. I couldn't go over 50 mph or the lower half of the bike would catch some wind and hit the back of the rack further loosening it. Some may say that you get what you pay for, but I surely think that even a cheap item should be able to perform the first time you pull it out of the box. A couple rods with pads on them and some bungees would be a better investment. Not worth it."
1,"what a ""PIECE"" of *&^$#","I ordered this item from amazon for a trip i was planning but it did not come in time before i was leaving, i was able to get the same exact one through Walmart on time same price. i was using this for a 550 mile trip to San Diego and back so it was 1100 miles round trip. every 150 miles i kept having to pull over because the tie downs would come lose and from the very get go I HAD tied knots in the tie downs so they would flap around and loosen but they still did. By the time i got to San diego the driver side support bar was showing signs of bending, but it made it to san diego and at that time thats all i was worried about. On the way back from the San Diego trip about 200 miles from home both support bars bent in , and the big round plastic elbows you see on each side of this thing,were laying on my hood and took out a ""dime"" size chip of paint out of my new 2010, 4 month old VW Jetta. i put towels under the plastic and made it home barely. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK."
4,Average Bicycle Rack,"After reading other reviews on this product, I was pretty skeptical to make the purchase. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the rack's performance. It takes less than 5 minutes to put on and take off once you figure out how to initially get everything strapped into place. It is kind of difficult to strap down two bikes (especially with aerobars) but you can adjust the ""holders"" to help a little bit."
4,Good deal for the price,"We used this bike rack for a four hour trip then back, and the only issue was some wobbling right after we got on the highway. We fixed that by tightening some bungee cords and it was good to go - no more problems all the way on highways. I trust Bell products and the price was affordable."
2,Would have been Nice to know ...,"That this rack might not work on a car with a rear spoiler. I'm going out to try again today, but when I tried yesterday frustration was the name of the game. I will update this review if I have different results."
1,Bike doesn't fit on rack,"It's a nice rack, easy to install, and fits securely, but if you have a 49 cm or smaller road bike the support arms too wide to support the bike by the top tube. One arm will fit on the top tube and the other is wide enough for the seat stay. I am not willing to put a Roubaix on it if it doesn't fit properly."
2,NOT for daily use!,"I was happy with this bike rack for about a week or daily usage. I drive to a parking lot, pull my bike off the rack, and ride the bus closer to work every day.This rack is fine for using occasionally, every week or so, but daily use wears it down quickly, and the comprises made for lower cost are no longer worth it.Many people complain about the rubber bike holders sliding down the rail, letting the bike hit the car. This gets worse and worse with time. At this point, the holders slide freely up and down the rail, making it difficult to get the bike on them quickly.The velcro straps make taking the bike off and on the rack slow. Having to stick the velcro through the hole and pull it back around may not seem like much, but doing it often really makes you envious of the rubber strapped bike racks.It;s not a terrible product. But if you're using the rack daily, I'd suggest putting down a little more money to get something more durable."
4,Bell Bike Rack,"Received in timely manner..easy to hook up, works great for my needs for a good price."
2,Spoiler Alert,I have a 2002 Nissan Altima and this rack would not fit over the spoiler. The product desciption does not mention there may be a fit problem on cars with spoilers. Buyer beware!
5,Bell Double Back Two-Bike Trunk Rack,This rack fits my vehicle perfectly - 2005 Ford Escape. The bike sits perfectly level and I never worry about it once I'm on the road.
2,cheap...but low quality....,"Honestly, I should have waited a little and saved money to buy a better rack. This one will do the job but you will be looking at your rearview mirror all time 'cause I did not feel it was sturdy enough.Also, I felt it was about to break when I tried to load the second bike. I am not convinced I'd recommend it."
1,Why Can't I install It?,I have a 1987 Ford Crown Victoria and after two hours of trying to install this rack I am about ready to box it up and return it.The problem is that after I mount it and put any amount of pressure on the bicycle support arms they move downward before contacting the straps. This does not seem correct and I am not about to place a $500.00 bike on this carrier unless I can figure out what the problem is. If anyone has any suggestions e-mail me at flags6262@aol.comThanks
5,excellent!,This works great! It's easy to attach to the car and works like a charm. My wife and I used it up the canyon and it did great. We also used it on the freeway and had no problems. Great product at low cost.
3,"Product ok, shipping was bad",I received an opened box and I think pieces of the foam were missing. Very unsatisfied with this purchase.
2,overall poor design,"Pro: inexpensive, fits trunk as it claimed it would for my car.Cons: It lacks the ability to manually adjust the angle meaning that for my car the rack was add a ridiculously elevated angle (about 55 degrees).It lacks side straps and therefore had a significant side sway.It lacked a vertical strap to keep the bike from swaying and sometimes hitting the bumper of my car.Overall the design of this trunk bike rack is poor. If you're never planning on driving on the highway with it, then this bike rack could work fine for you. I ended up paying a little over double for a Saris bike rack and I PROMISE you, it is worth every last penny! Dish out the extra and protect both your car and your bike!"
3,Bell could do it better..,"Pros:1) Best price in the market.2) Metal construction is very good.3) the reflectors are a nice touch.Cons:1) Lacks side straps/clips. Only upper/lower straps are provided. Definitely good for local trip with in 10 to 25 miles. Don't think it's good for longer trips. I've used it once on a 80 miles trip. It held up fine. But I would prefer to have side straps to be confident to drive at higher speeds. I was little concerned and had to watch the bike and my speed.2) the straps loop through plastic buckles. Though the design is better with saw tooth, it could have been better if they were metal buckles.3) to hold the bike to the rack, Velcro straps are provided. For smaller diameter frame tubes the Velcro doesn't stick well. The thickness of the tube has to be really big to get the Velcro stick well. It could have been designed little better to accommodate different frame thickness either with a different kind of tightening system or buttons."
2,Not if you are serious about carrying your bike,"We used this for several years. One time, the location of the rack kept the tire so close to the exhaust that it melted a bike tire.The last time it left a decently unattractive dent on the back of the van. Because hauling bikes is something we do regularly, and sometimes on long distances of 8 hours or more, this rack was somewhere between barely sufficient to precarious to a downright pain.If you want to haul bikes, we are finding out that it is worth it to just spend the money once and deal with it.Overall, I have been pretty disgusted with the unenduring quality of Bell products despite the fact that they look like they will work fine when they are purchased.Our findings are leading us to get a hitch and bar to carry bikes."
2,Good rack for road bikes NOT for heavy mountain bikes.,"This is a decent rack for the price. I used the rack on my 98 Toyota Camry and the rack scratched my spoiler. To avoid your paint from getting scratched, use two pieces of cardboard or some old rags and place them underneath both sides of the rack where it contacts your trunk. Would recommend only use for road bikes as they are lighter than mountain bikes. Drive careful on the freeway."
1,Too small,I should've heeded the previous reviewer's advice. The tights I got (although not as poor quality as she said) were way too small. She is 10 and I got 7-10 and the crotch came up to her knees. Order a size too big if you order these. These were the only lavender tights I could find. Of course I threw away the packaging before she tried them on so now I will have to find a tiny girl to give them to.
5,no headline,"arrived on time and fit great. no snags, no runs. my little princess looked great as a waltzing flower in her school's performance of The Nutcracker. The tights were just the right color to go with her flower tutu."
4,Costume,These tights worked great for my 18 month old babys Peter Pan costume. Added them under his pants and really looked cute.
2,DVD does not work in DVD players!!!,"Unfortunately, the DVD that is part of the yoga ball/band kit does not work. I believe it is defective in that the middle part (where the hole is to fit onto the DVD player) is too small and therefore the DVD must be forced in. I have tried it on three DVD players and could not get it to work on any of them. I also tried other DVDs, just to be sure it wasn't the players."
5,WOW... a value plus extreme proformance!!,"Okay, I know the name brand isn't well known in the industry but here is some high quality stuff. The sub can handle up to 750 watts. This package is one of the best. I went to Circuit city to get a sub plus an amp installed. Then I found out that needed the wires and the power supply and a whole mess of other stuff. They wanted 350 for an 8"" sub with a wimpy built in amp and that's w/o installation. Total waste. I went on Amazon and got this package and had it professional installed for only 180!! I saved so much money. This is a bargain and is the best deal you can get. You will love it. It would give you great joy."
2,Disappointed in the quality,"I know this is low end Rockford Fosgate but come on. Where's the quality? My issue is with this item is that I found out after I installed the amp that it was blown. Luckily Walmart carries these amps and was able to replace it. Other wise I would have had to de-install everything and return it all back to Amazon which would have been a pain and waist of time. So be cautious when you purchase this item, it may be better to spend a little more money and buy a kit like this right from Circuit City or Best Buy."
5,Great Book!,"Empire of Light : A History of Discovery in Science and Art, is very understandable but at the same time deeply informative and interesting. Extremely well researched and packed with loads of info. I learned something new on every page."
5,Perfect Pick,I use this pick when I play music at my church with my Taylor 410E. It's strong enough to get a good loud rhythm going and light enough to allow me to back it off and play mellow.
5,"Best picks on Earth. Flexible, indestructable","I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career. I rock hard. Acoustic, electric, and Bass! I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily. Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career. Buy these picks."
4,Pick me!,"Yup, its a standard pick. Works exactly like a pick... and I like my picks on the lighter side. Always afraid of breaking a string."
3,Been trying out these pick.,Got a set of these picks in today and have been playing around with them. They seem a little too flexible for my taste. They're inexpensive though so I think I'm going to try a thicker version and see how that suits me. Haven't played with them enough to see how long it takes them to wear but from other reviews I'm guessing they'll last me a very long time.
2,Book fell apart!,The story by Beverly Cleary is wonderful. I purchased 7 copies for myself and 6 other second grade teachers to read aloud to their classes. Each book fell apart as we turned the pages...the pages fell out! We had to hold the book together as we read!
3,Socks,"Socks is about a cat that is adopted my a young couple. They love him and adore him, but when the couple gets pregnant, Socks loses attention. When Nanna comes for a visit, she does everything she can to get Socks out of the house and away from the baby. After Nanna leaves, eventually, Socks feels loved again, and as the baby gets older, Socks finds a friend in him.Socks the cat is a gray tabby cat with a white belly and white feet that look like socks. That happens to be why his name is Socks. He has some darker gray stripes. He can be very mischevious at times, but all and all, he is a very lovable cat.This book was okay, I liked it a little bit. It didn't seem like it had much of a plot and it wasn't very easy to get into. I might ecomend this book to friend, it just depended on what the friend was into, or liked. This book is good for someone who really likes animals like kittens and puppies, but for anyone else I don't recomend this book."
1,bad,"I bought this book for my grandaughter, and was extremely disappointed with the condition of the book. Stains everywhere and smelled terribly. Not sure if I want to give it to her. First disappointment. May not use this distributer again."
3,Reflects the times,"This charming book tells the story of a new baby in the family from a cat's point of view. I remembered it fondly from my own childhood, and thought it would be helpful to read to my oldest daughter from a sibling-rivalry perspective.Sadly, the book is a reflection of the times in which it was written, and the baby in it is exclusively formula-fed. Why Cleary got so much flak for mentioning spaying pets to prevent overpopulation, and none at all in this day and age for setting formula feeding on par with human milk, and presenting that to her young target audience as a harmless choice, I'll never understand."
4,Socks By Bevely Cleary,"Socks is a cat who has a great family but than his family has a baby . So its all about how the cat acts and playes with the baby.Socks gets jealous of the new baby,but at the end you see how Socks acts with the baby as they get older.I thought this was one of Bevely Cleary's best books.This book is great for middle-school aged kids.This book made me laugh a lot and it inspired me to read more Bevely Cleary books."
5,Socks is great!,I read Socks three times when I was in third grade. I still think of it as one of my favorite childhood books.
2,Fly trap odor refill,I have had very little luck with any of my fly traps. They always show bottles just full of bodies. I have bottles with 20 or 30 flies. I will say that this Refill has been no less effective than any of the others I've used but since I've had no luck with any of them... that isn't saying much.
2,A Slight Improvement Over Vol. 3,Although an improvement over Vol.3 and with a new DJ this 4th edition in the Fire Island Classics CD's falls far short of the original Fire Island Classics and does not even compare to Vol. 2 which at least had classics on Disc 1. I wonder why the people over at Centaur still use the word classics in Vol. 3 & 4. Although this CD contains songs from the mid 90's an improvement from Vol. 3 which was produced in I think 2001 and featured music from that year it still does not capture the music most people thimk of when hearing the word classics in a CD title. To me this means late 70's to early 80's music.
1,Easily broken,Bought this chopper to cook small meals for two. It broke after less than 20 uses. This was the third model that failed in less than a year.
5,baby food on the go!,"This product surpassed my expectations. I was hoping for a manual chopper that I could use to feed my daughter out and about, and this was nearly perfect. It tucks into a tiny little package and separates at the top of the clear portion as well as at the bottom, so you can actually chop in the little cup and then serve right out of it! The only thing I wish I could have changed was that when using it this way, the bottom of the cup is only attached like a rubber stopper and it occasionally let go especially after adding enough water to make the right consistency food. But I would consider this a diaper bag essential for any child starting solid foods."
3,Its ok,"Used for chopping onions:You need to precut an onion and put one third at a time. With big peaces it gets stuck and you need force to get up right again and then you need force to push it till the end. When it get stuck its very frustrating. But once get passed first 3-4 pushes it start chopping onions nicely.Cleaning wasn't a problem for me, I like that I can disassemble it entirely and wash properly."
4,"Great, works very well","I've been using my mini chopper for more than a year, and it still works very well!I am not sure what's this mini chopper really intended for, but I only use it for chopping my garlic. I do cooking all day, and I use garlic all the time, so my friends recommanded me this chopper, and it really saves me a lot of time and work. Indeed, I like so much that I even got one for my mom, and she loves it!I've also used it to chop other small stuff like nuts and herbs, and they work as well. I think this chopper is good for chopping small stuff, so you don't need to use your big food precessor all the time."
3,Tough to clean,"I thought this would be the perfect device for chopping up walnuts, which I like to add to oatmeal for breakfast. It does chop them up reasonably finely, but many of them get stuck in the blades, from which they're surprisingly difficult to extricate. It's also too small to handle more than 2-3 walnuts at a time; the full-sized chopper would at least be more efficient. I don't know if a perfect chopper exists, but this certainly isn't it."
1,What was OXO thinking of??,"This thing is completely useless. Its too small. Nothing fits in the small chamber, well perhaps a few peanuts or maybe two cashews. It doesnt chop it mashes and as other reviewers mentioned, it is extremely difficult to clean. Maybe the regular size chopper is better, but stay away from this mini chopper!!"
4,Plastic spoon is not dishwasher safe,"This is a neat and handy product. But if you do buy it, make sure to wash the plastic spoon that comes with it by hand rather than by dishwasher. The very first time I ran it through my dishwasher, it flipped out of the cutlery basket, ended up on the bottom of the dishwasher, and melted. The good news is that Oxo will send you a replacement spoon if you contact them."
1,too small,"This chopper was so small I could only get about 4 nuts in it to chop, so I returned it and got a refund. I thought it was suppposed to hold a half cup but it did not."
1,Weak Plastic,"I bought this at Target. After I used it the 2nd time chopping green peppers, it broke! The tabs inside were sheared off and would no longer stay aligned. It's made of cheap plastic and is very weak. I threw it out and will buy some other brand."
3,"Works well, but too small","This chopper is smaller than I anticipated, and is really only useful for chopping herbs or other small items (scallions, for instance). It cannot be easily used to chop any vegetable, even precut onions, because it cannot handle the volume."
3,Handy in the kitchen,I would recommend this product. the only problem I found with this was that it is little small for cutting different things with it but just the garlic. Otherwise it is really handy
2,Small!!,"I used the slapchop for a while and was happy with that. When mine finally broke, I went looking for a replacement. This product is very small and gets stuck chopping simple things, like onions, so I have to pull the handle up for the first few ""chops"" to get the item chopped up. I do like, however, the measuring container that keeps everything and the little scooping spoon. All in all it's a decent product, but I guess I didn't expect it to be so small."
2,Smaller than the one shown in the pictures,"I have the 1 cup version of the OXO Good Grips chopper, and I really love it. I wanted another one just like it for my mom, but I wasn't sure if I owned the regular or mini chopper. The one shown in the picture for the ""mini"" holds 1 cup, so I ordered this one. Unfortunately, the mini chipper holds only 5 tbsp. I'm sure it's a great product, just like the larger one, but the pictures do not reflect the actual item."
2,chopper,"The chopper works well, but the circumference is really small. It works well with herbs and a few nuts. However, an onion has to be cut into 8 pieces to fit."
1,A piece of junk,"I believe this is the first negative review I've posted, but I simply must. This product is essential useless unless you notice the keyword ""garlic"" in the product write-up. What that means is: If the thing you want to dice is as small as a clove of garlic, you should be able to do that. Anything else you have to cut into bite-sized pieces and then put them in, chunk by chunk, and maybe the chopper will slice through them. I've tried onions and eggplants -- both relatively soft vegetables. From the first push down the chopper sticks and I literally have to yank it back so that the blades come out (not always successfully) of the chunk of vegetable. It doesn't matter what I put in. I thought this would be an eco-friendly food processor for small items in a small kitchen. Forget it. It's faster to grab a sharp knife and a cutting board and just get to it. Do not waste your money."
1,toy chopper,"Perhaps if the dolls in the doll house need a chopper. What a joke! The thing was a mini - I mean mini, about the size of a computer mouse!"
2,Not worth the effort,"While the chopper does chop, the effort required to keep vegetables or whatever you're chopping inside the container, plus the need to push the plunger far more than you could imagine, makes a nice, sharp knife a much better solution.Save yourself the money and cut down on the clutter, chop with a knife. :)"
5,The Live Sound and Recording Bible,"There aren't many things that recording engineers agree on. Sure we all like Neumann microphones, Neve Mic Pre's, and Studer 2 inch machines, but when it comes to things that the average studio can afford, there is much dissention.That is not the case with this book. Without fail, every single audio engineer I've met learned SOMETHING from reading the Sound Reinforcement handbook. Collected in these pages is the wisdom of a generation of Audio Engineers, and given that our field is one that is so much based on oral tradition, a book like this is invaluable for someone who doesn't have the time or inclination to learn things in the traditional way by hanging around in recording studios working for free.If you want to do anything in audio technology it would behoove you to learn this book backwards and forwards, because it contains between it's covers one of the most thorough and balanced presentations ever written on the topic. A great book."
3,KINDLE: NO TABLE OF CONTENTS! ...again.,"I really enjoy the versatility of the Kindle however, this is the second textbook I've purchased with no table of contents. The price is nice. The instant satisfaction of having the item you've ordered is nice but when instructors assign reading by page numbers and there are no page numbers in the Kindle version of the book IT'S A PAIN! Suggestion for students: download the free pdf version instead."
4,good for beginner,"this book is very good for beginners and people who do live sound, but it is not detail enough for people who do recording"
5,The Gold Standard for Sound Reinforcement,"If you are doing any sort of sound reinforcement, this is THE book to own. Great reference, great theory, great all around."
3,Not a design referance,"This book explained studio sound,the use studio equipment, microphone placement for studio and concert halls at the user level. ""Sound Engineer"" is refered to as the person mixing the sound in the studio, not an electrical engineer designing the equipment used. It did not go detailed enough in explaining elctrical performance,signal to noise considerations, amplifer stage gain, or distortion as it applies to the equipment."
3,Sound Reinforcement,Good general text. Did not cover enough aspects of live performance and sound shaping and enhancement for my needs. A little dated.
5,Bible of Sound,This book really good. I've almost read the whole thing. There is alot of good information and conceptual stuff like the science behind sound. There is also alot of application in the book except that the application part is relatively general about sound technique and equipment usage but nontheless very much helpful. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get serious or learn more about sound reinforcement as well as for people who have been in the business for years. This book has something for everyone.
5,#1 in live sound,This book is #1 in live sound. It takes you from A to Z. Although it requires a little understanding in algebra and electrical circuits but if you want to master the subject it will not be an issue. It is a learning material and a very strong reference that will not let you down ever.If you have the money to buy one book: Buy It Now!
4,Great but a little deep for me....,I bought this and Live Sound Reinforcement on the same day. This book is well done but a lot of it went over my head. Reading Live Sound Reinforcement first made it easier to understand some of the material in this book.
4,Recently Purchased,I purchased the book since I am working with a HOA sound/lite system. I have been using the book as a reference and have found it to be quite helpful at this point--I have only had it a short time. I will be looking forward to using it in the future.The Sound Reinforcement Handbook
4,HE CAN PLAY !,Richard is a fine musician and as one might expect from a CD every cut is not a winner. but his style is refreshing and you hear the influence of great avant garde musician but he is still so straight ahead. Buy it you will like it !
5,Solid cable should last a lifetime,Some Belkin branded products are overpriced imho but this Cable in particular is a steal.Hard to find in stores and if you do find it expect to pay 2-3 times the price.
1,sucker,"this movie suffers from an extremly bad director, it is poorly casted and the story as predictable as the eclipse of the sun.the only thing which kept me awake was the always reliable joan severance, struggling hard against the ""below average"" in almost every part of this flick.unless you really go for joanie, save your money and your time."
4,about the movie hard evidence......,Kira Reed in this movie is acting as a sex FBI/police officer and there are some sex scenes inside(to those whom are interested in this genre of erotic natural arts). The story is about Kira solving a FBI/police case.(I do not want to elaborate further to spoil the whole interest in the movie). This movie is longer in production BUT happen to saw it at the british web store called Bensonsworld.co.uk. This movie is worth for those whom like to collect. A good recommended collection for this movie.
1,I'm sure it would run great if it actually ran,"I bought one. It died over the space of a few days. I replaced it w/ another. It wouldn't even turn on. HP tech support cannot deal w/ a hardware problem (the machine could be spitting flames out the air vents and they'd tell you to reinstall XP).Their checklist for every problem says reinstall first. The first thing you do for that is reformat the hard drive. That's 3 hours w/ this sytem. You have to hang up and call back when it's done. This gives you a new tech support person, who talks you thru the reinstall from that point. If you're having a hardware problem, the reinstall probably fails. They look up your new problem. The checklist says to reinstall. The first step is to reformat the hard drive, so call them back in 3 hours. Rince and repeat.I replaced it w/ another brand that is working fine. HP sucks. One star is generous, but it's the lowest I could go."
4,"Very cute, practical","The pacified pod isn's ""essential"", but it's definitely good to have. You can keep the pacifier clean and easier to find in the diaper bag or in mom's bag, or you can simply hook this on the stroller if you are just going for a walk. And with all the cute patterns, you can definitely find one that suits your taste and matches your stroller or diaper bag!If you like to keep it low-maintenance, this can be particularly useful. If we are out doing errands, often I'll only take a carrier instead of the stroller, and because of the velcro on one end of the pacifier pod ""handle"" I can easily hook into the toy ring of my baby carrier or one of the belt hoops on my jeans. That way when the baby falls asleep and spits out the paci I can pop it in the pod and make sure it stays clean and is easy to find when I need it again. Recommended."
5,great little gadget,"Love this little pouch! Very handy because it will attch to anything; belt loops, purse, diaper bag, etc. Covenient place for binky and you always know where it is!"
3,It seemed like a good idea at the time,"I don't find myself using it as much as I thought I would. It's cute, and useful, but a bit pricey for how little I've found myself using it. I guess that's not really the product's fault, but that still makes me consider it just average."
4,Good seat but one one star taken away for shipping,"I orded a simular seat for myself earlier and was impressed that I then ordered this seat as a christmas gift. It looks to be good quality and comfortable and is exactly as described. The light flash bright enough to get anyone's attention approaching from behind. Can't wait to try it out in the spring.However, I paid for one day shipping and recieved the item three days later... that was a let down and a waste of money"
4,good product i'll it buy again,This bicycle seat is comfortable provides enough cushion for your hinny. The light on the back seat is bright and can be seen. I purchased it in Iraq; the only problem is they would not ship it overseas. So I had to have a friend sent it to me. Another down fall to this seat is you have to store it inside because the spandex outer lining does not stand up to the elements.
5,Great,"Item is just as described, fit my oster blender perfectly (its a vintage blender so I was worried it might not). Thank you!"
1,Rusting after 1st use. Buyer BEWARE!,"Buyer beware!! There is rust on the blade (around the bolt) after one use. This part is not stainless steel, so it will be useless in short order. I question the integrity of the seller after seeing this."
1,aka Oster,This is not an Oster blade ....it is a cheap Mexican knock off. The edge of the base is as sharp as the blades. One of the top blades was bent out of shape.Deceptive advertising that Amazon will never do anything about.
1,I agree with Deplorable,"I too will be throwing mine away. The metal base arrived bent, it is extremely thin and flimsy. Blades are also bent compared to original. Maybe it was just damaged in transit due to how it was sent, in a plastic bubble wrap mailer envelope with no protection. The sharp ends broke through and stabbed my mail person. Definitely a low grade replacement."
1,Blade cutter leaks in its center,"I bought the blade to replace my old one, which after years of use had begun to leak around its center (the bushing). The new 4961 blade leaks even more than my old worn one. Note: The enclosed gasket works just fine and keeps liquid inside, but the blade unit is faulty.I have requested to return this to the seller, Culinary Parts, fulfilled by Appliance Sales/Gourmet Depot and am awaiting a response."
4,Like the original,"This item appears to be an exact duplicate of the blade that came with our Oster blender 35 years ago. It is as sharp as the original, which is not actually very sharp. I spent some time with a sharpener improving the cutters before using this blade. I'm not convinced that this made any difference."
2,leaking problem,Liquid leaks into the bearing and comes out as rust at the bottom. I can still use it but this will shorten its life. There should be a seal that will not allow liquid to get into the bearing.
5,blades work great,"The replacement blades made our blender work like new again. Our smoothes are really smooth again, and blending is so much faster than it was with the old, dull blades."
3,Not sure its brand new,"First...received this SUPER fast. However...it only came from a city 40 minutes away....Just not 100% certain its brand new. The blades themselves do look shiney and new (also have little bits of oil on them). The base part however, is somewhat oxidized and looks like new blades were put on it. I'm no expert, so this just may be because it has been warehoused for awhile. I don't know. The gasket looks rather old and dry too. Kind of has that look that old rubber bands get.I have not used the item yet and none of the above would prevent me from doing so...but I expected a ""new"" looking item. Which again...it may be, but it'd be nice to not wonder."
3,Note Oster's new ice blades are *asymmetrical*,"You can't tell from the product photos (I believe the photos show an older model of the blades), but at least one of the newer models has an asymmetrical top blade. That is, the two upper cutting blades are bent at different angles. I googled a bit, and apparently this is intentional: asymmetrical blades are better at chopping ice cubes or something. Anyway, when I got them, I thought the blades were damaged and contacted the seller to return them. Linda from CulinaryParts explained my mistake, and I went ahead and kept them.So now I've used them several times, and they seem fine. Smoothies aren't exactly silky smooth, but I guess they're good enough. Bought to replace my original Oster blades, which got gummed up and rusted to the point that they were overloading the blender motor...construction is a bit shoddy on all of these blades, and the bearings really ought to be better sealed against liquids."
4,Smoothies forever,"This replacement Ice Blade for my Classic Oster Beehive blender is exactly as advertised, powerful, efficient and reasonably quiet. I can now confidently produce consistently textured smoothies anytime I want."
3,not sure about this one see below,Under side does not have a brass fitting holding blade in place like one I am replacing.Top does not have a washer on top of blade and then a rivet.One I am replacing does have washer and rivet.Not sure if it is original Oster but I'm going with a Brass version I purchased from another seller.I'm not returning it because it not worth it. I'll put it away and if I ever put this 541F up on Ebay I'll include this extra blade.
5,Great performance one year later,"I purchased this blade 12-07 and it is still doing great now, 05-09. I needed a spare blade so I wouldn't have to disassemble my large blender pitcher for all the small jobs, and so I'd have a clean blade ready when needed. I grind coffee, ice, grains and baby foods primarily, and this blade performs wonderfully."
2,Rust!,This item does not seem to be an Oster brand replacement. I have only used a few times and there is already a lot of rust forming. The item works well but I will need to replace it soon due to the rusting.
1,Waste of money,"I bought this replacement because my original blade was leaking through the bearing. It took a few years for that to start, which moderate usage. This started leaking on the first use. Waste of money"
2,Some disappointment,"When I ordered this item, it was because my existing blade did not turn easily due to being so old. The new blade, though it will work, does not turn as freely as my existing blade did when it was new. The metal is different, though I don't know if that has anything to do with the turning blade, or if maybe it is also an old part....?"
3,Better than the original,"The blade that came with my Oster blender did not cut ice well. I'd blend, then stir, and blend and stir but the ice would not get crushed. This blade works much better and I can actually make smoothies! It has saved the blender that i was about to throw in the trash. Now that is not to say that this product is flawless, because it's not. I still have to mix it several times for all of the ice to chop up. This is still a big improvement over the original!"
4,Oster ice blade,"The price was right - $1.01. Of course, after shipping, it was over $6 but with the rubber ring included, it was still a good buy. It was about time to get a new blade and make smoothies more efficiently. Great way to use up some of the abundance of fruit that we have in Hawaii. Nutritious and delicious."
3,oster 4961 ice blade,the blade is not an original and is slightly smaller (blades) than the original and the center weld on top tends to rust with usage
2,This is what you get today.,"You can tell that this is made over seas. The blades had to be straightened as they were bent and the base leaks were the drive shaft spinns the balde. This is why I odered a replacement of the original. The main shaft that holds the blades is made of common steel, were the original MADE IN THE U.S.A. is made with 100% Stainless Steel. This is what you get today."
5,Enduring Classic,"I first read this book in 1955, and for fun, I read it again in 2005.It is reassuring to note that nothing has changed.Enid Blyton's Adventure Series should be the mainstay of every childhood reading program, and ""Island of Adventure"" is the place to begin."
4,DOOM!,"This is a slow, doom and gloom record. Not for all tastes though, mind you. If you're looking for speedy, thrashy death metal that sounds ear-splitting, look somewhere else. This is SLOW death metal. I'm actually surprised it's on here. It also features a member of Napalm Death on backing vocals of the song ""Acid Orgy"". Slow grinding guitars and echoing vocals make this, in my opinion, a solid release. The sound quality isn't the best, but consider the source. This was back when underground labels were REALLY underground."
1,Poor Packaging,"Anyone who knows anything about patch cables would understand that the way belkins patch cables are packaged add undue stress to the cable.... The cable is wound too tight to fit in the small packaging. StarTech.com, Panduit and Nordx are the only companies I have seen that properly package CAT5E cables.. So buyer beware..."
3,only wish it was 1000 mg.but great stuff,i love any kind of sheep placenta.i think it is good for my skin hair and nails.i wish it was 1000 milligrams but its good.i break open the capsules and wipe it on my face and then put my makeup right over the top of it.
5,gang box,"Thats what my coworkers nick named me because off all the tools I carry and the size of the rig. This is what I carry every day ,tape,knife, caulk box,small prybar, 2 pencils, sharpie,4 in one screwdriver, snips, dikes, speed square, combo square, nail set, all in their own holders.Depending on what I am doing I'll also carry, a second caulk box, 2 vise-grip c clamps, rock saw, rasp, and a 9 inch level, with every tool in its place. Very large and heavy but with the 5055 suspenders very comfortable. Great for framing and rocking but too large and bulky for trim and fine work. Thinking about buying the trimmers belt also. My old belts always tore, these show no signs and will last for a very long time. These belts are not for everybody because of the price, size, and weight. Try one on before you buy and make sure everything is adjusted, it took me a week to get the suspenders adjusted right, but have not changed them since."
5,great scale,"Was delighted to find this scale still on the market and just ordered another. Have used it to weigh food for my type 1 diabetic son for the past 12 yrs and prefer it over many of the more expensive digital scales we have. The stainless steel pan is easy to clean and can be put into the dishwasher. The scale, which measure in both grams and ounces, is accurate and the dial is very easy to read. It is also a nice size-can be stored easily on the counter or in a cabinet. The white plastic base isn't the most attractive, but it can be easily wiped off with a damp cloth. A great value for the money!"
5,Highly Recommended,"I have used this scale for about a month now and love it. It has oz & gm weights on dial. The silver container is dishwasher safe, easy to clean and use. You could also use your own small or medium size container and reset the dial to zero, as an option. My old scale is not as easy to use, does not measure gms and does not go over 1 pound.I keep it on the counter, not hidden in a cabinet, because I use it every meal and it looks nice. This make portion control much easier.Since my review in Jun 2011, I lost 20 lbs (I could have lost more but I got distracted for 4 months.) I am writing this update 6 March 2012.This scale made it much harder for me to cheat & lie to myself about my portion sizes. I used this and an iPhone app (MyNetDiary) to track my intake and it worked. Using the 2 made it as easy (or easier) than using Weight Watchers diet for me. My latest goal is to lose another 10 lbs in 90 days; baby steps to my final goal weight."
3,Interesting But Difficult Work,"Isaiah Berlin, in his work ""Karl Marx,"" concentrates on the philosophical development of one of the most influential social thinkers in modern history. Through an examination on Marx's critical analyses of the ideas of his intellectual contemporaries (including Feurbach, Fourier, Saint-Simon, and Proudhon), Berlin explores the many influences that helped shape Marxian thought. Although Marx's immediate successors minimized the impact of Hegel upon Marx's ideas, Berlin maintains that Hegel's influence was essential for the formation of Marx's socio-economic philosophy.I read this book for a college course and found it very challenging. Often I would have to read over passages several times to even begin to understand the gist of it (and maybe not even then). Of course, the subject matter is very complex. One just beginning to study Marx may want to seek out a more simplified overview of Marxian thought first before tackling this one."
5,Great Reading for Lent,"The way this book is set up, with the ""guest narrative"" in the front, and the ""Lessons"" in the back, makes this extremely easy reading. But that's not to say it's simple-reading, by any means. The perspectives it gives of the people involved in the Passion Story is very thought provoking. As a priest it has given me many new ideas for my preaching. For a lay person as well, ""And Then He Called My Name"" will open up new insights into the power of Jesus suffering, death and resurrection."
5,Difficult to put down,Very well written. Well researched and detailed in documenting the extraordinary events and works of this great saint. It's proof of the powers received by those who embrace and live the fullness of the faith and sacrifice continually for the love of God.
2,"Per 6 year old ""Just people talking""","I bought this because my 6 year old son watches animal documentaries all the time. He was not impressed since there was very little computer regeneration of the dinosaurs. The storyline is OK but not gripping. The 3D was strange also. Objects near the camera or TV looked elongated. If the person's shoe was the closest to the lens, they looked like they had clown shoes on. A jeep hood where the camara was obviously mounted on the right front of the jeep made the hood look so odd and long that there could have been a V12 motor in there. I think if they had actually shown a jeep with a 400hp V12 motor powering its way through the Arizona badlands, it would have been way more interesting!"
2,Another 3d mistake,"Pretty pictures of the GobiI dessert but not enough 3d effects and not enough Dino footage. I don't need to see palentologists loading their luggage in 3d. I had my choice between dinosaurs of the Patagonia and this one. Trust me, this wasn't the better choice. Sigh..."
2,LAME!,Very bad documentary.. I only bought this to try out my new 3D TV. Waste of my money. Save yours and dont buy. Time Warner cables has a free similar doc in 3D. found that out after I bought it.
2,No fue una buena compra (Not so good),"Lo compré pensando en mis niños, sin embargo es más bien un documental muy corto para adultos, con imágenes en 3D interesantes, pero nada muy acabado, mucho menos de los dinosaurios, muy poco detallado, la verdad fué una pérdida de dinero.Didn't Like it, too short, just about 30 minutes of movie (documental) for a few Dinosaurs, 3d effect it's Ok but.... waste of money, Do not buy it!"
2,"3D missing, no effects","This item should not be sold as a 3D, no 3D effect at all...And I have all the required equipment for 3D viewing...So don't buy if you are looking for 3D dinosaurs...You will regret your purchase."
2,Not what I was expecting,Very little dino footage. It is more about how they find the bones then anything else. Very limited seeing the dinosaurs. I didn't like it and probably never see it again.
1,So Disappointing,"After seeing some awesome 2D dinosaur shows on National Geographic and Discovery Channel, I thought this would be remotely similar. There were barely any dinosaurs in this dinosaur movie. It was a documentary about a bunch of paleontologists digging up some fossils. How lame. Part of the DVD was a big blank screen in the back with a small inset of a 2D video of paleontologists digging from 1920 in black and white. Why would I want to see this? If you're expecting animated dinosaurs, there's about 4 minutes of that in this 48min DVD. Skip it altogether. I realized after I purchased that you can rent it from amazon for $3.99. I wouldn't have even been happy with a rental let alone purchasing, but would have saved $16 at least. Will not take a chance and buy any more Imax 3D DVD's. If you have a 3D HDTV, you probably can download the rental first, don't buy with high expectations."
2,Stick with the Flinstones,"Another movie trying to ride the 3D wave but not succeeding. Bought this thinking I would see computerized dinosaur footage but instead watched over an hour of students digging in the dirt in the west. If Jurassic Park ever goes 3D, you'll see 100% more dinosaurs than this flop. Save your money!"
2,3d not very good,"Just got a 3d tv, player, glasses - not much difference between 3d or 2d - waste of money and time."
1,nothing,"I have not received the products, including the amount has been debited from my credit card, but have not received anything, does estraviou?"
1,movie is not real 3D,"I bought this 3D movie for my neighborhood's children . I though that this is funny 3D movie but not.This is just a documentary film and I could not watch all. Because really bad documentary film..But photo of the outer box is really real:)I do not advise to buy,"
2,Boring....,"This 3D movie is provided as a free HD 3D movie on Time Warner Cable in my area.Ocean life, astronomy, our planets, insects, animal life, dinosaurs - well, most areas of science, have interested me most of my life so I watched parts of Dinosaur's Alive! months before we even thought about purchasing a 3D TV. It was boring, but easy to watch w/o 3D as the screen is split horizontally with almost identical footage being viewed on either half. I thought the show might be more tolerable watching it in 3D - we recently purchased a Samsung UN46D6400. I was wrong. The narration is monotone, the 3D effects aren't all that spectacular, and the documentary itself is just plain boring. In my opinion, 3D couldn't even make this boring documentary any more interesting.I appreciate that Time Warner is providing it free & I am very, very, very glad I didn't purchase it."
2,Not Enough Dinosaurs,"I bought this only because I thought it would be cool to see alot of dinosaurs coming toward me in 3D. This film is more archaeology and not that many different types of dinosaurs. Plus the 3D wasn't great, as some of the images seemed distorted."
3,It's OK,"Good 3D effects, Movie is a little slow & boring at times. My main beef is this DVD kept stopping all the way through, haven't had that problem with any other disc. I played it on 3 other players and they all did the same."
1,This Dinosaur Needs to Remain Extinct!,"Pros: InexpensiveCons: Sit down and I'll tell youI've recently purchased active and passive 3D HDTVs. I got excited and bought a host of 3D Blu-Rays. This one is by far the worst! One can tell it was 2D and made 3D. Stuff is still looks 2D after the fact. It is very, very blurry. In 3D, there are supposed to be two images, slightly spaced apart. In some sequences they were spaced 6 inches to foot. It made the 3D video blurry and it hurt my eyes and gave me a headache! I know parents will buy it for their kids, but you'll be wasting your $$. It's my opinion they are just trying to make a quick buck with this one. I have a lot of faith in IMAX films, but not this one."
3,The 3D is good...,"The 3D is good, but the story is sort of boring. I also realized that if you Have Brighthouse Networks or Verizon Cable Box, you can watch this for free on demand."
2,Disappointing 3D,"Being the subject about dinos and all, i expected some great 3d action. so disappointed. It is still good from educational point of view.. but don't expect too much of it either. Overall not worth the price."
1,Waste of time and money,"I like documentaries but this one was just plain boring, what a waste of money. The commentary was boring and rather monotone. I bought the movie to watch with my grandkids, WOW dinosaurs, six of them started watching with me and within the first 5 minutes I was alone. After I struggled through the rest of the show I put on one of the underwater 3-D movies and my grandkids came back and we all watched it. The ocean movies aren't all that great, so that should tell you how boring this dinosaur movie is."
3,its ok,"There are some pop out scenes, but not as good quality of some of my other 3d movies. If you can get it cheap, get it. If not, don't bother."
2,Story is good,"3D format is adapted from IMAX. Watching the movie has been giving us terrible headaches. We own dozens of 3d movies, and this is the only one doing this. 3D format not properly adapted for TV viewing."
4,great movie,"that is a great movie about dinosars and recomend for all , I return to the jurasic with my child and enjoy this journey"
2,Poor 3D Quality,"This program is both 2D and 3D capable. Product comes with 4 pairs of paper 3D glasses of red/blue lens which is of horrible quality. Instructions state to use the 3D glasses that comes with your BD or TV if available, but my Samsung glasses does not recognize this BD media. With the included glasses on, the picture on the TV is in 3D, but there is a red glare on the screen. The CGI in this BD feature is of high quality, but should have been made for 2D. I love 3D programming, but would not recommend this."
2,Loud unnecessary music drowns out commentary!,There is no reason to have loud unnecessary music that drowns out the commentary!Dinosaurs didn't dance.
2,Not enough dinosaurs,The description of the video is deceiving. This is more a plain documentary about the archeological discovery of dinosaurs with very little actual 3D animation of dinosaurs. Kids will not enjoy this. This is really just a 2D documentary that happened to be shot in 3D.
3,"Shoud've been titled ""Looking for Fossils""","I love Reptiles,even have a few,interest started as a kid with Dino's.So ..I try and get all the Dino 3d's out there....here are the positives for this one....it's the only one i've seen that actually show the Dino's attacking other Dino's,its pretty good 3d,and no matter who you purchase this from..the price is right.Now let me explain why the price is right....the title is Dinosaurs Alive,yet most of the movie is about dead dinosaurs i.e people fossil hunting,traveling looking for fossils or explaning fossils.The stars of the show..the Dinosaurs,are few and to far between boring narratives.When the stars do appear,its interesting,and again,the price is right...I struggled on my review score between 2 and 3 and decided on 3 because I did enjoy the Dino's and the 3D,even though it could've been MUCH,MUCH better without all the fossil hunting."
2,3d Disappointment!,"Im glad I only rented this. It does give you the option of watching in 2d or 3d. The blu ray 2d option is as expected but the 3d is terrible for home viewing. It was so bad at one point they had to throw a shovel full of dirt at the camera being the highlight. Im amazed IMAX would even identify with this feeble attempt at 3d. But while Im at it if you get the chance to view it and want a good 3d experience at home watch ""Legends of flight"" It is a documentary with 5 star 3d effects."
2,Disappointing ...,"With so many incredible dinosaur dvd's like When Dinosaurs Roamed America and Walking With Dinosaurs, this dinosaur dvd just doesn't cut it. It is not exciting and is missing much key information. Maybe when it was in the IMAX and 3D it was amazing to view, but nothing special for home viewing."
1,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.There are about 16 out of screen effects that extend 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. Another 7, very brief dino tail whips reached 25%. The best few OOS effects were during the closing credits of dinosaurs' heads protruding through the words.EXCESS PARALLAX in about 65% of the scenes, (a disturbing amount). This IMAX film should have never been released to the public in this poor state, shame on them.*** AVOID UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE 3D GONE WRONG !!! ***MY 3D RATING = POOR (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
2,Be Aware!,I bought this after reading a few of the reviews and because there is very little 3d content available at the moment. I was hoping to have a few dinosaurs jump out at me but was sadly disappointed. I read the one review where the gentleman raved about how his little boy loved this and watched it over and over. I can now tell you that the little boy is going to be a genious and not a thrill seeker because there is nothing in this video that is thrilling. It is a documentary. 90% of video is in the deserts with research teams. Granted that a few of the desert shots with researchers in the foreground look pretty cool in 3d... it is hardly a show piece for your brand new 3d tv. I would recommend buying a cartoon type 3d video. Monster vs. Aliens is good. Even better is the Motorsport 3d game for Playstation 3.
3,"Just OK, good 3D",Some of the 3D was pretty good. Lots of depth and stuff pops right out of the screen.The CG could have been a bit better. The story was also a bit boring.Don't know if I would pay $20 for this. Might want to wait until it goes on sale.
4,A good look at the american psyche thru japanese eyes,"This is a great look at the Japanese mind that is actually turns out to have universal applicablility. After reading it I saw the western world in quite a different way, there are so many things that we can not see because we live in one culture. I did have a problem with the book though , which might be the author's or translator's fault, the constantly sexist language. The word man is used over and over again for both sexes which makes the book confusing at times. The author is also a died hard fruedian and so the book carries with it all the applicable baggage."
5,Look Mom - no greasy hands!,"Product was delivered on time and works as advertised.It works in place of messy lubricants, mostly grease, that gets all over the bed of your truck, clothes, accessories, etc........Simply slip it on the King pin of your 5th wheel and it's ready to use.There's a little white flaking from the material during normal wear but I'll take that over greasy messes anytime."
4,Nei Jia Quan,An inspiring and accessible internal martial arts text. This book provides a variety of perspectives from a number of highly respected and experienced instructors. Each interview clearly expresses each instructors unique perspective and insights. The format and clarity of writing ensures the book is both informative and enjoyable to read. A valuable resource to anyone interested in this field
5,An informative introduction and in-depth analysis of each of the martial arts practices of China,"Nei Jia Quan: International Martial Arts is collectively written by thirteen knowledgeable teachers of Tai Ji Quan, Xing Yi Quan, and Ba Gua Zhang and is ably edited by Jess O'Brien. Nei Jia Quan informs the reader of the many varying perspectives of the philosophy, history, training methods, and fighting technique that make each of these fighting styles unique and individually inspiring. As an informed and informative introduction and in-depth analysis of each of the martial arts practices of China, Nei Jia Quan is a very highly recommended read for all students of the martial arts, as well as those with an interest in Chinese history and general culture."
4,Food for thought.,"I just received this book and have really found it interesting. I really like that it features so many different folks. Some of them are famous some not but they all have something to offer and their differences help make the book accessible to more people.It isn't how to, but most how to martial arts books are useful only as an occasional reference piece. This books is more vital because it's more fun to read and because the various opinions presented challenged me to rethink what I've been taught or what I'd been thinking.Additionally the book is pretty entertaining which sadly cannot be said of all Martial Arts books.In summation it's much more T'ai Chi magazine than Inside Kung-Fu and that's a really, really good thing."
3,Barb's review of Knit Ponchos....,"Not a book I've picked up again since reading it once. I thought it was well done though, just not what I was really looking for."
4,Very nice book,"This book has a nice scarf pattern collection. I am not into making ponchos, so I did not use that portion of the book. Patterns are very easy to follow. I would definitely recommend this book."
5,Must own book for a knitter!,"This is my favorite knitting book I have every owned. Very specific instructions...mix with youtube videos and you'll be knitting in no time! The patterns are a good variety, and the fact that you're knitting scarves and such really helps you to master patterns. Good book."
3,disappointed but still the right price,"Hmm, if I had paid the price wanted at my local on-line book shop I would have been very unhappy, this book did not really live up to expectations, while it does contain instructions on how to turn scarves into ponchos,the ponchos are pretty basic, you can get the same type of instructions from the internet for free. Not to be too hard on it though, it does contain some interesting pictures and there is at least one project I would make, as I said, it was the right price."
3,Good but beware of incorrect cast on sts,"I love the projects in this book HOWEVER, BEWARE,there are a number of patterns that do not have the correct number of cast on stitches. For example on page 75 the white lace scarf says cast on 16 stitches but then the first row has 18 stitches. Similarly on page 79 the winter mountains scarf says cast on 36 stitches but there are at least 38 sts in the first row instructions or if you use the pattern diagram the first row includes 40 sts."
2,10 Patterns have ERRORS ask Publisher for Errata Pages,"I flipped through this book at the store and found several items I would like to make. I prefer written directions so I had a problem with my first project the bead-fringe scarf. Luckily the chart was correct. I read through the reviews and saw others were having problems so I contacted www.krausebooks.com and they did email me corrected or clarified instructions/charts for about 10 of the projects. Pro's: Most of the projects are simple and attractive with good photos. Neg's: The directions/charts are wrong. You have to contact the publisher and request corrections they don't have an ""errata page"" to access at their site. I understand the occassional error will be overlooked but 10 in one book???"
3,Very Basic Book. Good for Beginners.,"This is a good beginner book with simple patterns and basic photographs. It's not groundbreaking and I don't feel compelled to start anything in it, but I do like to look at it for inspiration. It has a short techniques section and simple sections on cables, lace, beading & edging. Most of the patterns are rated Beginner / Easy and 80% of the patterns are for scarves. This is a good book if you like to use fancy yarns."
5,Great shoes!,"These shoes are beautiful. I love them. I ordered my normal size, 9, and they fit very well. At first they seemed small, but stretched with time. They are not perfectly comfortable, but not bad either and are just so pretty so I can put up with a little discomfort."
2,Speed boat,"Lasted about 2 days! My 8 yr old loved it! But not durable....leaked water and battery wasn't stable, it would slide to one side and make it lean. Also it shorted out once water got inside."
1,really bad quality,this r/c boat got to my house not working at all. the battery seemed to be damaged and the bot seemed to have technical difficulties. Even though i followed all instructions put the boat in the water it did not run. this boat is not a boat that i recomend buying it's not even worse what it cost. its is worst than all the other r/c boats.
2,washed away,"The boat went dead after only 10 minutes after being fully charged. It got stuck in the middle of the pond. When retrieved, the antennae was missing."
1,It broke in 20 minutes,"We made sure we followed the instructions carefully. We made sure the cover over the battery pack/motors was as tight as it could be. We ran the boat for less than 20 minutes before it just died. I recharged the battery, tried the odd instructioon to create a circuit beteen the two drive shafts with my hand,and looked for loose wires etc; nothing works. Very expensive 20 minutes. While there was a little water in the boat after we used it and it died, it was only a couple tablespoons, that must have come in through the driveshaft holes in the hull. I think this design is horrible, and you should not expect this to last past the first use. It's junk."
4,"Fast, Fun, enjoyable for kids","My son (age 7) received it for a gift. He wants to play it all the time. It is very easy for him to control and has good range. Run time is limited to about 15 min. before batteries have to be recharged. Purchase an extra battery pack and your time will be double. Good price for a good product. Makre sure you have plenty of room to operate because the boat does have a pretty far range. This is a very fun, fast little boat. We just purchased 3 momnths ago so far so good."
1,Non-operational,Purchased two new speed boats and I couldn't get both to work. Very disappointing. Don't even know how to reach the company to inquire.
2,Disappointing,"I took this Boat out to the Conservatory Pond in Central Park and it turned out to be a lot of fun! However, I was incredibly disappointed by the fact that while I charged the batter the night before for 5 hours, I was only able to get the boat to run for 15 minutes!!! HUGE disappointment. So basically, I had a 30 minute bus ride to Central Park, walked about 10 more minutes to get to the Pond and was able to enjoy this item for 15 minutes!???Not an incredibly positive experience, generally speaking :("
3,Not bad but needs customer service,This boat came missing a piece - the antenna piping support. I have been trying to find a good way to contact the company but finding this more difficult that I would have liked. I think that it would be more helpful if there were a link directly to the company to facilitate this type of service.
1,The boat sank!,We put this boat on our pond yesterday. It immediatly began to take in water and it sank to the bottom. There is no way to retrieve it...not that we'd want to! Very disappointed little boy. Aren't these boats supposed to float?
1,"fast, fun, does not last","My son bought it to take up to the lake for a summer vacation. First time in the water, it was a blast. Went home charged battery to run a second time. Would not work after that. We read all trouble shooting instructions and tried everything we could to get it working. We returned it for a refund. Very cheap quality."
1,defective item,"unfortunality i got my boat and hurry up to charge it and try to use it,well it didnt work,the iten is defective and had a QC label,which mean it been opend or used before ,this is really bad,i dont recommend this item or actually the store"
2,Boat ran without control,"Received boat, boat would not work properly, on/off switch did not function and the remote did not function eitherBoat would turn and propellers would spin as soon as battery was plugged in.Very disappointed for my nephewThis was our second attempt on purcahsing an RC boat and none seem to work..."
5,"23"" Balaenoptera Musculus Radio Remote Control Racing Boat",Got this for nine year old grandson and he loves it. Works great. Would recommend backup rechargeable battery as battery lasts only about 15 minutes.
1,"Buying lousy, lousy toy","I bought the boat a few days ago, but did not work. Simply nothing happened. It is the second time that happens to me radio control toys.I'm disappointed in this type of toy. Living in Ecuador, is complicated forward.I would not recommend anyone buy this toy, it says on the box ""Made in China""."
5,GREAT for the price. Very fast. My Grandson loves it !!!!!,Very fast. I bought this for my Grandson for Christmas and he loves it !!!!!My son in law and his father both want to buy one !!!!!
1,Highly disappointd,Upon receipt the product failed to work at all. Immediately returned it for a refund. Had planned to give it to my grandchildren while they were here on vacation. Thanks for nothing.
1,The One I got DIDN'T WORK and neither did the REPLACEMENT,"I got this boat for my son for Xmas. It looks fantastic in the box. When we finally got to a lake to race it, it didn't work. Didn't do anything. Just sat there. I contacted the company and they wanted me to send the boat back at my expense. They also offered a replacement at $18 if I didn't want to send the boat back. I took that offer, since it was going to cost me $11 shipping anyway. That boat took way too long to arrive and it didn't work. It just sat there doing nothing. Now they want me to pay to send back both boats, before I'll get a refund. So, I get to pay $20 for nothing.Normally I like buying from Amazon, because shipping is not a hassle and the vendors are good. It is not the case this time. This product has tons of awful reviews. Unfortunately, all the good reviews were stacked at the top, and the bad reviews were further down, and one after another.I would not recommend anyone purchase this product."
4,"Great boat, just need a better battery","This is a great boat. My boys and I run it around the swimming pool and it's very fast and maneuverable. They slam it into the sides of the pool regularly and it withstands the beating just fine, at least so far. The boat does not go in reverse (at least mine doesn't), despite having a reverse button on the controller, which is a little odd. It's still plenty of fun though, going forward.My one big gripe is that the battery that comes with it is a 7.2v 1800mAh battery, which is underkill for the motors in the boat. The result is 5 hours of waiting for the batteries to charge for 20 minutes of playtime. That kind of charge to play ratio is a bit of a bummer. Do yourself a favor and buy a 4000+ mAh battery (or two) and a 'fast charger' if you buy the boat so that you can have some real fun with it."
3,Motor quit working,"Very fun boat. Very fast. However after about an hour of cumulative play time one of the motors quit working. (Not a battery charging issue.) Now the boat only goes around in circles because only one of the two motors works. My son is bummed out. I have not tried to fix it yet. Not sure if it's something wrong with the boat or something my son did. My son tends to take much better care of his toys than most kiddos, so I suspect it wasn't his fault. Probably just a loose wire somewhere, but still yet another thing to fix around the house."
4,5-yr old son loves this!,"My 5-yr old loves this boat! He and his dad have a lot of fun using it at a pretty big pond at one of our village parks. The only down-side is the actual amount of time it can be used on one charge (about 10-15 minutes). I think this was mentioned by another reviewer, so it was nice to at least know this ahead of time."
1,"It might have been fun, if it worked","I purchased this last fall as a group Christmas present for our grandsons. We live on a lake so I thought this would be ideal. Well, it might have been ideal if it worked. We turned everything on, put the boat into the water, and nothing happened. The light was red on the remote. No reponse from the boat when we used the remote. We got a sort of burned wire smell from the remote. The boat is totally useless. This was a waste of money. I guess you get what you pay for!!!"
1,did not work out of the box,i bought this rc boat off of amazon and first time in the water the boat would not steer right but would steer left and went forward. its a fast little boat but it is cheaply made. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.
3,Missing Parts,Don't know if the boat will work well or not. It was missing the pvc antenna holder for the boat. Have contacted RC by e-mail. Will see their response.
2,Not really worth it,I bought this item thinking it might be made with some quality since the description said it was originally $149. So you can imagine my disappointment when i open the box and the compartment cover doesn't even sit on the hull correctly. I'm not sure this item is worth the $40 I payed for it
1,would not buy it,"This boat is a piece of junk. After running it at the lake for about five minutes, it quit and that was it."
4,ustomer Support Needed,"Great boats, but the control module in one of 2 boats purchased failed after 30 minutes of operation. If Athena P Nguyen could send a new module I'd continue enjoying the boat and give a 5 start rating."
1,battery exploded after one charge,"Bought this for my son, who loves remote control toys. After leaving the battery to charge, it exploded. Not a safe toy for anyone. I returned."
2,Great idea! Awesome when it works. Poor Quality. 0 for 2,First one was awesome until it just stopped working correctly. Bought another one and it was defective right out of the box (Ran continuously when placed in water irregardless of the on/off switch) Returned. My son was very disappointed.
1,Don't waste your money,"I ordered this in August 2012 as a Christmas gift for my son. When we went to put it in the pool, as we turned the switch on, some metal piece fell inside the bottom of the boat and it would not work. I understand that sometimes products just don't work the way they should and it is by no means the fault of the seller. What I DO consider to be the fault of the seller, NST GIFTS, is that they would not replace the boat since it had been over 30 days. I explained to them that it was a Christmas present and it didn't make a difference. This is not the type of customer service I was expecting and definitely will not be ordering anything from them again."
4,Fast is an understatement!,"This boat is fast! I purchased it for my 9 year old son for Christmas and he loves it. The boat is extremely fast, with nice sharp turns, responds to the controller immediately. Highly recommend this RC boat. Durable too, as one time the propellers got caught in some plastic netting, we got it free and nothing was broken or damaged. Seller is excellent to deal with. Only negative on this boat: the battery. Battery loses charge each time you use it and it only gives you about 30 minutes play time before it runs low."
3,"bad hatch seals, turns well, fast 1-2 min and slows quickly. as fair as durability, i've had it out 2 times seems ok, will be r","bad hatch seals, turns well, fast 1-2 min and slows quickly. as fair as durability, i've had it out 2 times seems ok, will be resealing the hatch area, front and back"
1,Did not work...,"Followed all of the directions, charged the battery... Etc. Nothing I could do would make it work. It looks really cool and if it worked probably would have been a blast! I read some of the other reviews and agree that the soldering job in the remote is not that great, but this one did have the antenna wire hooked up in the remote. Going to have to return I guess...Good luck if you get one, hope yours works better than mine."
1,Went through 2 Boats In less than 10 minutes Running time!,"Bought the first boat for my sons Birthday put in water less than 10 minutes of running time the boat went crazy both props just got hung wide open would not respond with the remote what so ever, even turned the boat and the remote off and still just ran wide open!..Ok then payed the shipping to get another boat and within 30 seconds of use the boat did the exact same thing, both props were going wide open with no response from the remote, before I could get it turned off one of the motors burned up and I'm not spending any more money to get another one of these boats because I dont want another problem...I'm not going to waste anymore time or money for a product that does not work like it is suppose to, I do not recomend this boat to any person especially kids because they will not get to play with it, and will just be disapointed!!!!"
1,Missing pieces,"I purchased this toy boat after a friend of mine brought it to an outing. It's an extremely fun toy but when I received it in the mail, parts were missing and the battery never charged. I will be returning this product."
1,Died after 10 minutes,"I got this for my nephew. At the first use, which lasted about 5 minutes, he noticed that the remote control had completely consumed all of the new batteries he put into it. We got new batteries. The next time out, the remote lost control of the boat (not due to distance, but malfunction either in the boat or the remote) and the boat sped off out in the middle of a large lake.I can say that my nephew thought the boat was fast and made impressive turns ... while it lasted. But this thing is so cheaply made that I would not recommend buying it. It likely will not last more than 10 minutes. There is something very wrong with the design of the remote that it would use up all of the charge in new batteries in 5 or 10 minutes. I assume there is a reason this boat is on sale for such a low price - it is cheaply made."
1,disapointed,Boat stopped working the first time it was used in water. This is the 2nd boat I've purchased. It was supposed to my nephew's birthday present
3,Get Your Muzak On!,"This is intentional shmaltz. A music-major with a keyboard recorded cover songs of 1993's Sub Pop hit parade. The result is similar to Devo E-Z Listening Vol I. The more familiar you are with the original songs (see titles, above) the harder you will laugh. The songs covered here as muzak instrumentals are the signature ditties from Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, Tad, Pearl Jam, et al."
5,Glad to get it,This is out of print and vanished from the library. This is as exhaustively inclusive as such a book can get. I am thrilled I got such a good copy.
4,HBO FAN ALSO,"I've had this book sitting in my to read pile for almost a year now, and then I saw the show on HBO and realized that I had to start reading it. Martin is such a good writer and, even though I'm watching the show, it's been very hard to put the books down. If you're interested in knights, dragons, loyalty and trust, this is the book for you."
4,Game of Thrones,This is an amazing fantasy with well wrought characters with depth. The imagery is well done and a story line somewhere between Tolkein and Quentin Taratino.
4,Really?!!!,"***Spoiler Alert ***I greatly enjoyed listening to the first installment of this epic tale. My only qualm, and it cost Martin a star, was the zombies. The introduction of these undead characters was brief and unresolved. I'll read book two, but if Martin doesn't weave these characters in to my satisfaction, I'll abandon the series."
5,a game of thrones. book 1,"A game of thrones. A song of ice and fire, book 1.Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. The book is a little different to the current series but still a very good read. I like the way the book details each character so you get to know who everyone is and how they relate to each Other. Im absolutely hooked and cant wait to start reading book two. Hope you think the same."
5,Wonderful Book,Couldn't put this book down. Grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the whole book. So much better than the show.
4,Exhilarating Adventure,"The story is developed through the hearts and souls of its characters and produces outcomes not always predictable, but always a source of promise that there is more to come. The prose flows easily and development of the characters, both good and evil, is masterful! Ordered Book 2 in the series,A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Twoimmediately after reading the last page!"
4,"Poor editing, but great story","This is usually not the type of genre I would pick to read; however, after seeing that the majority of the two thousand reviews were positive, I decided to pick this book up. I am glad I purchased this book; it is full of adventure, action, and deception. The only negatives about the book are the times when the novel/writing is rather wordy, and the poor editing. Since it is over 800 pages, I recommend picking up the kindle edition."
4,"excellent book, HORRIBLY digitized for Kindle","Ill tell you &his; is how this Kimdle book reads.Apparently, scanned in a hurry and then no editing. Shockingly bad, the worst I have ever seen.Great book, but you may want a paper copy."
2,Too bleak,"After hearing so much about this I tried again to get into it (having failed to finish the book 10 years ago or so) but still couldn't. I can understand why some people like the grittiness aspect, but I'm not personally interested in reading about an actual medieval world. By actual I mean that almost everyone is miserable, kind of like a Hobbessian worldview of life being nasty, brutish, and short. I prefer fantasy worlds that are different and a bit more enlightened, or at the very least ones where some of the characters are likeable. I found very few of the POV characters in this book endearing at all, and the ones that are get killed. Bleh.The world is also really low magic which I don't care for. If you are really into medieval politics and a very ""gray"" story, however, this is probably more your thing."
5,Brilliant,"George RR Martin is a genius, i could not put this book down. Right after I finished One, I started Two."
1,DO NOT READ IT - Its depressing !!,"I dont have to argue about author's writting abilities. Its O.K not best but I have came across worst writers.But as far as story goes, this is one of the worst stories i have read. All the good guys die one after another until there are none left and you wonder what the heck is going on. I just dont understand, It's so depressing. I feel the writer hates all the good things in the world !! Sick of him!! I'm never going to read another book by this author !!"
2,Terrible Waste of Author's Talent!,"Mr. Martin is a talented author. His use of words to create pictures and feelings is adroit and rare. Unfortunately his talent made me feel nauseated. I have no need to fill my mind with the images that his words create. I did not finish his first book and will never read another. One never knows what disgusting little tidbit waits on the next page. I for one do not care to find out. If I want to be sickened by what I read I will pick up the evening newspaper and read about child abuse and murder. I read for pleasure and Mr. Martin does not know how to write that. This is one reader who will definitely not be coming back for more, it is just not worth it."
3,Decent,"Not really what I was expecting. I read about it online about how this was a great fantasy fiction series. It's fiction, yes, and part of it's fantasy but is it fantasy fiction in the sense of Tolkien or others? No."
2,YACFS -- Yet Another Cliche Fantasy Series,"Perhaps the people raving about this series haven't read any other books in the genera. This book in particular is so predictable, from the get-go, that it's almost to the point of ridicule. The language is florid, yet purely ornamental. The plot is like walking through a road you've walked on many times before - unremarkably boring. The dialog and characters are cookie-cutter fantasy that pervades the genera these days. If you want to see what I mean by what I say above, read your C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, Jack Vance, Poul Anderson, heck, even Terry Goodkind for something more modern and contemporary. I just don't see what all the fanfare is about."
1,Distracting typos and mistakes,"Regardless of the writing itself, which seems to be ok, this version of the book has so many typos and mistakes throughout the book that it was constantly distracting and irritating. I'd find another version or buy the book in hardcopy rather than tolerate this poorly transcribed version."
2,It's a shame really,"I am going to start off this review with saying that the author, almost, did everything right with this book. The characters are awesome and you feel like you know them, the plot is equally as spectacular, and the writing overall is simply addictive.But with all that said, there is one fatal flaw with this book that made me stop reading it. This novel has an extreme amount of sex. The sexual references are bad enough with multiple instances on every page, not to mention the graphic, highly detailed accounts of sex and rape. The author's description is ridiculously noted and disgusting. I could not in good conscious finish this book, which is a crying shame."
5,One of the best fantasies I've ever read,"In spite of its extreme patriarchical viewpoint (women have literally NO power in this world -- making medieval England look mild by comparison.) this is such a good and well-written book I have to love it anyway.It's hard to find something that hasn't already been said about this novel. It's gritty, it's violent, it's dark. And every one of those things adds to the realism and depth of this novel.Bad things, very bad things, happen to good people. I don't think it resembles that much the War of the Roses, though. Martin may have started there but he's veered very far from that starting place so I suggest not reading for any possible historical references. Instead he has created his own very fully realized world."
5,Wait for the last 3 books to come out,"Excellent book. The first four are out as of now. 1 2 3 are great. 4 is lacking. I would wait till they are all out and you can go through them back to back. I don't want to re read them all when the next ones come out, but im afraid the won't be fresh enough in my mind for me to truly enjoy all the details when I have to wait a few years between books. Great series but definitely wait till theyre all written."
5,Excellent Book,"This is an outstanding story, well written, with excellent character flow. I look forward to reuniting with the characters and the story plot when the next edition comes out. George is a natural for fantasy readers."
5,Powerful mastery of characters!!!,"Being an avid reader of all fantasy books on the market for the last eight years, I found this book to be quite a page-turner for many reasons : First and foremost, the seperation of the chapters describing the characters' view and life within the storyline; secondly, the oh-so many plots and twists the book has within its pages; third, the great depiction of the panoramic and surrounding of each of the characters; ...need I go on? I await the sequel with bated breath and in the meantime, I watch this WebSite about every day for good titles and new ones too!"
2,A dispointing read.,"I had expected so much from this book, what with its award and all the rave reviews I'd heard. However the book was slow going in several places, lots of interesting ideas just fizzled out and left me wondering what the point was. Some of the characters were likeable, and even some of the events were exciting, but mainly it was hard to find anything interesting to sustain the book. The ending just sort of lost its steam half way through and it seemed like the author just gave up and left it that way. There was a great deal of unrealized potential here and I shutter to think that this is just the start of another unending epic. If you want better written epic fantasies try, Fesit, Williams, or even Jordan."
1,Soul Sucking Drivel,"Terrible, worst book I've ever read. No likeable characters, it makes you not care who wins or loses, who lives or dies. The battle scenes are terribly written. A ten thousand man battle and one of the main events was summed up in a few lines by a woman who ""closed her eyes and listened to the sounds"" so you have a few phrases like ""a man's boot sloshing through shallow water"" summing up the battle. The plot and characters are sickening.I want my money back, but worse, I want my time and the part of my soul that got leeched away by this drivel back.So glad I didn't throw money away on the 4 book set."
2,A Game of Thrones is carelessly violent and somewhat shallow,"When I first started this novel, I was impressed with the grandeur and twisting plotline. But as I got further into the book I began to see the flatness of the characture development, and the callous uses of violence. The story itself is slow and predictable and the charactures shallow. I realize that to sustain a story through the viewpoints of many different people is difficult, and while I admire the auther for trying a challanging form of narration, I think that it hurts the development of both the charactures and the complexity of the story. My comments about the violence does not only refer to this particuler book. Fantasy in genaral, except for a few authers, seems to put grotesque violence where it is not needed to make a point. If the auther wantes a character to be villified then incorporate other ways to show it. A Game of Thrones was no exseption.Needless to say I did not finish the book."
3,Little better than average,"My opinion is that Martin is a capable writer, but ultimately I didn't really care about the characters or feel that they had any depth. It was a struggle for me to finish the book, and I feel no compulsion to finish out the trilogy.This book is all mildly interesting political intrigue with very little action. I have no problem with this except that neither the plot not writing style made this work for me. The author did nothing new or unique, and has used a lot of rather trite techniques to advance the plot.Everything in my review covers why in my opinion this book is neither great nor outstanding, BUT it is a solid read. I'm open minded enough to know that some may find this a good book, but I personally would never rave about or recommend this book to anyone."
5,astonishing,I read A Game of Thrones several years ago on vacation. I don't remember anything about the trip other than the plot of this book. I don't think I put it down once! Martin's adeptness with his large ensemble cast of characters is astonishing. This is a true classic.
1,Attracting readers with rape scenes,"I can not for the life of me understand why so many people love this book. While the prose is ok, the rest is third rate. There is very little in this book that i can feel is realistic (yes, i know that this is fantasy). The author seems to feel that the more voilence, the better. There is hardly a page without a sex scen, and a multitude of rapes, discribed in considreble detale. And that some rapeists are discribed as heroes, i find revolting. If you enjoy reading about this kind of thing, then by all means, buy this book, but it is certenly not my cup of tee. If you simply want a great fantasy book, the buy a book from Robert Jordans Wheel of Time series instead. He is, without a doubt, THE master of fantasy."
5,How can I read an 800 page book?,"That's the question I asked myself when I decided to start this book. I had read all the reviews and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I won't bother with plot synopsis because it's too darn complicated, but let's just say this in an engrossing book. The 800 pages flew by and left me wanting more. Although this novel is considered fantasy, you won't be beaten over the head with trolls/orcs/dragons/etc. Aside from the opening and closing chapters, there is no mention of monsters except for Old Nan's tales, a few reanimated corpses and the ever ominous Others beyond the Wall. Make no mistake, there are creatures in this world, they're just not EVERYWHERE. This may bother some hardcore fantasy readers, but the story and character development are so deep that you don't even miss them. A great story, a great writer, a great series."
5,Refreshing (real)fantasy,"A Game of Thrones is the first volume in a series six books. I took a chance and bought the first two volumes at the same time -before I ever read a review of the books and I have honestly never regretted this act. A Game of Thrones introduces the reader to a vast history of humanity, inhumanity and everything in between. The book(s) is full of captivating characters, both horrific and heroic. Encounters within it's pages shape the history of the world and the reader is spoiled in every possible way when it comes to delivering an intriguing plot.You will never know what hit you - but suddenly have to flip back several pages to reread the unfolding events you just saw, heard, smelled and tasted through Martin's wonderful prose.There is little left to say. Martin has created a masterpiece and to try and explain all the good parts of this book(s) will surly take as long as the 700+ pages of the book(s) itself.Make sure to check these series out...Enjoy!"
5,Pretty good,I admit that at first I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I got this book. I was looking for an epic adventure to read. This stood out on the bookshelf and my dad recommended it when I was thinking about it. He runs a bookstore. He ought to know what's what. This is a pretty good story. It's well-written and thoughtful. The characters are wholly believable and details good.
1,Too bad there are no minus stars,"George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones series is a colossal waste of time. I am ashamed to admit I read all five books, constantly hoping they would get better. It's a sad comment on my dogged persistence in the face of overwhelming evidence. I enjoyed J. R. Tolkien's Hobbit/Lord of the Rings and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series and their ilk immensely and was sad to see each end. Mr. Martin's greatest talent lies in convincing the reading public to purchase his stories. Martin takes an interesting theme and that should have been well handled in 400-500 pages and balloons it through five books. He constantly introduces new characters and locations throughout the meager plot thread that are never seen or heard from again thus expanding his page count to no purpose. To say this is bad literature is too kind; it's horrible. I bought the series from Amazon for my Kindle. I wish there was some way to get my money back."
1,"Long on description, short on plot","This book reminded me in a way of Tolken's Lord of the Ring saga with the rich background materials. GMMR has spent a lot of time and effort creating a deep world for the reader to explore. However, Tolken had exciting action and interwoven plot lines, but GRRM's novel has a slow moving plot with little action (at best one could say there is a lot of suspense).I would characterize the novel as a fantasy suspense novel or fictional political drama. Definitely not an action/adventure story. Entire chapters seem devoted to describing a historical incident.I like an exciting story with many plot twists, so I cannot recommend this book"
5,Buy this book...don't wait....you won't be sorry,"This book came highly recommended by two series fantasy readers that I know (All there fantasy books are hardcover, and they read everything and hate a good amount of the stuff) Anyway, I hadn't read too many good fantasy series lately. So was I ever amazed and hooked to George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire seriesWhat I love: Things happen (no stringing one thing out over a handful of books, He starts and finishes major plot lines within a book as well as major plots that are always suprising and fresh). I was in awe to experience the grand ideas and feel the excitement with each chapter (and book). Another thing I liked the women aren't these annoying little pests or male clones in female bodies. Female characters are actually realistic and enjoyable to read about."
4,Game of Thrones is always a win.,"I bought this as a gift for a friend. It was delivered before estimated time, and the quality was awesome. She loves it, and I'm a happy gifter. Great buy! Great series!"
3,It gets worse,"I would advise at least trying this book. I started out loving this series, quickly reading through several, but soon as it progressed it became too dark and depressing. I think it was at the 4th one I gave up. I could have stuck it out if there seemed to be a point but it became gratitious and I could see it becoming like Wheel of Time...just going and going...nowhere. Still, it is complex, original and very well-developed characters. The world seems like it could really exist."
5,Best high fantasy ever!!,"i refer not only to this book, but to all the ones that follow it!I've read them all at least three times, and while I STILL get confused with all the twists and turns, i can honestly say that I have never read a better series! The characters are all so well developed that you can never be sure whether or not you love or hate them (Excpet for Cersei obviously!)and the plots and sub-plots are just mind-boggling! I've enjoyed Jordan's Wheel of Time series as well, but I feel he got a little too carried away and was marking time, george martin's book never give tyou that feeling - in fact im waiting with baited breath for the next installment!"
2,"A great story, but...","This review is for the Kindle edition of A Game of Thrones. Were I reviewing the print version of the book, I would give it 4-5 stars. However, the Kindle edition (for iPad) is full of wretched errors in grammar and formatting that destroy the narrative flow. There are floating parenthesis, random-seeing italic text or misplaced commas every dozen pages or less. Considering how engrossing the book is, encountering one of these instances is like hitting tire spikes during a high speed chase. I hope the Kindle edition is re-editted and updated very soon. I hope the later books in the series aren't formatted so poorly."
2,Great series - if he ever finishes it!,"All the positives written about this series are true - the character development, plot devices, shakespearean killings, and non formulaic writing are really very attractive, and will keep you reading right until the end. And there's the problem. GRRM has not finished the series. The next book was promised years ago, and the estimated date for publication keeps getting pushed out. If GRRM keeps to this pace, the last book will be finished sometime in 2030! It is the opinion of many that he has lost interest, and is now focusing on more important things like the miniseries, and flying around the world to various fan events.Be warned - you could invest a lot of time and money in this series and leave it feeling very unfulfilled.My recommendation would be to leave it on the shelf, and buy something else."
5,Fiction with a dash of fantasy,"After reading several rave reviews I didn't know what I would find between the covers of George RR Martin's book. This book is more like a fictional world that has dashes of fantasy thrown in. It is fast paced, well writtn, full of well-fleshed out characters and a gripping story. This book was definitely worth the read. Between the covers you will find intrigue, politics, humor, heart break, love, sacrifice, honor, magic and dragons."
5,Thrilling read,"I found it very difficult to put this book down.The way each chapter is from the perspective of a different character keeps the reading fresh, and lends to a very cinematic feeling throughout the entire book.The last few chapters I especially felt made everything I had read before worth it."
5,Games of Thrones,Love the series on HBO. It's a little difficult to keep all the characters straight so it's not a quick read. It's certainly worth the extra time.
2,A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One,"Too difficult to follow the story, too many characters, changes in scenery, i couldn't finish the book, especially since it's just a first book in the series, i gave up."
5,Simply amazing,"This book is the most real feeling fantasy I've ever read. George R.R. Martin did a phenomenal job of making each character and event feel so real that visualizing what was going on was effortless. I've read authors that are too detailed and use too many words when trying to describe something, but Martin achieved this with a fraction of the amount of words (despite the length of the book!). He was incredibly efficient with what he wrote down."
4,Intrigue dominates,"The story unfolds in personal visions and experiences and draws me to read further. As I am only half way through, I am anxious to continue to find how all loose ends will weave together."
3,a good read but kind of a downer,"Someone recommended these to me. I liked the first one, but I'm not going to read the rest of the books. Martin has a great style of writing and keeps you guessing, but I found myself feeling depressed and negative about humanity after reading for a while. There was never any conclusion to the plot points; neither during the book nor at the end. The most likable characters just seemed to amble along without any direction and were VERY likely to be killed off (not so bad if there was closure, but like I said, no conclusion to plot points). A little dark and dreary for my tastes. Someone told me that the TV show is great, though, and that it stays very close to the book."
3,Unfinished symphonies,"First let me say that the books are truly excellent in every way. Having said that you should decide, before you begin to read them, if you are the type of person who would read a good book even if the last chapter were torn out.Martin is 63 years old. He's been working on the last book for six years now. If he were to publish the next book today (Jan 2011) and continue at the same rate he could finish at 73. If you plot a curve to allow for the increased time it took for each book he would have to live to 100 to finish them.These could be among the greatest books of our time, certainly the greatest of this genera, but as an unfinished set they are doomed to be nothing more than a curiosity. This is a clear case of Robert Jordan syndrome in the making.I guess I'm glad I started reading them, they are extremely enjoyable, but I suspect I will go to my own grave wondering how the story ended."
2,Thank goodness for HBO!,"Just watch the show. Don't bother with books! Futhermore, at the rate Martin writes HBO will have to decide who wins the Iron Throne."
4,Good stuff,"Since other people have given a plot synopsis I won't do that, instead I will give the reader one more piece of advice. Pay close attention to what GRRM has written, because he doesn't waste words. Every word he writes is significant. This is one of the benefits of GRRM taking so much time to write each book, because every book is so tightly written.After all is said and done, GRRM is not a great fantasy author alone, he is a great writer. He just happens to be a great writer who enjoys writing in the fantasy genre."
4,Great action... far too much tedious dialogue,"2,378 reviews so where to start, eh? Here's the short version. The Game of Throne books have some INCREDIBLE content, but it's inter-mixed with hundreds of pages of tedious, repetitive and ultimately unneccesary dialogue. This isn't to say that well-written dialogue does not advance a fantasy storyline. But in THIS case it's excessive to the extreme.The best way to read these books is to SKIM through most of the tedious dialogue and savor the action scenes.'Nuff said."
5,Fantastic,"There are many, many reviews for this book already; I just wanted to add my 5 star to the mix. This series is amazing. I really enjoy the character chapter style. A long read but well worth it."
3,Disappointed,"From the reviews I read, I expected more. At the end of 800+ pages, I found myself not particularly caring about most of the characters. But I did care that the end of the book didn't bring much of an end to the storylines. It's fine for a book to be the first in a series, but it should also be somewhat self-contained; I didn't feel this one was. And since I don't really care what happens next, I won't be moving on to the second."
1,Overly complicated structure,This novel tries to provides too much structure and a ridiculous number of characters. On three attempts I could not get past chapter three. Save your cash.
4,very very good series,"I guess that one of the reasons why this series is so addicting is that it does not succumb to the normal storytelling dynamics (though some storytelling maniacs could probably fit the template as they usually do... ;) )Anyway, the many small stories in which we follow the different characters adds a lot of suspense to the books."
4,"Great plot, although long-winded","I am a person who enjoys Russian authors and Robert Jordan, but the only gripe I have about this book is that is much too slowly paced. Other than that, the characters are very three dimensional with a great deal of background story (probably also why the story is so long winded). It was a great introduction to the series. After I read this book, I couldn't wait to get to book 2. Sadly, the rest of the series is nowhere near as good as the first book.Enjoyable read, but still second to the Wheel of Time for me."
5,A Game of Thrones A Song of Fire & Ice,Awesome is the first word that comes to mind. I'm hooked and I won't stop till I've read the last page of the last book in the series.
4,"Great book, but beware the maps in the Kindle editions","There are plenty of substantive reviews of this book, and I agree with most of the positive ones. But as a Kindle user who reads a lot of fantasy, once again, the publisher has utterly failed to include usable maps in the Kindle editions of Song of Ice and Fire. You can see the landmasses, but good luck trying to read any of the labels. Simply including scans isn't enough -- when scaled down for the 6"" Kindle, they are useless. Publishers need to break the maps up -- if each map had been broken into two, it would be fine.Fortunately, the Internet can help. [...] has a number of good maps you can use online or download -- search the Citadel's gallery area for maps and you'll find what you need."
5,The Best Fantasy Series. Period.,"Thus far, this series has put every other fantasy or sci fi series I have read to shame. Powerfully described characters, gripping storyline, and an a raw realism that is so rare in fiction. Better than Dune, Ender's Game, and even Harry Potter. I would give this ten stars if I could."
5,Excellent Story,"Game of Thrones is magnificent. Much better than the TV version, as always happens with the adaptations of books to TV or Movies. But the story is very rich in details an extraordinary."
2,Waste of time,It's absolultely astounding that the blurb on the back of the book compares it to The Lord of the Rings. It's a bloody waste of time. Just finished reading the last book and I really shouldn't have bothered. Pah!
1,Simply Lame,"I don't know, honestly, what anyone sees in this book. It is substandard fiction and grossly boring: nothing happens in the first 70 pages. If the author does not bother to structure the plot to make something, anything, happen in the first 70 pages, he deserves to suffer in whatever literary hell there is.The prologue is good, and it made me think that I was about to get swept away into an exciting, richly immagined story. WRONG! The next 60 pages are just boring. The world describes is hardly richly immagined and the language is hard to fall in love with. The characters are just run of the mill genre cutouts. I hate being cheated. This book is simply lame."
1,"**Warning, this series contains sexualy explicit material**","There are several passages in Martin's series that are so graphic, they could not be published on this web site. What does that tell you? If you want to consume filth, save your money and watch some more television."
1,Sick just plain sick!,This book is dark and dreary! Just plain depressing nothing good happens to any of the main people! Not that I want to read super sweet love and kisses fantasy but come on I wanted to shoot myself after I forced myself to read this book! It honestly scares me that so many people love this book! Anybody that can relate to this book is a sick sick monster! I would give it zero stars if I could!
5,A Game of Power and Pain,"This book is something out of the ordinary. Instead of good against evil, (stereo type fantasy) It gives you the charecters and lets you try to figure out who you should trust and who you shouldn't.The two main families are: The Starks who live in the far north and are very harsh, and the Baratheons who rule the kingdom. It begins with the some of the Stark family traveling south with the Kings company and the rest of the Starks staying back at their castle, Winterfell. but before you know it evryone has dispersed off in differant directions and well... the plot thickens. You also can't foreget Daenerys, she and her brother are the last survivors of the old bloodline the Targaryens. Banished arcross the water they are angry, for they want the throne that is theirs by right...And as everyone competes in the game of thrones you never know who will come out dead or alive. This book promises good things to come and provided an endless source of entertaiment!!!"
5,Must have addition to your library,You will love the fact how Martin brings you into the minds of all the charectors. Its a brilliant work. I cant wait for book 4 to come out.I rarely spend the time writting reviews. I am short of words other than you will not regret owning this book. It will bring you much enjoyment.I totally agree with other people. He is much better than Tolkein.
5,Simply Superb,"I was at first hesitant to read this book; however, it turned out to be not only a worthy investment, but one of the best fantasy novels I have read(and its sequels are even better). It is very well written: the characters are intriguing, the story strays from the cliche and completely draws you in. I recommend this book to any and everyone."
2,Great if you like misogynist writing and twincest,"Typical male-written fantasy. Strange sexual pairings, women as plot devices, and so generic it could have been a very long mad lib.I can't say I had high expectations, but I suppose they just weren't low enough to enjoy A Game of Thrones.Points to Martin, however, for getting people to read and buy it."
2,"Starts of Ok, but...","It took me a rather long time to read this book. No, not because of it's length (Just finished Eye of the World in a few days). I was saddened by the fact that a thread could not be continued for more than a chapter. It was something of a plot shattering idea to change the POV every few pages.I was so distracted that I finished a chapter and didn't pick up the book again for 2 months! ( I can barely believe I picked it back up at all!)Over all, the characters are well developed, but a little slow in the head. Could there not be one wise person among them all?!"
1,Here..There and Everywhere,I am in the middle of this book and although I am reading study almost every night I have to agree with some of the other reviewers referencing to the following:a) Lack of actionb) Way too many charactersc) Bland scriptd) Best part was in the first 20 pages....the rest seems to be all down hill.
4,All books fantastic,"Read all four books of A Game of Thrones,I was in for quite an awakening. I was not prepared for my favorite characters to get killed off.It gave me new perspective that good does not always triump over evil. I'm still dazed. I enjoyed the bookstotally,but can we wrap it up already?"
5,Great book and series but,I loved this book and the series itself but wish the author would keep writing. Recommend waiting until series is finished before starting.
2,"Great writing , bleak story.","The book IS bleak and depressing ,however well written. Objectively , very few good events take place in the story. The characters you can identify with seem to have, almost, only bad things happen to them. Maybe it is only setting things up for the future , but if you want something thats fun to read,and that buoys your spirits,DON'T READ THIS BOOK. If you want a story that holds your attention, has intensity, but at the same time brings down your ambient temperature of attitude and hope, read it!"
3,Kindle Edition has many transcription flaws,"I won't deign to review the underlying story here. Instead, I'd just like to comment on the Kindle edition. While I enjoyed the story, there were so many errors in the transcription that clearly no editor reviewed the output from whatever OCR program they used to produce the electronic text. Each one was distracting, and I tried to deduce what some odd word was supposed to be. You can't go more than about 3 pages without hitting an obvious error.So, I would give the story content 4 stars (it's not, after all, Tolkien), but I'm deducting a star for the Kindle transcription. Still recommended, but beware the typos."
3,Oustanding Novel Marred by Typographical Errors,"While ""A Game of Thrones"" is probably one of the finest examples of epic fantasy to have been published in the last twenty years, the Kindle edition is utterly riddled with typographical errors of the most egregious kind. While the text is still readable, the typos are bad enough to disturb an otherwise very enjoyable reading experience.If you plan on reading ""A Game of Thrones"" - and any fantasy fiction fan should - you'd be better off just buying the paperback."
4,outstanding but...,"This has got to be one of the best books that I have read in a long time. It has an excellent plot, great character and a superb writing style. My only complaint is that I really could have done without the raping scenes and other vulger aspects. They did nothing but detract from the story. If not for them I would have given this book 15 stars!!"
4,A great book - but beware of its one (fantasy related) problem,"I'll start by saying this is really a great book. Fun, interesting, filled with complex plots, twists, schemes, battles, cruel enemies, heroic deeds and (almost) everything else one expects to find in a good fantasy book.However, and this was a major let down for me, there is no magic as such. There are small hints here and there but nothing really magical. No wizards, dragons, spells nor anything else in that nature.Though the book is really written well, it might have been a history book. I expect to see some magic in the fantasy I read. It need not be a great wizard or a spell able to transform a continent or a magical soul sucking sword. But I need -something- and that just wasn't there.Other than that, and I admit this is purely subjective, I loved this book. I would have loved it more if it had magic but you get the point ..."
5,Excellent Political Fantasy,"Simply amazing. Not only does this offer all the basic requirements for a fantasy epic--vast world, colorful history/myths,a very complex and wonderfully decietful political backdrop... but Martin's prose in among the best, far better than most the filler on the shelves these days. The descriptions are vivid and lush. Best of all, he really gets into the skulls of the charicters and makes them breath, fear, hate, and love. Recomended."
2,A depressing disapointment,"From what I've read below this seems to be a book you either love or hate. I am one of those who hated it. Martin seems to love making his ""good"" charaters suffer and letting his ""bad"" characters win. The only good part of the book was torward the middle, both the beginning and the end were dreadfully depressing. I felt like burning the book after I finished reading it. The detailed sexual content didn't help it any either. One of the below reviewers called this book a classic. I won't argue. I've read most classics. While most were well-written, like this book, most were also depressing, like this book."
2,I dunno...,"I gather most folks loved this book, and I am sticking with it, but it's a bit confusing at times. If you have a character named Eddard, why does he go by Ned? Keeping up with all the characters, their lineage, and their place in the sequence of things is a struggle and I often feel the author likes to try and put more texture in his descriptions than is warranted. I will say that I have not finished it..."
5,Riveting story,Fabulous book that kept me in its thrall for days. I would highly recommend this one. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
2,Bleh,"It has taken me 4 years to get maybe 1/4th of the way through the book. I'll admit that the writing style is fine. The story line is fine. There isn't any thing in particular that I don't like about it. But, I just can't get interested enough in it to continue. I have the audio version, so maybe it is the narrator that is ruining it. I don't know if I'll try to finish it or not. At this point I can't recommend it, again, not because of any failing other than it can't hold my interest."
1,Another Soap Opera Series,"NOTE: NO spoilers here.I quit at page 134, so I can't spoil much, anyway.So what I'd like to do is save you from the first 134 pages, if it's not your kind of book.This book is a soap opera set in the quasi-Middle Ages. If lots of court intrigue and cruel aristocrats is your thing, you might love this. If you are a lover of Tolkien, Erikson, Donaldson, Moorcock and Brooks--and I'll even add the great SF writer, Frank Herbert, due to his epic scale, historical influence and court intrigue--you still might, but I think you are less likely to. Unfortunately, the Prologue (and the recommendation of a friend) got me to read this--well, to *buy* this--and I've been trying to like it, but I keep reading a chapter or two between other books and I just can't get into it. It's so boring I am simply amazed by the rave reviews.Do yourself a favor and read the first few chapters somewhere before you buy it."
2,ZZzzzz. *Snort*,"Oh, gods... I'm not sure how Martin has bagged such critical acclaim with these books. His stories progress at a glacial pace. This would not be so bad if these were enjoyable characters to follow. They arent. Or rather, the majority of them aren't. If he picked a single character, that might make for interesting reading. Or if the characters were dynamic, that would be alright. The characters are too often like pieces of flotsam tossed on rough seas. Life is like that sometimes. But it doesnt make for good storytelling.The books I'm reminded most of to compare these to are Brin's Galactic Civilization books. He also split the story among many characters. But he did it in cliff-hanger serials with scrappy characters you wanted to like. Martin's characters are an often luckless assorment of not very interesing or fun people with lives that manage to be somehow boring against grand spectacle."
4,Wonderful,"After seeing the HBO series, I became very interested in the story. Haven't seen but one episode and was completely lost. Really good read."
5,My first e-book,"I am a big fan of the TV series. The read is fantastic, it follow the story line of the TV series with certain minor twist. So far the book is not as bawdy as the show, but is more insightful to the characters. The best thing about the book is, it would be a good read even if you are not familiar with the show. The TV show with putting a face to all the characters, but the book dedicates chapters to the different folks to help with the confusion. I am about 1/2 way through the book, and I cannot wait for every opportunity to read it. Am real page turner."
5,Great read,I read this book and enjoyed it so much that I purchased another one for my father for Christmas. It is a great read and I recommend it highly.
5,Most excellent!,Excellent and in depth character development. Fast-paced political action that keeps you turning pages. There's so many different stories going on at the same time it's like a new book every chapter you read!
3,Audio version,"If one likes epic, involved, action-adventure, multi-layered, densely-charactered fiction, this book is a superb read. However, the audio version (narrated by Roy Dotrice, a venerated actor and friend of the author) is barely tolerable. Overall, the characters are given voicings comparable to a group of crotchety old dudes from the Home having a Talk Like A Pirate contest, which was both distracting and exasperating. With no immediate access to a hard copy, I stuck it out to the end, but cannot endure another (all the books are read by Mr Dotrice.) I'll read the rest of the series on the printed page, and look forward to HBO."
2,Too Little Too Late,"This book is meant for the fastidious avid reader. A reader that doesn't mind sifting through a couple hundred pages before the fun begins. With endless lists of names and titles the first half of the book is reminiscent of history text books. However once through the tedium of learning who all of the characters of the book are and the author finally finishes his base the action begins. All in all not too bad, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a fun book to read."
2,Not impressed with the narrator,"I love this series but I personally can't stand listening to Roy Dotrice. He meanders on at a glacial pace and it seems to me that he's only got three different voices at his disposal. He uses his own voice for the POV characters, a voice that sounds old and fat for the non-POV guys, and a leprechaun impersonation for Tyrion. I'd skip the audiobooks for the actual books in this case."
5,Riveting,"Must read. Great world building but not too much and excellent character development, the books only get better. I'm already on the third one in 3 months."
3,Read it to see what all the hype's about.,"It was a fair read, as epics go, but I don't really get what has so many people going crazy about it. It certainly wasn't interesting enough for me to purchase any of the other books in this series. Maybe the show is better, I don't watch TV so I don't know. Again, it's okay, but it isn't something I care to pursue, especially when I compare it to other epics like those written by Brandon Sanderson."
2,Slow,"I read this because I LOVE Game of Thrones on HBO. While the book played out just like the show, I couldn't finish the book. I kept putting it down and not picking it up for days. The book reads much slower than seeing the show, which is maybe why I didn't love it.The characters are great, have wonderful depth and while hating some of them, you still love them.The book just wasn't for me, but I highly recommend the show to anyone who has read them."
2,Reads like a lawn mower manual,"BEcause of the praise for this book, I struggled through. Halfway, I realized it wasn't worth it. The characters have little depth. The personalities are non-existent leaving the reader unable to tell them apart. Everything is handed to the reader leaving nothing to the imagination. It could be a stage play except it is as interesting as the stage directions."
1,Warning for pre-teen readers,"My eleven-year-old son is an advanced reader, and I've purchased many Kindle books for him. I usually don't have time to read as much as he does, so I just trust the reviews and read a synopsis here or there.He began reading this book, and he noticed there was a TV series. When we investigated the TV series on IMDB, we had to discuss the sex and incest in the book. My son said he was enjoying the storyline of the book, but he was bothered by the ""sex parts"" in the book and started skipping over them.The consensual sex between a brother and a sister is really not something I would like my young adolescent reading about. I'm willing to tolerate well-crafted characters who deal with real-life problems--even when those problems are difficult issues, but a character witnessing the incest and describing it was just too much.This series is definitely meant for older teens and adults."
5,You wont want to put it down,"Well developed story, and even though there are several plot lines with multiple characters, the author organizes the story by plot line. Excellent all the way thru."
4,Quite Complex Story,The storyline is quite complex and the author does a good job keeping it moving between the different areas of the world. The narrator does well differentiating the voices and making it feel like an old-England setting.
3,ICE & FIRE 1,A good list of characters and left you thinking about book two. I did enjoy some of the reading and believe I will read book 2 anyway.
5,A very interesting book,"Hello,I really enjoyed a lot this book, it is very nice written. With a plot line that involves you from the very first pages. I love the political issues and conspiracies. It has very real characters that you will love or hate. I recommend it."
5,Game of Thrones Book 1,"Loved reading this on my Kindle, I had watched the first TV series but enjoyed reading the book to explain and fill out the characters and Westeros so much more. Being able to refer to the Family and House connections helped understand some of the very complex game that is being played. Always a shock when a key character dies but there are so many more to follow."
2,Good story? Yes. Good writing? No.,"I've read all three. I am waiting for the fourth, if only because the story never ends, and I guess I need to find out what happens. It's a great story poorly told, interesting, with many plot twists and turns that are so unique and unexpected that they eventually become predictable--what is the worst, most depressing, shocking turn of events that could occur? And it usually does.It's the writing I can't stand. It's terrible, juvenile, wretched prose, with phrases like, ""walking like he had a dagger up his ..."". I've read the story once, and never again. It's a pity that a great story was delivered so poorly, when the author had at his disposal the same language of Tolkien!"
1,It needs a little less sex and a lot more action.,"(...)I would read a book from the romance or erotica sections. I'm not trying to be prudish, but I would like to see a little more sword-play and less sexual chess being played.If you are a D&D; playing, wargaming fanatic looking for some good fantasy battles, look elsewhere."
1,TV vs wrighting,"Disapointed again.I am not a great fan of the fantasy genre but I very much enjoyed reading Tolkien,LeGuin & c.s.lewis.Obviously this Author is being paid by the word & has spent too much time writing fo TV; the characters are as flat as a sceen & the plot could use a commercial every !0 pages or so.A pity the basic ideas did not occur to a more creative writer."
1,Soap opera drivel,"I tried to read this book, but after 300 pages of boring who's backstabbing who, I gave up. If you like soap operas, and obviously lots of people do, then this book is for you."
1,Mindnumbingly horrible,"Martin is one of the worst writers I have ever read in my entire life. He wouldn't haven't a clue if you handed him one. The child sex scenes with adults alone should be enough to give readers a clue that this is the sort of drivel that gives fantasy a bad name. If I read about another clueless 1 dimensional character I'm going to run away screaming. Were the editors of this book asleep at the wheel as well? Martin frequently confuses and misplaces pronouns, nouns and adverbs. I learned how to write better in the sixth grade. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,Won't Finish the Series,"This is a great book, but George Martin will not finish the series. He has left us hanging for years. By the time he finishes the series you are going to have to reread the entire series so wait until it is done with the series before you start it."
3,"A good read, but horrible ending...","A good read, but horrible ending...The Fire and Ice series as a good fantasy epic. Interesting world building and characters that you love and some that you hate. Always interesting when most of the ""good guys"" die. All in all, these were bigs books with plenty of originality to keep a epic fantasy lover happy, but...The series just ends after the third book with no resolution! At lease with the wheel of time we get a new book every few years. I don't know if Martin plans on finishing this series, but if he doesn't, well get ready to be disappointed."
5,Gets my vote for the best book ever written,"Incredible world building, character development, plot twists, intrigue, unexpected plot twists... Martin does it all, and does it well. If you're just getting into fantasy fiction, this the best one to start with.If you enjoy fantasy fiction, and haven't read this series, move it to the top of your list! Everyone I know who has read this (including myself) loves it."
4,very good,"I'm generally not a fan of epic fantasy series, but a friend recommended this novel to me, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I really enjoyed reading it--what appealed to me most were the characters, particularly Eddard because of his committment to his family, Arya, and Jon. Since you're reading from each individual perpective, there are times when you know more than your character-- and I found that sense of dramatic irony to be very effective. The episodic nature kept the action and intrigue fresh, so I never found myself weary of reading. My criticisms with the book are that there were too many characters to keep up with, and sometimes I felt like I was reading towards something that never happens. Additionally, I felt as thought Martin should have included a little more information about the 'common' people of the realm and the general economy (which seem to be tacked on in the next installment as an afterthought). Overall, it was a thoroughly fascinating read."
4,A Good First High Fantasy Novel,"I really enjoyed this book. It was the first true high fantasy I have read. It took me a little time to get into it at first though. The mention of so many names and bloodlines and the geography of a completely new continent pushed me away at first, but it didn't take long for me to get the hang of this world Martin has created. The characters he creates have so much depth. None of them are one-sided and you get to read from many of their perspectives. One of the only things I disliked was the ending. I don't feel this novel in itself was a good story. It was a good part of a story. It was excellent storytelling, but If there was no sequel this story was left completely open without any closure. I understand why they created this into a television series as opposed to a film. There wasn't a clear climax. All the stories of the different characters peak at different points and then peak again multiple times."
1,"I wanted to like this, I really did.","I tried to like it. I struggled mightily, and in the end, I lost. If I had to get slapped in the face with one more perversion: incest, child murder, rape ( after selling your own sister to a barbarian chief that only knows 1 word of your language...""No"") I wanted to bleach my braincells. Alas, what is seen cannot be unseen. So if that's your gig, have at, I'll take my good and bad guys without the hefty dose of Dr Phil-isms. And hope the worthy author exorcised his demons enough with his trip to the bank so that his slumber was more restful than mine that night."
1,No More.,I found it slow-going and long-winded. After the first chapter I found my mind wandering off onto other paths. I've read the lot in the hope it would pick up later... some hope. Never again!
1,"Too big, Too small and Too many","This book ( paperback edition) is 807 pages long, not including the appendix or preview of the next book. The print is too small. There are 46 lines per page with 55 characters per line. This is a huge book! I could not hold the book open with my injured hand. There are far too many different names of people and places. These are not oommon names like Bill and George but Daenerys and Illyrio.This book is fantasy. But there are 4 deaths in the first 20 pages, including one man who is beheaded. I prefer my fantasy a little more upbeat.This book may be the best fantasy book published this decade but I could not get past the physical ""thing"" that is the book to discover that for myself."
3,Just confusing,First the story started out intresting. Each chapter is about a different charakter. But then later on in the book (from page 50) the author adds so mane chrakters and since every chapter is about a different chrakter telling a completly different story it get way confsuing. If you want to read a good fantasy book with no confusing and about only one charakter read the pendragon series
1,"Forced, contrived, lacks natural flow . . .","I bought this book on the strength of other reviews here, but had to stop reading after the first three chapters (something I almost never do) due to the book's overly contrived feel. The main family, the Starks, living on their winter land -- get it?, a Stark landscape. . . The map of the world - a poor rip-off of tolkien with geographic names like ""Red Bay"" and ""Blue Cove"" . . . and the writer's inability to build true tension ""He felt something was wrong,"" ""he felt cold,"" ""he felt forboding"" . . . all conspire to make this a mediocre book and reveal a mediocre writer.Get the real thing - Tolkien, and see what this guy is attempting to emulate. . ."
5,Great Book,The only reason I rated this five stars is because they don't have six stars. If you like adventure / sci-fi / fantasy this (and all the rest of the series) are for you!
5,excellent book,It has exceeded my expectations. I had bought this to do some nighttime reading and now I can't put it down.
1,DISGUSTED,"Disgusted by the trend started by Jordan all those years ago to create the unending series. And now Martin continues the process. How can you really have a voice or a point of view if you just keep babbling on and on?? Finish it even if you give it a lame ending, stop thinking about dollars and more about your craft."
1,Really Poor Set of Books,This is the worst fantasy series that I have tried to wade through in the last 25 years. I gave up close to the end of Book 3. Nothing good ever happens and everyone that you try to pull for in the books are killed or maimed. Doesn't seem to be going anywhere and there is no plot.
3,Great book but too many characters,"Don't get me wrong, the plot and the descriptions in this book were amazing. But there were so many characters I didn't know which was which. And by the end I kind of stopped caring. My biggest complaint though is that the first chapter is the most interesting but the creatures in it are never to be found again in the whole book. Don't know if I'm going to buy the rest of the series or not."
2,Too depressing.,"I know a lot of people who love this series, but personally I can't stand it. The first book is very depressing. I'm told the second book is a lot worse."
5,Incredibly Addicting,"Although this first volume of the series is a bit slow to start, just keep reading and you will find yourself in the midst of a sweeping tale filled with vivid characters and espionage galore. The slight touch of the magic and the supernatural really adds to what is otherwise a realistic-type story. Not only could I not put it down, I immediately ordered volumes two and three from Amazon.com before I hit the last 200 pages. A superior read in every way, and perhaps will appeal to those who do not care for fantasy novels. Enjoy this sumptuous feast!"
2,Mediocre,"I can't see why everyone likes this so much. The prose is plodding, the characters unlikeable and the prose tedious. A tenth grader could write better prose than Martin. I want the prose to sing and the story to engage, not bore me. I tried slogging through the next three too see if it would get better and maybe it did, but not much.Even Terry Goodkind is better than this Martin guy. If you want to read something good, try the ""Way of Kings"" by Brandon Sanderson. He is young still getting better, not over the hill and losing it."
4,Rich and Complex,"A Game of Thrones, the first book of the Song of Ice and Fire trilogy, is a well-written work. The descriptive writing is layered and rich, intertwining with a fairly complex plot. Martin pulls off the essentials of fantasy well: strong world building, unique characters, and sudden plot twists signposted by subtle foreshadowing. If you're going to tackle this novel, be prepared for the deaths of key characters. Clearly, George Martin likes to kill off main characters so as to keep you on your toes. Also, he relies heavily on a Medieval influenced background where ladies are ladies and men are knights, with only the occasional female character choosing the sword. However, his characters leap from the page, and he sets up their internal action/thought in poetic fashion. Overall, worth the read."
5,"Fantasy, mixed with political and machiavellistic insights","At last, a different approach in Fantasy!!!!Most fantasy is characterized by a main figure that meets friends, they split up and each has its own adventure. That is the way that fantasy is written in books of 500 or more pages. It seems to be a race of who writes the thickes volumes, no matter the content. Characters are flat, do not evolve, good guys are good, bad is bad. Eddings is a good example of creating such boaring characters. This story is something completely different. Its changing perspective is a refreshing way of showing how people experience the dawning of a new era. Its full of intrigues and it shows a feeling of how political interests are evaluated.In the reviews I saw many comparisons with Robert Jordan. Although I appreciate Jordan's epic Wheel of Time, this book is of another level. This is absolutely the best I have read in years when it comes to fantasy. I'm looking forward to the next episode!!"
5,excellent story!,"i have never read fantasy before and just happened to be in that area of the bookstore when the cover of the book caught my eye. i read the back and said hey why not? boy am i ever glad that i decided to buy it! this book is fantastic there really aren't enough words to describe all of the emotions that i experienced while reading it. i actually started to panick at the end because i knew i was close to finishing it and book 2 is far from being available!!!! i highly recommend this book to anyone even if you thought that fantasy wasn't for you, you need to try this book and your mind while be changed FOREVER!!!"
5,Wow! HIGHLY recommended!!,"AGOT is adult fantasy at its best. It's a strong and well-written story with a wide range of characters, many of whom you care deeply about. Many years ago, I had read Tolkien and Brooks, but had long since stepped away from fantasy. I now realize that I stepped away because most of it lacked a mature theme and there was a bit too much hocus-pocus. Last year, the cover of AGOT just caught my eye for some reason, and I figured what the heck. Wow! I got hooked! Now I'm looking for more, only it's darn hard to find anything that comes close to measuring up. Tad Williams' classic series has come the closest so far - but nothing else. I have now joined the ranks of those who wait not so patiently for A Clash of Kings to hit the bookstands. I HIGHLY recommend AGOT!"
5,This book will grab you by the fingertips.,"A hard book to put down. The characters in this novel seem to come to life. If you like Robert Jordan or books similiar, then you will completely enjoy A Game of Thrones.The only sad part of the novel is waiting for the sequel."
5,Clear Out Your Schedule,"GRRM kicks off an incredible series. The characters are rich, complex and compelling. GRRM is compared to the venerable Tolkien, but where Tolkien's characters are shining lights, GRRM's are sometimes heroic, other times cruel, at turns repulsive and later sympathetic, depending on the point of view from which the story is told. The result is a brilliant tapestry and a flowing, gripping tale.The book and those that follow are a revealing portrayal of feudalism. The term ""game of thrones"" is used by the characters in the novels to describe endless positioning for power among the 1% of an imagined medieval world.GRRM's understanding of human nature is enthralling."
2,I can't quite seem to put a fork in it,"I'm on page three hundred something and I'm stuck! The book seemed to start so promising, but now has bogged down. The writing is reminding me more and more of Robert Jordan. Too much detail about clothes and buildings and beards, etc. Can we just take it as a given that everyone wears the typical armor described in the story and only tell us on the rare occassion when someone isn't? I will say that, having read Ivanhoe several times, a couple of parts of the story that could have been exciting were only a pale imitation of that classic story (I have no doubt they were based on similar passages in Ivanhoe). Unfortunately, it seems modern fantasy novel sales are driven by page count, not story quality. I already have the next book in the series, but I'm going to have to be a masochist to get through them both."
2,Story is good but don't care about anybody.,I give it two stars because I enjoyed the story. I will not read any of the other books but basically there are only a couple decent people in the story and by the end of the book you are left with people of very bad character or children.
5,Game of Thrones,"This book is incredible to put it plainly. I had my doubts about it until I sat down with it and was completely consumed by its thrilling pages. I am a true Historical Fiction fan at heart, but this just stole me away from it and now I'm a hardcore George R.R. Martin fan. The book brings the fantasy of Knights and high Lords to life in a way I have never read it before. I already have the next book ordered and am dieing to see whats gonna happen next. This is a must buy for anyone who loves to curl up on the couch and get lost in a great story."
5,"Riveting, a big time page turner!","What a great choice it was to expand my fantasy reading beyond Robert Jordan! This book was fantastic! Every chapter, centering around one particular character in the sprawling world Jordan has created, leaves you dying to get back to him or her and see what will happen next. This book pulls no punches and avoids the chaste world of Jordan by addressing the darker side of war and sexual treachery. All of this packed in an amazing fantasy tale and you have a true winner!"
3,Great Story Concept but all Darkness,"Without getting into particulars and ruining it for those who haven't read it this story has some terrific and original ideas in it.Having said that, I just could not get past how wicked the world and the people inhabiting this story were. There was zero redemption or goodness to buoy the reader up which made it a drag to read. GRRM is a talented author, but what I would like him to know is that unrelenting evil might sell, but in this case it prevented a wonderfully conceived story from being stellar. A good book but it doesn't belong beside Tolkien , Herbert or even Rothfuss in my humble opinion."
4,Excellent but painful,"I was extremely glad to find out that this wasn't a stand alone novel. The depth of character will take many more novels to wind its way out. This book had me nashing my teath at the stupidity of some of the ""heroes"", but its brutal style left me unable to put it down. Well done!"
4,Song of Fire and Ice vs. David Eddings,"I don't know which of you uninformed readers posted the review that stated that David Eddings's Mallorean didn't ""compare"" with this to recent novel by Martin and I don't care to. For all of you who are intrested in either of this two series by Eddings or Martin go ahead and read them. Eddings has a less believe system of using magic but the books are all really well written and will leave you with a sense of completion when you're done. The only con to this book is that all the novels are in 'small' bit sized chunks.(400-700 words long) I personally like a longer read so that I get to know the characters better. That's where A game of Thrones really shines through. You will read this book and really get into it. I remember have hard it was after reading the first to wait for the second to come out. Both books are equally good and I recommend both. If you're stuck for ideas on what to read next, check the 25 top books on amazon."
4,Epic,"Well this certainly proved to be as epic as people said it was.I haven't read a fantasy novel for some time but I greatly enjoyed this.Some people have said that there was a shortage of sympathetic characters but I don't really agree with that.It wasn't that predictable and some things happened that did surprise me.It was also quite realistic with even the characters who might seem ""evil"" just acting in the same way that virtually all medieval rulers did act. They were just totally ruthless rather than evil for the sake of it.The language is quite plain but sometimes it is quite evocative. The dialogue is well handled and realistic.It was a little slow moving in places but strangely I was never bored."
5,"At last! Fantasy that is real, believable!",The characters have depth. Martin shows the dark side of human nature yet weaves it into the fabric so that it adds depth to the story....makes it all exciting! The twist and turns of the story keep you in suspense for the entire read. I can't wait for the next book!
5,Great Read,this is the first of the Fire and Ice series and I have to say a GREAT READ. George RR Martin is a good writer one of the best in the fantasy genre. I highly recommend the books.Dealer is quick and sends what you ordered I also recommend them.
4,fantastic fantasy,"I loved the scope of this book and the plotting was well-done. I also liked the characters, which were extremely well-written. Another fantasy that I really enjoyed recently is Roderick Blackwood and The Demon Stone by Ralph Rathbone."
5,Engrossed...even through it all,"It's not often I read something such as this, with this level of detail, and I'm pleased to have found it. George R R Martin uses literary descriptions that are both fantastical and cunning to lay out a massive world before us which plays through many eyes in these seven kingdoms. This being the first book in the series lays out much of the story to come without having too much of a cliffhanger approach. Its girth and content allows for explanation of major events and plays them out to finality while still giving reason to continue on to the next books. I have been a huge fantasy fan for years and have found this to be some of the best writing I have seen in quite some time."
2,Non-Fantasy,"Boring, tedious, uninteresting. The only reason I finished is because I'd gotten so far in hoping for something to happen. Other reviewers compared it to Jordan and Goodkind, maybe if they wrote a history text! I didn't care about the good guys or the bad guys, so as they died it just didn't matter. Magic? It hints at it but never comes through. You want realism rent Braveheart; this is 700 pages of complete droll!"
4,No Tolkien but a cut above many others,"A good effort built on universal themes of honour, love, ambition, greed, friendship etc. The characterisation is shallow; inevitable, perhaps, due to the number of characters. Very few characters piqued my interest (Tyrion, the dwarf being one of them). Still, it was a pleasant way to while away a long and wet holiday weekend."
5,A great job of characterizations and plot twists.,The story of a hardened but loving father during a middle-ages time-like war. Great characters and plot twists. Mr. Martin certainly knows his military tactics and any fan of fantasy and history will thoroughly enjoy this book. I read it three times and am awaiting part two impatiently...
3,Mixed feelings about this book..,"I have mixed feelings about 'A Games of Thrones.'I wanted and was prepared to find the book amazing and un-put-downable, but instead increasingly became a chore to read.Two things kept me reading - I had to find out what happened the Daenyrs and also I was prepared to give the rest of the book a chance to live up to the excitment of her story. In the end, it was as suspected and I was wow-ed by Danys episodes but left feeling a bit beaten up by the other chapters. I ended up not really caring who won the throne and which family came out victorious, which was whole premis of the book - so in this it failed for me.On the positive side I can appreciate the wonderful word-smithing of the author and the awesome way he kept all the threads running side by side without any glitches. However, if I ask myself ""Will I read book 2 in the series?"" - the answer is a resounding ""NO"" - hence 3 stars despite it's obvious worthiness for a higher rank."
1,broad but shallow,"I keep trying to like this book. The wordsmithing is excellent. But I just can't find anything beyond that to recommend it. The characters are flat, the plot is complex but meaningless. Lots of pointless violence and nothing seems to be resolved. The only really interesting part (the north wall) is never fully developed.I don't see what the fuss is about. It just isn't very good."
1,why do people rave about this book,"Why do people love this book, it is so tedious long and boring. You could have told the same story in under four hundred pages. Too many characters and the story is so predictable. I will not be spending money on any of the other books in this serious ."
2,Derivative and Dull,"I don't understand the rave reviews for this book. I can only imagine they must have been written by entry level fantasy readers. Game of Thrones contains ideas, characters, plot lines, and props you've seen in other books, not to mention the medieval setting which is old hat. In addition, there is much flagrant borrowing from Tolkien without the scholarship or depth of imagination. The multi-thread plot structure doesn't work because there are far too many characters, and you don't care much about any of them. Daenerys was the only interesting character and I found myself skipping to her chapters. There are many spots were the writing is excellent and shines but not bright enough to save the novel. I'm glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't pay for it."
2,Not really fantasy,"I finished this book, and at 800+ pages, that means it has some value. However, I had the impression this would be a FANTASY book, not a medieval power struggle that happens to take place in an alternate universe. Aside from the preface, there are no fantasy or supernatural elements in the story until almost 500 pages in.There are many, many characters in the book, and that's certainly daunting when you first start. Add to this the fact that some characters go by different names, and it makes it a difficult book to get into. However, I did get into it enough to read all the way through, and certainly by the end of the story I knew all of the major characters.One other issue I have is that the book doesn't really stand by itself. Things happen, but there's no sense of a build to a climax. In fact, it really seems like a deliberate effort to set things up for the next book in the series. That's fine, but it's better if a book can stand by itself."
1,Great CD!!!,"I wasn't sure I should buy this, but I got it anyway. I'm not sure why everyone hates this book. I mean, it is kind of dumb, but it's OK."
5,Amazing!,"This is a very good book! I'm only 50% done and I'm already hooked! I know what series I'm addicted to! Hey reader chick or dude, you should buy this, you won't be disappointed ;)"
1,Not my cup of tea,"I wasn't expecting Lord of the Rings quality, but so many of my friends said it was a good series so I bought the first book in the series. Thank god I only bought the first one. I find it completely dull and it seems to jump without making decent correlations when going back to a character. I defiantly don't see the hype in it. Next book please!"
4,It is long and many characters to keep track of; very interesting.,I guess I put the review in the wrong place. It is very interesting but a book you should have in hand to review as the characters are so many. Descriptions are very good.
5,Grippingly fantastic!,I had already saw the series and had rave reviews about the books. This book was great; loved getting all the detail around character development that you normally don't get from watching the show.
5,A Game of Thrones,I watched the series on hbo and got very interested in the books...they are so much better than the show! If the show interests you at all the books are a must read!
2,Stand alone - Good. Epic - Bad,"The first book is readable and even quite enjoyable, but the language (She was a women ""flowered"") repeated over and over gets a bit hard to take. In later books of the series you really have to been keen to keep reading as they become harder and harder to stay interested in each story line."
5,5 stars is not enough!,"I have not read the sequels to this book, but I can say that this book is easily the most enjoyable book I have ever read (including Tolkien). At first I thought I would never be able to remember all the characters that Martin keeps introducing but he gives them all enough attention relative to their importance that the narrative of countless linked subplots flows seamlessly. His characterisation is brilliant, especially for female characters. This is the first book that I have read that didn't seem to waste space. Every chapter is nice and short and delivers plenty of plot development. Almost every chapter seemed to contain a story twist, varying from small and delightful to shocking. After reading this book, it feels as if the bar for fantasy writing (although fantasy elements are only subtle in this book) has been raised much higher. Compared to some other things I've seen rated 5 stars, this easily deserves 6."
5,A sin not to read,"Wow. This is easily the best book that I have ever read. The author, George R.R. Martin, does away with the tired fantasy cliches that started with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Instead, he tells an incredibly complex yet very readable story from the eyes of eight distinct characters. It is truly fascinating to see so many different viewpoints, and the level of depth to these characters' personalities is almost frightening. I was also delighted to see that this book breaks the ""good guys always win"" trend which seems to have an iron grip on most fantasy novels. The last few chapters in particular are refreshingly unpredictable. Finally, this epic is capped by a stunning ending that somehow manages to provide a great lead-in to the sequel without being too much of a cliffhanger. The pages of this book are worth infinitely more than any paper in your pocket."
5,The Best Book I've Read In Years,"George R.R. Martin weaves a gritty realistic world wherein characters and events take on a vivid life in the readers imagination. I espescially love the way Martin continually surprises me. All too often I read supposedly acclaimed novels wherein the author keeps telegraphing the unfolding of the plot to the reader. Not so, Martin! Time and again I was shocked by the fate Martin had in store for characters he made me care about. This is truly a novel to get lost in.... you won't want to put it down. One walk through the eery crypts under Winterfell, or perhaps a drink with a certain cunning yet misshapen dwarf, and you will be hooked on this series."
4,"Good read, bad feeling at the end!","As I began to read this book, I was impressed by the details and the excellent character development. I loved the tangle of sub-plots and the reality of the situations. However, after I put the book down, I was disappointed. So many of the situations near the end seemed extremely violent and shocking, as if the author didn't really beleive he could hold onto a reader with old-fashioned excellent writing and must throw A LOT of really nastly things in for shock value. I felt like I had inadvertantly watched an episode of springer. Good on the whole, I'll read the next one, but left me feeling a little yucky."
1,This review is regarding the Kindle Version ONLY,"I love this series. I have read books 1-4 over and over again. When I saw HBO was shooting Game of Thrones, I wanted to read it once more before that series begins next year, so I grabbed the Kindle version.The amount of typos in this version is completely unacceptable. It was obviously transcribed and never even perused before being uploaded. It makes Bantam look bad, makes Martin look bad, and makes me so mad that I am having a hard time enjoying the book.The types of mistakes range from the most basic: a completely wrong word such as ""he"" instead of ""had"" or a basic typo such as ""sex"" instead of ""ser"" to the unexplainable: italicizing a word and splitting it into hyphenated syllables for no apparent reason. It is averaging an error each page near the end, as if the transcriber had checked out completely by this point.Do yourself a favor, especially if this is your first time reading this amazing book. DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE VERSION!"
4,Very good,"Great story. Vivid characters and action. George RR Martin paints a world in which magic and wonder form the bedrock of a believable scene of love, treachery, valor and deceit."
5,Great!,"Normally, I read the book before I watch a series. This time, however, I reversed the order because I didn't have time to read the book prior to watching the series. The book has multiple plots that really pull you in. It is easy to see why the series was easily put together and followed the book very closely. Still a great read even after watching the series."
5,A great read!,"This book was great. Martin doesn't hold anything back. It was refreshing to read a book where almost no one is safe. Danerys chapters were a little slow but get increasingly better as the book goes on but it's doesn't ruin the story as she only makes a small part of the whole. This book and the Series (A Song of Fire and Ice) has been what I have measured every other book I have read since against, And most have paled in comparison."
4,"Exciting fantasy, don't miss this series","This book was quite good, and a bit of a turn from what I normally read. It took me awhile to get into it, as the book is so long and there are so many characters, getting into the world in the series seemed a little tedious at first. That said, once I got the hang of it and began to understand the world, I really got into it. The character development was great, and I loved how the twists and turns shaped the story. I have to say, the plot twists in this novel are amazing. You never know what each character will do, and it is a captivating read because I kept wanting to see what would happen next. I have to admit, this book gets 4 stars from me instead of 5 just because of some of the violence towards the children. Yes, there is violence towards children in this book. It is part of the story, and part of the fantasy world, but it's not always easy to read. I am very eager to begin reading the next book of the series."
5,Best thing I've read since Tolkien.,"Tolkien set the bar very high with Lord of the Rings. I found most books in the Fantasy genre to pale by comparison, until I read Game of Thrones. It is beautifully written and crafted, a masterpiece of story-telling, and George Martin's control of his character development and plot lines is masterful indeed, considering how many of them there are. I have since watched the TV series and love that it sticks to the book so well. Why wouldn't it? All the work has been done in the book - the characters, locations and dialogue. Just move it on across to the screenplay. I'm now rereading Game of Thrones and watching each TV episode as I finish the relative section of the book. What a treat!"
1,difficult and confusing characters,"This trilogy was recommended to me but I found that I couldn't even get through the first book. The chapters are broken up by characters (which have unusual and difficult to pronounce names). It was an effort to follow on an e-pad because I wanted to flip back to previous chapters to remember who plays what part in the story. It's not clear about who are the good/bad guys, which can be fun, but not when the characters are numerous and confusing. About halfway through I gave it up. Probably would have been a decent read in paperback form."
3,"A game of thrones, fire and ice book 1","It is a good read but there is some confusion while reading as to who is who as there are many names similar. Also the two story lines don't quite mesh...I still am not sure what one has to do with the other, but will read on...."
5,Modern Masterpiece of Fantasy,"Why you should read this book:1. You've read ""Lord of the Rings"" and feel unhappy because you think you'll never read a book as good as this again. - You're wrong2. You always wondered what it was like to live in the middle-ages.3. You're tired of characters that are less intelligent than yourself and want to be challanged while reading.4. You're tired of semiocre writes living by semiocre books with semiocre characters doing semiocre deeds.5. You know that ""receiving"" means ""giving"" - and that applies for good books too.I just feel sorry for everyone that has not read this one."
4,I'm Hooked,"Get absorbed into this world of plotting, wars, subterfuge and greed, over the thrumming of the coming apocalypse. Don't miss Book one of the Game of Thrones!"
5,Great Read,I am not a big reader but am trying to become one.I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend. At first I didn't think I was going to like it because of how the author jumps around from chapter to chapter with each charecter. Once I got to know each one I actually found myself having a hard time putting the book down because I could not wait to get back to each one to find out what happens. As soon as I finished the first book I watched the first HBO season. I am now reading the second book and will finish in time to watch the whole second season.Overall I think this is a great series especially if you enjoy reading stories from this era in time.Two thumbs up!
3,Review of book one,The ending was very good. The finally was the most interesting part of the book. Central portion of the book was ok. The writing style and use of language as well as the vocabulary could be better. Certainly not intellectually challenging. Definitely not Tolkien.
1,Insufferably dull... tedious... monotonous...,"I picked up this series based on the recommendation of several folks over on reddit and I have never been more disappointed in a fantasy series. I've read an awful lot of books, Tolkien, Lewis, Howard, Lieber, Zelazny, Brooks, Eddings, Jordan, even Martin's other works where he edits the sci-fi ""Wild Cards"" universe.Nothing is as completely uncompelling as this series of books. The first book which this review is about, features NOTHING happening for the first 400 pages. Nothing. If you're looking for something other than political back-biting you're reading the wrong book.There is room for castle intrigue as a part of any fantasy series, sure. But to make that the prime mover? The main plot itself? Someone please stick a sword through my head.Put it down. Walk away. Go pick up ANY other fantasy novel and you'll be better served."
1,A lousy story,After reading this book for about a day I couldn't make sense of it because it bounces around so much between characters that it loses it's heading. I quit the book and got a refund
1,kindle variant only,"The entire typeset for the kindle version is atrocious. The editing was done so poorly that most of the sentences make absolutely no sense and it seems as if its not quite written in English, or any variant of it! Overall the kindle version is not only bad but it's a disgrace to the book as it discourages new readers!"
4,Do not read this until the series is complete,"The book's very well written. However, there is no end in sight.He released four books from the series out from between 1996 and 2005. In six years since, he has not completed Dance with Dragons, the fifth book of the series. There are still two more books scheduled to be released after Dance.Be warned that he may not finish this series. If you start you may set yourself up for disappointment. Wait to see if the full ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series gets completed before starting any books.I was hoping that the HBO contract would entice him to finish up the series, but based on HBO's past performance (Carnivale, Deadwood) I won't hold my breath."
3,Well written - but relentlessly bleak,"I know so many people who rave about this series that I got the first three and settled down to read with high expectations. But I'm floundering half-way through the first book. Yes, the characters are well-done (I especially like Jon Snow and Daenaerys), the setting is fascinating (I love snow and mountains and the desert), the writing is excellent - but oh my lord, I am longing for a break from the unending betrayals and backstabbing and anger and lying and violence. It's not that I mind the things of the shadow, far from it - but the shadows show up much better when they're contrasted with light. Martin keeps us groping in the dark all the time, and it's exhausting! Tolkien knew enough to give us the occasional respite from the danger and evil by letting us rest for a chapter in the Shire or Rivendell. There's no sanctuary here - or if there is, I haven't gotten to it yet. Please tell me there's something good coming if I keep reading."
5,A work of Art!,"After having finished a game of thrones, I sat dumbfounded. How could a book be so rich in detail and plot. I've also read the Robert Jordan series and despite being excellent, they are a bit tedious at times. But a game ofthrones is an adventire the whole way. The characters are so realistic that you grow to hate Joffrey and Cersei but almost fraternize with Jon Snow, Robb, Ned etc. I would recommend this to anyone who loves fantasy. I'm about to start the second one. Can't Wait!"
5,great read,"I like many other people im sure, went to Mr. Martin's books after being disappointed by Robert Jordan's bloated and tired old WoT series. Martin's books are gritty, real, and don't pull any punches.Now, i do think that Martin maybe tries a little too hard to be ""realistic"" by killing off every possible character that we might've loved. But hey still the books are a great read, if a bit raw for a younger crowd, but damn theyre a good read."
5,One of the best ever,"Martin does a great job of bring his world to life, with deep discriptive writing, and a thick history. He also presents a vast knowledge of war in the middle ages, and fullfils each aspect that you could ever want: Adventure, betrayal, action, love, and intrigue.The book did a great job of keeping my attention, and answering each of my question, he left alot for imagination, and yet enough to get the story across. Definatley one of the best books I ever read"
3,The last thing this book needs is another review,"Read this book after all the hype with the TV show. The only word I keep coming up with to describe it is that is is ""fine"". It didn't leave me excited and itching for more but it succeeded in not feeling like a chore. Most of the characters are pretty one dimensional and Martin tries to play with this lack of nuance within the characters but given their simplicity it becomes pretty predictable."
2,Not fantasy,"Don't expect fantasy. Expect a political book in a medieval setting. This book is lauded for it's ambiguous characters, however if you are ever surprised in this book by any character OTHER than Tyrion...If you like pages of descriptions of food, clothes, and weaponry with political backstabbing. This is your book."
4,Entertaining,I have been wanting to read this series of books for a while. I was very easy to purchase. Very exciting book and I am only on chapter one.
2,"Arrrrr... avast, ye matey!","Why on Earth does every single character in these audiobooks sound like either a pirate or a leprechaun?!It's all but impossible to tell one character from another when they all sound like they're doing a third-rateimpression of Blackbeard! It borders on the comical... and becomes tiresome after the 500th ""different"" character that soundslike every other character.Want to enjoy an audiobook by someone who knows how to perform asdifferent characters? Pick up any of the Harry Potter books as read by the brilliant Stephen Fry!"
5,Amazing,Most amazing book ever realistic and yet filled with different monsters and magic. Even as good as Lord of the rings
5,Wonderful Read,"In the tradition of ""Mists of Avalon,"" Martin's series of books really propel the reader with exquisite character development, intelligent style, and the ability to hold the reader's ""suspension of disbelief"" so well that I have started to use vocabulary only found in Martin's imagination in everyday life!The story of several warring nobles houses is compelling due to its sense that no one house is just. Each family has a certain amount of good and evil, and because of that, relating to them is not so difficult. I often find that in reading books about the fall of nobility (think ""Gone with The Wind""), I have trouble identifying with the characters, but in Martin's novel, I certainly do not.I highly recommend this book and hope you found this insight helpful."
5,Game of Thrones,"... We now have a book with an author that know exactly what he wants to do in his story, and knows exactly how he is going to get there. And I love that in this series there is no clear boundary between good and evil(a few exceptions). For instance, a bad guy like The Hound, or Bronn the sellsword, can actually become likeable characters later on. The story focuses on two families, The Starks(likeable) the Lannisters(spoiled rich little punks) and the tidings of war. These families better get their acts together or their they will lose more than their honor when the Others cross the wall."
3,Game of Thrones #1,"I bought this because I had heard a lot about it. The story was absorbing, but very dark. In fact, at the end of the book, I could not really remember any happy parts in the whole book. The ending does make you want to find out what happens next, but not enough to wade through more violence and pain for the characters. Don't think I will continue the series."
3,Eh.. not thrilled,I think this might be the first time ever that I liked the on screen version better than the book. I just wasn't thrilled with the writing. I like having rich images in my mind while I'm reading things and this book kind of left me hanging. It seemed like several times the author would carry on a conversation between people that he had never described before so my imagination didn't really know what to create. Maybe it's just me but I definitely got bored and quit reading about 3/4 through
2,disappointing,"I agree with Amanda's review and would add that the repetition and the unrelated (re: plot) digressions make for a dreary read. I actually enjoyed Book I, started flagging through II and III, and then fast forwarded on my Kindle through IV. The violence, the sex, the betrayals--same old, same old. In particular, his female characters are major disappointments. Martin does seem to have an adolescent view of women's sexuality."
4,Great introduction to one of the best fantasy series of our time,"The trailers for the show hooked me, and I got the books before the series aired. I loved them all. This series has filled the Harry Potter-sized hole I had, having grown up with that series.Game of Thrones is a perfect introduction to Westeros, its families, and its conflicts. Intricately plotted, deep characterization, and great writing, this book is a must-read for anyone."
1,Great Book but misleading picture,"Bought this book hoping for the old edition cover as a collecter piece as pictured above, got an overpriced (58.44) copy of the new reprints with the new covers. Not sure how they get off stating it is a hardcover import from 1996, when it has the new reprinted covers and stickers from Manchester Public Library, Whiton Memorial Branch, 100 N. Main St, Manchester CT 06040. Thanks for overcharging me and scamming me out of shipping."
2,Not interesting to me,"I was recommended to the Game of Thrones and thought I would read the book since I don't get it on television. To be honest, I got bored with it."
5,Awesome,"Can't wait to start book 2! Was hooked right away, now I'm going to watch the first season .Enough said"
4,song of ice and fire,clash of kings series or song of ice and fire etc was asked for and given as a gift. The person to whom the this one of several we bought for him was liked and read all of them. that is what novels are for = for the person for whom gifted to enjoy and read..
4,Great book!,"The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that there are so many characters involved it's hard to keep up with everyone! Given that one small issue, this is an awesome book!"
2,Barely finished it (minor spoiler - no specifics),"Why is it that some fantasy writers feel the need to have ridiculously bad, over-the-top villains pitted against really likable characters and then inflict so much pain and anguish on the latter? It's formulaic and predictable (gee, I wonder if the ""bad"" people will get their comeuppance in a later book?)My other problem with this novel is it's lack of really original ideas. Sure, all literature borrows from and expands on previous literature. This book, however, seems only a partially disguised regurgitation and remix of ideas from other fantasy books (especially Robin Hobb's Farseer series).Consequently, I was, in turns: frustrated, annoyed, bored and depressed. Like a long bus ride, I couldn't wait for it to be over. No thanks, Mr. Martin, I'll get off here."
3,Poorly written...,"With this story I wanted to be present with what was happening, but the authors choice of writing style did not allow it. The passive voice and god perspective are both present within the narrative of Game of Thrones, and the end result is a good story with lazy writing. This story deserved to be written in active language, and in a way that shows the story happen not tells you what HAPPENED. Unfortunately, too many writers passively in order to cover more ground within their stories, and while it may be necessary for large ones like this, the reader doesn't get the full experience. Thus, Game of Thrones was a bitter sweet venture for me, but it's a good story and I would still recommend it to anyone."
3,First Martin book,"I read the first chapter and I locked onto this young hunter type kid... then Martin kills hime off. Atypical of the genre. Don't get too attached to anyone, Martin likes to kill them off.Its a good book, and Martin jumps from one character's perspective to another, which keeps it from getting dull."
2,I wish I could review this better.,"Mr. Martin has created a fabulous setting rich in description and detail. Those who indicate that his world is realistic are all too truthful. There are elements of society and passion which can be cleverly expressed without the full breadth of their evil being obvious. Murder your king if you like, sleep with your sister too, but save me the atomic level of detail. Mr. Martin, you are a fine writer, and it is sad that you foul the otherwise crystal waters of this novel with your crude and tasteless fantasies."
2,Not as good I thought it would be. But I could see how others would like it.,"I am a huge fan of fantasy and science fiction. I have read J.R.R, Feist, Anthony, Goodkind, Salvatore etc. etc. From what I can tell in the reviews is ... if you like the types of books I read then you may not like this one. It appears that those who like to read say...Koontz, murder mysteries, medieval classics or even some romance novels would really enjoy this book. I, on the other hand, did not. It was extremely slow moving and had similar dialogue to ""pride and prejudice."" The plots were very subtle and the switching from character to character was tedious and hard to follow. This is the first book I ever stopped reading half way through and have no desire to go back to it. With all the good reviews I wish I liked it, but I am glad others really enjoy it."
4,Game of Thrones,"I was not sure about about getting into this series because I had watched the adaptation of this, the first book, on TV. Invariably this means that the characters would forever be what the TV show made them. However, after such heady praise as, 'the Tolkien for our time' or 'American Tolkien,' I decided to take the plunge and I am glad I did. The first book was brilliant and the characters I had met on screen were given depth and colour. I am starting the second instalment now and I doubt the books will be far from hand until I have finished them all."
4,Good read,"This is not the best fantasy story ever written, but Martin has the storyteller's ability to draw you into his world. I thought the characters were fairly well developed and usually not one-sided. I liked how even the ""good"" queen had a nasty streak when it came to her bastard son, and the ""bad"" characters can be almost likeable at times (the Imp, for example). Interestingly, the really bad characters are mostly spoiled children drunk on power. Overall, a very entertaining story and I'm looking forward to the second."
5,Standing on a wall of Ice,"Tyrion and the wall,It has been some time since I've taken the time to share my thoughts on a book I've read.Currently I'm standing on a wall of ice 700 feet high with a curmudgeon dwarf of a man and a boy and his wolf.I've not been as captivated since my first read of moria. Please keep it up George, I need the distraction of your great writing to lead me from the mondane world.Sincere thanks!"
2,Wasn't what I expected,"I purchased this book after watching a commercial for the TV series (which I haven't seen yet.) I only read the first few pages and had to give it to someone else. It was just talking and sword fights, which was disappointing."
3,Ok Experience,"I was mostly happy with the purchase experience. I was very pleased with the timing of the shipment. The book arrived in ok condition. I had thought it was sent ""new"" but when I received it, the cover was bent and did not look like new. I did not really mind as once I read the book it was creased anyway but I figure it is fair to write about the condition received."
1,Smart people doing silly things,"The plot of this book relies too much on supposedly reasonable people committing unreasonable, rash acts rather than having a simple 5 minute conversation that would clear matters up entirely.It relies on supposedly reasonable people festering intense enmity rather than asking some simple questions.It relies upon layers upon layers of impossibly intricate schemes and machinations succeeding perfectly.It relies on authorial convenience, deus ex machina, and impossible coincidences."
2,Slow!,"I ALMOST gave up on this book about halfway though. I was thinking to myself, ""where is this book going?"" Towards the end something DOES actually happen! Wow! I don't see how people can say WoT books are so boring then say this is great? There is so little action in this book, I truly believe there is more [harlets] and [intercourse] in this book then anything else. Believe me, this book isn't terrible, but if you don't read it, you're not missing all that much."
5,Well done,I saw the first episode and had to run out and buy this book. This was a great fantasy novel even for someone like me who doesn't like this genre. The characters and scheming is fantastc and so is all the fighting. And the story is very well-written. Well done.
4,Complicated Medieval Political thriller,"I had never heard of this series of books before the series on HBO; so I decided to get this to get a better feel (since most movies and TV shows tend to either re-invent or leave out great chunks from the books they purport to be based on). This recording with Roy Dotrice (""Father"" from the old Beauty and The Beast TV show, coincidentally co-produced by George R.R. Martin) is wonderfully read and characterized. The story is more than a medieval fantasy--akin to the Dune books--it's a complicated political thriller that HBO faithfully adapts it's series to.My cd's arrived on time and in good condition. Good experience with the seller."
1,Throw this book out the window into a steaming volcano,There is only one author with a double R in his name which writes fantasy so well. And George R. R. Martin is not this AUTHOR! By all means stay away from this book. If you so choose to read this be warned that this book is not for the young. Many reasons point to that. To many to explain. The worst part about this is that every chapter there seems to be a new character. Then you never see the old characters again. There was only one character I liked and he never got the light on him. Terrible!
2,Why Robert Jorden is better .............,"Yes, I am aware that Robert Jorden needs to get his act together but at least he dosen't have to resort to characters with a vocabulary limited to four letter words. I was disapointed to find that every other word in this series was a cuss word. I think a real writer can develop his character's thought and feelings without using bad words. For example, Robert Jorden uses almost no foul language or explict sexual situations in the 'Wheel of Time' series. For those of you who like a good clean book, stay away from George R.R. Martin."
5,Characters that matter,"So many fantasy books depend on the setting -- a magical world filled with mythic monsters and powerful wizards. But A Game of Thrones is a fantasy book that focuses on its characters rather than its setting. In fact, I often forgot I was reading a fantasy novel. But that didn't matter because Martin's characters filled the pages with so much energy that it didn't feel like anything was lacking.That's not to say that a fantasy world doesn't exist in the book. It broods in the background. There are references to important places and people and events, but these always seemed separate from the main plot. By the last chapters, however, Martin starts to push the world into the forefront, and you realize that the world is about to intrude itself into the lives of all of these great characters."
1,You've GOT to be kidding!,"ALthough the style is magnificant, and the words well chosen and strung together, the story itself is a big disappointment. True, you have no idea what is going to happen throughout the book,but that is not because the plot contains many twists and turns -- rather it is because there are so many characters and each chapter does not contain much memorable action such that the book itself is choppy and not as interesting as the concept actually is. If the concept of this book interests you, you would be better off reading the actual accounts of English history. I was very disappointed by this book, the plot was quite blaze and the ""fantasy"" portion of this book was nonexistent."
1,Oh No!,"I'm sorry, but I just don't get this. I had to read this as I'm a big fantasy fan and this is all over the television. I tried the TV show and got bored and hoped the books would be better. This one certainly isn't. I half feel as if I'm missing something but this just reads like a huge list of made up place names and people and lots of talking and political plotting interspersed with bits of adventure as a sort of add on. Not my thing at all. Bring on the simple action heroes for me! No politics, just kill the bad guys and rescue the princess, that's what I want."
2,a huuugely overrated book,"- First of all, make no mistake, this is NO fantasy, but a rather a grim and depressing pseudo-historical novel in slightly unusual decorations. Rare attempts to make it different from the real dark ages look awkward more often than not. There seem to be no message, except that the world is a cruel place and it will only get worse;- It's hard to sympathize with the characters, since most of them are either children or teenagers with unstable psyche, plus the author enjoys killing those few that are likely to be considered positive figures (and he does it in a way to tease the reader the most);- Sex and violence descriptions are abundant and gratuitous, and often feel totally unnecessary"
1,If I Could Only Give Zero Stars,"This has to be one of the most over-rated books I've ever read. I honestly could not finish it.1. It is extremely slow. Only Jordan has this author beat as far as using the maximum number of words to explain the most mundane things.2. Dialog is unreal and contrived.3. I really did not care for the obscene material. I felt it was uncessary to the plot and character development. WARNING if you care about that kind of thing or are considering buying this book for your kids, I'd rate it X... Definitely. And there is no hesitation in that at all.4. Very trite. You'll feel like you've read about these characters before and you know what? You have! Fantasy does tend to be very restricted in its form but how come I don't feel this way when I read Stephen Donaldson, David Gemmell, or Raymond Feist?Do yourself a favor... skip this series all together and read something else."
4,Suprised (in a good way)!,"Normally, I do not read fantasy novels, but a friend gave me this to read on a road trip. I was suprised to find myself enjoying it. The book has excellent plotting, intriguing charachters, and is well written, things I don't normally associate with this genre (I realize there are probably some phenomenal fantasy novels out there, but they seem to be outnumbered by the dreck). For some reason, most reviews I've read of this book seem to focus on the amount of profanity and sex; this took me aback somewhat, as I did not notice a remarkable amount of either. Any modern crime novel (most modern literary fiction, for that matter) has far more. I guess most fantasy must be filled with rainbows, unicorns, care bears, and happy endings. This book has none of them, luckily. I enjoyed the fact that even the ""evil"" characters are multi-faceted and complex, and that many of the ""good guys"" have dubious motives, lack backbone, or commit moral lapses. I can't wait to read the next one!"
5,A Fantasy Classic,"After checking in with the Science Fiction and Fanasty Web Forum, and reading all the kudos this book received I thought I would give it a try. I Have not enjoyed a book as much since reading LOTR or the Wheel of Time Series. This is a superb novel , while a little slow to get started, by page 100 I was hooked and could not put this down. Strong characters that make you root for the good guy... but who are the good guys?On to book 2!"
5,A very well written epic,"Definitely worth a read through. In the novels, the well-developed characters are multidimensional and true to form. It is refreshing that the characters in the series experience true losses and not just temporary setbacks that come out for the best at the close of the story. Overall a very well written peice of work. If epic fantasy is your genre, I would strongly advise you to take a long look at George Martin's work."
5,Not A Fanatasy Fanatic,"I am not much of a fantasy fan, but wow! This guy weaves an engrossing tale. I was warned by a friend who gave me the first book not to get attached to any of the characters. He was right as Martin has no qualms about killing them off. A previous reader gave this one star and I would dearly love to know his favorites because I have never read anything better."
2,Fantasy Soap Opera,"There's only one way to describe this book: a Fantasy Soap Opera. This has EVERYTHING you get in your favorite soap opera: 1. Lots of characters 2. A story that takes FOREVER to develop, and even longer for anything to happen, and has no end in sight 3. Sex and infidelity/immorality galore, sometimes more explicit than necessary (yes I know these things happen in real life, but we don't need explicit details to get the picture) 4. A story with many threads, each thread getting its turn in little snippets - VERY little snippets.Not to say that soap operas are necessarily bad, but they definitely aren't my thing, and neither was this book.Another thing that turned me off was that this didn't have any of the fun magical-type things you get in other fantasies. Isn't that what fantasy's all about?"
2,Fantasy Soap Opera,"It's ""Dallas"" meets ""Fantasy Epic"". Martin is a better fantasy writer than most, but sadly this book is no masterpiece. He touches on an interesting story, but gets bogged down in the soap opera in which his main characters are playing.If you are more interested in interpersonal relationships than a gripping story then this book will sit well with you.If you are looking for a good fantasy yarn, then keep looking. This is fantasy for those who like ""he said, she said"" stories."
1,Worst waste of your time in a fantasy novel.,"Anyone thinking about getting into the Fire and Ice series should stop listening to this induced hype and read a better series. These books are a horrible, pointless waste of your time and money.Without giving away any real spoilers, I'll say this. There are really only a small handful of characters that you won't hate. All of them stubborn, mean, racist, incestual or greedy. ALL OF THEM expect of about 3... and those 3 end up dead at the end of the book or exiled or whatever. Without any heroic characters in a story where the ending can best be described as anti-climatic, what is the point of reading the book?If you want a good fantasy book, look elsewhere."
4,The best of the bunch.,Mr. Martin succeeds in creating a rich world full of human characters. This book succeeds where his later works fail by maintaining a coherent focus.
3,Overrated (not bad),"First of all, I really tried to like this book. I read the previous reviews in this page and I bought the first and second books at the same time. Then I started to read it... It was quit disappointing.What I don't like about it:- Too long, I mean, there are 400 page without any value (I've read ""war & peace"" and I didn't find it too long)- Any time that the story is getting interesting it turns to another chapter without connection with the previous one and it begins a description of a room or castle or whatever.- At the end, It indeed turns out to be more fun, but I don't dare to read the 900 pages of second book.- And Yes I did finish it.What I like it:- It is a very good story.It could have being a page turner but first it should have skipped many pages or even chapters."
2,"Too much, Too Fast","I did not love A Game of Thrones, but by the time it ended, I felt like I needed to find out what more happened...So, I picked up the next book, and now I'm HOOKED! HOw many books are going to be in this series? I can't have another Wheel of TIme on my hands. I hope it gets wrapped up, so I don't have to wonder for the rest of my life how it ends or wait for a new book every two or three years..."
3,Excellent But...,"In character development and in presenting the details of an alternative civilization, this book ranks among the best. The integrated detail of the characters' lives and the intrigues are also among the best. The readability of this book is excellent.So, why have I rated it with three stars? With fear that I'll be viewed as somewhat prudish, the author over uses sex. Often the sexual references are simply gratuitous. When necessary, i.e., actually a part of the story line, the sex is unnecessarily emphasized."
1,Terrible.,"After hearing so much hoopla about the series I thought I would give it a shot. After forty pages into the first installment of the series I threw it in the trash can. Actually, I sold it to a used bookstore.I can't believe this guy is being compared to Tolkien. There is no comparison here.The dialect was terrible.The storyline was boring.The sex was offensive.End of story."
1,No clear goal.,"We are introduced to a lot of characters, each with their own sub-plot, and you agonize over the ones that you don't care for. Unfortunately the story just gets bogged down with all this stories and all the characters have things going bad for them, none of them have a break. How can each of the main characters threaten the others if things are going sour for them; it makes no sense. After a while you just give up trying to cheer for one of the characters and don't care, all the knights are dumbasses, all the kings are arrogant and idiots, the only smart ones are the dwarf or the enuchs, just not charming at all. Bought the second book but just couldn't stomach it any more."
1,WARNING! Lazy author.,"If you like a story that is unfinished, then this may be the series for you. Read user comments on the last book of this series. The author has lost interest in this story. If you don't mind unfinished stories with seemingly obscure plot direction, so many characters that you have scratch your head and say ""Who is this guy again?"", this series is for you.The author lost control of his story line and now can't come up with decent way to tie it all together for the reader. The signs were there in the time it took the author to come up with the next book.It becomes a rambling, directionless mess toward the end.Avoid it and the author, it will only frustrate most readers."
1,What's the fuss all about?,"There is almost no character development at all and I found the foul language a bit incongruous with the setting of the story. I made it about 1/3 the way through, realized I didn't care a hoot what happened to any of the characters, and then read the end just to see if it got interesting (it didn't). At one point we read about dragons suckling on a human girl, and that's when I decided not to bother at all with the second book in the series, despite already owning it. Martin's work just isn't my taste. I prefer novels where something good happens to at least someone in the book, and less incest and gratuitous sex. For fantasy on the lighter, happier side, try Tad Williams, C.S. Friedman or Martha Wells."
1,OMG!,"Maybe I am too young to read this and cannot acknowledge George R. R. Martin's style of writing others can. I find this book very disorganized and hard to follow. I had to refer to the back of the book several times. Each of the chapters are well written, but he changes the subject just as everything is about to get exciting! He could at least have TWO CHAPTERS on the same person! But no, he just has to keep changing and changing and changing. I absolutely abhor it! It's like getting someone excited only to turn them down at the end. I didn't even bother skimming the book to read the end. There are so many characters and each have their own chapter. This book is like putting numerous stories together! What the other reviewers see in this book I don't know. If you decide to buy this book, brace yourself. For the disgusting parts, the disorganization and switching of stories."
1,Draws you in but doesn't satisfy,"Beware of this book, and the series beyond it! I was drawn in by the richly drawn world and characters that seemed interesting. Although events didn't seem to be unfolding as I had hoped, I kept reading, hoping that something would turn out right in the end. Midway through the third book in the series, I wish I had never started.Basically, the books are no fun to read because the good guys get the stuffing kicked out of them. Several major characters that one has grown fond of die to no purpose, and nobody avenges them. Worse, they die stupidly, from things they should have seen coming. I don't read books like this to end up feeling bad, and I hope you don't either."
5,Tired of clichés?,"The virtuous are not rewarded and the evil are not punished. Trust leads to betrayal sorrow more often than not. These books are the antidote for the sunshine and lollipops you'll find in more typical fantasy fiction. Even so, the plots are so intricate and engrossing, you will not be able to put these down until you have read all of them. I'm only two books into the series and I know there will be a lot of sleepless nights reading to find out how this all turns out."
3,Kindle Edition needs better editors,I read this book in paperback and am now rereading it on Kindle. What a disgrace! There are multiple typos / conversion problems in every chapter (random format changes i.e. italics or bold). Very distracting. Whichever company converted this to Kindle should start over.
3,Transcription needs work,"I've become annoyed enough while reading the story to write a review. Though the story is intriguing and captivating, the numerous errors in the kindle edition makes it an abysmal failure to me. Slogging through mistypes and mispells make me think the transcriber was using a poor text-to-speech software, and liken it to a barely tolerable subtitled foreign film. Great story, bad kindle editors"
5,Incredible 1st book in new series,"Make room on the shelf beside Robert Jordan! For an incredible read check this out! If fantasy is your thing this book is a must. But it transcends the genre like any true great novel does. As complex as Jordan, Rawn, And Wurts, Martin delivers the goods"
4,A great start to rich new series.,"Well-developed and well rounded cast combined with a twisting, turning roller coaster plot makes for a good, though heavy, read. Not for the faint hearted or those who need to reach the end in a hurry. I would rather a book that stood on its own and had a clean conclusion rather than one that will run over multiple thousands of pages."
2,GAME OF THRONES - A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE,"I loved this book. It is fascinating, enthralling and totally well-written.It is a must-read book for those who appreciate great literature.Being a Harry Potter fan, I recommend this book to like-minded bookworms."
3,"Excellent Story...however, read the rest with this in mind","Read the 5 star reviews for what makes this a good book, as I agree with them.However.......#1 - It's much too long, the last three or four chapters are the best in the book, the first 5 are fantastic as well. But the filler in the middle was like the first 15 minutes of a bad movie when you are saying to yourself ""if the plot doesnt show itself in the next 5 minutes I'm not watching the rest"". BUT, plow through it, skimm some if you wish (especially the ""SANSA"" chapters) and you will be rewarded! The feeling that I was left with was there was no overarching main plot line, and there isnt, there are three.#2 - Way to much forced stupidity, the author wants us to beleive that all good people are 90% stupid and slow and only 10% witty and smart. It's forced it seems, and it's insulting to me as a reader. Thats why it only got 3 stars instead of 4.5!"
5,Intriguingly unique,"The families that make up this series are complex. The Starks have a wolf on their banner and the motto ""Winter'sComing."" The Lannisters, who rule, hold the real power. TheQueen's a Lannister. The King isn't but the heir to the throne, Ser Jaime, the ""Kingslayer,"" is. I didn't find it overlymelodramatic. Ned is the Hand of the King. He's the Lord ofWinterfell. When the Starks, Lannisters, and other claimants, start preparing for war, all hell breaks loose. It begins with Ned's oldest daughter breaking off her betrothalto Jaime Lannister. Then spirals downward from there."
2,O.K. But how did this become super popular?,"The writing style is so vague and the characters are so flat! Sure, the plot is interesting, but there really isn't much emotional development or tension. The T.V. series is more interesting than the book, and that being said I didn't even like the T.V. series that much either. I never feel like I properly know any of the characters besides Dani. I wonder if it's because there are SO many viewpoint characters and some of them are boring to read from the heads of. I don't know, but I purchased this book because of the hype and WASN'T impressed."
2,one wild fantasy type story`,"This one wild fantasy type story. I have heard that there is some game evolved from this saga. Wonderful!! I was distressed that the good guys were so apparent and that has led me to feel like I am just waiting for the end to see who is left standing, good or bad.I like that way he setup the story: the characters are given chapters so you can follow their life as it unfolds. The physical world they inhabit is not ours, of course, and there is some magic out there, so later on the magic, like 'Doc Savage,' (who I have never read, only heard about) will make a dramatic entrance and solve everyone's problem and the good guys will win.Ho, hum, but I will read it to the end so I find out who wins, et al."
1,boring,"Not badly written, but I found it boring. The characterizations aren't bad, but nowhere near worthy of the hype this book (and the series) is getting."
4,Definitely some slow parts,"This book definitely has some slow parts, but all-in-all it left me wanting more, as it picks up as the book moves along. If you are a book editor, however, or have the mindset of an editor, you will cringe. He always opts for taking five paragraphs to say what could be said better in five words."
4,A Game of Thrones,"Excellent descriptive book with complicated & full characters. A little violent at times & losing some many good guys regularly is a bit hard but in the circumstances realistic, no soap opera this one"
4,Excellent beginning to a great series!,"This was one of the most engaging books I've read recently. There are a lot of characters, and it takes a while to introduce them, but once they're introduced, things move along at a fast clip. This book is no Lord of the Rings rip-off. There's court intrigue, political machinations, sex, violence, brutality and warfare. It is one of the most realistic fantasy novels I've read in a while, with wonderfully drawn characters and a plot with a lot of twists and turns that keep you reading. Be warned, though, it's not a short, light read, and it took me over 200 pages to truly get into it, hence its not being marked a 5 star book."
5,Excuse me while I detach this hook in my lip....,"Could I be more into this book?!?!?!? I can't wait to read the next one in the series! I love Historical Fiction and this book scratches that itch... but it also unleashed the gendre of Fantasy in my life and I will never be the same again! I am salivating at the mouth for Book Two! Contrary to how it sounds I have a life outside of reading, but I have this story on the brain all the time and read it in snippets when ever I can. Bravo! Encore!"
4,Very good!,"Reasonobly original fantasy. Martin manages to create a compelling world, characters that are intresing and a sytoryline that manages to keep you interesting for the entire book and makes you go looking for the sequal. All in all it is well worth the time spent."
4,"No huge magic, but believable readable characters","A very well told story, easy to read, the 800 pages go by very quickly. Good characters and enough plot lines to keep you interested but not so many that you lose track of what is going on (about 9 separate plot lines). No huge magic involved, but the threat exists for future books. Remember ""Winter is coming"""
5,The best book I've read in years.,"I was a little hesitant to start another huge series (over 800 pages to book ONE), but so far this one is well worth the time and effort - I find myself hoping for at least 3 or 4 more books. The cast of characters is long but manageable and you'll never get tired of any of them. The setting is vast and realistic. There is violence to be sure, but rather than it seeming repulsive, it adds a sense of urgency to the actions of the characters. Our own medieval period was a dangerous time and Martin really captures that sense of danger in book 1. If you like detailed, involved worlds with great characters and large doses of intrigue - you'll love this one."
3,Beware First Edition,"Some if not most of these are not true first editions and do not say ""first edition"" on the copywrite page. They are later printings which to me is not a first edition.I see some sellers are changing their descriptions to reflect this. If you are a collector looking for a true first edition, make sure before you purchase."
4,Great book,I picked of the book after getting hooked on the HBO series. It didn't disappoint. I can't wait to start Clash of the Kings!
5,Perfect book,"In my opinion, this book is a perfectly written masterpiece. Every single detail has a reason and it is just predictable enough to get the adrenaline rushing. The surprises in this book are pretty major and it has one of the best climaxes I have ever experienced. If you are going to buy this and have enough money, buy the whole series. You will not regret it."
4,Excellent Mix,"I bought this book on audible.com not knowing what a success it already was. I love the narrative given by several different characters that is finely woven into a tapestry of a greater story. I understand why the author uses Chaucer-like bawdiness but I still think I could do without it most of the time. However, most readers probably won't be too bothered by it.I now look forward to laundry and other solitary drudgery because it gives me a chance to listen to my book!"
5,page turner,"The house didn't get cleaned for a week! Martin's character development is excellent, the plot is rich, and the layout of the book allows for instant involvement in the story line."
3,A song of ice and fire,This was the best start of a series enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who likes a little fantasy
2,slow,"very slow, too much going back and forth between characters, would not recommend to anyone to read, the book lacks story line"
4,Have to agree with a reviewer below. This isn't fantasy.,"I enjoyed this book a great deal as I enjoy all things medieval, yet this book (and this whole series in fact) is hardly fantasy. I cringe when I read descriptions of this series as ""high fantasy"". High fantasy usually involves elves, dwarves, wizards, gnomes, magic, etc. It's the standard definition of 'high fantasy'. This book has one race. Humans. This book involves an *extremely* small amount of magic. Miniscule. This book has dragons in it that are eggs until the 2nd book and immature and unimportant even in the third book. Dragons may become more prominent in the 4th and 5th books (soon to come). So if you are expecting anything comparable to Tolkien-esque 'high fantasy' (true high fantasy), look for another series. As has been pointed out, this is *slightly* fictionalized medieval history. It's a tale of intrigue and kingdoms and warfare. Fantasy? Hardly. A good read but know what you are getting."
2,It's ok but definitely not for me,"I am one of those that didn't find this book riveting. I was actually bored after the first 200 pages or so. The lengthy descriptions of places, things and people was irritating. There were too many characters to keep up with.I was disappointed by how inept (when it comes to people, tactics and politics) a great warrior as Lord Stark turned out to be, I expected much more from what seemed like a strong character.My reading ends with this book."
3,The Ultimate Setup,"Amazingly, after 720 pages, this is not a complete book! I kid you not. It is merely a long setup for the next book and likely the one after that. As a stand alone read, however, it is mightily disappointing. There is no completion of any of the main story lines. Now I find myself torn, do I read on or cut my losses? I'm leaning towards the latter as there is also a lack of reward to the reader throughout. You will follow character's for chapters on end only to have them die at a moments notice. Or worse, the book ends before the author returns to the character or storyline. And the author spends endless pages describing past histories of so and so this and so and so that. It's all a bit tedious and makes for one frustrating read. All that said, it has it upside too. Generally well written. Some characters are well developed and interesting. And parts of it are engaging. Like I wrote previously, I'm truly torn!"
2,"Okay, but I wish I had saved my money.","It's not a bad book but it's not a great book. Like some of the other reviewers I agree, that I was less than satisfied with the turn of events. I also agree Martin has a little too much sex in the book, and describes it like some badly written romance novel."
4,"Great book, rather large","My only problem with this books is the physical size of the book. It is much larger than I expected, and I don't mean length of book/pages. I mean the literal size of the book. It is a bit awkward to hold because it is rather long. Other than that, it was good quality."
4,Game of Thrones,Great plot. I find there are a lot of characters with very difficult names so am having a bit of trouble keeping them all straight.I like the way the author has headed each chapter with a character name and advances the story through them. I would recommend this book especially to very dedicated readers who have the time to sort out all the threads of this story line.
2,"Glacial pace, definitely not a page turner","I have now read the whole series to date over the last week or so, based on the recommendation of a friend, and I cannot believe I wasted all that time. I kept hoping, in disbelief, that the story would somehow move forward. About 75% of the narrative is plodding, unnecessary dialogue that adds nothing to the story. Martin keeps adding more and more characters until by the fifth book there is something like 500 different characters and 50+ different sub-plots. Just when you become interested and invested in a character's story, Martin moves on and you are lucky to see that character for another 2,000 pages (e.g. Bran, Arya, etc). Apparently, this is going to be another Robert Jordan Wheel of Time type series that will take 20 years to wrap up. I will not be continuing on with the series."
3,"Great TV Show, Not such a great book","If you're a real reader, this is a biit dry. Remarkable narrative written fairly poorly. I came to this from the TV series which I loved. I got about half way through this before I decided to rewatch the first two series and be patient for the third..."
3,I used this to figure out who everyone is,"It doesn't exactly line up with the TV series, but it was very helpful to me in getting a handle on who is who, the family connections, and the back story on what's going on."
3,Okay,"While not a bad book by any means, the further I read into this book and its sequel, the more disappointed I became. What starts out a political drama slowly includes more and more bits of magic. I've read Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. I've nothing against the inclusion of magic in fictional worlds. It just feels out of place in part because none of the characters early on appear to have any acquaintance or belief in it. Magic just seems to appear, as if from nowhere. And, when its used, it seems un-necessarily grotesque and, well, overly convenient.The whole series of seven books feels much longer than it needs, and some of the plot makes me wonder if the author made decisions while playing a long and bizarre D&D; campaign."
4,love it but,"an awsome book love the caracter ,the stori line ,is great the onli bad thing is to keep up whit all the caracter and there point of view"
3,Well done,"This is a well written work of Epic fantasy that I enjoyed very much. I have yet to move on to the second and third installments, but I plan to. I know some will complain about this and that, but overall I think its a tribute to the genre."
5,Epic Fantasy with a dark twist,"The book creates a believable imaginary world in which palace intrigue is a fixture of life, and impending doom threatens from the north. Even the horse kingdom seems so much like what one imagines life with Ghengis Khan would have been like, that the birth of dragons in a fit of dark magic seems comprehensible. I can't wait to read the next volume of the series and find out what people are so frightened about when they whisper ""Winter is coming!"""
5,Haunting and special and brilliant and...,"Contains scenes that have left me at times breathless, with tears in my eyes and a smile on my face, and at times ""scourged"" (to use one of the author's favorite verbs). I find myself rereading passages and pages in amazement. Gritty, shocking and wonderful! The best I've read in a long, long time. Thank you Mr. Martin!"
5,Amazing read!,"This is the most enjoyable fantasy book that I've ever read. The characters have such a realness, yet Martin makes them sneaky and intriguing. With the wide array of characters, you're bound to find one that you'll fall in love with. Also, the plot and everything is so well planned out. Martin is obviously a genius to create such a world. A must read for anybody. Hell, I got my ex-girlfriend who reads Danielle Steele to fall in love with the series. Now that's an accomplishment!"
4,A good start...,"The story was good enough to leave me wanting more! Even though it is a long book and Martin plans for several more books in the storyline, there are enough subplots to keep one interested. Needs a bit of editorial work, though, but not so much that it detracts from the high quality of the book. This is a book for someone with patience, because it is not an ""easy"" read by any means!"
2,"Blah, blah, blah","Poorly written, puerile, and formulaic. Within the first page, Martin displays all his weaknesses. Perhaps it gets better as one goes along, but Martin handles exposition so poorly that one becomes tired of his hamhanded efforts to introduce characters and backstory. The world he populates resembles a thinly developed D&D game from 1984, and the characters are the sort of adolescent cartoons that poorly-educated fantasy buffs probably think of as ""complex"", when they are in fact amorphous blobs of fatal contradiction. A very silly book from an author who knows the gimmick of marketing crudity as subtlety."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I rushed out and bought this book after reading the reviews on this site only to be very disappointed. A novel is meant to be about somebody and something. This book changes viewpoint so frequently between a cast of unsympathetic or shallow characters that I could not relate to any of them.Though Martin's writing is well above average for the genre (except for the POV changes), this story is like watching a movie through a strobe light. For mine, Robert Martin's 'shades of grey' book just created a grey cheerless book. If he'd have written the story, as good novels do, with at least 70-80% of the story through a single character it might have salvaged the novel. I certainly won't be tracking down book 2.If you're new to fantasy, stick with Tolkien, early Fiest and Eddings, and Tad William's Dragonbone chair series. Newer authors like Martin and Erikson write unsympathetic characters and the less said about Robert Jordan's never ending story the better."
1,Disappointing fantasy,"Book four was terrible. The last book (thank goodness) was worse. He leaves us with all the heros dead, no conclusions to any issues, Dannery wandering who knows where with her Dragon, the other two dragons gone where? No conclusions on the trials of Cersie, no resolution of the fight with the wights at the wall. It is as if he just ran out of energy and said ""lets stop now"". I will not read him again."
2,"Sad, cardboard, derivative and trite","I'd read a few of Martin's short stories. He was hit and miss, but was interesting enough that I decided to try this famous series. What a mistake that turned out to be.I struggled to finish the book. The characters are pure cardboard and could be taken from a junior high school kid's first concept of what good and evil should be. There was no surprise in any of their actions, the plotting was plodding and standard, and it just wasn't interesting.Ok, no quite uninteresting. The two stories of Jon Snow and Dany, with the Wall and the mongol clones were passably interesting, which is what kept the book from being completely useless."
2,Hard to read past author's hatred of women,"The writing was good, the story intriguing, but I constantly stumbled over the author's clear hatred of women.I won't go into the inability to finish or even provide good background for any of the 8 story lines going on, it is, after all meant to be a series. What I found hard to read past was the underlying disrespect, hatred and contempt for women. There are no less than 8 rape scenes, including a whole culture where rape is an accepted means of procreation. Leave aside the incest, (you are suppose to hate those characters) even one of the heroes commits child molestation and rape.So let's set all that aside and consider that every woman in the cast of characters is portrayed as either conniving and vindictive, insane, weak or painfully foolish, except the little girl masquerading as a boy.Don't know what is going on in the author's life to make him hate women so, but it makes it difficult to read about the world of his creation."
5,A great and truly fantastic tale.,"A Game of Thrones is the finest that fantasy fiction has to offer. Too often, fantasy authors expell their energies trying to make their fantasy world ""realistic."" Well, Martin definately accomlpishes this, but in a different way. Martin makes his world believable not only through historical background and detail, but also through the people who populate it. Any world is little more than the sum total of the people and creatures who inhabit it. The plot Martin weaves through the first volume in this series is incredibly well thought out. Lovers of romance, fantasy, and historical fiction will all find something within these pages to satisfy them. While comparisons to Tolkien and more contemporary authors (like Jordan) are inevitable, Martin has truly created a work of fantasy magic unlike any heretofore. I highly recommend this book. . .the finest fantasy novel since the Silmarillion."
5,A must read!,"All I can say is that this is the best newbook of the year. Now that its out in paperback,there is absolutely no reason not to read it.This book is as good or better than anythingRobert Jordan has written, which is saying A LOT!If you only buy one book this year,this is it."
5,George Martin is a Rock Star,"If you like castles, knights and a good medieval adventure, this book is for you. One of the best I've ever read. The whole series is spectacular. Great, believable characters, real life situations, beautiful descriptions of the world Martin has created, historic details...I've read the whole series three times. I'll read them as long as he writes them. Lord of the Rings caliber writing, without copying a single element."
2,gormeghast revisited,I am reading with a nagging feeling I know this. Nothing is new. The Gormeghast trilogy same feel same gloom.
5,"Here's five more stars, Mr. Martin","This book has already gotten so many five star reviews, and so many of those both well and thoughtfully written, that I'm not going to go on at length about the many reasons I enjoyed ""A Game of Thrones"". But I did enjoy it, and I think it's worth a few minutes out of my day to say thanks to George R.R. Martin for a truly excellent book. If you're at all on the fence about reading ""A Game of Thrones,"" don't be. Read and enjoy. Thanks, George."
1,Unnecessarily Sexual,"I made it 6 chapters into this book before I put it down. I get that sex is part of the human experience, but I don't personally need an author to paint softcore pornography in my head to get the idea. This book is thick with overly descriptive sexual encounters that are unnecessary to the core plot."
1,Meh.,"After being told just how great the series is by several people and reading all the glowing reviews, I started reading this book. What a disappointment! The whole thing was just an endless soap opera of cliched, flat characters in a story that doesn't go anywhere. Now I'm being told that the next book is better, really! I think I'll explore the shelves for something with more varied characterization and a world that isn't an obvious cut-n-paste job."
4,Mis-labeled,"After just two chapters I realized that this series is mis-labeled as a children's book. From the language and content, at the very least it should be removed from that category and placed under young adult."
4,Wow,"This book is exciting, imaginative and well written. I suggest watching thevTV series after reading the book. I see this having a cult following. Makes for great conversation as the TV series has make the book even more popular."
5,highly recommend reading this book,"the character devolpment is really good , the plot is complex and unpredictable the time period feels like the 15th century , the writing is clear , and well done"
4,Plenty of political intrigue,"I enjoyed this book because it delves deeply into a plot driven by political intrigue. The character development was exceptional. Martin is an excellent writer and he paints a very vivid picture of every aspect of his mythical world. I would have enjoyed more battles and action in the book, however I imagine he is working up to that in the upcoming novels. This may be a challenging read for individuals who prefer a faster paced novel, however I found it quite rewarding. I have purchased Clash of Kings and am looking forward to reading it.Note: This book features vivid sexual content, including depictions of violent rape. Parents or individuals sensitive to such materials should consider this prior to reading."
4,Just like the TV shos,"OK, so here's the deal, if you liked the TV show (which I did, a lot!), you'll like the book... cuz it is virtually identical.Love 'em both!!"
3,Game of Thrones,This rating was made because this is a very long story and is somewhat boring in sections. Will pass on any sequel.
4,good story line,I loved the story line. It kept me reading past the time I should have quit. I did not like the sexual references--some were way too graphic.
5,"Fantasy, Politics and Intrigue","This book is not only one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read, but also one of the books I've ever read -- period. George Martin creates a richly detailed world where characters act out political and military dramas against an elaborate historical tradition. Martin weaves an intricate plot through several major characters, yet manages to give each character a unique and independent voice.I highly recommend this novel to anyone with an interest in fantasy, medeival history, or political drama. You won't be disappointed."
5,EXCELLENT,"The odd thing about a lot of fantasy novels is that the ideas of what makes a good story do not consists of any really new ideas. The problem is trying to make them work. Game of Thrones creates a fantasy world that is full of mystery, action, intrigue, and suspense that is just plain fun to read. So many stories always have magical elements that sometimes seem to get too godlike or omnipotent at the cost of coherence. (maybe that's why it's magic eh?) Finally! It is refreshing to see a story that has magic as a strong part of the story but in a much more subtle way. No wizards blasting away at each other, but the characters all know and fear magic as something completely unknown. In short magic is actually mysterious and well, magical. Combine this with a chessgame of a story and I see an excellent series. Can't wait to read more."
5,breathtaking,"I will keep it short, I have read a lot of books, but this was the only boo that stopped from doing anything than reading it, during classes, during dinner etc. I almost forgot to breath. And it says a lot, because i am bored very quick... I loved the way it slowly became clear what the links between the different stories and persons are. And finally a book with strong female figures... I can't express how frustrated and dissappointed I was when I raced to the bookstore to find out I had to wait over a year for the release of the second book.. George, hurry!"
4,Too many critics here have an inappropriate moral stance!,"There are certainly a number of reasons that one could criticize these books, but reading through the one star reviews, I get the sense that some bible-belt wacko book burners all got together to flood these reviews with trollfood. Please take your morality somewhere else - inflict it on your children if you must, but I am an adult and I enjoyed the scene where Eddard Stark takes the head of a deserter in front of his 8 yr old son in the name of honor. That is good fantasy. Criticizing the books from your pseudo-christian perspective betrays the value of a public rating system and the spirit of literary critique.Imagine how poor our literary history would be if all books had been judged against a christian ethic. This is exactly why we don't want your religion in our schools or government."
3,Never-ending Story,"Let this be a warning - Before you start this book, ask yourself if you want to get engrossed in a story which never is finished - where nothing is ever finally resolved. I have read 4 of these so far, and am engrossed with the series but increasingly frustrated with the lack of resolution. I suspect that Martin may die before he ever finishes - and I believe an unfinished tale is pretty much a waste of time.The writing, the plot, and the characters are all good and well-developed, although the levels of violence and cruelty are out of hand, and you get tired of seeing the best and the brightest of characters die, become cruelly maimed and disfigured, or be corrupted.As I said before, the series is engrossing, so if you read this one, you will most likely want to read the next six as well (of which only 3 are completed). If you're like me, you will also be frustrated by the lack of progress and resolution (Ice & Fire is starting to look like Wheel of Time in that regard)."
5,Game of Thrones,"Brilliant read, addictive. Better than the TV series and the series is very good. Have advised all my friends to try it out. Might not be for everyone but I found I was looking forward to reading it every evening."
4,take care,"Of this Martin series, though the first book is fantastic, the following books sequentially bog down into the mire of futility, the hopeless rut of destructive repetition.Martin should take care that Chinese pirating merchants don't produce/sell a reproduction with meaningful plot given a better job reaching climaxes substituting ""copies"" from Book Two onward for reader satisfaction. Cut to the chase, Martin. Rewrite your series into a simple trilogy. There are solid structural reasons for the classical success of trilogies that Martin has chosen to ignore in his overgrown vine of a story, peddling pages without end. tsk, squandering talent."
5,A surprising whim.,"I had been given a border's books and music gift card by my father and I planned to use it to buy some new books. Well, I was browsing the book store and happened upon a ""Clash of Kings"" which as we all know is the second book in the trilogy. After picking it up and reading the front page, I noticed there was a first book. I found the first book and bought them both, based mainly on the reviews on the book. I must say I am ASTOUNDED at how well George Martin writes. The man has the ability to surprise you, keep you in suspense and even draw you so deep into the storyline that you dream about being there in the ice, running from the Others and hiding from the Lannisters. Good show."
1,An ode to despicable people,"I only made it about 2/3rds through the book before I just couldn't stand reading about these horrible characters anymore. I have never read a book with such a despicable caste of characters. The characters who weren't evil were just so ignorant that I despised them equally. I actually liked the writing and the plot generally, but just can't spend another minute reading about these horrible people."
2,shallow,I found the work to be vulgar and mellowdramatic. Characters had no substance and very little personality. It is nothing that I could not have found in the impulse-buy section at the supermarket. I will not read another and try to forget I was conned into wasting my time on this.
5,"Gah, don't read this book!","If you want to enjoy other books... because you'll raise your standard on quality books after reading A song of Ice and Fire.I was a very avid reader, reading on average 2 books a week. But once i finished A song of Ice and Fire, i just found it hard completing any other books. I even went back to my old favorites such as The Dragonlance Chronicles and Wheel of Time, but they all seemed so childish after reading Martin's works.Simply the best writing i've ever read."
1,Days of Our Lives... with Swords...,"First time I was ever MAD after finishing a book. Read all five, and I have only one question... ENDING? If I had wanted to read a soap opera I would have found one on some network on cable. I want a refund, and some one owes me about three weeks of reading time. Save yourself, read something more satisfying... like a comic book...That is what this is... A Soap Opera with swords."
1,Inane and unimaginative,"This book is written at the level of the young adult, yet lacks flow and originality. One quickly tires of the self-important over-written prose, and the back and forth between characters' points of view in each chapter. These are flat characters whose behavior is predictable and driven only by highly contrived and barely credible events.Moreover, much of the novel is derivative, ""borrowing"" from other books which eclipse it entirely. Don't bother reading this book."
3,Far Too Long,"Martin's writing is excellent, as are his characters. But I just can't get into a book with all the padding a lengthy series requires. Some people just eat it up, though. So, if really long series are your thing, then this is probably right up your alley. But if you prefer book size books, then there's nothing here with enough originality to really suck you in."
2,Just not my genre,"I started this book because I know lots of people who loved it. I have no issue with the writing, I just don't like the genre."
4,Good reading for followers of the TV program,Although I have watched almost of the HBO shows to date I was still unclear on some of the relationshiips and other details and reading the book clarified things and now I'm even more eager for the new shows to air.
2,"Low on action, and the story develops too slowly.","The idea of the story is good, but the execution is lacking. When something interesting comes up I am switched to another character, and not many of them are that interesting. I like the guy who is trying to regain ""his"" kingdom. Actually I wanted him to die, but that is the hallmark of a good villain. The bastard son is and his pet are interesting also. The rest of the characters could have died, and I would not have cared. The idea of switching character perspective seems like a good idea, but there is no lead off into the next person's PoV unlike a traditional book where one chapter leads into the next one. Reading the book is like talking to someone who just randomly switches topics mid-sentence without any warning."
5,First Fantasy Book,"I just started reading this series at the beginning of the year. A Game of Thrones was my first book ever in the fantasy genre.This book was phenomenal and a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. Although, there are a ton of characters, there is someone for everyone to root for. A great bunch of story lines. All I can say is, I'm hooked and I bought the second book, A Clash of Kings and love that one too.Definitely check it out!!!"
4,Game of Thrones,Good story. Lots of characters to keep track of Which made it a bit hard going. Still a very good read
5,A Game of Thornes,"It was a great book like the second book anf the third. alot of jumping from one King, children and Knights"
2,Too many Points of View,"1) I rated this book base on the face value of Amazon's rating system. I didn't like it so 2 stars.2) Martin has Joss Whedon disease. He has too damned many POV characters and this makes the book disjointed and fractious. On top of that, only 1 character in the whole book is actually interesting. The rest are just loud.3) It's BORING. Tedious to read. Just when you start getting into a scene, Martin switches point of view and throws you out of whack. And all the politics is just oppressive. I keep wanting to scream at the book ""Just kill someone and get it over with!""4) Too many of the characters are unappealing. They simply aren't relatable. Beyond the dwarf and the bastard, there isn't a character in the book that I can bring myself to care about in any way. And the bastard is too whiny to be likable."
3,"GREAT BOOK, BAD KINDLE VERSION","This book was great, I am definitely enjoying it. HOWEVER, the Kindle edition has so many typos and errors that I have to wonder if they placed them on purpose to locate stolen copies later down the line. Seriously, I couldn't read a page without finding a typo. If you can get past the typos, this book is a great read, but be aware there are these problems."
3,Everyone loves this book - except me!,"The beginning of the book is fantastic. But, I soon found I was bogged down in one more novel with far too many characters, shifts in viewpoint, and unnecessary plot elements. The beginning sets you up to expect more magic than the rest of the book delivers."
2,Way too long but good,I would have given this book 4-5 stars if Martin would have been able to condense his stories. His books are way too long in length. I enjoyed this book so I purchased his next 2 books in this series. Martin needs to take a lesson from Tolkien and learn how to write a book that is manageable to read. I quit reading the second book about 800 pages in when I realized there was still over 500 pages to read.
5,Loved it,I bought this book based on all the positive reviews. I am so glad that I did. Every free moment I have was dedicated to this book and it was so hard to put down! I can't wait to read the next one!!
5,"Amazing, woderfully written.","I have read all five of the books, I love it! Game of Thrones is the best of all the books. Its a bit dark, but its good. I love how you see each person perspective and opinions. If you love a good read, this is the book for you.Summer lasts for years and winter last for generations. four families fight for the iron throne. Stark, Lanister, Baratheon, and Targaryan. I love Arya and Dany. And Needle.Get this book!!!"
2,well written yet un-engaging,"I read this book with much anticipation because I read and heard so many great reviews. Very disappointed. I agree that the book is rich and very well written. However, there is not a single likable character in the book! It's just not fun to read when you don't care about any of the characters."
1,NOTHING like Tolkien,"I had read that the author was the American Tolkien, so I bought the audio book, looking forward to becoming immersed in another world. This comparison couldn't be further from the truth. Tolkien's writing captures the wonder, magic, and beauty of people and the world. Tolkien's descriptive prose fills your minds with images; his people and the world are multifaceted. In Martin's book, people are concerned with one thing: power over each other. There's nothing but mean people being mean to each other and teaching the naive how to be mean. The only magic is dark; there is no wonder; there is no careful description of the world or people to draw you into its reality.Bottom line: if you're thinking about this book because you're a Tolkien fan, skip it."
2,Don't bother if you are over 13....,Poor character development and plodding plot. The author brings in interesting events (like the dire wolf discovery) and never really develops them in time to keep you interested. Female characters especially are poorly done. Yuck!
2,A Game of Chapters,"I'll admit that Martin can weave a tale.. But `twas like standing next to a drunken man forgetting which story he was telling.. ""Jon Snow was sent to the wall..."" Gulp. ""Where was I... A Lady Stark was a woman, a fine one.."" Gulp ""Lannister, ah, yes, was small fellow, midgets tend to be that way."" Gulp... Add ten or more characters all main characters. He should have taken a few, like Jon Snow and told a tale and not a bit of this and a bit of that. With the future girth of his books to come I certainly appreciate books like Reichert's The Legend of Nightfall... One book can tell it all. Although a don't like her epic work either..."
5,How could you not enjoy this book?,"I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book. WOW! So original. It's unlike anything I have ever read and I couldn't put it down. The thing I loved most about this book is how engaging each charater was. I loved them all, even the ones you are supposed to hate."
4,amzing Boom,"I thought this book was amazing. The level of detail that Martin uses to describe things is wonderful. The only problem I had with it was that it dragged on from time to time. Other than that, the continuity was great. With jumping back and forth from different character's view points, I thought there were going to be a few issues, but the story flowed seamlessly. I can't wait to get through the other books."
5,Bought It After Watching it on HBO,"As usual, the book is much better. I had never heard of George R.R. Martin before seeing the series on television. If you enjoy fantasy, you'll love this one."
5,cant put this book down,My wife read these books first and I didn't think that I would like them. Couldn't be more wrong. I can't put them down.
4,Very good book. I recommend.,Great author. Easy to read. Very good story. This is my first book reading in kindle app. I loved it.
5,The Best Modern Fantasy Book...Period,"This book is undoubtedly the best I have ever read.It is full of rich detail and description, making the world and characters feel full and alive and above all...real. The characters are as human and vulnerable as I have ever encountered in fantasy literature, and Martin really has you caring about them as if you knew them in real life.Tyrion Lannister is one of the most brilliant characters I have ever read about, and throughout the book you build up a love of Eddard Stark and his family and friends (Like Hodor, a character who makes me laugh every time he speaks).Brilliant, realistic, brutal, emotionally charged and involving. I think even people who don't generally care for fantasy books would love this book."
5,Hooked,"A story too good to resist! This is a captivating read that pulls you into the world of kings, queens, lords, mystical creatures, Others, dragons and much more. I am getting ready to start the next one... now."
3,starts slow,"i like this series and am in the process of rereading it. Each novel starts a little slow but by the end leaves you ready for the next. All in all it is worth reading, but I wouldn't rank it amoung my favorites."
5,Amazing read!!!,This book is simply amazing. I love the way the author tells the story and the way it is inlaid. If you are interested in fantasy at all along with a great view of old lore then this book is for you!!! Can't wait to start reading the next book which I am downloading now!!!
2,Realistic,"Cosidering the large amount of fantasy writers out there...You don't have to read anything but the very best. So when I saw the high ratings George R.R. Martin was getting I thought it would be worth my time...I was wrong. To be honest...It just sucked. If I want to read about politics I'll grab a newspaper and read the real thing. I have to give George credit, he was brave with his story telling. He wasn't afraid to kill anyone. But the characters were just pawns in some schemer's plot...so whomever dies in the story was meant to die. I wasn't surprised at all...just think of all the things that could go wrong realistically...and they go wrong... If you are looking for a character that rises above his/her negative heritage and becomes greater...then don't look in this series. Its really just there to be unpredictable...which is good. If you wait for the plot to become intense...you might be waiting for a while. Because you are reading fictional history. Not a epic heroic novel."
5,You're a cruel man George!,"At one point in reading this series I slowly closed the book, put it aside, and sat in stunned silence for ten minutes. I just couldn't believe it. How could Martin do this to the characters I've come to know so well? I really didn't think I could go on reading, but of course I did.I could almost hear Martin chuckling at my reaction. You can tell that he enjoys taking every preconcieved notion and expectation of where you think the story is going and giving you a sharp slap in the face to dispell your naivety. He builds the story along lines that you think you've seen before, building suspense and your hopes, then smashes them to bits. (To those who've read it, don't you feel like Sansa sometimes?)If you'd like something different, if you want to be shocked and heartbroken, and have a great time too, read this series by George Martin."
5,I was entranced.,"I was browsing through the fantasy section and I picked this book out by chance. I had never heard of George R.R. Martin before so I said what the heck, I will give him a chance. I am so grateful that I did. The book was incredible. There were cerain passes in the book where I just got shivers up my spine. I am trying to do whatever I can to pass my time until the A Clash of Kings comes out. It seems that everything I read now just doesn't compare."
5,Exceptional Book,"After watching the HBO season 1 of Game of Thrones I decided to see how the book was. I loved the book, while this doesn't contain a tremendous number of battles the pot line is great. Definitely worth reading if you enjoyed the HBO series, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book even though I knew the storyline from the HBO series. I'm not typically into fantasy type books or shows, but this book and series for that matter are great."
5,Definitly a must read.,"I'm a big fan of David Eddings, and just happened upon this book by chance, so I told myself, what the heck, it's not Eddings but oh well, lets give it a shot. After the first 10 pages or so, I found it impossible to put down. Its subtlties are outstanding and The plot changes so quickly that I was caught off guard several times. Martin's work is the most tremendous account of ""the game of thrones"" that I have ever read. Unbelievable, good guys can actually die. I am impatiently waiting for the next book in the series."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I love epic fantasy, yet I'd never picked up this series...because the covers are so boring. Pathetic, I know. But you know what? In this case, turns out I did judge the book pretty well by the cover.This book just did not do it for me. Too much court intrigue, too little action. Way too many characters to keep track of, and nary a one that I came to care about much. I didn't find the writing to be very good, either. Martin's descriptions were more confusing that illuminating, and he could take a lesson from Tad Williams when it comes to metaphor and imagery.I also can't understand why Martin includes so much graphic sexual content in the book. To make it more ""realistic""? Dude, you're writing a FANTASY series. It wouldn't bother me, but I know this genre is very popular amoung middle and high school students. Not sure if I'd want my kid reading about rape, incest, oral sex, etc."
1,disappointed,"After all the hype online and on TV with the new series, I was really looking forward to this book. However, I found it tedious and boring. There are intriguing chapters, but the plot was fairly predictable before I was halfway done. Too many characters lead to underdeveloped characters. Yes, girls did get married at 13, but reading some of these scenes felt....dirty even if it may have been historically accurate. The gap b/t the young playing at war and the adults living through it was too large a gap to bridge for me. Knowing the story continues on and on through more books made me tired just thinking of it."
5,Great Start,"One of the best fantasy series going. Martin has a gift for dialogue and draws fascinating characters. He's particularly strong with the intrigue elements as they play out between political enemies. There's little doubt this will be one of the series for the ages.There's only occassionally the false note, and it's often so slight that you hardly notice. I'd probably give this 4.5 stars if Amazon had such an option.The magic is underplayed. It's not a problem, but it's an interesting choice for a fantasy novel. But I love the voices of the characters. Truly compelling!"
5,Fantasy Novel of the Year???? Absolutely!!!!!!!,"Move over Tad Williams - Tolkien has a new heir to the Throne. This book has DEPTH. Not since Tolkien's Middle Earth has a world been so fully realized. Here is a story that lingers, haunting the reader long after the last page is turned."
1,Watch the show,"Don't bother reading the book, just watch the show. I found the author's use of the English language irksome. The plot isn't particularly bad, but the writing style for the more sophisticated reader is distracting."
1,Read this,People really need to know that just because something is realistic doesnt mean its good. There is a reason for LOTR and othe FAKE fantasy books that were a lot more entertanig than this. This easliy consumed hours of my life that i will never get back. And dont get me started on the typos. And the reason it took hours is because Martin added pointless detail after pointless deatail. This book fails at being real too otherwise life would be very depressing.
4,Good Book,"I haven't read for pleasure in quite some time, and this was the book I decided to do it with. I saw the first season on HBO first, and that is why I decided to read the book too. Just like any book when compared to the movie/TV it is nice to see many of the holes left in the movie being filled in by the book. I had a hard time with the many new titles and terms brought up in the book, but imagine that is normal with this type of genre."
1,it will never finish,"It has taken 6 years for an announcement of the Book 5 dance with Dragons release. Book 4 was abysmal, so my advice is to not start the series."
2,XXX fantasy- Not for the kids,"There are a lot of people warning that this book is a little disturbing or graphic and some people have labelled it R. I think that is FAR to generous. This book should not be sold to anyone under 18. The scenes of graphic sex are more shocking and sick than penthouse letters. For example the graphic description of sex with an under-aged pregnant girl covered in horse blood really beg the question ""was this necessary""?The only reason this was not labelled a romance novel is that the sex, while gruesomely graphic, is not fun, sexy, or romantic.In My Opinion, A fantastic, complex story that was needlessly dragged into the gutter by sadistically graphic tripe. If you can look past, or better yet, skip over these parts there is a very good story in there. But it is not the great fiction masterpiece that everyone is hailing it. A great masterpiece can be enjoyed at any age, this book cannot."
1,"TOO dark, and sexually explicit","Robert Jordan writes some harsh stuff - but he has some light in his world. There is no nobility in this fictional world. This is not ""realism"". This book seeks to bring forth only the vile, base, and viscious - added is the VERY explicit sex scenes. I ordered book 1 and 2 on a whim (a mistake I'll not make again). I read some of book 2 as it came in first until I couldn't take any more (about 1/3). It was even worse! I skimmed book one and found the same when it finally came in. There's better fiction out there that won't stoop to ""base vulgarity"" and all that is course and vile to paint the moods."
2,Long winded and overrated,"Read many fantasy books. this is too long, too descriptive. i'm bored. Goodkind so much better."
2,Target Audience - Tweens,"This book was very well written but I am clearly not a member of the target audience. Game of Thrones read like a Soap Opera. Perhaps, the fact that over 1,000 gave this book 5 stars should have tipped me off. It is back to something a bit more toothy; like, Erikson's Malazon Book of the Fallen..."
5,"A wonderful book of plots, twists and turns","There are numerous reviews about this book and its accompanying series. The reason there are so many is because this book is a classic. It is one of those rare books that takes you ""every which way but loose."" It's plots are intricate and no character is safe. You are finally left expecting the unexpected and even then he spins your heels around. The series is smartly written and never boring. You won't regret this one."
5,"""Game of Thrones"" a Winner","George R.R. Martin's ""Game of Thrones"" brought me back to the fantasy aisle after a few years of boredom with the genre. Rather than the industry standard coming-of-age or stop-the-evil-wizard story, this novel winds through the intrigues of several noble families as they all grasp for the throne of a kingdom united only by fear of perils to the north. Martin has developed each of the several principal characters into unmistakable individuals without cheapening them with caricature. I'm a bit more than halfway through this exciting read, and I have no idea how it will turn out!"
4,Excellent Beginning,"I got off to a slow start with this book, but then I am used to the epics by Terry Goodkind or Robert Jordan. I trudged through this book, and started to realy enjoy myself after about 100 pages. This author is extremely thurough in approaching a political conflict between powerful families, and just as insightful when writing the conflicting emotions every person feels when faced with decisions that can have a life and realm altering affect. The next book in this series get even better... and this is one author out of all that I have read that truley understands the concept of a series. The first book, setting the scene, the second pulling you into the story, and choosing side ... the the third almost peaking to the climax of the story. Almost like a good song. If you are a fan of epic fantsy, then Martin is a 'must buy'"
1,This is Pop Fantasy,"""Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his [...].""If the line above makes you grimace for reasons other than the obvious than do not buy this book. I can only assume it is consistent with the quality of writing you'll find throughout since I couldn't make it past the first two hundred or so pages. Martin wields his pen like a sledgehammer.Also, if descriptive sex between Genghis Khan and his thirteen-year-old bride makes you a little uncomfortable you may want to consider something else. I accept the reality of child brides in this setting, but couldn't Martin have just alluded to the fact that the marriage was consummated and the groom was surprisingly gentle?"
1,Complete waste of time and money,"The first few pages are great, then the story stalls. I couldn't even finish it because it bored me to tears. I kept waiting for there to be some sort of action but it NEVER happens even more than halfway through the book. Maybe the end is great, but I'll never know because I can bare how slow it moves."
1,Fantasy? Maybe technically.,"I read this book followed by the second and about half of the third (before being too revolted to continue) and I have to say I'm surprised by the rave reviews. This isn't a fantasy book, its more akin to horror than anything else. The series became predictable in its own way. A disaster will happen. Every character will end up mangled, mauled, and mistreated without fail. Just like the hero that always saves the day, in this series, life will always get worse. Maybe this book is popular because gore, violence, and sex have become so popular in the modern world. I don't know. As for me though, since attempting to read this series, I haven't picked up a single new fantasy book. I used to like fantasy, but if this is ""good"" fantasy, then I'd rather stick to something more cheerful, like cyberpunk."
4,A taste of good fantasy for the not-so-really fan,"I'm not a true-blue fantasy fan. But I've read Tolkien, Lewis, Jones, etc. George RR Martin's book series, I'm sure to many, are one of many of their kind. Reading the first book of this series (even before the HBO version) made me realize that I can easily handle fantasy (specially those set in otherworldly medieval kingdoms) and that people like me can completely relate to the drama and the joys of a good, engaging story.It's funny to read comments from ""haters"" of these books. Maybe they should play the game version or watch the HBO series first then try plunging back into reading the books. An appreciation of the storytelling might be redeemed."
5,A Genre Of Its Own,"I read this series seven years ago while waiting for Guy Gavriel Kay to write another book. My local librarian recommended it after I said I wasn't really into fantasy except for Kay. I'm not a fan of space ships and alternate universes. And that's exactly why I couldn't put down GRRM's books. If you're thinking about reading this because you've been watching HBO then be assured that so far the HBO production is fairly true to the book although of course not as good. The problem however is that when the HBO show is over, you'll be left essentially having seen one seventh of the story. So go ahead, buy the Kindle version. It is much easier to hold than the book. But better warn your family that you're unavailable for the next three days."
3,Ho hum!,"Even though I new I was beginning a series I was still hoping after reading 800 pages that there would be a few resolutions. Not a complete continuation of every story line. With that out of the way, it was a well written and thought out book. Loved the character created and the flow of the different stories as they intermingled."
4,A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire:Book one,I liked this book very much. It takes a little patience as the characters develop but the plot starts right up. I am on book three right now. There is action and some of the descriptions are pretty graphic but probably accurately reflects the times.
1,Boring,This book series is as boring as it gets. The storyline just plods along following uninteresting characters that do nothing worth noting besides having incest. The Elaine storyline from the Wheel of Time holds my attention better than this crap.Do yourself a favor and don't start it.
4,Like very much,"Maybe it's a five but the character jumping is distracting. Perhaps I shouldn't have watched the series first. The series so far, I think, is very close to the book. Will I have the fortitude to read the entire series? I don't know."
2,Movie script,"The whole book reads like movie script - I just got through 25% of it, trying to understand what is the hype. The chapters are broken up like they are made for a movie, go here do that, say that, then go there. There is no flow and there is no emtional flow . It is mostly just the plot. So to speak the book is all bones, without the flesh.And I am not liking all the violence too. Isn't fantasy supposed to be about good vs. evil . Well, in this book where is the good? The good gets you killed. If I wanted the real ugly life story I could just turn on CNN.To even compare it to the "" Lord of the Rings"" is a travesty. I should get a refund."
3,Chicago and North Western Passenger Cars,"A bit disappointing as the book does not have a detail roster. Many b&w photos of passenger equipment. One section with color photos. Photos are nearly all broadside of various cars. No attempt to cover all classes of equipment owned by C&NW. Rather the photos respresent cars from each type, headend, coach, dining and sleeping. Mostly photo captions with little text. However, it does serve a purpose as a companion book to Dorin's book on postwar C&NW passenger service. Both books complement each other and make up for what each one lacks. Recommend that both books be purchased as a set."
2,Disappointing,"Expected more from this. It's more like pamphlet of scanned pages of original book. Although a good story, save your money if you are looking for a nice Airedale story. Not what I hoped for. Delivery was quick and 'book' was new."
5,Cute story you won't mind reading over and over again!,"Cute story in either language! My daughter is in a bilingual daycare, but we speak English at home. This book has both languages on each page, which helps make the translating easy. I learned Spanish back in high school, so it helps me remember the verb tenses and understand the more uncommon vocabulary. My daughter likes the pictures and the cadence in either language. A great, fun book and the best I've seen in two languages."
2,"Slow-moving, Rather Silly Mystery","I was hoping for better in this film by Merchant Ivory. I have liked some of their work and others not so much. However, this mystery set in India with an Indian police detective looking for diamond smugglers/thieves is definitely not one of their best and if a series was planned, I trust better was thought of the idea. The Indian detective who is the central figure is supposed to be intelligent but long-suffering and appealingly maladroit with his superiors and his wife at home. However, I found him boring and colorless, and at times downright sappy. Stellen Starsgaard, who looked very young here, plays an almost superfluous character, a visiting Swedish criminologist, who is even more inept than the detective. The plot, in addition to being slow-moving, is rather inane and jerky and overall not very involving. I don't know if the book from which this was derived was good but if so, I would have to say that it was not done justice in this film adaptation."
4,Monsters In My Mailbox,"This is a delightful book filled with zany monsters who come via a ""Monster of the Month"" club. The monsters provide their young owner with loads of entertainment at first, but soon they become quite a problem as the little boy's room overflows with unruly monsters. The havoc they wreck and the final solution for getting them under control make for great reading for young children. Adorable illustrations add to the fun!"
1,Ampad Gold Fibre Writing Pads wide rule letter size,"This item is a disappointment, I have never seen a legal pad that contained staples, but these pads did. As I was sending this to a young man who is incarcerated, he was unable to receive the $25 + order I had sent to him. I wish I had known that in advance. I send many paper orders to those incarcerated."
3,good for the price,it fits well on my 4runner. carries two not three. sturdy and good value for the price. on suv's make sure it goes on the right way. good enough for the job.
1,Broke at seconde use,"The first time we placed 3 bikes on it, the locking mechanism broke, since that we have had contstant problems, we can't put 3 bikes now, the max. is two and you have to be checking that the rack is in place."
4,Great for the price!,This bike rack is pretty sturdy and it does bring something to lock the bikes. I have only used it for short distances but it did the job really well.
2,More like 2,"Mounts to the car fine. Did not cause any dents as other reviews have noted; however, if you plan to carry three bikes I would not buy this carrier. If you have heavy mtn bikes (over 40lbs) you can carry only two bikes.Works fine for everyday small bikes.Bonus cable is very useful."
2,Not the Best Rack,"I just upgraded to this after having to return the 2-bike rack due to the fact that with an infant seat on one of my bikes it was almost impossible to fit two bikes. On the second outing with this 3 bike rack, the locking mechanism that holds the rack vertical broke. Luckily, I had attached another strap around both bikes to the main frame, keeping them from hitting the highway. Needless to say, I will be returning this and looking for a better built rack. If you get this rack, ALWAYS use another strap so you won't have to rely on the velcro straps alone should something happen to the rack while in transit."
3,Defective Rack,I'm using this rack because its not worth the hassle of trying to return it to Target. Perhaps the rack would be worth 5 stars if didn't come with a manufacturer's defect. I had to bend the metal plates open so that they could receieve and lock the arms in place. I still don't have a perfect fit and worry about the arms giving out. So far it is holding one bike up very well but with my next purchase I'll go inspect the rack before purchasing.
2,not for BLS,"This guide might be alright for a Paramedic or maybe and EMT-I, but is completely unsuited for EMT-Bs. Of this 90 page booklet, only two pages are devoted to trauma: all you get here are pupil sizes and Glasgow/trauma scales. There is no Basic Cardiac Life support, the rest of the manual is ECG, ACLS, Drugs,IVs and some medical/drug abbreviations. This is an ALS manual, basically useless to the BLS provider."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I am the author of this book. Whenever you are buying an EMS book, be sure that you are looking at the most current edition. This book is OUT OF DATE, and doesn't have a current edition."
1,"Scare me please? No? Okay, nice try.","While this movie was extremely hyped as being the be all of scare movies, it was pretty much lacking any real scare factors, except the final scene. The entire movie is staged, with two mediocre actors walking around talking about a ghost or possible demonic entity being tied to the female character. Simple tricks, and some lighting was used to create those overly hyped scare scenes. I will not be wasting much more of my time on this review, because in the end it is left to you on deciding whether or not it is worth your time. If cheap thrills scare you then this may in fact be the film for you. As for me, I'll get my scares at HHN and will NOT be watching the second movie. Like the Blair Witch project, this was a waste of time."
2,Bad lead female acting.,"This movie has it's moments but I just couldn't stand the lead female character in the movie. She was incredibly annoying, fat and bad acting. It the movie had a better looking actress then It would have been better. But I can't give a high rating to a movie with a female as bad as she was"
4,Expectations,"I think the ""sophisticated"" and ""savvy"" movie-goer of today often turns out to think he is the 2nd coming of Ebert. I rented this last night, and I turned off the lights, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Played on my worst fear of all. Think every movie should be a freakin ""Titanic"" or ""Avatar"" or ""Lord of the Rings""? Maybe you need to sit down and re-examine your expectations of what you enjoy in movies. I bet half of the entitled, boring, 1-star reviewers here were the same kids years ago that went to see ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" or ""Independence Day"" and thought those were sublime film-making at it's best. Lighten up, for God's sake."
3,"After Blair witch, REC ... PA is so so...","There is some moments, when you know something will happen, that makes you tense ... and that's it."
1,Best Comedy since Blair Witch,"I could not stop laughing. Did anyone notice that windows vista was on the computer. The printer was a multitask printer that was not around in 1996. Ifthe goal was accuracy, this movie bombed. A few special effects could not wake the dead time in between the nights of terror. 3:58 semed to be the magictime that the friendly ghost would appear. There seemed to be no legible writing on the wigi board. It was worth the two bucks to rent. If you bought it,you have joined the millions of people who also wasted thier money on the grudge. Well here is the good part if you have problems getting to sleep thismovie should help."
4,Why blu-ray?,This movie was real good. It starts off slow then picks up and scared the crap out of me as it went along.The question I have is..since the move was filmed in home video .... What will blu-ray offer? maybe extra footgage but how will it improve the image?
1,Boooooooooooooring,I think I could make this movie. It seemed so juvenile. I was not scared at all.I just dont get how this movie made it into the mainstream.
1,Insipidly stupid,"Low budget drivel. 90 minutes of torturous acting and predictability. Easily one of the worst if not the worst movie I have ever watched. The only thing ""scary"" is the actual time and energy wasting to make this nonsense. BnB Beatles Depot"
1,Not a movie A weak documentary,I guess i can record myself and my wife and make i kinds of money. I should of thought of this idea first. damn it!!!!! This crap blows.
1,Pair-a-dorkal Activity,"Wow. Ummm......That's time I spent of my life I'll never get back. The Teletubbies are more terrifying to me. Man that sleep walking is terrifying stuff. Oh and watch out for that shaking chandelier, eerie footsteps, and door that closes on it's own! Oh the horror! Even when they tried to kick up the action in the end it was lame. Total yawnfest."
3,Not for the Weak of Heart,One of the scariest movies of all time ranking with Blair Witch and Poltergeist. Will not be seeing this one again even in HD. It's just way too scary. Stay away from this one after one viewing which is enough no matter what video format (DVD or BD).
1,Boring,"Boring is the one word I would use to describe this movie. As a horror movie and paranormal movie/tv fan, I was bored to death and wanted to leave the theater. Nothing happens for at least the first hour except a few knocking sounds and the changing camera angels. Characters-dull and although it was fiction, you want to slap them for not leaving or getting help if they were that freaked out."
1,What a waste of time - Not even scary!,"I rented this movie because I wanted to see what all of the hype was about. Sadly, I still have no idea why this made more than $100m in the U.S. The dialogue is AWFUL, the editing leaves much to be desired and the supposedly scary scenes don't even make you jump.I wish I hadn't wasted 90 mins of my time on this junk."
1,completely AWFUL........,"I got this as a free rental. NOT even worth free. This couple has got to be the most annoying idiot's. Me and my girlfriend got thru about 20 min, I should have shut it off after 10 min. If I had gone to the movies or actually bought this, I would of demanded my money back.. They should have negative star's for rating's."
1,Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"Let's make this simple, this movie is poor at best. It was not the least bit scary until the last twenty minutes. Even during the last twenty, it was not all that scary. The other sixty minutes is nothing but a video diary of a family that no one really gives a crap about. If you can get this movie for free, get it, you can use it as a doorstop, make it look like you own a lot of movies from afar, or you can take the DVD out and use it as a coaster. If you have to pay for it, then it's not worth the money."
1,Boring!,I thought this film would make me (an asian people)scared because this is a stuff asia people very afraid of. But it's just too boring! I mean the story takes too freaking long and boring! I almost felt asleep...And the ending is so stupid ! A lot of questions are in my head ! Why is the picture in the buring house is in her house? Why does the monster tries to scare her? It's not logical at all ! And the stupid psychic man! comes in the house and leave ! so dumb. I regret to watch this one
1,boring,"the movie was very much on time. in fact i got it earlier than what it was supposed to be. but, it was boring. i experience some of the same stuff on it all the time. but not the bad things. i experience the door,sounds,and lights."
2,Enough of this genre already,"I was stuck in a hotel room and made the mistake of ordering this movie not realizing it was yet another of the failed attempts to recreate whatever ""magic"" was generated by the Blair Witch Project.IMO, this genre outwore its' welcome after about one movie (the aforementioned BWP).Please, enough of these movies. They're really not that good."
2,Just wanted to be startled (at least)...,"Just wanted to be startled (at least)... - Needless to say, it was one of the worst 'horror' movies I've ever seen. Not even a thriller, if you like. All I wanted was to be moved or touched in any way by the story - was I asking too much? Apparently. I just wanted something to happen and nothing did. As a watcher, I do not care about the budget of the movie: I care about liking the outcome.The only thing the movie did was make me hope something worthy would happen until the end of it; and I hoped and hoped and when the end came and nothing has still happened, I just picked another movie to watch."
2,It was good entertainment but thats it.,"I saw this thinking it was based on a true story. Its based on one fact and the rest is fiction. I wasn't super impressed, to me it wasn't scary. Imaginative and interesting yeah but scary?? Not so much. The ol 'Blair witch' trick strikes again. See Haunting in Connecticut if you thought this film was scary then see the 2nd one mentioned and you'll jump out of your skin and all true too. Fiction can be scary too but nonfiction cuts right to the bone. Nice job guys try again for a better result next time."
2,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,"I was really looking forward to seeing this, as I love a good scary, non-gorey movie. This was a huge disappointment, we just kept waiting for something to happen. It is not at all scary, unless you count the last 3 minutes or so."
3,Like an after school special on ghosts...,"LOL...this was more a comedy than a horror. The guy in the movie cracks me up while the girl is a horrible actor. The only reason people get scared in this boring movie is because you are constantly left staring at the screen...looking for something to happen....waiting....waiting....hoping not to miss a shadow or a door move. They try to get you more with anticipation than with horror. I mean, moving doors and scary sounds...big deal? The whole flour incident is stupid. I mean, why would this demon leave footprints, yet remain invisible? There are 2 cool parts of the movie that are a little surprising and well done as a way to shock you. Besides that, its like watching an after school special on ghosts. I dont hate it, but its for sure not scary."
2,Here we go again!!,"Another so called scary movie!! I rented this movie during the weekend,and by seeing the auidence reaction from this movie during the previews I thought that this would actually be a scary movie.Horror movies are my favorite genre of movies, so I know a good horror movie when I see one. In my opinion this movie was not scary at all, all you had were the bedroom door slamming shut, and a few loud bangs at night. They tried to make it scary towards the end but for me it was to little to late. The ending I couldn't take serious because someone was even smilling at the end. I feel sorry for the people who actually paid ten bucks to see this crap at the theaters. One last thing Paranormal Activity did not deserve half the money that it made at the box office!!Bottom line if you want to watch a movie by yourself and be scared rent or buy the ""Strangers"", ""REC"", heck even Animal Planets ""Lost Tapes"". But do not waste your hard earned money on this."
2,Boring..,"Dull, amateurish horror movie about a young couple in a haunted house. It feels like it was made by college students- it is simply the young couple running around with a camcorder, screaming at slamming doors etc... I found it just dragged on and on, even though it's actually a short movie. Same kind of thing as the Blair Witch Project, so if you go in for these zero budget horror movies that try to compensate for their amateurishness by pretending the events portrayed are a 'true story', then you might enjoy this. People (like me) who prefer movies that actually have a plot, good special effects, and exciting things happen, can safely stay away from this one!"
3,"Creepy and boring, all in one","Although successfully creepy, this film fell flat for me. It was extremely slow to start, with at least 45 minutes before it approached interesting. When it did take off, the encounters skipped interesting and went straight to disturbing. Nicely realistic in that capacity, the end was terrible. Any credibility it built up for having a realistic feel sold out to Hollywood in the last 10 seconds."
4,Scary?,"I did like the movie, however for all its hype, it wasn't scary, just entertainment. Might have been mad if I had rushed to the theater to see it."
3,creepier than i thought it would be,"PARANORMAL ACTIVITY.....well what can i say. nothing really new in this movie,nothing outstanding, but i found it to be very creepy. alot of the usual stuff happens. you find yourself asking why don't they move, or why don't they REALLY try to get some help, but,of course, you are expected to suspend belief a bit if you are a horror film buff anyway. some unusual stuff happens also...i don't want to give any spoilers...and i found it to be worth watching. the film manages to squeeze out some real creeps on a minimum budget, much like BLAIR WITCH does.it is almost all implied, so those expecting a roller coaster thrill ride will be disappointed. but if you want a subtle creepfest this could be a movie for you. i know i didn't want to sleep alone the night i watched it."
5,I liked it,"I like movies that seem real. This one seemed real because it used no background music [just like Blair Witch Project] and had a small cast of ordinary people. Like the Algernon Blackwood classic story The Willows, this tale of the supernatural gradually led to it's climax, which is a thing I like. The Invisible Nemesis from Beyond used to be a premise of stories of the supernatural a hundred years ago, but very few films are done these days to depict such a thing.I believe in everything, especially things I cannot prove and cannot observe directly. This film deals with such subject matter. A nice exploration into the quantum world where impossibility is impossible if it has an probability at all."
2,"Creepy? Okay, sure...in a spot or two.","I don't know what everyone in the trailer ""audience"" is screaming about. It didn't even make me flinch, and I have PTSD. On a good day I'm extrememly jumpy. If you don't go into it expecting to feel anything that remotely resembles fear you'll be fine. People who like this movie can go on and on about imagination and their theories about others not using it, but whatever. It's just not going to do it for some of us and that's okay...you're not retarded if it doesn't."
1,paranormal waste of time and money,"fortunaly i was lent this movie and was told the beginning was slow. I was not told however that the end does not get much faster or better. I did like it being filmed as real footage from the homeowners who are having a haunting problem. I feel the movie has good potential but failed to meet it. This movie would qualify for a refund at the theater. I felt cheated of my time, and if i purchased it my money also. Im easily startled, but was not moved much by this movie. Maybe once or twice i was stimulated but other than that prettr boring. I would say dont waste your time watching it, even for free or borrowing the movie it just was not worth the time."
1,Be prepared to use your immagination?,"Get ready for Blair Witch 3...My wife borrowed this movie from the Library...thank God. Yes, there was some suspense but I can't figure out why people are so scared. There are scooby-do episodes that carry more suspense and scare. It was almost as lame as two people stranded at sea in ""Open waters."" People who feel that it is better to use your immagination in movies should go sit in a wet box. With the overwholeming numbers of lame films hitting the market, overly marketed/hyped movies need to stay in the trash bin. Go see House on Haunted Hill (new or old), 13 ghosts, Land of the Dead, 28 days later...almost anything is better (OK...it is better than Blair Witch 1or2)."
1,stupid and bor--ing,"I would give it half a star if it was available. You see nothing scary from beginning to the last 5 minutes til the end. Even then, you like, 'that's it?!' That's right, that's it. Don't buy into the hype. The film is so shallow and not even scary. Anyone who thinks the film is scary is a novice to scary movie. Want real scare, go get The Exorcist."
1,Yawnnnnnnnnn,"This movie almost bored me to death. If you enjoy watching other people sleep, then this movie is for you. If you suffer from insomnia take 20 minutes of Paranormal Activity and thank me in the morning. Save your money, and just watch paint dry."
1,PARANORMAL HYPE!,"This ""movie"" was complete garbage. 1OO% HYPED! The real paranormal activity going on here is how so many people fell for the movie previews claiming this was the scariest film ever seen and people rushed totheaters only to the Blair Witch Project pulled on them again only with way worse acting. There are onlytwo people in this film the whole time. Neither can act! Neither are very smart. This movie is NOT abouta ghost or poltergeist but a possession. I wanted both characters to just die then maybe we would seesome kind of action. You never see anything in this movie. Nothing happens! I shouldn't have to use my imagination when seeing a movie. I can do that at home."
1,"Terrible, cheap movie",I could make a better home movie than that! It's just a home movie!Long and boring and cheap. A fake reality fake home movie.
2,Very cheap movie,"It's like a home movie. It's very very cheaply made. But if you watch it late at night it'll still make you uncomfortable. It has some value, but overall I prefer something with higher production values, higher concept, and with more special effects."
2,Simply not scary,"Just saw this again after having seen it in the theatre. I'll keep it short because it's just my opinion. The premise was interesting. The movie was not only decidely NOT scary, it was borderline dull. Maybe one day, Hollywood will remember how to make a true horror film -- not one that relies on gore or hype without delivery."
3,Predictable Activity,"I truly enjoy watching all the paranormal TV shows (GHI, Ghost Adventures, A Haunting) and this movie was no different, hence it was disappointing. Maybe the $15,000 budget was the tipoff, but I have seen better on the TV show ""A Haunting."" Glad I rented it, even though I was enticed by all the hype to see it in the theater."
2,I've seen it before,"Sorry folks, this movie just takes parts from other movies to try and scare people. The Ouija board scene was done before in William Castle's ""13 Ghosts"" and the ending is a take-off of Karen Black in ""Trilogy Of Terror"". It's all been done before...and better."
1,"Be open minded, and judge yourself.","I'm not some reviewer who likes to bash a bad movie like others do. I have seen it with my wife. It scared the piss out of her, but for me I was just bored and not really not drawned into it. I watch ghost hunters and various shows, but the movie was basically easy to read on what is going to happen next. Again, I'm not saying this is the worst movie of the year or what not. I'm a huge fan of the horror genre. For some reason, I did not like the movie."
1,Snoozefest...,Quite possibly the biggest letdown of the entire year. What happens when you mix one part hype with one part horror? 88 minutes of snooze with 2 minutes of mild excitement. I cannot believe that I just dropped $14 in the theater for this garbage. What baffles me? An 85% on RottenTomatoes. Unbelievable.
1,Worse than Blair Witch,"Just the concept alone makes an intelligent viewer question just how chilling and frightening this movie could be. I suppose I was kind of influenced by the hype and advertising surrounding this movie when it was released in theatres. Sad to say that, as I try to be quite skeptical about what the media feeds the public. So I couldn't help but think that many of those people who actually went to see this movie in the theatres must have felt duped. There really is nothing to this movie for the first 45 minutes or so, and after that the build-up of ""paranormal"" activity didn't exactly have me on the edge of my seat. In the last three minutes or so there is a mildly shocking climax, hardly worth watching a whole movie for. The alternate ending is no better, quite pathetic in fact."
4,Genius Horror Flick,"I love a horror movie that does not rely on just gore, and the same old tricks. This was very much like Blair Witch, but I liked Blair Witch. I loved it, and was creeped out."
5,Great Movie,This was one of my favorite movies in the paranormal activities series. It was the best one out of all four.
3,Good one to have in collection,"This is probably the best one of the few that are out there. Its what started the hole ghost/paranormal movies. Its good, I will say when i watched it the first time in theaters I was scared to go to bed alone that night. Paranormal Activity is surely one you want to have in your collection."
3,Paranormal Activity,My teenager loves this show. I myself hate it. I would have given it one star but I felt I had to consider her opinion as well. It's not that the story is bad. It is just so slow moving I hate to sit still for it.
3,THE SCARIEST THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS THE HYPE...,"Katie and Micah seem to live in a bubble... No friends. No family. No neighbors... and even though Micah is a Day Trader, he never seems to work... its really their personal and social life that is haunted. We have to go through 20 some odd nights before the denouement which does make the hairs stand up on the back of ones neck, however it does not make up or compensate for the lack of the aforementioned character development. Paranormal Activity does offer some thrills and is a great example of a truly independent film made on a shoestring budget and certainly a cut above Blair Witch Project. Overall, great directorial debut for 1st time filmmaker Oren Peli, however the scariest aspect of this film is that it does not live up to its hype."
1,Absolutely Ridiculous,"This is a complete waste of time, not even worth a 5 dollar rental... Cheap, fake, and boring... It was a painful 90 minutes..."
1,YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!,"This movie is based on HYPE and advertisement only. I saw it last week with five friends. NO ONE even jumped, much less screamed in the entire theater. What a JOKE this movie is. It's NOT scary, it's NOT believable and it's NOT even entertaining. Don't waste your money. The trailer for the movie contains ALL the ""scary"" parts. The rest of the movie is watching two people sleep, or talk, or knit, or argue. It's boring and it's stupid and it's not even close to being scary. Wait for it to come on TV, it won't be long."
1,a new kind of horror...the non-horror,"Non-explicit or just suggested horror works when it is well made (Rosemary's Baby) but that is not the case here.This is just an amateurish home video which never works, never involves you, never scares you. it only causes two reactions, the constant look to your watch and the same question hammering inside your mind during 86 minutes, like, where is the horror? the young woman thinks that some evil spirit is inside her house because of some distant and faint noises, feeble grunts, a door which opens...and closes during the night?I should invite her to stay one night in my apartment, where she would be terrified listening to neighbors dragging furniture, imsomniac housewives cleaning the floor after midnight, hysterical moms shouting to screaming babies, restless footsteps above my head...the big mistake made by these director is that he only creates expectations, and fails terribly because that is what you get in the end, only expectations..."
2,Movie OK - sound was atrocious!,"Movie was Ok but the sound quality was alful. Sadly as I have stated in my previous review of the forth kind, I do not have these problems with any other competing service I use. Due to this I will start spendingMy money elsewhere in this dept."
4,Pretty good,"While by no means an incredible movie, I found it to be pretty enjoyable and relatively scary. I put off watching it for years because some of the people I know hated it, said it was too slow etc. I for one, do not understand what was slow about it, it's called a plot people...stuff happens enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend it to anyone who is not a baby about movies shot in this way."
4,Great movie,One of my fave halloween movies. Love it and watch it every year. My kids even love it and watch it too
4,The best horror movie in a long time.,"This is a great horror movie. It will scare the crap out of you the first time you watch it, but it does seem to be less creepy the second time around. I guess that could be true with almost any horror movie once you know where the scares are. It just goes to show you, that you dont need millions of dollars to make a great horror movie."
1,Stupedist Movie I Have Ever Seen,"I got this movie from Netflix because my boyfriend and I are fans of horror movies even though I usually get scared really easy. Nothing about this movie scared me. In fact, I found it to be stupid and wish I had never seen it. I wouldn't waste my money on it. If you are looking for a horror movie that really scares the pants off you, than this isn't it."
1,Boring!,A whole lot of nothing happens in this film. Slower than a snail oozing across the grass its just as exciting to watch. It wasn't scary. It wasn't interesting. It wasn't anything but a waste of time.
2,STUPID GIRL,"THIS MOVIE WAS ENTERTAINING. THE GIRL THAT WAS PLAGUED WITH FORCES UNKNOWN WAS STUPID FOR LISTENING TO HER KNOW IT ALL BOYFRIEND. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GETTING HELP FROM THE CHURCH FOR AND EXORCISIM OR SOMETHING. SHE NEVER ATTEMPTED ANY OF THAT. SHE WAS TO TOLERANT WITH HER BOYFRIEND. HE KNEW NOTHING, BUT SHE LET HIM CONTINUE TO PROVOKE THIS ENTITY. FOR ME WHEN HE GOT THAT OUJI BOARD,( not sure of the spelling) WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST STRAW FOR ME! GET OUT! FINALLY SHE SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND THEN IT WAS TOOOOO LATE... GOOD MOVIE ALONG WITH BLAIR WITCH TO HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION. LOVE THE ALTERNATE ENDINGS. RAGDOLL DUDE TOWARD CAMERA WAS THE BEST ONE."
2,Love it or Hate it,"This movie will get very mixed reviews. The first hour of this movie is very boring. It's mostly just this couple sitting around talking about there haunted house. But, if you stay to the end it's almost worth it. I've seen both endings and enjoyed them both. It does not make up for the first hour though. Yes, this movie does get scary toward the end but your ready to stop watching long before you reach that point."
1,Paranormal Bored!!!!!,"This film was successful only because it was well distributed and advertising ,is very boring and perhaps frighten some people too fearful, nothing happens throughout the film!!!!! I will not buy it on Dvd or Blu-Ray and I dont want it as a gift!!"
5,Draws you into it's clutches,"Great horror film. The only other theatrical screenings I've been to that were close to this are The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, & Alien.This one starts slow, develops the characters well, and progessively gets more suspenseful until it ends with it's penultimate finale. Easily the best horror offering in the last 20 years. If you're into gore and blood like Saw and Hostel, you'll be disappointed. If you like an edge-of-your-seat thriller with excellent acting & direction, this is for you. Don't listen to the negative reviews by people that try to compare this to movies that scared them when they were children. This is the real deal for horror fans."
2,Paranormal Activity,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out and what I got upon watching it once I ordered it from Amazon was NOT the same movie! There were crucial parts left out of this version as well as scenes that were shortened..what happened?I am NOT satisfied with this ""bootleg"" version for which I paid full price for!"
4,Still gives me chills,This movie was really good. My wife and I got chills during the movie. A lot better than the Blair Witch Project. Other reviews sound a lot like the boyfriend moking whats happening but from other perspectives it can get pretty chilling.
3,Digital copy for USA only?,"I found Paranormal Activity refreshingly creepy. Not scary for me (although others felt otherwise). With at least 3 endings having been filmed, I'm surprised that only one alternative ending was included.Regarding the Blu-ray version - how does someone outside the USA gain access to the digital copy?Surely the blu-ray people and the film distributors can't have been so short-sighted as to make this feature geographically restricted?!"
1,Blair Witch Project Documentary-style DUD!,"I will NOT lie...I did NOT watch the FULL movie. I didn't even watch HALFWAY through the movie. It was SOOOO boring and SOOO dumb, I couldn't sit through ONE MORE MINUTE of it after 20 min. of viewing.I was expecting a REAL movie, not shaking-unsteady cameras and two ""dummies"" making a ""home-video."" It is NOT a movie, but documentary-format. I thought Blair Witch Project was a ""dud,"" but I sat through the WHOLE movie and even talked about it for a couple days afterwards. Paranormal Activity does NOT engage the viewer AT ALL in the first 20 minutes....Kudos to those who sat through it and got the heeby-jeebies (as they say) but I just COULDN'T tolerate it beyond 20 min. of PURE STUPIDITY!If you DON'T like movies that seem like an amateur taking a ""HOME VIDEO,"" like the ""Blair Witch Project,"" this movie is JUST THAT! Don't expect the movie-style to be like ""Psycho"" or ""Halloween."" There is NO plot, NO story...just two amateurs making a HOME VIDEO."
2,Paranormal Activity,"I really did'nt see anything in there that was actually scary. Looked very set up to me. Anyone can sleep stand and walk and not remember it. Not Happy at all. It should be Free, cos it's not worth $5.00. I think it's stupid."
1,Just awful!,This was scary??????????? It was just plain stupid. It took all I could do to just stay awake.
3,A slow build to a worthy ending,"This film is the definition of a ""slow build"" suspense film. Much like The Blair Witch Project, this is a movie filmed as if it were based on real events and shot with little production on a shoestring budget. There are only four people ever on screen; the characters are believable and the performances of the two leads, a couple who decide to film the strange ""paranormal activities"" going on in their house, really allow the audience to be sucked into their world. The only complaint is that this is still meant to be a horror film and the scares are few and far between. The ending, however, is absolutely fantastic."
5,"Very good, very good","In this movie, there is not a lot of blow'em up stuff, car chases, fights, blood, and if those types of movies are for you, then read no further because you will be disappointed.If you like good ol' horror movies, then read on. I loved this movie for the fact it was simple and puts you on the edge of your seat. My wife and I went to the movie theater and watched it we enjoyed it very much. This is a good date movie for a guy because if your girl gets scared, she could end up in your lap.This is the best horror movie made since The Exorcist. That is saying a lot because there are a lot of good horror movies out there.A must see for any horror movie fan!!!!"
4,Creepy,I thought this movie was scary. A few scenes in particular really creeped me out to the point I hardly slept for 2 nights.
2,Paranormal Activity [HD],Worse than the Blair With Project. It might entertain a teenager but its not really scary as an adult. We watched this one and the sequels and they continued to get worse.
1,VERY NORMAL ACTIVITY YAWN,"I do not like scary movies my wife does.The advertising deserves an Emmy award as it sold her on the movie.But it was classic bait and switch.The whole movie is basically the commercial,only the commercial was actually better than the movie.From the ads we both thought this movie might be too scary.It wasn't the least bit scary at all, we found ourselves looking at each other many times saying ""that was lame"". I'd be thinking boy somethings really going to happen now... and nothing.The most intense ""action"" on the screen was the time lapse counter.So many missed opportunities to make things really scary or creepy. Brings a whole new meaning to ""low budget horror movie.""my wife was disappointed I was relieved."
1,Good Screaming,"Scary?(1.) Walking sounds.(2.) Door moving a little bit.(3.) More walking sounds.(4.) Door moving a bit more.(5.) Slightly swinging chandelier.(6.) Door moves more.(7.) Ceiling access cover to attic slightly open.(8.) Shadow and covers of bed move a little.(9.) Covers move a little more.(10.) More walking sounds.(11.) Scratches on floor for no reason.(12.) Screams ever so often for no reason.Dumb!(1.) Couple sets up only one camera.(2.) Investigator comes and goes and does nothing. That's investigation?(3.) Couple sleeps each night as if nothing has happened previous nights, and on and on.(4.) Couple stay in house and don't even temporarily move out.Scary parts?(a.) Scream.(b.) Another scream."
5,I'm glad I voted for this movie!,"I'll keep this short. I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't the scariest movie ever, and I didn't jump out of my skin. But I did enjoy the tension and the atmosphere this film created. I liked the special effects as well. I would recommend this movie to my friends, and if you're a big fan like me, I would definetally recommend this collector's edition set with t-shirt and film cell from the movie.If you haven't seen this movie yet, and are considering it, please, watch it in the dark and crank up the volume. It makes for a more enjoyable experience."
2,Blair Witch Deja Vu,"If you did not like 'The Blair Witch Project' you probably will not like this one either. It's an agonizingly slow burning candle if, like me, you're an empiricist and don't believe one iota in an unverifiable supernatural world. In fact it will quickly seem contrived and quite silly. In fact, the relationship between the two principals was more interesting than all the boogieman stuff. Their 'partnership' was downright annoying. It struck me as uncomfortably modern, without real affection and fraught with the certainty of future dysfunctionality. You will probably hate yourself the morning-after if you spend money to watch this decidedly unscary effort. Lary9"
3,"A review of the movie, not the disc","Blair Witch fans will enjoy this movie. I am not a BW fan so I did not. It is passable for what it is. It makes you feel as if these events really happened. If these stuff had happened to you or I we would freak out. However, in movie form it is pretty dull. 90% of the time these people are just talking about how scared they are or how to fix the problem. When the action is taking place it is well done. The last 15 minutes ramp up very well and are the best part. The finale of the film is scary. Unfortunately they show it on the commercial so few will be surprised when it happens."
1,Worst thing ever,"Ooooooooo scariest movie ever. Please. I've taken bowel movements scarier than this movie. Mercifully I don't own it, and didn't even have to spend money to watch it as a friend had rented it. I would have rather had body parts amputated without anesthesia. Oh no, random noises! Scary. A girl standing by her bed! Even scarier! Her sleepwalking! That was the scariest part of the movie. I feel sorry for anyone who actually spent money to watch this. I feel even sorrier for those of us who sat through this slop. I want my time back. I was cheated."
1,top ten worst,easily the worst film i have seen in many years. i would not even classify this as a film. it is grossly stupid and undramatic.
1,Had to fast forward to get to something to watch,This movie was soooooo bad I had to keep FF>> to get to something worth watching. At the end I was so happy with the outcome because I didn't have to find these people and kill them. How did this make it to the movie screen???? Just another ???? that will go unanswered. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT RENT IT OUT OF RED BOX OR A BLOCKBUSTER BOX DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE YOU WILL BE SORRY.
1,Greatest waste of time/cheapest crap...,"...ever crafted by pseudo movie-makers. Ewww...still trying to recover $14.00 and the 3 hours I spent watching this crap and wishing for something scary, exciting, interesting or at least funny to happen but no luck.Memorably, it's the worst movie I watched in my entire life. It is unfortunate that so many were impressed by this and keep spending money to watch the sequels. If I had known THIS could work, I'd had already made my own pseudo-film inside my apartment and probably gone more creative.What-a-crap. Wow. They probably spent $500.00-$1000.00 total and traded crew work for school credits. LMFAO, deserves a parody. This, I'd watch."
3,Average Beyond Belief - I don't get all the attention this movie got.,"Average Beyond Belief - I don't get all the attention this movie got. I see they are up to number 3. This was one of the slowest movies and had some of the most annoying cast I have seen in years. I found myself praying something would happen to the stars. The first hour is hard to stay awake through. Building a story is one thing, moving at the pace of a slug is another.Believe me this is not a spoiler but there is a scene where the wimpy lead guy gets truly angry and cursed and says something like That's It. I have had it. I am going to do something about this right now. He then proceeds to light a fire in the fireplace. Albeit with anger. Whoa, spirits better watch out. He lit the fireplace...with anger."
1,Not even a good student production,The movie might have been interesting as the imaginings of an emotionally disturbed girl.What we get is a film in which nothing happens over and over again.
3,Quick Review to help you get to the point,Better than the first Paranormal Activity but only by a bit. It has a baby and a dog which ups the creep factor.Some amazing cheap scares.Little more mature in terms of content and language (which helps its cause).Amazing sound for those of you who can watch this in Dolby 5.1.You want a good haunted house story that doesnt make you think. This is a good bet.
1,Where are the names at the end?,Is it only on the region 1 version of this that you get to see your name in the end credits?I have a region 2 version and this does not?
2,"Ok, plot gaps","I respect the concept of the movie in a day where torture and gore passes as horror but it did little for me.I get the plot, negativity etc. but I think it would have been better if the couple mistakenly allowed the entity in instead of the boyfriend being a jerk. It would've been cool if unrelated stress along with the camera etc inadvertently allowed the creature in. The confusion is the terror. The biggest problem I had was.... the lack of a good ole Priest!The FIRST place I would've gone is to the closest Catholic Church...and I'm not Catholic lol!By the end it was annoying. Then, the entire concept of imagination was ruined by the girl killing the guy on camera. Would've been better just to have the screams, silence, maybe 2 minutes of nothing or slight shadow shifts, and credits."
2,well?,Wasn't such a fan - I guess it was just not for me. BUT - no download jitters or stalls - very happy with movies steamed from amazon.
3,"The connection was very choppy, the film was ok.","The connection was very choppy, the film was ok. At the same time, when I watch Paranormal Activity 3, the connection was very good."
1,Almost as scary as those internet gags,"So, I decided to shell out the 5 bucks to get this movie on demand. Bad choice. What I had heard about this movie from my friends made it sound like I would never sleep again if I watched it, so naturally I had to see it eventually. When I first started watching it, the first thing I thought was ""So, when does it get scary?"", a thought that would stay with me throughout the remainder of the movie. For me, the scariest part was the last 20 seconds of it, and even the ending was less scary than one of those scary picture gags on the internet. The only reason I can think of for watching this movie is to do a parody ""screening"" of it on youtu- oh, wait, a million people already have. Never mind. Just don't buy it."
1,Don't Bother,This is one of the worst movies ever. With all the hype surrounding it's release and what a disappointment! Horrible. Just fast forward to the last 10 minutes.Ugh! Trash.
1,Not at all suspenseful - would give it zero stars if I could,"I am truly surprised at how many people found this movie scary - if you have ever watched any paranormal activity show on TV/cable, you will have had bigger scares. There was no suspense and the characters were boring. Last five minutes of both the ""regular"" and ""alternative"" endings were the best parts of the movie. Tied with Blair Witch Project as one of the most over-rated movies ever."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"Can you watch this movie? Yes. Will you think it's scary or intense? No. The acting is incredibly dull and moronic - this couple has the most boring conversations and lives of anyone I've ever known. You watch the counter tick down fast, then it slows because ""something's about to happen!"" And, what the? Everytime something does happen, you'd think they'd turn on a light, or even turn on a light when heading downstairs - no, all that darkness, I guess, is suppose to add drama. Well, it doesn't."
2,for the big screen only,Went to see this movie at the theater and found it interesting. It is one to be seen on the big screen. A dvd will not do it justice! I won't buy this dvd. I saw it once and once is enough.
1,All Hype no activity,"Wow, this was a really BORING movie. I'm not easily scared but ghost movies freak me out, since...I think I've seen a few weird things in real life, paranormal if you will. This movie was hyped to be SO SCARY, but it was nothing more than a couple thumps, opening doors, footprints, etc... The action was minimal and the talking was never ending, BOOOOOOOOOOOORING! Seriously, I've seen scarier Goosebumps episodes, LOL!"
1,Paranormal Craptivity,"The only great thing about this film was the marketing. The review saying it's the scariest film ever scene was a joke. After seeing the film, it did not live up to 2% of the hype. Instead of being suspenseful, it dragged. 5 minutes of the film were entertaining and thats about it. Don't waste your money. Go rent The Exorcist instead if you want to see a real horror movie."
1,Movie was a joke,"Very poor acting, poor quality totally unbelieveable! I thought it was a spoof movie at first!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"OMG ... what a total bunch of hype on this movie. It's not the worst, but it is a far cry from anything great in horror films. There were a couple of somewhat scary scenes, but that's it."
1,Paranormal Activity,"The only activity I saw was boring and I fell asleep to various parts, I hated blairwitch and I hate this, Holding the camera type movies are dumb and the acting was horrible,this is over rated and people are being too kind to how boring this is. Here's the movie in a nutshell : People sleeping,Girl getting out of bed watching her boyfriend,being dragged at one point,and a shrink who is a horrible actor,if this was sold out at the moviesyou should have got your money back cause it blows chunks."
1,Huh?,"Somebody got paid to make/produce this movie?Im in the wrong business.Was this supposed to be scary?Have a plot?Be interesting?Be entertaining?86 minutes felt like 4 hours of whatching..er...um..well, I'm not sure what to call it.Movies like this are why AMZN needs a 'negative review rating' as it is not deserving of even a single star. Others may like it and I think thats great. But, I cant say I did and I normally really like these type flicks, although I also thought Blair Witch was pitiful. I rank this higher then Blair Witch, but that still aint saying much."
1,bore-a-normal activity,"i liked blair witch - unique, spooky, suspenseful. paranormal activity was dull from the start. Katie Featherston was terrible - very unconvincing and that distracted from the whole movie. i liked the amateur feel of the cinematography, but that didn't make up for bad cast selection.i think i've been more scared (and certainly more entertained) watching Baby Einstein Videos."
2,Waited For Something To Happen...,and it never happened. If you like loud noises and lights turning off you will probably like this movie. If this movie scares you then you scare way too easy.Maybe it was just over hyped and I expected to see something different. Two stars because I did watch the entire thing in hopes that something would happen. If it was one star bad I wouldn't have been able to stick with it.
1,"If you like watching people sleep, this is the movie for you","Half an hour into this movie we wanted to turn it off. We decided to keep watching because of all of the hype. Hoping that it would get better. At an hour, I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to turn it off (hoping he would). We decided to keep watching because something had to happen right? No one would make a movie so boring without something really good happening at some point. Well, finally in the last five minutes something happens. Not much, but something. The best comparison I can make is it's like an hour and a half episode of Ghost Hunters except it's fake, so the few little supernatural incidents are not the least bit scary becuase we know it's fake. If it were real, it might have made a good Ghost Hunters episode. Shame on the person who compared it to a Hitchcock film."
1,O V E R R A T E D,Nothing happens in the first hour and when (scary?) stuff does happen it's not that scary.Much ado about nothing.
1,garbage,"remember Blair Witch, same crap new cast? How can there be more than one of these movies. People are stupid I guess."
1,Scooby Doo Far More Scary,"This movie sucked. Big time. You spend half of the movie wondering why the bleep is the guy so stupid and the other half in anticipation of whatever big climatic scene is supposed to happen. Well it never came. Not even when Micah is supposedly thrown across the room. Seriously don't waste your hour and 25 minutes watching it. It's precious time that you won't get back and honestly, wouldn't you rather do something meaningful like...watch the grass grow?"
4,SUPERnatural!,"If you think you'll like it, you will. This film confirmed two things for me I've always thought: The paranormal type films scare me WAY more than any slasher flick ever could, and I love a busty brunette!"
1,100% Hype,"I don't understand the people that thought this movie was great. Everything about it was low budget - except the marketing.Low budget doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a bad movie, but in this case it does. This is just another Blair Witch look a like. It has the same single hand held camera look and feel. Apparently, we are supposed to wonder ""is this real"". It's not, and it doesn't look it.There are no special effects, but far worse, there is not much of a script. Yet again, movie moguls have figured out a way to rip us off. They hyped this crap and laughed all the way to bank.Save your money, and save your time. Honestly, if I could rate this movie below one star, I would."
1,Horrible,"Interesting concept, horrific acting by the two leads, and the sound quality is AWFUL! This is the first movie I have had to put captions on to understand what the hell the actors were saying, and I have a decent home theater system. NOTHING happens the entire movie, the ending is underwhelming, and I was not scared the entire movie, not even a little jump. Definitely is not worth the 24.99 price tag, as well as the blu ray transfer being one of the worst I have ever seen audio and video wise. If you MUST see it, definitely a rental."
1,Absolute waste of money and space,"This ""movie"" is garbage.I see no point in wasting 25Gb of space to put this on a blu-ray disc, or $30+ to own it. This is not a feature film, it's not scary except literally he last 90 seconds or so and it's probably the cheapest scare in Hollywood history. The only reason I watched this was because of all the hype -- and that's all this thing is; pure hype.You know that part in the trailer where they show everyone in the audience jumping out of their seats? Yeah, that's the last 3 seconds of the film...the rest of the film is a snore.Has anyone ever sent you one of those pictures where they tell you to look closely for something in the background or follow a maze, then suddenly the creepy face pops up and it screams at you? Yeah, that's pretty much the summary of Paranormal Activity. Save your money and just Google ""scary maze game""."
5,"It's a great psychological thriller,","Highly rated if you like scary movies, we enjoyed it thoroughly and my wife was creeped out for a few nights afterward."
4,Scary Activity,"First in the PA series of movies.I am a Paranormal Activity fan, I llike all of them, although I am not sure why."
5,Pretty Scary!,"I rented this movie for 24 hrs. It was well worth the price at the couple of dollars I spent. Very suspenseful, unexpected ending, but a lot of the dialog was difficult to hear and pointless as well, which doesn't really ENHANCE the sense that you're watching someone's ""hamemade"" video. It's just annoying."
2,No way.,It was fine when it was scary. It was horrible when it got bloody. It went go far and become just another disgusting slasher movie.
1,INSULT TO HELL .......hades ..... 9863345.....GWTHP...mpch,"...no fury like a woman scorned ... scariest part? - 3 toed footsteps leading to the bed ..... NOW kiddies .... 3 toes footspets leading FROM the bed would have given me a coronary ...and left real pucker marks on the seat.SILLY - silly demon? THAT was a demon????????????? [ugh! yecch!] .....for a real terror scare : Robert Wise 1963 ""Haunting"" - ""Who was holding my HAND""?????and/or ""The Entity"" or the delightfully proper ""The Innocents"" ......Nice hunky dude who deserves having his bones smashed ..... girl too Fat!!!!!now if the movie was about a succubus .......... neatoh! and Yummo!!!!ah well, onto the next flavor for the masses ........"
1,Hype was better than the Movie,Don't know why anyone would buy this DVD. The movie was awful. Just download the trailer! Those scenes in the trailer are the best parts of the movie. Period!
4,Tense and terrifying,"It's not big-budget effects, but the minimal use of them and the maximum use of tension and suspense that makes this work.As the husband, Micah, continually taunts and challenges the entity, your dread level is ratcheted up and up until the next scare sequence. Every bang and bump is invested with terror.If you like to be really scared, this may do the trick. If not, avoid this movie!"
4,"More an exercise in suspense than a movie, but quite good for what it is.","For an alleged $15,000, filmmaker Oren Peli has taken the concept of a horror film using ""found footage"" and managed to succeed where the Blair Witch Project failed miserably.The movie focuses on an engaged couple, Micah and Katie, as they try to get to the bottom of the weird noises and events that Katie has been experiencing since a house fire when she was a kid. Micah documents their house over a series of days using his high definition video camera. As the events get stranger, Katie gets more and more concerned that Micah is angering whatever is behind these strange occurrences.Peli does a great job of amping up the tension, but can't deliver a payoff comparable to what led up to it. But the movie itself is excellent for what it is.Note to DVD viewers. The sound mix is muddled at times. Turn on the subtitles, you'll be glad you did."
1,"Not scary, ending given away in the commercials.","Fortunately I saw this for free so I didn't have to walk out or anything. In my mind the Discovery channel show ""Haunting"" is scarier than this movie. Nothing really creepy happens until the final few minutes of the film, until then it's just a lot of creaky doors and banging.I'd think if they gave the same budget to a local Halloween haunted house pretty much anywhere in the country they could have made a better, scarier, film.The real strike against it is showing the ending in the commercials though. I kept waiting for the bit where Micha is thrown through the door... sure enough it happens... RIGHT AT THE END OF THE MOVIE! Literally 20 or 30 seconds from the end of the film.Way to ruin things marketing department!"
4,A throw back to the good old days of scary movies that left the fright up to your imagination.,"Most of the negative reviews I've seen about Paranormal Activity are based on the level of ""boredom"" that the viewer had. Sadly I would attribute this to years of scary movies showing you what you should be scared of rather than allowing us to see just enough to let the mind fill in the blanks. Many people today have a hard time using their imagination when going to the movies because they are so use to movies filling in all the visual blanks for them. While I would agree to an extent with the ""boredom"" and lack of scariness during the first 15-20 min. (keys dropping, lamps shaking, pounding on walls...stuff like that) it did eventually pick up. The low budget Blair Witch documentary style simply adds to the believability of the story. I'd also add that if you even remotely buy into the possibility of demonic forces...by the end it will scare the hell out of you."
2,Bored Now,"From all the great reviews this movie's received (especially from critics), I was expecting to at least like it if not love it. I must say I was very disappointed in what I saw.Here's a quick rundown:The Good- The actors did a good job.- There was a good funny scene, which was the only thing I remembered when I left the theater.The Bad- This movie wasn't scary at all. If you're one of those people who closes their eyes and covers their ears when watching horror movies, you might find this one scary...because you won't be able to see/hear that it's not!- The movie was mostly boring. There was a little suspense, but not enough to make me care. I just wanted it to be over or for something interesting to happen. At least my first wish was granted. :)- The ending. Could have been a lot better.In conclusion, don't waste your money on this one. If you must see it, wait for the DVD and rent it.Also: Blair Witch Project was better."
2,"Weak, real weak","I love a good scary movie that creates tension and thrill from creative means rather than simply relying on gruesome and over the top gore. Paranormal Activity made an honest attempt, but even alone in the dark the scariest part of the movie was when I ran out of beer. The plot unfolds in a predictable manner with an escalation of ""paranormal activity"" until the climax of the movie. There is even a convenient sound effect (a low base rumble or something) that tells you when to pay attention because something is about to happen. Bottom line I've scooped scarier things out of my cat's litter box..."
2,cliché,"Somewhat interesting in that the film is homemade and the filmmaker created the special effects himself, but the whole thing is a colossal cliché: the wife is terrified of the entity in the house, the husband insists on provoking it (while the wife screams at him to stop), and in the end the demon takes over the wife and she kills the husband.This movie would never have been seen if Steven Spielberg hadn't come upon it and gotten it released. Now we have Paranormal 2, 3, 4, 5, and the filmmaker is a very lucky man for being in the right place at the right time."
1,monumental piece of s^*t,"a really bad ripoff of the first 20 minutes of the excorcist, or any of the possession routine. Horrid acting. Cinema Verite at its very very lamest."
1,Glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters,"When I heard all the hype for this movie, I had a sense of deja vu...it took me back to 1999, and a little film called ""The Blair Witch Project"". Yet another movie hyped to be ""superscary"" that was anything but. All but the last 10 minutes were just an ass-numbing bore. Even then, those last 10 minutes were hardly what I would call superscary...I've seen scarier stuff on Youtube.Basically, this movie is a good hour of watching people sleep, with some weird noises thrown in. Oh, you also get to see them eat, surf the internet, etc....Yaaay! I only paid $1 to rent this from Redbox, and I considered trying to get that back.I didn't buy into the hype, and was glad I didn't. It's a turkey."
2,"Should be called 'My Douche Boyfriend's Activities""","This movie was just okay. Both characters started to annoy me. The girl should have ousted her boyfriend sooner for being such a douche and making things worse. Also, I would have ran to a catholic church after seeing the demon footprints. I especially would have ran directly to a catholic church after being dragged out of bed and bitten by a demon. What I would NOT have done is continue listening to my douche boyfriend and letting him try to solve the problem via Google searches. I also would NOT have burned a cross assuming that would scare the demon away."
2,"Yawn...ZZZZ. Did something happen? Oh, She's still sleep-walking? Ok. ZZZ.....","This is the classic example of the over-hyped movie. All I heard was how ""scary"" this movie was and how I would sleep with the lights on for a week after watching it. It wasn't to be. There are a few moments of genius but they fail to scare. Whatever is haunting the couple's house is an uncreative spirit. One night it only manages to move their bedroom door a couple inches. Gasp! Terrifying! If I was the ghost I would place their hands in warm water or drag their bed downstairs so they would wake up in the kitchen! The film spends too much time on miniscule ""scares"" with the only legitimate ""scare"" coming at the end, it's cool but predictable.You could probably fast forward 40-50 minutes of the movie and not miss anything.Not bad, not good."
2,really weak,"Very disappointing. It had the potential to be really scary -- but failed miserably along the way. Micah's lame and insensitive behavior only serves to interrupt the flow of the film. Choppy and slow paced, it was a real bummer for this horror film fan."
2,Very Slow,"The only thing I can say is that I am so glad I didn't actually go the theater to see this movie. I love this type of movie but this was just too slow and boring. It picked up a bit at the end, though by that time it lost my interest and also most of the ""scare"" factor."
3,SPOOKS GONE WILD,"Take away the massive hype and what you have isn't a whole lot more than an episode of GHOSTHUNTERS or PARANORMAL STATE. There are some spooky moments in the last five minutes, but up to that point, it's pretty dull. I also didn't find either character very likeable. Why didn't they just move and find out if the ghost was following her or was she just a little paranoid or attention seeking? While I found PA much more interesting than BLAIR WITCH, I feel the movie's success is a direct result of the Internet hype..it's not a great film by any means. Kudos for the movie riding that hype to its record breaking box office, but I don't think it will be remembered a year from now."
3,Healing needed,"Her story is interesting. However, I believe the presentation of it could have been better. (More organized, more tightly edited.) Also, at the risk of sounding like a total fanatic, I just have to say that I wish she could know the love of Jesus and experience healing from some of her painful, dysfunctional past. I just felt reading this that she is a classic case of looking for love (and healing) in all the wrong places! It seemed like a lot of her wrong choices stemmed out of an attempt to heal from hurts inflicted on her which were never processed and exorcised."
3,Breathing out,"It was alright, learned a few things about her I didn't know. It was written well and it was an easy read."
2,Not sure why she choose to write a book,Very easy read. However I personally liked Peggy Lipton better before I read her book than I do now. I was a major Mod Squad fan and there was some info on that but the rest just reminded me of goofy young people kinda stuff JMO
5,A memoir of growing up too fast in the 1960s,"If actress Peggy Lipton's name is immediately familiar, it must be because of her hit success acting as Julie on the Mod Squad series, which made her a fashion icon and the ultimate 1970s girl - but there's much more to her, as her autobiography Breathing Out reveals. This isn't just an actress' gathering of Hollywood celebrity associations, but a memoir of growing up too fast in the 1960s, struggling with drugs and fame, and entering the world of fashion and modeling. The black and white centerfold of photos follows her highlights, but it's her own words which document a striking life - and a striking era."
4,If you were ever a fan of Peggy Lipton and Mod Squad.,I thought this was an interesting book. Peggy is honest about her life in it.
3,Am I still breathing?,"This book is okay, if you are a Peggy Lipton fan. It is interesting to see how ""Julie Barnes"" from Mod Squad was in real life. But it won't win any literary awards."
1,a landmark of nothingness,"Can't see what is supposed to matter in this person's life. Can't see what even very unimaginative men could see in her. Can't see why she was alluring, to anyone, even people who did nothing but watch television and eat cheese curls.What in the world was Paul McCartney thinking?"
2,"Nothing special, not particularly shiny","I bought this product in hopes that it would make my nails appear very shiny. I have not noticed any difference in the level of shine between this and any other top coats I own (such as Butter London PD Quick and Essie Good to Go). I actually wore different top coats on different fingers at the same time so that I could compare. The CND Super Shiny did not make the nails any shinier than any of the other top coats. Given the price and the fact that it is a CND product, I was expecting a lot more."
5,Good product,"Shiny nails, top coat hels nail lacquer last for a more long time, than usuall. So i advice 2 use this product over coloured nails."
5,The best topcoat ever!,"I'm a huge fan of CND's sticky base coat & shiney topcoat. The topcoat is not only shiney, but dries fast and gives a durable finish to your manicure. By starting with sticky & ending with shiney, I can get about a week from my manicure when used with OPI polish on natural nails. I've tried other base & topcoats, but don't get the wear that I get from the CND products."
1,Not worth the money or the time,"I bought this in hopes that I could paint my nails clear and have them look wet and shiney. Well this little product left them pretty dull and this chips pretty easily. Let me explain. When you paint your nail with this, it dries very thin, so thin that it chips very easily. So please, dont wast your money with this. There are better clear polishes, i would recommend Essie's clear nail polish."
2,Very faint,"I use my white board daily and these markers are just not bold enough to see more than 6 inches away from the board. The company's customer service department was excellent in responding to my complaint. I don't think I got a ""faulty set"", I believe that the markers just aren't dark enough for my use."
1,These are not boone markers,They havew been replaced with poor quality markers as boone was bought out. Not worth a dime
2,Thick tip with dull colors,"I used to use these on my dry erase calendar. The tips were very large and it was difficult to fit a lot of print in each square. Some of the colors were also too pale to be visible. I replaced them with these markersExpo Vis-A-Vis Wet Erase Markers, 8 Colored Markers (16078)and am much happier. Those have a nice fine point tip with strong, bright colors."
2,"Good markers, doubled colors","Product is not as advertised- 5 colors, not 6.The marker that has an orange cap actually writes red just like the red one in the pack. So you don't get the 6 colors you paid for.The tips are fine, and they write fine."
1,this not the same brand name I order,"I would like to have BOONE dry-erase makers but they sent me with QUARTET dry-erase markers, that is not what I want."
1,Received as defective,"Probably a good tile saw as Home Depot uses them in their rental department, however, the reset button fell into the motor. Appears it wasn't mounted to the case so had to return it, all 113 lbs."
4,Excellent film but the script????,I have to say when I first read the script I was kinda of disappointed because there are changed lines in it like the scene where Frank meets his father for the first time its almost completely changed but I'm not mad its cool reading stuff from what Anderson wrote first But disappointing there are so many great stuff that are in the film but not in the script thats why I'm disappointed. Its a very well done script but changed.See Magnolia first and then read the screenplay.Matt
4,"Great Greece, Great guide","I used this book to plan a honeymoon, and it was very helpful. Because this book focuses on only two islands, you don't get stuck carrying around information on places you don't plan to see. The content is comprehensive and useful. It gives a lot cultural information, which is great, and the where to stay/where to eat information is more detailed than broader Island books."
3,flimsy,"I bought this item for my Wife for her birthday in March 2005, the camera responds slowly and 3 months after we bought it the only movable item which is the right in front with the little silver push button on it Fell out. This made the camera virually unusable and sitting on my desk until we found out that to get this part fixed and installed would be another 100 dollars. Getting a receipt from my credit card company took 2 weeks and any response from Amazon and JR music world was fruitless.I am now waiting for 3 different companies to respond so that i can get this thing fixed under warranty.To be Continued..."
1,privacy advocates won't like it,"I'm uneasy about having to provide my personal information to register myself before I can use a CAMERA (specifically its RAW function). Even everyone's favorite villain, Microsoft, allows their products to be used whether or not you are willing to enroll yourself in their databanks.Also, even bad-guys Microsoft allows the use of a telephone to complete their ""anti piracy procedure"" for those whose computers are not hooked up to the internet. This upsets me because I like to use one computer for ""important"" stuff and a different computer for internet stuff. However, Fuji camera software will not work on internet-free computers. Obviously if all software applications follow this trend, the idea of keeping an ""internet free"" computer will be impossible, so I am hoping Fuji will repeal this consumer-unfriendly policy.On the bright side, the jpeg photos (the photos I can actually access on my computer-with-no-modem) seem nice."
4,Great solid camera,"I originally bought this camera for the 10x optical zoom as I do alot of range shots, and the assortment of features was very appealing.Since its purchase the camera has been superb in many aspects, great color with out much fuzzyness, decent to good battery life (I think I took 2 days of heavy use hmmmm maybe around 40-50 shots before the batteries got to low to function), and it was light weight.The only thing I might say that could possibly be taken as a negative is that you should get a tripod if you do not have a very steady hand. Although the camera does has a moderate anti-shake feature if you are not good at staying steady.... you can get some fuzzy shots but not many.I would difinately recommend this camera to my friends and others looking for a good camera."
5,BEST PURCHASE EVER!,"I have had this camera for about a year now. It was the best purchase ever! The zoom is incredible, and 4.0 megapixels is just perfect. The distance of the flash is great too! This is an incredible camera and is WELL worth the money! I have had no problems, or anything that has been negative about it whatsoever!"
1,The absolute WORST customer service!!!,The camera is fine as long as nothing goes wrong. Fuji has the worst customer service I have ever delt with. They pass you from one person to another and do everything they can not to help you. Be prepared to deal with the worst customer service in the business. I really hope this helps you.
5,Paydirt.Fuji hit paydirt with this one!,"This camera is nothing short of a mini marvel.Evidentually Fuji did some homework as the 3100 and 5100 take excellent pictures.The difference between the two lies in (you guessed it!) the features.The S3100 is a auto focus (point and shoot camera) while the S5100 is a auto focus (point and shoot)/manual camera.The s7000 has even MORE features than the S5100.The reason I spent the extra dollars and got the 5100 instead of the 3100 is simple.I like having the choice of switching auto everything off at times.Yeah I know there are Olympus digital cameras,Pentaxes,Kodaks,Sonys,Canons,JVCs and a bunch more but this camera has been good to me.P.S. Although they give you a complimentary 16MB XD card,I'd invest in at least a 256MB XD card and some rechargable batteries...but you knew that didn't you?"
2,looks robust but is flimsy,"I have had both the S5000 and the S5100 I was disapointed when my S5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months, but I was happy with the picture quality. I replaced it with the S5100, it has a slightly better feature set over the S5000 (in particular shutter speed choices) while on a trip to Niagara Falls, I was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt (and I mean slight) after that it wouldn't power up. I am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable."
3,Spanish Verb tables incomplete,"The product is what it is...BUT the product description said it had Spanish verb tables-and it does, but the tables are incomplete, in my opinion. So, if you are a student of Spanish and are hoping to use the verb tables for something more than basic tenses--well, that's not going to happen. You will still need to lug around your Spanish verbs book."
1,Etaco B3 patner and customer service,I purchased Etaco products and had some simple queries.The offered to give me some advise for a fee. Can you believe it. I have tried and tried to get on to them repeatedly with no response. Save your money and do not buy any of their products .their after sales service is nil out of 10
1,Piece of junk!,I bought a brand new torch. The top cap is sitting loose on the tank portion. Very cheap plastic construction and poorly designed and executed. Do not buy!!
5,Wife is a Kindergarten Teacher LOVES THIS ACTIVITIES BOOK!,"My wife bought this book to use in her kindergarten room. It has an enoumouse amount of activities and ideas. Plus, it has lots and lots of reproducibles. Activities from K through 5."
4,Entertaining story of the joys and anxieties of relationships,"Characters have great chemistry. Romance, fears of rejection, facing painful decisions from the past, very well developed. Less glamourous take on relationships; but more realistic. Facing fears, being honest about personal decisions from the past, grieving losses, make the story line believable and satisfying. good story without all the dark elements of many current movies. Recommend."
5,The Note ll: Taking a Chance on Love,She took a chance on love and found her Prince Charming. I think we are all afraid to take a chance on love but if we do not then we will never know what could have been. We could be missing out on something wonderful.
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge Genie Francis fan and have been for a very long time. I've collected most of what she has done and will continue to do so, however, found this movie less than appealing. It had a great story but the cast's acting was stunted and not her best work. Maybe it was the actors around her or the director, however, I've seen both actors and director's work before and just feel that they could have done better."
2,disappointed,I really enjoyed The Note - but was disappointed in The Note II. The first one offered a more conservative viewpoint but the second one had suggestive behavior and language that the first one did not have. They just didn't go together.
1,the note 2,I absolutely hated this movie. It has nothing to do with the book that the original movie was based on. It totally takes away the sweetness of the story.
1,Broken DVD!,"I love this movie and have seen it before, but it arrived broken. Hence, I was unable to view it."
5,It's really good,It's really a good movie. Genie Fransis Ted Mcginley & the rest of the cast are all terrific. I've enjoyedthis movie very much. I'm glad that I sent for it. thank you so much Donna Soldan
4,The Note II:,"The films The Note and The Note II are very pleasant family films, a nice glass of wine, a cheerful winters fire burning in the hearth and 2 films to sit, watch and relax with, what more could one ask for?"
5,Great Movie!,"This was a great movie. I already owned the first movie of the series so I wanted to see what happened next. It's a good, clean, family movie."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!,"I purchased this item so that i could travel from room to room without having to go wireless. Well, have you ever encountered a tangled phone cord? This item is 10 times worse! It is a big ball of nothing but , tangles, claiming to be snagless. I am running out to purchase a wireless router and be done with it. I wish i saved the box and receipt for it, i would have returned this piece of garbage."
4,Cat-5 cable,The cable is of good quality and had worked without problem. The terminations are easy to plug in and remove. There have been no performance issues with this cable.
5,Good Product,"I needed a cord to connect my desktop to my wireless internet port. I was a little skeptical at first because this product was so inexpensive. ""It must be cheap,"" I thought. Well, it's the same cord you would get at Office Depot or Staples but for a whole lot less. As a matter of fact, retail stores in general overprice CAT 5 cables. So all in all, I'd say this product exceeded my expectations."
5,Belkin Ethernet Cable,Really cheap and as good as the ones you could buy at Compusa or Bestbuy. Has had it for 2 mos and no problems so far. Great deal!
1,Vey discsatisfied with seller,"I ordered a 50 feet cable from the seller, however the first time the item arrived I got a 25 feet one. I reported this to amazon and was told that I should return the item and expect the correct product in a couple of weeks. I did this, however the second time the product arrived it was a 25 feet cable again.......!!!... I have shopped with Amazon in the past and it has been a good experience until now....but this incident has been quite irritating..."
1,What product?,"I can't review this product because even though I specifically ordered the 50 foot cable, they sent me a 25 foot one. The UPC is mislabeled on the back of the box, which is what causes this mix-up. Even after I sent the 25 foot one back and requested the 50 foot one that I ordered, they sent another 25 foot one."
5,Incredible Value,This cable is insanely cheap and does everything you could possibly need. I needed a cable long enough to run around the outside of my room and this was perfect. I was pleasantly surprised by the cost and have had not a single problem with it. Purchase without hesitation.
2,I received generic product from Sewell Direct.,"I ordered this cable from Sewell Direct. I received the cable in generic form. It was not packaged by Belkin. It did not say Belkin on the cable itself. It came in a plain plastic bag. My cable at home has Belkin imprinted on it, enclosed in Belkin packaging. I returned it to Sewell. They promptly refunded my full purchase total plus the return shipping costs. They should specify this generic or bulk packaging, so that I do not waste my time ordering from them."
5,ethernet cable 5e,The cable connected my computer with the blue ray dvd player to give me access to Netflix. It worked flawlessly.
5,HARD WIRE PLEASER,"There are cables, and then there are cables! If you're looking for a dependable way to extend the length of comcable between your high speed modem and your PC, this is an excellent choice. Belkin designed this Cat 5e baby for high speed transmission and equipped it with the proper RJ45, gold plated connectors at each end. Its a snap to hook up. All you have to be careful of is that you don't puncture or pinch the cable if you elect to secure it to a wall. There are plenty of proper cable fasteners for this that should be available at your local hardware store."
3,"Great smelling, but weak colors","My girlfriend bought me these after I had been talking about them constantly for a month. I love Mr. Sketch scented markers and when I found out Sanford was also making scented dry-erase markers, I was ecstatic. However, the colors are very faint when compared to regular Expo markers. You can hardly read them from more than a few feet away. Another minor gripe is that I didn't care that much for the smell of the black marker. I was hoping it was black licorice scented, but it's actually a mint chocolate smell. I ended up giving her the black marker because she enjoyed the smell of it and I kept the other three. The other three markers smell great!"
1,Leaky,"I got these to make my own cooking oil blend. Unfortunately they leak, so I'm back to research other brands."
3,It was good for my son's class,"My son's teacher requested that I purchase these. They worked properly and met our expectations. However, they were nothing out of the ordinary."
5,Arkhipova is pure magic!!,"This is the most romantic Nutcracker I have seen. The choreography is more adult than the ""spoiled little princess on world tour"" version one sees from the Royal Ballet and at regional ballets in the U.S. at Christmas time. Arkhipova and Mukhamedov seem to be enjoying themselves throughout the performance, with little of the artsy self consciousness you often see from older prima ballerinas (Arkhipova was 26 at the time this performance was filmed). Her dances with Mukhamedov are things of transcendent beauty.To my knowledge, this is the only DVD of Arkhipova's dancing available, and seeing her in action is well worth the price of admission. She combines extreme feminine grace and surprising power of movement with the most beautiful legs I have ever seen - a truly stunning vision."
5,Brilliant!,"A great story, and a wonderful taste of life in Australia for young kids.Mem Fox is just wonderful!"
5,Love the Poss!,"As an Australian, this book is especially loved by me and now a hit with my children as well. It has a great lesson and is a heartwarming story. Mem is a genius!"
1,Husband Convicted for Sexual Offence Against a Minor...,"... and she denied the charges, even after the conviction. You can draw your own conclusions about where that leaves her as a children's book author."
4,Cute book for little kids,"Very cute book, lovely illustrations. My kids loved this book when they were younger, so I bought it for my niece's little girl and she loves it too."
5,"Comprehensive approach for ""baby boomers""!!!","As a consultant pharmacist, specializing in women's health issues, I found Drs. Taylor's book one of the best, comprehensive, while easily understandable books that I have recently reviewed. I am dismayed to see this book listed currently as ""unavailable"" through Amazon, as I am now averaging 6 recommendations of this title to my patients daily. Amazon, you best order more copies!!!!"
5,Lifesavers,"Thank you SO MUCH for sharing. You have immensely added to the quality of my life by helping to improve my health. You are tactful, understanding, and patient. Now it all makes sense. I've been in the healtcare field since 1984 and have had many doctors but none like you. Integrative medicine is the way to go! Your admonitions really work!!"
4,Learning Why I Feel The Way I Do,"This book took me beyond the answer to its question, with information on how to make a difference in my health. With its clinical approach, I felt I was no longer just the patient, but a person empowered with understanding of the chemical makeup of my body. Thankfully, no food plans or diet recipes are included in this book, only information on how to correct a hormonal imbalance that has been plaguing me for fourteen years. Learning is more than half the battle when I can easily implement changes in my lifestyle!"
2,No wonder the author used a pen name,"This book is an embarassment; the kind of thing an adolescent would write if he knew all the words. It is rife with minor technical errors that really spoil the flow and much of the slang is years out of date and completely wrong for the age of the main character. The characters are comic book sterotypes - the hero is a big macho guy, a cop who is a rebel against the system and who was a special forces soldier and speaks fluent Russian and who has a young hot, randy girlfriend - ugh!! The plot, while plausible I guess, is nothing special.Give me a break. I quit reading at page 151 and went on to read something by a better author."
2,Talky and violent,"THE BITE starts violently, ends violently, and has lots of violence in between. It's a cold, tough-talking book, with the f-word the first choice for all parts of speech. It's so talky, in fact, that it's hard to consider it a real thriller-more a mystery with a high body count. I was drawn to read THE BITE because of its setting, the suburban Towson-Cockeysville area north of Baltimore with which I thought I was familiar. But I didn't find much that was recognizable, or compelling. The book flap identifies ""Michael Crow"" as a pseudonym for ""a prize-winning, critically acclaimed literary novelist whose works have been translated and published in nine languages."" Maybe he was too embarrassed to use his real name for this one."
4,Interesting -,"Provides views of a number of Charles Dickens' haunts and homes, as well as background on his life, even from an early age. Dickens' books (and the subsequent DVDs made from them) provide an incredible insight into life in early/middle 1880s England."
1,very dangerous toolThis tool,This tool is very dangerous. there are no safety measures in place with this tool such as blade gaurds or an automatic brake. Would never use this tool let alone own one.
4,dense packed with cliche's,"The first time you listen this album seems to rip off everything from the hair metal era, because it basically is. After a few listens though, the songs are pretty decent. ""In yer face"", ""dont wanna cry no more"", ""peasure and pain"" have that hair metal swaggger and are memorable after the album ends. out. It falls down when they rip off the bad elements of the 80, like the crappy ballad ""Forever"" the cowboy ballad ""Ride Cowboy"" and the sleazy ""Take me"" that goes on far too long. Good 80's vibe album if you can find it for a low price. Check out their video on you tube also."
3,Mr. Fantastic,"I thought this tou would stretch like rubber, but it does not. It only has like extension that pull out. Not quite like the cartoon. But it's OK."
5,A delight for all ages,"This is a lovely book that I've given to children and adults the past 2 Christmases.While not as intellectually rigorous as Sophie's World and not quite as captivating as The Solitaire Mystery (which you must, must read), The Christmas Mystery is more addictive than a bag of peanuts. Rarely have I found a book that appeals to children and adults alike -- but this one does.Even if you have no background or real interest in Advent and Christmas, this book's fresh perspective will still delight."
3,Not one of Gaarder's best works,"Jostein Gaarder ranks right up there on my list of favorite authors, but I did not feel that this was his best effort. It is very much in the same vein of ""The Solitaire Mystery"" (my all-time favorite book) and ""Sophie's World"" (the book that inspired me to get a philosophy minor in college), but covers the same principles talked about in ""Solitaire Mystery"". Read that one to get your socks blown off, read ""The Christmas Mystery"" around December to get in the spirit of the holidays!"
