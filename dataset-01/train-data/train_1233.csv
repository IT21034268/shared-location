5,The Dead Just Keep On Walkin',"I am not really into gore or zombies...I kinda of see them as a means to the end when it comes to an apocolyptic story. But, since watching the the Walking Dead series....I have never been fascinated with plot and story line. most excellent writers, actors, and directores...well done :-)"
4,great doomsday tv,"Love the suspense, and the drama. Very good zombie costume, and acting. You really help them run from the walkers !"
5,Made a fan out of me.,i remember i used to hate anything zombie. This was mostly because back then anything zombie normally sucked. However after buying the first season of walking dead purely out of curiosity i became enthralled with the show. Now a year later i am looking forward to the release of the second season come august 28
5,cool,great stuff. exactly what it said it was . this is the crown jewel of the walking dead season blu rays
4,Daryl .. enough said ..,"I would just put the name Daryl and leave it as that but Amazon wants more words, so here it goes. This is a delightfully fun series, not perfect, but how can anything in a 'zombie world' be perfect? The acting is good, story line fun, although a couple of the characters are whinny which can be irritating but overlooking that .. its just a fun series. And the best character in my book is Daryl .. Norman was great as a saint and even greater as a zombie killer. As always Amazon was on time with pkg. and price was right."
5,Still the best show on cable,"For as long as I can remember this is the best show ever on cable and the only thing on tv worth watching these days. Amazing uncut, brilliant show."
1,Another Good Show RUINED,I CANT BELIEVE THE DIRECTION THEY WENT WITH SEASON 2.When i first saw Season 1 i thought that this was tahe best Show on the planet and i actually but all the episodes. I even recommended it to my friends but now sadly regret it...I agree with other comments which says that the show is Flaming Out badly. I will not buy no more show episodes. I dont even watch TV that much and now i can honestly say that im not buying no more shows. I agree with Igorr..and L P...they shouldnt have fired they star director. Now this show is like watching ALL MY CHILDREN drama filled and less action...AMC u guys know how to ruin a good show.
4,Zombies are fun!!!,"This show is more than your average zombie shoot'em up. It focuses on the characters and their struggle to survive in a post apocalyptic world. However, if you really are not into zombies then this show will not be for you as it does have a lot of gory zombie killing in it. Overall, I think that this is a good show and lots of fun for the whole family(as long as you don't have young children or don't mind that they have nightmares)."
2,No SUBTITLE,No Subtitle for special feature. I would give it 5 stars if they provide me A SUBTITLE! I want to see web video and delete scenes but there is no subtitle for it.
4,Timetrooper,"Was great cant wait for the next season to come out . If you like this genre , this is for you ."
3,Meh.,Season 1 was a lot better. Although you can't go to the next season without seeing this one...just too many important plot developments.
5,TWD 2nd time around...,"As many already know, I am a HUGE fan of TWD. If you've ever seen it, you know it's more than good.Season2 is filled with twists, turns and flesh-chewing goodness. The story goes straight to the bone ;-)The stellar SFX and makeup remain and the cast is as good as ever.Camera work and the set(s) are top notch like always.Buy Season1, buy this Season2, watch them, love them; trust me - you will!Easily 5*"
2,I'm Snoring,"Okay, it's a T.V. series. We can't expect Dawn of the Dead action every single episode, but here we are watching this soap opera garbage this far into the season and I gotta tell you I am bored. Too slow, too drawn out. I love the show, love the concept, love that a zombie series finally made it to cable, but for christ sake get on with some action. We should only be seeing the drama crap in flashbacks. If things don't change I predict a cancellation and no season three. Give us 3 good epidsodes of action before you give us more characture development episodes please!!!!"
2,HD quality issues,"While the show is fantastic, it's the HD quality that lowers my rating. Other streaming outlets, HULU and NetFlix work fantastic on my computer, but Amazon videos show in poor quality and always show a poor connection. The HD on NetFlix remains fantastic, as seen on the first season of this show, but the second season through Amazon is poorer quality than anything. And that is when viewed in succession, not at different times, same settings, same conneciton speeds through the router.I'm eager to see what happened but I won't pay for HD quality, or even low quality, to view it as large pixels and stop-gap screenshots."
5,What a wonderful service!,I am so happy that I discovered Amazon DVDs on demand! It was so easy to download these DVDs and they are available anytime I want to watch them. I did not have to go from store to store trying to find the entire season 2 of Walking Dead. Season 2 of Walking Dead is really good. If you liked season 1 you will like season 2. I highly recommend both the service of downloading the dvds from Amazon and the season 2 series of Walking Dead.[...]
4,More than just zombies,Good story line. Walking Dead is about more than just killing zombies. It's more about the human will to survive and just how far one would go to protect the ones you love. Would we sacrifice our humanity. Good episode. Looking forward to season 2.
5,Cherokee Rose,This program is awesome. The acting is 1st class. The drama between the people is as expected; unexpected.What else can go wrong? Who knows. The fun part of this show is that you never know what to expect.Great actors down to the kids too! I hope to see a Season III very soon. I don't have cable; too expensive. Paying $1.99 per episode is great. Better than a $7.00 movie; once a month. I can see (4) episodes a month!
5,great show,must have for any walking dead fan. no better way to spend a super cold weekend of no work. ZOMBIE MARATHON
4,Say what?!,"Am I the only one, or did anyone else notice on the episode info that it says, ""Starring: Aretha Franklin"" ??? Huh, who knew?"
4,Item de colección para fans,"Le hubiese dado un 5 perfecto si solo estuviese opinando sobre el show, pero la evaluación es sobre el producto en conjunto. La cabeza no es tan perfecta como pensaba, la calidad no es como algunas figuras de acción que a uno lo dejan impresionado, pero tampoco esta mal, para nada. Un simpático ítem colección mas un show adictivo en calidad blu-ray a un precio decente. Estoy contento con la compra."
3,excellent show,I would like to review this as a 5 star but my blu case was almost completely broken and the discs were loose with all of the broken plastic. Thankfully the broken pieces did not scratch the discs. This is a great show and I would like to rate higher but the quality the product arrived is unacceptable.
3,Not as good as season 1,"I LOVED season 1 of this show, and raved about how great it was.I was disappointed by season 2. Apparently they fired the producer from season 1 and maybe some of the writers too?Not sure, but the dialog is terrible here.The Blu-Ray looks and sounds great as expected."
2,Annoying,"I feel like the series morphed from horror to drama with gore. I am disliking the characters more, I feel yucky somehow. I felt cleaner after watching the resident evil movies. I don't know if I want to see any more now."
3,From The Walking Dead to The Walking Dull,"Season 1 was absolutely awesome, and I could hardly wait for Season 2 to start.What really got me about the first season is the mix of a human drama with a little zombie apocalypse - lots of tension without relying on gore. Season 2 ... I'm seriously 1 or 2 more yawners away from canceling my season pass. I can not believe how long they drug out this whole Sophia missing / life on the farm thing. Each episode seems to have about 1 interesting thing occur, with about 40 minutes of filler. And to be honest, I wouldn't mind the filler if it was helping establish a character, but it fails to do even that. We still know very little about any of the character's past; we still know extremely little about the events that lead up to the apocalypse or how far it's even spread. It's starting to feel like AMC is living into the title of the show and is delivering something dead on its feat."
5,the walking dead season 1and 2,If you are into zombie movies or the undead then this series should be right down your alley.Myself i think it is one of the better series created
5,Great way to start the season!,"I enjoyed seeing exactly how this world is changing these characters and how they are collecting spare parts,fuel,food, etc from the cars.It is a shame to see that some cars on the road are not being collected but that is most likely to the fact that the keys are not in the vehicle. If you are a fan of the zombie genre then I would higly recommend this as it is both enjoyable and realistic."
5,Love this series!,Love this series. Great storyline. Hope it stays on for a long time! Reading the comics to the show I've never been dissapointed!
5,Another excellent episode.,"I'm catching back up right now on the series. This episode was my latest on that journey. I enjoyed it. I was thrilled with the farm scene, and Rick's wife makes some really stupid choices considering how intelligent she is represented as being, but those are minor gripes. Regarding the latter, it seemed obvious that her latest mishap was written in to bring about the end of her pregnancy. Dunno yet though. The bar though, that's really where this episode was at. I felt it did a great job at showing how despondent and hopeless things can seem. It also showed that regardless of circumstances, there are just simply some good people and some bad ones. Rick reclaimed some of his swagger there. Also, i really loved that they closed the episode with ""Regulator"" by Clutch. That is by far one of my all time favorite songs.Enjoy!"
4,It was exactly what my brother wanted.,This was a gift for my brother and he seemed to like it. I don't know if he has had a chance to watch it yet.
5,Season 2 of a great series!,"Season 2 of the best TV show since LOST.More of a great thing. Looks and sounds great. Even if you don't like Zombies, give it a shot. It's worth it."
4,Walking dead season 2,Excellent show. Gets a repetitive but what else can you expect with zombies?I bought the entire season. Good watching.
5,So glad I got one,My family and I are HUGE fans of THE WALKING DEAD and this is sooooo much better then the picture shows. I am ordering another one to use as movie book ends ;-)
2,BEWARE! The Season 2 Sp. Ed. might be released 2 months later!,"I was one of the idiots who bought the original DVD release of TWD Season 1, only to have them release a Special Edition of Season 1 a few months later!! So, wouldn't it make sense to NOT buy this and wait for the 2nd release of the Special Edition of Season 2?"
2,episode nine blows,"the ending of episode 9 was predictable and very poorly written. the writer sure wasn't being too creative there. overall the episode gets a grade of 'E"" for lacking creativity and substance in the script and writing and final presentation."
2,Still Boring,"Such a let down after the mid season finale last year. The first three-quarters of this episode was as exciting as watching ditchdiggers work. Literally. The characters are still endlessly pontificating their roles and society's new woes. Not to get anyone's hopes up, the last fifteen minutes aren't exactly great, but at least something happens. It's even believable, albeit out of character, and thankfully, much needed."
3,The Walking Dead Season 2,The show constantly would buffer and skip. I like the idea of instant video just not the quality. I would buy again just maybe not in HD.
5,Awesome,Great season. The head is well detailed. Great collectors item. Amazons prices are the best out there! I would def recommend for anyone that likes the walking dead
5,TWD season 2,same as season 1. Just awesome! You really can't ask for something more scary than this zombie story. The Characters are fantastic!
5,"Finally, show seems to get back on track",Great episode and what you've been wanting since the first season. This seems to be a pivotal point (hopefully more to come) for the characters.
5,Inspirational and Enjoyable,"Inspired by their senior pastor's warning that ""far too many black people are digging their graves with their teeth,"" the congregation of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, one of the oldest African-American churches in the country, has pulled together a slew of delectable recipes that will give new meaning to the words ""soul food."" With contributions from renowned restaurants like Sylvia's, Londel's and Brian Washington-Palmer's Native, ""Food for the Soul"" also entertains with stories about the church serving the local community.A beautiful book that is both inspirational and enjoyable."
4,"""Phantasmagoric Quality""","Snippets of life in rural Soviet Russia with a raw phantasmagoric quality that is often elusive and difficult to pin down. This subtitled film opens with a somewhat conventional and interesting storyline of a wayward truck driver, but ultimately gives way to lot of shifting scenes where shifty characters predominate.Nonethelessss, one is given a great visual window into the unforgiving wintry tundra and the feral, primitive villagers living in an authoritarian but nonethess lawlass state. This film is obviously not for the faint hearted given recurrent themes of brutality, thievery, cruelty and misanththopy. I should add that it was difficult to keep track of the comings and goings of this rather large cast which otherwise did dispaly exceptional acting skills."
2,I love foreign films but not this one,"I watch at least one foreign film a week and like movies from all over the world. This one, however, was just strange. It was just too difficult to follow. Not only were parts of the movie almost impossible to see because the screen was so dark (and I watched it on a big flat screen HD TV), but characters just kept popping up out of no where and I couldn't tell what happened to the original main character who got lost in the woods in the beginning.I gave it two stars instead of one because some of the dialogue is very funny in a dry humor way and some of the scenes surprise you with an unexpected (though usually deadly) twist. But two stars is all I can give - this movie just wasn't for me."
2,It's a mystery...,"why this book has almost five stars! I found the dialogue annoyingly stilted, the characters idiotic, and the plot uninspired. There are a lot better mystery and suspense authors out there, such as Lisa Scottoline, Jonathan Kellerman, and Jeffrey Deaver."
2,Heard this story before,"This story is the same as the ""I know what you did last Summer"" Same storyline, same ending. I was kind of disapointed."
4,In the Event of My Death,"This is one of the best books I have read. I like murder mysteries and this one delivers!!!! Murder, mystery, supense and sex all rolled up in one. Hope you like it as mujch as I did."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I liked this book, but not as much as I expected I would.Pros: The characters were all interesting and complex. It was an original idea for a book. There were plenty of twists and turns.Cons: A slow start and a weak ending. The murder's identity turned out to be a surprise, but I thought that he/she was a poor choice to be the killer."
5,A Great Suspense Thriller G.L pd 1,"This book was very suspenseful and dramatically written.I didn't want to stop reading it.It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading it .This book kept me wondering who the killer of the remining six of hearts was until the very end.And even when I found out I was so surprised I didn't believe it.The author did a tremendous job keeping you in the book and making you you feel like you are a character in the story, and you can feel all the different emotions they are going through. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I would definately read it again."
4,4 STAR READ-NOT GREAT but PRETTY GOOD,"Comes in a little long, but with so many murders it has to be a little longer than some. Interesting characters and keeps you guessing until you are ready for the ""grand finale"". You may not guess the ending even if you are a dyed in the wool fan of mysteries. Worth the price--given 4 stars because only the perfect ones rate a five stars from this lifelong reader."
1,Not Impressed,Not impressed. Won't stand on own. Product is filled with foam inside and is unfinished on the bottom. I was going to send it back but it's not worth the return shipping and time.
3,Cheap decoration,"I bought this to place into a wedding gift for my cousin as a joke. For only a couple of bucks, why not?The quality is terrible, which I had expected. They do have a difficult time standing on their own, and the bottoms were already coming off when I received them in the mail."
5,Neo-noir Jazz,"Subterranean Jazz's second album (following their brilliant eponymous debut in 1999) shows the band expanding their melodic grooves to include a panache of latin rhythms, complex harmonic structures, and creative songcraft. The elements of the group --guitar, stand-up bass, drums, and saxophone -- blend beautifully with each other to create a cohesive, smooth machine. Each musician gets many opportunities to shine both musically and compositionally on this record, most notably saxophonist Tom Clohessy, whose mellifluous playing on such standouts as the Indian-flavored ""Azahar"" and ""Santa Cruz Postcard"" exhibits a clear understanding of the kind of noir-jazz that brings to mind the era of 1950s. Although an instrumental record, Subway Sonnets carries the listener on a wave of word pictures -- rain slicked streets, a dank nightclub, dim neon, and bourbon on the rocks..."
5,simple. superb. soulful.,"I can't put this CD on without someone asking me how to get their hands on it. People LOVE it. I gave this CD as a gift to many friends this year, and they were really, truly grateful. After (Or at) a hard day's work, place it in the box and let the troubles dissolve."
4,Definitive Edition Packaging,"Regarding the packaging on this ""definitive edition""; the original CD release had an awkward looking botch job of a cover since artist Peter Saville didn't license the artwork for any release besides the original LP. After what I'm assuming were some sort of negotiations, we now have this improved edition, and I purchased the CD a second time to get the original art. I must alert readers to the fact that the artwork on the back of the original LP - another austere and striking Saville design - is missing in action. Since most of the bonus tracks are on the previous CD, and the booklet contains next to nothing, I'd say this edition is a ripoff."
5,Rage in Eden ~ Ultravox,"Listening now to Ultravox I have no idea why I did not listen to them during the 80's. I also wish that I could have seen them live since Midge Ures vocals are amazing and he is also a brilliant lyricist. This being the second album with Ure as the vocalist is just as good as the previous album, i.e., Vienna and contains amazing tracks such as the thin wall, the voice and proves that they are not some flash in the pan. This is a brillaint album."
3,"Not there best,but still a decent overall album","After listening to this cd i am a little unsure of how i feel about it.I have had several other cd's buy this band and i can say this is not there best work.Don't get me wrong,this is not a terrible cd,there are some decent points to this cd,but there is also some things that just make you say what the heck was that about?I guess after de mysteris dom sathanas you just expect more from these guys.Kind of makes you wonder if this is the last we will hear from this band,and if they should ever release another cd,what kind of effort will these guys put in to it?"
2,What a dissapointment?,"Let me just say I was feeling on top of the world when I heard that Attila was back to do vocals. Not because I didn't like Maniac, I did. But a variation to the traditional theme sounded interesting.Then I got the CD. I am sorry, but badly recorded CDs drive me insane. NO, this is not ""I am in the woods and its freaking cold and I feel evil"" kind of recording. It's just a bad recording. Each song has a different mix and in some songs the drums sound like someone is banging on a tin cup. Horrible. I am sure these songs had potential. But they completely ruined it by trying to sound like ""the TrueMayhem"". Let the music speak for itself...oh and by the way Da Mysteriis had a decent even recording. Bottom Line: I can't hear the music and Hellhammer's drums are truly horrible sounding.I gave up on the 4th attempt."
2,"Uninspiring, dumb, disappointing","This album is absolutely horrible. Production sounds like something recorded in a basement with a boom box. Guitars are out of tune and boring. Lots of nonsensical tempo changes. Drums are nothing special, which is odd because Hellhammer is a very talented drummer, he is capable of a lot more. Vocals are about the only thing I like here, Atilla sounds very ""necro"", which is why I'm giving it two stars. I would only recommend this album to a die hard Mayhem fan like me. Otherwise get ""Grand Declaration of War"" or ""De Misteriis Dom Sathanas"", these are true Mayhem classics."
2,Produced in the toilet...,"I'm a Mayhem fan, I waited for this CD eagerly. I bought it. It sounds like [..]. I don't feel the need to kiss their butts so much as to give them a 4 or 5 star rating. This album sounds like it was recorded in the garbage can. If it didn't sound so crappy I would maybe give it 4 stars. The music is good. Don't buy this CD, Wait and see if they release a REMASTERED copy or something. This CD is a huge let down. Shame on you Mayhem!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,The True Mayhem??,Mayhem needs to start thinking about how they used to sound then how they could sound. From a black metal stand point with other black mental bands to listen to People should pass this one up. Sure Mayhem is one of the bands who started this way of life but the One who started it all is gone and he was mayhem. Since De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas Mayhem has been slowly been putting themselves out. Sure they have Hellhammer on drums but who in Norway doesnt have Hellhammer on drums. I bought cause I am a fan of Mayhem and will support them for that. People looking to get into blackmetal buy De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas if you are wanting to experience the True Mayehm
4,"If your into Mayhen , Get it","It's a pretty good album, I'm glad I got it, there are some real heavy moments but to much of that slow musical orchestra sounding S**t that leaves you waiting for the Kill!Definetly not the best Mayhem but certainly a bit differant!"
2,No Help,The product fit well but in three months oil began to seep thru the seals again. This has been a continuing problem for PT Cruisers.
3,Nice Read,"This book was a nice read. There was nothing phenomonal about it,just a relaxing and easy read. The book is full of adventure but not worth buying. I would have checked it out from the library. There are too many slow parts in the book. A lot of dead time and it's very predictable. Nothing jumps out at you that makes you want to read on."
1,Temperature Sensor Doesn't Work,"Unfortunately, I purchased this product for the temperature gauge. It doesn't work at all. In warm bathwater, it lists the temperature as 115 degrees F and in cold water, 103 degrees F - not terribly useful. Perhaps the alarm feature is useful - I have not tested that feature. I wish I had kept the packaging so that I could return it..."
3,Great gift for kids,"If you are buying this thinking you'll see WWE Divas in seductive & sexy clothing you'll be ripped off. But if you are buying this for a teenage son who loves the girls of the WWE, then this is the calendar for them. The sexiest photos in the whole calendar are featured on the cover. No revealing photos at all."
1,I wanted this review to be better,"I read Money Making Marketing and loved it. For the most part I have found Lant to be very good at getting his point across and providing good information you can use. Unfortunately, with ""How to Make a Whole Lot More than 1,000,000 (& etc)"" he talks down to the reader incessantly and he offers very little in the way of substance. I cannot tell you how many times I have tried to wade through this book and found that I just can't. I wanted to like this book, the subject matter is near and dear to my heart. However, Lant needs to focus on the subject hand, follow his own advice and give the customer what they want. People buy this book because they want clear, step-by-step advice on how to produce a product that they can sell. I am no different than anyone else in that I want that real how-to advice. Lant completely fails to provide at all tangible in that area. Save your money and bypass this book."
1,I have a better marketing strategy,"I suppose you could find some useful information in this book if you have the time and the patience to sift through the nauseating verbosity the author is so good at. Personally, I had neither. So I just went for a walk and had an absolutely phenomenal idea that worked right away. The more books we read, the less time we have to do what we really want to do. Life is short. Just focus on a genuine product or service you want to provide and a perfect marketing strategy will be prompted from within."
1,Bad reproduction,"I do not recommend this Nabu reproduction of Cieza de Leon's The War of Chupas. Whoever scanned it from the original book did not have the equipment set correctly and apparently did not check on what was being reproduced. On the majority of the pages, starting with the Table of Contents, the top of each page has a nice, wide margin, and the lowest line on the page is partially or completely missing. In some cases, this removes or blurs footnotes; in others, it's the last line of the text that's missing."
5,Roger Thorpe ~ The Scandal Years {Guiding Light},I love going back and seeing Roger and Holly. The man behind Roger was a great actor.
4,Definitely worth the money,Sacha is a genius. Ali G is up to his old stuff--incredibly interviewing luminaries of American politics and media and more incredibly they don't get it's a joke.But Borat steals the show. Sacha's fumbling foreign atler-ego gets the biggest laughs.It was great the first time through and some of the bonus material was funny too (like Ali's Harvard keynote speech). But it doesn't warrant repeat viewings--which is fine because the first time is worth every penny.
4,Da Ali G Show,"Irreverent and funny, Sacha Baron Cohen strikes back even better with the second season of Da Ali G show."
5,Dad and Me in the Morning,"As a Deaf person myself, I was pleased with the positive imagines in this work. This is an excellent book based on the relationship between a deaf child and his father. It displayed the father's acceptence of his child's need for ASL (American Sign Language) and the williness and time to learn it. It is also a good way to introduce the rudiments of Deaf culture to the general public. It should be recommended reading for all - including hearing children. The watercolor illustrations and the context within work together beautifully and was well recieved by students at Gallaudet University (a liberal arts university for the deaf/hard of hearing students."
5,Dad and Me in the Morning,Early in the morning a young boy sneaks into his father's room and awakens him so that they go to their special spot to watch the sunrise over the lake. The young boy is deaf but has many ways of communicating with his father. They have an extraordinarily strong father-son relationship.The illustrations are beautifully done and show the acceptance of other ways to communicate. I would strongly recommend this book to children between the ages of 4-8. The simplistic way of introducing the subject of people being different(people with disabilities)has been covered sensitively.
2,OK,This book shows you how to write the Kana and provides some exercises to help you on the path. The best way is to just write the Kana on and on (of course following the rules of writing them).
4,The Kite rider,"This book takes us back into the 13th century in China with the point of view from a boy named Hoayuo. After waching his beloved father, Pie, die. Hoayou's life is filled with misery, but more trouble comes when a Di Chou, the person who killed Hoayuo's father by making him test the wind for a long journey, shows up and gets proposed to Hoayou's lonely and widowed mother. Afterwards Hoayuo gets engaged with kites and starts making some for money for his family. Hoayuo is then noticed by the noble Maio Jeand his circus. Maio invites Hoayuo to be his circuses kite rider. Then the evil, Kublai Khan strikes and gets trouble in Hoayuo's journey.This book is absalutely great for time passing and entertaining. You really get the images and pictures in your mind once you start reading this book. So take a look at this book, and start reading it, because you will want to read the story."
4,teacher,I was trying to find a book that would interest both boys and girls. The Kite Rider fit the bill. The story is emotional and exciting. The decriptions in the book can help students make a picture of the story. It has just enough history and culture that teachers can suppliment their lessons with the book. My students like the book better than reading the text book.
1,"Don't expect much. Sorry, don't expect anything.","There is no zero stars. That's the only reason for one star. Bill Wilson of Wilson Combat goes through the motions on this DVD about Glocks. At least that is what you think you are getting. Only a third of the video is directed towards the gun. The beginning is about basic shooting skills. Next is cleaning the gun, but it only covers basic field cleaning. Next he pitches his own cleaners oils and lubes. That's right I paid a lot for things that either come with the owners manual of the gun, by watching people shoot at the range, or watching late night infomercials. Also, I know he is a wonderful craftsman, but he is as boring as a librarian. Do not buy this video. It is horrible."
1,Glock: how to shoot by Bill Wilson,Very disapointed in the purchase. When reading what the DVD was SUPPOSE to cover I thought I was getting a DVD for more accurate shooting and helpful tips but it turned out to be an informercial on his products. I was looking for a DVD to help me learn to shoot better and tips for better accuracy and did not get either. Do not buy! Was a waste of money!
2,Don't bother,Not much in this video. They did it mostly to advertise their own lubricating oil. Better info in Building The Ultimate Glock by Lenny Magill.
4,Descent DVD,"Bill Wilson does a pretty good job in this video. He goes over proper grip, stance, aiming, field stripping the glock, maintenance & cleaning, and finally lubrication. He really tries to sell his products which is okay except he took the last 15 minutes (maybe more) to compare his lubricants to others. Overall I found it interesting and watched it from start to finish."
5,"Large, visually appealing book","I bought this book for Christmas for my elderly uncle. I personally thought the book looked very nice. The pictures are large and a nice quality. But the true value of the book was determined by my uncle. He was in WWII himself, so the man knows his stuff. He opened the present and was immediately thrilled with it. He started reading it and looking through it right away, unable to wait through the rest of the present opening. The pictures were large enough that even though his eye sight is now quite poor, he could see and enjoy the book. We continued opening present and he was totally immersed in the book. Other relatives tried to get him to open his presents from them, and he actually told them no, he was busy reading this book I got him! It is an excellent present for any WWII buff. If you have a history fan on your Christmas list, someone you have no idea what to purchase for, buy him this. I had no idea it could possibly make my uncle this happy."
4,Pale and pretty,"When I first received these earrings in the mail, I was confused--I couldn't remember ordering any earrings that looked like diamonds. It took me a minute to remember that I'd ordered blue topaz, and to see the pale blue shining in these drop earrings. It reminds me of sea glass made from old Coke bottles, but a bit more faint. The drop is almost the size of a #2 pencil eraser. Overall, I've decided I like them, even though I was expecting something more colorful."
5,Daft Punk In General,"I have been listening to Daft Punk for a while i have all their groovy electro-pop albums. I'm telling you if your into electronic-house music these guys are the best!!!!! Homework is a great album Fresh is my favorite song, but all of the stuff is my favorite their beats are hypnotyzingly phenominal. television Rules The Nation is my alltime favorite, I Love Daft Punk. if you have iTunes download a song or if you have limewire just listen to them and you'll be crazed by their awesome rythms"
2,i love daft punk but.....,"daft punk ARE my favourite dJs of all time... they come out of nowhere and have infectious songs that you canno get out of the head... this LP is just a remix album of their 2001 classic DISCOVERY. but it does nothing for me really....i am feelin the 'aerodynamik' (daft punk remix)....I LOVE THE NEPTUNES but, their remix to one of my favourite songs of all time 'harder better faster stronger' is just terrible.... they should have never touched it at all...sorry neptunes...the other remix by jess& crabbe us way better.this album should have had more songs from their album... they are missing 'superheros', 'queis-vous', and 'voyager' some of the best tracks on the DISCOVERY album.....this album has the same song just remix... aerodynamik has 3 remixes (2 too many), they should have left 'something about us' ALONE....i love daft punk but please come with new material so i could forgive you for this dreadful piece..."
3,Daft Punk - Daft Club,"Daft Punk's Discovery gets put through the ringer by some house and hip-hop luminaries. The resulting album, Daft Club, shows a wild range --- lots of fun. The Neptunes turn ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" into a R&B track, while Basement Jaxx throw whatever sonic debris they can get their hands (from Arabic horn samples to vocal squeals) into their mix of ""Phoenix."" Boris Dlugosh, however, doesn't do much for ""Digital Love."" Both Demon and Laidback Luke deliver harder versions of ""Face To Face"" and ""Crescendolls"" respectively, but the Slum Village version of Aerodynamic minimizes the wonderful baroque chords and maximizes not-so-wonderful broke rhymes. And just in case you didn't get enough of ""One More Time,"" there's an acoustic version. Definitely a mixed bag of a remix album, but still worth checking out."
1,very lousy remix album,"The only good remix album I've ever heard is Beck's Guero album remixed, but this CD is just plain awful. Daft Punk's original songs were perfect, but on this disc they are changed into bland techno melodies. The only good song on here is the one with the internet dial-up connection sound, but the rest are boring mixes. Don't buy this, buy the band's groundbreaking debut and then check out their other stuff."
3,"Could live without the most, but still allright","Daft punk is my favorite techno group, it's been a few years since their last album now so i thought they would release a new one soon. I don't know if this should be considered as ""new"" cause this is a album full of remixes, some pleasant but some pretty bad. Only new songs are ""OUVERTURE"" whih is actually very good, but too short. Then the ballad ""Something about us"" for Interstella 5555 and ""Aerodynamite"". I do like some of the remixes here ""The Neptunes"" and ""Basement Jaxx"" are 2 of the remixing groups on the album. But i could live without the terrible rap version of Aerodynamic and the slow motion version of One more time. If you have their last album you haven't missed much, unless you're one of those huge fans that want every single version of every possible single. Remixed rarely makes the songs better in my oppinion. A decent album anyway, but i hope they will make a new one soon that will sound like they used to do."
2,"For every good track, theres 3 bad ones","The reason this CD made me so mad, is that i was expecting so much from it.Homework is one of my favorite albums of all time, and Discovery blew my mind when i first heard it.Both get listened to all the time.Areodynamite is decent. Neptunes remix is CRAP. Basement Jaxx remix (and this made me REALLY upset, as the B-Jaxx are ANOTHER one of my favs) is CRAP. The remix of Digital Love is basically Digital Love with a couple added drums and extended parts. Same song. Slum Village remix was okay. Unplugged remix of One More Time is a joke. It has to be.I dont remember any other song as being even noteworthy.It breaks my heart, but this CD is definately not worth owning."
2,BIG disappointment,"Not very good. Not nearly what it could have been. There are maybe 4 good tracks on the whole cd. The rest are complete crap. It pains me to write this review because I'm a huge fan, but I haven't even had this cd for a day and I'm already tired of it."
4,"Some fun new stuff, but the new live recordings are weak","This is all in all a good album for any fan of the New Jersey crew, especially for those that missed out on the ""Alone in the Crowd"" Bonus EP. The CD includes two brand new recordings, all the songs from the previous ""Washed Up"" EP (Including the hidden live songs, which are now tracks), the ""Alone in the Crowd"" EP mentioned above as well as whole slew of live recordings!!Unfortunately, the new live recordings are the ""bad"" part of this CD, the sound quality on some of them is mediocre at best, and sometimes it's hard to even make things out.All of the songs are fun though, especially the hip hop styled ""No Love for the Roadie,"" and the new recorded songs show alotta promise.A good CD to pick up for anyone that's a Catch 22 fan, but I have to give it a four out of five because of the poor quality on the new live tracks"
2,what happened?,"Keasby Knights was a great CD, but this one just isn't worth your money. There are one or too good songs on the CD, but the rest.... just save your money, and if your looking for a good CD buy Keasbey Nights to hear Catch 22 at its best."
4,SO SO,"I respect Catch 22 a lot, they are one of my favorite bands and I believe the CD is good, but the quality on the live recordings could be A LOT better. Other than that the songs are great. I'd recommmend getting Keasbey Nights if you want to hear Catch 22 at it's best. Peace out. Enjoy your ska listening."
3,Not Catch 22's best work,"This is a very OK cd. I think if you like more punk/ska Alone In A Crowd and this one are for you. But if you like the more ska type stuff get Keasbey Nights, its Catch 22 at its best no matter what kind of ska you like."
4,Good for Bossa Chops,"This is a typical Jamey Aeborsold product, i.e., nice selection of tunes, well-recorded cd, nice rhythm section. My only concern is that I would haved preferred a few more slower-tempo tunes. No biggie, this is a very nice collection."
3,Universal fit?,"The set was supposed to fit a 5.8 Ford truck. Part number and application included 5.0 Ford engine also. Wrong! The cap fits great, Accel products are usually good, but the rotor would not fit on the shaft. I ended up using the cheapo one that was on the truck already. Nice cap though."
3,"Insightful and emotional, more ""feel"" than ""food""","Good book, very valuable when trying to emotionally support a child with a weight problem. The book includes tips on getting the family involved in healthy activities, how to allow your child to express their feelings without criticism, and how to overcome obstacles in the classroom, organized sports, and with friends - and how labelling a child can be harmful - overweight is a condition your child may have, but not necessarily ""is"". There wasn't a lot of helpful dietary information, and I feel there was a little apathy on part of the authors, an attitude of acceptance of overweight as long as the child doesn't feel that they are being treated poorly by peers. Almost as though it's OK to be fat, if your child has ""nice"" friends. Regardless, I still would have bought this book because it did offer practical & sensitive thoughts on connecting with your overweight child, but do consider additional sources for dietary information."
1,No secrets here,"If you find a secret here you've been living in a cave. Reviews of game types are interesting, but you'll not find illustrations of the machines, or the odds, or the various underlying deal algorithms. The editing is poor (e.g., slots are in isles), and advice like ""play the machines that give the best odds."" Duh!"
2,Not a first class item from Amazon. Sent by other stock purveyor.,Knife blades bend when slicing bread. Doesn't feel safe. Haven't tried it in meat yet. Outside case and sides of unit are scratched -- not a first class item but I'll keep using it for now.
5,Great Value,"This was to replace my last electric knife, which was also a Hamilton Beach. Hope this one last 35 years like the last one did.It looked classy, has its own case and a full tang well made slicing fork that came with it. I would highly recommend this electric knife works great."
3,The blade is thin and too flexible. Motor not as strong.,Finally been using this knife. The blade is very flexible and too thin for my opinion. I was slicing beef roast and the blade keep twisting and not keeping straight. The motor is not as powerful as it should be. It's ok purchase.
5,Great electric carving knife,My wife and I went to the mall to look for a carving knife as ours had broken. There were none in stock. Then I thought of Amazon (should have thought of this earlier.) After examining the choices I liked the shape and features of the Hamilton Beach knife. It has worked better than previous knives as it is a solid design with a well-designed handle and strong blades.I highly recommend this electric carving knife!
2,Good Looks ... Poor Design,"Although this knife looks good and cuts well, the trigger you pull when cutting is quite awkward and I found it difficut to cut any meat without feeling strain on my hand and arm. After carving a large roast I was exhausted! I don't recommend this product to anyone and threw it away."
2,Looks good - anyways,"Best looking knife that doesn't perform to suite me. Purchased as replacement for 15 year old knife worn out knife and saw a good review. Trigger is very awkward. If you have very large hands, you may like the size. It is good looking and has nice case but I do not reccomend for use."
2,Bad Design,"I am a woman, and found this knife bulky to use, my arm was exhausted when cutting a roast. This knife has the knife release on the top, so when you are trying to cut, 1 finger is on the trigger, and your thumb fits right on top of the knife release, you had to think about moving your thumb away from that buttom, so it would not release while you are cutting. I may just throw it away and buy a more user friendly model."
3,The fun of it all.,"Why they decided to name the one flick ""Chain Gang Women"" shows what kind of folks we were dealing with here in the land of ""Drive-in"" movies. A bad flick to be sure, but I was still thinking about this 2 days later! I love it. The story is about a male chain gang that escapes! You only see 2 women in the whole movie if I'm not mistaken. The other prize here ""The Hellcats"" was really bad. This one I just couldn't sit through. Boring bikers hanging out, then hanging out, then looking for something to do!"
1,Don't buy this piece of junk,"On the 2nd day of use, one of the analog display bar stopped showing - now 0 would look like upside down U. I am returning it for refund."
1,poor quality,"This is a really cute clock radio for a little girl, but the numbers in the face don't all show up."
1,What little expectations were held were way too high,When I received this the paper design on the front had already fallen off. The radio can't get any station period just all static. Overall horribly disappointed. I didn't expect a lot to begin with given its a child's toy but I did expect it to last 6mos or so before I had to trash it.
2,Not the best one..,"Ok for me, ive had it 3 years now and the antena doesnt work anymore, which means the radio doesnt work.And the front sticker is falling apart. I'd recommend buying other hello kitty ones, this is very cute but not vey reliable."
1,junk item,"when i receive this item is so disappointed because the item is like used already, the screen of the clock a lot of scratch and the tuning is not working either.. this is a trash"
2,low quality photography,"I agree with Mr. Chiu in one of the previous reviews. I was expecting great photography in this type of book, but instead the book is filled with small, grainy, blury pictures. A much better 'Coffee Table' book is 'Tropical Asian Style', in my opinion."
2,Disappointed,"First my complaints.For what I consider to be a coffee table book, the quality of the photographs (on average 1-2 per page), was incredibly poor. They were simply very blurry and not sharp at all.The book also doesn't quite know whether it wants to be a book on architecture, interior design or Bali society gossip column. I especially hated the constant name dropping on ""so and so"" used to be the life of the Bali party scene and how extravagant the parties were (well, I guess that has gone away definitely since the Bali bombings). I don't mind a short blurbs on the owners, but enough is enough.Now to the good points.The author is a well known and accomplished landscape architect in Bali, so he obviosly knows what he is talking about and what the owner was trying to accomplish in creating these wonderful houses.But I think you can get the same thing from other recent books by the same author, which has much sharper and clearer photos."
5,At Home in the Island of the Gods,"At Home in Bali is a beautiful book that showcases 24 Balinese homes, each of which exhibits the arts, crafts and magic of Balinese design. It takes you from the mountains to the beaches, through the rice fields, villages, palaces and temples of Bali. Gardens, terraces and open spaces receive a separate chapter. This book is a photographic delight and will bring back fond memories for travellers to Bali. If you have never been, this book will create the desire to go."
5,beautifully photographed book,"I would like to comment on a previous review, on this fine book, as a photographer i am happy to see Isabella Giananneschi work as different from the usual ""sharp"" ""crispy"" and predictable images, hers is very expressive and for someone who lives for 6 months in a year in Bali, she was able to capture the mood of the place beautifully. I also believed that she should be credited for bringing her work to a higher level of sophistication.this book is a must buy and 5 stars to the photographer and the author for thier efforts!"
5,"Wonderful title, wonderful book","The concept of the ""ghost light"" is just magnificent. This book gave me much-wanted insight into the development of a theatre critic."
3,This author was given a lot of freedom,I can't believe how much time this author spent unsupervised in NYC. Memoir? seems a bit far fetched to me.
1,More than I ever wanted or needed to know about Frank Rich.,"Frank Rich's greatest contribution to the American Theater was leaving it. Why anyone would want to read this self-serving, self-glorifying thing amazes me. I'm embarrassed to say I read it. I read an advance copy lent to me by a friend who got it for free. Because I'm a speed reader I didn't waste too much of my time. I've been a lifelong theatregoer and I saw many of the plays Frank Rich reviewed. He was a pompous, pretentious critic and even though I can't deny I like some of the think pieces he now does for The New York Times, his memoir is a bore. If Mr. Rich were reviewing this it would close opening night."
3,GM Wiring Harness,Wiring harness works fine. Disapointed the volume button on my steering wheel will not work the radio and it did on the factory radio.
5,Wonder and Mystery,"Ruins left by ancient civilizations frequently excite the wonder and admiration of modern-day readers. The ""lost city"" of Machu Picchu is certainly no exception; but the appeal of this book is unlike its predecessors in that the wonder and mystery of the site are conveyed, not solely by hyperbole or romantic generality, but primarily by hard, objective engineering analysis. Even more wondrous is the authors' achievement in presenting these ""hard facts"" in a language which is equally intelligible and appealing to engineers and to the general reader. In short, this book makes clear to all that the planning and construction of a city are activities which transcend quantitative analysis and mathematical formulas. The copious and well-chosen illustrations contribute much toward inspiring a respect on the part of us sophisticated moderns for the accomplishments of ""primitive"" cultures, unlettered as they may have been."
5,awsome book,"The Inca were incredible engineers, given that they had no beasts of burden and no written language. The book is excellent."
3,"I loved the actual SONGS on ""Eat It""","but felt the album's production was horrible. On most of the songs, Greg Ridley's bass is so prominent in the mix (even on the acoustic tracks) that it upset the balance and makes the other instruments sound muted....Jerry Shirley sounded like he was tapping on a shoe box, especially on side one. Ridley was an excellent musician but the sound of a bass way out front does disservice to a band like the Pie....they should have hired a good producer. Still good but could have been awesome. ""Smokin'"" remains the band's high point, at least to me."
4,Eat It All Up,"I don't understand the harsh criticism of this GREAT album by Humble Pie. Eat It really rocks! This is all Steve Marriott he is credited with writing or contributing the lyrics to all the originals, and there are nine, on the album. The original lp was a double and broken into 4 parts side one rock, side two soul covers, side three acoustic, side four live. And from the Philly soul of Get Down to It to the stomp of I'm a Roadrunner, Eat It delivers. Why American FM radio refuses to play such classic songs as Good Booze and Bad Women, Drug Store Cowboy, and Beckton Dumps is beyond me. Anyone who likes goodtime bluesy rock and roll will love this album. But get the Japaneese mini LP edition its sounds much better and the packaging is absolutely superb."
3,Nice try but no gold medal.,"The double-album ""Eat It"" is Humble Pie's attempt to create their own ""Exile on Main Street."" Unlike the Rolling Stones, whose rock music was largely blues-based, the Pie's origins were more along the lines of Ray Charles-style R&B. Like ""Exile"" the sound is rawer, less polished, and in many places more interesting that the band's commercial releases. The big difference is this: Humble Pie were NOT the Stones (or the ""Physical Grafitti""-era Zeppelin) and they ran out of steam about two and one-half sides into ""Eat It."" The live tracks, which are tedious at best, seem tacked on just to fill out the record. A nice acquisition for fans of the British blues-rock era - it proves there was more to HP than ""I Don't Need No Doctor"" - but I wouldn't break the bank for it."
2,666,This album is only good with the last three songs.If you can find a good used copy for 5 bucks or less.
5,If You're a Fan,You have to watch this if you are a fan of PHC. To see some of the biographical material is a real treat.
4,Brit-pop with a twist,"Octopus turns out anything but run-of-the-mill Brit-pop. Their sound fluctuates wildly from peppy pop tunes to darker, somewhat psychedelic sounds. It keeps you on your toes. If you want an album in which you don't get 12 tracks that sound like ""variations on a theme"" (i.e. one long song divided into 12 tracks!), then this CD may be worth your while. Among the standout tunes (I like the pop sound, personally) are ""Your Smile"" (which has great brass), ""If You Want to Give Me More,"" and ""Jealousy."" And, as an added bonus, you get a CD cover that unfolds into a board game, so what more could you ask?"
4,Short and Sweet,"It is a short and sweet video that does exactly as described... Offers stories from real people who have had their life changes by the labyrinth. I was hoping for, and looking for, a video that had more facts and history of the labyrinth itself, but I can't fault this video for not having that, the description did not say it did. I am glad to have added this to my collection."
3,good family film,"great family film with Elijah Wood as North. Wood has 24 hours to find new parents or he goes back to his orignal ones who are past out and put on display in a museum(just hilarious). he meets a lot of new folks, including, Dan Aykroyd, John Ritter, Faith Ford, Kelly McGillis, Alexander Gounov, Kathy Bates, Graham Greene, Reba MacIntyre and a whole cast load of fun stars including Abe Vigoda, Joe Polito, Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Julia Lous Dreyfuss, Richard Belzer and the great Bruce Willis(who looks cute in a bunny suit) a great time, though theres some violence involving gunfire at north"
2,"""North"" Needs to Head in an Upward Direction...","This movie had WONDERFUL acting; you would be hard pressed to find better acting from EVERY actor in a family movie. The problem lies in the story... While the idea was cute and perfect for a family film, it was just too pathetic for anyone, including kids, to relate to. Even if a kid was to take over the world, grown adults wouldn't think of serving his every whim. This movie should definatly be seen once by every family with young kids, but once is enough, trust me... Parts are very funny, and others very touching but the story is the scum of movie making."
5,"Different, but Good","A good movie, but not a great movie. It wasn't that it was hard to watch, but different and you had to keep up with it."
4,VHS,Great packing. Great movie. We love it so much. Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!
3,One point in the film...,"I love the part when the kids trick North into thinking his parents don't want him back. They record them on video saying how much they really want him back. Afterwards, the kids say to his parents that if they don't get him back, they can adopt another boy named Hugh. The parents say ""We don't want Hugh, he's not our son!"" The kids then edit out the part with North's parents asking him to come back, leaving just the part where they say they don't want Hugh. It sounds like they're saying ""We don't want you!"""
1,Can I give a negative score... PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!,"You know, people talk about bad movies. When seeing Bruce Willis as The Easter Bunny is the highlight of a movie...P>To say this movie is the worst I ever saw doesn't do it justice. I would be tempted to watch Mondo Trasho, a movie which caused me to need therapy, before I would watch this again (ok, that's an exaggeration... I didn;t need therapy, but I felt soiled after watching it).Take a talented director, and tell him to remove all semblance of a real plot, good dialog, and good acting, and North would get an A+++++.... This has to be used as a movie to teach others how not to make a movie.To this day, I can't take Elijah Wood seriously as an actor. It was only after I made that connection that I started to enjoy ""Lord of the Rings"".On second thought, burn every copy of this film and remove it from human memory. This would be the kindest act that could be blessed upon humanity."
3,Disappointed with sound,"Musically speaking this a cohesive and delightful selection of songs played by the master Sergio Mendes and his great line-up. Absolute ear candy!! What takes away from this music is the horrible mastering job. I paid over $30.00 for this cd, and it sounds like it was dubbed from overmodulated tapes....it's hard to listen to ...it sounds like the worn vinyl counterpart sitting in my sisters album case. This is not fair representation for Sergio Mendes who would have a fit if he knew his music was being heard like this. Very poor for a (remastered) ha! ha! Japanese import..shame on BMG!! I intend to get a refund on this one!"
5,Finally found it !!,"I look for Sergio ""Where is the love"" for long time, and finally got it. I love this music. It isn't labelled as the best, for me it is the best (just without Masquenada). Maybe this is also Sergio's best line-up.Suprisingly I also love ""Put A Little Love Away"", ""Killing me softly..."", ""I won't last a day without you"". I don't see any reason for not have this album. Whether you're a fan or not, you'll love it.."
3,good...,"i've read many outlines in this biblical vein. also read, 'what the bible is all about for young explorers' by dr. henrietta mears."
5,Nice looking case,"I have built several computers for home use. I am not in a computer related profession. I purchased this unit locally for $65 plus tax. I did not get a manual with it, but assembly was easy. It came with a rear case fan and I added a front and side fan as well. The fan placement allows the computer to run quietly, which I really like! I have an ASUS mother board installed, one HD and one DVD burner. Everything was very easy to install. If you like not having a bunch of screws and small parts, this case would be for you. Easy access to all components,especially for cleaning, snap off the front panel and the side panels slide forward."
1,would have been nice,"I purchased these twice from 2 different vendors through amazon , twice the the order was canceled and I then found out that amazon holds orders for up to 90 minutes before submitting them to the seller . The best thing I can tell you is simply do not use amazon . If you find a product you want , go to the web page of the seller and purchase them directly from them"
1,KING SOLOMON'S TREASURE,"I love the King Solomon's movies and thought I would try this one knowing it would not be as good as the others. It was a terrible movie and a waste of 3 star actors. Dinasours in Africa and cheaply done. The worst part the dvd starts right off five minutes into the movie, no movie title or credits or start of the movie. When you get to the end of the movie and go through all the credits, the movie starts proper and you see the first 5 min. you missed. It was too expensive for the quality you were getting."
2,Oh Brother... two stars at best!,"This movie was hilarious! Not because it was a comedy, but because of the terrible mishaps of a low-budget film. Several times the background moved because someone jarred the backdrop, oh and those ""dinosaurs!"" And for such well known actors (many are in the 007 movies), I was appauled at the acting, maybe because they were quite young when this movie first came out (1977). Apparently they didn't practice their parts in advance, or the directing was bad. And the ending, well, after all that work to get there, and all they had been through, no one even TRIED to get the treasure? There were so many places that this movie could have been improved. So I only rated this with two stars. Only worth getting if you like to giggle over the older classics, with fake scenery, stiff clay animals, and old style acting. Also, could easily have a Quatermain cult following."
3,CUTE,"HI,This is cute. I comes with 1 teeter-totter& 2 animals,a doggie& kitten.It's pretty durable, but the teeter-totter does come off the base if you pull. YAY!,i'm the 1rst to write a review 4 this toy!(It might not look like now,but when I went to type this it said""be the first person 2 review this item.)The pets stay on 'cause of their magnets.(don't try to balance this with these 2 pets,the dog is way too heavy. The teeter-totter goes well @the whirl around playground,but it won't fit anywhere but the rooms.BYE,DARCY"
4,Clymer Manual,"Hi, First, Dealing with the seller was very easy and there was no hassles. I would deal with them again. The book is very good except there was a misprint and some of the pages were cut crooked! About 10 pages worth. Not the sellers fault. This was done at the print shop."
4,My 3-year-old loves it!,"I was so thrilled when I found out that Timmy was getting his own show - he's so cute! I loved the episodes in Shaun the Sheep that centered around Timmy and now we have this DVD that focuses soley on Timmy and his preschooler friends! And yes, there are several new characters now, Timmy's playmates at school and his teachers.All of the episodes in Timmy Time are geared toward the toddler/preschooler crowd with plots and comedy they can relate to and understand. In one of my favorite episodes, Timmy's friend Apricot brings her blankie to school only to have someone mistake it for a rag to clean up! Timmy keeps bringing her replacements, hoping to help her. The best thing about this show is that each episode encourages sharing and thinking of others even when you are busy doing something else. :) I'm hoping that seeing Timmy being so thoughtful will rub off on my toddler!"
4,Timmy,My son loves Timmy so much. He will watch this time and time again. I am sure this will be used for our next child when he or she grows up. Happy to recommend.
3,for 2-3 year olds,"I have a 4 year old daughter that has watched Sean the Sheep episodes since she was 2. Timmy time would be great for 2 -3 year olds. my 4 year old actually found this to be pretty slow moving and dumb. She did not sit through it and I don't blame her. For adults...it is geared for 2 to 3 year olds, action and storyline follows as age appropriate."
3,its ok.,My little man who is 4 LOVES Shaun the sheep and was excited to see this new movie. He watched it maybe two times and hasn't watched it again. Timmy cant even compare to Shaun the Sheep!!
3,Game is OK,"I thoght that this game was going to be great.One of the options i was really excited about was skirmish mode, but it turns out that you can only be a predator and marine instead of an alien. But I love the multiplayer mode. that is why this gets a three."
4,not so clear...,"let me geuss you have seen the aliens, and predator movies but whonder if this game would peek your intrest will you may be disipointed some campains with a certion spices (predator) may be the only species and campaions youd be intresed in altought i'm a alien type of guy the cheap form of combat seem to make me happy. but this game my not intrest thought who like seeing enemy's hole and not in peices when shot. altought the outher spises whould be most intresting when in combat. but there is no such thing as being bored...enjoy the graphic nature of extreme action..."
4,"Humble Pie, almost forgotten legends.","Humble Pie really lets it out on this one. Peter Frampton is in rare form, far part II of this LP, and hear a more mature Peter, just listen to ""Frampton Comes Alive"", the greatest live LP ever produced."
4,This album is a lot of fun.,"Some of the melodies are little awkward, but there are several great tracks that make it worthwhile. A lot of energy and angst make this a good listen."
5,Good little java book for someone who is new to Java,Good little Java book for people who are new to Java although an understanding of Object Oriented programming is needed. The material is presented in a very concise manner. Nice compact size too. It's a relief from all those other huge programming books.
4,Excellent Desktop Java Reference,"*for experienced programmers, NOT for beginners* This book by far beats out any other as a handy Java reference. For those times when you need more explanation than what Sun provides with the API but you don't want to wade through beginner basics, _Java in Plain English_ is perfect."
1,product review,"I was very disappointed in this product. While it dried the lettuce, it was awkward and difficult to handle. There is no handle to hold onto, so it is difficult to spin without sending it flying across the room. The bowl has drain holes in it so the water gets all over your countertop unless you lay it on a towel or spin it in the sink. About 10 years ago, I purchased a salad spinner for $5, and it is the best. I tried to find something similar and was sadly disappointed in the performance of this product."
4,Ultimate? Maybe...,"Well, there's nothing supposedly spectacular you can say about a bag strap, save for the fact that I have just carried my full design kit (MacBook Pro, Graphic tablet, Sketchbooks, accessories etc.) across Europe and the US for the past two weeks and for once i don't have a large red mark across my shoulder. The construction of the strap is satisfyingly robust, everything stays in place like it should, but the real beauty of this strap is the padding. I guess that now i know why cyclists invest in those gel padded seats for a long journey..."
5,Great book for after school programs,"I am using this book with 6-8th grade second language learners who need to work on fluency, comprehension, and oral expression. The short stories are engaging and my students (all Latinas) can easily identify with the different themes presented. The connections my students make with the different story lines make for lively discussions and help them to better understand how they are not alone."
3,Not as expected- but I don't regret buying it.,"I had great hopes for this book, I have read about 8 of the others but this is the least fulfilling one of them all, though I am a Latina. I would give a handful of stories a 5 but the rest aren't up to par. I think that the editors didn't do a thorough search or make use of all some of the channels available (to get the word out.) I know from reading past Chicken Soup books that compilations for these are made by soliciting them in these yet to reach a broader Latino audience more was probably needed and the Hispanic contributor should have known that. Shucks! I hope they come out with a part 2 that is in true Chicken Soup spirit.As for this book being one of few books that celebrate our Latino Spirit- if you are Hispanic I do recommend it."
2,A real disappointment!,"I LOVE Chicken Soup for the Soul books. Some of my all-time favorites are the two African-American (I'm a WASP) and Jewish (I'm Christian). But this one was a major disappointment. The many Spanish words and quotations would have been fine if defined somewhere in the book, but they weren't, and proved very distracting to me. Also, although there were a few warm, touching stories, the vast majority seemed boring and mediocre, with none of the warmth I look for in these books. This was a HUGE disappointment."
3,Gunga Din,"Gunga Din and The Gunga Din are two different bands. Gunga Din did it first in Baltimore in the early 90's. Their first EP, Grip, was followed by their second self-titled album, Gunga Din, which launched their east coast tour in which they opened for Ice-T.The band broke up, spawning Skypup, Moviegoer, and most notably, Nailbiter, lead singer Mike Raymond's latest venture. He had gone on to write, perform, and produce two independant CDs, Skid Plus Seven, and Cradle to Grave. His next band, Nailbiter, made an incredible CD called Six Degrees, then broke up.If you want to hear music from the early 90's that predates the current heavy, grinding, raw sound currently popular, Gunga Din's second album is the way to go. Raymond has always predated music trends, and now continues to push the barriers in another solo CD due out this summer...."
4,Fantastic book!,I liked this book bc the mystery was really difficult and Cam solved it with her amazing memory! I recommend this book to other kids.
2,Is this actually 2000?,"I'm new to administration and I've noticed several things that are wrong. This book seems like just version 7 with a new cover. All they talk about is SQL Server 7. It will say things like ""In SQL Server 7, however, these stored procedures have been removed..."". That's all well and good but I bought a book on SQL Server 2000 and in 2000, they are there and I've been using them. I just wonder if they were trying to use them wrong and so they couldn't find them. I'm not sure how many of the mistakes are just changes between the versions and how many are wrong in both books. I recommend looking somewhere else."
4,Tried it and loved it,"I had a small bottle of this that I took with me on vacation. I was surprised how much I actually liked it. I do not like the oily feel of baby oil (if you use that in the shower) and this did not feel that way to me. As a matter of fact, after my return home, I used up the remainder of the bottle. I have been looking in stores ever since and have had difficulty finding it on the shelves. Thus, I am online to search for it here. Give it a try, it may surprise you as well."
4,a nice book,The book gives us a clear summary of different equations and detailed examples.worthy to be recommended
4,hathaway52,"Good, overview for someone (like me) who has never done any reloading.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, is that I had nothing to compare it with and no prior knowledge of the subject."
1,Terrible and disappointing,This is just another worthless film from somebody who never experienced combat or made tough decisions from a leadership position. The director comes across as completely biased with an obvious lack of objectivity. Monday morning quarterbacking at its best.
2,NOT COMBAT FOOTAGE!,"One of the reviewers said that if you like combat footage then this is the documentary for you. THAT IS COMPLETELY FALSE! I do not know what he was smoking at the time. This documentary is 95% footage of political dialog and 5% maybe of actual field footage.I m not saying this isn't a film worth watching as that would depend on your interest. It has a great historical background of how everything came about over there and where it went, and who was involved. But if your looking for a lot of combat footage this isn't the film for you."
1,Boring mostly,"This book is not good for information on diet and health, however it does have a table listing amounts of common foods with amounts equalling 100 calories."
5,Great additon to my pregnancy collection,"Great for any expectant mother and her labor coach (whether husband, relative, doula, or other close friend) . Not an ""exercise"" DVD in the sense of physical workouts, but instead is poses and practice techniques to use in labor and birth, especially if you have a goal for a natural birth. My hubby and I will be using this weekly during my final trimester as we gear up for the birth of our second son. I like Rocki's straight forward manner, clear demonstrations, and her explanation of the purpose for each one."
1,Not worth your time,"This DVD is much worse than her Labor Prep Volume 1. There was only one position in this that was good. She can't seem to focus while she talks and says things like "" the bulging thing"" instead of the ""baby crowning"". Besides being an obviously low budget dvd she has no good information and uses extrememely innappropriate and unintelligent word choices. She has no idea what she is talking about. Also the fact that she also said, ""when the doctor tells you to push"". A doctor should not tell you to push a woman will know when it is time. Besides I assume that the women using this plans to have a natural unmedicated birth and possibly even one at home. The only time the doctor tells you to push is if you are medicated and don't feel your own body. Don't waste your money!"
2,Good information but...,"This video has some good labor information, and the instructor seems to know what she is talking about. However, the scenery and filming are so unflattering and unattractive, this video did not keep my interest. If you want real prenatal yoga get Gurmukh's or Anna Getty's DVDs- much more yoga-like and much more aesthetically pleasing."
4,"Tasty for adults, not so much for kids","I originally bought this as snacks for my son's class (he's in 2nd grade). The kids didn't like them at all- my son included. I, however, did enjoy them as they have a very light flavor (mostly coconut, I couldn't taste much of the strawberry) and are not very sugary at all. Perhaps this is why I liked them but the children did not. Overall, I recommend this product as a healthy snack but gave it 4 stars because unless your children don't like sweet things, they will probably not like these coconut bars."
5,Southern Sisters Series,"I have read Anne George's Southern Sisters Series several times and it is still my all time favorite series. All of her books are so funny and ""down-homey,"" you want to savor them, not just read them. Anne George writes so well, that you feel like you are right in the room with the characters and the action.I have given this series as a gift before and I am giving it again, because Anne George and the eight books in the Southern Sisters Series will make you want to cry sometimes and sometimes they will make you want to laugh out loud. I think anyone would enjoy these books."
5,Fantastic Book,"This is an ESSENTIAL book for every Jewish household. It contains essays of interest about all sorts of Jewish topics, ranging from religion to history. Truly intelligent and insightful, it is a MUST HAVE."
5,Jimmy Nail CD,"Product is in perfect condition. Didn't like the material much, too country. Delivery was ok, nowhere near as fast as the other product I ordered on the same day, but arrived eventually."
2,Flat cushion,I purchased this chair and everything seemed great until one week later. The seat cushion went flat. They must use some low grade foam within the seat because now it is flat and hard.
3,Slightly boring for kids but okay for parents,"My kids were NOT interested in this book, but I pick it up all the time and try to use it."
3,an afternoon well spent,"I wanted a romance but one well written, so what better guide than the writer of the Thorn Birds, a book that rends me even in the remembering, twenty years later? The Ladies of Missalonghi, with the occasional illustration (who does this anymore?!) is an afternoon's delight, like the fairy cakes its characters concoct and consume with relish. I admit towards the second half, it felt more low brow than high fiction, but the eponymous protagonist is just dowdy enough to lull, bright enough to change, and downtrodden enough to gratify when she stands up and grows into her own. Add a dash of mystery, and the prospect of romance, all set in a lushly described small town valley in Australia. An afternoon well spent, IMHO."
1,"I liked the story better when I read it in ""The Blue Castle""","Sure, McCullough wrote the brilliant ""The Thorn Birds"", but she clearly lacked the common sense to know that if you MUST plagiarize, do not plagiarize the work of a country's most famous and beloved author, and don't do it so badly!This book is, at best, mediocre. At worst, a complete waste of paper, ink and time. Read ""The Blue Castle"" instead."
1,Is it even legal?,"This is a total rewrite of ""Blue Castle"" but so much worse, with the hero who is a rude bastard almost 50, etc. Many RF books repeat a formula or spin off the same fairy tale (Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, etc.), but THIS is a real rewrite of a very original and charming story by L.M. Montgomery! Where was the editor?????"
1,Yuck..,"Judging from the reviews it seems all that have read The Blue Castle by L.M. Montgomery weren't happy with this book at all. The same is true for me. The Blue Castle is full of beauty and humor...while this novel was a pale shadow of it. The story line is very much the same, but holds none of L.M. Montgomery's magic. Frankly, the book was boring and I skipped through most of it once I got to the middle. In my opinion, skip this novel and read The Blue Castle."
5,Fascinating and fun,Unusual enough to keep the pages turning long after I should have been sleeping with just enough magic and cheering to keep it in my mind for days afterwards. I read it again two days later just to catch anything I might have missed the first time through.
3,"OK for this genre, I guess","For some reason I thought this was going to be a somewhat meatier 'Shell Seeker' type-book, and I continued to think so until about the middle of the book, but then realized it was a romance novel.OK, I guess as romance novels go. I thought the 'ghost' storyline was stupid - at one point, I thought maybe she had faked her death. No matter, pretty well-written for it's genre but nothing I'd highly recommend."
1,"Loved until I read ""The Blue Castle""","I loved this book when I first read it. I found it funny and refreshing. In fact, I replaced my paperback copy with a hardcover copy. Then I read ""The Blue Castle"" by L.M. Montgomery, the auther of ""Anne of Green Gables"". That's when I discovered that ""The Ladies of Missalonghi"" is nothing but a rewrite of another book! It is more than just similar plotlines which often occurs in the Romance genre. It really is a knock-off of Montgomery's book which was first copyrighted in 1926. I was so disappointed that I now rate this book a 1 (the worst)"
3,At A Loss,"I am at a loss as to what to say about this charming book. It was a lovely and engaging read. I gave copies to my mother and my sister, and thought happy thoughts about it. Well, I just read The Blue Castle by LM Montgomery and guess what? The Ladies of Missalonghi is A TOTAL RIP! What was this respected and talented author THINKING? I really don't understand what happened or why, but TLoM is...it's....it's.....an unalloyed rip-off The Blue Castle in EVERY way. I am going to assume the best and decide that it was intended as an homage. Any other conclusion is unthinkable. The book is great. But I recommend the original and not this re-write, after all credit should rest with the real author: the immortal LM Montgomery."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I read this book after reading the Thorn Birds, hoping that another book by the same author would be as enjoyable. I was thoroughly disappointed though. It had none of the magic that the Thorn Birds had, it was just another romantic story with a sappy happy ending. It wasn't even extremely enjoyable, it didn't grab you or fascinate you or pull you along with it. I couldn't believe the author of such a great book as The Thorn Birds could write such an uninteresting story. I only kept reading it because I hoped it would get better. It didn't. To make matters worse, it wasn't even realistic. It included a ""ghost"", which is an easy way to avoid reality and patch things up perfectly in a book. I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed The Thorn Birds."
4,The book for understanding American Buddhism in 1999,"The book is offers an overview of the major type of Buddhism available in the US. It charts the conflicts, changes and continuity of American Buddhism looking at a major world religion meeting the late 20th century's dominate power.IMHO the best essays are ""Who is a Buddhist"" where the author explains ""Elite, Ethnic and Evangelical"" Buddhism. Rita Gross ""Helping the Iron Lady Fly"" she lays out her opinion on the state of current sexual morality and its intersection with the Mentor-Disciple relationship.I had hoped to read an essay from someone related to the Interracial Buddhist Council, with regard to Elite Buddhism relationship to ethnic minorities."
5,A rare hybrid style of soul/funk /rock- a must have.,"When I first heard this album in the 70's, I couldn't beleive it. It was like Stevie Wonder, Chicago, Trapeze and Tower of Power. How did a label come to beleive in the project? Simply put, ""talent"" and an over the top vocal ability. Glenn shows his love for music, and style on this one.Trapeze( Mel Galley and Dave Holland) session on this one, and the extra cuts for the CD release make this one valuable."
4,"it's not deep purple, thank god","this album was released at the time of the fusion jazz crossover. it's way more funky than deep purple. i am a purple fan, second generation, but the other solo projects by ex-purple mates are just imitations of the real thing. this album is all about the late 70's rock- funk. you have to develop a taste if it's your first glenn hughes album. his voice has great range and the band is very rhythmic. it's all about the groove."
2,Very disappointed!!!!,This abridged version was just not right the first 3 sides deal with only the beginning and the last side with only the finale. no middle or anything in between. I own other novelas on dvd and i hadnt been ripped off yet until i got this. if you are contemplating on buying this product i suggest you save your money for something better.
1,Dissappointed because it is incomplete,I was really getting into it and then there was a large segment missing. I thought I had a lemon copy but after reading the other reviews I see that all were the same. The gulpe bajo was to those that spent money on this and didn't receive the full novela...Pist off...don't waste your money..
1,Very disappointed,"I fully agree with the other reviewers. I just do not feel that I can even give it 2 stars. And this has nothing to do with the performance of the actors. They were superb.The telenovela only shows the beginning of the movie and then the end. A whole chunk in the middle is missing. And there is not even a lead in part before the end which tells you what went on.Charge a bit more for the DVD, but do not shortchange the customer. Bah!"
2,too bad they have cut too much of the film denaturating it,"The film is good in itself the actors are good but the film has been once again too much cut denaturating it...suddenly, the woman who laid for two years in the coma is dead and we hear that the husband who waited so long for her to wake up, has divorced her (so she must has woken up, been a vilain etc and been killed, the husband who was such a weak man is suddenly transformed in a killer who killed everybody...why? how? when?...whatever...it is really not worth your time and money... Do not buy it if you want to spend a good time...once again it is the same company who cut the film as the one which made El Candidato y un nuevo amor...with very little regard for the novela and very little regard for the consumers...maybe just interested in quick money..."
5,GMAX physical tutorial and walkthrough.,"This book was useful in many ways, I appreciate having a physical piece of information to teach myself with instead of clicking screen after screen trying to find online tutorials in english and aren't fake virus websites. This book gives details and is loaded with pictures to help you on your way at becoming an above-skilled builder with GMAX.The downside, is that it's a real book, and real books scare me. It covers A LOT, so you better be willing to sit tight and go through this book if you're serious about learning GMAX. I suggest also buying highlighters and a notebook, though there is plenty of room to write in the book itself."
3,"Top shelf cast produces a very dull, dry, movie","This happens when trying to portray a very famous, creative, historical figures. And I think the cast is wonderful and tried their best but maybe what happens is the actors have so much reverence for the character, they seem to loose sight of the fact that they were also human, had bad habits, drank/smoke too much, swear, are moody, smell, burp all the disgusting things people do/and are, but put together in the right order can come up smelling like a rose. If you follow my train of thought. I liked the movie with Audrey Tatou as Coco better, maybe because she's French and understands the character better, not take away from the actors in this film who I thought did a good job but just didn't quite pull it off."
4,Gift Wife Rated Movie 4 stars,The Movie had a very Good Cast. Very detailed about Coco Chanel's Life. Learned alotabout Coco Chanel's Life that she didn't know before viewing the movie.
5,Way Better Than Coco Before Chanel By All Means,I have seen both this movie and Coco Before Chanel and this movie is definitely the stand out of the two. This movie has much more emotion in the character of Coco and a true love story as the main plot. Intriguing and interesting Coco's raise to riches as a top fashion designer with the trials and tribulations of the loves of her life. A true treasure overlooked by the overwhelming presence of the newer version.
3,More about the Brand than the Woman,This movie is long (over 2 hours). The very beginning is about her life and how the brand came about. I read about her in wikipedia and realized there is a lot about this woman's life that isn't in this movie. I thought that the move was slow placed and could have been condensed. They showed a lot of the same scenes 3-4 times. Wasting the viewers time while adding filler to make it longer.
4,Could have been better,"I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID I DONT ENJOY WATCHING THIS MOVIE, BUT THE ACTING OF YOUNG CHANEL IS PRETTY POOR. MCLANE DOES A GREAT JOB BUT IT DOESNT COVER FOR THE REST OF THEM. I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AND AM WILLING TO PUT ASIDE MY ISSUES WITH THE ACTORS BECUASE I LOVE WATCHING HOW COCO BUILT AN EMPIRE."
5,"Great pix, good service","Great bio, Mc Claine is tart and moving as the aging Coco. Fascinating early life of an independent smart woman. Of course Chanel went on re-inventing her past but still always a rags-to-riches epic."
4,Overall very good!,Enjoyed movie although some of the scenes were not based on true facts of Coco Chanel's life. Overall movie was good.
2,Disappointing.,"I got this to use with my Nokia 8801 and laptop computers.Using with phone: while the sound quality itself was surprisingly good, with better than expected yet not boomy bass and clear treble, the sound would stutter or drop out, even with my phone very close to the headset. I tried several songs and all did this. I suppose it could be the phone, but some web research suggests this is a common problem when using wireless bluetooth headsets. It may be a bandwidth issue with Bluetooth v1.2.With my IBM X40, using the included USB audio gateway: many fewer dropouts, but still some--even though I was sitting at the computer.Bottom line: probably not ready for prime time. I also found them to be uncomfortable - a bit too pressing on the ears - after about 5 minutes. I wear mens' hat size M, and the headbands are not adjustable."
1,Fan motor failed in first two weeks,"This is a terrible product. Don't buy it. The fan motor on ours failed after less than two weeks of use. We purchased the fan for one limited purpose - to circulate fresh air into the bathroom during our showers. Even with this small amount of use, the fan motor didn't even last two weeks."
2,NOT LEATHER BOUND,this book is not leather bound as advertised. It is a great guide but sellers need to not misrepresent merchandise.
3,OK for the Basics,"I think that all of North Americas sea shore critters can not be described in a single book. Certainly not in a book of this size. The publishers where quite bold in the scope and as such much information has been left out. That said let me tell you what is good about this book. The pictures are GREAT! Much better than looking at technical drawings. However, they are not better for identification. The descriptions of animal groups are excellent. For the person with little biological background this will go a good way toward explaining the complexities of ocean life. The method of identification, sorting by superficial appearance is handy, again for the inexperienced. To sum it up, if you want one book to carry during your first summer of beach combing get this one. If you need a companion for a marine zoology class stay away, unless you already have everything else."
2,Somewhat slow reading,"I agree with the review by ""Historian"" but want to add a little. After reading ""Hubble Wars"", this looked like another fascinating book about the politics of NASA. I am disappointed with the author's style. While ""Hubble Wars"" was hard to put down and one of my favorite books, this plods along in a fact-filled but boring slog to the end."
5,theaterdud strikes back from review on GD's Inter. Superhits!,"Soooooooooo, cool!This cd has the normal version of the cd plus a bonus cd with live tracks on it.My most favorite songs on this cd was the hell song, over my head, still waiting, and all messed up.A must buy for Sum 41's fans!"
1,Horrible Experience,"I purchased this CD for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. While listeneing to the CD, we found that the second disk did not work. When put into the CD player, we recieved a message of ""Bad Disk"". Since we had opened the CD, we weren't able to return it because Amazon's return policies state that they only accept videos / CDs in an ""unopened"" condition. How, as a consumer, are we to know if what we purchase isn't defective until we open the package. As a 1st time buyer through Amazon, I am extremely discouraged. If this is the kind of customer service that Amazon will continue to offer it's patrons, I for one refuse to purchase another item from them."
4,Good but not Kundera at his height,"'The Joke' is, no doubt, a fine book. Yet compared to Kundera's other works, it fails to impress me. The plot lacks the subtle and surprising turns which 'The Book of Laughter and Forgetting', 'Immortality' or even 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' contained. If you are really after the ""real"" Kundera, read 'The Book of Laughter and Forgetting"" - you will discover the best book you will ever have read."
4,A great book of love and socialism.,"The story is developed strangely at the begining of the book; nevertheless we can infer most of the character's ""leitmotive"" when you have already read the third chapter. Every action of the main character (Ludvik) is the direct consequence of his called ""Stupid Joke"". Love is not easy in the story, sometimes is aggressive, others tender.I think there was a little missunderstanding of Liev Trotsky's role in the ""Social Revolution"" in Czech Republic. Because he was the victim of Stalin afted Lenin's deth."
4,The premiere novel of a world famous novelist.,"_The Joke_ is the first, and most traditional, novel byMilan Kundera, the well-known author of _The UnbearableLightness of Being_. The story of a man who is sent toprison after he sends his girlfriend what he thinks arehumorous remarks about Soviet philosophy on a postcard,this book shows the influence of Kafka as Kunderaruthlessly brings the absurdity of life in a totalitarianstate to an end that comes not with a bang but with awhimper. This new edition corrects serious errors made inthe first translation, and which Kundera describes in hisintroduction."
4,Thought - provoking,A beautiful book about the eternal human search for meaning in a short-lived society that claimed to have all the answers.
5,"Beautiful, original and moving.","This was my first experience of a Kundera novel, and I now find myself in awe of this brilliant writer. This cleverly constructed book unfolds gently and gradually to reveal the complexities of the characters involved, all of whom appear to be victims of circumstance. It explores the natural human desire for freedom, happiness, love and mutual understanding. Although the environment may in part stunt these potentials, it is mostly a person's own inner turmoils and imagination that destroys their ability to find happiness. At times I shed tears at the tragedy of the human condition, but also at the sheer eloquence and profundity of Kundera's thoughts. The main characters, whether male or female, are narrated in the first person, which reveals the author's great capacity for empathy, and writing skill in making these transitions believable. Surprisingly, there is often a delightful, underlying humour within the tragedy, perhaps a little like life itself."
4,Great for yoga class,"It's actually a 4.5 stars. I am a yoga instructor. This is the first CD I bought for my class, and it works beautifully! As picky as I'm toward the music I use for my class, I like music that's relaxing yet not boring to put you to sleep. I do have to mention though, the last song ""Ritual Waves"", I found is very disturbing..."
4,An alternative to long form improvisation,"This is an interesting approach, I think--keep the pieces short and sweet, using mostly guitars with different methods of producing sounds from them. At times humorous, fun to listen to, and worth having in any collection. It makes you want to pick up your own guitar and do this, but you know the results wouldn't be as good."
5,Wow!!,"Great early 70's hard rock with nice, light acoustic songs mixed in thanks to Peter Frampton. Sort of like the Stones meet the Faces. 'Live with Me' is a fantastic ""slow burner"".Tracks 1.5, 7, and 8 rock and are classic Humble Pie from 1970"
2,not worth the big bucks,"This certainly isn't worth the 75 bucks. I ordered the cd a while back when it was temporarily back in print, and it isn't that great. You only get a handful of songs (vinyl's worth). Peter Frampton can really drag down a song with mushy, dramatic lyrics, especially on the Earth and Water Song. Steve Marriot tries to be too backwoods. I liked Big Black Dog though. If anyone should have one Humble Pie album, it would be Rockin The Fillmore '71. If you have to have one more, get either Smokin' or Rock On. And it won't cost you both arms and legs like this does!"
5,"Necessary Evils- ""Spider Fingers""","Yeah, this is some pretty scuzzy stuff. Not the kind of mind bendingly evil music I had expected from the numerous rants I'd heard about them, but it is some freaking rowdy garage rock anyway. The music is flat out tough and pretty damned punk the entire way through. I for one don't think these guys are killers or anything like that, but they quench my musical thirst for something that sounds horrible quite nicely, like the Sonics on some kind of devastatingly bad trip or the Murder City Devils without all that bothersome metal influence. The ridiculously hoarse yelling, simple garage punk instrumentation, occasionally replete with the perennially cool and sorta sinister sounding Farfisa organ, and kinda spooky songs are all just great, so if you are interested in anything along those lines, this is top notch stuff."
3,Okay Set,"Being a fan, I was somewhat disappointed by the track listings on this disc. Yes, it's only Tom Robinson Band stuff from his first two EMI/Harvest albums. Nope, it doesn't shed any new light on Tom. Other labels have produced slightly better collections (look for Connoisseur's Back In The Old Country anthology), but NO ONE has yet produced a complete over-view of Tom's incredible songs. Fans should stay away. Those who are curious and don't want to hand over money for two A+/totally recommended titles can dig in..."
3,Ahmad Sakr work,This author desperately needs a better editor. There are so many typos and errors that it is difficult to focus on what is being conveyed. Typical of all Sakr books i have.
5,Pleasant nostalgia,"I bought this book for a trip down memory lane. I also enjoy reading extremely light fiction when I get stressed. As expected I did enjoy reading this and it did remind me of enjoyable reading experiences from my youth. So it helped reduce my stress, gave me a few hours of enjoyment, with a pleasant nostalgic side trip as a bonus."
5,Satisified Customer,Item shiped in a timely manner and arrived in the described condition. Would use this seller again.
1,The taping knife might have been okay...,"If I'd been able to get the sticker off. I think they must have bound it to the knife at the molecular level. Seriously. I tried oil, goo-gone, water, etc... and when I finally managed to scrape the last vestiges off, the entire surface was scratched beyond all comparison - at which point it promptly rusted directly after it's first contact with water."
3,Not a Vegetarian Cookbook,"I just got this cookbook. I am a vegetarian and thought that this would be a good book to use. I haven't tried any of the recipes, but in purusing it , it is very evident that it is not a book writen for vegetarians."
3,OK Book for the price,Just an OK book for the price. A good first book if you knew nothing about grains but not enough information for someone with a little more knowledge.
4,Good stuff,"What a great book. Lots of useful information on being more self-sufficient, even stuff on harvesting your own wild rice!Really liked the layout as well."
5,Every Dog Has The Right to a Knowlegeable Owner,"This book will help. It should be required reading for all dog novices, especially older children. It's well written, the action flows along as the reader accompanies Flynn, who was born under an unlucky star, on his adventures. Through human ignorance and heartlessness, the canine protagonist is forced to embark on an odyssey that ultimately leads to a happy ending. - Flynn, of course, is a symbol for many dogs, misunderstood, rejected, and thoughtlessly thrown to an uncertain fate. In the end, he was taken in by a kind and knowledgeable human. Most discarded dogs aren't so lucky."
3,Cheaper to do it yourself . .,". . . but I am not as artist. Therefore, I would pay the extra money to have a henna tattoo done. Also, the product comes with a lot of warnings which, I have to admit, scared me. The stain does not seem to last as long as when it is professionally done. I would not buy this product again."
4,Process,"Tony Parson's book, ""Man and Boy"" is charming in it's simplicity, profound, and funny at the same time. Narrated by a young father in the throes of change, it is utlimately a story of what matters in life: family, learning to ""let go"" of a loved one, and developing one's own value system and knowing what is right. Writing about how one action affects another, how one thought can change one's perspective, the story is about the process of maturing, of knowing oneself. The book is touching and funny; and it's very true to life. Highly recommended."
1,What is all the fuss about?,"What a huge disappointment. This story line has been written 100 times over. It offered absolutely nothing new and wasn't even written very well. The only reason I finished reading the whole book was because I thought surely, it will turn around and come up with something original. But no...a hugely predictable ending. Don't waste your time reading this one."
2,PREACH IT BROTHER TONY......PREACH IT,"I didnt laugh and I didnt cry.....but yawned a bit....made a bemused face....and scratched my nether regions.I wish this book stopped going on about ""Star wars"" - really got on my pip. Are kids really that obsessed!A good read - and Parsons moves us along very quickly and easy. Superb book for a holiday......but that is all....and on holidays any old stuff can seem like a good read.But I wasnt so keen on all the preaching about Dads looking after kids etc... it got very American in parts. Everyone was used in some way to pour out some line of argument on love, sex, romance, death blaa blaa blaa.It is certainly worth reading, but too much corny detail about death and dying."
4,"Slow at the at first, but then it picks up","I went into reading this book not knowing what it was about. I saw it in the bookstore and liked the title. I have to say, it was slow at first but it picked up. I really enjoyed it. Being a Newlywed, it made me think about when we do have kids and the fight of who get's them. This book really made me think. We really don't ""own"" our kids. If you feel like opening your mind about divorse, children, and growing up, I would say this is a good summer read!"
1,Disappointing & Depressing,"I bought this at an airport after reading the reviews on the back cover and was looking forward to a touching story about a man and his cradle-to-adult relationship with his son.Instead, it is about a self-centered guy who cannot even say ""I'm sorry"" to his wife after cheating on her and then he doesn't understand why she doesn't want anything to do with her. Now he is forced to raise the child, but the book is not about his relationship with the boy, but about the man's wandering through life, and the boy happens to be there.I read this book on one leg of a flight and left it in the seat pocket. It is not something worth keeping; now I wander why I left it to depress someone else."
2,It gave me the blahs.,"It's sentimental twaddle, competently written (for a hack journalist) but with no imagination and no great craft. Not only isn't it the 'thinking man's Kramer v Kramer', it's a direct steal from that film (check out the improbable kid falling off his bike scene, not to mention the entire set-up). It tries to appropriate some of the Nick Hornby bloke-in-his-thirties feeling but comes up short because Parsons has neither the wit nor the imagination of a Hornby. The characters are sketchy - either stereotypes (the bluff old father with the heart of gold)or just not thought through (the protagonist's wife). Two stars because undemanding souls who need an airport read may find it relatively unoffensive."
3,Just OK.,"This was a book I finished but can't recommend it. Who can have much sympathy for a selfish guy who had an affair? It didn't strike me as sentimental and it's not a great work of prose. You want to find out what happens, and the part about the main character and his father is nice, but otherwise it's about a guy who has been given great things in life and he blows it, then feels bad about it."
5,excellent book,"beautiful, beautiful book. provided an exceptional amount of insight into relationships, life, etc. etc. if you are a 20+ year old male you will enjoy this book."
3,Not bad at all,Enjoyed itFirst book that i actually purchased for my KindleGood choice i thinkWould recommend it to others
3,A big disappointment of the book,"I have read the author's ""Man and babe"" and liked it a lot! This book was brought because of a better rating from the reader. Maybe the translator did a much better job to turn the other book into a very interesting book. Lesser than 50 pages into the book, I had already lost the interest to read the most ordinary cheating on the wife and everything went downhill story. To be honest with you, more than 10 days has passed and I had no intention to pick up this book and rather read other books. If you can read Chinese, I would rather recommend you to get the Chinese version ""Man and Babe"". The story is lousy but the way he present it is fun."
4,Living inside a man's head,"Parsons makes me live inside a man's head, a privilege that I've never experienced before.This book makes me understand the stupidity that a man usually do, the struggle and pain that a man do and conceal everyday.You will also see, through this book, kinds of father (or man) that walk on this earth.It's simple, painful, and soothing at the same time. Enjoy!"
4,Like Nick Hornby but a touch more poignant,"Parsons' book was far more emotional than I expected, far more complex, too. Dealing with marriage, fatherhood, life and death, it runs the gamut of emotions. There are some funny moments, but it is not quite the same hip glibness you'll find in Nick Hornby's ""About a Boy.""Really a very touching story of one man's coming to terms with encroaching middle age, single parenthood, and the concept of lasting love. I found Harry's reflections about his relationship with his dad especially poignant. A nice all-around read, very thoughtfully and realistically rendered."
5,One Of My New Favorite Books,"Certain book resonate stronger with you depending on where you are in your life. ""Man and Boy"" was one of those for me. A bestseller in England, and vaguely reminiscent in tone of Nick Hornby, Parsons book is both very funny and deeply moving at the same time. Thirty year old Harry Silver has a great job, a beautiful wife, and a perfect son. But after a one night stand with a co-worker, he suddenly finds himself navigating the waters of single parent life.It's weird to describe a book as feeling like a movie waiting to happen,but this does. It was funny, hopeful,moving,and romantic the way ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", and ""Notting Hill"" were. If you're a fan of those movies or Nick Hornby's books, you'd probably like this."
3,Family values,"A man has everything in life he might wish for: an excellent job, a beautiful wife, and a nice boy. So it seems, until an act of infidelity brings his world into crumbles. Unemployed, left alone with his four-year boy, this man has to face a new reality and new responsibilities. Greatly a reflection of his life experience, Tony Parsons deals with a a very simple issue many contemporary couples have to face. Many people take for granted what love and parenthood is all about, the joys are evident and easily savored, but most often the inherent hardships and sacrificies are ignored. When confronted with the real facts, the main character (Harry Silver) has to reshape not only his daily routine but his family values and life perspectives as well. This confrontation will eventually strenghten his self-respect, character, and family relationships. An easy narrative, with sentimental touches, and a fine reading to relax."
4,enlightening,"relates to the modern world where men are prone to straying, temptations surrounding us, but there will be some who are still hoping to find true love, hoping to learn the real meaning of love, not only falling in love with love,but to learn the real sacrifices one has to make to love with someone. It does in a way touches the hearts of people by putting in a lot of humanity in it. It is basically about a man trying to find himself and to discover what love really is all about. truly worth reading."
4,Great book but somewhat lacking,"Like many who read this book, I was touched with the father's relationship with his son. The author went into great detail of his steps from having little involvement in his son's life to the realization of his importance. I also like the parallel story regarding the father's relationship with his own father. The journey of finding out what it is about your father that makes him that hero in your life is something that many of us go through.What I found lacking was the relationship between the father and the mother. I really didn't see any type of closure with that relationship. I found myself constantly thinking the next page we'd find her showing back up at home, wanting to give it another try. I thought this area needed a little more attention."
1,Trite with an overload of self-righteousness,"... The main character cheats on his wife, and then, not only proceeds to redeem himself by making it out to be HER fault, but he also trys to paint her as an unfit mother. As a single dad, he portrays himself as a saint, so much better at parenting than anyone else on the face of the earth, single or married, has ever been. Must be nice to be a single parent and have to work only when you feel like it..."
2,Hornby-lite,"My wife bought me this book because she knows I like Nick Hornby and it is marketed as a new Hornbyesque voice. But the truth is that it does not have the sparkle, wit, edge or flair of Hornby. The writing is often clumsy, and it reads like a kind of soap opera for sensitive new age guys. I confess that something kept me turning the pages, and that I was genuinely moved by a few scenes, but in the end I just felt manipulated and cheap. I would only recommend it to men with kids who have recently divorced and have no inflated literary standards."
2,disappointed...,"Though the characters were quirky and amusing,I found the story itself utterly inane and the plotline not too believable. The first outing of Doan and Binky was not what I hoped. I'm going to give 'Death Wore A Fabulous New Fragrance' a shot and hopefully the second installment in the series will be a bit better."
1,NOT MDLP RECORDING? This item is in the stone age...,Do not buy a minidisc player that only records/plays for 80 minutes. MDLP units (this is not one of them) give you 5 hours and 20 minutes-at 128kps...even the MDLP units are old technology. I guess this unit would be okay if you just wanted to burn it on a regular cd. I prefer mp3 discs just to save time and money.
4,Good md player,This unit is perfect for me to use in teaching dancing in smallish classrooms. Almost all my music is on minidisks; the rest on CD's that also work on this machine.It isn't for audiophiles or for use in larger spaces.
5,"Dose the job. RS-232, are all Female, BD-9...","12-30-2012 Rev-A.Dose the job. RS-232 connectors are all Female DB-9 (DE-9).This box works just fine. I was a little worried with this looking like the brand I normally buy, but IS NOT. I can switch between my, K3 (& P3) KPA500 and KAT500*, and W2*#, and still have a serial port available. All the boxes RS-232 connectors are all Female.So, for the Elecraft K-Line you will need M-M shielded RS232 cables.* The The DB-9 to Stereo serial cable needs M-M DB-9 adapter (to use this box).# The KAT and the W2 share the same port (I manually move the stereo connector)."
3,Great mids and highs,"I bought these speakers without checking out the specifications, they can be utilized as great midrange and high frequency speakers"
4,"Mixed--Some Gems, Some Meat, Lots of White Space","This book has *huge* amounts of white space, and although it came to me highly recommended, over the course of reading every word I rated it at three stars--not nearly as interesting as, to take one book I especially liked, SNOWCRASH.However, I have raised it to 4 stars because of the gems, such as the loss of the future on page 57, good description of digital watermarking, the enormous distrust of false advertising and false impressions leading to false relations (p 85), the final denouncement of the loss of time and human intimary (p. 302-303), and--overall--the portrayal of web-life, the sympathetic portrayal of Usenet-type groups and their members, the idea of cool ideas and ""cool hunter"", and the overall representation of mobile information and its vulnerabilities to interception.Having said all that, I found this to be very light reading, half the text a book of this sort might have warranted, and on balance, disappointing."
5,Pattern Recognition,"Pattern Recognition is a book far more mainstream than Neuromancer, and is more accessible for the reader of today. Although lacking in storyline and comprehensible plot, the book itself is a work of art. The commentary that Gibson provides on popular culture is priceless, and the stylistic nuances of Gibson's writing are not to be missed. Where else can you find such a sentence as:""It is that flat and spectral non-hour, awash in limbic tides, brainstem stirring fitfully, flashing inappropriate reptilian demands for sex, food, sedation, all of the above, and none really an option now.""Pattern Recognition is truly an excellent book; pick it up, and you'll be immersed in Cayce's world. The book opens your eyes to the level of saturation with advertisements that we experience every day, and provides a new, uncannily right-on view at the psychology of trends."
3,Gibson's Endings STILL Disappoint,"I'm a fan of Gibson's work, yet I still am amazed at how choppy and stilted his endings are compared to the rest of the work. This has got to be one of the worst examples, which is so frustrating given that the other 80% of the novel is incredible (thus I had to give it 3 stars rather than the 5 stars the rest of the novel deserves).If you're a fan of Gibson, you'll enjoy the book, the last 3 or 4 chapters notwithstanding.If you're on the fence about getting this book, [no spoiler here] the ending works, but barely - it could've benefited from another 4-6 chapters of better pacing and story. From his acknowledgment, I gather that Gibson struggled with this book and at least 3 of the last 4 chapters show it.If you're new to Gibson, read some of his other works first...or stop at chapter 40 in this and skip to chapter 43.J. Avellanet, Co-Founder of Cerulean Associates LLC"
3,The Writing Is Better Than The Story,"To begin: Gibson is an amazing writer. So much so that in reading this book I found that I enjoyed the author's word craft more than the story. Gibson employs some of the most intelligent and hip dialogue I've read, though at times the clipped chat room narratives can be annoying. Trying too hard to be hip. Still, and despite a somewhat weak finish, this is a decent read and a must for cool-hunters and steganographers (Google that!) everywhere."
2,Not exactly the authors best work,"I'm a fan of Gibsons, to the point that I waited to buy this novel until I found a autographed edition. It was so not worth the wait. The protaganist, Cayce, is about as interesting a 2 day old bagel after a fine french meal. If she had died in the middle of the book I probably could have cared less. The book starts off slowly with this boring person and really goes nowhere for quite a while. My impressions of the first 100 or so pages is summed up with the constant thoughts of "" I will finish this book, I will not quit reading it"" . The book does pick up toward the final third and becomes more interesting to finish up with a ending that makes the reader say "" so what?"". Really a poor effort from a talented writer."
3,It's okay,"It's a decent book, interesting themes, but the character is forgettable (though he tried to hack together an ""interesting"" character by giving her funny ""quirks""). Not much happens, plotwise, either.A decent read if you're a Gibson fan, but not something I'd recommend to a new reader."
2,Pretty Disappointing,"This is the first of William Gibson's novels that I've read, and I must say that I'm pretty disappointed. Doubly so, because it wasn't something I just picked up off the shelf and decided to read; I had been looking forward to reading it for over a year.The plot was excruciatingly dull, and there was no realism to it at all. I am in the marketing field, and felt more embarrassed by the book than anything. I mean, how could anyone think that the focus of the book--the social implications of ""the footage""--could be that valuable, cause so much of a raucous? Seriously.And the inferred underground and technology was not that appallingly futurific either. I was so looking forward to something that would blow my mind and really make me look at things from a different perspective. This was a huge let down.I have heard that William Gibson's other books are more intriguing and thought provoking though, so I might check those out."
2,Not a pretty pattern,"Gibson's first foray into a present-day setting, this book seems intent on demonstrating just how much cyberpunk has become synonymous with our reality. However, somehow he makes present day tech feel futuristic even when its not - it's kind of odd, really. Setting aside the usual stunningly beautiful prose, there's not much of a story here, and what there is doesn't make a lot of sense. I liked the central character, but never really believed in her. In the end, the only real enjoyment came from the writing itself, and the way gibson sinks the reader into the funkiest underbellies of places like London, Tokyo and Moscow. Other than that, not much to offer. I've know for a long time that Gibson has lost his chops, but I do keep coming back for more, don't I? Weird."
2,"Like refreshing a travel blog for the first 120 pages, then decent, then fizzels","My take may not be quite the same as many other similarly starred reviews- this is my first Gibson book and as he is generally so well reviewed and clearly thinks big thoughts I might give him another try but this was a pretty lackluster plot that fizzled at the end with a bunch of amateur plot closures.For me the first 120 pages nearly did me in- I ended up skimming endless descriptions of London, apartments, markets, coffee houses, etc. The heroine was just compelling enough to stick with it until it gained some momentum with the introduction of an interesting character... only to lose it again and stumble into a rambling face plant. One particular scene involving effigies of the Michelin man had me doing double takes as the least believable, most melodramatic literary moment in recent memory.I stumbled though but largely because I was trapped in China with nothing else to read (or buy."
2,Big expectations - disappointed,"One of the only novels I've ever stopped reading through sheer boredom (although I did pick it up again to give it a chance to redeem itself).A paradigm example of what happens when you create characters that are difficult to sympathize with - the reader just couldn't care less about what they think or what happens to them. Just about every person in this book has unlimited money, unlimited access to the most powerful people on the planet, and inevitably get called 'brilliant in their field of work'. I felt like I was reading a book about the adventures of Bill Gates, Paris Hilton, the Queen of England and the head of the CIA. No resonance with their world, their activities, or opinons.Coupled with an unbelievable and seemingly arbitrary wrap-up of all the plot's mysteries (the phrase deus ex machina comes to mind), I was left very disappointed."
2,A struggle...,"The book takes us into the world of Cayce Pollard, an advertising consultant, with the ability to judge an ad campaign or logo and determine if it will be successful. Pollard also has a strange phobia for certain product logos.The plot involves a fastination with the 'footage'. Small film clips which are being released on the internet by an unknown person(s). Pollard is enlisted to find the creator of the footage. This hunt takes her from London, to Japan, and finally to Russia.I found this book a bit of a struggle. The text rambled, at times, going no where. Some of the plot lines that were introduced were abandonded by the end of the book, leaving open ended questions. This was my first book by Gibson. If you haven't read any of Gibson's other works, I would not recommend starting with 'Pattern Recognition'."
2,Not so hot,"Not worth buying this new -- especially in hardback. This read more like a fluffy summer mystery you'd take to the beach. Very cliched. It seems to me that Cayce's rescue scene involved a tired deus ex machina ploy. Not only that, but the ending was like a Scooby Doo ending. If it weren't for those meddling kids...."
4,Holds up pretty well,"I just got around to reading this very good book, perhaps a little too late. I imagine the impact would've been greater on me had I read this back when it was first published. As it was, I was expecting it to live up to a lot of hype and I came away having enjoyed it quite a bit, but having wanted it to live up to the hype a bit more.I will say that I was right on board all the way up to the somewhat awkward, abbreviated ending. I am fond of the characters but question a couple of things that happened right at the end. A few interesting ideas were not fully explored. Having said that, I'm a huge Gibson fan and this is one of my favorites."
3,A Nice Departure,"It's fun when Gibson leaves his more familiar parallel worlds to visit one more closely related to our own. I found the main character's relationship to the iconography and her reactions to it provocative, if not unsatisfactorily explained. What I didn't love is the utter obliqueness of some aspects of the story. If its like other Gibson books, it really requires a second and third read to completely appreciate. The problem is that I didn't find the story sufficiently compelling that I would choose it for a re-read."
4,Berglund Center for Internet Studies Review by Jeffrey Barlow,"Pattern Recognition, is difficult to summarize. Its heroine, Cayce, is afflicted with an allergic reaction to brands, whether pushed at her from electronic advertisements or attached to her clothing. Tommy Hilfiger is close to life-threatening for her. This, of course, makes her invaluable to the advertising world because her reaction to a planned ad campaign or style is usually a clue to its probable success. Like much fiction that grows out of technology and its impact, Pattern Recognition, is difficult to bring to an end. We are left without knowing whether the film snippets are some vital message to us, or merely the beginning of a wildly successful advertising campaign. But Gibson's striking prose, sharp vision, and colorful world are difficult to forget, long after the reader returns to the mirror world...For a full review see Interface, Volume 3, Issue 2."
3,"Ok, but not great","Books general attitude regarding the web feels dated, the ending is not great... A love story is started up then just let flop. We start getting into things that go no where. Seems like WG is trying to hard to be hip and all techie (note his shoes on the back cover) rather than it feeling natural. Two stars are reserved for the really bad novels, where P.R. is just not good but not bad."
4,Captivated by Cayce Pollard,"I fell in love this book's plucky protagonist and decided she should be played by Chloe Sevigny in the inevitable movie. I seldom read genre novels - science fiction or espionage thrillers - but I was hooked on this incredibly witty look at the popular culture through the eyes of a globe-trotting ""cool hunter.""Yes, the plot turns out to be your standard thriller blueprint, with some mysterious Internet footage serving as the McGuffin instead of a Maltese falcon. Yes, five years (or five minutes) from now, nobody will get the brand references like Duffer of St. George. Yes, the denouement could have been way better. And yes, the tragedy of 9/11 seems grafted on to this plot give it a bit of gravitas. But this page-turner brought back some of the pleasure I remember from reading the James Bond series as it emerged, and Gibson has an astounding grasp of the pop zeitgeist.Great fun."
4,Cayce Pollard fan club,"Once you finish ""Pattern Recognition,"" you may find yourself returning again and again to thoughts of Cayce Pollard, the uniquely contemporary protagonist of Gibson's latest tour-de-zeitgeist. A stylish modern woman who shuns overt style, she's also an independent think who still manages to rely on friends, a thoroughly wired denizen of cyberspace who's completely unselfconscious about it and a uniquely intriguing prototype for living successfully in these times.Learn more about her in ""Pattern Recognition,"" and then join the discussion..."
2,Occupied an afternoon slightly better than eating stale brea,"This was my first William Gibson novel and will be my last. I picked up the read hoping for a thought provoking story with such an intriguing title. I was disappointed to find that the characters were slightly more than one dimensional. Mr. Gibson surely should not have placed a woman as his main character and wrote about her experiences and perceptions as if she were a man. I feel after 300+ pages I know less about the character than a face I see in Starbucks.I do believe that Mr. Gibson wrote this entire book simply to have his allegory of a rose petal to the 911 attacks published.This book was truly a waste of time, and I have had more enjoyable reads while waiting to have a root canal in the dentist's office."
2,A waste of time,"I had read Gibson's Neuromancer several years ago and really enjoyed it. I picked up Pattern Recognition, not really knowing anything about it. Unfortunately, it's about the biggest piece of drivel that I've ever read. The book, at best, would've been better as a short story. As it is, the plot doesn't even begin until about 100 pages into the book. Even then, the plot is just really lame. I can't believe Gibson would even write a book about this."
1,"Prada, pointless and pretentious.","And this guy is considered a good writer? Hard to believe.All this *junk* about fashion, labels, brands and logos. Is this supposed to be deep?Story is weak, slow and uninteresting. The gist of it is about finding the director of a webfilm. As if real people would really care.He got two things right:1. Hitler was great about branding; and2. The dot.com people were all about the money.And I learned about Curtas. So what.And that smary picture on the back cover with the Converse All-Stars and nylon black coat.The thing is the anti-designer/logo fashion thing is it's own statement and label.Complete waste of money and paper."
2,She hunts for cool...and does not find it.,"What can I say...it pretty much sucked. Not science fiction, not cyber punk, not even interesting. The first Gibson book to rate Oprah's Book Club. Look for the movie on the Life Time Network staring Sally Struthers. Avoid this waste of paper at all costs."
2,Don't bother,"I read this book based upon the reviews for Neuromancer. I'm not happy that I did. Sure, there were a lot of words in the book, but they really didn't do anything for me. I thought the characters were second rate (development took FOREVER), I thought the plot was very predictable (and boring), and I thought that I should stop reading it (but didn't).Read some Richard Morgan, you'll get more enjoyment out of it..."
4,Happy Hipness,"This is my second William Gibson novel. I am well on my way to groupiehood. Others have described characters and story line in detail; I will merely say that I believed in the characters and that the story line totally sucked me in. Gibson, no matter how complicated and interwoven his plots grow to be, likes to wrap things up; essentially, I think, he likes happy endings. I do too, so am very satisfied. His description of jet lag . . . the feeling that one's soul remains where one came from, and only slowly finds its way to one's new location . . . will stay with me forever. Must have more Gibson."
4,wow,"I am generally hard to please, but I was very satisfied with this book. It is not an action thriller, but it has a very reasonable intrigue, while the intrigue is developing at a slow pace it keeps you interested and the action line is not something incredibly stupid, characters are well developed and believable, there are no idiotic sex scenes, the action takes reader to well described exotic places, it is not boring etc etc etc. In other words it is a pretty entertaining read for an adult reader.There were a couple of things that annoyed me at the beginning. First, overall volvo-liberal environment, but I would admit that it is pretty natural for people working on the creative side of branding/advertising/market development to be volvo-liberals. Second, I was suspicious about male writer describing inner workings of a woman's soul, but it came out OK, too.Overall, I would say it is well worth money I spent on this book."
2,What Happened?,"This was easily the most disappointing book I have read so far this year. Gibson is, or at least was, capable of better. Cayce Pollard was an interesting character in the beginning and had interesting possibilities but was not fully developed or explored.The book jumped around in search of a theme / purpose. There was Cayce's search for her father, which never went anywhere. There was the brief introduction to her mother, which never went anywhere. There was the main plot element in the book: ""the footage"" which again, never really went anywhere. In the end, the producers of the footage are found, and there is no point to any of it other than the fact that some people where making it and Cayce found them. No big revelation or hidden twist. Ummmm... OK.Save yourself the money and don't read this. Seriously, it just isn't worth the time or money with so many other good books out there."
4,"Can be maddening, but gets you.","There is such an overwhelming direction in this book to get to the bottom of who supplied the images in ""The Footage"" that it's nerve testing. The details grow exceptionally, not a problem to follow, it just adds to the suspense. I did not like the useage of 911 missing persons at all though. This is a future time travel suspense novel which will entertain you but leave you simply entertained as there really isnt much here to believe in. I just finished SB or God by Karl Maddox, another future recognition novel I highly recommend."
2,"Good start, bad finish...","I have been a reader of Gibson since the ""Burning Chrome"" collection, and I have been less and less enamoured of his work as time has passed.In spite of a great premise and some good characters, ""Pattern Recognition"" fail in the end, when Gibson is unable to sustain the mystery and give us a decent payoff. After all the build-up regarding the ""footage"", the resolution is so flat I re-read it to make sure I hadn't missed anything. Unfortunately, I hadn't.This will be the last Gibson novel I pick up, because he is no longer cutting edge/visionary/intriguing - (...)"
3,"Same old, same old","I started reading the book with high hopes. I loved ""Neuromancer"" and ""Count Zero"" but I found Williab Gibsons subsequent books more and more repetitive. ""Pattern Recognition"" takes place now or in the very near future and doesn't use any advanced technology. You can believe that everything he talks about can happen now. So I was hopping that this book would be different. Unfortunatelly, it is not. Same themes, similar characters, and recycled plots. Don't get me wrong. It is easy to go through and I never got bored. But it doesn't offer anything new to people familiar with Gibsons earlier work."
2,not the William Gibson i found in 1988,"After the last fiasco (all tomorrows parties) i figured Gibson was due for a come back. didn't happen. at least he drops all pretense of sci-fi. none here. has a few high points but in the end never really gets worked out very well. you would think he would know about the dangers of trying to cross over like Phillip K. tried to do...some decent lines in the book and not terrible as a modern day tale, but not the Gibson of legend...try Bruce Sterlings ""Holy Fire"" if you need a fix."
2,So this was about...?,"Style: neat.Characters: There were characters?Plot: From a conference room in London to a post-Soviet prison, with some schlock about web footage and 9.11 to make the story hip.Synopsis: One-dimensional characters participate in an apparently useless quest for some mostly useless information. The storyline makes little sense, and the ending is completely unsatisfying.Not worth your time."
4,fascinating/absolutey worth reading.,"I had never read a Gibson book, and don't regularly read read sci-fi novels. I really enjoyed this book and found it both intellectually engaging and suspenseful. Especially interesting was the language and sentence structure. The language was both modern and beautiful. I have read many modern novels with ""hip"" use of language but they usually come out rather gritty-sounding, whereas Gibson uses a voice that is both modern in its efficiency and graceful at the same time."
4,Evocative storytelling,"I did not think much of the story that PR tells. I did not connect at all with its characters. But I'd still rate PR highly. No matter how little I might care to inhabit the world of PR, I must concede that WG does a masterful job of evoking it."
3,Not fully developed,"The basic ideas behind this book and the characters and world created are really quite interesting, but I feel the story plot wasn't polished enough. The good guy vs. bad guy is too simplistic. He weaves Cayce's father into the story pretty intricately... and then doesn't do anything with it, it almost seems like filler - both of her parents can be extracted from the story and it's pretty much the same. I think they were added to justify the interest of the bad guys in Cayce.In short, I wanted Gibson to dive more into the ""Pattern Recognition"" ideas and groundwork and less into the cliche ""mafia's out to get me"" type of drama."
3,Conceptual genius that may be hard to follow...,"Pattern Recognition is a solid novel with an interesting plot but was, for me, too slow to develop. Gibson solid grasp of technology is hard to understand sometimes, even for those of us who are mildly savvy. Pattern Recognition is a good science fiction novel, just not for me."
4,Amazingish...,"I really did like this book. It was a little boring at first but once you get into it, it is hard to put down."
2,Please stop,"I'm a fan of William Gibson's earlier work, but this book was simply bad. There were a couple of cool ideas, such as the main character's alergic reaction to branding, but the story just didn't go anywhere. There was little action, and not much real character development. A few characters where thrown in for reasons that were never made clear, I suppose they were filler. In the end, the ""big mystery"" isn't very mysterious at all -- this was one of the most disappointing books I've read all the way through. Usually I would have stopped about 1/2 way through, but since it was William Gibson I gave him the benefit of the doubt.Save your money, save your time, read something else. Try Jennifer Government, for example."
2,SciFi Not,"After reading several works by Gibson, I have to admit being slightly puzzled at what he is writing.SciFi is not horror, and not fantasy.SciFi is supposed to be about ""what if"" and ""science."" It also contains Adventure, and technology. It contains history, sociology, politics, economics and logic.Gibson sometimes produces something close to science fiction and close to adventure.But not always and not this time.PeteDSL"
2,"Cyber...what, exactly?","So our futuristic anti-hero, Case, has been retrofitted into Cayce. Big deal, Bill! A character allergic to advertising. Aren't we all! I like the idea of Gibson trying to write about our time; after all, he practically invented our present. Unfortunately, our present is only interesting to future historians. Give us what we really want: a history of the day after tomorrow!Still luv ya, Bill! Better luck next time!"
2,lots of text about nothing much really,"The book focuses on style instead of content. It does a good job on the style front and it's readable. Unfortunately the story line is practically nonexistent. The little that is there doesn't fit well logically and in the very end things are explained with information and additional characters yanked out of the blue. Very unsatisfying ending. It's like those old detective stories where in the end it turns out that the murderer was the gardener or cook who was mentioned in a half sentence in the whole book. Gibson's book feels like this, except the gardener doesn't even get a half sentence.It feels as if Gibson wanted to write a book about cool but had no ideas for a real story line. You get everything from leather jackets, to anime but not much originality and creativity.One thing the book certainly deserves: the title for the worlds longest written Apple commercial."
4,Recognize This,"A good novel, the first I read by Gibson. I heard a lot about the guy, him being the godfather of cyberpunk and everything so I expected alot of pyrotechnics and stuff. What I got was an unexpectedly understated story. Cayce Pollard too is a very understated person working in the marketing business where everything is about overstatement. So yeah I was hoping for a rollercoaster ride through cyberspace and come out screaming woooo! But I'm glad I got this book instead. BTW this book is so cool it's even got a character from Belgium! (his name is Bigend though, not funny)"
4,Gibson Shines,Gibson's past books have been very techno heavy - so much so that they have overshadowed his skills as a great writer of fiction. Pattern recognition is his first book that is accessible to the casual reader. As a result I was blown away with his abilities as a writer - the description of places and people was incredible. This is Gibson taken to a new level.
4,"Definately Gibson, but very different","This is an abstract book that tells it's story through concepts and notions instead of standard story telling. I loved it, but my girlfriend didn't really get it. Gibson's writing style has definately matured, but the story doesn't have the enthusiasm as Neuromancer."
3,Your basic Gibson work,"While much has been made of this book's supposed departure from the author's usual genre, it's basically just another Gibson novel. Gibson repeats his tendency to come up with truly unique characters and really fascinating ideas, explore them very cleverly for a while, and then quit the book without bringing them to any satisfying conclusion.Some people forgive this more easily than others, so I guess the bottom line is, Gibson fans will likely enjoy this book; people who've found any of his previous books disappointing will not be encouraged by this one."
3,Revisit The Present Tense,"I didn't find this book boring. Far from it. While it isn't phenomenal or groundbreaking as some of Gibson's other works are, it does cast our world in a different light. Particularly our society's fascination with designer labels and 'Net subculture.The book is a moody piece of work. Hip but not daring. Slow but always fascinating. I'm not going to rundown the plot, as others have already done so. I will say something about the ending, which is a bit of a letdown. Your mind has a million, more satisfying ideas about where the plot could have led. Instead, it ends up being rather pedestrian and the book suffers for it, particularly since its something of a detective story. Everything about the book is leading towards it and then it just...ends. Blah."
2,Very slow read,"I like books that catch your interest in the first page, and hold your attention page after page. This book didn't do that for me. It is 367 pages long. I read the first 60 pages and there was nothing happening...not a single incident where you say, ""Ahha, this could be good!""The author used a very interesting style in some of his sentences that I have not seen before. They weren't complete sentences, but you could understand what he was saying. Great new idea.The main character was uninteresting, except that she had a very unusual job (she is hired by companies to spot trends for the future, to help them develop and market new products.) She could have been quite an attention-grabber, but that didn't materialize...she was just an odd person moving through an uneventful life.WIth no intrigue, no exciting events, nothing to make you say, ""I wonder what will happen next?"", I gave up at page 60 and threw the book away."
3,A casual read,"Pros: The marketing and advertising concepts are interesting in Pattern Recognition. Cayce is a really interesting character who was fun to read about. The book reads casually and fluently which I found to be enjoyable.Cons: There wasn't anything epic or life changing in this book. I was mislead to thinking this was going to actually be sci-fi or at least a little more fictitious. Seemed more like a real story currently happening to someone.Other Thoughts: I think Gibson writes so well that this book was enjoyable just because of the way it reads. Don't let the cons of this book keep you from reading it. It most likely wont be the best thing you'll have ever read, but it is thoughtful and engaging. I also suggest you read it to get to know the character Cayce whom is easy to relate to and has stayed with me after finishing this book."
2,Boooooring...did William Gibson really write this book?,"Other than spatterings of his wonderfully illustrative prose, this book doesn't even seem Gibson-ish (to coin a term). I can see why this book was on the bargain rack at my local bookstore. This book represents 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back. Boring!!!"
2,Couldn't wait to finish so that I could stop being bored.,"This is the first novel in a long time that made no connection with me at all. I didn't care about the characters, much less like them. I couldn't understand exactly why the characters cared about ""the footage"" or why they were willing to go to such extremes over it. But I kept hoping that by the end of the novel the author would put it all together and make me see why they cared so much. He didn't, and I was glad that it was over."
2,Gibson's pretty much done,"No more plot, not much character...this is the new Gibson. He langorously winds his way through page after page of description of night clubs, new products, international manufacturing trends...and we, the reader are left standing around while he ruminates. The fresh breath of hip he injected into SF in the mid 80's is very much dated now and labored. He's been imitated so much that he now comes off as a pale imitation of himself.Idoru and All Tomorrow's Parties were much the same. Virtual Light was really his last good book."
4,makes me want to clean up my room,"A highly personal identification with the main character made me want to clean up my room and sand off the logos off some of personal clothing and accessories. An engrossing read that at points gives the impression it's going to finish a little too neatly, yet doesn't finish in quite the way I expected. Still, the sources of power discovered at the end are a little too extreme and therefore simplistic and too easy a solution for the intricacies explored earlier."
4,best since neuromancer,"Gibson seems, at long last, to be getting older. This new novel doesn't always have the frenetic pace of the Neuromancer books, but in ""Pattern Recognition"" he has rediscovered the writing style that made his first book so damn good. As always, it is his little insights into culture and to the ways we relate to our technology that makes this book work. Might have liked to see the anti-materialism/anti-brand name/anti-commodification sentiments reconciled with the 9/11 American experience. Both of these figure heavily in the book, but are largely treated as two separate issues. And maybe they are...Point is, Gibson gets you thinking and looking DIFFERENTLY at the world around us. And he throws in some useful slang: ""Lombard"" and ""MAWG"" to name two. Wondering if Bill G. is seeing himself as the MAWG -- a little midlife crisis creeping in perhaps. Read it if you like Gibson and were a lil disappointed with everything he's put out since that first one in 1984."
5,Years later...,"I read this book more a little more than 2 years ago and finished it on an airplane. I was so obviously happy reading it that the person sitting next to me asked about it. I ended up giving it to him since after I described it he really wanted to read it, but have regretted ever since not having my own copy. I am not a traditional science fiction fan, but this is a book I'm still thinking about."
3,"Excellent writing, interesting topics, poor development...","I've never been a big Gibson fan; read Neuromancer and was dissapointed. However, the guy did help spawn an entire genre of Science Fiction so I thought I'd give his most recent work a shot; by my definition that means give him 50 pages of my time, if I'm not sucked in, I'll bail.Well, he succeeded in sucking me in. He's a wonderful creative writer and his sentences are like neural candy, organized beautifully, creatively, and with a real unique ""cool"" style (you'll pick up some new jargon, as well as some trendy concepts). Unfortunately, the story never quite matured the way I'd hoped it would, and I thought the ending was surprisingly poor.Waste of time? Well that depends on who you are I guess, but as busy and involved I am with my daily life I'd call this a worthwhile investment of most peoples time..."
1,BORING!,"I read 100 pages & I'm kicking myself for having wasted that much time. Characterization was never Gibson's strongest point, but these characters aren't just one-dimensional, they're NO-dimensional. The heroine is determinedly anti-fashion and is allergic to certain trademarks....believe me, you won't care. Her name is Cayce Pollard so her clothes are CPUs--Casey Pollard Units. This is what passes for wit. The book contains one of the most annoying mannerisms I've encountered in years: In the first chapter, the American heroine, waking up in London, notices that electrical outlets are different, the English drive on the other side of the road, etc., so she dubs England ""mirror-world"". From then on, any reference to an English object or custom is accompanied by the adjective ""mirror-world"". It wasn't especially clever the first time, and it is maddening after 50 repititions. Gibson needs to find some fresh ideas, his last three books have been awful."
1,What happened to Gibson?,"Boring. Boring characters, boring plot (if you can call it a plot). I have admired Gibson deeply over the years, and have studied his writing because he can draw a character more vividly, and in fewer words, than any author I've ever encountered in any genre. What he leaves unsaid in his novels (i.e. in his previous novels) is what makes the biggest impact of all on the reader, and that is a gift that is beyond deciphering; it can only be relished. Pattern Recognition is a total failure. But then, even great authors are allowed to fail. And Gibson remains a great author, this lemon notwithstanding."
2,Too Cool,"I hate to be the first less than glowing review here, but I was let down by Gibson's latest work. The social anomie and alienation here is more tangible than the text, plot or characters. With the plot moving as slow as molasses, circling around images on the internet, and halting to explore strange looking calculators, I felt this work was held together by tone alone. Granted the language is beautiful but the work tried to explore advertising and globalization (according to the bookjacket) yet I feel I've seen these dim glances before. I feel the My Year of Meats (Ruth Ozeki) much more powerfully did what Pattern Recognition thought it was trying. The book is worth reading simply because it's Gibson looking at the present."
4,patterns,"Pattern Recognition was not much fun to read. I found myself having to back up several times just to figure out where I was, who I was with, and what we were doing. Gibson introduced some neat ideas, like ""coolhunting,"" but they went mostly undeveloped. When I look back now, 15 minutes after finishing the book, I see darkness, some half-grasped plot points whirling around like street trash in the wind...and I'm a good reader. I wanted to like Cayce, but there wasn't enough of her to like, or the other characters either. The whole novel seemed to pick up and discard elements of modern life--modern wealthy life, that is--with abandon. I thought the ending was less than satisfying. Yay, happy ending. I was more relieved than anything else. Having committed my time and money to the book, I couldn't just not finish."
3,Somewhat mediocre.,"It is a very relevant book, however, it isn't without flaws.I found the pacing of the book to be very bothersome. The glue between several major ""places"" in the book simply wasn't there. Also, in my opinion, there are some unnecessary characters in this book.I liked the descriptive style but by the end, I noticed a pervading ""emptiness"" to the book as a whole. The main character had an ""alien"" quality that simply didn't allow me to empathize with them.Great concept, but just ""ok"" writing."
3,Start of a decline,"I have always liked Gibson's work, but Pattern Recognition is the start of a gradual decline. His books were thought-prevoking and unique, but now seem cliched.My biggest gripe about the book is that all the characters feel like they grew up reading too many Gibson books: that is, they feel like you would never meet them in real life. Previous works by Gibson didn't have that. The characters were much more believable. So it is harder to feel anything for the people in the book.The story itself is decent, but again a lot of things that seem a bit made up and unrealistic. Gibson's previous works were engaging because they did seem believable - even for the future, but the closer to today he comes, the less believable his stories get."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Corporate cyber coolhunting.William Gibson continues to regress technologically it seems, back to pretty much the present day. Seems we have a case of a science fiction writer not being able to hack it as a science fiction writer anymore.Maybe not surprising considering the drugged out, arty past with no real interest in or knowledge of technology earlier in life, if what you can read about him is correct.Maybe he'll end up writing about caveman and the wheel if he lives long enough. :)So, after having a crack at the media industry, why not advertising and marketing, this time?Dodgy characters and computer hacking etc. are still present, though, surrounding a film mystery."
3,not too bad,"This is my first Gibson book to read. An acceptable read with an overly simplified ending, but worth the $."
2,2-1/2 stars - a weak pseudo-spy novel,"Cayce Pollard is a fashion consultant hired to find the maker of a mysterious auteur film that's slowly being leaked onto the Internet. As she bounces around the globe following clues, others are after her for various nefarious reasons.I love Gibson's first three novels, but now he's abandoned cyberpunk and moved on to... well, whatever this is. PR comes across as an imitation of a spy novel by someone who doesn't understand the genre. Yes, there are attempts to create a paranoid/who-can-you-trust vibe, but they fall flat through inept handling. The ""twists"" thrown in aren't so much surprises as eye-rolling contrivances. There are also huge chunks of this book where nothing happens, making it a tedious read at times. At least he's abandoned his stunted prose experiment that made All Tomorrow's Parties such a painful read.100 pages in, I debated if I wanted to follow through and finish it. I should have followed my gut and returned it to the library."
3,New Direction for Gibson?,"Like Spook country, which I read shortly before this, Pattern Recognition is starting to go in a new direction with Gibson's books. Less crazy chaotic drug use and no jacking into the net. The new direction seems to be more about quirky characters, nuanced fashion and social details. He still presents new ideas for where society may going with tech, and the implications of what it means to be rich in the near future -- which is what seals the deal for me.I did find his earlier works (Count Zero, Neuromancer, All tomorrow's parties, etc.) to be more satisfying, but I was happy enough with this as is."
5,Prescient,"""Pattern Recognition,"" beyond being a well-written and enjoyable novel, was extremely prescient. Basically foreseeing the revolution that encompasses globally (more or less) available rich-media content via the internet...think YouTube, for instance...Gibson saw a future that came to be.Moreover, one of the key threads to the book's plot, that of a mysterious video that attracts a worldwide audience and following, was played out nearly as written in ""Pattern Recognition"" in the year 2006 via a series of videos that attracted wide media attraction and interest.This is an engrossing read that happens to have foreseen a wide-ranging phenomenon that, at the time of the book's publication, did not exist."
2,A Complete Disappointment,"This is a dangerous and ultimately disappointing book for the writer.By setting Pattern Recognition in the present, Mr. Gibson aims to lend his cynical, ""cyber-punk"" eye to the (presumably oppressive) uniculture that America is exporting. The problem isn't that it's a lazy device, though it is. Or that it lends itself to the kind of armchair, pedantic observation that you're supposed to grow out of after college. It's that Mr. Gibson succumbs to the tyranny he tries to observe.This is less a novel than a numbing series of lists. Where there should be plot, he gives us vaguely connected riffs about the emptiness of Tommy Hilfiger and plasma TV. But the real heartbreaker is that the man who wrote perhaps the best opening sentence of all time -- ""The sky...was the color of a television, tuned to a dead channel"" -- is hacking here.Pray he rediscovers his chops, because you won't recognize them in Pattern Recognition."
1,My Brain Hurts,"This book has been around my office, and not in a good way. One person in the office bought it because he is a fan of William Gibson's other works. He wasn't able to finish the first 20 pages. Feeling he might have been bias for some reason, he passed it on to a co-worker, not revealing any of his feelings for the book in an attempt to get an untainted reaction. That co-worker finished 21 pages before giving up. It was then passed on to me. I finished three. This book is horrific for anyone who has any sense of grammar at all. The fragmented sentences, insane use of commas, and mundane detail destroy any interest I could have possibly developed for the characters themselves. I see reviews critiquing the plot, but I must admit, I could not see the plot through all of the horrible writing. How this book made it past a publisher, I have no idea."
1,Watching Paint Dry,This is probably one of the most boring and uneventful novels I have ever read. Most of it seems to be centred around Camden Town in London where the main character lives and doesn't really move away from there. Getting through the first 150 pages was dreadful and I gave up in the end. This is my first Gibson book - and probably my last!
5,one of my favorites,"I've been a big Gibson fan since the old-school cyberpunk stuff (I think Burning Chrome was the first book of his I ever read), and I have read and enjoyed most of his work. That being said, Pattern Recognition was one of my favorites. It keeps his noir style, but without as much of the technological fantasy of his earlier cyberpunk work. That is not to say that technology is absent in Pattern Recognition, but rather that it is a more realistic technological near-future tale. I love the way the story unfolds, and keeps the readers interest for the whole book. I read this book straight through without stopping."
4,Gibsons Modern Day Cyberpunk...,"While Gibson is probably most known for his Sprawl series, Pattern Recognition is a brilliant look into the modern day world of cyber culture. While reading this excellent book I don't see ay ""science fiction"" in the book, Call it ""Hard science fiction"", a more mature approach, but this is an excellent read!! there may be no street samurais but there is plenty of hi tech suspense"
2,A disappointment from Gibson.,"Took two attempts to make it through this one. Not exactly gripping. It feels like the story is all about nothing, and the lead character has no control or even any clue as to what is going on. And boy is it repetitive. Mirror world this, mirror world that, the duck thing, the labels thing.I've really enjoyed his work before, this one though completely misses the mark."
1,Bad Recording,"Pretty bad set. No labels on CDs, and very poor quality sound. Don't buy this cd. Choices of songs was good."
1,crappy old book,this book is so old the pages are brittle and brown. i was charged 5.00 for shipping for a paperback book that was not even 1 inch thick in a small envelope. what a rip off. connie wagner
3,Writer's Market,This book has great potential for readers to find major locations for sending articles to be published. The book is short on locations and publications in a very large industry--tourism. I would not recommend the book for travel writers.
3,Basic information for fiction and non-fiction writers,"I found the Writer's Market 2007 Deluxe Edition by Robert Lee Brewer to be informative; however, I had already located another publication that led me to the sources that I sought for promoting MY book.Nonetheless, the Writer's Market is now a part of my book publishing/marketing reference resources collection.Also, regardless of which book/magazine used as a source of information, it is ultimately up to the individual(s) to do the ""leg work,"" or delegate the efforts to someone/others, in their particular promotion efforts.At any rate, I believe that the book is worth purchasing.Jane L.

3,Not nearly as good as the original,"This battery does not last nearly as long as the fresh original one. Probably less than 50% of original capacity. Better than the depleted original, but below expectations."
2,LG1100aMh 3.7 V Battery,"We ordered 3 LG1100aMh 3.7 V Batteries - 1 works perfectly, 1 loses it charge relatively quickly and the 3rd will not retain the charge at all. All 3 were supposed to be new batteries. The goal of getting the batteries was to keep the current cell phone by having batteries available instead of paying ridiculous prices for a phone with features that are not needed and plans that require more than what you want. If all 3 batteries had worked properly I would have rated it a 5."
5,LG1100nAh,"The Verizon store said they didn't make have these batteries as my phone was ""too old"". I went on line, purchased the battery for $5 (Verizon would have charged me $50 if they had it) and it is perfect. My phone came back to life and I'm 100% pleased."
5,"Fast Delivery, Great Battery","I ordered this battery from CCMACCESSORIES on March 19 and I received it on March 20! The battery was brand new. It accomodated my cell phone and it's working perfectly! It might not be the least expensive battery around but it still cost about $17.00, way less than if I bought it else where. I'd rather pay a little more and receive a new battery with over night delivery. I didn't pay extra for the fast delivery either. Worth every penny!"
1,"Don""t buy this!",After one week its dead! Full charge and one 3 min. call and its dead. Not worth sending back probley get the same back. Like they say you get what you pay for!
5,"Great value, good solution","Good product, great price, fast delivery. My cell phone works like new now. What's not to love?"
5,Great Quality,"This is an excellent battery, holding its charge for a very long period. I now only need to charge it once in two or three weeks!"
1,THEY DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS ONE!,"I ordered the 2004 Mid Size version because I had purchased the 2003 Mid Size edition last Spring. I liked the size of this atlas and was eager to get this 2004. I just got it today and I am REALLY DISAPPOINTED! The spiral-bound version is nice, but for some reason Rand-McNally decided to make this atlas a travel guide. Maybe this is what they consider ""deluxe"".The first half is devoted to major cities in the U.S. and tourist attractions. I had to page quite a way through the atlas before I arrived at any road maps. I am going to flag the first page of the actual maps with a post-it so I can get to what I REALLY need when I need it.Last years Mid Size version (Not the Deluxe) was really nice. I even leant it to some friends for their vacation and was going to buy them the new edition when it came out. I think I will go with the 2003 Mid-size (NOT Deluxe) version for them."

5,RAINING LAUGHTER,"AS WITH ALL OF ""HOUSE OF PAYNE"" SERIES I LOVE TO WATCH TO LAUGH.IT IS TEAR JERKING LAUGHTER. I LOVE IT.I EAGERLY AWAIT THE NEXT VOLUME."
3,"Easy to hold, but very hard material","This toy is easy to hold, but with an excitable young baby you need to be careful. This is a very hard plastic and if they hit themselves in the face or body from swinging it around it will leave a painful mark. Seems like they could have buffered this with a softer material somehow to make it better."
5,Another Favorite!,"My son loves to hold this rattle by the handle in the back and chew on either the tail or the small fin on top of the sea horse's head. He also likes to feel and spin the three rings on the body of the seahorse. Lately, though, he has been using it as a tool to bang on things, which is actually kind of funny. Mostly I got this because seahorses are among my favorite animals and we have a lot of toys from the ocean wonders line, but this rattle has been a huge hit with my now 7-month-old. I got it along with the fish rattle and both are durable and good for my son to teethe on, especially since he doesn't seem to care for the cold teething toys."
4,Great rattle,"This has been a great rattle for our daughter - easy to grasp and lots of colors and textures to explore. As she has started to teeth more it has been something she seems to like chewing on too. Plus, her nursery happens to have a sea life theme - so this fits in perfectly."
4,"Good, for the most part.","I put this on my four year olds fingernails, and after a while she began to not mind the taste. She quit chewing on her fingernails, because she was sick of having to sit still to have the polish applied. So for the most part the polish worked, but mostly as a threat to quit chewing."
2,Worked for a few minutes...,My 3.5yr old is a chronic thumb sucker. Orthodontist recommended based on results from other patients. My son said it tasted yucky and wouldn't suck his thumb for an hour or so but then he just didn't seem to care after that. But he's stubborn. Seems to work for a lot of other people and I'm thinking about trying with my older son to stop nail biting.
1,Sent me the wrong product!,they sent me the wrong product! I wanted the mavala stop and instead I got some nail strengthening polish. I couldn't send it back because it looked so similar so I threw away the packaging. It was only after I used it that I noticed it was different.
4,Mavala stop,"I thought this product was very good, but it didn't work for my 3 year old son. He continued to bite his nails even with the bitter taste. It does deter him a little because when I say I'm going to put it on, he says ""No""."
2,Thumbsucker just won't quit,"I got excited at first with Mavala Stop because my 4 year old hated the taste and wouldn't put his thumb in his mouth for two days. But, his overwhelming desire to suck his thumb overruled the unpleasant taste and even though I put Mavala stop on his thumb every day he continues to suck it. Now what?"
1,Did not work for my 3 year old,"I used Mavala on my 3 year old son's thumb in my attempt to stop him from sucking his thumb and it did not work. He did not like the taste but he did not care... he just kept sucking his thumb. When I asked him if it tasted bad, he said yeah, but obviously not enough for him to stop putting his thumb in his mouth."
4,Mavala Stop-this stuff really works!,Couldn't get my son to keep his thumb out of his mouth or my husband to stop chewing his nails. Ordered a bottle of Mavala Stop and the taste was so bad it got their attention quick. (Just like it's supposed to do.) Now when I see my son thinking of sticking his thumb in his mouth he remembers the taste and thinks better of it. This is helping him break a bad habit. It reminds my husband to stop chewing/biting his nails as well.
3,Doesn't work for 2 1/2 year old.,"I'm going to try again when my daughter turns 3 years old and see if the taste bothers her more then. I've heard children don't have developed taste buds until about 3. It stays on just a little bit better than other stuff I bought, but it's pretty much the same. I have to reapply it a couple times a day. I tried it for 3 days straight, with it constantly on her, and it either came off enough that she didn't care about it, or she got used to the taste or stopped caring that it tasted bad."
3,Not Ideal for young children,"I bought this product to help my 4 year-old kick her thumb-sucking habit. She did NOT suck her thumb while it was on her. However, she still uses her hands to eat with, and just brushing her thumb across her lips produced gagging and fussing. She seemed unable to eat without this occurring several times per meal. I felt it too harsh to continue, but removing it was difficult. This would work better on an older child or adult who WANTS to give up thumb-sucking/fingernail biting."
3,wasnt the best...,"i didnt think that the toy waas so mind bowing at all... building it just hurt your fingers and that is the fun part??? when you even barely push it, it falls over so you have to re-build it... personally i think that the musical ferris wheel is the best!!!"
5,Excellent,This thing is awesome. The car goes so fast and it helps you learn about physics. It took me about 6 hours to build. It will keep you busy. After all i would give it a 5 out of 7.
5,WOW,My son (9yo) is on day two of putting this together with his dad and is having a blast!! This is by far the best gift he got for Christmas. Can't wait to see it together and running.
5,Finally a toy i did not mind to put together.,"My son and i who is 5 took five hours over 5 days to finish. This is a great project for a father or mother and a child.What makes this great is when you are done it really works, what a relief that was. .The only mistake i made was i put the boosters on backwards. My son wants to put the pinball machine together next. This is truley a great product. My son loves knex. john g and lori"
3,A new slant,"Most bios of JBKO treat her relationship with her mother only superficially, concentrating instead on how she adored her charismatic father. This book shines the light on Janet, which is a welcome change. While I applaud the new approach, I'm afraid it's not entirely successful. It includes many Janet stories, and almost as much about Jackie, but disappointingly little about Janet AND Jackie. I also wish that Lee and her relationship with Janet and Jackie had been explored more. Still, this book is an entertaining and credible read. I especially appreciated the part where Janet confronts her Senatorial son-in-law regarding his behavior after Jackie loses a baby. Mrs. Auchincloss behaved just as my, or other good mother, would."
3,Janet As A Real Person,"All books I have previously read portrayed Jacqueline Kennedy's mother, Janet, as rather a one dimensional character whose main focus in life was social climbing. Ms. Pottker has fleshed her out into a real human being with foibles and strengths like everyone else. I would have liked to see more of the dynamics between mother and daughter, but nevertheless found this book interesting. Even though Jacqueline herself seems to have had more love and tolerance for her father, it was her mother that was the bigger influence in her life. In divorce the non custodial parent quite often spends the time spent with the children inpursuit of giving the children a good time, buying things, etc. However, it is the custodial parent who has to establish discipline, study habits, etc. Consequently the children recall more fondly the good times versus the day to day normalacy. The author has given a new look at the life of Janet Lee."
5,A great read!!,"Reading this book makes me feel as if I were in a time capsule back into the era when Janet Lee Bouvier Auchincloss lived..this book is an excellent biographical sketch of who and what shaped our future First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy..the book has historical value into the era of the 20's and 30's...the author writes beautifully, with interesting phrases..pg 99 ""One martini, two martinis, three martini's, floor"" !! I enjoyed it very much!"
2,A disappointment,"Despite lengthy notes and a huge bibliography, there is little new in this book about either Jackie or her mother, Janet Auchincloss. It is also hard to believe that a book so supposedly well researched is so badly written. There is no insight into the mother-daughter relationship - and only a sprinkling of new information about either of them. It would have been very interesting to read about Jackie's half-siblings - Janet Jr., who she loved and Jamie, who she did not. Jamie was even barred from her funeral until he protested. Why? No explanation is given. Also nothing new in the area of the whole Jackie-Lee Radziwill dynamic, which also would have been a new and welcome area to explore. Again, nothing new. Disappointing overall."
2,What a bore,The first half of this book reads like a family bible. Who married whom and how many children they had. Boring. The story is very slow and holds no real interest.The second half of the book is a little more interesting. A few little known notes on Jackie.This really is an awful book.
2,almost unintelligible!,"True, there are many stories on this set, but they are badly told and almost unintelligible with a lot of hiss throughout. I was very disappointed. My advice; listen to tracks before you buy to see if the stories sound good and are entertainingly told! All classics are not created equal!"
4,Easy tips and quick results,"The book is first of all very nicely done. The tips and exercises are simple and quick to get started with. I appreciate the fact that she allows us to see some real pictures of her being not so beautiful. I wish there were more meals on the go in the nutrition area. As long as women realize that she has a natural beauty that many of us do not have, then you will appreciate where she is coming from a little more. It's almost impossible to do all of the things we need to do for and with our bodies and especially with little kids underfoot. This is the perfect book to combine with the new revision of Mommy-CEO, 2001, by family expert, Jodie Lynn. The two only adds to the whole family routine of taking care of mommy. Mommy-CEO shows us how to get the kids motivated and Model Mommy shows us how and what to do to take care of ourselves. Both authors stress mommy time and creating space for moms."
5,Works well,It fits - works very well - quality looks good from what I can tell . Probably could not be much better.
1,Clasp wasn't secure,The watch is beautiful but the clasp isn't very secure and the watch could be easily lost
1,"Good Shield, Poor Fit","I've bought and used several BoxWave products and never had a problem. However, the shield for this camera is about 1/16"" short horizontally. Not worth going the trouble of buying a competitive product, but I'm disappointed with the fit."
3,Floral Design,"This book has lots of ideas but not necessarily in tune with today's Flower Show Designs. For the person who wants a pretty centerpiece and feels helpless, this is certainly a book for them."
2,Disappointed with policy not product,"Imagine my disappointment when the floral design class I registered for was canceled due to lack of enrollment. I had already ordered the textbook through doraemoni, a used book seller on Amazon. I immediately notified doreamoni of the problem and when the book arrived, without opening it, I took it to the post office to return. I was told by the USPS that I could refuse the package. Within a few weeks I was notified by Amazon that I would receive a refund. Here is the problem.I paid $108.96 for the book--that included 3.99 for shipping.My refund was $89.22.The reason? A restocking fee (15% off the book price) was applied.5. Shipping and handling charges for returning the item are borneby the buyer. We charge 15% off the book price (or minimum $9)handling fee on each return item. We will refund shipping andhandling charges only if your item was damaged, defective orshipped to you in error."
3,So So,I didn't think the book was as good a quality as the listing led me to believe. There's been water damage and there are scribbles on many pages. It works though and was cheaper than buying it in my school bookstore.
2,Floral Design,"The content of the book was in good condition, but the cover of the book was split in half and not in A1 condition. I was disappointed in that."
5,Textbook Style Book,"This is a great book. It is a textbook style book, so it is a little on the technical side. If you are interested in retail floristry then you will find it to be a great book. But if you are a hobbyist or are looking for a book to give you ideas for arrangements to place around the house/office this book maybe more technical than you want."
3,You can learn a lot if you don't fall asleep first.,"I am currently enrolled in a floral design program using this book as text. Yes, it is a very imformative book, but Ms. Hunter goes into far to much detail and uses far to many words to get her point across. Maybe it's just me and I am a far more visually oriented person, but trying to learn floral design through the use of a text book so far is not my cup of tea...I think it's a good reference book but that's about it."
3,Nothing special,"A small, square-shaped book. It contains translations to a few ""foreign words"", such as coup d'etat, etc. It's really nothing special, I suppose most people already know the meaning of these words."
2,note size,"book is 15 X 10 X 2.5 cm with 366 pages..devanagari script to english only. you must have full fluid recognitionand understanding of devanagari script and its sequence.for me, just reading the tiny script was just too much..my eyes were watering after ten minutes trying..i have used it a few times - with magnifying glass - but be aware of thisbasic limitation when deciding what you need and why..carlnamaste"
1,YOU NEED TO READ SANSKRIT,This dictionary is for those who read actual sanskrit. I needed a transliteration and this does not have that.I hope I can return it as it does not suit my needs. If you read sanskrit it will be a very simple and easy book to use.
3,not bad,"not as good as clarins or shiseido, but for a less expensive product, at least i didn't look like a pumpkin"
1,Why Take the Chance? This Pic DESERVES a 1001 Words!,"The product calls itself a ""grab bag"" and suggests that its value is a ""minimum"" of $19.99. Think again about this one, folks--there are NO free lunches in this world, and that goes for bargain bags, as well. I opened my LARGE box containing my ""goodies"" only to find a HUGE amount of stryofoam peanuts and a very small bag. Within this bag? A single root of hollyhock! That--and ample dirt, for weight, I assume. The value? I could have purchased that same root, alongside a pot and some actual foiliage, for less than what I spent in the extra postage. As I said earlier, ""think again."" $19.99 + S&H seems a bit steep for a single root--of hollyhock, no less."
5,Delicious PB,"I dont have much to say that hasnt already been said - but i know when i go on here to buy food product, i like to read the reviews, and see how many stars the products get and WHY.I have tried many natural PB's, and this is now my peanut butter. I am a vegetarian, so i like to have something like this for protein. I also cannot eat whole nuts. This peanut butter tastes GREAT.I do store it in the fridge, but i sit it out to get room temp before i make my sandwich or toast or whatever. It quickly comes together and becomes spreadable again.Love this peanut butter!!"
4,great book for a little entertainment during exam crampings,"This book is hilarious, 3 quarter at least. The last quarter of the book is not as funny. However, it's worth the money! If you want a good laugh, this is a great buy."
3,Great as a memoir but not great for humor...,"This was an interesting book. I was surprised by how creative she was and how good she became at living on $10 a week. I even learned a few tips. I also felt sorry for her and really wanted to help her. It made my problems seem much smaller by comparison. If it was a simple memoir, I would have given a higher rating. But I know this book's intent was to be funny, and her sense of humor is not the same as mine."
3,Maybe my sense of humore is off lately but...,"I just didn't find this book all that funny or clever. It was definitely amusing at times but also incredibly shallow and a bit wrong. I'd hate my college-bound daughter to resort to stealing textbooks and such. I certainly identified with some things. I lived on Kraft boxed mac n cheese for months on end, learned to make it without milk and butter (definite splurges) and I can't eat it to this day. Looking back at it, it was amusing but I wouldn't publish it and I'm not laughing out loud at someone else's similar experience. I had just read ""The Hours"" and wanted something light to bring me out of my resulting funk but this was lacking any depth to interest me."
5,Great!,"This book is the best stress relief. It's FUNNY! Constant and unabashed, the adventures or misadventures of Angela Nissel should be read by anyone who needs a good healthy dose of laughter. It's the best medicine."
5,Funny stuff that happens when you're too young to know better,"Wonderful light reading and absolutely hilarious. Angela was one of my first ""celebrity"" interviews I'd done in undergrad. After reading her book I had to talk to her. I was able to relate to a lot of stories she told, even though a few were just over the top. A few scrapes could have been avoided by being more prudent, but isn't that exactly what your early 20s are about anyway?"
4,Funny Book,This book was pretty hilarious. It was great to read about her adventures as a completely broke college student. I really liked this book!
5,hilarious,"This book definitely had me laughing out loud. When I was in college, I worked 2 or 3 jobs every year except the first. They totaled up to 40-60 hours a weeks-- at minimum wage that's not much cash. Some people say ""work more"" when you're broke, not realizing that every part of the country has different job opportunities...If you're not an okayplayer, or one of our generation, you might not enjoy this book. I noticed that some older people who I knew were broke thought there was either something wrong with laughing at it, or just didn't understand why parts of the book were funny to me... you have to live it to understand this."
4,What a diary,"Angela Nissel write through journal entries, how she got through all her broke days while in college, I could relate with most of the entries. The part about the bill collectors calling was so funny. You don't want to miss this funny diary."
5,Oh My-Lanta!!!! This is the funniest book I've ever read!!!!,After reading the excerpt online I was hooked and had to buy the book. I read it in record time and still find myself picking it up to re-read certain entries. Angela did an great job of portraying her 'broke-ness' to us all -- and what college student -- former or present -- could relate somewhat. This book is a must read for all!!
4,Funny READ. Painfully close to college life.,"this book made me lol on numerous occasions. The reality of it was strikingly common to my reality throughout college. this book is meant as a light ""on-the-side"" read. for it has no storyline...just day by day incidences that seem to happy way more often to ANG than to the adverage person. overall very easy, fast, and enjoyable read."
2,"A little funny, a little annoying","Hmmm... some of her stories were funny, but I was a little annoyed at her always complaining about being broke. As a college student who sometimes works 60 hour weeks while being an engineering major, I can't understand why she doesn't just work more?"
1,A Disappointment,"I was personally very disappointed with this book after all of the hype on the radio about it being the most hilarious book. I found this book boring and not very funny, and the same things were repeated over and over again. Such as glueing the bumper back on her car.Overall I give this book a 1 and would not recommend it to anyone."
2,i wanted scam ideas,"I picked up this book because I am a broke college student. I spent [money] on a book that promised good scam ideas and got zilch. All this book is, is the account of a girl who complains a whole lot and doesn't seem to get anywhere with it. I don't get it. She wrote like she was trying to be hip, but she failed. Maybe she is hip, but she doesn't sound like it. I was dissapointed. I could have bought food for a week with the money i spent on this book."
2,it's really not all that funny..,"I thought it was dreadfully boring towards the middle of the book actually and had a hard time finishing it..The end is better than the middle, but overall, it just wasn't that funny. I had just finished reading Dan Zevin's ""The Day I Turned Uncool"" which is absolutely hilarious, so I found this book really boring. Well, anyway, it's a light read.."
5,One of My Absolute All-Time Favorites,"It would take me much more than a measly 1,000 words to describe how much I love this book! For starters, I could totally relate to Ms. Nissel on many levels, especially since I too attended college in Philly. The author is funny without even trying to be; matter-of-fact statements about her life and her perspective make this book a quick, breezy and hilarious read.This book should be required reading for all college freshmen...and their parents."
5,Buy one for yourself and a few more as gifts,"This book is hold-your-stomach, wipe-your-eyes, try-not-to-disturb-the-neighbors funny and yet so honest - nothing is sugar-coated here. If you have been broke, or are broke, you may want to cry in recognition and sympathy but will find yourself laughing instead. If you think you don't have the great ability Ms. Nissel has to laugh at your misfortunes, by the time the book is finished you'll realize it isn't too late to start. What perfect justice that turning all this angst around is helping to turn the author's financial situation around. Also, it's about time everyone learns about the evil that is ChexSystems and the nefariousness of banks and parasitic check-cashing outlets as well. REVOLUTION!"
4,Hilariously Entertaining,"Have you ever truly been broke? Whether the answer is yes or no, this book will keep you laughing.This is a book full of adventures and misadventures of a broke college student. This book is nothing less than entertaining. You are so busy laughing at Angie and her adventures that you don't have time to sympathize with the fact that she's very short on funds. How can you laugh at the whole ""No Frills Mustard"" episode. And for those of us who like poetry, we can all laugh at her description of open mike night, especially ""Misinformed Militant"".This is a good book to read when you're in need of a pick me up. It made me re-evaluate what it means to be broke."
5,I am so grateful I found Solid Gold Seameal,I have 3 dogs and 1 cat and I add this to all of their food. I give my cat a little canned cat food and a couple pinches of this. The dogs I add the suggested amount. My one dog has airborne allergies and rubs his face all the time and scratches and this lessened his discomfort and itching. My other little guy has Cushing's Disease and his coat and skin still looks good. Every one of my pets have a beautiful coat.
4,Very Good Tasting Low Carb Cookies - Highly Recommended,"Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am always looking for sugar free, low carb snacks. These Sorbee Sugar-Free Cookies are really great tasting and have minimal impact on my blood sugar levels.I enjoy having one or two with my morning coffee, but never any more than that as too much Maltitol (one of the sweeteners) causes me extream ""gastric distress"". It would be a good idea to see how these affect you before eating a bunch of these yummy cookies in one sitting.Sorbee makes several different types of these cookies and the ones I tried are all pretty good.Recommended!"
3,so-so,"This flavor is just okay. They are crunchy, which is good, although MANY arrived broken to pieces. The peanut flavor lacks richness. For those of us who love cookies but have to avoid sugar and white flour, the pickings are very slim."
1,Not even worth complaining about.,"But I will complain anyway. If I would have liked the cookies I would have complained about only getting one bag when I ordered and paid for four. But since they were so bad, I would rather they remain in Sorbee's warehouse than clutter my trash bin."
2,Poor taste and texture,The cookies are hard and taste bland. Very disappointed that I bought a 6-pack and now have no idea what to do with them.
2,not at all happy,"The taste was tolerable, but I've had better sugar free cookies and the peanut butter taste was negligible. Also, every single cookie in the case--all 6 boxes--were crushed. There was not a whole cookie in the entire shipment."
4,Four and a half stars,"I really liked this book. I've read all Ms. Griffin's books, and this one was a nice change of venue. I liked the fact that Hatch wasn't well-to-do, but really had to struggle, like so many of us do. I've always liked the way this author leaves out all the senseless gushy-gush and didn't have Skye take one look at Hatch and fall in love with her. It was a love story, but a realistic one. Hatch's sister Chantal was real sassy and sometimes pushed limits, typical for teenagers. And I loved the ending."
4,One Night,"I went to a writers conference and met the author, Marsha Qualey, and when she talked about this book, it persauded me to buy it. When Kelly, a recovering heroin addict meets Prince Tomas, they spend a crazy day together. First its all for a story, for her aunt Kit, delivering a book to a recording artist who made her mad, but in the elevator she meets Prince Tomas, who is here for peace talks. They run from security guards and spend a night on the town. Where, Tomas tells Kelly about his sister, who is hurt from a mission trip, and forces Kelly to go in depth of her addiction. He brings up the pain and hurt she faced when family comes up. She almost killed her baby sister when she was on heroin because there was a fire and she was stoned and didn't know what was happening. What will happen when the morning comes?"
2,Not all that great,"I was required to buy this book for a class in college. My instructor worked up a hype for Mr. Meyers' A+ books. To my utter disappointment, this book did not teach me a thing. In fact, I sold this book early in the semester and finished the semester with a different book. If Mr. Meyers really is an A+ guru, then this book is weak to his standards. This book will not pass you on the A+ exam."
3,It's OK,"I have another Speedo suit that I like better - I purchased both of them at the same time to wear to swim laps and for water aerobics - I haven't worn this one yet because there is a snap in the back that doesn't seem like it would stay closed while moving around a lot- I don't want it to pop open while I'm exercising, so I'm hesistant to wear it, so it's hanging it my closet unworn."
2,"I hated, hated, hated this book","It starts out being a not a bad reference and some of the examples are adequate, if not particularly insightful, or dealt with in any great depth. The author belongs to the colorful detail school of fiction writing -- he tells you every chance he gets. Fine. But by the final third of the book, the author is into total self promotion, and it gets on ones nerves. Instead of ""How Fiction Works"" being the title, perhaps it should have been ""How Fiction has Worked Very, Very Well for Me."" The book appears to have been dashed out to meet a contract committment without any serious thought put into it. Mr. Hall may well be the marvelous writer he claims to be, but as an editor he should aspire to improvement. I bought this book on the basis of an Amazon programmed recommendation and the reviewer comments. Sad to say, the rule about letting the buyer beware still applies."
2,"Pretty bad, but not the worst...","This CD has a stale feel to it. There are some good tracks, notably Incendiary Lover and This Is Heresy. But I've heard better recordings of virtually all these songs elsewhere, and I don't understand why the CD had to sound like it did. Well, it doesn't matter, 'cause a year later the band releases Atrocities, which just blows this release away."
5,I can watch over and over and over and LAUGH each time,"I love these stand up routines. They are thought provoking, funny, serious, intelligent. I have watched them many times and have showed them to many friends. Ellen is a GREAT comedian and her material is original. With this set you are getting two of her stand up routines--well worth the money. And, if you ever feel down, just pop one in and laugh uncontrollably."
4,Magic twist,This rubiks twist is bigger than my sisters cobra. It is flexible which makes it easy to fidget with. This also makes it really easy to turn it and make it still work. I was waiting for it to come in the mail for so long and it finally came today. Overall I rate it four stars because most of this I rate five stars but I am not sure how much it is teaching me so I gave that three stars. Mine came in a package showing all the shapes you can make it into but I made it into other shapes that were not even on the box. Mine is multicolored. The triangles are about triple the six of a button on the iPad. I really like that it bends back and forward when you swing it but it does not break.It comes In white and blue but I like the multi colored better.
1,Broke Immediately,It broke as I was untwisting it from the ball shape in which it arrives. It was literally out of the package for less than a minute. Nothing like the quality of the original.
2,Cheaply made,"I had one of these as a child 30 years ago and loved it. It lasted for years, got lots of use, and never broke. I bought one for my kids for Christmas and I'm pretty sure it won't make it through the month. Still a great concept, fun little toy. But there's no way this thing is going to hold up. Disappointing."
4,"Some pieces are more ""loose"" than others","This is an easy and fun product from rubiks. This is an official Rubik's twist, but that doesn't mean that its quality is fantastic. Its not horrible, but it could be much better. Some pieces click sturdily into place, while others almost spin freely, causing some difficulty.The ""stickers"" on it are decent quality, have some jagged edges tho. My twist came in the multicolor option, and i do know that some buyers have gotten a blue/white pattern on theirs. Its random which you receive.OVERALL. If you want a rubiks twist and are adding to a collection, or just find that they are a lot of fun, go ahead and get this. Its not the BEST quality, but i don't think there is anything else on AMAZON that is much better.Despite the negative points above, its still fun. 4 out of 5!"
2,Big Deuce,"The twist is a great toy. It just doesn't last. After owning it for about sixteen hours, my 8 year old dropped it and the thing snapped in two. He was crushed. So we had him do choirs around the house to earn the cash for another twist. Number deuce lasted five days before coming apart while the boy was performing a tricky bird of paradise maneuver. The boy said the twist is ""a crappy made toy"". I couldn't of put it better myself, son."
3,Product priced right,I got this for my 11 year old daughter who asked for a Rubiks cube for Christmas. I thought this was a cool twist on the old cube. We are still trying to figure it out but this is where I found it for the best price.
5,Rubic cube,"I am giving this to my grandson for a present. I'm sure he will love it, he lplays with rubic cube all the time. This is a different design, but more challenging."
1,Win Moves Rubik's Twist,"THIS WAS NOT THE ITEM SENT AS PICTURED! THE OLD ""BAIT AND SWITCH"" ROUTINE! I WILL NEVER ORDER ANOTHER THING FROM BRYBELLY AGAIN!"
4,GREAT PUZZLE! SIMPLE BUT FUN!,"This puzzle is really fun, albeit easy. I can create the default shape, the one pictured above, easily without even looking at the puzzle. The puzzle doesn't look like it will hold up well though. I guess I'll find out."
5,a toybox winner over and again,You can never go wrong with this toy. It pops up all over our house and we all find things to do with it. It is self-contained and invites exploration. We also bought it for a young friend with autism and have been pleased about its engaging texture and simple playability.
3,Not as well made as ones from years ago,"I've been a fan of this toy design for decades, and thought I would enjoy a new one. I've got two from the '80s that were pretty well made, and hoped that the official version from ""rubik's"" would be at least as good, hopefully better. Wrong, unfortunately. This one has no heft to it, and feels hollow, unlike my old ones. Some of the joints don't lock in very well, and spin too freely.This version may be all that's available any more, sadly. I will continue the hunt for one that's better built."
5,Matthew Liked it,"Gave it to 7 year old Matthew and 11 year old Seiji... they made amazing shapes, clearly enjoyed it. More creative in many ways than the cube.Solid construction. I think any mechanically interested would like it."
3,decent toy but not much to do with it,This is a decent toy but your kids will get bored with it pretty quickly. It isn't a complex toy but given to a smaller childen and they likely will break it; while it is semi durable if you twist the blocks hard enough they will break.
2,"cheap plastic, bad quality",It was a disappointment. Part of a twist broke within first 10 minutes. I wish I could find the same toy with better quality.
1,cheap,"This was a Christmas gift and within the first 30 minutes of playing with the rubik's twist, 3 pieces came off. Now I have to send it back and pay $4.00 for shipping and it cost me about $9.00. I was dissapointed with this purchase."
2,Crappy Playability,"The playability on this PC version is terrible. The controls don't work like they should. Even with my P4 and enhanced sound, the soundtrack and voices lag and stammer. The puzzles are annoying and outdated. The layout of the route you follow is redundent. The game is tedious and slow. The plot and dialogue are corny. This is like a game from the 1990's that's been updated with 2000 graphics. I think you're better off with Quake 2 or Enclave."
1,Not Glad I Bought It!,This is the second game that I've purchased by Eidos and have yet again been disappointed. The navigational controls are extremely frustrating with just a keyboard and mouse. The game is basically unplayable in my opinion. Maybe it's better with a gamepad.
3,"Fun, but flawed","I remember playing this game when I was younger and wanted to relive the fun. Some of my opinion now may be based on comparing it to new games. That being said it still is a fun game with a great story and characters. The gameplay is fun and the puzzles are hard, but not impossible.One problem I have with the game is the wandering. With a map that huge you need a map of some kind which they don't have. Nothing is more frustrating wandering around a huge map trying to find the one location so you can continue on with the story. You have to either memorize where everything is, or look up where you go next. That coupled with the fact that to look around you have to pause what you're doing makes for a tough, keep the game going, feel.Other then a big map without a map to guide you this game is a lot of fun and worth playing through."
4,Still Loving Tom!,"I've been a fan since his ""2-4-6-8 Motorway"" days. Luckily for us, his talent just increased with age, his views tempered by wisdom and experience. His music/lyrics aren't a ""gay"" vs. ""straight"" issue. It's all a matter of heart-felt lyricism. Here, Robinson adds cool lounge-rock accents (muted trumpets here and there) that reflect his maturity rather than attempt a ""commercial"" sounding record. Critics who lament his current style would do better to stop and listen with BOTH ears, instead of with an ear on the music and an eye on his sexuality. Easily one of his finest modern albums."
2,"Too complex, difficult to follow!","To complex, not even Matlab oriented as indicated on the back of the book (except for graphics), it might be Ok for Instructors for they will be able to see the matlab files (I guess), but for professionals, get Porat book, it is Matlab oriented and not so confusing. I do not recommend this book for DSP practitioners as my self. The book is full of mathematical expressions without clear explanations plus the format used in the book is very unclear. Overall, a very poor book. Hope next edition will have Matlab files available for everyone and will use another format to clarify the mathematical contents of the book."
4,Handy & Portable,This key board has a great design! And the instant connectivity with my N95 8GB is a big plus. I am having a difficult time adapting to the very congested keyboard but am confident that with use I will adapt. Sure beats T9ing emails!
1,Not good,"I tried several other keyboards to match up with my Nokia N800 internet tablet but had bluetooth pairing problems. Nokia would not help with pairing non-Nokia products so I ordered the SU-8W keyboard. Unfortunately the layout of the keyboard was difficult to use. Further, the keyboard can't remain rigid when opened and must lay on a flat surface. This is unlike all the other keyboards I tried. Due to pairing problems with the other keyboards, I remain keyboard-less."
3,Depends what you are looking for,"This was the first Tony Bennett CD I have gotten, after seeing him perform on the Today Show’s 50th anniversary show. The CD is great for what I call party/background music. The last song was really the best and I think worth the CD alone. The rest of the songs thought are enjoyable, yet I would really try another CD of his or some of the other singers that are on his CD. Yet this CD has so many great stars and is nice to listen to yet would not be on the top of my list. It just depends what you are in the mood for.PLEASE NOTE: If Amazon.com gave me the option I would have ratted this CD a 3.5"
5,Good,"Any fan of Tony, Jazz or Love Music in particular will LOVE this cd. It has a collection of really great songs and very talented artists."
2,I don't play it,"I saw a PBS special with Tony Bennett and friends--short exerpts recording songs with well known artists. It was great, so I bought this SACD. I was disappointed. The production is lousy. Many of the songs have a low-level hum in the background. I double-checked that it wasn't my system by switching tracks and by playing Ray Charles SACD ""Genius Loves Company"". No problems there; the recordings are flawed. There are four songs I like, two buzz, two don't."
5,Superb!,"What a magnificent gem! Breath of brilliant fresh air!At age 75, this master just keeps getting better!It's great to hear the relaxed, but clear, tight professional blend of Tony and his band, with each one of these guest artists!And, it's great because kids are waking up to appreciate this kind of music from this! Even K.D. Lang, said, touring with Tony was one heck of an education for her!Spread the good music! I bought three of these on CD and gave them away as gifts for X-Mas!"
4,Quality all the way.,"Tony say's it best. ""Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to have made many records with some of the best musicians of our time. But nothing in my career has topped the experience of recording this album."" MHH"
3,Pretty Good when it works,I have dug Tony Bennett for Years but after a while in the 90's He did whatever&the last few Discs show that.aside from Ray Charles&few Other Folks this Album is Seriously Hit&Miss.His Voice still sounds Good but not everything works.soem songs are too Polished every duet works.unlike a Decade ago nothing really grabs you fully all the way.it has Great Moments but it isn't as strong as the early 90's stuff.still Tony Bennett is a solid Vocalist.
4,We'll Have To Settle For This,"It's hard not to like a Tony Bennett album. After all, the guy's in fine voice, he's working with top-notch musicians and his song selections are impecable. So why did I give this just 4 and not 5 stars. Well for starters he doesn't seem to be stretching the limitations of his talents. Yes I know he's a relaxed singer and that's part of his endurring charm. But, this outing seems far too predictable, too rehearsed and lacking in spontinaity.If Tony Bennett set out to make a real down and dirty blues album perhaps he could have enlisted the help of some of Chicago's best...guys like Otis Rush, Buddy Guy and Etta James. Now THAT would have been a real blues experience. Until then we'll have to settle for this white bread imitation."
3,Claber Faucet Y,"Although everything looks and works great in the beginning, if the Y is in the sun on a hot day, the pressure in the line increases and this blows one of the lines off the Y and water runs until the open faucet is seen and shut off. This situation can lead to high wated bills."
2,Not the best for this one,"When I saw the first Hills Have Eyes, I couldn't tear my eyes from it, and I had watched it many times. The Hills Have Eyes 2, I was disappointed. I had gotten distracted many times and just couldn't get into it. I was expecting something like the first one, to me it felt like it was a rip off just to get the money the first one ranked in. And the ending with the hand and the laptop, just thought it was stupid to an extent."
1,Not for me.,"It's been awhile sense I've seen the hills have eyes pt 1. I remember it being good. The hills have eyes pt2, not so much."
2,Not Good...,I saw the movie and it wasn't good as first one. the story was same as first one. This time military army fights the mutant people. I just don't understand why they put first scene was pregnant woman tortured. that was horrible. The military army was good to be fight them but some missing the part. First one was better not the second.
1,Hills Have Eyes 2 (Unrated),"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. I thought it was really boring, NO scares at all. I am deeply in love with the first one, I thought it was ""epic"" and I thought it was very gory and scary. A movie that horror movie watchers could love and enjoy. I bought Hills Have Eyes 2 (I've been wanting it for the longest time) for $3.19 and I watched and I almost carved out my eyes and gave them to the Hills. It was one the worst movies I've seen. Its an epic fail, and if you love the first, don't watch the sequel."
4,A VERY NICE SEQUAL!!!,"the first one was very good. i didn't really know what to expect for the second one. i was taken by suprise, it was up there with the first. there's a big difference in the plot, but the crazies are all the same. they thirst for blood, human flesh, and again they get it. i really liked this sequal, i thought they did a nice job, making your skin crawl, and sometimes look away. it's the hill peoples way of life they're mutants what do people expect. they have to do what they must to survive, to breed. i wasn't disappointed at all. if you're to squimish don't even bother."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"This movie does not live up to the standard set by the original films or even the most recent re-make. This film's throw-away characters do not hold your interest in any way. Even though there is some satisfaction in how each is killed off, there isn't anything here that other films of this genre do not do better.The recent remake did a nice job of creating suspense by showing that no character was safe. This film, however, gets away from that and one could probably predict the majority of the plot right off the bat.Do not spend your time on this one, as the writers apparently didn't spend much of their time on it."
1,A Let Down....,"Unfortunately the bad reviews this movie received from the critics are correct,it's a poor effort. It seems as though the makers of this movie just rushed the whole project through in a response to the success of the very good remake of the original film. Real bad acting starts things off (the sergeant was particularly bad!)and hardly improves throughout the duration. The story could and should of been so much better too. In short, a very poor horror movie, give it a miss."
1,JUST PLAIN TERRIBLE !,This sorry excuse of a movie honestly deserves 0 stars. When it comes to horror movies I am a huge fan and I certainly don't mind sitting back and watching a film that has little story and lots of gore and suspense. A group of attractive people who are killed off one by one. We've all seen it before and it can be fun escape viewing.But this movie doesn't even deliver this. They seem to be attempting a plot with the scientists at the very beginning and then the military involvement but the scenes at the beginning that are obviously meant for shock provide nothing as does everything that follows.I honestly recommend this movie to no one. It is pretty sad when a movie with such low expectations can still fail to deliver.
5,Hills with gore.............,Seen this movie in theatres when it came out. Not a bad movie. Its got great twisted gore scenes. The women are hot. Acting not bad. I don't know why some people give it one star. So get sick from from the Hills have Eyes 2.
4,"Maybe some people not like it, no harm to give it a try !","Same story of how people fight for their own lives in desperate situation. It is still a relief and comfort everytime watching a mutant is wasted by the National Guard trainees. It really cheers people up somehow, seeing some of these trainees eventually make it by their own will !"
1,Way to go Fox,just a suggestion why not release part one before its sequel thats pretty much a no brainer. besides this movie sucks the first one was great
2,Not bad,I thought this movie was going to suck. But it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. But the first The Hills Have Eyes is better. Of course the first movie is usually better!!!! You should give this movie a chance. Its not that bad!!!!
3,Good for the gore at least,"Though named The Hills Have Eyes 2, this sequel is not a remake of the original Hills Have Eyes 2 sequel from 1985, unlike the original Hills Have Eyes remake which was. Confused? Doesn't matter. This is just another entry into the torture porn genre. It won't win any awards, but it will deliver the grue in spades.A group of impossibly good-looking reservists are sent out to the secret Army desert site for training. Eventually they meet up with the local mutants up in the mountains and abandoned mines, which doesn't work out to well for the grunts, to put it mildly. That's pretty much the story, so it's just up to us to try to guess who will survive the ordeal and await the next gruesome dispatching. Definitely not up to the original remake, which was pretty damn good, but if you're in the mood for no-brainer graphic violence this will fit the bill nicely."
1,bad movie...,"The movie is not good at all, It'd be a better choice to buy the wes craven's original movies than this. It's an uninspired movie with bad acting, a dull scenario and sooooo boring."
5,Horror the Way it Should Be,"The first 'Hills' drew me to the second film. I was impressed with the presentation of the first. Not only did the writers take a different angle with this one, but suspense and plenty of surprises lie waiting in the hills. For those looking for a 'slasher,' don't look here. This is strictly horror, not a slasher, though slashing does take place.The characters have personalities, acting skills and are endeared to each other. No, the film isn't 'realistic,' but what horror film is. There's really no such thing as several hills with mutants set on murder. I was entertained by the excercise of my brain while in expectation of lots of horrible scenes. I was pleased with the film as a horror flick - plenty of blood, broken bodies and fright. The acting brought the film up high enough for a 5 in this genre. Worth the watch, but not for the kids."
3,Um this was GROSS!!!,"For all you people who said this wasn't gross enough or just average you're pretty sick!The 1st half hour alone was sickening... then to add the blood, guts, brains, body parts.. I mean CMON!!! I jumped a few times also..All in all it was more disgusting than the 1st one.. worse than Hostel, and Saw 3 combined..I guess I'm just disgusted by the whole inbreeding idea.. and felt sick when the guy attacked the woman.. Did we really need to see that???????Don't watch this if your the sensitive type...If you want to gag... then this is your ticket...It isn't a bad story line, the acting was good.. with the exception of 1 guy.. worth it if you like to be grossed out beyond belief"
4,I like it,"I like The movie, is funny and entertaining, is not the best movie of the year, but i enjoyed. :)"
1,Wished I hadn't seen it...,"A group of national guard soldiers are hunted down by murderous mutants in the hills of new Mexico.I thought this film was awful. From the opening scene: (Clearly a woman being tortured, giving birth and assaulted), to soldiers getting hacked to death weird scythes and weapons.This was not the film for me. I was disgusted by this film."
2,Eeww!,"If you like seeing a crotch being bludgeoned by a mallet, a finger probing the squishy brains exposed from a cracked skull, eyeballs being plopped out of their sockets, a man completely covered in faeces, a woman being raped, a blood-drenched birth of a mutant infant and the subsequent murder of the mother, limbs ripped apart, bodies mutilated... then this movie is for you!!!No script. No plot. No characterization. No semblance of any intelligent life - either from cast or crew! Perfect for anyone who owns a Bieber cd or a Snooki book *rolls eyes*"
2,What a hot mess of a movie....,"'The Hills Eyes II', one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time, is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest. Or worst, however you choose to look at it. While 2006's 'Hills' remake was one of the year's best, and truly frightening, horror films, this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment. Part 2 never gets off the ground, and neither does its mind numbing dialogue. Worst of all, it's not that scary."
2,UGLY MOVIE,"This is a matter of taste, but as much as I enjoy the occult, supernatural, and similar films, this one did not make the cut. The acting wasn't too good and I went to sleep. So should the eyes on those hills!"
2,Hills 2,I only watched this because my husband liked the 1st one and wanted to see the 2nd. I didn't like the 1st one at all. As this isn't as bad as the 1st one I didnt really care for this one either. Still has the raping of women in it to get more of theyre twisted ppl. Watch the 1st one if you havent already and you'll get a feel of what the 2nd ones all about. Rent first!!!
2,Not overwhelmed and it comes with a little surprise,"""I have had the Kwik Kik for several weeks now. I am not to impressed by it. My biggest complaint is that the ball keeps coming off the straps after about 30 kicks. The ball is fully inflated and strapped on as tight as possible. Lastly I was very surprised and disheartened to open my box and find an un-welcomed Mormon pamphlet with email address trying to solicate for your Religious Cult in the box."""
2,Maybe it would work better if the ball would stay on.,Maybe it would work better if the ball would stay on. After about 4 or 5 kicks it comes lose and you have to stop.
2,The philosophy of St. Augustine.,"St. Augustine's life was that of a writer on the relationship between God and his people. Much of the material he has written forms the backbone of the Christian religions. He is an important person in Western civilization. This book by Garry Wills is supposed to tell Augustine's biography. Instead Wills spends countless pages on philosophical arguments and one does not get a good view of this man nor the times he lived in.A previous reviewer commented that one should read the writings of St. Augustine himself, rather than try to fathom what he stood for in the Wills book. I agree with this assessment.I don't really care for Wills' politics and after this book not alot for his writing. This was a difficult book for me to get through. Even though it is short, the writing style has a lot to be desired. Perhaps Wills intended this book for his students at Northwestern. A real disappointing read!"
3,Vague,"With so much to say about Saint Augustine, it is difficult to include all of the facts in one book. It is impossible to include all of the facts in 144 pages. What makes this book disappointing is that this book has little to say about this magnificent man.At times, Wills focuses more on the writing of Saint Augustine than in his life. Obviously, there are not first hand interviews of this saint available. Instead, Willis interprets the writings on Saint Augustine. The product is so concise and scattered that it is often hard to makes sense of it. This is a tremendous injustice to Saint Augustine. The greatest shame is the fact that Wills focuses so much time on Saint Augustine's views on intercourse and celebacy rather than his defense of the Christian faith.There are so many better books to learn about Saint Augustine such as ""Confessions"" and ""City of God"". While the authors attempts to draw points from these books, the point are too scattered to interpret."
2,I learned very little from this book.,"If you are trying to learn more about this famous figure in history, I do not think this book will serve your purpose. While it does contain a few facts that are worth noting, for instance, the religious differences that prevailed long before the Reformation, very little stirred my interest or imagination in this account.I cannot recommend it as a source for truly understanding this major church and world figure."
3,Good bio details; thin theology,"Wills has produced a useful biographical sketch of the great St. Augustine. His treatment of the Donatists and their continuing battle with Augustine is very enlightening, as is his information about Adeodatus and Monnica (sic). The material on Augustine's theological thought tends to be, well, sketchy, and quite standard. A good, quick, lucid introduction to the great theologian."
1,Small book - small story,"As a non-Catholic I had heard St Augustine's name nevertheless on countless occasions, usually uttered with a suggestion of awe. I wanted to know more, but did not fancy a specialist's tome; yet I wished for more than an encyclopaedia entry. Unfortunately the book is not for the beginner, but supposes much prior knowledge. While the author's view that the saint was not a reprehensible debauchee who made good when his hormones had subsided with age seems somewhat unorthodox (and quite plausible) there is little to put the reader clearly in the historical or geographic or, even, political background. No index, poor bibliography, not a single map. Thus it seems too slight as an introduction to the life of the saint, and is, of course, not a definitive study. It did not inspire me to seek other studies of Augustine. If it could not inspire the author to write in a more inviting manner, perhaps the inspiring days of the saint are long past."
3,"Not the introduction I was looking for, but informative nonetheless","Writing a biography of such a complex man as St. Augustine in a book as short as this one is a tall order. While Garry Wills does a decent job on the whole, I felt many times that he was simply stuffing in as much information and deep theology as possible without making it readable. Some passages feel bogged down and out of place in what is meant to be a concise introductory biography. That being said, if the reader knows relatively little about St. Augustine going in, he or she will be able to gain a basic understanding of Augustinian principles by reading this book. Overall, I would not recommend it for someone who simply wants a basic introduction to the life and works of St. Augustine. It could really only be used effectively as a refresher for someone who is already familiar with the topic."
5,St Augustine for Everyman,Garry Wills is an excellent writer. Saint Augustine: A Life is insightful yet not pedantic. Wills captures the life of a giant of a man who had a significant impact on religious history. It provides good reading for anyone.
3,disappointing,"I know Mr. Wills is a scholar's scholar and would clobber me in a game of Jeopardy,but this book wasn't very good. I now find myself really wanting to read the Brown bio on Augustine - as those quotes used were points to look forward to in Wills' book. I don't know why Wills waited until the last 25 pages to write in a concise manner (the way Brown must) and truly explore what made Augustine's unique life so fascinating. I just wish the first 100 pages would have been as interesting. Instead they read like an intellectual 'mailing one in'.Heres betting this was a blip on the screen, and Mr. Wills next effort will live up to the justified high praise he has earned over the years."
5,Beauty Like the Night Delivers,This one is not your same old romance novel. It first struck me like what you would find on a PBS series. Well written and well paced. The characters are real. The visuals you see in your minds eye are wounderful and realistic. You can feel the tension between the characters. The sexuality is smoldering. The story is intense and keepts you turning from page to page. This ones a keeper.
4,A Second Chance At Love?,"Can two people who once loved as children be reunited as adults? Can they work together, forsaking their own desires, to help a child they both love? Can a little girl find the voice she has lost and reveal her secrets locked inside? These are the questions that will be answers as you enjoy Liz Carlyle's newest novel ""Beauty Like the Night."" Liz is an original author whose stories are magic. ""Beauty Like the Night"" will have you rapidly turning the pages in anticipation. Her characters, from an overly rigid moral earl to his lazy ginger cat, will keep you guessing. As these people's secrets are revealed, you will experience the magic of a love that has endured eleven years of separation. I recommend you order this novel, sit back, and enjoy."
5,Excellent Book,"I have to admit that this is the only Liz Carlyle book I have read.The reason I bought it was because I didn't see anything else that caught my interest at the store and it's cheap price.($3.99!!!)I just love all the characters. Especially,Camden's daughter.I will be sure to read more of Liz Carlyle's books in the future. I hope they are all as good as this one."
3,"""A little too slow",This book was a bit hard for me to get through. It's not that bad but just a little too slow. I enjoyed the characters. Liked the hero and heroine. It was just a little too long and drawn out.
2,I only got halfway through,"I am sure this book gets more interesting in the second half, but I didn't get that far. I got tired of these characters, and the lack of plot. It went like this: Governess arives. Employer recognizes her from a tryst they had as teenagers. They both regret their past. She wanders around in the garden. She visits a church. She plays backgammon with a brother. They remember the past. They worry about a child. They meet in the library. They talk, but not really. They are repressed and depressed. Nothing happens.Sorry, I can only take so much of this. I'm going to go read some Amanda Quick -- at least her books are entertaining. Or Joanna Lindsay -- at least her books are sexy. At this point, I frankly don't care if Cam and Helene make it to bed or not."
3,"Beautifully played, poorly recorded.","The music has been beautifully played but unfortunately the recording was not as well done as other labels, such as the Dutch Philips label for instance. However this cd has some of the best renditions of these pieces of music, making it a worth-while addition to a classical Edvard Grieg collection."
3,You'll see things differently...,"You'll see things differently after you read this book. There were parts of history that I thought I knew pretty well, but this book helped me see them in a new way. Of course, the more you can turn history, look at it one way and then another, the more robust it becomes.The book is divided in a way that allows you to read about specific times and people so you can skip to the parts that interest you most. But I do think that it's a good book to read in its entirety because it does shine a different light on history.It was really refreshing to read a book where the men were incidental characters for once!"
5,Humorous...,"A delightfully humorous read, Tell it to Naomi is about a plan involving an advice column turned awry.This book made me laugh and I really enjoyed reading about Dave (a very likeable and adorable protagonist)'s antics - and even his way of talking :)I have read Ehrenhaft (well, he has a pseudonym)'s other work (The Wessex Papers), and I think he has a very smart and clever way of writing. The humour is wry and very entertaining, and the plots are always intriguing.A good, light read. Recommended."
4,A pithy fun read...who says pithy?,"As you can see on this page, this book is about Dave who is 15 years old. Dave lives with his sister, mother, and aunt in an apartment in New York He gets wrangled into writing an advice colum pretending to be his sister Naomi. Of course...chaos ensues.The book was well written, and held my interest well. Dave was a pretty likeable character and it didn't get too angsty and turn me off, so that was good. It was funny, and had some seriousness but not too much.I would have liked a little more of a conclusion, some sort of wrap up, but that is the only real fault I have with this book. I would defnatly recommend it."
1,Trick or Treat - Must Miss This One,"I read mixed reviews on this product but decided to take a chance and order it for my girlfriend. Bad decision.I found the shoulder and neck stitching on this costume was loose and pulled out, the threads were almost dangling, either from poor sewing and workmanship or because the product was possibly stretched, ripped, or otherwise damaged by a previous customer and returned.As for sizing, it must have been made by Omar the Tentmaker because the Small/Medium fit is HUGE and baggy, my girlfriend is normally an size 11, 5'7"" and she was drowning in it."
1,Costume,The Costume was not in a good condition and it was smelling. For the same price I could have get a new and unused product.
1,Do Not Buy!!!,Not an apple product. Did not fit my airport. Not even close. DO NOT BUY!!! Looks like this guy Frankensteined a chord together and sold it. Just call Apple and save yourself the headache.
1,WRONG,"This is for the Apple AirPort Extreme's current model. If you have the Round AirPort Extreme Bridge/Access Point, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS."
2,Not an actual airport!,"When I first ordered this I thought that I was getting a great deal on an Apple Airport. But I was dismayed when I got the package and found that it was a power adapter. Once again, THIS IS A POWER ADAPTER, NOT AN ACTUAL AIRPORT EXTREME!!!!!!!!!!"
3,acceptable,I wasn't too thrilled with the book. Maybe it's just me but the way it's written made it hard for me to pay attention and understand what was going on.
1,Ward is NOT Native!,"Do not read this book. Ward Churchill is a wannabe Native. He is not Native American, he's not an enrolled member of the Cherokee, the tribe he claims to be from has denounced him and stated he is NOT an enrolled member and does not have Native American blood. Ward is also not a member of the American Indian Movement (AIM). AIM has denounced him as well and has mentioned his falsehood on their grand governing councel website, http://www.aimovement.org."
5,What A Gem!,"I was searching through the budget rack at my neighborhood record store when I came upon this CD of Tomsic's Scarlatti selling for $2.99. It's a steal at ten times the price. What strikes you in these performances, apart from the superb technique and immaculate articulation, is how intensely lyrical these renderings are. Many fine pianists have recorded these works, but with Tomsic you get this sense of inner repose that you don't hear with the others. Even in those sonatas requiring a lot of fingerwork (the opening D minor comes to mind) there's an incredible sense of spaciousness, the music never becoming tight and forced. In the more slowly paced sonatas, such as the F minor L.383, Tomsic always keeps a sense of line, she always holds your attention.It's unfortunate Tomsic hasn't had a bigger career in this country, because this is absolutely superb playing."
5,wonderful scarlatti!!!!,"this is really one of the most perfect interpretations of Scarlatti. Precise, but full of fire. refined nuances a very deep reading of the author, generally people tend do show only technic, once this sonatas are very, very, difficult to play. Not this one,and this is the great diference between this interpreter and others: there are soul in this sonatas"
3,Oh Come On....,"While I certainly agree this young woman is a gifted musician, she is only so in the technical sense. Her performance is devoid of emotion. No warmth, no passion, no humour. No risks are taken. Nothing is explored, save the notes on the page. This is fine acedemic playing for the conservatory recital hall, but nothing more."
5,Hats Off -- A Genius,"This recording of Scarlatti Keyboard Sonatas is among the finest ever recorded. Dubravka Tomsic has such a gift for shaping musical phrases, for keeping a steady beat, for allowing the music to come alive. Her left hand puts every great pianist to shame. She is truly one of the greatest musicians alive and working today. She is making art at the highest level possible. Not only should she be well known by serious musicians, she should be a household name in America!"
1,Too Loose,"I bought this pink silicone skin protector for my sidekick 3 and when I put it on, the middle top & bottom part of the rubber case is loose like the rubber case is too big for the sidekick 3 phone. Everything is fine, just that some parts are loose like it has been stretched out."
5,Beatty and Dixon strike gold again,"The writing team of Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon manage to strike the same kind of gold with Nightwing: Year One as they did with Batgirl: Year One and Robin: Year One before it. Showcasing the transition of Robin the Boy Wonder to the brooding Nightwing, Beatty and Dixon weave a tale that is surprisingly compelling and full of character development. Not to mention that there is plenty of action throughout this TPB as well, including a team up with the original Batgirl, and a confrontation with the Joker. The pencils by Scott McDaniel and inks by Joss Whedon's Fray inker Andy Owens are superb for the most part, even though they can look a bit cartoony from time to time. Virtually flawless and one of (if not the) best Nightwing stories ever, Nightwing: Year One is a welcome reminder of what a super hero comic should be. All in all, if you're a Bat-fan who enjoyed the previous Year One's, you'd do well to check this out."
1,Fans Weren't Thrilled for a Reason,"This book has been hyped as the ""best of the Heroes Reborn"" books, featuring artwork and ""plotting"" by Jim Lee. If so, I think I will skip the other Heroes Reborn books (all of which failed after an initial surge in sales). The artwork is not Jim Lee's best (sorely missing the inking of X-Men collaborator Art Thibert) and the writing is astonishingly bad.Marvel followed up on the concept of updating their classic characters with the highly successful (and fanboy approved) Ultimate universe a few years later. If you're looking for a fresh take on the FF, I would recommend checking outUltimate Fantastic Four, Vol. 1."
5,Heroes Reborn : Fantastic four is very good!,"The Heroes Reborn: Fantastic Four book is very good! Brandon Choi, Jim Lee, and Scott Williams who are the creative team on WildCats revamped Fantastic Four for Marvel comic's Heroes Reborn project! Jim Lee draws the first six issues and Brett booth and Ron Lim draw the last six issues. Jim Lee's art is breath taking! The way Jim Lee draws Fantastic Four & Avengers is wonderful! He draws Namor very well! The Marvel characters, Wyatt Wingfoot, Mole man, Super Skrull, Dr. Doom, Silver Surfer also play a part in Heroes Reborn. I recommend it if You like Jim lee art and Fantastic Four comics!A++"
2,It works .... Sometimes,Been using this for around 1 year now and it crashes allot and when it does it doesn't hang up the phone line. This could be for hours or days depending if your on vacation or just out and about. Haven't found any support anywhere yet. When it works it works pretty well. Mailboxes are easy to setup and the built in options are more then suffcient to use in a small office enviroment. Look around I'm sure there is something better.
1,Ray Gillen's legacy disgraced,It's truly sad to see Al Romano try to ca$h in on the tragic death of Ray Gillen. Please don't give this man your money.
5,Make sure you are familiar with Tensor Notation,The author has a good approach but a few more fully worked out examples would have been helpful. Make sure you are familiar with tensors as this is vital for understanding the technical aspects of this subject.
5,A fresh approach on the derivation of General Relativity,"I read the 1st edition at my local library and enjoyed it so much, I went out and bought the 2nd edition. It is easier to understand than similar books on the topic."
5,Gift for My Brother and He is Delighted,I cannot thank you enough that I was abe to find this on Amazon. I purchased this to help my brother complete his MASH collection. He was really surprised and is really enjoying his whole MASH Seasons now. I had no problems with the shipping or the condition of the tape. Just as describled by the seller. Thank you again.
5,Good stuff here.,"If this was a favorite TV show of yours, then the price is right. No extras, but whatever.My only complaint is that you have to start each episode individually, rather than let the entire disk play though. Bit of a drag as these individual shows are only about 25 minutes in length. Lot of remote control button pushing, or maybe I'm just being lazy.Nonetheless I'm happy for the season by season release, and will continue to purchase them until BJ sports facial hair and Hawkeye turns preachy and roll my eyes political (Start of 4th season, I think.)"
4,Good & Uncut.,"Ten hours of good writing, talented actors, & outrageous characters make this one of my two favorite sitcoms. The picture quality is good and the ability to nix the laugh track was a nice bonus. The MASH units were the unsung heroes. Without this show many of us may never have learned about them in school? The show blended emotional storylines into a fine comedy/drama. My favorite of the 24 episodes was ""Sometimes You Hear The Bullet."" A male bonding tear jerker if there ever was one. You have the wickedly funny Hawkeye & Trapper John, their incompetant nemisis Major Frank Burns, his paramour the uptight Major Houlihan, buffoonish Colonel Blake, dress wearing Klinger, kind father Malcahy & the efficient puppy like Radar rounded out an excellent ensemble. This was not their best season, but few shows have had such a good start."
2,VHS edition has extremely poor picture quality,"As delighted as I am to finally get the whole season one of MASH on video, I am very disappointed by the poor quality. The VHS tapes are recorded in EP mode, and somehow I could adjust my VCR's tracking only to either get a distorted picture and good sound, or acceptable picture quality and distorted sound.Also, the episodes are arranged in production order rather than broadcast order. This makes more sense as far as some of the story lines are concerned, but the VHS boxes list the episodes in broadcast order, and therefore are useless.MASH is a great series, and it was great to see these episodes again, but the viewing pleasure was spoilt a lot by the extremely poor quality of the VHS edition. If you own a DVD player that plays region 1 tapes (mine only plays region 2), go for the DVD edition, by all means."
3,The best is yet to come.....3.5 stars for season 1,"MASH really didn't hit its stride until year 3, but season 1 offers up substantial helpings of laughs. Best episodes in the inaugural season include 'Tuttle', 'Germ Warfare' and 'The Long John Flap'. For fun, count how many times Hawkeye uses the term ""Meatball surgery""."
4,"A great series, but no extras?","I'm not going to go into too many details about the series. If you're reading this, you probably already know who the characters are, what the show is about, etc.The first season (24 episodes) is packaged on three DVDs with eight episodes per disc. The episodes are presented in airdate order. The video quality is quite good for film material from the 70s -- far better than the All in the Family DVDs. The audio is good as well.As others have pointed out, this DVD set comes with no extras. The only modification that I make when watching this series is to turn off the laugh track. M*A*S*H was such a thought-provoking series that sometimes the canned laughter was a distraction; yet funny enough that I didn't need to be told when to laugh.For the material itself, I give it five stars (I'd even go higher). For the audio/video quality, four stars and for the lack of extras only one star. Overall, four stars. For this price, the lack of extras is acceptable."
5,Fox got it right!!,"This first season DVD set is wonderful - The greatest 'bonus feature' the creators of this DVD series has given us is the option to play the dialogue straight without the laugh soundtrack. According to Alan Alda, the cast and crew never liked the canned laughter but CBS insisted on it. The people involved with the show felt the audience did'nt need to be told what was funny or when to laugh. Now you can watch these pristine quality episodes as they were intended - Without the laugh track (but for those who prefer it, the laugh soundtrack is also an option).M * A * S * H Season 2 DVD is set to be released in May 2002. We're finally getting a DVD collection with the quality it deserves! THANKS!! (Let's hope more classic shows are on the way...)"
5,The Glory Years ...,The Wayne & McLean Years.Probably one of the finest comedy/dramas series ever made.I'm buying the first 4 years.Wayne Rogers & Mclean Stevenson left after the 3rd year.The 4th year with Henry Morgan & BJ Honeycutt was terrific as well.24 Episodes for $30. How can you beat that? The X-File Seasons Cost 5 times as much!Don't expect any extras on this. I hear it's limited to: viewing with a laugh track or without one.Grab it! Enjoy it!
5,A rare opportunity,"I've always wanted to see this show and finally the opportunity has come thanks to these wonderful DVDs. I have recently retired and am spending much of my time catching up on recent pop culture and I'm thrilled to come across this gem. The writing, acting, photography are all top-notch. One minute, you're laughing, the next you're reminded that these people are in the midst of a horrible situation. My favorite episode of this set is when they steal the commanding officer's desk (don't think that would go over well in the Army!).Kudos to all involved. I just wish the opportunity to see this great show wasn't limited to people with DVD players or those with the inclination to purchase these DVDs. Can't some brave network (broadcast or cable) realize what a find this show is and air it?"
3,MASH,"I love MASH and I can't wait to get the others. The item arrived on time, I would have preferred a better casing, the first DVD was taped to the casing and when I removed the tape I realized that the casing was broken, but as I said before I love MASH."
3,POOR SOUND,"The DVD video xfer is outstanding, but the sound. It is mono and I need to turn everything up to here the dialogue. Why can't they put the same sound effects that FX obviously had (stereo).Other than that it is outstanding, and well worth the time I am going to spend remastering the sound!Oh well, again!"
4,Growing up with M*A*S*H,"I found the episodes in season one most entertaing! I loved this show when I was growing up in the seventies. It has clean humor, morals and sweetness about the charaters which you don't find in today's mindless TV. Today when you turn on the TV you are slapped with nudity, vulger language, and mindless plots. I think people ,if asked, are tired of what is on today and would not mind stepping back in time to shows like M*A*SH where you could sit down as a family without worries of cursing and nudity and vulgitery. This is an awesome TV series. I love watching it! Most nights when there is nothing worth watching I will put in one of the many episodes of M*A*S*H and enjoy clean humor and feel good afterwords."
5,MASH Season 1,This DVD was used. But it was in excellent shape. I am a fan of MASH and i am Happy to have bought it used.
5,Amazing series!,M*A*S*H is my favorite Korean war TV series.Alan Alda does a SMASH job at keeping you laughing.Highly Recommend.
5,great product,Really fast shipping and the product is exactly as promised. Great quality. Would definitely go to this seller again.
5,M.A.S.H. 1st Season Video,Still as funny as they were when their origanlly aired! These episodes are a true delight to watch again and again!
5,Finally...,"I for one am very stoked about M*A*S*H coming to DVD. This without a doubt is my all time favorite show. I would have bought it on VHS, but a DVD version just makes it a sweeter deal. I've got my remote in hand waiting for my package to arrive in January."
5,I'm in HEAVEN!!!!,I nearly mauled the U.P.S. man coming up the driveway to get my DVD's! I am so happy they FINALLY put the first of the collection out!!This is the best! Now I don't have to wait for the shows to come on at certain times. Just pop it into my DVD player and away I go!! Can't wait for the next set to come out in the spring. Keep them coming!!! Thank you FOX and thank you Amazon for such great service!!!!!
4,Comment on the laugh track,"I have loved MASH since I first saw it when I was young. However, as I am British and watched it on the BBC, I always watched it without the laugh track. The BBC coming to the decision that it wasn't necessary and the audience would laugh without promting.As a result of this I now can not watch MASH on the Satellite channels as they show it with the laugh track. I find it very distracting and consequently less funny!I am glad the DVD gives the option of switching of the canned laughter."
5,"Excellent , Awesome & Outstanding","Not many extras, but for the price this can't be beat. All 24 1st season episodes uncut and with an OPTIONAL laugh-track. For the MASH fans out there this is truely a must."
5,THE START OF GREATNESS,"I WISH TV WAS STILL LIKE THIS!!!! GUYS AND GIRLS HAVING A GOOD TIME, DRINKN AND MAKING GOOD JOKES!!!!!""LETS GET SOME BREAKFEST."" ""YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MARTINI FIRST, YOU CANT EAT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH!"" JUST A SAMPLE OF THE BRILLIANCE. WHAT COULD BE BETTER MEDICINE, WAR, AND COMEDY!!!"
3,Unreal!,"This Is Mash, the show that almost everyone watched when It was on the air.I bought seasons 1to 3 and only put in season 1 and I was just blown away. I found it hard just trying to play the episodes.This Is another 1lb of BS Included.Why,why Is It so hard to click on play episodes and see them one after another? This Isan't a 2 to 3 hour movie,there about 25 minute segments so why can't you be able to hit play and just sit back and watch one after another play on? Sorry but these people have to be missing some seriouse brain matter.I never ever expected to see this on a show like this.I'm done and done buying any more of these.I'll just wait and record them on cd one after another like they should be recorded.Goofy people that's for sure.I only wished someone wrote about the way they play the episodes, I would have saved $100.00. Tht's about it for this one."
2,not happy about the price jump,Amazon had this series at 20 busck per season and I started buying them but jacked them up to 30 so I stoped
1,Returning it!!,It took a long time to receive this item and when I finally did the set contained 1 tape of Volume One and 2 tapes of Volume Two in 2 Volume One covers and 1 Volume Two cover. Got all of that! Plus the quality of the tapes is very poor even for used.Dennis McCarthy
4,Where it all begins...,This is the beginning of something great! Meet the M.A.S.H. 4077 and learn to love them all for years to come. Alan Alda makes this a comedic gem worth watching again and again.
1,overpriced and poor quality,the shield was way overpriced for the thin cheap plastic it was made out of. The handle that was on the back to be used to hold it broke on the first use. It was not handled roughly and it broke. It was too expensive to return and thus we just took the loss. If looking for a shield look elsewhere.
3,Gold Roman Shield,"You get what you pay for but this is not by no means a bad product for the price. This is best used as a product for a photo shoot and or maybe something for a wall but nothing more, unless you want to use it as a toy for a five year old."
2,Louden's Quest,"Vision Quest was kind of boring book because it was suppose to be about wrestling but it's not, it's more about the life of Louden and his personal problems he has and struggles with. I thought the movie was better than the book, because the book gets into more details when it's really not necessary. I personally thought the book was ok, but the movie was better than the book, I recommend the movie to other people who are into wrestling , because it shows how Louden searches for his personal strength and understanding."
2,Sigh,"The only reason I picked up this book and read some of it was because it was a class assignment. There is no way I would ever read it again. Personally, I thought it had no real point to it and the ending was a disaster. No wonder it didnt come out in Sports Illustrated top 100 Sports books. I never thought a book could be bad, I guess I was wrong."
4,Security Issues,"The book is very readable and useful. My criticism is the treatment of SQL security issues. The audience that this book is aimed at is knowledgeable but not superhero. Chapters are titled things like ""Introduction to . . . "" and ""Your first . . ."" People reading books like this one about SQLServer are guaranteed to have problems with SQL security issues. A straight-forward section addressing getting us out of these problems is sorely missing."
3,Not the best computer book I've Read,"I have read many computer books, and would say that this one covers alot of ground in a relatively small book. I had the feeling that more than one person wrote this book, and they just slapped one author's name on it. Around chapter 11 in the book the tone of the author changes and the explanations for certain things seem to be less thorough, not to mention that there are major errors in the exercises in chapter 11. The last half of the book just seemed to get sloppy. The other thing that becomes appearant is that the book covers old technology, the author goes on and on about VB.net and how there is no Visual Interdev in Visual Studio .NET. My advice -If you MUST learn Visual Interdev 6.0 AND will be housing your data in MS SQL Server 2000 strongly consider this book. -If you have a choice of development envoronment look for another one as this one is outdated, which the author continued to make clear throughout the book."
3,Graphics stink and so do the controls,"Don't waste your money. Buy this used. I was so fed up with the crappy controls on this game, I just stopped playing it and went back to GTA4 and COD4."
1,poor game,for the price is good but Isn't a good game for have a nice experience in the PS3! not recomended...
5,"A beautiful, powerful novel","A deceptively simple novel, this is a profound work of art, an exploration of love and courage and hope; it tells of a farm family in Montana in the 1920's; tells of the connection of people to the land, in all its beauty and richness and harshness; tells of being connected to other people on the deepest levels. I cannot praise this book highly enough: it has depth but is a joy to read. Published first in 1938, it is a real find."
2,The Sun definately Set on this Warrior.,"As a huge fan of the original 3 Sunset Warrior books, I was excited about the possibility of yet another great installment in the series. I was sadly disappointed. In reading the back of the book you get the sense that this is indeed a book about the Dai-san, The Sunset Warrior. Really this is a book about Moichi, his bond brother with just enough of a sprinkling of the Dai-san to justify putting his name on it. While Moichi is a good character in his own right, the book doesn't live up the great standards that Lustbader set in his first three. The plot is convoluted and almost directionless. The uniqueness of his first books is lost here in a meandering tale that rockets along in an attempt to outrun it's own lackluster storyline. I found myself putting the book down in favor of others, and even had difficulty seeing it through to the end. Stick with the ""original"" Suset Warrior trilogy; they will always live up to their name."
2,Defective,"sme one as I had before,but quality went downhill. Pushbutton did not work.Battery leaked inside,broken chime brass tube buttons. Must have been old.."
1,I went through 2 in 4 months,Hung doorbell outside. Put chime above the door inside. Only worked intermittendly. Returned and recieved another one. Didn't work. Product is garbage.
5,Fine door bell,I bought this door bell to replace an identical model that failed after 10 years. The new one mounts easily and works great. Fast shipping and good communications from seller. Highly recommended.
4,Good Taste!!,Taste great and is easy to prepare.The size matters and it maybe used continuously for a regular traing person!
4,Best protein on the market...,"I'm by no means a protein expert but this in my opinion is the best protein blend out there. I've tried EAS, Gold Standard, GNC, and a few others over the years but I always come back to Pro Complex. This price can't be beat and the results may vary obviously depending on you're level of dedication. Protein is essential for anyone serious about workoing out regardless of the goal. This protein comes highly recommended always arrives well berfore the guranteed delivery date and always in fresh new condition..."
5,Incredible!,"Very good complex, best I have ever tried.I'm having it for a week only and the results are incredible!Powerfull increase on my strengh and stamina during training.Go for it no way to regret!"
5,Better than expected!,"Fills me up pretty good. Keeps me full longer than Gold Standard Whey. Great chocolate taste. More bang for the buck compared to the Gold Standard. I don't think I will buy Gold Standard anymore. I am more of a normal weight lifter, not someone interested in competing."
5,"more protein, less sugar!","Best value and quality of any protein I've tried in quite a while. First off, no bloated feeling like with other brand, way easy to digest. Second, love the balance of Bcaa's' carbs, etc! Most importantly, I can take it at night with out worrying about sleepless nights. I highly recommend this for hard gainers"
5,heres What I see in it:,Pro Complex Protein gives you:*60 gr of protein*14 gr BCAA's*15 minerals and vitamins*10 gr of glutamine
5,Best I've tried yet,"I used to drink Myoplex RTD shakes until they changed their protien formula (ended up being SUPER thick, like trying to drink pudding!), so I went looking for an alternative meal replacement protien shake. After some reasearch, reading reviews/forums, I decided to give Optimum Pro Complex a try... and was really suprised at how much better it tasted, how easier it mixed with water, and how much more protien it had, and a healthier blend of whey/egg protien too! Definitely happy with the switch :)"
5,Everything you need,"This has everything you need in a post workout protein shake. I usually put two scoop in a shaker and take it with me to the gym. Right after my workout, I mix with water and chug. It mixes very well and tastes pretty good. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a no hassles protein to use with a shaker."
4,This protein lasts forever..,"I love this brand and this size I get my moneys worth. Its 60g a scoop so for a female I just take one.. sometimes a scoop and a half is I had an intense day at the gym. It has about half or more of your daily vitamins so thats a huge plus if you forget to take yours one morning you can sub it with a shake. It also has bcaa and amino acids. The only down side of this is it has sucralose aka splenda, the people that invented splenda don't even use it.. I wanna try the natural pro coplex next ans will compare."
4,Great Product,"This product has way more BCAA than the standard gold whey, even thought they are both great products, if you weigh more u need to intake more protein this is why I choose this over the gold standard, and the fact it has more imperative BCAA's. I will be trying the recover 2:1:1 next."
3,Tastes bad,"The numbers on the nutrition label and ingredients list look good. The price isn't all that great. Taste isn't the #1 thing to care about when it comes to protein, but in the case of Pro Complex Creamy Vanilla, it tastes pretty bad. With out brands I'd really look forward to that post workout shake, now, until I finish this tub, I'll be dreading it."
3,Who says this taste GREAT?,"I just got some and I have had a lot better, Maybe I need to try a few more times and maybe Muscle Milk has spoiled me, but I think it could be a lot better, Looks like the make-up is great and has a good break down of ingredients, Just make sure you don't expect a milk shake."
2,"Strawberry is terrible, stick with Chocolate!!!!","I ordered the strawberry to have a second flavor because the chocolate was so good...what a misstake!!! Now I am going to end up throwing out half a tub of strawberry and reordering the chocolate!!! I have tried mixing it with a banana and even mixing the chocolate with it....there is no helping the strawberry out!!! STICK WITH CHOCOLATE for Pro Complex, Casein, and Whey...."
1,Best protean out in the supp business,"Good but taste gets old, id say always stick with chocolate.. Orabey if u mix the vanilla with penut butter"
3,problend is better,"im a fan of ON products, and this one is decent, but problend is better. it doesnt taste as good as problend, and doesnt mix very well either. try procomplex, then give problend 55 by wellements a try, you will come to the same conclusion."
3,Just don't drop it,"So my husband got this, because his trainer told him it would be beneficial. So, he brings it home, picks it up by the lid and spills it all over my carpet. We looked at the lid, and the lip is such a cheap plastic, it bent in on itself. The powder is SO SO sticky, do not use a vacuum if you have to clean it up. I now have to take my vacuum in to be cleaned because it has stuck to the inside of the tubes. My husband says the stuff tastes good, but as a consumer, please fix the lid!!! That's ridiculous!! Even after a deep steam clean, my carpet is sticky. Not good!!!"
5,My Favorite Chocolate,"I've tried a lot of different proteins and blends - Jay Robb, Syntha-6, Muscle Milk, Muscle Tech. The list could go on and on. I never really enjoyed chocolate flavor because they always seemed overtly artificial tasting. I would purchase vanilla and add cocoa powder if the mood struck me. That is until now. I was hesitant because I haveOptimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate 2 Poundand although it isn't bad, the taste is just okay in my book. TheOptimum Nutrition Pro Complex, Rich Milk Chocolate, 4.6 Poundis far better tasting in my book. Compared to other chocolate protein powders, it's pretty close to Nestle's Quick in taste. If carbohydrates are a concern for you, make sure you purchase the Pro Complex and NOT theOptimum Nutrition Pro Complex Gainer, Double Chocolate, 10.16 Pound. I'll continue to purchase this product and try the other flavors."
3,The best to who,"This product isnt as good as the title says, i think it'll be better to buy the chris rock seasons, the runtime of the shows is limited, doesnt have much extras and menus, so i suggest to buy the chris rock seasons, or the stand up shows, those are better"
5,So many laughs in just one book.,I love books like this. Books of true funny experiences all put together. This book contains one of the funniest stories of all time . I laugh every time I think of it. I recently reread this book after several years and found it as funny as ever.Now I want to read the first Dates from hell.
4,A Good Sequel,"Whereas this book is not as good as the original, thee are still many hillarious moments. Organized into some amusing chapters, this book can easily get one to relate to some of the pains of dating. Some of the stories where the Date From Hell is the person writing it, are a bit less amusing than the others. None the less, sometimes you need to laugh at yourself. Overall, you really can not go wrong."
3,"Not as bad as I thought, but not great.","Reading all the other reviews online, I expected it to be far worse than what it actually was. It was a bit drawn out and pretty corny. You can't take this movie seriously. I found the main character's voiceover through the movie to be the most annoying part. I bought this movie purely because Kat Von D is in it, and after watching it, it's unfortunate that she's not in the movie for more than 30 minutes, since she was the best part. Wish she would've had more dialogue too. It's a good thing she's a tattoo artist, because acting isn't for her, but it probably would've made the movie a lot more interesting if she had a bigger role, for me at least! This is one of those movies that isn't so bad.... if you watch it with friends, snacks, drinks, and are able to laugh at the cheesiness."
2,What?,"I won't go into this film as the previous reviewers pretty much hit the nail on the coffin (bad pun) with this very stupid/bad film, one thing i'm curious about, about 35 minutes or so into the film, what the hell was the point of The guy running around for like a minute or 2 with intercut slow motion images of him running? Was it meant to be a ""Finding himself"" montage? If so, why would they just make him run around? What? Couldn't the filmmakers think of a better montage than that? Probably not it seems. ""Cutting up Bodies with a meatcleaver was foul as f**k, but this guys face was even worse"" stupid filind of entertaining ok for a watch if you're bored or if you like so-stupid-they're entertaining films."
3,Light Work Shoe,"Casual looking, fairly lightweight steel toe shoe. Many of the places I've worked over the years required steel toe shoes though I could only find fairly heavy out of place looking boots. Once I discovered a number of companies offering steel toe sneakers I haven't looked back.This shoe has fairly good traction though If I had to pick again I would get a different brand as this shoe just doesnt hold snugly as my others have. It is sized correctly and I've given it three weeks to break in.Update:Three other employees where I work also had this same shoe and one other had the same issue I did. Within weeks of light use the soles started separating from both shoes. I couldn't even make it through a whole year with these. While light, these are easily the worst steel toes I've ever had. Most other brands I've had last easily 2-4 years and by then its something else wrong with the shoe, not the whole bottom part falling off. I don't think I'll be going with converse again"
2,Slippery and no arch support,"English is not my native language, but here I go. I've been using these shoes for only 1 week, and so far they are just OK.The ""toe box"" is rubbing against my toe, so at the end of the day it can be annoying. Also, they are very slippery on wet floor. I almost fell off my feet this morning, and in the city I live on is very common every day rain. Also there is almost none arch support, so I'm buying some insoles to wear with the shoes.I'm going to try them for another 2 or 3 weeks. If they don't get better, I'll get rid of them."
4,Works great,"This style of double hook is more widely spaced than others. That means you'll never have difficulty hanging a hammer with a fat handle. I rated it four stars because this design doesn't provide a means to ""lock"" the bottom of the unit into the pegboard."
5,Fun toy !!!,My puppy loves playing with this with my husband. We had a similar puppet that was used up and were so glad to find this one!
5,Great Insights,"Attachment theory provides valuable insights on why we react the way we do - and why our spouses react the way they do. Understanding why is a basic first step in restoring harmony and security in a marriage. Putting into practice what we learn is an entirely different matter. The suggestions provided are very practical but are increasingly difficult as marriage partners have retreated from one another. If your marriage is on the rocks you probably won't be able to fix it on your own, no matter how good the advice."
5,Marriage enhancment! =),This is a great book to read together...no blame games played here. Just improvements to be enjoyed by all!
5,Outlanders on the Moon,"Kane and his fellow outcasts have found a secret base on the moon(again). I really liked this book, it is a breath of fresh air compared to the rather lack-luster performances of the recent deathlands books. The whole concept while it has been done before is still orginal in many respects. If you like good plup and a good story, go ahead and read this."
4,Devil in the Moon,"The story line kept up with the better of the Outlanders series. The action is fairly fast passed but the characterization falled to flow on from the previous issue ""Prodigal Chalice"". The Domi - Grant - Lakesh interactions have taken a big step change. Although the storyline for this new mini series was strong, I felt the author dedicated too much ink to recovering background information and history for other issues. I guess all these ghost writers use the cut and paste function alot."
2,Not worth it.,"The art was ok but there was not enough sex or ""graphic"" to this graphic novel. Just not hardcore enough."
2,this movie sucks,"One of the worst movies I have seen in recent times. I kept on wondering whether this was a movie done at the beginning of Cuba Gooding's carreer because it has this 80s feel and looks so cheap and the acting and script are so bad. But it turns out to be a badly done B or C movie Matrix like movie. I would recommend this movie just to check out Val Kilmer's hair and glasses: who thought of that, it is just absolutely hilarious. But seriously though: this movie is not worth your time and money."
2,You must be a Sci-Fi guru to give this above 1 or 2 stars,"I think some of the middle scholars' and Sci-Fi fans might like this video. While I am a super fan of Cuba Gooding Jr and Val Kilmer, and for what they had to work with they did a GREAT job. Unfortunately, I am not a Sci-Fi Buff so you can dismiss my review if you wish. The story did lack depth, continuity and was slow paced with short spurts with some action. However, it just fell short. Sorry, I really wanted to praise Gooding and Kilmer"
1,Don't waste your time on this sad excuse for a movie,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen recently...The plot is predictable, the production lame and 2 normally good actors come across as though they just want to hurry and finish filming so they can try to do someone constructive with their careers.Their characters were so un-dimensional, it felt as though they were reading lines off a teleprompter.I can't help but think that Val Kilmer agreed to such pitiful costuming in an attempt to hide behind that hideous wig. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE COVER-I don't know what photos they pirated to put a handsome Kilmer on the jacket-but if you look on the back, you will see how he actually appears in the movie. I wonder if Val and Cuba sued their agents for letting them get cast in such a mediocre film or if they owed somebody a favor and this was payback. Either way-I rarely get rid of a movie, even if I only paid $4 for it, but this one is going to Goodwill."
1,This game was a let down,"Alright, I will admit it, I am a MGS junkie. I thought that this game was going to be the best. So I asked for it for Christmas. Well, I got it, played it, and sold it. It was a complete waste of time and my life. There is no story line and no graphics to speak of. Most of the missions are in the VR territory and there is no replay value you to it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
4,Almost as good as Metal Gear Solid (psx),"First of all, 300 missions sounds like alot, but after playing it for a while you realize that you have completed more than you thought. You are training in a VR world with Solid Snake, and other characters, like Meryl, and the Ninja. Although the Ninja only has 3 missions they are pretty fun. You can use alot of different weapons in different areas. But the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the first one has a really in depth story and this one is just training. I recommend that you play the first one to really have fun with this one."
4,MGS Ratings depends on below,It is fun most of the time some of it is a drag haveing to unlock every thing but if you have the guide then the rating is 5*'s. It is great if you like MGS it is a 4 but if you don't like every thing about mgs it's a 3.
3,"Please, read this, for your sake...","This message is important: If you didn't like ""Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions"" because it lacked a story, do me a favor, and shut up. Why? Because this game wasn't meant to have a story! It's an add-on to ""Metal Gear Solid!"" Okay, now, I think this game is really worthy of rental because it does tend to get boring after a few hours of playing. The music in this game is better than the VR Mission training in ""Metal Gear Solid."" The puzzles are a little frustrating (maybe 20%), but not complicated. The Weapons Training is fun, and the Stealth Missions, too. The graphics are the same as ""Metal Gear Solid."" I have mixed opinions about this game, but I would recommend renting it, buying it is up to you. The Ninja missions are a little fun, but there aren't too many. But as I said, it's up to you to decide if you want to add this game to your collection or not. I hope you enjoy it."
3,"Not worth the buy, rent it twice","This game has all of the great weapons and game control of its predecessor (Metal Gear Solid), but it's only VR mission after VR mission. Quick, shoot at targets, now soldiers, and back again. The few variations they include are short lived and not worth spending full price. My recommendation is rent it twice from your five day rental video store and be happy you beat it in 10 days."
3,Hmm. Interesting,"The only thing that will put you down is that you have to re-play all the VR training levels from Metal Gear Solid. After that, it's all level ground. So many different levels and types of training. MGS:VRM's replay value is very poor, because you've done all of this. What get's even worse is that (since it is training) if ANYONE OR ANYTHING spots you, you have to do that level ALL OVER AGAIN. That's get's annoying because in MGS you just have to outrun or kill guards if you're spotted. I agree that this should have been a pre-release. But it didn't. So put your army boots on and blast off into VR MGS training."
3,A Solid Expansion,"While there's very little storyline to speak of, VR Missions provides a plethora of challenging objectives that test strategic skills, quick thinking, and patience. The controls are solid, the missions are varied, and the sense of accomplishment is certainly there. Graphics and sound are minimalist and serve the game well. Sure it feels like a small expansion and not a full game, but it's worth a look if you enjoyed the training missions from MGS. I found the ""confidential"" image displayed after achieving 100 % completion to be a nice treat, and surprising as well."
2,The real MGS is better,"I'm a MGS fan and really like MGS. But this game is just a VR training for extra fun. It was kind of fun at first, but then I got bored of it b/c it's... just some training simulation missions all in a green hologram place, not a real mission. But for those who want to play ninja and do the special bonuses then this game gots it.I think most MGS fans will like this, but maybe a few won't. If you're extremely or really into MGS games, then this will be a good addition. If you don't like it that much, it's not a priority to purchase. It may be smarter to rent the game first rather than buy it."
3,A virtual treat for MGS fans...,"Those of you who couldn't get enough of Metal Gear Solid are likely to get a kick out of VR Missions, which offers different alternative missions to practice your skills and even gives you the opportunity to play as...Cyber Ninja! Ho-ha! Although those folks who never got into the original MGS are likely to pass it up, it's a pretty good game to play for awhile just to master all 300 missions."
3,If you want more stealth then this is a must!,"A good game for any Metal Gear fan which brings you over 300 missions to accomplish.But there are some points to consider;don't expect a wide variety of 3D environments because it is just always the same VR world on each mission.Plus you won't be fighting any big bosses or watching cinematic video sequences.Two stars have been taken away from its score because of this.It is just straight forward level-based game playing with many missions to fight through including Mystery Mode,several levels using different weapons but it can sometimes be rather repetitive.I recommend you try this game before you think of buying it.But I think you will be very pleased to know that you can finally play as Ninja."
3,ok but not great,"i think metal gear solid was THEE greatest video game ever and so i had to have this addition. i was a little disappointed. some of the msssions are a little drab. the really good ones, where you play the ninja, do not happen till late in the game and so the fun is short lived. some of the missions are so basic that i blew through them in no time and others so boring that i could finish them in my sleep. this was not awful but not great and that leaves you with three stars"
4,Very good!,"Its a great game, and whoever came up with the idea to make the training mode its own in-depth game deserves a gold medal! Great box, game and manual! Thank you"
2,Strange subject,The ideas expressed in this book are debatable I suppose. The writer's anticipation about 1882 is obviously a joke. His view on the origin of the great pyramid is totally unproven. For some strange and unknown reason I'm rather interested in the subject of the lost tribes. This book provides a 19th century viewpoint on the subject. However I've read better material on the subject on the internet.
2,Pretentious even by Goth standards.,"After hearing this I realize that the people that claim to be into this band just like them for their name. This ""music"" (mostly bad poetry, discordant noises and sound effects) is unlistenable."
5,The only downside is that it isn't long enough!,"Surprisingly enough, I didn't buy Hanging with the Sloth for a child. I bought this film, half jokingly, for my girlfriend, who completely obsesses over sloths. We watched it together and afterwards felt like experts on the sloth. It is easily the most entertaining animal documentary out there, and it won't be something we put on the shelf and never watch again. Sloths are so adorable and I was very relieved that there is a rescue center for them in the southern North/South American islands."
2,A poorly organized reference book,"This book simply can not be read cover to cover. If you are looking for a beginners guide to SUSE, don't get this book.If you are looking for a reference book with a lot of good technical information in it, this book isn't for you either. It has a useless index, and the content is scattered crazily throughout.I recommend instead Beginning SUSE Linux, From Novice to Professional. This book is written for Suse 9.1, but is great for a beginner. I have been using Suse for 9 months, and still got a great deal of helpful information from this one.Good luck, and don't give up on Linux, it is great!"
3,Good book,"This is a book it is good, this is a good book, a good book this is, if you need it you should buy it cause this is a good book."
1,Great Chapter Titiles & Section Headings. Ignorant editing,"This book has all the right Chapters and sections.It's a pretty good refresher -- especially if you don't mind reading poor explanations and worse code recommendations.I'm not sure what to find most remarkable: a) that editors were involved in this project (and they put their names on it); b) this is the 2nd edition; or c) no one appears to have written a significantly better all-inclusive text.If you know of a better all-inclusive reference, please post it here."
1,Suse 10.0 bible,"I feel as though i have wasted money and time with this book, i installed suse 3mths ago for the first time, and did so without the book which i bought 2 months into suse use. As a genuine beginner with an iq of 144 i have found this book of no help and i payed 26 pounds for it from PC world, i have now had to order 2 other suse books in an attempt to solve the few probs i have with suse like samba printer share, some media wont stream (only some) and why firefox has flash but not konquer? also help with installing nvidia drivers newer than the ones available through yast. The dvd is virtually identicle to oss and you still have to compile decss to play videos. All in all very disapointing and i was thrilled coming home with it.Nick"
3,Not as depicted,"The picture shown on the product page (www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009J4DG4/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00)depicts it with trim. I had ordered five units and none had trim included. I gave it 3 stars because it is a good unit overall for the price, but I was disappointed I did not receive was is depicted on the order form."
4,Good game for the price,"When i first got this game, I honestly wanted a game under 25 dollars. The graphics are good, and the features are great. As well as all 28 teams, you get World tournament mode, which is a tournament you can play with several countries. I admit that it is quite tough to beat the computer, ESPECIALLY if you put the computer level on all-star. Overall this product was definitely worth the money."
3,"Good Service, but","I get good reception with Verizon in most areas of the U.S.; however, I was more than a bit put off when I saw all the add-ons tacked onto my bills. Also, the early cancellation fee is exhorbitant, though I've read that it's been substantially reduced for new customers as a result of a court decision."
1,Verizon terrible customer service!!,"With 1 month to go I lost my phone Verizon made me pay for an early termination 200.00 when all I would have to do is pay 39.99 for the last month of my contract. Watch out Verizon has terrible customer, service I was lied to and thgen billed."
2,Was okay most of the time...,"Like another reviewer, I was close to the end of my contract. I had to pay a $200 early termination fee, and they kept acting like there was NOTHING able to be done.Verizon is very sneaky and do not explain much of anything. Once I had terminated my contract, they never sent a single letter or sent me any emails. I had to move locations, even after 3 months of waiting, no new letter about how much I had to pay. Verizon took it upon themselves to send my account to a collection company, BEFORE EVER SENDING ME ANY WARNING OR CHANCE TO PAY!Stay away from Verizon if you can...avoid the headaches."
5,This is not the latest edition,"Although the 8th edition is a great book, it was published in 1998. The most recent edition available at this time (10/2003) is the 9th edition published in 2000. It's ASIN number is 0960776281. That is about the only way to get to it since Amazon.com refuses to put up the 9th edition first on the page although I have asked them to many times. You can buy ""used-like new"" that are actually new, unread copies that have come back from bookstores as returns, or had slightly dented covers are were never sent out. Thanks a lot, Barbara Hudgins"
4,for a digital lifestyle,"As the book says, using a PowerBook is a digital lifestyle statement to some of its fans. That might sound a trifle pretentious, if you don't have one of these gadgets. But Story describes bunches of cool ways to use it. These are in the key chapters 3 and 4.He quickly describes the basics of using iPhoto to amass a collection of digital photos. And of using iMovies to view digital video. The chapters are somewhat short. There is enough detail to use the most common operations of these programs, and others. But the narrative only hints at the complexity of the full features of each program. The book provides a useful and quick survey."
1,Paid for new got used.... wtf?,"I was tremendously disappointed to see I was sent a used copy of ""PowerBook Fan Book: Love at First Boot"" not a new one as I paid for. Too bad, it was going to be a gift for my daughter, but not this old used book that I was sent without my consent to change my order. This will be my final order from Amazon.com"
4,"once you go mac, you never go back","Theres alot of usefull info packed into this small book, focusing primarily on what ordinary users need to know,it helped me bond with my powerbook."
3,Why?,"I am not understanding the rave reviews of this book. It's VERY expensive, barely 100 pages, and it gives a very cursory overview mostly of mac OS X, not really rhe powerbook in particular. I read it in 45 minutes, and it was OK, but I don't think I got my money's worth."
5,The best source for the would be writer or illustrator.,"I've recommended this book countless times for patrons during my twenty year library career and now I am using it for myself. Not only are there helpful, instructive articles by professionals about the publishing industry but the 750 listings help to narrow down the search for a publisher, rep or agent. It may seem daunting at first but the editors do most of the work for you. Getting work published is a send and wait game so sending the work to a firm ready to look at your work makes the process easier. CWIM includes professional conference as well as agents, art reps and of course publishers and magazines."
1,this is what you call a hit,50 and olivia are the new ja rule and ashanti it's official on here this song sucks 50 can't sing and olivia I'm glad she was dropped from g unit she sucked.
1,Dookie Shop,"I cant believe this is the same guy who clowned Jarule for making pop records when he is making vomit inducing b***h music like this. The beat provided by Scott Storch sounds like cheesy background music for a porno flick, 50's lyrics were as juvenile as this record and Olivia should be banned for her Ashanti-like singing. Just another grotesque sex record from a hypocrite who got rich and stopped trying. Nothing to see hear folks. MOVE ALONG!!!"
1,Save your money!,"If I could rate it a ""0"", I would. When we finally got it put together, it would not stand upright and would only fall forward. After spending two hours helping my son put this together, we couldn't take it apart fast enough to put it back in the box and return it to the store."
2,Not as expected,This blanket was simply a thin pashmina scarf with a satin border. I was expecting something a little more thick and blanket like. It's also dry clean only so not practical at all for a baby. The color pistachio was really more like a aqua blue than a green. In the end I returned this product due to it not being practical or the color and thckness i was expecting. It is a nice product but not what I was looking for.
2,88 aerostar 3.0 Base with a/c,"Motorcraft YG275 Heater ValveCan't find anywhere under the driver side chasis nor engine compartment , heater hoses lead to heater core & water pump . any same vehicle owner comment ??Ford aerostar 1988 3.0 with factory a/c"
2,ok,"it didnt teach anything i did not know, it might be good for someone who just started and does not know anything about finances"
5,The Best!,"The best of the series,without a doubt.Filmed on location in Georgia,this episode has a different feel than the rest of the series.A free spirit,fun loving episode,yet still with Jesse Duke's inbred decency and character upon Bo and Luke.Future episodes clashed with this debut's statement that Luke owned a car that he loaned to Cooter,and the lack of mentioning that Cooter owned a garage (Cooter was far more wild in this episode than he would be later).To think if the series would be different if it had stayed in the Covington area and not Hollywood boggles the mind....imagine a ""country"" show filmed in the country...that would be unimaginable!!!If you have never seen this episode.....you need to....the action and characters ""actions"" will surprise you!! But thats a good thing!"
5,Purchased for our mini farm.,"Purchased this for our mini farm. Excellent industrial grade, recognized world wide by many industries. No more worries a out people trying to find a place to put their butts, or of impromptu fires. Appealing design ... looks great! Loud color stands out!"
2,The top is Plastic,"I believed this was galvanized steel receptacle - not plastic with a cheap made bucket. I could have purchased something much cheaper and had the same look/feel. The bucket does not feel like Steel and the thing is light - more like aluminum. Maybe I misunderstood what 'Poly' meant - that's a mistake I won't make again. I purchased 2 of these items for a state building - hopefully, they last longer than a few months. I don't recommend if you are like me, looking for something durable made of steel."
1,Shuttle Discovery's Historic Mission (Blu-ray),"Being a new Blu-ray owner I was anxious to acquire some high resolution material. This was one of three discs in my first order and a quick lesson in shopping blind. For full disclosure I will reveal that we only watched about the first half of the feature before hitting ""eject"". At best, 10% of this program was high res, mostly familiar footage of ground based NASA training, etc. All of the shuttle lift-off and orbital footage was standard res or worse, presented as a documentary and fully narrated. Very disappointing and a waste of money. The other two discs in the order were quite nice."
2,Do not buy it if you like HDTV,"I ordered this item and was very impressed by the first 2 minutes. But then, the whole documentary was captured in Standard Definition with a HDTV Wallpaper. It look's like crap and that's it !.I was deeply dissapointed !"
2,HD Net World Report-Shuttle Discovery,"The title is misleading as too much of the video is NOT HD, but regular, lower quality video, and is a disappointement on large screen HD TV--EJV"
2,Watch out for leaks,"Someone else mentioned that this iron tends to leak water, and it does, but I've only had it happen when I overfill the (very small) water reservoir. Usually happens when I first turn it on and it's sitting in the upright position; once it heats up it seems to be fine.Other than that, works fine. I wish it had some steam holes towards the tip of the ironing plate, but I guess that's something reserved for the higher-end units.----------------------UPDATE - 7/2010: I bought this iron in 2007 and recently it started leaking more, and now it has stopped working altogether. The lights come on, but the plate never heats up. You can't even take it apart to check for a blown fuse or something because there are security screws on the bottom. I no longer recommend this product at all.----------------------"
2,"Good for a what it is, $25","I purchased the iron almost two years ago. I still have it. It worked great in the very beginning, but it did begin to leak and spit water out while ironing. As the other reviewer noted, it does leave marks on clothes, but I cannot say it is the worst iron ever. If there is water in the tank while the iron is on, in the upright position, it will undoubtedly leak all over whatever you are ironing.To make it work best, I can only fill the tank with very little water, just enough to get by one shirt at a time. Yes, you have to be ready with small water bottle with a good spout to keep refilling this tank in small increments. The only reason to keep this iron is it does produce steam when it is not leaking or spitting. Needless to say, I am in the market for a new iron."
5,Panasonic DMW-LND52,"This is a really nice filter, I have no vignetting, does not create color aberration or alter the color of the picture. I definitely recommend this filter."
1,"This filter is not ""neutral""","With this filter on, color gets distorted. For example, rainbow tint is cast on white objects, as if you are seeing things through a soap bubble. I guess what you pay is what you get. I had to buy another ND filter from a premium brand. Don't waste money on this filter."
4,Great add on to a superb camera....,"The Panasonic ND Filter DMW-LND52 is a true value addition to the Lumix FZ200 camera which caters for certain specific requirements. Don't expect eye popping effect on the image rendering but do expect improved versatility as well as improved overall camera capability. The filter does the job it is meant for, however, it is only after some worthwhile experience in picture taking that you can actually optimize the use of the filter and thereafter get down to experimenting with it. That having been said, this is not an accessory that you can't do without...the results that you achieve with this filter are only meant to 'artify' images and that is something that you need only when you travel to picturesque locations on a holiday."
5,CARMEN,"Bizet: CarmenVery good - all 4 principals are a delight to hear. Solti's conducting is more restrained than usual, and the better for that. Pity about the cover - no relevance whatsoever to the music."
3,worth the price,"The shoe is better looking in real than the picture, but I cant say the same about the comfort. The material is hard and hence it is better to wear them on days when you dont have to walk much. Overall, it is a decent purchase for the price but it is not on my comfortable shoe list."
2,this was a weird book,"i was just wondering did any guys read this book besides me because the inside cover of the book says espcially for girls, at least in the hardcover i got. i thought it was a pretty bad book but i was wondering if its because im a guy?"
1,DUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMBBBBBBBBBBB,THIS WAS SO DUMB I WAS LAUGHING SO MUCH. YOU KNOW THAT THE KILLER IS NOT WHO HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE. IT IS SO BORING. I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK BUT I WAS DEFINATELY WRONG. I HAVE READ A LOT OF BOOKS BY R.L.STINE. I HAVE READ WRONG NUMBER ETC. THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK I HAD EVER READ. YOU WILL BE BORED OUT OF YOUR MIND. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS BOOK. R.L.STINE SHOOULD HAVE MADE IT MORE BETTER. MAYBE IT WAS A GOOD BOOK AND I DID NOT APPRECIATE IT BUT HE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. THE PLOT WAS NICE BUT THE WAY IN WHICH HE CARRIED IT OUT WAS WHAT MADE THE BOOK DUMB. MAYBE IT WAS A GOOD BOOK AND I WAS EXPECTING SO MUCH BUT I DID NOT GET IT.
3,Hard to get through....,"I found this book difficult to get through. It was somewhat boring with little suspense and not very scary. The ending was a bit obvious ( you'll see why if you read it) and not much happened. Most of the excitement was at the beginning and then it slowed down to the end. By the end, I had to force myself to read the last few pages."
3,Fair,It was the worst R.L.Stine book I have ever read. It could have been better. Hardly any guessing. You know who the killer already is.
3,Darcus @ Starcrossed,"I am such a huge R.L. Stine fan. This is one of the few books I own that he has written. I wish I owned every single one!This book was really good. A nice thriller for teens. it makes you feel horrible for Jamie because of all she has to deal with. How would you feel if you were under the impression that your boyfriend for x amount of years had murdered someone and was coming after you?I love R.L. Stine books because they always have a crazy twist at the end that, nine times out of ten, you didn't see coming.Broken Date definitely did not disappoint."
2,This unit accepts 2 AV & 3 coaxial RF inputs,I've had no problems using with this AV/RF selector. Only issues I've had is I found no use for the coaxial RF inputs because most video game systems use AV cables instead of coaxial RF outputs.
3,Not as good as my older one,"I have one that I bought years ago and these are not near as good as the one I bought back then. The only thing that I saw was really bad about them are the blades are not curved, as in bent across the blade, so when it is cutting the leading edge and traling edge are rubbing in the cut and burns the woods and makes the cutters stick in the wood. That is caused buy being made in China. When they make things they always cut corners and just cheapen things. If it weren`t for that it would be a great cutter, because they did make the shank that goes in the chuck of the drill bigger to a 3/8"" instead of the old 1/4"". Larry"
4,this is adjustable hole saw,Good product but wears out fast. Maybe I'm too hard on this tool.I do not recommend cutting holes into PVC tubing it just kicks back to much.
2,"Review of ""The Splicing Handbook"" 2nd Ed by B. Merry","I bought the book because I wanted to splice high-tech yacht rope, especially the 12-strand braids like Amsteel. This review pertains only to splices related to such rope.The photos are not always of the splice being described (p.84). The illustrations appear to have been cropped to fit the page, which is especially confusing for complex splices (p.88). The hollow braid splice on p.83 results in a weak splice with a bump at a vulnerable location - I believe this is a dangerous splice and that the authors have failed to grasp the workings of the Chinese Finger Puzzle principle mentioned in several places.Conclusion: don't waste your money. Go to the web sites for Yale, Sampson, and New England Rope to get better illustrations and text for free. Also, study the test results from Layline.com on the importance of tapering the buried eye splice tail."
4,How to splice all sorts of line.,"Brief, clear descriptions of how to splice all kinds of traditional and modern line -- braided, plaited, the works. If you're interested in splicing, this is an inexpensive way to cover a lot of ground. Good illustrations."
1,Splicing lite,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! The text is confusing and the drawings unclear. When I sent the author an email for help she suggested I look at a different handbook - so I did - and you should as well. Instead of wasting $$$ just go on the web - all major rope manufacturers have clear concise splicing instructions on their websites - for free.
4,Great how to!,I thought this book was a good read for anyone interestied in learning the different types of splices used in marine applications. Some of the procedures were a bit difficult to undersatnd but if one sticks with it they work out.
5,awesome!!,"i drink a ton of fluids each day - easily a couple gallons - so it's important that i drink something without lots of calories, sugar, AND caffeine. normally, that would mean to a fairly flavorless drink which is the next part which matters most to me. well this tea has been the answer to ALL of that!!i was getting this in bulk at the wholesale club when i lived on the east coast but haven't been able to find it bulk since i moved to the west coast so far. just found it here on amazon and signed up for the subscription...cheaper than buying in the store, and it's delivered right to my door each month for free - how can you beat that?(i am not affiliated in any way with amazon or lipton)"
2,Lipton Changed the Formulation,"I used to search all my local grocery stores for this product and I was delighted when Amazon started to carry it. But now, Lipton has changed the ingredients, eliminating Splenda and adding aspartame. It tastes terrible. If you want to add Splenda, it's passable."
1,Aspartame is Poison,"I recently discovered the debate over Aspartame, and have decided the most cautious thing to do would be to switch to an Unsweetened Instant Ice Tea (there is one available here on AmazonNestea Instant Decaf Unsweetened Tea, 3-Ounce Unit (Pack of 4).) Without going to deeply into it, it took the pharmaceutical giant that created Aspartame 16 years to get the FDA to approve it after years of refusing on the grounds that is toxic. Political pressure prevailed over science and health concerns and the product was approved. This doesn't make the product any safer than it was when the FDA thought it was toxic. Read about it for yourself, I'm going with unsweetened and adding natural sweeteners to it. Cheers."
5,Lipton Diet Ice Tea Lemon,The Lipton ice tea diet lemon is hard to find in stores and I cannot understand why because it is my favorite drink in the UNIVERSE! 8 spoonfuls makes 64 ounces and I drink 64 ounces every 2 days. Yum Yum Yum!
5,Croc2,"Well, this game is much better than the first Croc. The graphics are great and croc moves around quickly and smoothly, while in the first game he is quite slow when both these games are compared. In this version of Croc, Croc is equipped with a triple jump, accesories such as- green, purple, and blue gummi rolls, binoculars-which are completely useless-they don't magnify anything, and mechanical gobbos. This game is loaded with many different levels, which are much more inventive than the first Croc game. Croc gets to ride a giant snowball, race with dantinis in boats and cars, fly an airplane and a glider, and drive a very annoying railroad cart. Gobbos also speak to Croc in this game. The controls take some time to get used to, and the camera sometimes lags behind or shifts into an awkward position, which ""coincidentally"" occurs only when Croc is trying to beat the boss. But,overall, this game is very good, cute, and non-violent!"
1,"Fun Game, Bad Game Play!",When I started playing this game it was fun. But when i got farther in the 1st level it got really annoying because of thestupid camera angles. It was so easy to lose directions i almostbroke the computer. Stay away from this Game.
5,Sturdy permanent digital piano stand,"I got this to use as a permanent stand for our digital piano, and I'm very satisfied with its build quality. The keyboard feels very sturdy on the stand, and everything locks/screws into place well.My only reservation with recommending this stand is that I found I often bang my knees on the cross bars when I begin playing, but it's something that I've found I'm able to adjust to without needing to sit so far back that I'm uncomfortable.The stand is fairly deep (there's several inches behind the back of my keyboard when it's on the stand), so it should work even for deep mixing boards or for putting a narrow shelf behind a keyboard to set a light/drink/whatever upon."
5,Very sturdy and works perfectly,"I've used a couple of different brands of double-X stands, and this one is far more sturdy. I thought it was pretty easy to set up and take down, but there's no manual so you have to think it through the first time. It's easy to adjust the height and width, and it's comfortable for me in both standing and seated positions."
4,"Very sturdy, a little confusing","Stand arrived without instructions, which made ""assembly"" a little confusing (instructions would have made this a 5). I figured it out after a bit, and the stand is very solid and sturdy. Other stands shake considerably when playing, particularly with our heavy keyboard. This one barely budges and is very steady. Just what we were looking for."
5,Sturdy stand,"Pros:- Extremely stable- Good clearance for your legs if you want to play the keyboard sitting down- Adjustable to any height and width- large flat surface on top along with grip pads prevents the keyboard from slidingCons:- Each leg adjusts independently of the other, so you need to keep adjusting it until the top surface is level- Unfolding it when getting it right out of the package is confusing. You need to unscrew the legs completely and attach them to the sides of the middle bar."
4,Easy assembly; works well,Easy assembly; works well. I can see this thing being a necessity if I was in a band that traveled
2,NO INSTRUCTIONS included!!! Can't figure out how to assemble it.,No instructions were in the box.... I can't figure out how to assemble it.The way I have it now-- not sure now what to do.I want to send it back for a refund or exchange...but don't want to pay for shipping.VERY Disappointed in that part.Thus never could really assess the essence of the product.
4,"Sturdy, strong, and portable--now just make it easier and grippier!","This stand has everything that I could possibly need in a stand--it's sturdy, strong, and portable. It's absolutely an amazing value for the money and could be used as a great gig stand (although I use it at home). It collapses into a very small space. I just have two suggestions:1) Include instructions. I had no idea how to assemble/disassemble when I got it, and it's not so straightforward.2) Add grips to the top. My keyboard slid until I added grips to the bottom."
5,Fast Delivery...Product as expected!!!,High quality product works with my Traktor S4 (with Traktor Case) and my Pioneer DJ-900. Highly recommended specially if you want to make sure your mixers and controllers are taken care of.
4,Pudy Sturdy,"It's a good stand, mostly what you'd expect. Two important notes:1. It uses bolts that you have to turn to lock which isn't convenient when adjusting height because you don't know if you have it aligned with the holes while you tighten.2. The arms/feet lock in the open position, which is great, but if you want to transport it, it doesn't lock in the closed position!Overall good stand. I feel safe with my 200+lbs gear on top. Def not a 5 star product though."
4,Pretty good,"Product works as advertised. Quite slim. Looks good. My only complaints are, 1) it really does take a rocket scientist to figure out how to put it together. It doesn't come with instructions, so you'll need a lot patience to put it together. The product itself isn't difficult to construct, it's that they packed it, and then screwed it together, in a space-saving way that makes it difficult to figure out what piece is what. Plus, as other reviewers noted, it has an extra vertical bar in the middle piece, so it no longer looks like the photo. 2) it's easy to hit your knee on the middle bar, but once you get used to where it is, you should be okay. 3) It's quite a bit deeper than my keyboard is, so it looks a little awkward, so you might want to take measurements before you buy this.Anyway, for the price, I don't think you can get anything as sturdy and that looks as good as this, so if you don't plan on moving it around too much, it's perfect."
4,Very happy with my choice,"I needed a stand for my Yamaha P95 digital piano, one that wouldn't sway when I played (like the single-brace X stand) and that also placed the keys at the proper height. This stand fulfilled both of my needs, and for a reasonable price. The other stands I looked at were too high, even at their lowest settings. This one can be set as low as 24 inches, which is nearly perfect for me. The keys are still about a half inch higher than my acoustic piano (which is about 28.5"" from the floor to the surface of the white keys), but I've gotten used to it.My only criticism is that I had to go to the manufacturer's website for assembly instructions. But it's really easy once you figure out which two knobs you have to unscrew to separate the rectangular frame support from the two Z legs."
3,TOO FAST,"TEXT SCROLLS TOO FAST - YOU HAVE NO CHOICE AND CAN NOT KEY IN YOUR OWN OBJECT COORDS. I SETTLED FOR ""TONIGHT'S BEST"" OPTION AND GO FROM THERE. BUY IT HERE, FOGET MEADE. THEIR SUPPORT DEPT IS TERRIBLE."
2,Thomas Mcguane is a very self indulgent writer.,"His charachters seem alot more California than Montana. For example, the main charachter in this book, a supposed cowboy, spends alot of his time shopping, preparing meals of high culinary merit, cleaning the floor, shower, ect. Come on,a Montana cowboy is supposed to be out there tearing the testicals off sheep with his teeth and what-not, not acting like Martha Stewart. And no-one really has a job, at least the main charachter doesn't.They live in a world of self-indulgent make believe that seems alot more California than Montana, which is about grit of Western Code, not Williams Sanoma and Whole Foods."
2,characters seem very shallow,"did not like characters,very shallow. just not enjoyable reading. had to make myself finish it. kept waiting for it to get better"
3,Drunken Cowboy,"I had never heard of this writer until someone recently recommended him to me (along with his contemporary and fellow Montanan Jim Harrison). The novel was short, with many short chapters--it was easy to read and finish. Strewn with suicides, drunken stupors, horses, cowboys, dead fathers and angry grandfathers--I would describe the writing as muscular/male/macho--McGuane tends to lead you up to a tragic event--stops just short of it--and then picks up at the subsequent funeral. I doubt I will try any of his other works, but do not regret reading this one. I did like one line so much I wrote it out "" When your father dies he becomes terrific through the magic of death"". Wish I wrote that."
4,A pretty good read!,"Karen Robards did a good job of telling her story about a family in the deep south in 1769. Most of us have little knowledge of the eveyday life during that time so Robards did a good job of researching her subject. Religion plays a big part in the family life of a southern preacher. His four daughters are who the story centers around. Susannah is the key person who shows southern hospitality and sweet innocence in the matter of the heart. The scene is ripe for her to be swept off her feet by a young dashing--reprobate. Robards spins her yarn telling how these two opposites' paths cross and love blossoms. This was a quick and interesting read. It has a wonderful twist on the prince charming subject. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about southern comfort, history, sibling rivalry and the rags to riches theme."
4,Good book for naughty children,I recommend this book for parents who have naughty children. I found that it taught some rather good lessons for what could occur when one misbehaves. I'm sure you'll be satisfied by it.
1,Very Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this CD. KD's voice was very unemotional and the whole thing just fell flat. I bought this CD espceially for the song ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen. I don't know how anyone could sing this song unemotionally, but this recording was.I'd pass on the whole thing."
3,"singing great, arrangements so-so","I rushed out to buy this after hearing about it but after 3 listenings I find myself disappointed. Of course, her voice is glorious, but does she really improve on or give us a different version of Young's Helpless, for example? On her Mitchell songs, she seems to be imitating her, which is somewhat bizarre. For me, what prevented this from being a great cd are the unimaginative arrangements (the opposite of which is what makes Shadowland one of the great cds of all time)."
2,Boring!,"As a LONG time k.d. lang fan (since 1988), I have to say this is one of her most BORING albums she's put out. How I wish she'd go back to singing Country/Western again and putting out lively, entertaining albums.This is a great album for the insomniac. Song after song, of quiet, new-agey type of music.I even skipped seeing her on this tour because of the never-changing songlist she does at each show, and really didn't want to fall asleep in my seat listening to these lullabies on the new album.If you want to hear some really good k.d. lang albums - get either her Shadowland, Absolute Torch and Twang, or All You Can Eat."
1,K D Lang,"Lang's eccentric lifestyle and musical skills falls abit short in this collection. There are only a couple of her selections that rise to her real talents. An artist, Lang either allowed someone else to select this songs or fell back on her personal twists. Too bad."
4,GUBU,"This album is superb. If you've heard all the songs before, you'll love KD's versions. I think Jeff Buckley's rendition of ""Hallelujah"" is incredible, now I have two incredible versions of the song! She handles ""Bird On A Wire"" better than Leonard himself, and the orchestrations throughout the album are perfect.Buy it!"
2,Canadian Content :(,"Under Canadian Law, radio stations are required to broadcast a certain percentage of Canadian content. My Canadian friends complain that this makes Canadian radio boring. So it is with this CD. Just like the cover, it's all grey and white.There are plenty of talented Canadian artists--k d herself, as a case in point, so why pick these songs? I'm a huge Neil Young fan, but I think it's a mistake for anybody but him to sing his stuff. His songs are personal in a way that doesn't translate well. As for the Leonard Cohen covers--is the world not a depressing enough place without more Leonard Cohen? And why re-record ""Simple"", the weakest track on Invincible Summer? How about some new k d Lang / Ben Mink originals?There is a dwindling number of artists whose stuff I buy without hearing first. I'm afraid k d has fallen out off that list."
2,Hyms of what?,"K.D.has one of the best contemporary voices.Like Streisand her lps range from greatly energetic and inspiring,to out of focus,narcissistic and detatched .Regretfully, K.D. Lang takes all the energy out of these classic canadian songs,by brilliant canadian composers such as Cohen,and Mitchell. She uses far too much effort in making them ""sacred"".Part of their value is that the originals took creative chances. This cd will never rival the original songs/writers/singers.The comparison makes this effort more lacking. I am starting to feel she is losing creative instinct in terms of her production,and creativity.Perhaps there is a renaissance in her future.I hope so."
3,An incomplete set,k.d. lang's failure to include ANYTHING from the great duo Ian & Sylvia in this collection of songs by Canadian singer/songwriters is a collossal omission.
1,What a massive disappointment GET NANA INSTEAD!,"to add to my review of the kd lang mishap...probably her first bad lp....Nana Mouskouri's Canadian Tribute lp is MUCH BETTER featuring unusual tunes done in unusual ways and paying tribute to a broader base of Canadian Talent. As for the kd lp well: Neil Young has recorded thousands of songs. Why do we have to do the same old ones again that EVERYONE does a cover of. Same with Cohen. And there are hundreds of other Canadian songs I would like to hear. What about Burton Cummings? What about Randy Bachman? What about The Band? What about Robbie Robertson? What about Paul Anka? And as for Joni's lovely song A Case of You, Diana Krall does a much more original version on her Live In Paris lp. And no one will ever match Joni doing it. Get Joni's hits instead of this lp and Krall's Live in Paris. This sucks. I love kd but this is a terrible disappointment. The one star is for the lp cover and concept."

2,An all around disappointment,"k.d. lang has made the step to make a commercial album with this endeavor with a very limited reach. And who is she trying to reach? The die hard Cohen fans? You have to be Canadian if you like anything he has sung. Great songwriter, but that ""voice"". k.d. you are no Neil Young and the elevator comes next for those two attempts. The heart is gone from the Joni songs, and Jericho made me cry, pleae try your own phrasing. The best two songs are the Cohhen attempts, all else lacks in any heart , emotion, verve or originality. This album lacks a passion."
5,K.D. Hymns,"What a beautiful CD. I bought it because I haven't heard anything by K.D. in a long time. I've lived in Germany the past 5 years and am probably not as up to date on music as I could be! I'm not Canadian, but after listening to this CD I wouldn't mind it!! :) I think she does a beautiful job on every song. I listen to it in my car and then I take it in the house and listen some more. It has had a calming effect and I will cherish this CD for years!! May have to buy two, one for the car and one for the house."
4,"Not her best, but fans won't be disappointed","If you love k d lang, you'll love this. Her voice still sounds awesome. Her choice of songs is a bit weak, and it's definately not as good as some of her past work. But worth it."
3,Falls a little short,"This album has a sameness about it that is boring. With all the great Canadian songwriters to chose from, why did she have to double up on three of them? And for long-time fans it is disappointing that she wasn't able to produce any new material and instead had to rely on a covers album. Vocally it is excellent. But if you just want to hear her voice, listen to Ingenue or Shadowland."
2,Sadly disappointing,"Let me start this by stating that I love kd's voice, and have since I first heard her many years ago. So, I had great expectations for this album of songs by fellow-Canadians. Alas, it's basically a boring disc. Oh, kd sounds great, but a good voice alone can't save these overly maudlin and drone-like arrangements. `A' for effort, but `D' for execution."
5,Best Since Ingenue,This has to be kd's best solo album sice 92's Ingenue. Her version of The Valley and Love is Everything are amazing! A must have for any kd fan : )
5,Haunting,"This album will not let me go.I have always loved k.d.'s voice, but not usually her song-writing. I chose to buy this to hear her treatment of songs i love.It so far surpassed my expectations, it took my breath away. Her (almost painfully) exquisite voice gets in all the cracks in your soul and then soars above it all.The choice of songs is just what the title suggests, obvious choices or not.Buy it and soak in it."
5,Beautiful,"This is an incredibly beautiful album and showcases Ms. Lang's voice to its utmost. ""The Valley"" is absolutely breathtaking and better (sorry!) than Jane Siberry's version. I'm floored by that song- it just blows me away.If this album inspires more people to explore Jane's catalog of extraordinary work, then it's done its job."
3,Could Have Been A Classic If. . .,"Given the passionate and uncompromising loyalty of KD's fan base, I hope this review will not be offensive.Nonetheless, it could have been a classic had she simply released it as a live CD, capturing all the nuiance and power she brings to the stage. I heard her do several of these tunes on her summer tour before the CD was released, and they all were superb, especially the treatments of Leonard Cohen's material. Her trio was exquisite, and the backing symphony provided a lush tapestry. She fed off the audience, which in return achieved a higher level of excitement.In comparison, this CD seems flat. If I hadn't have heard the possibilities inherent in KD's live show, I would have rated this CD higher.I don't blame KD. But her manager and record label really ought to go to a few more of her concerts. The purity of the shows is more commerical than the studio effort."
5,kd's voice is unmatched!,"As always, kd's voice is so beautiful. The melodies are timeless, beautiful, and she has such a magnificent voice. As someone recently commented to me, ""kd opens her mouth and out comes joy""...very well put."
4,KD's Melancholy Classic,"I watched KD performing most of her songs live from this album in a classical music hall. Some tracks are haunting and will bring a tear to your eye.Why: these have to be some of KD's best vocal performances ever.KD and band have unearthed some great tracks as well, from songwriters like Neil Young and Leonard Cohen. And rendered their songs delicately and lushly as they richly deserve.I loved and enjoyed this album. And would love to watch KD singing all this live again. Until then, this is probably the next best thing. Get it, turn the lights low, and have a glass of red wine."
4,Velvet Voice is awesome,kd lang is one of Canada's best female vocalists. The confidence and polish is evident in these familiar Canadian classics. Total command and precision in every song invites the listener to play this CD over and over. lang is a treasure and this album shines with her mastery of these beautiful songs.Looking forward to seeing her in concert this year with any of these songs.
4,"Oh, Canada!","KD Lang delivers on this disc! Her rendition of Neil Young's ""Helpless"" is worth the cost of the disc alone...but every song is wonderfully arranged and performed with heart and soul."
4,4 1/2 out of 5 - an incredible voice,"This is a wonderful CD from kd. Her voice has never been better. I saw her in concert on 10/17 at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia & she was spectacular. That incredible voice has gotten stronger & richer over the years, and she knows how to belt out a tune.The songs on this CD are slow, yes, but wonderfully done. I agree with other reviewers that the songs lack variety & that the Canadian songbook may be a little stale, but what kd does with these songs is great.The two Leonard Cohen songs are lyrically interesting, especially ""Hallelujah."" kd has also introduced me to the wonderful world of Jane Siberry, who also has two of her songs covered on this CD, and whose lyrics are gorgeous.All in all a great CD from kd. Maybe a Barenaked Ladies cover would have livened it up a little, but it is still well worth adding to your collection."
5,even kids like this album,"hello, I am 10 years old. I like this music of kd langs. all you people who say it is boring and that is junk are wrong. gosh I like to sing a long with the songs. she has the best voice I have heard."
2,tiny and cheap,"the only way the picture is accurate is to say that the earrings are lever backs with garnet tear drops.the setting was larger with the stones set poorly and significantly lower on the earring than pictured additionally the stones were significantly paler [almost brown in color] and smaller than the picture.i sent these back for a return which they provided but i had to cover both shipping and return shipping.dont bother, these are cheap."
2,Poor,"Animation is simply awful!!! Also, don't expect story plots on par with any of the current Batman cartoons!!! Olan Soule's voice just doesn't fit the character, although Casey Kasem as Robin is OK."
5,super video,"This is exactly what it looks like: Superman stories from the 1960s televison series ""The New Adventures of Superman"". Yes, the animation looks very choppy. Yes, the stories can be very childish and corny, but, hey, so was the original Superman television series starring George Reeves. And look how long THAT has been on the air! Anyway, this video is for people who enjoy a nostalgaic journey through Superman's past. If you are looking for the past stories of Superman but also with great animation, look for the Fleischer cartoons from the 1940s. They were theatrical shorts that look fantastic, although the stories are mainly gangster related rather than stories dealing with super criminals which today's audience seems to want to see. But if you are simply interested in a fun look at some of Superman's older telestories, this video is for you."
3,"Ted ""Baxter"" Knight's weirdest hour?","The animation on these cartoons -- which predate the ""Super Powers"" toy line by about a decade, despite the package branding -- is godawful. But the tape is noteworthy for its voice casting: Aside from Batman and Robin, Ted Knight (of The ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Too Close for Comfort"") provides all the voices and the narration. He had to work HARD to do all that characterization, and his take on Joker, Penguin et al. is a hoot."
1,How I view this release,"I have to admit that with each release by ZZ Top, I can hardly wait to go pick it up and give it a listen. However, I have been extremly let down with XXX and this release. I'm a guitar player myself and I learned most of what I know about great guitar tone by Billy. I have not heard what I would deem as really great guitar tones from Billy in many years. BILLY-PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR OLD GREAT TONE. ANY TONE FROM 1ST THROUGH FANDAGO WILL WORK. PLEASE THROW THE FUZZ TONES AWAY."
2,Sorry. Over-fuzzed.,"I'm a ZZ fan since 1974. I have most all their albums. They just keep getting better over the years. In my opinion, XXX was their last great achievement. They started using fuzz box on Antenna and it was great. They had the sound perfect on those albums. Then they put out Mescalero and over did the fuzz sound to the point it where it sounds way too distorted. Billy's leads are adversely affected. ZZ needs to go back a notch to the XXX sound where they had it just right. Example: Sin Pusher -Outstanding fuzz. I don't care for this album except for songs Buck Nekkid and What It Is Kid, which are cool but again, could have sounded better. Same thing happened to Neil Young's great songs when he started using so much feedback it became ridiculous. Come on guys, get your sound straight again."
2,Fun at times but weak overall,"I recently got Mescalero and what a weird and mostly disappointing album. Too many odd noises and particularly inane lyrics, that sound like written by a mutthead. Even though they have never been ZZ Top's strongest point (Actually the opposite) I was expecting a little more.At least you may find some amusing stuff - being Spanish I always like to see or hear words in my mother language in an otherwise English context. Qué lástima is fun though the song is lazy. Billy Gibbons doesn't sound too bad in Spanish. Him singing in my mother language reminds us that the band has always had sense of humour though I don't always agree with their dirty jokes. They get tiresome pretty soon.2/5."
3,not old school zz top,"Billy and the boys seem to stay current as far as their radio friendly techno pop sound goes, but they have lost most of what ZZ Top was all about in the early days! The best songs on this album are the south of the border slow tunes. Especially Que Lastima!Real old school ZZ fans will agree,Billy, Frank(Rube)and Dusty,you guys need to go back and visit your first few albums such as ZZ's First,Rio Grande Mud,Tres Hombres,Fandango,etc.Thats the real ZZ Top!"
4,Let's Guit Crunchy!,"Crunchy. That's the best way to describe this release. The tuned-down guitars on the title cut are a perfect example of the ZZ Top cool crunchiness. Of course it's full of the musical kitsch that made them famous. Don't expect deep meaningful lyrics and orchestral arrangements. It's ZZ Top for God's sake, and they pull it off very well. Just fun beer swillin', southern boogie, millenium style, like ""Piece"", the 2000 era answer to Tush. This is not your father's ZZ Top!"
4,The Top's still spinning,"This is not a big leap forward, sideways or any other way, it's another fine set of songs in the ZZ Top tradition. They are fuzzy, bluesy, catchy, quirky, and just what the doctor ordered in the bland 2000s. Buy, listen loud (listen really loud), and you'll be rewarded with the strongest set of ZZ material for many a day."
2,if youre thinking about buying this...,"my advice is don't. go find a good Lightnin' Hopkins, Elmore James or Junior Wells cd. i have Rio Grande Mud, Deguello, and Afterburner, been a fan since late 60s/early 70s (bought their 45 of Salt Lick on Scat records) around Houston area, but this is not what i consider up to their potential."
4,ZZ Top Getting Back to Basics..Again!,"This is raw ZZ Top, as you might remember them from from their early 70's style of music (with one or two track exceptions.) I am thoroughly enjoying this album - not a true Tres Hombres/Rio Grande Mud classic, but the band have acknowledged that blues, with some good ol' rock boogie is what they do best, rather than the synthed-up efforts of their late 80's music. Recommended."
4,Outstanding,"Great stuff! After a few attempts of unsuccessful but necessary experimentations (Antenne, Rhythmeen and XXX) the guys are BACK with a fantastic and ultimately authentic sound. It makes ZZ TOP a rare, superb collective of creative/talanted musicians."
2,"Just a few good songs, the rest is crap","I am a very big fan of ZZ top and, believe me, Most songs on this record are quite shallow and uninspired. Terrible singing in spanish also. You only 5 or six few decent level songs"
2,I had my hopes but...,"I had high hopes that this album would be something great. Sadly there is only one really good tune ""What Would You Do"", its the kind you would want to listen to again and again. The rest... geeeze, makes me wonder,what happened to this band?While trying to get through the rest of the album, I thought, 'who is giving them advise? Are there people around them telling them this stuff is good?'So much of this album seemed a painfully feeble attempt to stay cutting edge and ended up sounding really bad.ZZ Top IMHO should go back to being what they used to be 'that little ole' band from Texas', putting its signature style to the traditional sounds of its roots and stop trying so hard to be hip. I still think Billy Gibbons is one of the greatest guitar pickers ever."
4,"ZZ Top's ""Mescalero"" ROCKS!","I have been a ZZ Top fan since the early '70's! My first ZZ Top album was ""Tres Hombres"" which is a CLASSIC! ""Mescalero"" is the best album from the boyzzs since 1996's ""Rhythmeen""! ""Mescalero"" has moments that remind me of ""Tres Hombres"" as well as ""Eliminator"" and I'm glad that they have taken a few steps back to produce their best album in 7 years! A welcome addition to any ZZ Top fan's collection! Enjoy it!"
4,Billy Gibbons for President!!,"These guys just won't stop and here is another perfect example of a ZZ record covering styles from every period of their career. A little La Grange, throw in some Deguello influence, a single right out of the Eliminator years, and a few surprises, namely a distorted ZZ classic sung in Spanish, and here you've got a solid record. They also do a rockin' cover of an old blues gem called Tramp. Get this record."
3,"Great Music, Lousy CD","This is the best ZZ Top CD for over a decade. The humour is there, the dirty fuzz sounds are there, the techno beats are not.Worthy of more stars except the CD quality sucks. I at first thought it was just ""volume maximised"", ie. the recorded level is set way to high. But no, gross distortion has been introduced by deliberate digital hard limiting, the amount varying from track to track, presumably depending on how ""gritty"" they wanted each track to sound. The result is just bad sound. This is the worst mastered CD I have come across.If they wanted a gritty sound, the correct way to do it is before/during mixing. Apply hard limiting to the guitar, not the whole damn thing. Yuk.Avoid European copies - they have the added benefit of ""copy protection"" deliberately introduced data errors."
5,These boys keep on getting more creative!,"As a fan from the first album, this ""Little Ole Band from Texas"" still keeps you guessing! Instead of plodding along in the same old groove like other bands, every album brings a new flavor to their sound. As always, there is great humor here, but the boys, and especially Frank on the drums, really shine on this release. Packed to the gills with a wide range of style and sound, I can't get enough of this disk!"
1,IS THIS REALLY ZZ TOP?,"I have always been a ZZ Top fan and could not believe that ""The Little Ol' Band From Texas"" could put ot such a piece of audio crap! Electronic drums, muddled guitars, grunts and groans vocals all toped off with a ""rap"" track. Don't waste your money on this one. I would rate it a 0 but one star is as low as it goes!"
2,Me So Stupid hopin' this'd be good.,"With ""Rythmeen"" and to a lesser degree ""XXX"", the boys were really on to something- heavy western badlands grunge. Sorta like Black Sabbath visits Lajitas. Predictably, ""Mescalero"" continues ZZ Top's slide away from that sound and back into ""Antenna"" territory. But this album""s just plain silly. With comic art work and mostly goofy uninspired songs, this time they've really got nothin' to say. Maybe they're not trying or maybe they just don't care as long as the bucks keep flowing on ""greatest hits"" concerts.(Ain't goin' to THOSE anymore).One thing's for sure- some of these songs are embarrassingly immoral. America Bless God."
3,to much of the same of song and dance,"it took me 4 times to come to like this cd, which is good thatI paided 15.99 and I can listen to it , your not alwayslucky, but even now its not a cd that has blowed me awayand I look forward to playing every day. I mean they aregood and there are some good songs on it and even greatones but I wanted something new, something I didnt alreadyhave of there's, they need to add some more parts, horns,keyboards, than there would be a new sound !at this stage what arethey waiting for , jazz it up a little but zz top style tho"
3,Its ok,"The game is alright. My 5 year old has a hard time learning how to use the arrow keys. Thats the only way you can race. But with practice he will get it. The graphics really aren't that great, and the races themselves are too hard for the target age. Otherwise it is fun. You can play a two player game. That is the only plus I can think of though."
3,A scholar's take,"Enough nepotism here. This is a solid work in an area that has long attracted the interest of scholars of the colonial frontier. What really gives Hinderaker's work some novelty is the way he addresses economics in the imperial contest for the Ohio River Valley. The one glaring weakness of the work is the sparing use of French and Spanish primary uses, particularly those not readily available in English translation. Still a well-written work w/ some new insights."
5,Compelling and Fascinating Narrative,"This book examines a little known subject at great detail. The author is obviously well subjected in the material. He offers new insight to a foggy chapter in our country's development. While it can be ponderous at times, the overall book is a jewel that will play an important role in your early American book collection. I strongly recommend it (and I am not even a relative!)"
3,Great DC atmosphere but at what cost?,"Pelecanos' hip pop-culture references cannot sustain this clichéd novel. The boozing detective angle has been mined for all it's worth and the author adds little to the genre. His romantic relationships are particularly uninteresting, and his sexual exploits (under the influence of alcohol?) are patently absurd. While the descriptions of DC and its denizens are amusing to a native, Nick Stefanos lacks the hardboiled charm of Marlowe and doesn't measure up to the PC smugness of your average cat detective"
3,Mew seems to be walking a tightrope,"The Danish quartet Mew may yet be onto something potentially great. Certainly, ""And the Glass Handed Kites"" offers many transcendent moments when the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In those moments, the soaring vocal choruses, guitar riffs, rippling bass, and pumped up percussion break through a cloying veneer of overproduction and nagging strings.Mew seems to be walking a tightrope, part power, part emo, but the strength of the songs and performances win out. Singer Jonas Bjerre, guitarist Bo Madsen, bassist Johan Wohlert, and drummer Silas Graae still have plenty of time to hook up with some producer such as Brian Eno or Daniel Lanois who could shift them to the next level, diminish the strings, and focus on the core elements that drive the sound.If you are like me, the awful CD booklet with an unreadable italic san-serif type and poorly rendered artwork does little to tempt the curious. Let's hope for improvements on Mew's next release."
4,mew.....the new RIDE.oxford's(noise/shoegazing band)?,"yeap enuff said ...personally i think mew are the new 'prince' of old-school noise/shoegazing alongside radio dept and the gods,my bloody valentine,jesus and mary chains and other many soundalikes.if u like ride's nowhere and going blank again,and all of my bloody valentine discography and jesus and mary chains,buy this...u'll never regret..."
4,the cat's mew,"this album is absolutely great, if you liked frengers it means you have a great taste which means you will like this one after a couple of times also. and the guest vocals by j.macis are an amazing surprise."
3,A Diary from Dixie,A nice view of the war from an old lady who meet with some of the southern leaders. I includes charming gossip & some of the stark reality of war.
5,Correction please,"Dear Amazon,Please change the spelling of Chesnut to reflect only one ""T"" in the last name.Thank you.BC"
5,Great Read!,If your interested in Civil war diaries like I am this is a must read! Couldnt put it down! Nice to hear fom the women during the civil war...
2,Civil War USA,Very hard to keep yourself involved in the story as there are constant footnotes that you have to keep referring to...
1,Almost illegible PDF,This is a PDF of the diary. Buy the book if you want to be able to search or highlight passages.
4,A Diary from Dixie,I found it interesting in how the war went forward and how she saw it. I also found it disjointed and at times hard to follow jerk train of thought. There were times also that the war should have been shorter. She got bogged down on to much every day items.
4,If you are in visual comm. field - you should have this.,It makes a brand new perspective on your work and the world around you.
5,Eternal Love,"I really enjoyed this first person story about love. The novel is about memories and problems that survive death and the passage of time. Forty years after his death Walter comes back through Micheal to get some things straight. Rather than getting answers he put his life in perspective. As part of that process he finds out what his life meant to the ones he left behind.Does love survive the grave? I for one believe that those who died are still with us in spirit. I am assured that those who are gone still care for us as we still care for them. This book makes a good case for the durability and permanance of love.This book is easy to read, thought provoking and very entertaining."
3,All Sizzle No Steak,"This book had good potential but kept letting me down! It tried to be edgy with the music you've never heard of and the lesbian sister and it just came accross as trying too hard. The heroine is a bit drippy and doesn't know her own mind. She seems a lot younger than 18 and since I can't respect her, it's really hard to like the book. Get it from the library ... I doubt this will be read more than once."
5,My Son LOVES this Farm!!,"My 2 year old absolutely loves this toy! He received it when he was 6 months old and it is STILL one of his very favorite toys. It is super durable (the only thing that doesn't work is the sound effects for the see-saw.)The Mega Blok animals that come with it (a cow, pig, and hen) are sooo cute. My son has had hours upon hours of pretend play with this toy. I would definitely recommend it!"
3,Not overly impressed,"Bought this for our 11month old for Christmas. It makes some farm noises and has a tractor that she likes, but otherwise hasn't been too interested in it."
5,"A brilliant defense of democratic, revolutionary socialism","Daniel Singer's newest work is a brilliant analysis of contemporary capitalism and a direct and convincing challenge to the notion that ""there is no alternative"" to the current social system. Singer's defense of the classical Marxist view that capitalism is incapable of providing a meaningful and secure existence for the majority of the world's population is accompanied by an equally merciless critique of both the former bureaucratic regimes in the USSR and Eastern Europe and western social-democracy and liberalism. For Singer, the alternative to both the barbarism of modern capitalism and the failures of stalinism and reformism is a mass, democratic movement of working people. Only such a movement, beginning in the workplaces and extending its challenge to all aspects of social life under capitalism, could have the power to overthrow the existing system and create a humane and democratic socialist alternative."
1,Cant and rhetoric,"This is a couple of articles padded out into a book. The potted histories of the USSR, Poland etc. are completely superfluous. The only original work is in the last 3 chapters. Even there, however, there are lots of problems, including more secondhand histories for no reason. Social Democracy is dismissed in a few pages as ""in crisis."" This allows him to make the case for revolution instead of reform. When we finally get to the argument, he makes no attempt to respond seriously to potential objections. In short, very heavy on rhetoric and cant, and very light on careful analysis."
3,Gets the job done...,"I needed to replace the battery for my Zen Xtra, and this looked like it would work. Like another review said, it's a bit too small. I had to cut a guitar pick into a sliver and slide it in between the battery and the body of the MP3 player to keep the battery from losing contact.It works fine, holds about a 6-8 hour charge. I wish it was big enough, I hate modifying new products out of the box like this. But, it works alright, I'm happy."
4,Great Product,"Like others, I noticed this item was just a tad small and had to work some magic to get it to fit correctly - no big deal at all.The battery died after 7 months, which was a little disappointing, but the company stands by their products, and sent me a warranty replacement for the battery."
3,"Not quite big enough, but with a bit of engineering.....","The battery is not quite big enough for the hols in the Creative Zen Xtra and it slips enough to lose contact and turn the player off instantly. I used the cardboard box it came in, and cut it in to several thin strips which I used to shim the battery up against the contacts so it will not slip away. This seems to work well: it took the full charge and it has lasted much longer than the one I purchased directly from Creative. It works about 6 hours before I had to recharge; not as good as my i-Pod or SansDisk, but it still works just fine."
4,Interesting take on LvB's Violin Concerto,"Tetzlaff is a fine violinist, and while in this performance, he's hardly the last word in refined tone and intonation, Beethoven's music is all there in bone and flesh. In that way, the performance is a very worthy one: too often, this piece can seem like aimless note spinning or tone production exercises. Not here. Gielen's accompaniment is alert, although there is a wicked tape splice or something at the very opening, which is certainly startling. The sound isn't the last word in audiophile engineering, but it is fine nonetheless.Whatever you do, however, do not buy this recording for the piano concerto--unless you suffer from insomnia. It is well-played, but dreadfully boring. Given the price, however, who cares, when the violin concerto is so rewarding!"
2,The Simpsons,WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS GAME I WANTED IT SO BAD. I GOT IT AND PLAYED IT RIGHT OFF THE BAT. AND BOY WAS I DISSAPOINTED. THE GAME WAS POORLY MADE. I THOUGHT YOU COULD MAKE A LOT BETTER CARTOONS THEN THAT. THEY DON'T EVEN REALLY MOVE. AND THE SOUND CLIPS BITE. PEOPLE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT. IT IS NOT HORRIBLE BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BUY FOR 10 DOLLARS. PLUS YOU WILL GET TIRED OF IT RIGHT AWAY. AND IT IS VERY HARD TO CONTROL. THE BOOKLET DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. I HAD TO LEARN BY MYSELF AND THAT TOOK AWHILE.
4,Love The Simpsons? Love This Game!,"If your looking for hours of Entertainment and Enjoyment, you've come to the right game! The Simpsons Cartoon Studio Game is ABSOLUTLY AWSOME....If you are a fan of the simpsons. I am 13 years old writing this review....and I will tell you if your kids like the simpsons, get them this game. I got this game 2 days ago and allready am a pro at it. You can do everything from Add Props,Add Almost all the characters from the show and make your very own unique simpsons episodes...and watch them...When you're done and proud of your work...Send it to a friend...Even if they dont have the game! From the Moment you start this game you will love it. You can make simple 10 second cartoons to 10 minute long ones! If you are a parent of a kid around any age, get this game...they will absolutly love it! Its Fun and Exciting...And when the kids arent home...you can use it and get loads of laughter! DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF NOT BUYING THIS AWSOME COMPUTER GAME!"
2,"Nice Graphics, Sloppy Play","The ""Simpsons Cartoon Studio"" by Fox Interactive marks the first time the Simpsons appeared on a CD-ROM based program for computers everywhere. When I first heard of it, I thought it was great that everyone's favorite dysfunctional family were coming to PCs everywhere, however when I purchased the finished product, I was disenchanted.The game, which should appeal more to children between the ages of 6-14, allows the user to create cartoon scenarios using various characters, settings, and props. Allowing the user to create their very own episode might sound like a great idea, however, it is not. The instructions weren't too helpful, and about the only cool thing about this product is the packaging.In other words, if you are a die-hard Simpsons fan, and must have everything with their likeness on it, then purchase this CD-ROM. If not, I would skip over this and purchase a collection of Simpsons episodes now available on videocassette for an enjoyable evening."
4,Pretty good but hard to control!,"At first I hated this game, I didn't know how to control it! So I was so angry, but then I played it for a while and it was very easy, this is a great game but gets boring after a while but it still pretty fun so if you are a big fan of the Simpsons, get this game!"
1,horrbile,"imagine a game were you create stuff that cant undo. WELL IT JUST BECAME REAL! you cant make new scenes, probs bite, sound clips bite, you can never get the correct animation, and it comes with no instructions and impossible to use! dont spend a penny on this!"
2,Only for Collectors,"You'll find on this album only unknown songs of the very early Golden Earring era. They were then still a quite mediocre Dutch band. There's no ""Radar Love"" or ""Buddy Joe"" on it. If you're a fan of the band or a collector than this album may be interesting. Unfortunately there is no good ""Best of"" album of Golden Earring available in the US yet."
4,Upset about no DVD,"This is a great movie, and depicts one of the long-time status symbols of the West yesterday and today.I have it on VHS and didn't pay that much for it. But, because I have watched it time and again, my tapeis showing wear. I would love to have the DVD. This movie is special to me because it has Ben Johnson in it,and he and his wife were regular customers of mine in Thousand Oaks, CA. He was a very nice man and alwaysthe gentleman cowboy.The characters are real, the events exciting, and the language true to life. The movies of today with all theirspecial effects lose a lot of the greatness of real acting. This is a good human interest story, as well asfamily interactions and dysfunction. It reminds those who watch about the importance of preserving the rights ofthe elderly, and of tradition."
1,Not what I expected.,The video was not what I thought I was ordering. The beginning of the tape not in good condition.
5,WHY WONT SOMEONE GET THIS MADE AVAILABLE,"This is a GREAT movie, Funny, adventursome, good music western. I fail to understand why all these years, it has never been made on DVD, or at least someone like you AMAZON, make it available to stream, at least that would be something. Its major agravating, how there are many great movies that people would buy, but they wont make them."
4,how to master a great golf swing,I was chosen as one of the top golf instructors of the nineties in L.A. and Palm Springs and many of Ms. Lupo's techniques are similar to what I taught. I particularly liked the drawings by her husband. A couple of her swing ideas are a little off the mark but most are accurate and very good.
4,Hip Hop At It's Finest,"Skillz fianlly has a album see the light of the day in the commercial form. I remeber when I first heard back in 98 on the Are U That Somebody remix and on To My from Tim's Bio album. The CD features production by The Neptunes, Timberland and some others. Pick this up if you want some real hip hop."
1,Painful.,Yes you wont know the pain until you realized you've wasted your money on a CD that is not only dull but just plain bad. Don't do it.
4,used this book to break the big news...,"When I looked through this book and read the quotes, I knew this would be the perfect way to break the news of becoming pregnant to my husband, mother, and relatives & friends. There's a quote/photo that's appropriate for almost anyone. I direct each of my friends to ""their"" quote, using a bookmark that has a color copy of my positive test on the back. Everyone loves it!Even if it's not used for this purpose, I would recommend the book. The pictures are beautiful, the quotes are touching, and the feeling is wonderful."
5,Stunning!!!,Anne Geddes is truely gifted at photographing children and letting their spirit and innocence show through. The pictures are beautiful and breathtaking.
1,creepy!,"God, her pictures give me the willies. The kids look embalmed. I'd never let her photograph my children. I fail to understand why these photos are so popular."
2,"Been There, Done That","More of the same from Anne Geddes. Yes this imagery is cute, but if you want to see photography with true soul and beauty, look at ""Enchanted Childhood"" by Lisa Jane."
1,deeply disturbing,"I received this book as a baby present. While I was familiar with a few of Anne Geddes' pictures (the ones with babies wearing flowers), I found this book to be nightmarish. Why would anyone want to look at sweet innocent babies in, of all places, surrounded by fungus? (with the JM Barrie quote) Also, the pictures of the babies posing in weird places (like a vase with marbles) is quite troubling. Obviously, the author is using trick photography, but why would someone want to look at a naked baby sitting on marbles? Would you put your baby there? Let's hope not. As one other person wrote, I would never let this woman near my child."
3,Drone on.,"What's the best thing about The Lassie Foundation? The fact that they used to essentially be the band ""The Prayer Chain"" who put out the much lauded (and slightly overhyped) ""Mercury"" album. On that album you could see the boys in the band working toward a drone sound and with The Lassie Foundation, at least on this EP, they have perfected it. Using stretched out moments of distortion and singing that is fuzzed out and hard to discern can be appealing, I suppose, if you're into that sort of thing or if you're varying up the sounds. But an album, even a short one, of this just leaves you with a lacking feeling. It's not bad, just not that great."
4,Bringing Perpetrators To Justice Can Be A Killer!,"Family man and dedicated detective, Joe Jackson has a dilemma. Three years ago, he came dangerously close to intimacy with beautiful FBI agent, Cheryl Chase. Now she has left him a message of distress, asking for his help in freeing her from an undercover assignment to bring down a ring of dirty cops. Against the wishes of his loving wife, Sierra, and long time parter, Vernon, Joe Jackson takes the assignment. However, which cops can be trusted? With Vernon at his side, he collects on his favors from a few tough gangsters from the hood, and sets off to save the woman who would have done the same thing for him; or would she? His decision may cost him his life.Vincent Alexander weaves a fast-paced tale of passion, murder and deceit, which will keep readers on the edge of their seats."
3,Fast pace and exciting,"My only real complaint was that the pacing of Black Rain, for me, was much too fast. Though I enjoyed the story, it was difficult for me to identify with Vincent Alexandria's protagonist, Detective Joe Johnson. The author, however, did a great job in getting into the heads of the antagonist and undercover Special Agent Cheryl Chase.Black Rain is definitely worth reading.Lost HoursThe Friday HouseXiii"
1,Worst Book Ever,"This is by far the worst book on the subject of control systems ever printed. I can't believe my professor in college assigned us this book knowing how bad it was. Maybe there wasn't anything else available at the time...(1996). I seriously doubt this. The publisher's did a mickey mouse job putting it together, from the binding to the orientation of the pages. Typos are everywhere and formulas are wrong. Nothing looks right and neither do the concepts. The book looks like it was made in someone's garage. This book wins the prize for worst book of the millenium in my view. If you have this book, throw it away. Don't bother recycling the paper - it's not worth it. Get another one."
5,another good adventure,Another good game with Freddi. Our 7yo daugthter likes the Freddi series of games and has played them several times each. They are slightly different and still fun each time.
2,Last time I will purchase a MegaBloks set,"I purchased this for my 6 year old son who is a wiz at legos. After many tears and attempts to put this together, mom/dad, cousins, and aunts/uncles stepped in to try and put this castle together. These bloks will just not stay together. It is so frustrating, I'm almost in tears. Although the theme and dragons/knights are very cool. The castle pieces will not stay together. Don't waste your money on this toy. In the futures I will only purchase Legos, they are worth the extra cost.Edited to add we are now rebuilding the castle with ""Super Glue"" to keep it together."
3,MegaBloks Castle,"If you want to spend at least 7 hours of your life trying to assemble all of the pieces only to have them crumble time and time again, then this toy is for you. Despite having placed the pieces exactly as pictured, this set is impossible to put together and have it stay together. Since it is marketed to young boys it is hard to believe that this toy will have any staying power beyond the first couple of hours. After initial play the castle falls apart and quickly becomes discarded. For the price, save your money and just buy the men and dragons. I plan on complaining directly to the company."
5,WOW!!!! THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!,"it took me a long time to save the money for this because i am only 12 years old. but when i built it i loved it!i rate this 5 stars on fun because i have had hours of fun with this castle. the castle has a prisoner chamber, 2 cannons, a ballista and alot of guys! its not very educational. and its pretty durable but sometimes sections of the wall come off"
2,Looks Great Will Not Stay Together,"I have to agree with the previous reviews. The set looks great but will not stay together. My son, who loves his legos, found this set to be very frustrating. Super glue will be the only saving grace.The entire structure can crumble and then it is back to square one to rebuild, not much fun or educational value in that. If the pieces actually stayed togther then you could rebuild anyway you liked and expand on the original. ""This cannot be done"".You need ""Glue"".This was received as a gift, though it would be fun to add to the set, we will not spend the money."
3,Not the best toy in the world,"My son loved the toy when he got it for Christmas, but after trying to put it together he became frustrated. Some of the pieces would not stay together, we had to use a hot glue gun to make it stay together!!! The instruction booklet also had mistakes in it. Other than these problems he has fun with it.He also has the Man-o-war and had no problems with it."
3,AWESOME YET BAD,"This toy is fun not just to play with but for projects. this is a very expensive toy. i couldnt buy it because every were i go it is sold out, so for my school proct i tried to copy and paste it into paint, so i can draw it on lose leaf paper but the picture IS TOO SMALL!!!!. So i got a bad grade.a suggestion i would make is to get more of these in stalk!!! and get a LARGER PICTURE SCREEN!!!!(...)"
3,Big Dissapointment,"My son received many Mega Bloks Dragon sets for Christmas, and I was hoping they would go together like Lego's. They almost went into the trash can! I returned all of the sets he had not opened yet. My son is 8 years old, a lego expert, and loves any Castle or Dragon toys, and thats why the box sets caught my eye. One falsh move putting any piece together and you have to start all over. I returned the sets to Toy's R' Us and the casheir said that everyone was returning them. What a huge dissapointment!"
3,Mega confused,"I bought this toy for my six year old who thought it was cool when we saw the commerical. So when we opened it and started to put the set together the ""cool"" factor went out the window. However, my eight year old wanted in and started to build with it as well as my four year old, I don't recomened that age at all. Plus the first tier of the castle was difficult to put together, but after moving it to a table it was easier going. If you have a child who likes to build, buy it. But if you have a child who doesn't have the attention span, you may want to save yourself some money and Tylonel."
1,FRUSTRATING,"My son was very upset- we collected all the sets to make the big castle like in the toys r us display. When he finally had enough money saved up for the last set, It was to late. We had thrown away all the boxes and put all the pieces into one big box. One day we decided to build his sets. Well it was so frustrating he has not played with them since. As soon as you think youve accomplished putting a section together the pieces would just pop right off ruining the entire time he spent trying to build it. Overall my son spent over 200-300 dollars, - I would not recommend this to anyone.Mom"
2,AGGRAVATION!!,"I couldn't agree more with the other reviews that I've read. I spent 4 hrs. trying to put this thing together and keeping it that way. Its next to impossible to put together and not have it fall apart. We bought it for our 6 yr. old son who loves the dragons, but got sick of waiting for it to be put together. You definately need glue and alot of patience. Any one who's interested in this,stop and think real hard before you get AGGRAVATED too."
5,Great Information,This book is great if you are trying to conceive. It has great information in regards to healthy living and understanding your body. I have read this book a few times and I refer to it frequently.
1,Not worth buying,"I thought this book wasn't worth the buy...I had bought a few different books trying to get info on infertility....don't buy this one--after all the books I bought and all the time on the net reading up on everything, I'll have to tell you that you can find out just as much if not more info just online googling. And really ask your doctor or see a fertility specialist, but my regular OBGYN was a wealth of knowledge as well."
2,I was disappointed,"I consider myself to be a relative smart woman, but after reading the customer reviews I thought that this book would have something to teach me (since I recently have felt not-so-smart about not seeing a commitment issue in a man I have been dating). It was an easy and obvious read. It may be a good book for teenagers or women who have a history of making very bad relationship decisions, but for anyone with any common sense it does not provide much insight. Most of us know to not date liars, alchoholics, abusers, etc...If you know someone (or are someone) who needs to be told fundamental common sense things, then this book is for you. If you are someone who can occasionally make a not-so-smart decsion, but have the ability to realize it, then I would not recommend this book for you."
4,Good for a Reality Check,"I have this book and LOVE it. It's not the most complex of books you will ever read, and it certainly doesn't delve deep into the psyche of the female mind...but it does provide you with some sound advice for those times when we excuse or overlook certain traits that, if our friends were involved with men who were exhibiting the same traits we'd be all over them with advice.This isn't a 'self-help' book, but does provide you with the necessary grounding you can get when you are a smart woman trying to make a go of it in our stubbornly coupled society. We can often overlook what our smart selves would see as a blatant flaw. 'Smart Women..' just reminds us that the behaviors we might be so easy to excuse at the expense of a boyfriend really are pretty awful or could signal something more.I recommend this book for young women or single woman who struggles occasionally with the topsy-turvy world of dating."
4,if you are just out of a crappy relationship and/or under 18,"do read this book. It will help set boundaries you might have lost or have not yet set. If you are over 18 and ""together"", OK in your head about who you are and what you want/or not, it might sound obvious, but some things are OK to be reminded of. In any case, its a tiny book, and time invested in it will not be wasted."
5,A must-read,"This book is so real, cuts through the b.s., and tells women what is essential for keeping sane in our relationships with men.I picked up ""What Smart Women Know"" in a bookstore about 15 years ago, when I was 21 and in a bad relationship. I have kept this book, and I know it has helped me through many other relationships, over the past 15 years.I am not even going to cite sayings from the book, because I couldn't do it justice that way.I feel lucky I wandered into that book store and grabbed this book. I have read many other self-help/relationship books, and they did not help me in any way near as much as ""What Smart Women Know""I think many of us would ultimately get the love we deserve if we paid atttention to much of the advice in this book.Go get it, Sisters!"
1,unsatisfied,"I never received this product. Very disappointed! The seller NIBBLES never responded to email, never returned money, and never sent book. I will not order from amazon again!"
4,Loved it!,A must read for women dealing with men who like to play games. I only wish I had read it sooner.
4,Jumper,"The Jumper is a book about an architech thats wants to make a new roller coaster. He finds out that there recently was a roller coaster crash in different places. At the end of each crah the person had left a note. He must find the mystery man before his idea comes to an end.I'm really into architechure so i thought this was a good book. One of my favorite hobbies is roller coaster riding, and the book was about roller coasters so I knew i would like the book. This is a great brain buster book. It was a great mystery.My favorite part of this book was when the Jumper first opened. The Jumper is a roller coaster that jumps over the other cart half way through the ride. I liked this part because of the way Richard Barth described the reaction of all the people. When you read this part it is like you are really riding the roller coaster with the people, it's really neat."
4,LIKE A MADE FOR TV MOVIE,"JUMPER by Richard Barth reminds me of one of those glossy tv movies that puts somebody like David Hasselhoff and Jaclyn Smith together in a suspenseful, if somewhat unbelievable, plot. However, like some tv movies, this one isn't so bad.Sam Garvey, a world renowned roller coaster designer, discovers that someone is sabotaging roller coasters across the country, resulting in death and injuries to many. He is joined by Rachel White, a National Transportation Safety agent, to try and figure out who this madman is, and why the notes left behind are signed by a Greek god.There are no earth shattering surprises here, but there are some tense scenes of the rollercoaster rides and the climactic Jumper ride is appropriately exciting, although the book ends very quickly without any real rationalization behind the villain's motives.A Quick and satisfying time waster."
4,Learn about Roller Coasters,"I learned a lot about roller coasters in this mystery--which is good because they are interesting. Someone is sabotaging America's roller coasters and have set up Samuel Garvey as the fall guy. Garvey designs coasters and is building his masterpiece--a coaster where the carts actually jump through open air. Garvey knows he is in trouble but who could possibly benefit from killing people in roller coasters. Until he can find the motive, all of his expertise won't help him."
1,Not pleased at all,"This travel iron was a colossal waste of money. The steam function does not work at all, it just sprays water on your clothes. After a few uses, the cheap squirt pump in the flimsy, awkward handle that is supposed to manually steam your clothes while ironing as well, failed. It's now in the garbage."
2,Not that great.,I bought this with the hopes I could steam out the wrinkles from my clothes. However the steamer doesn't work properly. It does put out steam but it spits out more water than anything else. I have tried multiple times to get it to work properly and it just keeps spitting out the water. The reason I did give it two stars is because I think the iron works fine and it is a good travel size.
1,Lousy iron,"I just bought this iron from a local retail store for the steamer but like another reviewer said, it didn't work very well as a steamer and just spit water on my clothes. Hardly any steam came out. I worked on my pants for 20 minutes and was still full of wrinkles. Don't waste your money. I'm returning mine."
4,"As Mr.Burns would say,'Excellent'","A very good game,obviously not as funny as the TV show but still captures the essence of the town of Springfield.Now you can roam the streets of Springfield,meet all your favourite characters and visit Simpsons landmarks such as Moe's Tavern,the Nuclear Power Plant and the Kwik-E-Mart. Great fun but may not appeal to non Simpsons fans,though."
1,virtual springfield - waste of money,"I purchased Virtual Springfield for my sons. The computer disc came promptly, sooner than expected. The disc worked one day. Since the one time that the children used this disc, it has not worked. I have tried it on 2 PCs, 3 MACs (it is supposed to be read both by PCs and MACs). I have taken it to work and tried it on my computer at work. We have tried it on the original computer where it worked the first time. The disc no longer works. It is not damaged in any way that I can discern. When I called the technical support number, it rings to a private residence. The answering machine states that it is not the technical support desk. This leads me to believe that I am not the only one who has had problems with this computer disc. Needless to say, my childen are immensely disappointed. Under no circumstances would I ever recommend that this item be purchased. If I could give it less than one star, I would."
1,boooooooooring,"all u do is walk around springfield and look at things, it is good at the start but then after u have looked at everything it [stinks]. there is nothing else to do.seriously, i am a HUGE fan of the simpsons but dont let the amazing tv show make you think that this game is good. its not. dont make the same mistake i did in buying it, you WILL be dissapointed."
2,Fun.... for a little while.,"I am the first to admit, I love the Simpsons... but, this game, after about two weeks gets to be the same old. Yes, there are plenty of things to do, but without a real plot, the game begins to bore even the greatest Simpsons fan."
3,Sometimes not even The Simpsons are enough...,"The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield has two major assets in that the animation and the voices come straight out of the television series. They are extremely entertaining, and practically perfect. But Virtual Springfield is ultimately boring and misguided--it's fun exploring Springfield for a while, but once you realize what the limitations are, and how little variety there is in the things you can see, hear, and do, it gets old kind of quickly. The game's ""through-line"" of collecting cards doesn't really do much to enhance the experience. If you're a diehard Simpsons fan, you will find much to admire about Virtual Springfield, but there is ultimately little to like or to give more than an hour or so of your time."
1,Boring,"I'm a HUGE Simpsons fan, but this game was one of the worst I've ever played! The graphics were awful, they looked like they had been made on a simple paint program. It was boring, everything does the same thing, and there aren't many places to go into. The idea is too simple, they should have put in some games. Its hard to find your way around, without the map you would be stuck. They only thing I liked about the game was seeing The Simpsons characters talk and stuff, and you can see that on TV anyway! All in all, this is a waste of time and will probably fustrate you more than you will in enjoy it."
5,great book,"no man would own her, Suzanna Ruge's mother had been a japanese companion to her father, a british trader. Cloistered for years, Suzanna barely knew him until James Rutledge summoned her to be a translator for his english partner.Suzanna was ordered to cater to Lord Alex's every whim.But she had desires of her ownand her heart would be given only to the man who would win it."
4,ITEM WAS A GIFT. I DIDN'T SEE IT BUT.,"THIS WAS A GIFT FOR JEANNE FOULKE , MY MOTHER. I UNERSTAND SHE JUST LOVED IT, SHE WAS NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING AND WAS HAPPLY SUPPRISED. IT WAS OF VERY GOOD CLEARITY AND COLOR. I HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET."
5,Very good!,"We are a retired couple hoping to learn Spanish to make travel more enjoyable. Using Rosetta Stone you hear the words/phrases, see them written, and see a picture showing the word or action. You can speak the language and write it. It provides lots of review. We were afraid we would not have the self-discipline to use the program everyday. However, we are finding this not to be a problem. You can use it for short periods of time, or for longer if you want. My goal is to understand and make myself understood in Spain. My husband's goal is to become fluent (he took Spanish in high school and college, but never got fluent). Unlike ""school"" Spanish Rosetta Stone does not bog you down with grammar rules. Also, the speakers speak excellent Spanish, not with American accents as many of our teachers did. We think we can reach our goals."
1,Absolute Rubbish - Relegate to Obscurity,"This album from Alannah is a complete waste of time. Despite what other reviewers say it is nothing like her self titled debut or even her second outing Rockinghorse in either style, quality or on any other level.If you like Alannah do not but this CD - you will not only be extremely disappointed but will likely end up questioning whether she really had any talent at all or if she was just a voice that suited Christopher Ward and David Tyson's material very, very well. This release should never have seen the light of day and I suspect it was only released to fulfill a 4 album deal that commenced with the debut.If you have her debut (which is in my view a 5 star release) and you want more try Rockinghorse. It's not as rocky as the debut but is a solid album of good material put together with the same songwriting team and backing band as the debut."
3,deceiving,The photo provided is deceiving because it only shows the back of the lingerie. I took a chance not knowing what the front looks like and I hate the front. The back looks really good just like the picture but the front looks terrible and the cups for the breasts are not fitting and are pointy and hitious. I am not very pleased with the product. I never order any clothing online and this is exactly why.
3,not one of her best,Diana Plamer have writen many wonderful books but this one wasn't as memorable as many of her other books.The characters didn't seem to have had enough depth nor did they evolve much with the plot. But all in all in was a good read to pass the time.
2,Not one of her best,Diana Palmer have writen many wonderful book but this one unfortunately isn't as memorable as many of her others. The characters had no depth and they didn't seem to evole with the plot. But that's okay it was a good read to pass the time.
3,it just doesn't click,"For some reason, this book just didn't click with me like so many others of ms. palmer's have. While the characters are all good alone, together they just made a mish-mash of ideas. Don't buy unless you're a die-hard fan like me!"
5,Gorgeous!,"I got this book to research costuming for my dollhouse dolls. It's always pre-1835 in the dollhouse and this book has made me wonder if my dollhouse needs bigger armoirs. Since buying this book I have been inspired to create elaborate, extensive wardrobes for the dolls and I am having the time of my life!"
3,Bolenski Beat,"I had only heard one track from this CD several years ago while in Germany. Unfortunately, what I thought I remembered was far more ""peppy"" than anything on this maxi. Disappointed, but glad I bought ""used' rather than ""new""!"
5,Best Power Mac Yet,"This is by far the best power mac yet introduced. wow, what speed. but where is the promised 3GHz???? where is the PCIe? maybe next time."
5,"Well, it was the best Apple, it is still the best!","As this unit was produced, Apple published reviews where the speed tests over-killed anything in 3Ghz segment Intel devision. It was a true and it is still the true. Apple ""revised"" they reviews because of the recent twist toward Intel, however if you actually work with this thing you know what I'm talking about ;).This unit the last one in Apple's model line that takes PCI or PXI-X, all of the following units use incompatible PCIe that means that all PCI cards you may have will not fit. I still have very nice PCI cards that work incredibly well and have no intention to swap them. Notably all M-Audio's interfaces are PCI-X and will not work in newer machines. PCIe has a benefits of speed for input-output operations such as disks but for most devises there's no increase in performance at all. The computer is very quite and if you do audio projects it is very important. So far it was reliable and nice!"
1,waste of time,Do not waste your time on this film. It pulls out every stereotype in the book. The dialogue and acting were just dreadful.
3,I wanted to like it more than I actually liked it,"Violet Tendencies is not without its charms. Mindy Cohn's portrayal of the 40 year old fag hag is spot on; she's funny, outrageous, exuberant, irrepressibly bawdy. Watching cheerfully she describe FUPA (you'll have to watch the movie to find out!) to her date, then her understated reaction to his response sums up her character. Cohn's facial expressions are priceless, her acting a sheer pleasure to watch. There are some nice scenes with her gay friends - including a failed intervention (""something's about to go down and I need to warn you""). Violet's interactions with her beautiful coworker end up being an odd non-starter after a very funny early scene in a restaurant.The rest of the film takes itself a little too seriously. The coupling and nesting and uncoupling of the gay couples feels forced.All in all, Violet Tendencies was charming enough but a little less than I'd hoped for."
5,Andreas Takes Great Leap!,"I have ALWAYS enjoyed Embrem films, and I think I own them all, but,. Casper...WOW!!! In this one you reached new heights! The story, the cinematography, the music, I was glued to my screen. Mindy Cohn did an excellent job, as did the rest of the cast...I wish I knew exactly how to say it...but I am in love with this film. Andreas reached a depth of emotion and realism that is amazing to me. And the humor...""Luke, I am your Father?!?!??!"" ROFL!!! Violet attacking the homeless guy on the stairs!!! Salome!!! And you got the Cowboy from the Village People?!?!?! (Sorry, don't think I EVER knew his name) The movie is jam-packed with special little trinkets that all add up to one great treasure.In my HBAO (humble but accurate opinion) Embrem should be extremely proud of this masterpiece. I will probably watch it twice more this week!I have always enjoyed Casper's work...but...man...this one blows me away! Thank you SO Much for this experience."
5,Great for adding 2nd monitor to older computer,If you want to add a 2nd monitor to an older computer with only PCI slots available. For the price this is the card to buy.
2,"Buy another one, this is not for gaming","I bought this card thinking I was going to have a better performence than shared video memory, but I think is almost the same, so buy another."
2,No kanji and no kana.,"This book is for beginners and is written in a very informal style. My key problem with the book is that it does not use any hiragana. Everything is romanji. I don't really have a problem with romanji in a dictionary, but in a grammar the examples should definitely include the Japanese scripts. If they choose to have romanji in addition, that is fine with me.Some reviewers say this book is good because it fits in a pocket. Who on earth puts a grammar in his pocket when he leaves home? Totally ridiculous :)"
4,handy book to have,For a small book it packs a lot of information and explains things quite well. It's easy to carry around since it's light weight with a well designed plastic cover.
4,Pretty good,"This book is pretty good. I like the fact you can stick it in your pocket. One thing I can't stand is books that are loaded with a bunch of ""filler"" space just to make it look like it contains alot of information. I think alot of authors could learn something from reading this book: That it doesn't have to be big to be complete. The material is presented immediately and in a clear fashion. It's hard to NOT understand the usage of all the different particles, pronoun usage, wa vs. ga, etc after reading this book."
4,"Good, but the Romaji is annoying","This book is an in depth look at the basic grammatical structure of the Japanese language. It allows non-linguists to understand grammar by defining the terms it uses and comparing Japanese to English and other European languages. It's mainly for beginners, but intermediate students and second-language speakers could get a more thorough understanding of the grammar rules by reading it. It's nicely sized, too; a ""pocket-book"" that actually fits in a pocket.The only down-side to this book is the use of Romaji throughout the entire text. In the front of the book there are a few reference pages that show and explain the use of the Kana, but the rest the Japanese in the book is entirely in Romaji. Not something I prefer, but it's something Barron's always does. If you're not interested in using the script, or you know it already, then go for it."
5,Japanese grammar review,"Shows basic Japanese sentence structure, verb conjugation, useful words and phrases. Nicest part is it's small and easy to pack when travelling."
4,Great little book,"I am new to Japanese, and I found this grammar book MUCH more useful than any ""Learn Japanese in 10 minutes a day!"" or ""Japanese for Beginners"" books. It's very clear, concise, and well organized. IT not only demonstrates grammar, but explains usage with a gratifying amount of detail."
4,Getting Back to the old Lexi,"Hi--I've been a fan of Lexi since she came out around 1990. I loved that first offering b/c the songs (largely written by Michael Brooks) really highlighted the light and airy voice that Lexi has. I do really like the CD before this one too, however, when I heard ""Trust in You Only"" on the radio for the first time, I knew it was her before they announced it. This CD is a better use of her voice. BUT- I still love the one before that b/c it was mostly praise and worship which is awesome b/c that's what we are made to do... if you just became a Lexi fan and want to hear a Lexi that's a little different than what you know, this is a good CD."
2,Much preparation for very little,I had high hopes that this author with his access to Hebrew would benefit from Yehuda Schonfeld and his own scholarship to advance a Jewish View of the events in the play. But no the book is quite banal.
4,"dumb name, great band...","The name might throw you, but after one listen you'll see this band is pretty good. A cross between Blink-182 and Marvelous 3. Tight guitars, good vocals, and catchy grooves. I wonder what donots means in german?..."
4,Excellent Punk-Rock From Germany,"The Donots have made almost a perfect rock album. It starts with their two Hit-Singles ""what ever happened to the 80's"" and ""superhero"" which can be perfectly compared to the style of Blink 182. It goes on with smashing cues, good drums and perfect melodies and has it's best moments with ""Room With A View"". Some songs are a little bit flat, maybe boring, e.g. ""Don't you know"" but every album has its lower moments. When you reach track 9, ""Radio days"" you will forget every boring moment, cause that's one of the best!!! It ends with the beautiful ballad ""At 23"" and makes the album to a big hit!So, don't think just because they are german they make bad music! Listen to it and you'll know what I mean!!!"
1,Hated IT!,I tried this on the advise of one of those youtube so called gurus! This broke my hair off and within days after applying as directed I still had greys. It is nothing but cloride and you smell it from the moment you open it up.
3,Long but very interesting,"Well written and articulated, the book is very interesting to read. however, the amount of information provided is sometimes more than what you would really need. the book is divided in a general part, dedicated to the subject of cross cultural issues, and a specific presentation of each country peculiarities. The latter, unless you are supposed to expatriate in a particular country (but in that case you buy additional books)is a little hard to stay focused on. however, this book is a comprehensive manual on cross cultural communication, management and leadership. I recommend it to whomever likes the subject."
1,Faulty Ink Cartridge,"Only the magneta ink would print.I placed the cartridge in warm/hot water, let it dry for thirty minutes and was able to print one card I designed, in which all three colors printed.The next day I attempted to print a birthday card and only the magneta printed. I again placed the cartridge in warm/hot (microwaved filterd water for 1 minute) and only the pink and blue colors printed.This is the frist time I've had any problems with a remanfactured cartridge.I believe it is the company's method of refilling and packaging that is the problem. Other cartridges had tape over the copper part that had to be peeled off. This one had a plastic cover. Not effectively sealed seems to be one reason the cartridge was partially dried out.The other reason to consider is the age of the refilled cartridge.I would not purchase from this company again. Sorry.."
1,Re-filled Cartridge,Sorry to say this product did not meet my standards. I print shipping labels each morning for my eBay business and I go through a Canon cartridge every 20 days on the average and unfortunately when I switched to the refill cartridges I ended up using three in less than 20 days!
1,Junk,"The color cartridge was flawed and doesn't give true color.....Only a mix of colors. Obviously,they damaged the ink 'bags' within the cartridge with the color injector when they were refilling the cartridge.I e-mailed them about the problem and they ignored me.I will never do business with them again!!! Amazon probaly lost a customer over this very poor transaction!!!!!!!!"
3,Croc is 3 stars,"Croc is a 3 star video game. It is kind of boring, but the 3-D graphics are great. Another reason why Croc is 3 stars is because it is a very boring and easy to beat video game. Croc is kind of slow too.The game is about a crocodile that that has to save gobbos from the evil Dantini. Gobbos are brown fuzzy little creatures."
1,Son of a!,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME. It does not work on modern computers, so unless you have a really old computer, just forget about it."
1,Poor quality,"The product is much darker than it looks in the picture. Decided it would match the decor anyway BUT only 2 WEEKS after installing it, the hinge screws holding the lid on have started to loosen and leave saw dust on the rim. The seat is PRESSBOARD!! so no repairing that. BAD BUY!!! MONEY WASTED!!"
5,Looks great,"got one for each of my bathroom's, they look great and have had them for a few months with no problem - no cheap hardware"
3,"Love the cookies, but....","The cookies taste great; however, they have no nutritional information anywhere on the package. In fact, the cookies are only wrapped in thin, clear plastic sleeves. There was no individual packaging at all, just 24 thin plastic sleeves inside of one plain cardboard box with no additional packaging or labeling. I didn't know it was legal to send manufactured food products without nutritional information."
2,Lorna Doones now versus then,"I used to LOVE Lorna Doones. I stopped liking them when they eliminated butter. That was decades ago, but I was old enough to notice the change. Many manufacturers stopped using butter (I think Mrs. Butterworth had real butter in it once). Lorna Doones now don't come close in my opinion to their more excellent taste when they used shortning AND butter. If you ever have shortbread made with pure butter, it will spoil you for Lorna Doones inferior taste."
2,Disappointed--,I found these to have a stale taste and were quite hard.I got these a week ago and the expiration date says April but they tasted pretty old.
4,Used to better,Seem to be over toasted lately. Haven't had them in years and when I tried them they were almost crisp. Tried a few weeks later. They are either hitting the shelves stale or they are being over baked. Wish they 'd go back to whatever they were doing years ago.
4,Hot Licks,"This guy cooks!!! Unfortunatly he doesn't get out of the Florida area to do any gigs since his band is made up of guys my age with kids.Hot CD, if you like good blues and hot guitar licks...give it a try, you wont be sorry."
1,Really Cheap For A Reason,"I bought this to hold up a simple 2'X3' poster and After using a full stick on one poster they still fall off after about 1-2 weeks, pretty crappy poster putty, maybe I got a bad pack but just use thumbtacks, might not look as good but 4 of those suckers will hold the poster up forever."
1,A waste of money,"Ok, So I bought this to hang up my posters. So I hung up a Natalia Kills poster and 2 smaller Lady Gaga and 11 by 17 movie poster. It worked perfectly. So then I tried it on a large Final Destination poster and a kesha poster. I came back minutes later and both had fallen. So, i thought I hadn't used enough, so i put more on. 2 minuteslater both fell. That pissed me off. I just spent 4 bucks so my posters can fall. You can't even return it once you open it, so dont even attempt it."
1,NO STICK ADHESIVE PUTTY,"WITHIN MOMENTS OF PLACING ALL OF THIS ON THE BACK OF A LIGHTWEIGHT DRY EARSE BOARD, THE PUTTY LET GO AND THE BOARD FELL TO THE FLOOR. I WOULD SAY THE PUTTY IS NOT REALLY ADHESIVE, BUT MORE LIKE PLAY DOUGH. A GOOD IDEA THAT DOES NOT WORK."
2,No the best putty,"Initially this putty held up my posters and I was happy with it, but within a couple of days they were all falling down (I had put a LOT of putty on each one). I think it was probably due to fluctuations in humidity, but either way I was disappointed. I've since used Command poster strips and have had no problems with that product. My advice is to skip the putty, or at least use a different brand that holds stronger."
2,Not plyable enough....poor performance.,"This putty just doesn't have enough elasticity. Poster board, paper and the like inevitable fall down...especially if it is exposed to cold temperatures....and it doesn't matter if a large or small amount is used."
3,Singing the New Nation,"This is a study of music and songwriting in the Confederacy.Abel sees nationalism as consciously spearheaded from above, a ""goal"" aimed at by the higher classes and imposed upon the hoi polloi (sic). Though some of the more propagandistic songs may certainly reflect such a deliberate effort, it's noteworthy that this view of Confederate nationalism contradicts the analyses of scholars such as McPherson and Gallagher.Abel's discussion of field calls is useful, and he's certainly picked an under-discussed topic. Though I didn't find his analysis entirely convincing, the history of individual songs (I was glad to know I'm not the only person who thinks the words of ""Dixie"" are lame) was interesting. I'd have liked to see a bit more on ballads and traditional music which would have been known to soldiers of the period, but then that's not the focus of the book.Probably a ""get from the library"" rather than a ""buy"" book for most readers."
4,Latter Day Hefti,I think you might want to buy the CDs - I don't know about these downloads but the CD that comes with the book gives only the rhythm section accompaniment parts but no main melody.4 of them can be found on the BASIE-STRAIGHT AHEAD CD - 3 more on Sammy Nestico's NIGHT FLIGHT CD although Basie recorded all 9 himself on various CDs from the 70's and 80'sYou get both ballads from the 2 aforementioned CDs
4,Lost Puzzle,"When I first saw this in Barnes & Noble, I thought ""Cool. I will only buy one."" Then as we started putting it together, it became a family affair. There was alot of foilage pieces in it. There also was no picture to go off of. It was still ok. As we started piecing it together, we noticed that there was very light yellow designs on the back side of the puzzle pieces. It turns out they also put a message on the back side of the puzzle in Glow-In-The-Dark ink. I will not spoil it for anyone, but unfortunately you will need to buy all 4 puzzles to get the complete message.If you are a fan of ""Lost"", I highly recommend it. Also is a complex puzzle as well for you puzzle maniacs."
5,"Fun, tough puzzle","These Lost puzzles are really difficult. I love doing puzzles and love finding one that's a real challenge. However, for people who haven't done 1000 piece puzzles before, this would be frustrating. I loved it, and it does have a secret thing on the back of it after you finish it- but you'll have to figure out how to read it yourself! I won't spoil the fun."
3,Message is tricky in this book,"This is a fun rhyming book with the message that while changing into something different can be fun, it is just best to be yourself. The problem I have with the book is when the main character, Spot, changes into an elephant. The children respond with ""You're very big, you're very fat. We do not care for you like that."" I'm not sure that's a great message for kids to be hearing. They can be judgemental enough without planting the seed."
2,Not as good as the original,"Our son loves ""Put Me in the Zoo"" so we were excited to get the next Spot book. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment."
4,Loved by husband and son,"My son (4.5) got this toy for Christmas. My husband and I put it together in about 1/2 hour. There are quite a few pieces (they are Mega Bloks after all) to put together. The dragons are AMAZING! One of them looks like a dog/dragon and it has freaky hair. There are gems that light up, gates that can open and close and even a cannon that you can shoot stuff out of. My son has taken this apart and put it together his ""own way"" and plays with it very often. This is a very cool toy. My husband said he wants to be a kid again so he can have one too!"
5,The link to making dreams become a part of my reality !,"Is a true story of one mans life his discovery of the power behind sending love, The effect it has on our universe, people around us and the paths we choose to take. You will find Klaus has a unique style of writing, sincere, captivating and full of humor. Klaus manages to bring you the feeling of sitting right there with him, he not only takes you on the path with him but also leaves you with the instructions to discovering your own path. I have found that by following the instructions to sending Love that are described in this book; The link To making my dreams become my reality. This book is truly A great contribution to the universe."
2,Wear out too fast,"The title says it. I used these on masonry, and they were wearing over twice as fast as other brands I've used. I bought these for the low price, but I would have saved money buying more expensive wheels that last longer. I don't see myself buying this brand again."
5,Ode to Joy,"My daughter was so excited when she saw this gift for her birthday. She ran over and gave me the biggest hug and said: ""This is the best book ever, because you can read it over and over."""
2,doesn't fit Mitsubishi Raider 06,"It's the second one that I've tried from Airaid. The first one that I tried was the AA310-618 and now this one, none of them fits Mitsubishi Raider 2006 3.7 L V6 don't waste your time and money."
2,Hogue Grip,"Grip was supposed to fit a Glock 19 but didn't. I tried to trim it, last thing I wanted to do, but it just got worse. I have other Hogue grips that fit perfect but not this one. Threw it in the trash."
4,Definitely made for Glocks....,"I could have sworn I read that it fit S&W M&P pistols, but on the package it lists plenty other makes/models (mostly Glock) and NOT M&P's. Fits about 90% and leaves a little slack on the lower sides, but will work just fine. I guess I'm just being picky because the Hogue I ordered for my SA XD9 fits like a glove! Would still repurchase for other handguns, just need to confirm compatibility."
2,Loose on my Ruger 22/44,"This is so cute. and I like the feel of it. BUT..... I know most guns will require some grip trimming for proper magazine release, which is understandable and I checked to make sure this was compatible with my hand gun. I must give it only 2 stars because the product label clearly states it is compatible with the Ruger 22/45, however it just doesn't fit properly. The issue I have is the grip does not fit snug, it is loose and gaps slightly. So yes its adorable, & I plan on keeping it, but I will save it for future use on a pistol with a larger grip, as the directions state it's not safe to use if it's not snug."
5,Language Art Reading,"HI GUYS!! COMING BY TO LET YOU ALL KNOW... THE BOOK WAS GREAT, VERY HAPPY WITH THE SELLER AS WELL, BIG TIME RECOMMENDED. ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT, BEFORE YOU MAKE A PURCHASE OF ANY BOOK CONTACT THE SELLER AND ASK TO MAKE SURE THE BOOK IS COMPLTE, ALMOST A YEAR AGO SOMEONE SOLD ME A G.E.D BOOK ""WITHOUT THE ANSWER SHEETS ON THE BACK"" [NOT THIS SELLER THOUGH] OTHER THAN THAT THANK YOU ""AMAZON"""
4,The real birth of SX,"Symphony X put themselves on the progressive scence with this album. This album introduces the new singer, Russel Allen.The instrumentals on this album will blow your mind! (actually I can say that for any other SX albums after Damnation Game :D )Though this album is not as great as ""V"" or ""Divine Wings of ""Tragedy"", it is still a decent prog metal album.Here are my ratings: (5/5 would be a perfect progressive metal song)1)Damnation Game - 4/52)Dressed to Kill - 4/53)The Edge of Forever - 6/5, very beautiful song.4)Savage Curtain - 3/55)Whispers - 4/56)The Haunting - 3/57)Secrets - 4/58)Winter's Dream (Part 1) - 5/59)A Winter's Dream(Part 2) - 3/5If you are new to SX then I suggest getting this album first or Divine Wings of Tragedy. The Odyssey is quite different from thier previous albums."
3,Rising Force ?,"Nothing Groundbreaking Here...It's good but I'd swear I've heard some of the identical guitar licks from Malmsteen, note-for-note...just listen to Rising Force. Still, it's good neo-classical metal but not what I'd call progressive ...And don't be mis-led. Any comparisions to Dream Theater are unfounded..they are nothing alike. If you are looking for Malmsteen meets Dio (without the range), this is it."
4,Great Guitar Playing,"What can I say, Symphony X in the early years are just as good as they are now. Michael Romeo is excellent on here. I was a little skeptical about buying this CD, but after listening to it, I realized that this is one underated CD."
3,introduction and the first table are home runs!,"If you have never read any of the good books out there on the ten commandments I suggest you pick one up. This is the first work on the ten commandments I've read since college. The introduction and the first table are home runs! Plumer gets into some 19th century stuff in the second table, I found that part a little boring. The introduction and 1st table take up about 400 of the 600+ pages though.RG"
1,not what it says it is,The cover data was not really gone into in depth. it was more of a story about other marine mammals with several interspersed info bits about the dolphin healing abilities/research. in the bonus section there was about 30 minutes of info that repeated the sound bites with stops for passing horses. I was really disappointed with it as the info was already in text form on the net. no little children nor disabled adults were swmming with the dolphins and no parents were asked about the effects on their children of swimming with the dolphins. save your money! Jere
2,"Don't push the ""order"" button just yet!","This DVD is an unfocused mess that seems to be a loose compilation of ""save the Californian coast,"" ""come take our whale watching boat ride,"" and impromptu, sloppy stream-of consciousness pseudoscience from one ""Dr. David Warner."" This was soooo bad that I really do want about an hour of my life back. The James and Hartley narration had nothing to do with dolphins, and the teaser promo lines lead to nothing of substance at all. Thank goodness this is actually only a one-disc experience. The writers, editors, videographers and soundtrack guys should be encouraged to find other work -- this was simply terrible... all of it. Save yourselves (and your 20 dollars)."
3,Wish there was a better translation,"This review is specifically referring to the Mondial edition of Salammbo. Within the first 10 pages, I counted many sloppy typos - it's regrettable that there isn't really another English translation available on Amazon. The translator must not have been happy with his work either, as there is actually no listed translator - that's the first time I've ever seen that."
2,Good Story. Terrible Acting,"I appreciate any movie that promotes good values and entertains its audience. This movie succeeds at doing this. However, the acting is horrific; to the point that it's painful to watch. It would have been nice if they could have cast at least one character that could act. They're terrible from top to bottom; including the main character."
5,"Wind at My Back, Season 1","This series takes place during the Canadian Depression. The matriarch of the family is someone you love to hate! The story is sad, happy, very poignant. You'll look forward to each episode."
3,Wind at My Back review,I purchased this DVD for my family to enjoy watching together and I do find it to be appropriate for us all and entertaing without being inappropriately provokative. The reason for my selecting this particular series was that it was produced by the the same producer of Anne Of Green Gables which I absolutely LOVED!!! I did not find that it lived up to that expectation but my family and I are coming to enjoy it. The very first episode was a lot to digest in that there were a lot of hardships all compounded in the very first one!
3,get serious,$78 dollars for just one season?!!!? Get serious. I loved this on tv but this price is totally unrealistic. For anything over $20 for any one season you can KEEP THEM!! and that would be for top-notch picture quality.
4,Good stuff,"This 2 cd set represents Fairport's rebirth. Including the first album since their demise (Gladys' Leap) and it's instrumental successor(Expletive). Two fine examples of the direction Fairport was to take but still retaining the not quite polished sound of earlier albums. Oh yeh, the remastered sound is quite nice, as well."
1,Lots of noise,"This is not the album to buy if you enjoy Christian Death's melodic music. It sounds as if Valor dabbled in industrial metal, a la Ministry, and then realized he could do much better with ALL THE LOVE, a far superior recording. ""I Hate You"" is an aweful noisefest featuring a child singing. Very lame. If you like fast speed metal guitars and enjoy Ministry or Slayer, this is for you."
1,Industrial Light Bulb.,"As the other reviewer stated this is an industrial light bulb, it will not fit into a standard home socket. To my knowledge Amazon sells primarily to individuals not companies. Either way it should have been stated in the item name right next to the pic that this is not for home use."
5,"Fully deployed, I am","I don't actually own this item. However, if I did I'm certain I could be confident of a 100% deployment rate. That makes a $225 piece of stamped metal and plastic a ""must-have"" in my book. At some point in the future I hope to acquire the watch bracelet to which I will attached the deployment buckle. The watch itself is out of the question as there is still a balance on my mortgage to consider."
4,Fun & loaded with photos,"This book is not as in-depth as many others on the same subject , but it IS a lot of fun. Gifford's writing style is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, very much like another publication from that time period: Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine. And during the 70s, really serious books on the making of monster/horror/sci-fi films were pretty scarce.But, as the title suggests, this coffee-table sized book is LOADED with photos (mostly black & white with a scattering of full-color plates) and covers American, British and some of the Japanese films produced in the 20th century. You'll spend more time looking at the pics than reading it--which is fine, since the subject matter has been covered in more depth since then. I got this as a kid and it was a great introduction to the horror/sci-fi/fantasy film genres."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time on Web of Lies,"After watching the ""real people"" episodes of Torchwood the animated ""Web of Lies"" was awful. Sorry I wasted my money. Only watched about 15 minutes before I turned it off. No where did I see that it was animated. If I had seen that before purchasing I would not have purchased it. Would like my money back."
2,Do not get this.,This is a very low budget pilot. Only get if you are a hardcore fan. The animation is very obviously meant to just convey a story and isn't very pleasing to the eye. The rest of the episodes in Torchwood are live action.
2,Major disappointment,The animation is a joke (they may have been going for a comic book look but it gets old REALLY FAST). I am usually willing to finish any program I start...they sometimes get better and save themselves in the end...this one failed....I tried twice and just didn't give a damn to the point that I just clicked off and deleted it...can't help wondering who thought this might be vialbe for any media.
3,More of the same a good thing,"Just a quick comment - this is another really strong album by Velvet Crush. But to my ears, somthing is wrong with the production. Though obviously not recorded in mono, the sound is very flat, like something out an AM radio. At first I thought my headphones weren't plugged in all the way - that sort of idea. It doesn't matter as much without headphones, but it bothered me knowing these great songs could sound even better. For great playing by the guys from Velvet Crush, check out Duffy's self titled CD,produced my Mitch Easter."
4,The Velvet Crush Grow Up,"As was the case with Matthew Sweet's latest release (In Reverse), the Velvet Crush have developed a richer tone without eliminating the catchy pop hooks that make this band sound so great. This is the only record of 1999 that I picked up purely on a recommendation. I was well rewarded. With few execeptions, the tracks on this CD will be well worn. This is one of very few CDs that I can return to and hear something new every time. Not exactly a classic, but pretty close."
4,"Great, underappreciated band","I think the previous reviewer, Scott Waldon, meant ""apex"" instead of ""nadir.""I still think that they hit their apex with Teenage Symphonies, but I can certainly see how some people pick this album as their favorite: There is absolutely nothing to dislike on this album. It's all good, it's all melodic, and it all rocks, with superb guitar work. Still, I keep coming back to Teenage Symphonies the most, so I'm giving this album four stars and TS five as a relative rating.That's still definitely enough of a recommendation to buy this album!"
5,Peppermint Tea,"I got hooked on Harney & Sons tea a while ago. Most of the varieties I've tried are excellent, and this is no exception. The tea bags are in foil packets, which keeps them fresh. It's also wonderful served hot or iced. I would definitely recommend this product."
3,"Spend a little more and get the sachets, not the bags","Bought these after going through a tin of the sachets. These are bags, and they are NOT the same. The sachets were so fresh and had such an essence of peppermint without any bitterness (even when a little over-steeped). Even the smell of a cup of tea from the sachet felt pepperminty in scent and sensation. However, the bags just don't do the tea justice. Not only does tea from the bags, as opposed to the sachets not stand out as a peppermint tea, but also they actually have a sort of bleached water aftertaste. I say this probably and only in comparison to the Harney & Sons sachets. Get the sachets. If you are a lover of peppermint tea, you'll dream about this tea from the sachet."
2,Not minty,Lacks the strong minty taste of a good mint tea. This one's too mild for my liking. Would not recommend this to those who like a robust mint flavor.
3,A little too much,"I read the book The Princess by Lori wick a couple years ago and liked it and thought I would give another one of hers a try. But after reading Sophie's Heart I remembered all the reason's I didn't pick up more of Wick's books. I like a good Christian romance but the preaching gets to me if it is too heavy and this book was a little much for me. The main character was soooo good it was over the top for me. The way the children talked was also an issue. I have children around the kids in the books ages and they would never talk like these kids. The whole book was just a little over the top for me. But I did like the story idea, the characters, how they learned from each other, the love story was sweet and the ending cracked me up."
4,Sweet Story,"It is a sweet, clean story with a predictable course of action. My only complaints are the slowness at times and the somewhat ""self righteous"" reminder of the characters church involement and prayerful thoughts.It is hard to find a clean romance, so I gave it 4 stars."
5,Excellent,"The growth of Lori Wick as a writer is clearly evident in this book. I love her historical Christian Fiction, but this book took my breath away! This modern romance has it all! You will become a Lori Wick fan with any of her novels, but this one is extra special."
4,Soooo sweet!,"Sophie, a Czechoslovakian woman who worked as a translator in her native country, finds herself in a totally different world when she moves to the United States...Chicago to be exact. Hating her job as a waitress in a busy city, she soon finds a job in a small Wisconsin town keeping house for a grieving widower, Alec Riley, and his children. What follows is the cutest, sweetest love story. This is definitely Lori Wick in her finest form-gentle lessons about life, cute bits of humor, and a warm love story make this one of those ""comfort"" books to curl up with. I have read this book three times (whenever I feel the need for a nice sweet read) and have loved gentle, caring Sophie every time. The story of love and family healing is one that you won't want to miss...""Sophie's Heart"" will capture your heart!"
5,Another Amazing Example of Fine Christian Fiction!,"Lori Wick has done it again! In her novel ""Sophie's Heart"" she has expertly crafted a fine tale of a young Czechoslavakian who travels from her native country to live and work in America. She leaves her only living relative behind, along with her government position, and finds herself working as a housekeeper for Alec Riley. Alec has lost his wife and is drowning in grief while still trying to raise his 3 children, Rita, Craig, and Tory. I won't reveal any more because this book is so fascinating you'll want to read it for yourself. If you are fan of Lori Wick, Christian fiction, or just fiction in general, this is a must-read story of God's healing love."
4,"TOUCHING, HEARTWARMING STORY","It had been awhile since I had read a Christian fiction book. I enjoyed this book very much. Sophie, an intelligent and highly educated woman from Czechoslovakia, comes to the United States with high expectations and dreams. After spending time in a lowly job, she hires on as housekeeper for a man and his three children, who have recently lost their mother. This job must have seemed lowly and an embarassment for a woman of Sophie's intelligence, but she is determined to do the very best she can. I loved Sophie's gentle spirit and her compassionate heart. She not only changed the hearts of the characters in the story, but mine as well.This book just brings YOU into the story! You feel the emotion that the characters in the story feel. You feel like you know Sophie as well. This story is so touching and it moved me to tears at the end of the book. This seldoms happens when I read a book. I highly recommend this inspirational story and will look for more books by Lori Wick."
5,A Heartwarming Story,Sophie's Heart defintely touched my heart - I grew close to Sophie and was saddened when I reached the end of the book - I felt as though she was a part of me and I didn't want it to end! It was a GREAT read and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys Christian literature. I've read many of Lori's works and she is positively one of my favorite authors.
2,Not what I expected,"This was my first Lori Wick book. I found it to be very slow and boring. The charcter, Sophie, was just too good to be true. She did not seem real to me at all. I felt that there was no depth to any of the characters and I never really felt any attachment to any of them. I almost didn't finish the book, but I did. Long before the book ended, I already knew what the ending would be. There was absolutely no excitement. It was all very predictable. I also felt that the story was rushed. It went from one thing to another, without any time to develop the plot or characters. This was a very disappointing read for me. I really don't think that I will be buying any other Lori Wick titles. However, if you are looking for a book that has little character development and a predictable feel good storyline, then you will love this one. There is one positve thing that I will say. Sopie has a very strong faith in God that I did admire. The storyline, however, was lacking substance."
3,Disappointing!,"I realize that many people love this book, but for me it fell short. I guess Sophie seemed a little too unrealistic--she was portrayed a little too smuggly perhaps. It seemed like she was a bit too perfect. I didn't care for this book much."
4,A classic must-revisit for children of the 70s,"This movie is based upon the true story of James ""Grizzly"" Adams (Dan Haggerty), an unfairly accused man who chooses to live exiled in the wilderness above standing trial for a crime he did not commit. Along the way, he befriends a big, big bear named Ben, and a trapper and his mule. In the TV series (1977-78), Ben was played by a female Grizzly named Bozo.Three sequels followed, with only one starring Haggerty in the title role: The Capture of Grizzly Adams (1982); The Legend of Grizzly Adams (1990); and Grizzly Adams and the Legend of Dark Mountain (1999).As is usually the case, the first is the best. Haggerty and the bear create magic onscreen, and the locations are lovely.Staci Layne Wilson"
2,Not User-Friendly Enough for Beginners,"There are many chess books to give someone that is just beginning, especially a young person. So why would someone choose this? The choice to describe plays and openings with algebraic notation instead of diagrams makes this - well like reading algebra! When trying to introduce someone to chess, look for writing in paragraphs, or easy-to-grasp diagrams. A few parts of this book were interesting (Heroes and History) and this book may be more appropriate for an intermediate chess player, so I give it two stars instead of one."
1,Warning,"Although not so labeled, this book is essentially a retitled republication of ""Keene on Chess,"" first published in 1999.I do not intend to comment on the merits of this work, only to warn buyers that they absolutely do not need this book if they already own ""Keene on Chess."" One star is shown above simply because Amazon's software required me to enter something. #"
5,An eclectic mix of erotica ..Great for lovers of The Pearl,"The Boudoir was a six issue serial periodical so popular in Victorian times giving the reader of the times some of the sauciest gossip of the well and 'ner to do's', ribald stories, bawdy humourous stories, poetry, an advice column, and finally of course, a serialized erotic story .....All six of these issues are reproduced in this book in the same manner as they were first printed. The erotic story in this book is titled 'Three Chums: A Tale of London Everyday Life' and consist of the narrator, Charlie, and his two cousins, Harry and Frank, and their adventures with young ladies of the times.For the student of Victorian times and writings it's a greta book and that is why I rated it five stars, BUT, for the admirer of erotica, debauchery and the perversions of the time then skip it because trust me you're not going to like the dumb humour and definitely the poetry will drive you nuts....."
2,For Avid Collectors Only,"On the plus side, this appears to be the real thing, Victoian erotic memorabilia. On the negative side, it's so disjointed (the stories break every page and half or so, and the poems etc. are tedious). Get it only if you are a true collector."
4,"Great design, could use a bit of QA","My girlfriend and I got a matching pair of these when we started dating a year and a half ago. They've held up beautifully despite their daily beatings over the last 500+ days. Definitely Solid. And I / we LOVE the wave design - it's clean, pretty, and I really like the subtle clever use of negative space for the opposing waves. Like the ying and the yang.My only complaint is the welding on the outer spinning band. You can't see it in the picture, but where the outer-band is welded together, there's about 3mm of welding material, covering an entire wave, and it looks a mess. Fortunately, it's smooth and doesn't really bother me that much. I'm spinning it around most of the time anyway. And it's not like this is a Tiffany's ring -- for the price, it's really hard to complain."
3,"Duramente criticado, pero....",".... no es un mal disco despues de todo. Quizas sea la costumbre de tener al Dickinson como vocalista y por la presencia de ""Angel and the Gambler"", una canción que rompe con el estilo Maiden, puede ser, pero en lo que a mi respecta, me encanta, una canción de más de 9 minutos de duración, tal vez, lo unico chocante sea esos sintetizadores que se escuchan de fondo. El disco contiene canciones muy Maiden como ""Futureal"", con la que abren el disco, rockera, un poco acelerada. También está ""The Clansmen"" y ""When Two Words Collide"" de lo más rescatable del disco. El resto es bastante flojo. No te dejes engañar por el título de la ultima canción ""Como estais amigos"", no es en español, lo unico que dicen en nuestro idioma es esa frase, aparte que es la canción más floja del disco"
2,Not impressed,"This was my first Iron Maiden cd. I bought it for very cheap at a used cd store. Now I know why it was there! ""Futureal"" is an ok song, but it doesnt even compare with their older stuff. ""The Angel and The Gambler"" is probably the best song on here, if you can listen to all of it without getting bored. I guess ""When Two Worlds Collide"" is another decent song, but thats about all. The guitar work is pretty good this album, but that's not enough to make you wanna listen.Definitely don't buy this if you are new to Maiden, because it will leave you saying ""What's everyone talking about? Iron Maiden's not that good"". Anyways, You have to give them credit for coming back and making one of the best albums of their career, ""Brave New World"". Luckily i decided to give them a second chance after i bought Virtual, because their older stuff rules!"
1,GREAT COVER!,"The cover is so coool! If I lived in the big city,and had to ride in a elevator. Say? 125 floors,everyday. This is what I would want to hear!"
2,no depth,what can I say? this is the first maiden album i have heard with Blaze as lead vocals. it is definitely not the same. brave new world (with Bruce back) blows it out of the water!
1,Poor,"This is perhaps one of the worst rock/metal CD's of the 90's, and certainly Maiden's weakest release. Not only because Blaze's voice is flat and boring compared to Bruce Dickinson's (one of the greatest vocalists of rock music) but also because of the songs that sound very flat, very uninspiring..very boring and totally un-Maiden. I think that even No Prayer For The Dying is better than this album."
1,ONE OF THEIR WORST EFFORTS,"I've known (and loved) MAiden for a long time. I still do. But I was shocked when I heard this fiasco called ""VIRTUAL ELEVEN"". Unbeliavable bad. THe song ""ANGEL AND A GAMBLER"" is a joke, repeating its chorus endless times. ""FUTUREAL"" is a failed attempt to reproduce tracks as ""BE QUICK OR BE DEAD"" and ""ACES HIGH"". ""THE CLANSMAN"" is pathetic, trying to be an epic. Well, listen it yourself, but do yourself a favor: listen it first from a friend, before buying it!"
4,Under apprieciated Maiden album!,"Bayley turns out with better results on this release. Awesome album here many classics such as Lightning Strikes Twice,and Como Estasis Amigos.Typical Maiden music. Had a chance to see this tour but cancelled the last minute. More of an atmospheric Maiden release. Snyths are back as well. Ignore the bad reviews. This isn't a embarssesment. Its a very entertaining cd. Buy It! 4 1/2 stars at best."
3,I liked X Factor much better,"I am a huge Maiden fan and the one thing that makes me like Virtual XI a bit less than the others was not Blaze's voice, but the constant chorus repetition on a few of the songs (Like the Angel and the Gambler). I had steered clear of Blaze for decades, but finally decided to give him a try and to be honest, I like what he did with this group and now feel bad for thinking ill of him for so many years (sorry bro, I was a loyal Di'Anno & Dickenson fan). I weighed this album primarily against X Factor because that album was Blaze's masterpiece IMHO (so dark and thought provoking...if you do not own X Factor, pick it up!). That said; Virtual XI is still a good piece of Iron that is much more up-tempo (especially `Futureal' and the iconic `Clansman') and should be included towards every Maiden repertoire."
2,BAD !!,"well.. this is the worst iron maiden album forever. well.. it's the only BAD album. i only graded it 2 stars because some songs like futureal and the clansman make it listenable. anyway, i RERELY listen to it because i have those two songs live with bruce dickinson. if you don't know iron maiden yet, don't buy this one. if you are starting to know iron maiden, and intend to have all albums, buy this one as the last."
3,When it's good...it's GREAT...when it's bad..it SUCKS!,"This CD offers the listener a menagerie of opinions throughout all the tracks. It starts out good with Futureal and a really great song called The Angel and The Gambler. The other great song on this CD is The Clansmen. Unfortunately, the rest of the songs are equally as bad as the previous songs were good! Blaze Bayley was so uneven on this CD, it make me wonder if he had voice problems? With a mix of good songs and bad, this can only be given an average rating of 3 stars. COME ON GUYS! UP THE IRONS!"
1,THE WORST,"Let me be clear: this the worst IRON MAIDEN album ever. The situation reached a point where the band had to hire Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith again. Simple as that. They fired only Blaze, but I think Janick should have been gone too."
1,VIRTUAL GARBAGE,"THis Cd defis any explanation. How Harris and Murray allowed this to happen ? An uninspired singer, uninspired compositions, flat sound, the ridiculous ""Angel and The Gambler "" ( ten-minutes long repeating the same chorus .... , well, I'm out of words. Don't buy it."
3,Burnt with Blaze!,"This is not the Maiden we would like to listen! Blaze is not a good singer.He has good and awful moments but,unfortunately,the awful moments are the majority! Besides,this albun has some songs wich are to repetitive(like the angel and the gambler)!Blaze repeats over and over the same words for a long time! Maiden had to change the style of their songs,otherwise would be impossible to keep Blaze in the band.They insisted on Blaze,now Bruce is back!"
4,Unique off the beaten path Italian cuisine,"I purchased this book to learn different Italian dishes. I wanted unique recipes that bring flavor and interest to the table. This book brings that to the table! I can say that I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the historical aspects(small tidbits) of the dishes. I enjoy a bit of background when cooking. She gives through instructions. I like to use vegetables in unique ways, the front cover is a fine example; Pasta with beets. (I love beets!), several other recipes use fava beans, leeks, fennel. Items I purchase regularly. Definite win for me! Purchased from amazon deal for less than 5-!!"
5,We love this book,This is a great book. My daughter has had it for over a year now and she still loves it.
5,Family favourite,"My brothers and I had this book when we were children, and we got a copy for my three year old niece who loves it. It's a real classic, and a 'learn to read book', meaning that simple words are chosen so that children interested in them are able to recognize how they are formed. The characters are charming and playful.Sam, the owl, heads out at night looking for someone to play with. Everyone's asleep in the darkness - but what is that mysterious light making shapes? It's Gus the firefly! Between the two of them, they get up to some tricks with Gus' light.Highly recommended."
5,Sam and the Firefly - Review,This book deminstrates the extremes of good and bad in one of the main characters mischief. It shows that you can take a tool and use it for good or bad.
5,My favorite artwork,"I had this book as a child. It still has my favorite artwork of any of the children's books. The picture of the sleeping world, the hot dog stand, the approaching train with the truck stuck on the tracks are all etched in memory.Eastman was a formidable children's author. His illustrations for Go Dog Go! and A Fish Out of Water were both marvelous too. And the junked car in Are You My Mother - way spooky, you understand why little bird ran away."
1,It kept ruining my internet connection,"I downloaded it from Amazon and from the beginning I had problems. I had windows 2000 at the time. Well I downloaded it and immediatly it destroyed my connection and couldn't get back on the internet for weeks. I removed it and was done with it. Well I upgraded to Windows XP and I tried downloading again but with a different type of internet connection. Well first off it is really hard to figure out, so someone who isn't technically savvy would have a really hard time deciding how to set everything at. And if I were to leave my computer sit just for a couple of minutes I would be thrown offline (this was due to Zero ads because when I removed it, I didn't have the problem anymore). Plus it didn't even block the ads it was awful, don't waste your time and money. I'm still searching for something that actually works and I haven't been able to find anything."
5,Best historical and travel book I've purchased yet,"As a total history nerd when I travel, this was a phenomenal book to take with me to Greece. It discusses the history and the modern-day layout of every site mentioned in the Bible that is in Greece or Turkey. I especially appreciated it in Athens."
4,Planning travel,"I have just received this a short time ago. I have looked it over and it looks very good, but have not had time to study. I will be using it to plan a trip for the Steps of Paul tour in Turkey and Greece in this coming April."
1,indira ghandi,I would like to know more enformation about indira ghandi. because ihave to my web page that's why
2,Hoped for a bit more depth of field,"While this product is very affordable, it magnifies only about a third of the image and blurs the rest. You also have to move around to find the part you want, and then stay steady to capture it. This can be a bit frustrating if your taking multiple images in a flower conservatory with lots of people. Your eyes will get buggy. I think it helps to shoot with a soft focus flash to bring out detail, and in RAW, of course. Even still, with the image I posted (red leaf with water drops), I wasn't completely satisfied even after some tweaking in Lightroom 4 and Color Efex Pro. It might be a good practice macro lens for some, but if you want quality, go far the better attachment."
2,Don't bother.,"Very difficult to use. Have to focus manually more often than not. Comes with no instructions whatsoever. It is cheap, but still not worth it."
4,Great if you go in with low expectations.,"I had really low expectations from this lens. For the price I found it to be quite good. Better than I expected. I am not a photographer at all. In fact, I consider myself a complete novice. Auto focus doesn't work with this lens, but on manual focus it was still fairly easy to use. I have clicked a few flowers and a wine glass with wine in it.It was fun. I don't regret the purchase. Perfect for a newbie to practice with and can't beat the price."
5,MACRO LENS,I am very please with my Opteka Macro Lens. I am abel to get the close up shots that I am wanting to get without the Macro. It is all in your equipment and your eye. This product really helps.
4,10x macro lens,not a highly used lens but with some time and patients i learned how to use it. pictures that were taken with it came out good and the glass is of good quality
4,Levitt's Life Story,"This book is mostly about Levitt's life story. There's not a whole lot of stuff you can learn by reading this book. It mostly says the same things other books say.... know what you buy, research what you buy, etc.However, there are 2 chapters in the book that were really good. One tells you how the ECN system works and the other one tells you what to look for and how to read financial statements. I would buy the book for these two chapters alone. The book is fairly cheap anyways. There's also a chapter about 401Ks that may interest those that haven't given much thought to retirement funds.Most of the book is about Levitt's life story. He bashes both Republicans and Democrats for obstructing the regular joe (or jane) investor. His life story is interesting but that's not the reason I bought the book."
1,Terrible customer service.,"With 1 month to go I lost my phone Verizon made me pay for an early termination 200.00 when all I would have to do is pay 39.99 for the last month of my contract. Watch out Verizon has terrible customer, service I was lied to and thgen billed."
2,For Fortran programmers who want to learn C++,"This book was written for scientific programmers who program mainly in Fortran but who want to move into C++. It is a brief and elementary discussion of C++. The main features of C++ that make it different than C are not discussed until Chapter 17, and then only briefly. No discussion is given in the book on performance issues in C++ vs Fortran. Serious scientific programmers in Fortran have to face up to these issues and be convinced that C++ is the way to go if they are to make the switch. The book might be useful to those who want a quick look at C++."
2,A Celebration of Olives,I have enjoyed Carol Drinkwater's well written memoirs and incredibly honest revelation of her journey and heartbreak. What really annoyed me was the re-release of previous novels under a new name. I purchased what I thought was a new book only to find it is a rebranded compendium of her previous first two books. That surely is misadvertising!
3,"I bought this CD for ""Giant Steps""","Camilo's ""Giant Steps"" is one of the best jazz tunes anyone has ever cooked up. Some of the other tunes on the CD are disappointing, however. I agree with other reviews here-- most tunes don't match up to Camilo's earlier trio work. I find a considerable amount of rhythmic disparity between the three musicians."
3,Bring back Hernandez!,"I love Triangulo and Live at the Blue Note, but this album is lame. Who is this Dafnis Prieto guy? Is he playing with feather dusters? As much as I love Camilo's keywork, this album proves one thing to me- the trio is boring without Hernandez behind the drum kit. His dynamic, rhythmic style is very sorely missed on this album."
1,A waste of money,"Think very hard before buying this machine. We bought it with the hope it might actually cool down a room, or at least keep a room comfortable, but alas nothing of the sort was achieved. Instead we are left with a frightfully noisy and large thing that fails simply does not work.It is besides a very poorly engineered machine, demanding that one spends half an hour at a time just adding or subtracting one of the hoses depending on how hot it is outside. And then one is left to refit it to the window, which cannot be done without copious amounts of unsightly gaffer tape. The instruction guide is so idiotically conceived as to explain, with an entire page of the booklet, how to fit batteries into the remote, yet not a word was written on how to connect any of the hoses, nor how to adjust the vent.It should be a crime that such a machine be allowed to be sold. Do yourself a favor and buy something, anything, else."
3,Just for JACT,"This book, while a handy and concise book, is by no means to be used as a source for anything other than JACT's publications, most notably ""Reading Greek: Text"" and ""World of Heroes,"" featuring the ""Vocabulary to be Learnt"" from each."
5,Great Box Set,"The 77's were never better than on these three discs. If you can get 'em, I suggest you do so!!Bret[...]"
2,Early Wynton Kelly,"This collection of Hal Singer tunes (the first issued under his own name), is somehow to me worth having out of two reasons: First and foremost because this includes four tracks (maybe some more)that is also early Wynton Kelly-recordings. The other reason - i then think in listening terms - must be that this is another one of those boogie/soul/R&B-albums that became so popular in the late 40's and early 50's. If you are a fan of ""mature"" Earl Bostic, Slim Gaillard, Louis Jordan, Big Moose Walker and such, this is the line Hal Singer is following, allthough i personally (without beeing a great listening fan to neither)think the previous mentioned are more interesting. The last material in the collection, from 1951, is flirting with plain rock'n'roll."
4,Fun car rides!,"Got this for my husband who has rather long car rides to and from work. We await his return in the evening for him to tell us jokes. Fun! Myself I find the language a little unclear, but all together a toppper."
2,Best Book Ever,"This book was written by my father-in-law more than 100 years ago. He was a 1st Lt. in the U.S.Cavalry, serving in the Philippine Islands. It was written for the Army, and considered the finest book ever written on the subject of horses and horsemanship. It was recently re-published by the Long Rider's Guild in England. The Guild is composed of riders who have made a 1,000 mile journey on horseback. They believe it to be the best book written on horses and horsemanship."
4,Terraplanes album Black & White....,"As I am a great admirer of the group Thunder, I finally got my hands on half of the groups former band Terraplanes record. When I listened to this record I found out that it is a great record, and also a great mix between ballads & rock. It is no problem to hear that Terraplane & Thunder is the same style and for all who like Thunder this album is a must."
4,School Book,"This book is our Science Book at my school. It talks about, Sponges, Cnidarians, Worms, and Mollusks in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 it talks about, Arthropods and Echinoderms. In Chapter 3 it talks about, Fishes and Amphibians. In Chapter 4 it talks about Reptiles and Birds. Last, in Chapter 5 it talks about Mammals. I only am up to Chapter 3 in school. The only reason I rated this book 4 stars was because, I find almost all my homework answers in there, and because this book is not the book I would read on my own free reading time. I think this book is almost perfect if your doing a project or report on, sponges, cnidarians, worms, mollusks, arthropods, echinoderms, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and/or mammals."
5,Excellent reading,I loved the behind the scenes take on the Christmas story which all the while presented the gospel of Jesus Christ powerfully. I gave each of my English as a second language students a copy for their Christmas present. Reading it together working through the vocabulary and pronunciations inspired many questions about the message itself! They loved it! Me too!
2,Don't buy this book,"All this book is doing is trying to convert people. It's not really a good story. Don't fall for the ""angel"" part of it. It basically is another attempt from the religious right to sucker you in. I allowed it to happen. But don't you. There are better angel books out there with no strings attached."
1,Cute box...,"The game itself, isn't that great. While the concept is good, reaching into a bag and trying to feel for an animal that matches your card, the pieces are all pretty much shaped the same. It's very difficult for even my spouse and I to differentiate between the animals.There are much better games that go along the same concept."
1,It Doesn't Work,"The book seems well writen and I was really enjoying it until page 120. That's when the included CD is first called for use. I find that anything in LightWave format is not seen by my computer - a new Mac G4, duel processor with OSX 10.2.4. I was careful to read before ordering the book if Mac is supported. They say it is. I'll try it tomorrow on my PC, but my graphics machine is the Mac. If I can straighten this out I think I will highly rate the book. If not, well then I'll stick with no or one star!This book doesn't explain it all. That takes more than 350 pages. It seems to skim the surface, and there's lots of surface to be skimmed! This is a four or five book program. The included program manual is very complete, but such a dry read you won't believe. Kinda like the early Photoshop manuals."
4,good kid's book with life lesson,"This book offers a fanciful tale, accompanied by a life lesson in the reaction of others to our lies."
1,Bad Customer Service,I ordered (and paid for) this item over two weeks ago. I have been trying to get in touch with the third party who sells this item since. I finally was able to speak to them and they indicated that they would not be able to deliver the item until late August. I would not recommend purchasing any items sold by this merchant
1,"Cool idea, but it just doesn't work","I was so excited when my son got this Chalk Tracker car for Christmas. It seems like such a neat idea. After making sure we followed directions to the t, trying the car on multiple sufaces with every color chalk possible and multiple sets of new batteries, I came to the realization that this thing just plain does not work. It runs alright, but doesn't follow the chalk line, not even close. We are returning ours tomorrow. My advice to you, don't bother purchasing one and if you received one for a gift, just return it."
2,Cheesy take on if Elvis had lived.,"Imagine Elvis reforming from his myriad of problems and becoming all sweetness and light. That's what you get with this book. Frankly, I'll take the real Elvis, with all his talent and flaws, before I'd take this ""Leave It To Beaver"" like version. Save your money."
1,Not another Elvis book.........puleez...,"I feel so sorry for Elvis, as it seems that any two bit hack who wants to make a name for themselves attaches themselves to his name. I read this book, and the premise is not to be believed, especially for the true student of Elvisology. Elvis reforming? Conflicts with every known account of the man there is. This is a fairy tale, with Elvis' name attached to it. There is no editing, mispellings are rampant, and get this, there is another book yet to come. A classic case of a struggling author trying to make something of themselves by attaching themselves to the Presley name. Don't bother."
2,one night by debbie macomber,i was very disappointed in this book. i read all of macombers books and this is the first one that really let me down. i think it should have been published by harlequin.
5,one night,"as always, debbie macomber takes you in at the first chapter and entertains you with the relationships"
2,One of her first books,Her writing style has changed for the better over the years. This book was to much like a harliquin book. Give me A Good Yarn anyday.
5,really enjoyable,I really enjoyed reading this book. If anyone else reads this book they will enjoy it to.
5,"""Another Macomber Classic!""","I'm reviewing this book because I think, along with all other Debbie Macomber books, that it is truly a classic love story. It starts off with two radio personalities who can not get along with each other for anything! The opportunity arises for both of them to travel cross-country to attend a convention...together! What a disaster!!! Along the way they share fights, laughs, and in the end, love, proving that even the worst of enemies can get along or in this case, fall in love. I hope you go out and buy this book and add it to your own home library."
2,This book gets crazier by the page,"Of all the Debbie Macomber books that I read, this has to be one of the ones that I was most dissapointed. It starts out as a quite likable story, with two characters who strongly dislike each other but find out that they will be canned by their boss if they don't start to get along. So they put their differences aside and go on a road trip! As they travel together, this book starts to crumble. It starts to get so unbelievable that it's not enjoyable. Had me hooked at first but then I just wanted to hurry up and get the reading over with. Definitely not one of Macomber's best."
5,One Night,"beautifully written, smaller than the other books but that made me finish quicker and go on to Debbie's next book!"
4,Great Holiday Reading,I love Debbie Macombers books and have read nearly all of them . I love her series but found it great just to read a one off that doesnt flow on. It made for a quick and enjoyable quick read. They always have meaning to them and a positive ending thank heavens. I dislike sad endings. It is holidays and on holidays you want nice books to read and this fell into this category for me. I would always recommend her books to anyone who loves getting lost in a book for a while in life and has a feel good to it. Thanks Debbie
4,Enjoyable but not typical storyline for Debbie,I am trying to get to read all of Debbie Macomber's books and wanted to read this early product. I think her later books show she has found her voice and her fans. This seemed so unlike her that I had to keep checking to see if I had the right one. It is interesting to read it just for the purpose of comparison. It had more the romance outline of today that is really explicit. It had lots of twists that were imaginative and I am glad I read it.
4,One Night,"Very cute story, very exciting at times. Here is two people who work at the same company and do not get along!. They end up falling in love under scary and difficult situations!"
4,One Night,"Another fine work of DEBBIE MACOMBER, she is a great author. Her books are always void of bad language. But is still filled with love and laughter, almost to the point that you feel just like one of the characters. I would recommend this book to everyone that loves to read."
3,One NIGHT,Very good..a good read.I enjoyed it as I do with all of Debbies books.I am looking forward to the next Blossom St.
2,Way overpriced,"My almost three year old son loves Caillou, and I was excited to find some merchandise, as it is not in most stores. I chose this game because of it's simple premise, but I was unprepared for what it actually is - flimsy cardboard discs and a useless piece of felt. My son does like the various pictures of Caillou and his world, and we have talked about them (thus the three stars for the educational value), but for the quality and durability, twenty five dollars plus shipping is WAY too much money. The game did arrive quickly, but I wish it had been more accurately discribed in the information section. I would not recommend this game at this price."
5,MY MOM LOVED THEM,MY MOM LOVED THEM. I never saw them. They delivered them five states over. Great Service!
4,Ouch!,"Both Mom's loved the flowers, however, I didn't know that they would still have thorns in them when they were delivered to them! Otherwise very prompt delivery and beautiful. Just wish the throrns were trimmed!"
1,Not delivered as advertised and dead flowers,I ordered these for mothers day - they arrived Brown and Dead. I paid for a stuffed animal and it never arrived At all.. I would not recommed these items at all. I would not even rate it at a 0 star. Picture show a dozen - 6 came and not stuffed animal.
2,LidiaD,"I ordered these roses for Mothers's Day, and was very dissapointed with what I got. The roses were brown and wilted and some died within two days. I could have gone to Costco and bought their roses, for a fraction of what I spent on these. I don't think I will ever order from them again."
5,GREAT!!!,"I think that Doonesbury, along with Calvin & Hobbes, are probably the best comic strips published!"
4,an other good book John Rechy,a must have for the John Rechy fan. it may take others a little to get in to the book but man once you do get in to it you are hooked.
2,"Good writing, bleak novel","While I can see the talent in the author, I can't help seeing this as a prime example of ""gay ghetto"" writing. The subject matter is anonymous sex-and believe me, there is plenty of it in this book. Maybe older gay men might be able to find something or someone in here to relate to but I couldn't. I grew up with the AIDS epidemic and found this book scary and very depressing. I didn't like any of the characters but it did educate me about the low life type of people out there. I read this but could have spent my time better doing something more cheerful."
2,For older gay men only,Any gay person born after 1970 will find this one to be weird. Everyone is having sex with everyone else in this book and there is no AIDS to worry about when the book was written. I couldn't relate. No one seems happy with themselves. Some hot sex scenes but the story might as well be science fiction since no one can live like that anymore.
3,Nice but Received Damaged,This toilet seat cover is comfy and attractive. Unfortunately it had not been packed well so I received it with two permanent creases in the lid covering material that won't go away. Since return shipping was very expensive relative to the cost of the item (and the seat is basically functional) I didn't bother returning it. However I wouldn't order from this company again.
5,Arrgh...you better read this,"I loved this swashbuckler. It had all the adventure, suspense and dueling I could handle. Hope I find more like it,"
1,propet women's oxford white,The right shoe hurts my foot. I would like to return this item. Would you please tell me how. The right shoe is very uncomfortable. It also it not the same width as the left. It hurts the bottom of my big toe. The bottom rim digs into the bottom of my foot. Extremely dissatisfied. Diane Howard
1,"Works great, but why would anyone buy this?","This is a great product, and having the steeping basket in the pitcher is a good safety feature since any leaks from the tea maker will be water and not tea, thus eliminating the risk of stains on your counter/floor. But you can replace a two quart iced tea maker for what this costs (and frequently less on sale), so buying this part makes no sense."
2,"Thin steel, inside not smooth.","The steel is thin. There was a small dent in the bottom, it might have been manufacturing or shipping. The inside surface is not smooth like the outside, there are very fine metalworking ridges.The bowls at retail box stores seem to be equivalent or slightly better. It is made in India.I returned it."
3,Should have shopped around more!,"I had a gift request at Christmas time for this type of bowl. Since I live in a rural area, Amazon was convenient. The bowl is VERY nice and I was in a hurry to wrap up my to do list. I should have shopped around more because after I ordered it, I found several much less expensive - even more than half the cost (Sam's Club)! :("
5,Good Economic Kitchen Solution,"Other buyers commented on a certain ""flimsiness"" in this bowl, but it's the perfect solution for my kitchen needs. Having worked in professional kitchens before, I know there are sturdier bowls out there, but for the price this fits the bill. I only make gigantic recipes once in a while, and this is big enough to accommodate double batches or space-intensive mixing techniques. I think the lighter weight is actually a good thing, and it hasn't dented yet. It lives in the oven when I'm not using it."
4,good quality,"This is nice and deep for most any use, from cooking to wine/beer making, to potting soil mixing for the garden"
3,Not Satisfied,"This would be a fantastic mixing bowl, except for the fact that it was dented inside and had scratches all over the outside when I received it. The construction is sturdy and the bowl has a very large capacity with high sides. Unfortunately I wasn't looking for such a large bowl (the measurements in the product description were incorrect). I am returning the bowl. After all, I expected to get a bowl that wasn't scratched all over!"
1,Item lost in limbo.....,"Rec'd notification that item was shipped and was to be rec'd 12.11.12. As of 12.18.12, still not arrived. Inquired as to whereabouts on 12.16.12. Still no response as of 9pm on 12.18.12."
4,good color,It is a great color. Stay long and easy to mix. no skin irritation or rashes. I really love it
4,VERY PRETTY HAIRCOLOR!,Very pretty haircolor and my hair stayed soft and shiny after coloring. After I shampooed my hair a few times the purple color came out more and more. I will definately buy this product again.
5,hair product,This is an excellent product which I discovered in the US. I have brought many to keep me going.
2,NOT for the serious anatomy/medical student,"This book is NOT for the serious student of anatomy. If you are a medical student/anatomy major who is trying to learn the origins and insertions of the different muscle groups, or which nerves serve which muscle group, this book is not for you. If you are someone who has a passing interest in anatomy and/or you know your anatomy exam will consist of identifying and/or labeling structures on a piece of paper, this book is for you. The interactive CD disc allows you to rotate 3-D models of various structures and progressively ""dissect"" them with a mouse click, down to the blood supply or smallest bone. This book will be interesting as a reference guide if you have cause to explain or show different structures to lay-people, but other than that, it is not very useful."
1,Missing body parts,"It is astounding that a book claiming to be ""anatomically correct"" would show incomplete male genitalia. Where is the foreskin? This movable, self-lubricating portion has the highest concentration of nerve endings in the penis. Over 80% of the world's males have an intact penis - to show an altered organ as though it were normal is an affront to biology."
1,Anatomically Correct?,"It is amazing that a book claiming to be anatomically correct would show incomplete male genitalia. Where is the prepuce? An intact adult has a movable prepuce, this self-lubricating portion has the highest concentration of nerve endings in the penis. Over 80% of the world's males have an intact penis, to show an altered organ as though it were normal is an affront to biology. This is not precise, what message does this send to intact men?"
1,extremely poor representation of male anatomy,"Is it accurate to depict men's genitals minus the foreskin and to completely overlook any reference to foreskin in the book (including the index)? Considering 80% + of the men and boys of the world have a foreskin and more specifically 65% + of the men and boys in the United States have a foreskin, this renders this book's depiction of the circumcised penis a completely inaccurate accounting of the male anatomy.That you would attempt to portray the circumcised penis in your book as natural and whole is an affront to all people who value giving men and boys a CHOICE to determine the fate of their own bodies and a CHANCE to enjoy all of the benefits that remaining INTACT can offer them and their future partners."
4,Ying Quartet has the Zing,Having just read the Tchaikovsky life story again I realized that I didnt have a recording of the String Quartets. The Ying Quartet certainly play Tchaikovsky with the required Russian heart felt zeal and zing and to have the Souvenir de Florence on the dics is an added bonus. This is a very enjoyable 2 CD set. Charles Fleetwood Dip Mus Brisbane Queensland Australia.
5,Excellent!,"This book is a must have for first year nursing students. It provides the reader with more than 1,200 multiple choice questions and the rationale behind the correct/incorrect responses. The questions prepare you for nursing school exams as well as the NCLEX. I used this book myself throughout my first semester of Nursing School and recommend it to all new students!"
5,A MUST have for first year nursing students!,"If you are a first year student do not spend another minute without this book! In order to do well you MUST be familiar with the style of questions and the rationals for both right and wrong answers. This book has it all! Each chapter focuses on a different subject (Hygeine, Asepsis, Law and Ethics, Safety, Mobility, Nursing Process, Etc...) and there are approximately 50 questions each chapter. GET THIS BOOK!"
1,Not great,I watched this with 4 year old who is in to Tom and Jerry right now. This had a hard time hold either of our attention..not the classic Tom and Jerry.
2,Not a fan of new cartoons,"I like the old cartoons. no matter which cartoon it is, it seems as if the older ones are better made, better story etc"
4,Another winner from Tom & Jerry,"I have my grandchildren every other week for a Movie Night. They ALWAYS choose Tom & Jerry. I don't know why, but children ages 3-7 love Tom & Jerry. They will watch it over and over and laugh out loud every single time. It's not educational by any means, but at it's not scary or gory.. so for an occaisional fun movie for them, it's a winner."
5,very good,"My children have been watching this movie several times. They really love it. No violence, lots of action."
5,Tom & Jerry- the best!,My grandkids all love the Tom and Jerry cartoons and movies. They are action filled and show who is your true friend in the end! I watched them and now my 3rd generation is watching them!
3,Tom & Jerry : The Fast and the Furry,This was disappointing! It is not your traditional Tom and Jerry. My grandkids watched it but did not like it as well as The Magic Ring!
5,Son loved,My 4 years old has passion for racing cars and Tom and Jerry. I totally recommend this carton. It is really fun even for the adults.
5,Tom and Jerry DVD review,"What can I say? It's a perfect, good ol' classic, great for kids and adults alike! You can't say that for many modern cartoons nowadays..."
4,Another great album from a great band,"A Blessing and a Curse has to be the most concise DBT CD yet, and while folks like me would like a little more quantity, the quality rises throughout. Feb. 14, Gravity's Gone, Easy on Yourself, Little Bonnie, Space City, and World of Hurt are all outstanding. My only complaint is that I would've liked to hear more from Cooley and Isbell on this album, but Cooley proves to be the man on his two songs. Not quite as good as Decoration Day or Dirty South, but still a great CD."
2,"Love the band, not the record.","Gotta go with the folks who are DBT fans but think they missed a step on this one. Yeah, ""February 14"" and ""Gravity's Gone"" are good tracks, but other than that it's pretty forgettable. I'm especially bummed by Jason Isbell's tunes - what the heck happened? The tracks he wrote for ""Dirty South"" and ""Decoration Day"" were far and away the best songs on amazing records. Now he sounds like a Doobie Brother or something equally silly.C'mon guys, get it together!"
2,Don't buy this album!,"The drive by truckers sealed the deal that they were the best rock band in the world when ""the dirty south"" was released. After listening to this album i'm not so sure anymore. ""A blessing and a curse"" is the worst album the truckers have ever put out. It's obvious that this was written for the radio, and not for the fans. If you want to listen to the DBT, buy ""the dirty south"", ""decoration day"", or ""southern rock opera""."
2,Lacking,"LAcks the the energy, emotion, and imagery of there last few albums. Dirty South and Southern Rock Opera were both five star albums that blendedpsychobilly with southern rock; both of those albums a had a message. This is nothing but a wast of $13.00."
2,What Happened?,I seems after 3 amazing albums the Drive-By Truckers have finally taken a wrong turn. This album seems castorated and weak compared to their older stuff. Maybe it's the line-up change? Do I smell Yoko?
3,"Great band, only so-so album","This album is not nearly as strong as the three that came before it, but it is still pretty solid. I agree with the reviewer before me in regards to Jason Isbell: what was he thinking with these songs? Compared to the classics he contributed to the last two albums, his additions to this album are pretty lame. I can only guess he is planning a solo album and saving his good stuff for that. Mike Cooley has slowly become the best songwriter in the group, and his two songs on this disc rank with its best material. Again, not a bad album, but by DDT standards, it's pretty forgettable."
5,Drive by Truckers,Ordered this for my daughters and they loved it. Will provide many hours of entertainment. It is definitely worth the money.
5,What???,"I don't get these other reviews. This disc if beautiful, deep, and clearly fits into the direction that the band is heading. There are several poignant songs (check out Gravity's Gone, Goodbye, Daylight, and ESPECIALLY Little Bonnie). To say that these are poorly written songs is unbelievable.DBT continues to look at real life situations straight in the eye, and lay all of the emotional cards on the table.Clunkers on this disc? There may be a couple- I don't like Track #1.... And if you like the really hard stuff (Sink Hole, Careless, Lookout Mtn), you might be put off- it might be a bit mellower than what you're used to.Overall, though, just another masterpiece from the boys from Alabama."
5,Baby does not cry anymore!!!,"This is the best car seat for my 7 mo old & 19 lbs baby boy who was crying evey time he was in his infant seat. For the last month my boy has not been even once upset getting in this convertible car seat Britax Roundbound, maze color looks so nice. He looks so confortable and loves watching out the window, just love to see him happy!! I was inclined to buy the Marathon but the reviews were sayng the crotch latch runs shorter than Roundbound so i decided to buy this one & i love it so does my baby :-) wish i bought it earlier. Thank you Amazon & Britax!!"
5,Best seat out there,"We have two of these seats--one in each car. Yes, they are a bit more expensive but 1) SAFETY is great and 2) they are so easy to get children buckled intoWill continue to buy Britax products. Very pleased."
5,Worth the price!,"Having previously had a rear facing childseat, using the Britax Roundabout was a breeze. Installing seat was easy, especially since we use the clips in our vehicle rather than a seat belt. The push button hooks make securing and releasing a snap, rather than having to fight with the old style clips without push-button release. We only use the seat forward facing, but I think the seat would also do well rear facing. I wouldn't say our daughter loves the seat, but she tolerates it much more than her old one. The seat sits her up much more upright than others. Some may be hesitant to purchase due to the price, but this seat is worth the money."
4,Very Good Product,"It is a good car seat and I do recommend it, but I didn't feel it was necessarily superior to some others. Little things like the velcro on the side to hold the belts as the child is being seated shows some thoughtfulness in design, I haven't had any twisting of the belt yet (I've had it for 2 months now), and it's easy to buckle and unbuckle. The good news is that if you land on this product, you don't really need to search further, unless of course you have specific requirements. Good luck."
5,Comfortable and Sturdy!,This looks and feels like a comfortable and solid carseat. Read all the reviews on Consumer Reports...This is well worth the price!
4,Good Seat,"I purchased this about a month ago when my son began to out grow his infant seat. I installed it pretty easily, but couldn't use the LATCH because they were not long enough to reach the rings in my car (Explorer). I have used it in several rental cars and they have reached, although tightening them was pretty difficult. Securing the seat with the seat belt works fine though. My son seems pretty cofortable in it and it is easier to get him in and out of this than it was his infant seat. You just need to make sure it is at a 45 degree angle, or your baby's chin will be in his/her chest when he/she falls asleep. I can't tell you anything wrong with it, but there is nothing outstanding either...hence the 4 stars. I like it."
5,Highly recommended by Mimi and Papa,"I bought the Britax Roundabout a week ago for grandbaby's first birthday. Took about a minute to install in Mom's car, I can't say enough good things about their innovative LATCH belt attachments. The velcro to hold the straps off to the side is great, baby seems to love riding in her new seat. By the time she outgrows this, she'll be big enough for the integrated safety seats in Mom's van. Papa was so impressed with the seat features that he ""suggested"" Mimi buy one for her own vehicle! I haven't found anything that I don't like about this seat, no other seat compares to the ease of use and fantastic features. If you're considering this seat, go for it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,Finally a Lifesaver!,I researched over and over on the internet and everywhere else for the perfect car seat and after reading all the great reviews on this Britax Roundabout I wasted not another minute and ordered it right away. Of course I was nervous if it was just another let down but to my surprise it's Great! The velcro seat belts really help when trying to put baby in car seat. I can actually see out my back window because like all others I tried this one fits in my small chevy aveo perfect. My baby loves it.Thank you Thank you Thank you.Go out and get yourself one of these!
5,hands down best car seat out there,"i searched for months before deciding on which car seat would be safest and most efficient for my son. after reading all the consumer safety recommendations, i found this to be the best one. it is very nice and EXTREMELY safe for my busy little bee. it is also very easy to clean. it says not to put the fabric in the wash, but what toddler doesn't make huge messes in his car seat and get it sticky. you can't vaccuum sticky! so i decided to throw it in the wash on gentle and it came out looking like new! works perfectly fine still after 2 years and i can use it for about another year. for the money it is well worth it compared to cheaper versions who don't have very many safety ratings compared to britax. love it love it love it. my son loves it too! :)"
5,Baby Age rocks!,The car seat is great. We had researched a lot so we knew what we were getting. The best part of the experience was working with babyage.com. They really want to keep thier customers happy and I will be going back for more great baby items. The only thing I wish was different about the car seat is that it had a pocket or pouch on the side like most do for holding sippy cups and toys. All in all a great product and a great company. Thank you for taking care of us Dave.
2,Britax,"Disappointed that the manual was mounted to the seat in a way that made it impossible to read. I had to cut it off just to read it, then where do I put it?"
4,True to word,"While I hope we never have to find out if the car seat ""does its job correctly"", I will say that true to word, it's a) very easy to install and b)the harness straps don't tangle due to the nifty velcro attachments."
5,Definitely made the right choice with this seat,My little guy was getting too long for his infant carrier and would fuss every time I put him in it. Now he has a smile on his face when he gets in his Britax Roundabout seat (the musical mirror helps too)! I drive a sedan (Nissan Maxima) and was frustrated that I couldn't use his infant carrier with the LATCH system in my car because it was too big and had to go in the middle of the back seat. We also had to use pool noodles to get the base level and I was constantly having to readjust. I didn't have any of these problems with the Britax Roundabout. It fits great in my car and is easy to install using the LATCH system. Seems very comfy for my little guy and I love the velcro tabs to keep the straps in place when getting him in and out of the seat. This car seat is definitely worth the investment.
4,Will it fit in my car?,We also chose this seat based on the safety ratings and both friend's and customer reviews. We did find that the requirement to anchor the seat when facing the rear does interfere with our ability to scoot the front passanger seat all the way back in our sedan.It does work for us.
5,Should've gotten this for the first kid,This car seat really does live up to the hype. We just purchased it for our second baby who outgrew his Snugride by six months. We love the fact that the seat is higher than most seats so he can look out the window. We sat his 2 year old sister in it and she loves it too. The seat covers are nice and soft and the colors blend in well with car interiors. There are seats that are OK but this seat does make a difference. Happy riding!
4,Britax Roundabout review,Great car seat. Only issue we have with it is the child can loosen the chest part. I wish someone could invent a part that does not slide easily. But all in all it's a VERY nice car seat. I highly recommend it!
4,Good carseat,"I am not rating it 5 stars as I have only been using it for a month now. I really like the part that it is compact and not too heavy. I was using Eddie Bauer before and that was very heavy and took lot of space in my car. Also, I like the fact that it is easy to remove the seat cover and put it back when you are want to wash it. One minor minus point is that the seat cover is not as soft as the Britax Marathon I had before. I have heard a lot of great things about Britax (Marathon and Roundabout), so I went ahead with this purchase though it is a little expensive. When it comes to the safety of your child, I think a little more money would not matter."
5,Relics etc!,Anything about relics I adore and go about churches looking for them and to venerate. The chapter about the Ark was fascinating. Read this on the way to Medjugorje. THE WHOLE THING!
3,works,"Works, but was unable to keep my notebook from depleting the battery over time. Eventually, could charge the battery in my notebook if it was not running."
2,easy connection?,Looks great and nice case.Everything works and is very easy connectable to the car or plane sockets butthe problem that I have is how to link it up to the power entrance of my Sony Vaio via the USB oulet?Where can i find the cables and plugs for it?Not clear and not explained anywhere
4,as advertised,"this is a great inverter - small, quiet, and powerfulcharges my macbook and iphone at the same time"
3,Short on power....sometimes,"This is the second one of these; the first only showed the red fault light, so the vendor sent me a replacement. This second one only powers SOME items, like my cell phone charger, mp3 player usb charger, two-battery AAA battery charger, and surprisingly a small room-size fan on low; but NOT a 40W or 60W light bulb in a standard table lamp(??), or my Toshiba laptop charger(which may be 200W though)! So if you need a more versatile/reliable inverter, you may want to look elsewhere. It DOES what I need it to do in the car though, so more 3-star than 2-star.....I guess! Oh, I opened the first faulty one that I got and there was a loose capacitor rolling around in it....may take a shot at resoldering that in!"
