5,BRAVO BROADWAY,Really enjoyed the selection done by original cast members. The cassette was in excellent condition and arrived promptly.
4,Good CD,I haven't listened to all of it --- been skipping around to favorites. The ones I heard I like becausethey are done by the cast of the shows and done the way we are used to hearing them.Many songs for a good price. And arrived promptlyShirley
1,Broadway,I like the music very much. However the two discs didn't match with one looking older than the other. Both are in good condition. Wish I had been informed of this before I bought this cd set.
3,Where is ALW,Did the creators of this CD forget about Andrew Lloyd Webber? Gees! Where's Cats? Joseph? Evita? Jesus Christ Superstar? and all those other great musicals he's done????? How can you forget one of the greatest composers of our time? Other wise its a good CD
4,Good Riding Music,"James Carter had this in the limo. If you like other smooth trumpet like Rick Braun, Gordon James or Cindy Bradley, you will enjoy this one."
5,Dare to dream ?,"I read this a few days back. By the time I finished it, I was breathless. Can you dare to dream this big? If you can, Do read this."
5,Dual Gang Low Voltage Mounting Bracket,This is a great item to have when installing your wall plates. Make sure to get these when installing one or two. No other way to install without. Great item.
5,Works as expected.,"Cheap, arrived on time, and easy to install. Used two of these to hide cables in my wall for a ""floating"" Plasma TV look in my liv. room. Total install time, which included cutting two holes into plaster walls, was 20 minutes."
5,Great True House,"This CD is in one word, incredible. If you like real garage, soulful house music this CD is for you. Great tracks, superior mixing make this one you will want to listen to over and over."
1,Insecure,"I know this is off the record and all, but I read this what you call a book and I feel that Gary Rohr is very insecure of his masculinity and needs to show the world how much of a so-called man he is. Personally the book was horribly written and if you ask me if he really cared for his wife and children and might I add, he didn't, he should have never went on those affairs. I can say I met alot of men in my life and alot of them acted very immature, but in Gary Rohr's case its more like he is having a identity crisis and more so living his life then than now. Its almost as if he just really didn't love his wife and simply just settled with, should I say second best. All and all I recommend to anyone that comes across this book, don't waste your time, you would be better off reading a children's book, like ""Harry Potter"", at least you could say that, its worth reading, so if I had a choice to rate the book I would give it a negative 5."
1,Steer clear,"The best advice I can give is to try before you buy. Get a small package from a grocery store so you won't have an entire case of something that's hard to palate.The concept sounded awesome - a crunchy snack made from just plain cheese and spices. The execution, however, is lacking.These are DRY. Perhaps it's the lack of moisture, or maybe it's the salt - but these make you thirsty fast. There is not much barbeque flavor to them - and it seems a bit off from standard BBQ.Now I'm just hoping to find one of my friends or family members to take 11 more packages off my hands so they don't have to be thrown out."
3,Not bad at all,"A vast improvement from the previous book and benefits from being longer and more complex. Fast moving and although nothing new, it is well put together and weaves a number of storylines together effectively. A little rushed at the end but an entertaining book and a lot to suggest that there is even better to come from the Kents."
3,mediocre,"It's a very interesting book that presents some pretty deep ideas... but I didn't really feel anything for it. I found the relationship between the ape and the human to be really unbelieveable, and I kept wishing for her to go back to Adam for some odd reason...haha... I don't think that you were really supposed to feel for Adam... but I did. I guess it's just a matter of opinion."
2,"Intelligent, but distant","I came away from this book with a distinct sense of apathy. It is certainly beautifuly written, elegant, in fact, but it is like a statue...it can be beautiful and very cold at the same time. The ideas about human/animal interaction in the novel were excellent and the characters were intresting, but the experiences presented were by no means fulfilling or emotional. Read it only if you want to feel distant from what you are reading."
3,Not bad for a environmentalist,"In his latest offering, Hoeg takes a stab at contrasting man's love of power with his real place in the eco-system. The result is a mildly sordid & romantic tale with a hugely green ending. Man's world order is ultimately destroyed by his own arrogance and failure to see the warning signs. This is not exactly a new idea is it?Overall, and despite Hoeg's lovely way with words, this isn't up to much. The idea of apes living with humans reminds me of stories of alien replacements in America. Hoeg's apes lack credibility in much the same way."
2,Cold and unpalatable,"Peter Hoeg throws a slew of themes at the reader (addiction, the divide between humans and animals, the nature of intelligence), but the book never really succeeds in engaging the reader. And the sympathy one feels for Erasmus (a well-drawn character) does not make interspecies romance palatable. ""The Woman and the Ape"" provides a lot of fodder for book club chatter, but it is not a pleasurable read."
2,The Strangest Story Ever Told...,"I have to say this was by far weirdest book I've ever read...I have to agree with some on here who say it's satirical and fable-like--it very much reminded me of a fairy tale--a woman in love with an ape, when really we're surrounded by apes who are highly refined and intelligent and we're all living in a farce of a society...? I can't say that it was poorly written--the author obviously can spin a tale from nearly nothing. I'm only giving it 2 stars because I really just didn't like the story and although it wasn't predictable it also wasn't very interesting. At one point I felt like I was reading a really bad soap opera...almost like when One Life to Live had the underground city of Eterna...of topic...anyway honestly if you're looking for a good book and you have limited time--put this one down and find something else."
4,Wry & dry,Each step through the book pushes sensibilities until you either relent to its unexpected humor or declare it worthless.
5,Solid if you're a Georgia fan,"This is a really good book if you want a deep look into Georgia Football history. Stegeman did his homework. I highly recommend this book and ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" for any serious Georgia or SEC enthusiasts."
2,Not worth the time & money,I have been taking this product for a little over a month. 3 times a day is not worth it. They say you should atleast see some fuller breast in atleast 4 weeks. Well my husband and i dont see anything. i should have tryed another product. I brought a 3 month supply so im going to keep using it and see what happens.
1,No results. Period.,"I ordered this product a while ago; I took about 2 months of it and never saw results. I was willing to be patient but started thinking about how this product works. Breast tissue is quite simple - it's made up of fat, milk ducts, and some muscle tissue. Unless this product swells the milk ducts (which would cause unwanted lactation) it increases cellular reproduction. Keep in mind this product is not FDA approved or approved by any reliable source. By unnaturally increasing cellular reproduction you risk the productions of mutated cells a.k.a. cancer cells. I'm not sure about the rest of you ladies but breast cancer is problematic enough - I don't need breast enhancement pills to increase my risks. Maybe it's a stretch but just remember this product has not been proven safe; and according to the bottle, you need to take relatively large amounts to see results. For me, it just wasn't worth it."
1,If it looks too good to be true...,"It probably is. I got these for fun to see if they worked, it seems that they are just full of protein that makes you gain weight everywhere, not just your boobies. :("
1,all the positve reviews are fake,"Look at the other reviews with 4 or 5 stars. Look at the dates. Every one was the first review by the reviewer. And, if there is another review it is very short, while this review is long. Fake. Fake. Fake.This product does not work."
2,so far nothing,I have been taking this for over 3 weeks and so far no change at all. I'm trying to be patient but no difference in size or firmness. I will post more if it does start working though.
1,Dont be fooled,So I have almost finished my first bottle and my breast have not grown a centimeter. The taste is awful too. I would not purchase them again but I bought a 3 month supple so I guess I will wait it out. But everyone is different but never again will I purchase this product. Dont be f00led!!!!
1,Extremely disappointed,"I bought the 3 month supply, and followed the instructions exactly - high protein diet, no caffeine, etc. For the first week, I noticed a bit of tenderness of my breasts, but that went away after a week, and then for the next 2.5 months, absolutely nothing. No results at all. I am disappointed. I am now wishing that I had ordered through the Breast Success website - at least I would have gotten my money back."
2,still waiting for results,"I've started using this product about 3 weeeks and half ago and I have not seen any results yet. I completely quit caffeine like it was sugested, Im gonna keep using it and will post a coment later."
4,Breast Success,"I would reccommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their current breasts. I was hoping to go from a small B to a solid C and I am in my fourth month and have seen an improvement in my breasts. They havnt necessarily gotten bigger, but they have filled out. I gave the product four stars because of the fact I havnt gone up a cup size yet. They have made me firmer and fuller so overall, I am happy with the results. Hopefully a few more months will give the results I am looking for.A note on the change the pills had on my periods... I used to get such bad cramps that I'd be bed ridden for a day each month. Even doctor-prescribed pain killers didnt help with my cramps. Since taking the breast success, I barely have cramps at all. It is rare now that I feel so awful from cramps. Some months, I dont feel ANY cramping! if anything, I'll continue to take the pills just to help with cramping."
5,great product,this product is effective for anyone who wants to enhance. people who take prescription meds may not get results because the herbal content will be blocked. the pills work for me because i dont take any meds or constant over the counter meds. the pills helped me increase by a whole cup size.
1,more info please,"I won't buy any supplement w/out first seeing a complete list of ingredients and hopefully a more developed Product Description, of which this product offers neither. If the product description holds some weight, substantiating the merits of the product, then i next look to see the products' list of ingredients, preferably by being able to view the back of the bottle. Reading the reviews is not enough; at least not in this case, though the comments about the expired dates were certainly disturbing."
1,Didn't work for me,"Personal, this item did not work for me. It may work for other women, but I did not notice any differences after 3 months. I also didn't care for how large the pills were with such a bad aftertaste."
1,"Ludicrous, not because I am not openminded","Apparently, Mikos, the man with whom the author is telepathically communicating with, is more concerned about selling books than speaking the truth. One top of that, Mikos sound like someone who did a lot of research on conspiracy theories and mixed in his own stories to sell books. For example, Mikos believe in the corruption of pharmaceutical companies. I agree. Mikos also thinks 911 was a cry for help from the loving people of the earth because 911 is number we call police. May I remind you Mikos is a spiritually evolved life form who monitors everything that happens on earth with an amino acid computer. Yet, he still thinks 911 was perpetuated by terrorists. I thinks Mikos watch too much CNN. If you want to waste a couple of bucks buying this book, so be it."
2,I don't know about this book,I don't know about this book. Is it healthy or contradictory? It goes on how We of the inner earth are better because we do this. You earth people are a dispair becuase you dont do this and that and we do. And the evergreen pastures and loving beauty of the inner worlds. From the view point of this I havn't read it thouroughly. I do reccommed others on this topic in particular timothy beckley's inner earth. He takes a more objective view point letting you decide for your self furthering your investigations and finding your own path. Also aware of the fact that evil may be posing as good to decieve. I was really hoping to find a female who could expound on these mysteries without the embroidered dross. That would bring together the gap.
2,Inaccurate,"The pedometer is inaccurate. You have to be very careful if traveling in a car/bus/train as it registers all the bumps, but I think most of the cheap ones do that."
3,"Nice compilation, but not great","This is a nice jazz compilation to throw in your multi-disc player, but I have a couple complaints. First of all, the sound quality on the first few tracks on disc one is terrible. I know these tracks were originally recorded in the 1930s, but there is so much hiss and cracking that they are almost unlistenable. It would have been nice if they were cleaned up a bit. Second, there is a problem with all jazz compilations that cover this many styles in that they are disjointed. It makes it a tough listen when you go from Dave Brubeck's ""Take Five"" to Tony Bennett from MTV unplugged all on one disc."
1,"Horrible, completely horrible!","I am a huge Rage Against the Machine fan, id go as far as to say that they are my favorite band and this CD is just a travesty. There is I believe 1 song that i would say was decent but the rest of the album makes me feel sorry for Rage if this is the best that can be organized as a ""tribute"". I didn't expect them to sound exactly like Zach de la Rocha and Tom Morello but I expected something atleast tolerable to listen to. Obviously you don't understand RATM if you make one of their songs sound like a lounge singer preformance. Shortly after buying this CD I promptly threw it out my car window while going down the street, I was that disgusted. I'd give it zero stars if this review would let me."
1,This album makes me wanna spit,"I cant believe that this album can be called a 'Tribute'album. It's the opposite. I would even go as far as saying that this album is a complete (...) take. These bands have crucified every song on the album, and dont deserve to be on it.I suppose I'm trying to tell you that I dont like this album...give me one reason why I should..."
3,All I Gotta Say Is Wow,"[...] there are atleast 4 good songs. Bulls on Parade, People of The Sun, Sleep Now In The Fire and Bullet In The Head. Some songs just plain don't get no respect like Wake Up, that is a real bad atempt to cover that song. Most people should give this CD a chance, sure its not tha best bands but hey! They need a break. [....]"
3,It could be worse,"Alot of people are giving this cd bad reviews and it isnt the greatest cd ever, but I am a huge ratm fan,I mean HUGE and its no that bad. The cd is fun if you want to hear diffrent people playing diffrent versions of good rage songs but its not the best cd ever. All in all it could be worse ...! Buy it if you want to hear a twist on good ratm songs."
1,most regrettable purchase one could make,"I guess they had it coming as part of the ""Renegades"" backlash, huh? Before I get to trashing this waste of studio time, I'll point out the few good points on this cd...Tavu's version of People of The Sun is a riot. Hearing the way that foreign dude sings ""Tobbac-OH, I'm the Marlboro man, Uhh"" cracks me up every time. And Evasl's cover of Bulls On Parade is nice, despite the female vocalist and the fact that the guitarist can't even IMITATE Tom's imitation of a turntable.Other than that, it's the die hard Rage fan's worst nightmare...Only THREE Battle of LA songs? How come no one wanted to cover Down Rodeo or No Shelter? But then, maybe it's for the better that these hacks shied away from such great songs as Tire Me and Maria, considering how badly they destroyed the band's mediocre songs. In fact, they should have only covered Rage's worst, but that would've made for a really short cd..."
3,"its not too bad, you just have to be a die hard rage fan","yes many of the songs sound like drunken coffee shop songs, but the simpicity is what makes it good. sure many of teh songs are not hard at all, but when you listen to it, it makes you want to just pop in a real rage cd (hence tribute). the best song on the cd ""year of the boomerang"" by jenny barry is awesome. i think she should have just done the whole album. she takes a freaking hard rock song and makes it blues. it sounds as if zach was actually writing a blues song. and if youre looking for more of a rage sound listen to killing in the name of. much of the album creates uneasiness for regular rage listeners."
2,Poor Rage,"I'm a BIG rage fan, When i heard about this CD, i ran to the nearest music store to get it. I heard it, and i felt like throwing it out the window. Worse choice of bands ever, where did they get this people from? I could probably made a better one. I say that if they were going to make a tribute CD to RATM, they should of made a Dope one, because that's what they where."
1,Shock as Rage are disgraced!!!,"Lets cut to the chase here. This is rubbish. I wasn't expecting anything as good as Rage, but this really does frighten me. How can these peole be allowed to get away with this? They all sing like they dont really like Rage and play like they hate them. Im all up for new ideas and a fresh approach, but most of these songs, no, all of these songs, sound terrible. The worst moment has to be 'Sleep Now In The Fire', where a man with a whiny voice sings the words in one note and strums his guitar like he was born yesterday.To those people who are in any way interested, listen to the clips and take it no further, cos this is robbery. Spend your money on something more interesting like loads of boxs of tissues and then write a strongly worded letter to the record company telling them to refund you."
2,Way Too Early...,Rage Against the Machine has broken up but they disbanded only about a year ago and as a fan I don't like the fact that they already got covered. One day it will come but not right now. It is way too early.
2,what can I say....,"Actually, I can't understand how the price of this record can be as high as it is.. It sounds like the producer of this record just picked up some people from the street and told them to record their version of one rage song each. but if you got enough money to spend on unneccesary stuff, and if you are a true rage-fan as I, then buy it! Definatley! Even though it's not the best record in the world, it's always nice to hear other versions of great songs. Take Atwater's version of Sleep Now In The Fire (Track 5 on the album) for exampel. It's very different from the original (It's like the Bruce Springsteen song The Ghost of Tom Joad.. (a campfire song)) but it's very entertaining to listen to since you know the lyrics... If you know the lyrics, that is... If you don't it's not so entertaining. But as I said, if you have the money and is a fan of Rage against the machine's work: buy it.. definatley..."
1,what a disgrace!,"1 star, it deserves less, ratm arent a country band they r the greatest nu metal band on this earth (well they were) sleep now in the fire, i think this version is so boring that i could sleep through anything, even through this album. If u want a good RATM album get a real one. Ps why isnt vietnow or know your enemy in it! Tom morello is a good friend of mine and he is in shock trying to get over it!"
4,CSI's previous work worth a look,"I sourced this double DVD because I wanted to view earlier work of CSI's William Petersen and Jorja Fox.Food for the Heart was a wonderfully warm movie with a solid ensemble cast. There are enough sub plots existing so as you cannot lable this purely a 'chick flick', but I expect it will primarily rate well with those looking for a family drama with a slice of quirky humour.Kingdom of the Blind is straight forward in story - a mafia based plot with plenty of violence. Petersen does not have a large part, but he makes a strong impression with his limited screentime. I like a gritty drama, and this film is good for the time it was made."
4,I had to have this!,"I am a huge William Petersen and Jorja Fox fan. I run GSRForeverLove.com and I collect everything with these two stars that I can.I admit, I still haven't watched ""Kingdom Of The Blind"" because I've been told by other Billy Petersen fans that even though he looks amazing in the film, it's not a good movie.I have watched ""Food For The Heart"" many times and I love it more each time. The acting is great, the characters are nuts,fun and sweet, and it's got Jorja Fox in it. If you love an oddball romantic comedy, check out ""Food For The Heart"", you won't leave hungry!If you want to see a good Billy Petersen film, check out ""Fear"",""Keep The Change"" or ""Hard Promises"""
1,Message is we should all be Democrats and be saved.,Thurman tries to cover too much theoretical ground and then concludes that he is a Libertarian-not even close to that. His message for success sounds like it was taken from the Democratic party convention platform and this was some unusual great insight. FDR lives. Welfare will save us. Very dissapointing book. Not worth reading.
4,The Road to Enlightenment,"Travelling inward is not an easy task. The road to understanding spirituality and its ""modern"" application has sparked a mass of simplistic, superficial books and the creation of the ""Religion and Spirituality"" genre. Robert Thurman's Inner Revolution challenges us and the confines of the society we live in today by recounting Tibetan Buddhism and its practice and by giving us insight into Tibetan Buddhist history and development, allows us to reach a deeeper understanding of our own spirituality.Cheers to his thoughts and many blessings to the greater being that has allowed this westerner to come into the light."
2,"There's Too Much Out There That's Better,","While this is not as bad as the book of the same name, it is, nonetheless, a fairly missable video.Rigan doesn't do a bad job of explaining the techniques and there are probably some useful details. The problem is that there are just so many videos out there that are much better.The technique is sound and Machado's credentials are impeccable. I just think this foray is just a little too early. His newer stuff is fantastic.He covers basic collar chokes and chokes from the back and variations and does so without a great deal of details and average communication skills.This might have been a good video but for several much better videos on the subject. These include the chokes videos from Renzo/Kukuk and the series from Cesar Gracie"
5,Every Good Photographer Needs One,Excellent to use on a camera or scanner calibration. If you are doing any color management you need to have this as a reference that you can count on. It can often show you how true the color is that your camera is putting out as well given callibration scripts in Photoshop.
2,Gary - Bi-Focal Sunglasses,Functional but NOT fashionable. Bifocal looks very bug-eye; a raised and very obvious bi-focal to anyone looking at you.
2,Rejected Deflector,"Deflector was very difficult to install~!!! Deflector is not aerodynamic. When my truck was in motion the noise that was made was unreal. To return item cost 1/2 the original price(restocking fee + S&H). I strongly recommend saftey gloves while installing, almost needed stiches from the razor sharp edges."
3,All Gunk except Delicatessen...,Worth buying for one track and one track only...Classic Adventure by Delicatessen...Specially recorded for this CD...Check this link for Delicatessen downloads and updates...www.thenationalanthem.netDelicatessen will be releasing new material in 2005
5,Simply Beautiful,"This version of THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ pleases children of all ages. Do not be put off by the length (4 hours) because this re-telling moves swiftly and beautifully. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dorothy), Phyllis Diller (Wicked Witch of the West), Rene Auberjonois (Scarecrow), Nester Serrano (Tin Man) and Robert Guillaume (Lion) and the rest of the cast are perfect in the characterizations. This is the closet version to L. Frank Baum's book you are likely to find anywhere. This album is fully acted with no narration (like a lot of OZ audiobooks). You will enjoy this version many, many times just as the 1939 film."
4,"Soothing, Inspiring Instructor","First and foremost, I love Petra's demeanor. There is a warmth and tranquility about her that makes it very enjoyable working out with her. Elegant Strength is a yoga/dance fusion workout at about the low intermediate level. As a low advanced exerciser, I mainly do the standing leg portion of her workout. I love the beautiful, dancer-like flow of the standing work that challenges my legs in many different ways. Petra's movements never feel rushed and the pacing always feel just right to really be able to fully do the movements and get the most out of them. The production quality is quite nice and the set is especially pleasing to the eye. Petra works with two background exercisers. The 60-minute workout is chaptered so you can play the entire workout or just choose body & breath connection, standing legs/core, standing total body, floor, core and/or stretch."
5,NOTES FOR THE COLLECTOR OF MALE EROTICA,"Refreshing and stunning black/white photography of nude males from the days of the ""physique"" style of erotic male photography. Excellent notes by David Chapman about the life of Fred Kovert, or at least what little we know of it. This great Artist was yet another Martyr to intolerance and hypocrisy. What is remarkable about Kovert's art is the painstaking attention he gave to his models and the way every contour and curve, from head to toe, and everything in between, is captured in detail. Few erotic artists have captured male beauty and power the way Kovert did. I don't hesitate to say that this photobook should be an obligatory addition to your collection."
5,Very underrated CD / Album,This is an underrated album from James Taylor's guitarist. I own it on vinyl. Every track is great. Buy it if you come across it in the cut out bins.
3,The passage of time.....,"Being a huge fan of Kootch's work with James Taylor & Jackson Browne i felt compelled to give this album a try.I have also had his sophomore solo release,Innuendo for some time (originally on vinyl) which i really like.Some 70's albums just don't date,partly based on the quality of the music,but also my biase towards those artists i've followed for years ( JT & JB mentioned previously) This album unfortunately has not stood the test of time so well.Definitely falling into the old R&B; category (as opposed to current R&B; !!! )the overall sound is a little tired & cliched.Still some enjoyable moments & shades of Kootch's capability to write a great song,but he makes a better red hot session guitarist than he does the leader of the band."
2,Easy Listening,"This music would be what you might hear walking through a supermarket. ""The American Journey"" the only tyical Arkenstone song on the album. The rest are best classed as easy listening. I too was hoping for a more adventurous work like ""Return of the Guardian"". The recording quality is excellent and therefore deserves credit.This brings my Arkenstone album collection to 14, and this one would rank 13."
1,Arkenstone Becomes Yanni,"The last few discs by David Arkenstone have been a let-down. Working with his wife Diane, he has watered down his music to the point of sounding like Yanni. The first song of this disc, ""New Day"" is the only keeper of the bunch. I can hear Arkenstone repeating phrases from his old music. This is a real disappointment considering he was once one of my favorite artists in this genre."
4,Solid fundamentals,"I'm a musician and songwriter with a degree and many years' experience. But when I took on a project to create an opera with a playwright friend I found that my theory was rusty -- and I was also venturing into types of composition I'd never done before. I wanted a good solid book that would help me review my long-ago theory classes and layout a framework that would help me structure my composition.The book's been a very pleasant surprise. It's quite intermediate in level. If you're not comfortable with a lot of theory basics, it would be a hard place to start. Similarly, experienced composers looking for inspiration for new directions probably won't find it here (or not enough to make it worthwhile). However, especially for composers with some experience, the book is an valuable way to brush up on theory, begin to apply that theory to examples and exercises and try some new approaches to writing.If that's the type of book you're looking for, I heartily recommend this title."
4,On Composing Music,"This book is full of small exercises for getting the beginnner to start composing. Covers most of the techniques a composer will want to know without giving you a headache. However, the scope of the book doesn't cover where and how to use some of the techniques. Though not methodical toward composing mature pieces, overall the book is highly educational for those with a background of half a year of college piano or theory class. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,"Very fast, not great Mozart.","Robert Levin can play this music very fast. Unfortunately, playing Mozart too fast makes the music sound facile and shallow. In Mozart, more than any other composer, the spaces between the notes are very important.Also, while I admire the clarity which the pianoforte brings to the music, the richness and depth which a Kempff or a Pires can bring to the music are sorely missed. I agree with the reviewer who says this performance reminds him of Glenn Gould's performances of Mozart. Only problem is, while Gould's Bach was great, his Mozart was mechanical.To hear this music at its optimum, get either of Maria Joao Pires' recordings on Denon or DG. The DVD is very informative and entertaining."
1,Not what I expected,"I expected a beach mat that would last a day at the beach. This did not. It took all of 5 minutes to rip and render itself useless... I wish I went somewhere else. Sorry, guys!"
5,A great Book,This book was about a girl selena who didnt realize she had super powers when she visited her cousin jada
2,DISAPPOINTING,The cover looks really cool. And that's the best part. It was frustrating. I was expecting a lot more; it was a good idea. But it turned out terribly. And the ending was ridiculous. They never even explained what powers Shadow Girl had. I don't recommend this one.
2,Shadow review,"This is by far the worst book in the series. No plot, no good descriptions and not one chill or scare in the whole book.I expect better of R. L. Stine in the next book of the series Camp Nowhere."
3,Good until the end,I READ THE OTHER REVIEWS AND I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WOULD REALY BE BORING UNTIL I GOT TO THE END I THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE A GOOD ENDING BUT IT WASN'T
1,BOOOOORRRRRRIIIIINNGGGGG!!!!!!,"I BARELY made it through this book without sleeping.....IT was very tiring, and not in one bit scary. It was actually pretty STUPID. I don't think R.L. Stine put any thought process while writing this one.........I recommend this book for people who want to get bored out of their mind. For a summary, read the book description."
1,Not impressed with this prodcut,"It really doesn't work. Perhaps the ones you buy in a store will, but this one I bought online certainly doesn't. Yes, if you hold it over a bottle of windex that gets it to change color, but in my tank when the ammonia level rises, and is confimed with regular test tube kits, this alerter doesn't change color at all. Would not buy again"
2,Not Accurate,I used this product to help with my fishless cycle. The readings were way off. Its ok to use as a supplement but I wouldn't use it as my only means of ammonia detection.
1,Cheap SH**,"DOES. NOT. WORK.The only time this crappy expensive piece of plastic will detect ammonia is if you hold it over a bottle of ammonia (to test it like it says on the package).If you value your fish, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!I thought I could save some money (since this lasts for a year and test kits won't necessarily) getting this when I saw it at petsmart and protect my fish. BIG MISTAKE. It doesn't work, AT ALL, missed a large ammonia spike and nearly lost all my fish.The idea was nice.The product, sh**."
4,It's not silicone but..,"It's not silicone but it still serves the purpose. It's pretty decent looking and has protected my phone very well with my toddler throwing it about. The case has snapped open just a bit but has never opened completely. It snapped closed with no problem. The case does scratch to reveal some sort of metal beneath, but it's nothing really noticeable. Just thought I'd mention it. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It would have been awesome if it were silicone though."
4,"Yo Yo Ma, Bela Fleck, and Alison Krauss?","I've got them all individually in my collection, but collectively? I had to listen to the CD, then I had to buy it. You've got traditionals from anonymous donors and Foster. You've got some of the finest pickers and strummers around and it's just great stuff.Favorites: James Taylor's rendition of ""Johnny has gone for a soldier"". You'd think I'd tire of this song, I've got a dozen covers of it, but no.""Death by Triple Fiddle"" is a fast-paced fiddle song that'd have you dizzy if you got up and tried to dance, but your foot's going to be tapping and you might as well try!Rebecca Kyle, March 2009"
5,Japanese Festivals Come to Life!,"Vilhar and Anderson, a husband-wife photographer-writer team, have put together a superb book. Through mainly visual images and pithy explanations/picture captions, they have encapsulated Japanese matsuri (festivals). The Japanese have festivals for everything and Vilhar has collected a good mixture: Gion, of course (Kyoto's most famous festival), kites framed by Mt Fuji (for Children's Day), young geisha, etc. Nobody today is doing better work in Japan/on Japan than Vilhar & Anderson. The only ""problem"" with this book is that it was too short. I, for one, would pay more to get more."
5,Water wise gardening,"Wonderful book! Explains the unique characteristics of water-wise plants covered. Includes many plants and photographs as well as descriptions of best growing conditions. I especially liked the section that groups plants by special characteristics-pool-side, for the novice, scented,etc."
2,Extremely disappointing!,"I ordered this book as it was advertised as now also including and clearly identifying frost tolerant plants as well as drought tolerant. I don't know if I've been sent the wrong edition but I can find no references to frost tolerant plants. Living in north eastern Spain where we can get quite severe frosts and hot dry summers this was very important to me. I also found that lots of plants were mentioned in the text but were not included in the ""Plant Selection"" section of the book. Overall extremely disappointing!"
1,Mediterranean gardening a water wise approach,Disappointed with the size and quality of the photos of this reproduction.I'm sure the original book was far superior in every wayWould not recommend.
3,Scent wasnt strong,I was not impressed. The scent level was quite low for this product. Their soap however was quite decent. Just skip the shampoo.
5,Great toy!,"This Pooh toy is large, soft, and fluffy. Our two year old loves it. It met all of my expectations."
3,more details please,It would be helpful to have dimensions of products since I'm looking for a match to other Pooh characters and want them to be in the same size range.
4,Eyes could be improved,"I ordered this bear as a first birthday gift for a granddaughter and on the whole I am pleased with it. I prefer the original Pooh over the Disney cartoon Pooh and for the most part this bear fits the bill. Although the description calls it ""Large"" it is the perfect size for a one-year-old, and the chenille gives it a super cuddle factor. It is a bit squishable (medium soft stuffing, not hard and firm) which should also make hugs lots of fun. The embroidered nose and eyes look like they will remain safely attached. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the eye placement could be improved. It looks fine in profile; however, in head-on view the eyes are a little low, but not so much that they are a deal breaker. Shipping was super fast, very impressive since I did not opt for expedited shipping. It arrived within 2 days."
1,Nothing but trouble,"I think some of the above reviewers will be singing a different song after a few months. I received this vac. as a Christmas gift. Almost immediately the belt broke. After two more belt replacements, the fourth belt melted inside the machine. We managed to clean up that mess and get it working again only to have it go completely dead. Turned it on, loud snap and now nothing. DOA. Gonzo. In addition to these very serious difficulties, the hose attachment does not stay secured in it's ""place"" which means you constantly have to stoop and replace it. This is a two handed maneuver and often the whole thing would topple while I fixed the hose. This happened two or three times EACH time I vacuumed.Sorry to say this vacuum was a huge frustration."
3,"Great Vacuum, but a pain to clean","Like i said, it is a pretty good vacuum, it picks up all the dogs hair and human hair. Only one bad thing is it's so loud and to clean the bucket was a pain!!!"
4,Best Vacuum I've had so far,"I just bought this vac about 2 weeks ago and I must say it cleans the best out of any other vacuum I have ever used. I can even smell the difference in the air (less dusty after vacuuming). For me, the cord isnt long enough, but that may be because I live in a ranch house. I agree with the others about cleaning out the canister, it can get very messy! I try to empy the most of it in the garbage can and then take it outside to tap it out the rest of the way. I havent tried to clean the filter yet. They say you can rinse it out and let it dry...we'll see. The attachment hose isnt really long enough for me to get into the places I need to get too like for dusting the top of the curtains. Overall this vacuum works awesome as far as cleaing goes. Better than any other I have used."
4,Hoover Empower Vacuum,"Have purchased the vacuum and has been satified with it. The only warning to others is: Do not buy this item for the quiet button as it really is not quiet. Sounds like a vacuum. Also the on/off switch does take some getting use to, but this is just a minor adjustment."
3,Pretty Disappointed...,"I bought asked for this specific vacuum cleaner for Christmas for the mere fact of the HUSH feature...bad decision! I have a Kirby for my bottom level and I was wanting something for upstairs, and when I heard about the HUSH feature, I thought that I could clean while my 2 toddlers were sleeping. WRONGO!!!!!!! The commericial was decieving... I'm sure that it cleans as good as any other vacuumes on the rack! I know that it will never add up to the Kirby, but there's virtually no traffic upstairs like there is downstairs. I'm just alittle bummed out! The green is very festive, though!"
2,High maintenance machine,"I bought this machine in April 2004 and the belt broke the during the first use. Since then, I have replaced the belt three more times. I have four cats and a dog and the canister fills up quickly. I am breathing far more dust and dirt while cleaning the filter and emptying the canister than I would with a bagged vacuum.I find that I spend more time maintaining the vacuum, then vacuuming. Also, the attachment hose is not long enough.The good part....when it works, it works incredibly well! I would not recommend this vacuum for anyone with kids or pets."
2,I wouldn't purchase another vacuum like this,"I bought this vacuum after reading the reviews on this site. I wouldn't buy it again. While the vacuum will pick up dirt when the hose is attached, I spend more time reattaching the hose than actually vacuuming. The hose comes off repeatedly to the point where I finally taped it to the vacuum. As far as cleaning, I have three dogs and could probably do a better job of cleaning with a previous 20 year old vacuum. It's not worth the money and definitely not worth the aggravation in reattaching the hose repeatedly while trying to use it."
4,Great Job for the price,"I bought one of these about 8 months ago just to beat up doing the car and it has become my favorite vacuum. My Kirby sits in the closet now. I do have to agree that the hose is too short and I don't care for the bagless thing (it's messy), but it really does a good job for an $80 vacuum."
1,dense,This is a dense and scholarly review ofa topic that lends itself very well tocomputation (cf. other books on the samesubject). Sadly the text is unleavened withillustrative (or even any!) examples to naildown the exposition. Too bad - a real missedopportunity.
4,"They did the job, but....","I bought these candles to try to save money. The group I am with uses a MUCH more expensive candle. When using both candles during an evening event, they were indistinguishable from one another. which was the effect I was hoping for, hence the 4 star rating. However, the candles are shorter than I anticipated and are easily engulfed in the average man's hand. They feel cheap, like a plastic flashlight with a Christmas lights' bulb. As of yet, I don't know if they will last since they will only be used three times a year. For the first time use, they did the job."
5,Very nice appliance timer,We bought two of these timers. Both work exactly as described. If only they made a 120-60-40-20 minute version...
1,Verify that your existing setup has a neutral wire before ordering,"A year ago I replaced a fan switch with one of those dial-timer switches which was very easy to install. I thought this switch looked a lot better and the quiet operation sounded great also so I purchased it. According to the manufacturer's website, most new house's electrical systems include a neutral wire configurations and since my house is one year old it did not occur to me check before ordering. My configuration only has a 3-wire setup and without the neutral wire, the timer won't work. One of my friend's is an electrician so I called him and he said that generally only timers for HVAC systems in residential building have a neutral wire setup. So before you order, verify that your existing setup has a neutral wire, because it probably does not."
5,Must have item for ventilation.,If you have kids or a wife that likes to take long hot showers that steam up the bathroom or leave the toliet room without air freshener the timers allow the moisture or smell ridden air to exit long after you leave without worrying about whether or not you turned off the ventilation fan. The new fans today are so quiet that it is tough to tell if they are on or not.
5,perfect solution in the bathroom,"After years of having the bathroom fan running for hours, even days, the Leviton Preset Minute Electronic Timer solved the problem. No longer do I have to replace or clean the bathroom ceiling fan as often. With the timer, the air is cleaned and the fan shuts off. Great solution. Several people who have come over to the house actually remarked favorably about the fan timer. I am glad I installed it. It was very easy to install and took only 20 minutes."
4,Works great-tight fit..,"Installed 3 of the timers on bathroom exhaust fans today. They all work great, installation was simple. I am an electrician so installation might be a little more of a challenge for your average homeowner. These units REQUIRE A NEUTRAL so check before you order to make sure the neutral is in the box. The units are quite large so they are a tight fit."
3,Not for world-music fans,"If you enjoy contemporary Top 100 pop, I think you'll be happy enough with this CD. It reflects decent mainstream artists with a focus on American and Latin-style radio pop. *But* if you're a fan of world music, be warned that this isn't world music, it's internationalized pop, and it's pretty bland compared to the local flavour that you'd find in other world music collections."
5,A Dog Parent Must,"If you are a dog parent (and not a parent of a child) this is a MUST! This magazine will allow you to keep up on all the fun & exciting outfits and products offered for your fabulous fur baby! If you are a modern dog parent you'll want to subscribe to Modern Dog. Like any good parent magazine - you'll find information needed to care for your fido! The magazine will keep you up to date on modern trends and happening places. Of course, if you're not a true dog parent and have children, you will still love the magazine!!! Enjoy!"
5,"Hard to find on newstand, but great","This mag is difficult to find on the newstand, but is worth subscribing to. It is definitely a fun and enjoyable magazine geared to those of us who are a little nutty over their dogs. It isn't for the dog professional, or breeders, or show people -- but for us average folk who have ""pets"" that they just love.The mag contains good articles, and unlike other magazines -- the advertisements are incredibly useful as well. It is sometimes hard to know what's out there for dogs -- but this magazine's advertisers have a good target audience, and I've seen things here that I'd never have known about otherwise!Recommended!"
2,emmitts granny,"Book is so-so. It doesn't tell you the dogs breed. Photography good. Most celebrities chosen somewhat anonymous to me.Many, many Labs. If you're in love with that breed you'll enjoy the book."
1,Died within a month,"This initially worked, but died within the month (used in a bathroom scale). The original battery had lasted 4 years. Assuming batteries bought from this supplier, or through Amazon in general, are probably older and inventory is not checked for quality control."
1,These batteries Do Not Work!,"These batteries did not work for me. I do believe that they must have been sitting around for some years because they had very little charge to them. Not one worked for more then a few minutes. I had to purchase from another place and they (at the other place) had the expiration date clearly marked on them. They also worked without a hitch. When a battery doesn't work on a product such as 3D glasses, it's more then unfortunate. It's mis-leading and can become fretful. I was concerned that a 150.00 pair of 3D glasses were defective. No battery should be sold without a clearly marked expiration date and without it being tested if they've been left to sit around so long."
5,Sony CR2032 Lithium Ion Battery,"Excellent product, just what I needed when I ordered this item. Batteries were perfect for what I needed for my garage door opener."
3,This battery works,I ordered this battery for a 20 year old wireless bike computer. It arrived in an envelope and works fine.
3,Review,"Very theory oriented. A good chemical engineering textbook (i.e., from Prentice Hall) is probably a better choice for more applications oriented content."
4,Helpful but not an easy read,"The book is good, but it is not organized/formatted well, so it was difficult to follow sometimes. Note that this book is paperback and black and white pages."
4,Good book,"Good book. If you are a rookie in kinetics, maybe this book is not for you. If so, better look for Fogler's. This book adds more things."
4,"Definitely not ""New""","I was recommended this book by several people, and due to the low cost and having an Amazon Prime Membership, I figured it would be worth purchasing. Received the book in 1 day (sweet, right?), and overall the book seems OK. However, the book is obviously not in ""new"" condition, having minor scrapes, bruises, and scratches all over the cover. Material inside the book seems good, however I was hoping for something a bit more graduate-level, and this is definitely and undergraduate level textbook.Overall, great book, and an OK buy. This is what happens when you get a Prime Membership and decide to buy everything from Amazon, not always the best."
1,This is a 2004 Price guide?,How can a book published in 2002 be a 2004 price guide. Give me a break.
4,Works great,"Although these are a bit darker than I expected, they work great. The shower rod and rings we had before always stuck and came off. These slide with no problem and hold secure. I would buy these again."
5,curtain rings,Arrived early and the rings look great with the antique copper. I had no problems with them at all and would purchase again.
1,doen't run on newer systems,Wish I had been made aware that this game would not work on my newer computer. The box looks great....
3,a synopis of the First World War.,"This is a good book for an overview of World War I. Baldwin does an adequate job of reviewing all the theaters of war. Some histories of the war don't cover the Russian, Italian, Bulgarian, and Middle East theaters, but Baldwin gives all equal weight. Thus the reader will have an insight into not only the Western Front, but the politics and battles elsewhere.Baldwin states this is an outline history. This is what the reader will find if he reads this book. No individual stories will appear here, just the outline of the war. Baldwin also limits his own opinion in the book."
4,Creepy!,I used this for a Halloween party I had and it was great! Wonderful scary mood music for Halloween. Reccomended to anyone as background music or especially for parties!
3,its... ok,little too much of that high pitched whine voice in it. not bad to listen to on the treadmill
4,Awaiting the next book,"Bean's Song was a hard book to get into,took awhile but once I got into the middle of the book I couldn't put it down, finished the rest in one setting. Many fun charcters. My favorite part of the book is the illustrations. I enjoyed exploring each picture with all of its details. Book does leave you hanging for the next one. I would recommend this book to any reader of fantasy."
1,"Boston Pops, Arthur Fiedler conductor","This without a doubt is the worst of the worst of all the Pops recordings. It is so lame the orchestration so flat. Every song sounds the same. I think my copy of this CD will have to go in the trash, Its not worth the space on my shelf."
1,A lot of RAMBLING.............,"I read the first few pages and could not believe that I have been cheated by the title of the book, as well as the first reviewer. I actually read the first review again and then compared to that at the back of the book and my assumption is that the first reviewer (A reader) is somehow connected to the benefit from this book.If you have read the book then you will understand my subsequent statement. After reading the book I feel exactly like a donkey carrying a load of speeches with no wise content. Too bad I have wasted my money. It is like listening to a hypomanic (mild) patient talking. I thought with more recent congress the author should get better but it is just the same. I lost my patience and threw the book on page 190.Hopefully others will be careful before ordering this item."
3,more isn't always good,"i may not be an expert on the history of sony records, the modern era 23 years worth of music and all they have is this? They should have put out two volumes of the modern era, vol.1 with the classics like Aerosmith, ELO, Journey, etc. and vol.2 with Fiona Apple, New Kids on the Block, I'm sure Sony could have done better. I gave it 3 stars just for the classic groups. And the classics i do not mean Michael Bolton & Wham (Know what i mean?)"
4,This is also a good compilation,"One problems is that a couple of the songs exist only in the castrated version (missing a verse here or a bridge there). One example is ""Just The Way You Are"" (Billy Joel). This is, however, well worth buying secondhand."
2,Where's the Beef?,"All right, he's cute. But I can name 5 recordings of the Mendelssohn (beginning with Menuhin and ending with Hahn) and 5 recordings of the Beethoven (beginning with Hahn and ending with Menuhin) better than this one, so why buy it?It's all about marketing."
4,Compared to St Martin in the Fields,"Well, Joshua Bell can do no wrong in my book. I am glad to have this in addition to the wonderful recording with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. I do in fact find ASMF more eloquent, but this one is great in its own way. Incidentally, for those who couldn't find the ASMF CD here, I found it after hearing it on WCRB in Boston, followed up to their site, and it led me to [...], which had it."
5,Great Recording,"A perfect interpretation of Mendelssohn & Beethoven in my opinion. Flawless too of course, expect nothing else from Joshua Bell. Should definitely make this recording a staple in your recording repertoire."
3,not harmonic..........,Bell plays good but the violin sound is too weak ............The orchestra sounds bad ..NOT HARMONIOUS with soloist...they play each other......
4,"Dry, clean-cut recording and performance","I agree with Jed Distler's editorial review. The dry recording leaves a rather 'in your face' effect which some may like more than others. A useful alternative to more traditional, grander, readings. Time will tell whether I return to this one more often than to, say, Grumiaux with Davis on Philips. A cautious welcome."
3,"A ""pop"" baritone with outstanding technique, verstility and class.","Not really Heino's best. Until I heard Heino I imagined that the USA had a monopoly on producing the rich tonal qualities expected of a top class baritone. This recording of a popular singer of German lieder/folk songs/pop songs will suit all who place natural musical talent and clear diction high on their list of preferences. One may not like ALL the tracks, but you can guarantee at least sufficient to go looking for other Heino records, and THERE ARE MANY. This is a good starter. If you get the opportunity, check out tracks ""Alte Kamaraden"" for the marchers, ""Ich danke dir"" for country/westerners and ""Ach Ich hab in meinem Herzen"" for the balladeers. There's music for everyone!"
3,Another Rip Off,"With four Angelina videos I was eager for more to be released. When this came out I though my wait was over. But when I received my order I realized what had happened. This video contains two stories (not four like the others) and both are in earlier collections.First is The Ballet Tickets from ROSE FAIRY PRINCESS. Angelina will do anything to see her ballet heroes perform. If only she had tickets to the performance.Second is Two Mice in a Boat from ANGELINA IN THE WINGS. Here Angelina must learn how to cooperate with the tough guy Sammy as they are teamed together in the annual boat decoration competition.These are good stories but if you have ROSE FAIRY PRINCESS and ANGELINA IN THE WINGS, you will already have these stories."
4,Angelina the Ballerina DVD,Great introduction to the characters of Angelina the dancing ballet mouse. Very sweet for little ones to watch. My daughter 28 months adored it.
4,Review from The Journal of Legal Medicine,"""Case Studies in Forensic Epidemiology is an important and valuable contribution to the literature in this field. It is an interesting, well organized, and easy to read book that continues Dr. Loue's good work in bridging the gap between the scientific and legal communities. The case studies chosen for this book highlight the impact and importance of this emerging profession to the fields of science, health care, and the law and to the welfare of society more broadly."""
5,Great mix of nature sounds and grooves,"This is the second CD by Ah Nee Mah, both released recently. Both of the CDs are excellent! This one focuses on Native American-inspired music with an edge. There are natural sounds incorporated into the music, which is a combination of acoustic and electronic instrumantation. Ah Nee Mah brings a real groove and an edge to their music, creating a dance-trance environment. The music is really distinctive, and crosses many different borders, appealing to a wide variety of listeners. I guess that the best description is to liken it to ""Sacred Spirits 1"" , or Enigma. I've played several tunes from this CD, and their previous release, ""Ancient Voices"", on a radio program in Alaska, and have received calls from all over the state asking who produced the music and how to get a hold of it. Once you hear the sounds, you will want to get a hold of it as well. Then, after you buy this one, add the first release to your collection, too."
5,good product,Get a real tripod but otherwise all other aspects of the product are an excellent value. I have sold endless watches on eBay and the pictures are a much higher quality with the photography tent.
1,SIB-100 Photo in a box,"Upon opening the box and unpacking the lights I noticed parts missing (they had fallen off). The kit is a good idea but this one is quite cheap, the tripod is useless and will not support a DSLR - I tried and no luck as it would not lock. The components were undersized and cheaply made. The fabric is good, not great but good -- the box is difficult to keep square with the small velcro tabs. The lamps over heat in minutes and take quite a long time to cool down. Your better off looking elsewhere."
1,Buyer Beware,"The idea of this is great. The light box part is fine (although I would prefer a white background to blue and grey) and the package is slick. It's true you get what you pay for though. The lamps start heating up quickly and smell horribly and cannot be turned off without almost burning your hand. There are extensive warning notes all over the instructions about fire...they must know it runs too hot. Also, the 'camera stand' is awkward and worthless. Just use a regular tripod if you need to get this for a cheap, temporary solution."
1,"Dangerous, beware","The whole thing is flimsy and cheap, but the lights are dangerously so. One light refused to work, then somehow started working and smoking. It took 20 minutes to get the burnt plastic smoke smell out of the apartment. Definite fire hazard. Definite health hazard from the plastic fumes. Not worth $6, let alone $60.Also the tripod is useless for any but a tiny camera. I would recommend you get a decent tripod (even the $20 tripods are better), then take a trip to Ikea and buy a few halogen desk lamps. Or, spend the bucks and get something better.If you do buy this, for pity's sake DO NOT LEAVE THE LIGHTS UNATTENDED, you risk starting a fire.Time to test the returns policy...ADDENDUM: Adorama was great in dealing with the return. So while I still think the product is substandard and even dangerous, the vendor is terrific."
2,Not powerful enough,"I make jewelry and wanted a home lighting system to take pictures of my pieces. The bulbs get very hot and smell but they don't seem to be powerful enough to shed enough light on objects inside the box. One of the bulbs started sparking the first time I used it. The camera stand isn't as stable as it looks, either. You really need a tripod to do this kind of work. I'm going to get better bulbs and use my own tripod but keep the light box and try again."
4,Photo Studio-in-a-Box,This is a nice compact unit which allows easy photographing of small items. It could be 5 stars with the addition of an instruction booklet which includes tips on getting better photos.
3,A good box for the price but with some flaws,"This is a good, relatively low priced starter box. The quality was not what I was hoping for, however. The background cloth has about a 3/4"" gap between the sides, so you have to be careful when taking your photos, especially with larger items to make sure no external areas are visible. One of the halogen bulbs burns brighter than the other, but that hasn't affected the quality of the photos.Overall, it meets my needs and I'm generally satisfied with it."
4,Great value! Actually works!,"I was excited after I received my shipment and hurried up to set it up in just minutes! As a freelance photographer, I get many requests for still life photography, but sometimes I run into problems like bad lighting, background, etc. This little studio solved my problem! The only draw back: the lights heat up REALLY fast! You have to shut them down every 10 minutes or so, or you will start smelling things!"
3,Too much money for the quality,"This product works well to take pictures of small items. It's nice that you can fold it up and store it. The camera stand, however, is pretty flimsy and if your camera is too heavy, it can be hard to get it to stay still. There are NO instructions on how to get the legs of the lights out. Don't try unscrewing the bottom cap (it's not supposed to come off). The design is pretty bad. You have to unscrew the light head from the stem (to prevent ruining it) and then hit the stem at an angle until the legs pop out. I had to use pliers to get the legs of one of the lights.Overall, even though the pictures come out ok, this product is way overpriced!"
5,Amazing Pictures,"This kit is all you need to start taking great photos for online auctions and websites. The screen provides diffused lighting that really captures all of the detail wihtout any glare.The tripod is not the most stable, but it will get you by in a pinch."
4,The Sensuousness of Shindo,"The deconstrunction and demystification of the samurai myth had been a project Akira Kurosawa had taken upon himself and that had seemingly reached a conclusion in YOJIMBO (1962), but Shindo's ONIBABA (1964) takes it a step further by presenting them as bedraggled and exhausted, hungry and at the mercy of two seemingly innocuous women. Shindo's world is hot and sultry, the characters weak and vulnerable. This is a very good depiction of the affects of war on the fringes of society and the lengths certain parties must go to in order to survive. As well as exploring this theme Shindo also adds several intriguing layers, sexuality and jealousy make a potent combination, as does the inserion of old Japanese folk tales. The result is a film that shows the eroticism of human beings in their most natural and stripped down state. Be hypnotised by the swaying grass fields and the sumptious black and white cinematography in this Japanese gem. Criterion's disc is very good."
2,vacuous adoration -- the death trap of a bad movie,"There is much to say of my surprise at the shimmering reviews this pathetic second rate Japanese movie has received here on Amazon. It is this very incongruency that compelled me to interject a grain of lucidity into this vat of oily adulation. Let's be honest about it -- the movie is horrendous, has very little artistic value, unless you consider the very repetitive shots of the pampas rustling in the wind to be art, and a mundane plot. The only virtues possessed by this flick are its obscurity and er badness -- all requisites for a drinking game with a bunch of degenerated con-vivants. Onibaba is NOT in the same ballpark as Kurosawa by a very long shot. I much rather recommend Kwaidan as far as old Japanese horror goes. Hope you don't fall into the snares, but if you must, don't be fooled into the pretense of substance."
1,A STINKER!,"This is one of the worst movies i have ever watched. Poor acting and poor plot. Silly ending. It starts out rather exciting then it starts going downhill like a rocket. The movie is also pornographic. It turns into a porno about 50 minutes into it. If you must watch it, rent it. If you want a great and spooky japanese thriller, watch kwaidon. It is a 5 star production. Four seperate tales that are awesome."
3,Doesn't Live Up to It's Title,"I bought this C.D. I really enjoyed it, but too many movie blockbuster theme songs were missing. What happened to Tara's Theme from Gone With the Wind or Over the Rainbow from the Wizard of Oz. Of course, many titles are recognizable, but there has to be at least 5 songs I hadn't heard of before,over 10 songs that weren't definitive enough for me, and 5 or 6 songs that weren't sung by the singers that you most commonly here sing them! If you want some nice music that you might recognize, get this C.D., but if you are looking for a C.D. filled with the most memorable songs ever recorded from Hollywood's biggest films... I have to tell you to keep on looking!"
5,Great Glazunov!,"Glazunov is underappreciated. He wrote great music. I love Raymonda, the Seasons, the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th Symphonies and his Violin and Saxophone Concertos. Anissimov and the Moscow Symphony play this music well and are a good choice and, of course, you can't beat Naxos for quality at a great price. Don't just get the Raymonda Suite, get the complete ballet music. You have everything here."
3,Quality Latin -- weak story,I had never read The Little Prince in any language before this. I can't imagine why it's so popular. I guess it's because it presents many people a dreamy escape from reality? But let somebody else judge the literary merits of the story itself. I bought it primarily because I wanted something easy to read in Latin. The Latin part of it is fine. I read it with relative ease.
3,Not the same key as the actual show,"Unfortunately, as often happens with the vocal selection books, the songs in this book are not remotely in the same key as the musical itself. Not helpful if you are preparing to perform the actual show."
5,Love this album !!!!,"Rarely I like all the songs on the album that I buy but that is not the case with ""Limon y Sal"". I like all the songs and the music is just great. Yes, it is a little bit lighter than ""Si"" but does not mean it is worse. It seems to me that she had a lot of fun recording this album, just by looking at the addtional DVD from recording studios in Buenos Aires.I just love it and listen to it every day and highly recommend it to anybody."
1,Busca otras alternativas,"Disco totalmente comercial, el cual solo busca eso; vender discos.La Venegas de la epoca de cds como ""AQUI"" esta olvidada en el pasado. Canciones y visuales fresas estilo la Rubio o la Thalia.Quizas con este llegues a tu primer millon."
3,"Wonderful, but not her best","I regret to say that I was a little disappointed with this, her latest album. I feel that our queen is becoming more ""poppy"".However, I strongly reccommend her first and second album to truly enjoy the essence of what Julieta has to offer.Apparently Julieta is exploring different genres, which is great, because her voice is lovely, and she sounds great singing whatever, but her fans are not used to this change.I really enjoy track 6 ""De que me sirve""""Ultima vez""""Eres para mi"" is a fun, guilty pleasure!!!but, #13 is what made this purchase worth it, the song writing and style is exquisite."
5,Buen disco,"Si, es cierto que es algo mas pop que otros, pero es muy muy bueno. No agunté las ganas de comprarme esta edición en 5.1!!!Lo malo y malísimo es que no suena la parte CD, por lo que tendré que escucharlo de manera DVD en formato Stereo, porque un pequeño pasar por las canciones me dejo mucho mas que desear, pensé que era algo más cercano a lo que hace Björk con sus surround. Espero cambiar de opinión mientras lo vaya descubriendo. Eso si, el sonido es impecable, y nada que ver con cualquier otra edición."
5,Great worldbeat!!,"Killer arrangements! I had only heard of these guys when I saw them live in Las Vegas...they blew me away! I am totally impressed with the upbeat, diverse rhythms they mix in with catchy hooks and pop melodies! ""Sit Down"" is my fave!! Highly reccommended for anyone who loves rhythmic dance music."
2,Difficult to read,"This book is a collection of LOTS of nursery rhymes, riddles, and charms, some familiar and many now obscure. There is an introduction tying certain rhymes to events in English history, but it assumes the reader is already very familiar with English history and isn't the best introduction to the topic for the modern American reader.Overall, it was difficult to read because of the formatting. There were a lot of random numbers (maybe placeholders where pictures were in the original), but they mixed in with the occasional footnote, creating a confusing reading experience.If you are interested in old nursery rhymes, this would be a neat reference to have on-hand, but it doesn't make for a good cover-to-cover reading experience."
1,Am I missing something? THIS ALBUM STINKS!,"I must be out of some loop cause I bought this album and hated it! The music is totally repeatative and it evokes nothing new or special to electronic music. The rhythms are weak and boring. That's probably the reason why the album isn't a continous mix. I've tried listening to this album more than once thinking that it would grow on me... NO SUCH LUCK. This albums stinks. The only song on here, for which I bought this album for, that is half way decent is his cover of ""The Way"". I just can't understand why this guy is so popular in Europe?! Aren't those guys alot more savvy when it comes to dance music? I guess I was mistaken. TRUST ME, this album really sucks!"
5,Unique and Addictive,"After hearing ""I'll Fly with You"" on the radio and reading other reviews I bought this CD. I was a little hesitant because of so many other DJ-mixed or compliation-like CDs with only one or two great dance songs and a bunch of other teeny-bopper pop, sappy love songs or bad rap, but I bought it anyway with high hopes. I was NOT disapointed. Every song is like the popular catchy singles you hear on the radio. You know, the ones that come out of nowhere and have the techno/synthesized edge to it, but the pop stations play it anyway. Put them all together and this is a great album. Where did this guy come form and why have I not heard of him until now. If i worked out this would be the perfect work-out album. I play it in the office at work and it keeps me energized for the whole day, plus there isn't any profanity to interrupt any important phone calls. My co-workers like it too. This is by far the best impulse buy I've ever made with a CD. I hope yo ulike ti as much as I did."
5,A great mix of techno dance music!,"I heard one of Gigi's songs on the radio and figured he'd probably be another one hit wonder, but I had a gift certificate and figured what the heck, I'll try it. I love it! It hasn't been out of my CD player since I got it! There is a great mix of different styles and beats. I like the first CD, Chansons for the Heart, better than the second, Beats for the Feet, but only because I like a few more words mixed in with the beats. I'd definitely recommend it if you like techno music. I'm ready to try another of his albums..."
5,Sweet cd,"I discovered Trance, Electronica and Dance music through my bf, and this is a combination of all three.The songs all have really catchy melodies , and are great for my iPod for long walks home, driving in a car or being high on your own supply, lol.MY fave songs are: The Riddle - sounds medieval, with a great beat, its happy and makes me want to break down into a dance,I'll fly with you- one of those kewl soongs you know you heard somewhere and didnt know what it is, and then bam you find it on this cd and you are so much happier for purchasing it, great tune.Passion Medley and Another Way are one of those classic great to have in your collection songsfor a great time hanging out and listening to some really fun but cool music.This stuff is not boring or repetitive and doesnt give me a headache. Its nice to listen to a cd and not Skip to the next song constantly.Great cd to add your collection, perfect for a party or some good time!"
5,On time & fabulous,"I ordered this the day before a road trip, and received it on time and in great condition."
4,Recommend it...,I have not bought the cd but I know some of the songs of this cd and personally it would recommend it. I have also gone to a concert and it is mounted the shows well. Alone to also say that I have understood that he has good pleasure for the cars ;)... ferraris.
5,What I have been looking for...,"This is definately one of my favorite CD's in my collection. I find it hard to find an album that I like every song on it. But this one is definately to good to pass up. I fell in love with the song ""fly with you"". Well, come to find out, it is one of my least favorite songs on the whole album. Why don't they play more music like this in the United States? They have even stopped playing ""fly with you"" on the radio, but still manage to sneak a ""Back Street Boys"" song from two years ago in. Figures that the record companies would be holding back on exposing such great artists as this one. I feel if you LIKE ""fly with you"", you will definately LOVE this album."
5,The Best On Electronic Pop Music,"Let's just putted on this words, Gigi it's the best on Electronic Pop, I've seen him on stage he's incredible, I was spechless when he started singing ""I'll Fly With You""."
5,I think this was the best song ever made by any song writer,I like this song because it helps the heart and fills your emotions with wounderful thoughts about different things and ideas. Thank you R kelly for giving us somethimg wounderful to listen too.
5,Very nice song!!!,"I don't remember when I first heard this song, but I do remember the time when it happened. I had just left my 4 month girlfriend to go live in another state with my parents...I really had no control of the separation.Well, back to the song...I'd say it's a really smooth, uplifting & could say, sad song. Makes you think about a lot of things when it refers to your significant other.I bought the cd right away and listened to it for hours.I do recommend it if you like R Kelly and if you are into ""slow jams"" and R&B;."
1,When you burn in Hell - THIS will be playing.,"Everyone's favourite comedy kiddie-fiddler really pulled out all the stops on this single. This could well be the worst song ever written, a shameless rip-off of Unchained Melody, you wonder if maybe Kelly is taking the p**s, because it's SO bad, so cringe-worthy, you're half expecting it to turn up on the sequel to Team America.But, no. He's being serious, and for every ""Ooooooh"" garbled sound effect he gives, every meaningful look he gives to the camera in the vomit-inducing video, you just know he's thinking ""man, I gotta score me some jail-bait tonight"".Awful, awful, awful. Burn every copy you see.(...)"
1,i love this cd,i love this song because is remind of when me and my girlfriends broke up for no reason whatsoever and this is the best song that his ever did in a long time.
3,underage sex,"There is a very popular commonly-exercised steady trick of spatting at the US by creating movies about non-stop mafia-feuds based on inter-racial abuse and hatred, on which landscape sex scenes are the most entertaining viewing element of, while referring to classic masterpieces as this film presented.This show is exactly a perfect example of the blooding murdering Italian-Sino gangster-fighting to dominate extortion from/""protection of"" the local NYC Downtown businesses.Beautiful girl and a very handsome sexually advanced baby-looking block of a misunderstandable age are really nice in a particular act of more-to-imagine-than-shown.This movie is the most interesting to enjoying sexy-looking young men testosterone-fuelled fights and shooting on the dirty streets of a seemingly American New York-location.Really, ""Make Love-Not War!"" is the best short description deployable in this case."
1,Seriously?,"I got this as a gift and am totally baffled at it's genius. How good of an idea does this sound?Lets take a standard, crappy, 15 cent ball-point pen and shape the body like an astronaut because, sure, an astronaut is a comfortable shape to hold in your hand. Now, lets put fins on the feet of the astronaut. Why fins? Your guess is as good as mine. Now here's the gem: you can install astronaut into a spring loaded ""Launch Pad"" for display on your desk. When you push the red ""Ignition Control"" button on the pad the pen launches 24 inches off of your table and lands - ball-point end down - stabbing the most important document on your table. If you attempt to catch the Astronaut before it seek-and-destroys your paper work you get shanked by the pen's business end. Why anyone thought this was a good idea is beyond me."
4,A good entry in the series,"This collection totally ignores rock's early years, not featuring anythin prior to mid-60's Bob Dylan. Again it is limited to recordings in the Columbia/Epic library, which is fine, but it does make for a distorted view of the 'music for the century'.As a series of snapshots of rock music from the 60's to the 90's it is well worth your attention."
2,Pointless Sampler for the Over 50 Set,"The Train Kept A Rollin' is a random collection of songs from the Columbia back catalog. In every case the shortest edit of the song is used. The 11 minute plus opus ""Time Has Come Today"" by The Chambers Bros. is cut to a brief 3:33. Boston's ""More Than A Feeling"" is down to 3:29 (originally 4:45). ""Frankestein"" (Edgar Winter Group) is a mere 3:27 (full version is 4:44). Santanta's ""Black Magic Woman"" has been separated from ""Gypsy Queen"". Sly Stone's ""I Want To Take You Higher"" should be 5:42 but is down to 3:04.As if to say Bob Dylan is the be all and end all of rock, the set starts off with ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" and ends with his forgettable ""Love Sick"".This is a truely pointless collection.[DW]"
5,Another Triumph for Don Carlos!,"In Castaneda's last book we see how erroneous logic results from thinking sorcerers are smarter than the average man; in a way they are less smart, says don Juan, because where an average man would think using his self as a reference point, a sorcerer would not think at all. Don Juan also reveals how he tricked Castaneda into impeccability by putting his irresponsibility on the left and his self-importance on the right, therby cutting them off from the reason and will that empower them. Written without the aid of dreaming, unlike previous works, it is still a wonderful book, and is very pleasing to the only friends he has in the world."
1,Disappointing.,"I was extremely disappointed by this book. I was hoping for something as tight, solid, and intense as Carlos's earlier works.The style of writing, the subject matter, and the voice of this book are different than those of the previous texts. This book is more lose, more narcissistic. And while it doesn't have the structure of the older books, I find it soullessly formulaic in its execution.I was willing to believe in the extraordinary characters like Don Genaro, Don Juan, Dona Solidad, and the rest. With this book, I find myself becoming bored and not willing to take that leap."
2,"Nice, but it's not Carlos...","A decent read and contains some interesting tidbits. Clearly written by a scholar in linguistics, Carlos was an anthropologist. Has some well written linguistic insights. Has a rehash of Carlos's work but I have to say I find much of it unconvincing. Don Juan asked Carlos to thank 2 people who had helped him on his way. This thanks what not in any way spiritual but consisted of giving them material objects. The real Don Juan would have laughed himself senseless at such folly.So, I give this book 2 stars because it has some value but no more since it gives itself out to be something it is not. Carlos never wrote this."
2,I don't believe Carlos wrote this book,"The style of this work leads me to think it is a collection of writings - perhaps some by Carlos - that were assembled by an editor to turn out another book (after Carlos had passed?).There is really nothing new here, though that can be said for some other volumes also, and I don't think it should be considered part of the Castaneda legacy."
5,Fantasy or truth?,"This is the fifth Carlos Castenada book I have read. Like the others, it was a gripping read from start to finish. Casteneda was truly a gifted writer. How else do you explain his ability to write so convincingly about ethereal matters? I am, however, left with one nagging question: Was it real? If so, then we as humans are really in the dark, living as we do in our world of concepts, constructs and perceptions. If he made it all up then all I can say is, what a storyteller! One thing is certain: Reading any of Castendas books is delightful entertainment. You won't be bored for a minute!"
5,Carlos wows me yet again,"Carlos is able to explain the things I feel in a very thoughtful way. Thank you, Carlos for sharing your experiences."
3,Interesting,"Carlos Castaneda committed academic fraud. However, the chapter from this book, entitled ""Mud Shadows"", corresponds precisely to a process in life that took 5 years to complete."
4,"""Bell""izioso!!!!!",Exquisit..... simply exquisit. Joshua Bell has taken those wonderful melodies from West Side Story to a new level.... 19+ minutes of pure joy!
5,I also got one for my doctor--,"When we saw The Red Violin and we fell madly in love with the film and the music we had to own it. And we do. Then we saw Joshua Bell doing something from the West Side Story CD on Today and had to buy the album. Today I bought another and we're looking to buy more. There are no words to describe this genius. There is nothing to compare the beauty of the sounds that eminate from his talent. He is incomparable. No one ever could equal him. No one has and no one will. We thank him for hours of sheer enchantment found nowhere else. And with all that has happened since September 11, this is the only thing that has rescued us from the depths of hell. Thank you Joshua Bell. May you ring forever and ever and ever."
5,Absolutely Thrilling,"These pieces are really concertos for violin and orchestra, based on works by Leonard Bernstein: The lengthy ""West Side Story Suite,"" selections from his musical ""On the Town,"" ""Candide,"" and ""Plato's Symposium."" Joshua Bell's playing is lucid, effortless, and spectacular."
2,Many errors in Central New York,"I bought this product for use on my boat with my GPSMap60CSx. The first time I used it, it showed my boat traveling on land near the water. This didn't happen with TOPO US. I compared the two programs and found that US Inland Lakes had a lot of location errors in my area. I have found places where it shows roads running ""in"" the water. I sent an error report to Garmin. Even if they correct the problem on future versions, people who bought this disc are stuck with the errors. It can't be depended on for navigation in my area , at least. You could easily run aground believing you were in deeper water. If the reviews had an option to insert photos, I would add a couple screen shots of the errors."
2,NOT VERY ACCURATE,"I bought this product with fishing in mind, but.... it has serious accuracy problems. Depth contours are off by as far as a couple of hundred yards. It does not show connecting channels between lakes, and some state boat launches are omitted. If you buy this product for a general overview it will be fine for your needs. If you buy this product as a TOOL that you are going to implement on a day to day regiment, save your money."
4,Great product but they charge to much for it.,"The company was great, offering the brand name product at a competitive price and delivering the product in a timely fashion. I am hoping that competition decreases the cost of these software products. At about $100+ per program, it is almost cheaper to use a navigator that comes with your cellphone for city and purchase a product for marine use that is installed in the boat rather trying to buy software to load that is sometimes incomplete and may need updating in the near future."
1,Very Disappointed,"I live in Montana, and this mapset only included depths for 1 of the lake that I fish. I wish I had more hands so I can give this mapset 4 thumbs down!"
1,No detail,"My Garmin 545 comes with preloaded costal maps. They work as advertised.But the $99.99 inland maps card lakes needed detail. On Lake George, NY, it does not show marker or warning devices. Only the 1890 survery (free from the US Government) depth and shoreline information shows on the device. Other makes provide the needed detail. This is a very poor showing for Garmin."
2,Disaappointed in Garmin,"I called Garmin to verify the buoy information for Lake Hartwell in GA/SC was on this database, and was told it was. What a disappointment! After installing the expensive Garmin data card loaded with the pricey little datacard reader, I found there is very little added information over the regular database on my GPSmap396. This is one time Garmin dropped the ball, then badly train personnel lied about it. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Good Resource,The Humanities is an excellent resource for exploring the various fields in the humanities. Each chapter covers a different topic and highlights the main concepts. The reference resources are becoming a little dated but the overall content is sill good. It would be nice if the edition was updated soon.
2,Dijon??,"If you are looking for the real Dijon mustard taste, you will be disappointed. Also the taste of this mustard is find, it does not have the strength or the specific taste of the traditional French recipe."
2,Won't be finishing the alphabet,Couldn't really get into the story or the characters and didn't finish the book.The writing style did not draw me in and the characters were not compelling.
2,endless reader,Sentences TOO choppy. Becomes very tiring in the beginning. Almost gave up on reading it.
3,Mom liked them,They were a lot bigger in person than they looked. That bottom pearl is about the size of an M&M (only round). They were a gift for my mom and she liked them so I guess thats all that matters.
2,HUGE earrings!,"I still can't believe how big these earrings are! They are also very pretty, so I'll probably keep them anyway. Definitely not for everyday wear, unless you want to go for the drama. The picture is deceiving, it makes them look smaller. Pity."
1,best of hermans hermits,"i was totally disappointed in this cd, because all of the songs were not the original cuts. this is especially bad when you are familiar with them as they were released. i hope in the future there will be something on the page about the release to let me know this fact."
1,Absolute garbage,"This is not Herman's Hermits. This is a tribute band playing their songs. Badly, out-of-tune,the wrong chords, and.........with the wrong words. HAHAHAHA. . . It is AWFUL. One star is the lowest rating? That is a bad idea."
4,Good whole-world overview,"I've read several of the TimeFrame books. While far from comprehensive, the series does a good job of hitting the major points of world history without ignoring the fact that the continents of Asia and the Americas existed, as many 'classical' histories do."
3,Great Coffee Table Book,"EXCELLENT color photos of the pieces listed make this a visually beautiful book. Set up in three sections as Weller's early, middle, and late periods, with pottery lines listed alphabetically within each section. Years produced and history are peppered throughout sections. Easy to get around if you are familiar with Weller. Index lists patterns and major shapes, but could do better listing by animal name, etc. The reason I rated it as only average is that only a few pieces of each pattern are listed, and are not always listed together if they cross the time sections used. Going through ebay, I'm lucky to find one out of ten pieces to try to price. If you are hoping to use this as a pricing guide it is missing too many pieces. The prices that are listed seem to be pretty close, though. Overall a very pretty and informative book as long as you're not looking for a comprehensive pricing guide."
4,"Great bristles, detachment problems","These bristles have just the right combination of softness and strength. However, since I only use this as a back scrub brush, the detachable design is not optimal for me. After a few months, the brush-handle attachment point became compromised (probably from all the exposure to water), and I found that the brush would often detach from the handle as I scrubbed my back. At this point, many more months down the road, the brush no longer stays mounted to the handle at all, so I am looking for a (non-detachable) replacement. Even so, I recommend this product because of it's great bristles, and also because the handle was great while it lasted."
4,"A nice, simple product",It has great bristles and a nicely shaped hardwood handle. Re Madoo's review: Forewarned is forearmed. I put 2 #4 stainless steel wood screws countersunk flat into the handle back. It looks great and will never come off in my life time - outstanding!
4,Good Item - price considered,"The tounge-and grove way the handle detached make it easy to use in the shower (dont have my glasses on). The detachable brush has medium soft bristles and will be easy on the skin. The strap on the brush is cotton, so this probably isn't a once-in-a lifetime purchase, but very good for the price. Everybody needs one!"
1,Broke within a year,"I bought this brush less then a year ago. It has a number of problems. The head detaches from the handle on a regular basis. The cloth band is a magnate for mold. I had to cut it off due to mold buildup. Lastly, this morning, I tried to wash my back with it and the entire plastic holder of the brushes broke to pieces. In to the trash can it went."
4,Long Handle Shower Brush,"Was having problems replacing my old shower back brush, could not find a long handled one of reasonable price. This one seems to work well and seems to be of good value."
4,A nice enough read,"Hello! I am the translator of this book and the reviewer is right, I am not familiar with the Japanese language; it woudl be nice if I were, but not really essential, since I translate from Hebrew to English. I transliterated the Japanese words from Hebrew and the author - who claims a deep and expert knowledge of all things Japanese - corrected them into what she assured me was the correct, phonetic English spelling.My sincere apologies for any offence caused."
2,Japan Over-generalized,"I have to say that I was sorely disappointed in Ms. Horn's oversimplication of a very complex society. I lived in Japan for 11 years and am married to a Japanese man. Although she states that she has the utmost respect for the Japanese people, it is not reflected in her words.I agree with the other readers that a more detailed account of her life as a Jewish woman/diplomat would have been a much more interesting read.Finally, the horrible spelling of all things Japanese was unbearable and at times - believe it or not - made it impossible to understand what the author was referring to."
4,Enjoyed every moment,"The book is an easy read novel, very funny. In spite of the humor, it brings very honest account of the encounter between very different cultures. I found that aspect fascinating."
2,Disappointing,"I should have liked this story. It has espionage and WW2 England. Wot Larx, right? But somehow I found it tedious. Yes, it has some surprises, but most of those were unpleasant and unwelcome. On a positive note, I liked traveling through wartime London for a bit."
2,Vastly inferior to the earlier Inspector Troy books,"I liked Black Out and Old Flames, but this book just isn't worth the money. John Lawton ought to give me a free coupon to his next book--it HAS to be better.Poor plot, very little time with Inspector Troy, and everybody and every situation is one-dimensional.Re-read the earlier books and wait for your library to order this one."
1,Insipid Pablum,"This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. Chock-full of cliches and phony Brit-speak, it was a nonstop yawner. There is just no way that our hero Cal Cormack is on first-name bases with upper echelon military figures, British coppers, and assorted politicians. Forget this garbage and read a Bernie Gunther novel instead. You'll be glad you did."
5,Excellent historical novel,"This book was filled with atmosphere, humor, history and interesting characters. It was the first Insp. Troy novel that I read and John Lawton got me hooked from the get go. The characters are fully developed and different from your usual mystery characters. I am ready for much more from this author."
1,Book arrived in terrible condition,"Not even readable, pages pulling away from spine, which is itself crumbling. Very disappointed in this purchase, even if book was cheap."
3,Like reading someone's diary!,"I bought a used hard-back book and it was pretty ragged. Had to discard the paper cover, but it was okay for the price. This book is a quick read. She describes all of her affairs in graphic detail, and there were so many! I'm surprised she had time to make movies - she slept with everyone except Lassie!"
2,Sordid Story,"Although it was interesting to read about well known actors and actresses from my youth, Keyes told a sordid and sad story. Lists of all the beds she hopped in and out of got pretty tiresome. In 2009 who cares? She wrote well so I made myself finish the book"
1,Difficlut to use,"Week 2.. One week later, and i still hate this machine..its getting louder, and the spindle and disks make an awful noise when I turn it of, and they come to a stop. the bowl is still hard to remove, and the lid is also hard to get on and off...ZERO stars for this product..Black and Decker should be ashamed.week 1.. Our last processor was great. This one however, is very hard to remove the bowl. The ejection spout is too wide, and the cabbage I grind flies out the sides past the collection container. I have to use a flexible chopping mat inside my container to try to keep the food from going all over. The spindle is a pain also..Just too much work to use.."
1,Pure JUNK!,Hard to use. Messy. Food flying all over the place. Hard to close. Hard to open. I threw it in the garbage last week. I replaced it with the Hamilton Beach big mouth - a little more expensive but a very good item.Stay away from this item! You have been warned.I give this 0 stars.
1,do not waste your money,"at first, i loved this processor. it did a great job with the blade attachment. the grate on top was a useless feature, it did not evenly grate or chop things at all. the storage was awful though. very inconvenient. it is hard to put together. has to be very precise or it will not turn on. then, after about a dozen uses, the bottom rim of the bowl came completely detached, making the thing useless. i bought several new black and decker products for my kitchen and tools for my husband because i recognized the name and thought they would be quality. however, every one of them is junk and have been thrown away. don't waste your money."
2,What a disappointment!,"I bought this food processor primarily for making baby food. I had previously had the Cuisinart Mini-Prep and loved it, but alas, I accidentally put it on the bottom rack of the dishwasher and warped it. When I went to the store to replace it, they didn't have the Cuisinart, but I thought I'd go with a bigger food processor, anyway, as it would be more versatile.What a mistake! The B&D; does have a bigger capacity, but it takes up a huge amount of counter space. While it does a fine job of pureeing, it also spits out food through the chute and makes a huge mess. (After using it to grind oats for making homemade baby oatmeal, I had bits of oat EVERYWHERE. Same problem when pureeing pears.)I'm going to call the store where I bought this and see if I can return it."
1,8 cup bowl broken,"This thing is almost impossible to remove once it's locked into place. I've had it for about 2 yrs and I refuse to buy another just yet. However, recently while trying to get the durn thing unlocked, the handle of the bowl broke. Now I have to try and find a cheap replacement to get my by until I can afford a decent food processor."
4,Fragile But Beautiful!!,"I love J Renee shoes and bought both the silver and the pastel versions of this shoe. Both right shoes pulled out where the thong attaches to the sole after just a few wearings. I took them to a local cobbler and paid $8.00 each to have them repaired. I get lots and lots of compliments on these shoes and love wearing them as they are very pretty and comfortable. I have many pairs of J Renee shoes and have never had a pair break until purchasing this particular style, however, I would buy the black patent ones if they weren't sold out everywhere, even knowing they would probably pull out and have to be repaired as well."
4,A worthwhile read,"Though I'm an Old Order Baptist, there are many insights within Matthew the Poor's writings. I appreciate the scriptural references which add in understanding his perspectives. It has the academic side along with the experiential. Thanks to the Lord and the Coptic Church."
5,Live Recording,"Isaac Karabtchevsky directs the singers and modern-instrument musicians of Orchestra e Coro del Teatro La Fenice in a recording of Italian sacred choral music.The works on this recording:1. Motet: In exitu Israel de Aegypto (psalm 113), RV 604Composed by Antonio Vivaldi2. Motet: Credidi propter quod locutus sum (psalm 115), RV 605Composed by Antonio Vivaldi3. Missa solemnis pro pace, Op.71Composed by Alfredo Casella"
4,Great Music,"Britney Spears and her CD has an energy that you can't describe. Her songs are great and have an awesome beat. I usually don't like this type of music, but when I hear it, it makes me want to jump up and dance! I recommend it to anyone who likes a CD with a great beat!"
5,This is the best party and dance song ever!,Britney's voice and her moves in the video make the song's beatgo to the extreme! she and darren henson (the choreographer) shouldwin a lot of awards! That girl is so talented!
4,I like this CD 'cause it's got some good messages.,"This CD has a good beat and rhythm. I also like the remake of, and the beat goes on."
3,"......ok, has a good beat","Britney Spears is an amazing woman. She makes so much money, yet she can't even buy the whole shirt. Well, I am not here to critisize the person but to review the song, ""Drive me Crazy, (remix)"". I think this song has a great beat to it, you are forced to get up na dance to it. I like the song a lot. The lyrics are wacko but anytime I listen to it I have to either dance or sing along, but Britney....try to act your age sweetie."
5,I think it's a great song because it has such a up beat.,"This has to be one of the best Britney Spears songs. (You drive me)crazy, has such a cool beat and it is so danceable. The original version was great but this one is alot better. Good job Brit."
4,Update those dusty albums,"If you're a fan of Commissioned from WAAAAAAY back in the day, this collection is a great way to upgrade to digital on some of their early Light Records output. The entire albums of ORDINARY JUST WON'T DO, WILL YOU BE READY?, and ON THE WINNING SIDE can be found here. You won't get lyrics or complete liner notes, but for around 8-9 bucks used for all 3 it's a sacrifice you can make."
5,One of my favorite books,"This is a very enjoyable book. If you like crafts, gardening, cooking and just enjoyable reading I'm sure you will find this book to be on your favorite list. I enjoyed reading about her daughters wedding preparation."
5,Part one of a wonderful pop music trilogy,"Sony Records released several compilations like this one, to celebrate the turn of the century. However, the only genre that had three part collections, spanning so many years, was pop.It starts out, ten years early, in 1890. To me, it's like a prologue. After that, there isn't another tune until 1911. That makes the first track even more of an introduction. Some people might complain, but there wasn't really that much music recorded that early on. This was when people started actually using personal record players. This album spans fifty years although the other two only span twenty-five years each. I think it's due to the way that the music became.This compilation shows how the music grew from something much more low-quality, into something very big and extremely well-produced. Afterwards, it shows the development from ragtime, to swing, to the more modern Frank Sinatra style. It is definitely a great part one of the trilogy."
3,a very good introduction to hydrodynamics,As soon as I needed to make use of this book I found how good it was at its explanantions and even for a novice in the area it was well written and clear. Somehwat old now but nonetheless a solid introduction to hydrodynamics in the tradition of Lamb. It sits well next to that beacon of fluid mechanics Batchelor.
3,Beautiful but text is limited,"I was delighted to find this book because it was a general book on Indian tribes giving information on more than their many troubles in modern times. I found the photography beautiful and informative on how these peoples live. Much of the text was helpful also. However, there were no specific bibliographical references nor index, and it seemed to be based on work done in the 1800s which I would not trust."
1,Disk don't work,"I have bought video from Discovery Channel before, and this was the first time I've had a problem. The disk just freezes in certain spots, and locks up the whole DVD player. It doesn't happen with other disks, so I can rule out my player. I cleaned the disk, and even used a disk repair on it, but it still is not working properly. I ordered another episode of B.B. and had the same problem. I'm not happy with the quality of Discovery's product and will probably not buy any more disks."
2,not what I wanted,It looks nice but...Putting two cakes in doesn't work. It is probably wide enough for three so the two kind of sink together in a sticky mess. I was thinking it was two separate compartments and each compartment just fit the cake. Live and learn. Would not recommend this.
3,Not squirrel resistant at all....,"The feeder is attractive enough, although the leaf design gets in the way of birds trying to feed. It was described as squirrel resistant, but there is absolutely nothing in its design to deter squirrels. They were dining quite happily five minutes after I hung it up. ( I then made it squirrel proof by hanging it from a tall baffled pole in an open area.) It is easy to load and holds two suet cakes as indicated."
1,Pretty but pretty flimsy,I took it out of operation after a month filled with repairing it after birds and/or squirrels beat it up. The opening is harder for humans to open and shut than for animals. I've had to replace the hinges and now I have to find a way to latch it so the critters can't open it and let the suet fall to the ground.
2,This is not DADA,"Being a DADA fan for years, I jumped on this cd. Well, I was disappointed. This is way to pop compared to DADA. I thought many of the songs were boring. Maybe it's not fair to compare this to DADA, because of the amazingly high musical standards that DADA reaches. Butterfly Jones dosn't come close."
5,Dada's Equal,"I've seen some reviews posted here say that this CD is almost as good as a Dada Cd. I disagree. I've got the first four releases (I just found out about the other two), and it always seemed there was a cut or two on each one that I would skip. BJ is a different story. Fourteen cuts and I love every one. I didn't know quite what to expect when I bought this, but I'm blown away, and also saddened a bit because I know that this music will probably remain obscure. If there was any justice in this world, Dada and now Butterfly Jones would be superstars."
5,My Favorite Album,"This has replaced OK Computer as my favorite album. When I'm King of the World, this CD will be standard equipment on all convertibles."
5,Napalm Springs: A Musical Masterpiece,"Michael Gurley and Phil Leavitt have done it again. Their new musical collaboration, Butterfly Jones, is quite meritorious. After their former band, Dada, one of the best (but underplayed) bands ever, decided to call it quits for a while, Gurley and Leavitt decided to form Butterfly Jones. The songs on Napalm Springs are reminiscent of the style of music prevalent in the 1960's, but at the same time remain totally innovative. Michael Gurley is at his lyrical best and no one can play drums better than Phil Leavitt. The songs ""Suicide Bridge,"" ""Sophie,"" and ""The Systematic Dumbing Down of Terry Constance Jones"" are among my personal favorites. The lyrics are intelligent and the music is well played. I would highly recommend Napalm Springs by Butterfly Jones to anyone who appreciates genuinely great music."
5,Relieve your Angst,"I listened to this CD over and over again and I can say without predjudice that the music on this CD, Napalm Springs, is far better then most of the new stuff played on the radio today. Someone said that radio stations won't play this kind of music because America is angry and the songs on the CD lack angst. Now, America is angry and with good reason, but the music on this CD is a resurrection of music in it's purest form. You will hear music that transcends the Beatles, Beach Boys, and other influences, beautifully sung and performed. If you appreciate songs that you hum along with or sing to or just plain like to listen to, then this is your buy. Buy it. You have nothing to lose and you will luv it. It Rocks."
5,The Colorful Wings of Butterfly Jones,"As a fan of Dada back in the day, I was excited when a friend told me that two of the former members had started a new band. Ex-Dada front man Michael Gurley and drummer Phil Leavitt are the core of the band Butterfly Jones, and to their credit, they definitely show growth with the new project. Butterfly Jones can easily compete with the Goo Goo Dolls and Sugar Rays of the world. ""Napalm Springs"" combines a melodic modern pop/rock sound with Beatle-esque harmonies and psychedelic guitars. It was produced by Scott Gordon who has also worked with huge stars like Alanis Morissette and Aerosmith, so the album has a catchy, radio-friendly sound. ""Suicide Bridge (Winds of Change)"" and ""Anywhere But Now"" have quickly become two of my favorite tracks. Listeners shouldn't expect Butterfly Jones to be another Dada - they have their own distinct sound, but it is one that will appeal to a broad audience."
3,Almost the fix that Dada fans are longing for,"If you are a Dada fan (which you should be, by the way) you have been jonesing for new material for more than 3 years now. Napalm Springs is about the closest thing you will find. However, none of te material on this disc reaches the level that Dada achieved, even on their first album. The lyrics aren't as catchy, the harmonies aren't as rich, and the instrumentation/arrangements are shallow. But the album is Dada-esque. And that, for many of us, is reason enough to add it to the collection. It can tide us over while we hope that the band comes to their senses and gets back together."
3,"Thanks for the ride, I get off up here....","...I can tell, because I can see by the string sections, layered synths and excessive production that I've reached the outskirts of RadioFriendlyLand.The El Subliminous ride you took me on from DizzKneeLand to here was a blast - even better than that Trip With My Dad! We saw some great American Highway Flowers along the way and enjoyed some awesome music to boot, as we traveled almost to Heaven And Nowhere. You even got me to start playing the bass guitar back in '96! But I can't go with you to Napalm Springs - I need to go back to where the music is more organic. Don't look so Puzzled - you know my stomach can't handle overly-processed tunes. And Timothy needs me. So, thanks Michael! Take care, Phil. Much success!Hey Joie! You comin' with me...?!"
3,"if you like metal in general , give it a listen","This is a quite good cd covering many aspects of heavy music. Here you'll find bands whose music ranges from thrash and death to industrial. You'll find many of the grandfathers of the nu-metal scene like Helmet, Quicksand and Fear Factory. Also the Kyuss track ,although instrumental, is very impressive. The Sepultura track is very good too. But heavy metal fans beware: if you like your metal traditional , this cd is NOT for you. Also, i must mention that with this cd, comes a very thick booklet (more than 100 pages) that gives detailed info about the bands featured in the cd and that is quite fun to read. Overall, a very good buy for people into heavy music."
3,Romance Music,"the original music is amazing, but there are multiple tracks with the same music, but with different arrangements. Anyway is a very nice romantic music."
2,Pretty but too cumbersome for small hands,"I ordered an entire set of these plates, together with the matching salad plates, bowls and mugs because I thought they would be nice for kids' parties in the garden. When they arrived, I saw that they are not really ""plates"" but rather small trays. The lip is very high, which would make it difficult for children's hands to balance, and they are extremely heavy. I have other Zak plates that I would describe as ""patio tableware"" but this set is very different. True, the colours are brilliant and the quality top notch, but I returned them since they were not suitable for the purpose for which they were intended. I believe the product description is very misleading. I have never seen dinner plates wich such a high lip (this is not apparent from the photos). They would be great for serving drinks, snacks or fruit in the garden."
2,Rocking Golf Cart,"Seat to high and child falls out, steering wheel can't be reached. Smaller than I imagined."
5,A short lived series on DVD!,"It's nice to see Blue Thunder, the TV series, released on DVD, in spite of the fact it lasted only one season. It was one of the great action-packed shows to come out of the 1980s. You had James Farentino who piloted Blue Thunder. A very young Dana Carvey, who was the co-pilot, who was always referred to as ""JAFO"" (Just Another Frustrated Observator.) You also has Dick Butkus & Bubba Smith, two ex-football players, who appeared in the series as well. I like other reviewers here would love to have Street Hawk, another short lived series, come out on DVD as well."
2,Poor packaging and disc quality,"The quality of the video and audio are good, as reviewed by the others. I enjoyed watching the episodes again that I had watched years ago; and there are the ones that I had missed because I was too busy working at the time. I am disappointed with the patches of cloudiness on the surfaces of discs 1 and 2. The discs are viewable, but the clouding should not be there; and I am not sure of the long term durability of the discs. The center hub holding disc 1 is loose and the disc keeps falling off. I returned the whole set to Amazon for replacement. The new set has the same problems. I decided to keep the second set because I do want to finish watching the episodes; and the price is right."
3,Good 80's Tv Classic Show,"At last on Dvd.I remembered this show from my early days.I loved as A Team and Knight Rider were broadcasted these days.Only 11 eps were made after its cancellation due to similar series Airwolf in the rival CBS.Based on the 1983 movie of the same title it features an advanced chopper capable of doing 360 loops,whisper silent mode record audio and video,turbo thurst and fires 6,000 rounds per minute in her gatling cannon.Of course is armor plated and bullets ricochets when fired to it.The Dvd is Ok with good audio and video quality however no special features are included nor cast or series info.Hope Street Hawk that also was premature cancelled arrives soon on Dvd."
5,Magical read!,"Fire in the Mist, an early fantasy novel by Holly Lisle, is a delight! Fire in the Mist is filled with engaging characters, especially the main character: Faia Rissedote. Others, also interesting and memorable in their own way, are Medwind Song, Yaji Jennedote, and Rakell and her cat (with hands) Flynn. Even the villain of the novel has some sympathetic qualities.Besides intriguing, realistic characters, is the excellent play of foreshadowing and plot twists.The mage academy Daane is equally interesting, so is the unfolding history of Ariss, and the magic that exists in this world, as well as the people who wield it.If there isn't a sequel, I wish there were.Fire in the Mist is an excellent novel, and I encourage everyone who likes fantasy, originality, and Holly Lisle's other works, to read this one soon."
4,Started off average- improved as it went on,"I was ready to give the book 3 stars for the first half, because although it wasn't bad, it was a bit hard to follow without chapter breaks for different POVs and a small sprinkling of grammatical errors (I got the Kindle version from Lisle's site, so the printed works may be different). However, it got better as it went on, in many ways, and I bumped it up a star. Overall, not a bad start."
2,Boring,"I've read other books by Holly Lisle that I quite enjoyed - Talyn, Hawkspar, Minerva Wakes - so I was expecting to be entertained by this one. But it was quite inferior to Lisle's other works. I found the dialogue awkward and stilted, the characters somewhat shallow and dull, and the plot uninteresting. I started skimming after page 50, and gave up completely by the time I got to page 100."
4,Aburd and silly and very funny,"I can't help but laugh every time my monkey falls of the track at 20,000 feet off the ground."
3,Best GCN launch game,"Out of all the launch games, this is sadly the best one, and it's not even made by nintendo. This game is fun and original at first, but the novelty soon wears off and the replay value is slim to nil without the multiplayer aspects. Overall, a fun game, there's no wonder it was the best selling GC game in Japan."
3,mini games,If u want a game withe a few good mini games. this is the game for u. but if u get car sick this will make u throwup.
1,DANGER! DON'T BUY!,I THINK THIS SUPER MONKEY BALL IS ONE OF THE MOST STUPID GAMES IN THE HISTORY OF STUPID GAMES! ALTHOUGH I LIKE SOME OF IT! ON THE EXPERT LEVELS SOME OF THEM ARE SO HARD AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW YOU GET THROUGH THEM! SEGA HAS GONE WILD HERE! I THINK SEGA SHOULD SEE THIS REVIEW AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER! THE SECOND MONKEYBALL IS A WHOLE LOT BETTER! ON THE MINI GAME MONKEY BILLIARDS IS KINDA BORING BECAUSE IT'S ONLY 9 BALL! IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GAME LIKE THIS I HAVE THE PERFECT SOLUTION! DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS GAME AND BUY THE SECOND ONE! I THINK THIS GAME SHOULD NO LONGER EXIST!!!!!!! HERE IS MY LAST WORDS TO SEGA!BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Here IS MY LAST WORDS TO YOU!DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
1,LISTEN TO ME! DO NOT BUY!,as fun and cute as the 4 little monkeys may make it seem it is not worth it! i got gamecube with a budle of 3 games which wre great. i baught SUPERMONKEYBALL as my forth game with money i had to weedle out of my parents. i couldn't decide on weather to get SUPERMONKEY BALL or THPS3. me being the idiot i am kinda wanted SUPERMOKEY BALL and fliped a coin and ended up getting supermonkey ball. i warning u the game is terrible. I got home excited to play it. i put it in and started with beginner mode. the first level took 7 seconds(no kidding i timed it) the other 9 levels only took me 6 minutes to beat. I BEAT THE GAME IN 6 minutes and 7 seconds! its not fun. the graphics are good but the music is annoying and the game is not fun. it may be a party game but it is only for kids under 8 i think. and the toys r us that i baught it from won't even allow me 2 exchange it for THPS3. so now i'm stuck with this game and my parents are mad at me and will never lend me money AGAIN!!!
3,Scratched to Death,"I have played this game before, and loved it. Although, when I finally got the game (I had to wiat about three weeks for it to arive) the disk was scratched, badly scratched, and I couldnt use it."
4,"Very Fun, and not Impossible for some people like Number 2","This is a very addicting game, i liked super monkey ball 2, but that one was a bit tough at times.This version of the game is much more doable for most people."
4,Something's missing...,"Monkey in a ball. How fun is that? I DO know that it is a very fun arcade game, but after you complete Master mode and play the Mini-Games...DONG! It gets kinda boring. Master mode is fun and it is kind of hard to play but after you get everything it gets boring:REVIEWGraphics:4/5Okay but not perfect.Play Control:4/5It is easy but sometimes hard to control and tilt the floor so the ball can roll.Replay Value:4/5Very good for the Mini-Game, but after that it tends to lose flavor...Family Game:5/5Everybody will enjoy, that is, except the hardcore gamers. It is appropiate for all gamers, and the Monkey Fight game isn't violent, just a huge glove knocking the lights out of the opponent-no blood, gore or suggestive themes.I suggest strongly that you should rent it first, and it depends if you like it or not. It is very fun at the first, but after 2 days or so it gets boring. A lot. So, rent it. If you love it, buy it for the cheap price."
3,You'll go bananas!,"This is a rather strange game. You control a monkey in a hamster ball a complete various tasks such as roll yourself as a bolling ball, fly thru the air, or try to complete coarses while earning bananas. The downside is there really isn't any plot and 1player can get boring pretty fast. Though if you have a friend or two and an extra controller this game can dish out hours of fun."
2,This game is ok,"This game is ok. I would rent it first. you probably won't like it. If you do like it, BUY IT! Other wise DONT BUY IT"
2,Dont waste your money buying it!!!,"I just rented this game an hour ago and I already beat it. Of course there are mini games, but they shouldv'e made the game a lot longer. This is denfinitely a game to rent, because if you buy it, you'll only be wishing you didn't."
3,you may not like this game,the minigames suck!!!!!!!!!there is no plot at all and its very frustrating
2,Rental Only . . . . .,"This game gets very repetitive and very boring . . . . . very quickly. I purchased this game at a reduced price, and I am still regreting it. I do very much want to play some of the mini-games in Super Monkey Ball. However, I would need to play the normal game to earn the points to open them up. At this point, I don't want to subject myself to that."
2,Freaky Monkeys!,"Okay,like i said about pikmin""it's fun and challenging for the young and old""but THIS?okay,i think gamcube just made one of the kiddest games ever!The name(i mean,super monkey ball?what the stinky kinda name is that?)and the""cute""little monkeys...dumb enough to make me puke! I am not saying gc games are bad(which they are NOT)this is just to psycho! What will someone come up with next,mega bunny hop?"
3,A 22 year old's impression.,"I enjoyed the main game pretty well. To me, it seemed like a recap of the old Marble Madness games. It has a very well put together main game.I didn't like the multiplayer games much. It seems you are either good at them or your not. As it turns out, I'm terrible at them, and my friend was good. The side-games are interesting, but they frustrated me to no end. I simply could not do well with them.It's going to be a matter of preference mostly. I didn't want to spend [the money] just to enjoy one aspect of the game, since it's the only part I could play well. I recommend you rent this one first to see if you want to keep it."
4,Totally Cool,"Super Monkey Ball is a really cool game. It's definitly one of my favorites. Monkey Race, Monkey Fight, Monkey Billards and Monkey Target are all really fun. And the little monkeys are sooooooooo cute! But, unfortunatly, it has it's downsides. Not many downsides, but it does have some.Monkey Bowling is stupid, so don't play it. It's confusing, and one of the worst features of the game. Monkey Golf is okay, but it gets aggravating after a while of playing. Oh, and if you're doing Monkey Fight, choose Gongon as your charecter. If you're playing Monkey Race, choose Aiai or Baby. Super Monkey Ball is a lot of fun if you have 2 or more people, and is a great party game. Not so much fun by yourself, but that's just what I think. Overall, Super Monkey Ball is an awesome game."
4,mobile monkeys,MOBILE MONKEYSSuper Monkey Ball is what most SEGA games try to be. Fun and imaginative. This is one of the few GCN games that is truly a strugle to beat.
3,"Childish, but okay.","When I got this game, it was really fun, but soon it became tiring and boring within a week or two. I recommend this game for younger kids and people who like to use strategy and focus."
4,I SMELL SOMETHING BURNING ~~~~~~> (???),"THANK GOODNESS THE NINTENDO GAMECUBE IS A HIGH QUAILITY CONSOLE. CUZ AS MANY HOURS AS MY ROOMMATE AND I HAVE PLAYED ""SUPER MONKEY BALL"" YOU'D THINK A SYSTEM WOULD OVER HEAT. THANK YOU NINTENDO FOR SUCH WONDERFUL GAMES. THE REPLAY VALUE FOR THIS GAME IS UP THERE. ~~~~~~> EVEN AFTER YOU BEAT IT, IT'S STILL FUN TO PLAY AGAIN & AGAIN. DID I SAY BRAVO NINTENDO!!"
4,good but hard,"When I rented this game, I did not think that it would be very hard. But then i started playing and was blown away. The amazing graphics and tough tracks kept me occupied for a while, but when i played the Expert level, i just got frustrated after just the sixth floor! It became extremely difficult to make it through just tiny parts of the whole course. I would only reccomend this game to people who will just not give up"
3,thanks,kinda suck at this game but still kinda fun.need too get better at it then maybe wouldn't be so frustrating thanks though
3,WAY TOO HARD,"The game is a great concept, but the challenges (in the expert mode) are ridiculous. All but the first few are (even for a skilled player) impossible.And the dizzying and annoying rotation of the screen between each attempt drives you crazy.Also, you should be able to start at the level you completed, but you can't. You have to start all over at the beginning if you wish to advance to an even higher level.Unlocking the minigames takes too long. I got sick of this game pretty quickly."
4,"Good, but a marble madness [duplicate]",This game is fun. It has nice graphics and good gameplay. However it is a [duplicate] of marble madness
4,A blast with a group or alone!,"I loved this game and it is definitly worth the [item price]! There is a very, very small learning curve and after that you are good to go. The main game 'll keep you occupied (and sometimes frustrated) and the mini-games are a blast (pool, bowling, golf)The party games are equally fun, even more so when played with a group. I whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who loves a challenge and especially those who enjoyed a little marble maddness back in the day."
4,Historical drama with magnificent actors,"Timothy Hutton is luminous in this film, as the fictional son of the Rosenbergs. He should have own an award for this portrayal. All the actors, so many well known now, and including the children portraying the young Daniel, are wonderful. There are layers of story unfolding, and the layers are punctuated by the singing of Paul Robeson at intervals, giving a depth and weight to the already intense story. A few viewers may not like the parts where Daniel talks about the many forms of execution, but this is a small part of the film. I recommend this film to anyone who lived through the 60s, and interested in the many films directed by Sidney Lumet. Superb."
5,"Excellent choice of talent, as yet never surpassed.","It is seldom one enjoys the original music with a superb mise en scene, an interesting and appropriate choice of actors, great voices and a delightful conductor. Definitely should not be 'UNAVAILABLE'."
4,Firm seat,"This faux leather car cush is very well made. So well made that it is too firm for my needs. If you need a firm seat, this is the one for you. If you need something softer, go with the cloth covered cush which seems to have more give to it."
3,not their best,So far i have 3 'and one' cd's and this is definately my least favorite. I have yet to get 'virgin superstar'. If you are into synthpop 'and one' is a must have but my rec. would be 'spot' or 'nordhausen' before this.
1,Did not receive a single copy,"Did not receive a single copy. Tried several times to contact shipper, but no satisfaction, until it was ""too late"".I have subscribed to City Journal in the past - and it is a fantastic magazine.This service for magazines has horrible customer service. Ignored my initial requests for help, and then just blew me off.Buy your City Journal somewhere else."
4,"Terrific tales, Mysterious Missions","Great fun for christian family listening. Good christian morals included in each adventure. One of the better Adventure in Oddessy series. I recomend Terrific Tales, Mysterious Missions to young or old. Very upbeat stories that keep your intrest. I listen to them over and over, year after year. Friends are always barrowing this series."
1,Product is only for Vehicles!!,"Product ""only for vehicles"" visible only on box. Box cover cannot be seen on this site. Ruined my wife's birthday gift.One Star rating because I could not use it. Electronic Express immediately gave refund when returned, though, to their credit."
2,Struggling...,The pacing of the narration and examples is too fast. I find that the speakers in the examples are barely intelligible--too fast and too soft-spoken. My Hispanic friend listened and suggested that it's not a good choice for a beginner.
1,Router Burns Out,"I purchased this router via the Amazon Seller CTBooks26. About one month after I received it, it fried. First to go was the wireless. The ports died shortly thereafter. The router was unusually hot so I think it has a design flaw. Unfortunate since, up to now, I have never had any issues with Linksys products. I attempted to exchange it for a new one from CTBooks26; however, they quoted a 21 day return policy. They refused to exchange the item and advised me to go through the Linksys warranty program. Right... buyer beware."
4,Nice size ran hot,"Good size for traveling, did run hot and had problems with WEP. Once running it was great to pay for one connection and have 2 laptops on line in two different hotel rooms (nearby)."
3,Compact travel router but install took troubleshooting,"This wireless router is a very convenient size and configuration, but the setup wasn't transparent. I expected it to be ""plug and play"", but my notebook computer couldn't find the wireless network at first. It took several attempts and playing with the software configuration to make it work. The documentation and instructions should be expanded to incorporate more information or the CD should walk you through it when you run it. Functionally, however, this is a nice little router for travelers. Just try it at home before a trip so you won't be frustrated on the road."
2,"Not Robust for Reliable, Commercial Use","I bought this device with the hopes of accomplishing two birds with one stone:1) to have with me to travel around and ""plug"" into existing wireless or wired networks2) to extend my own AP at homeSad to say, this device works well for neither. It lacks support to connect to any remotely-secured wireless network. So if your network has a hidden SSID, uses WEP/WAP/TKIP/etc you won't be able to connect to it.Even still, broadcast signal was quite week.On a positive note, the device is tiny and comes with a durable case and nice Cat-5 cord. The retractable plug is a nice touch.And to be totally fair, I haven't tried the unit to connect to a wired network and then broadcast wirelessly. I might end up returning it before ever trying, though, because it did not meet my intial needs."
4,Linksys Travel Router,"Recently took my laptop and this travel router on vacation. I had occasion to use it as a wireless router with my laptop in wireless mode. There were also occasions where the lodging had wireless and then I used the router as a AP. In both cases, performance was what I expected.My only complaint is that with the power supply built into the router, it ran quite warm if used for an extended period. However, there were no problems."
2,Poor Quality,"Looks good on paper, but has severe issues:1. You cannot use it to access an encrypted network. Common, Linsys, would it hurt you to add WEP support for public network??2. Looses connection often. If I had it connected for more than ~24 hours - it looses connection to the outer world (without even noticing, the status is OK), and can only recover by powering it off and back on.Taking it back for refund, back to DLink."
2,"Nice, compact router but poor quality and support","It's one of the most compact travel routers out there and is fairly easy to set up. The built-in world-wide AC adapter is a nice touch (no separate wall-wart AC adapter). However, the quality on these devices is quite bad. I have 3 of these routers, two of which failed within the warranty period. These routers also get quite hot during operation, especially in hot climates. Linksys support is inane and it will take you at least 1.5 hours on the phone to get to the point where they are convinced that it's a problem with the router. Granted, they are told to follow the script and will not deviate one iota from it. In summary, I would much rather find a better option. If you do buy one, be prepared for the fact that they may not last very long and while Linksys has been good about replacing defective ones, you will spend 1.5 hours getting it replaced."
4,"Fairly smooth setup, nice portable piece, short range.","This Linksys Travel Router is a fine portable product, and the one Ethernet port is convenient as it allows me to plug my office VOIP into it; though don't expect any decent long range reception if you will also be using it at home, etc.The fact that it is all inclusive unit (no extra wires or power adapters) makes it extra attractive for travelers."
3,Worked great for 1 year,"Worked great for 1 year, I thought I could use this at home all the tme beasue of my space limitation. It lasted 1 year and burned out. If you just use it for tarveling you will be fine."
2,2 stars equal too difficult,"The limitation of not being able to connect to a secured wireless signal was the most disappointing feature. Otherwise it was just too difficult to set up. I travel a great deal and at my first stop on my latest trip I was unable to get it to work. I don't have time to play around with settings all the time. It should work as soon as I plug it in and turn on my computer. There are other travel routers around that do this, why can't linksys. The only nice quality was size."
1,Waste of money!!!!!!!!,You has to be in front of the WIRELESS ROUTER to get a good signal.I travel a lot and I bought it use it when I'm inside of my room. I just walk like 4 to 5 feet to the bedroom and I only have one bar of signal...I end up returning the Router and buying a Belkin Wireless G Router and work just fine. I even use it at home. Works great in the entire house.
4,Well designed product except setup is not perfect.,"I thought this is a very well designed router except for one flaw that I encountered. I really like the fact that there is no power adapter and the fact that plug retracts (so you don't have to worry about damaging other items in your bag). My one complaint has to do with the setup of this router. When setting up the router I put the plug from the modem into the wrong port and I was able to get on the internet with one pc but not share the connection. I called linksys tech support and they were unable to diagnose the problem. I then had to return the unit and the problem happened again when I setup the new router. At this point, I realized what the problem was and was able to correct the issue. Just seems that the setup software should have detected that I plugged the modem cord into the wrong port and told me such when I ran it. Would have saved me a 2 hour tech support call and them sending me a new unit."
3,Good but not great,"There is nothing wrong with this product. It does what it is supposed to do, but I think it is a little too complicated to set up and therefore would not recommend it. Linksys could do better on their software set up program. First of all, you should be able to download it when you have an internet connection and they should not expect you to have a cd or they should store the software on a rom inside the device.It should be easier."
4,Very good ! still room for improvements...,"This is a very nice product, the only drawback is that it can't log on a wireless protected network, despite that it's an excellent product.Right now it is replacing a D-link DI-624 router that keeps rebooting as soon as my laptop access the wi-fi, after switching for this little fellow not even one reboot...Be careful it tends to get hot...Cheers,London"
4,Fantastic Travel Router,"Just as advertised, this makes for an ideal travel router for use in a hotel room. I've been carrying it with me for months and never had an issue with it. Unlike some of the competition, I find the built in power-supply to really cut down on clutter. Simply plug in the ethernet cable and plug it into the wall, and you are all set."
5,R&B: From Doo Wop to Hip Hop,Great music! Brings back memories of of very good times and experiences.CD made a fantastic gift for a friend who was looking everywhere toreplace a former copy.
2,Too similar to all other Leap Frog Toys,"I would love this toy so much more, if it were at all different than the Learning Table or the Alphabet magnents. It plays the exact same songs, and does the exact same thing as the other toys. You would think they could be a bit more creative."
2,It's just ok.,"Compare to many of leapfrog products( in this price range)this one is so basic. No lights, creative sounds or many options. It sounds out letters and plays the same alphabet song heard in other leapfrog items we own. The easy to remove characters on the bus are quickly misplaced by toddlers, so the songs that come from pressing these characters is often not heard."
5,Fun for years to come,We've had this toy for three years and through two playful children. It has held up really well and is fun for ages 9 months- 4 years.
3,Quality?,"My one-year old grandson got this for his first birthday. He loves it, and it has good play value, as far as it goes; however, the quality leaves something to be desired. One-year olds do put things in their mouth all the time, and we noticed that the paint on the frog figures came off almost immediately. Now, this paint may be non-toxic, but does anyone really want a little toddler to ingest ANY kind of paint? I consider this a serious issue! It's also made in China, and we all know that a lot of toys coming from there are not really safe. Something to think about..."
5,So much fun,"I bought this for my son on his first birthday. He loved taking the little frogs out and playing with them for the first few months we had it, but then as his hand-eye coordination improved, he really loved pushing the little letter buttons and listening to all of the sounds and songs. He just turned 3 and still oves his little school bus!"
4,suprisingly fun,"My 10 month old loves this. I bought it as an after thought, thinking he would get more use out of it when he was older and was suprised at how much he plays with it now. He loves the figures, rolling the bus on the carpet and the music it plays and pushing the buttons. Its just going to get better when he starts really learning the alphabet and what it means"
2,-HELLO-,DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T GET THIS I MEAN THERE'S NOT 1 JIMI HENDRIX SONG ON HERE I MEAN I KNOW THIS IS POP COLLECTION BUT HEY 1951-1975 WHO ARE THE AMETURES THAT PUT THESE TOGETHER I AM THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO CARES ABOUT MUSIC..?
5,"At 3 years of age, my son learned to read","One of my three kidlets learned to read at age 3, and the book that he learned to read first was ""Bear by Himself."" He had a great pre-school teacher named Mary. One day I came home from work, and he had this book and was reading from memory, or so I thought. I began to listen carefully, and then after he read the book, I pointed out some words to him at random, and by gosh, he was reading! And, he understood what he was reading and what the story was about. I thank Mary for her patience in teaching him, wherever she may be. She was wonderful! My son is a voracious reader, and continues to read, just like all of us in our family. I am ordering him a copy for Christmas!"
5,Perfect book to teach children to appreciate the quiet times,"I went to my local book store and they couldn't find ""Bear by Himself"". I bought the original when my son was 3 years old and misplaced it. He's been asking about it recently and wished he had it. It warmed MY heart to know it still had a special place in HIS. I was so happy to see I could obtain another copy of it through amazon.com, but feel I may be disappointed as the more recent version has different illustrations as one reader shared. I still plan to order one, though, because the text is unchanged. The original illustrations were so beautiful and calming...I remember it so vividly. My son is now 12 and still loves being alone at times. He really relates to the bear. It was great to share the same feelings with all of you! I'm willing to spend a bit more for the book to get the original. If any of you know how I can obtain one, please email me. Thanks so much."
5,Lithium coin battery CR2016,I bought it to replace the battery on my car key. Great value as it would have cost a lot more to get one from a car dealer. Great item!
1,overpaid,I paid more for shipping than the cost of the battery. I failed to realize that the other purchase I was making was sent from the vendor. Should have shopped around town.
5,EXCELLENT,"Having no college background, but a great interest in the weather, I searched high and low for a comprehensive book that would be understandable and informative. This book greatly increased my knowledge of the weather. It is a quality textbook that covers, in depth, what other books just touch on. High and low pressure systems, fronts, weather systems, trade winds, jet streams, precipitation, clouds, visual effects, measuring devices and much more. I would really love to get the next book that carries on where this one left off, but to go much farther will probably require more knowledge of math and physics. This book also gave me the desire for further learning. It's almost contagious because the information is so amazingly interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who truly loves weather study. Completing the questions in each section really helps to hold the information gained."
4,Comprehensive,"I wanted to better understand the weather. How do systems form, how do they move, what causes it to rain? With no prior reading or knowledge on the subject, this book provided a clear, concise explanation that will help any reader better understand the nightly weather forecast and appreciate all of the variables that make an accurate forecast so difficult."
4,User Friendly Text Book,"Clear, easy to understand. Dvd and online bonus. And, I got an A in the class!"
3,"Great pictures, some outdated info","Being an older edition, I have found some of the information to be outdated. It works for an intro course."
1,"If it's not broken, dont fix it!","I wasnt aware that this album contained ""new"" versions when I bought it. It seems Vice Squad are now a cliche heavy metal band... right down to the silly guitar solos. The production is poor, very empty in places, with too much reverb on Beki's now scratchy vocals. If you like the original Vice Squad you'll be sadly disappointed by this effort."
2,Lousy (But Still PKD),"In my continuing effort to read all of Dick's work, I picked up the finally-reprinted Our Friends from Frolix 8 this week. What a disappointment!I really like Dick's writing, and I have even enjoyed some of his less than stellar novels, like The Zap Gun or Clans of the Alphane Moon. This one, though, just doesn't do much for me. It's got a decent premise and some decent (but predictably Dickian) characters, but it just doesn't pull it all together and produce.The climax was too long in coming and, once it came, was a let down. For the most part, I'm just glad to have finished it."
2,Why I don't like the flimsey male urinal.,This is a very flimsey product. I thought it would have been made of a stronger plastic. I'm afraid it will spring a leak in short order.
1,Not as ordered,The urinals I received were not as pictured. The ones received had covers attached and not removable as shown in the picture. This is not the first time I have been disatisfied. I will not return them but will find another source as these are items that I use frequently
5,love this!,"This urnal has reduced my ball shadow by 35%! Great buy, much cheaper than nutella! No drip top ,3yr warranty, can't beat it!"
1,Shoddy materials,"Retainer for cap broke first night. Other than that it's a bottle, but one that you don't want to tip after using. In other words, worthless."
4,Oh Yeah,What can you say about a product like this that has not already been said?Nothing - so don't expect to see anything that has not been said.
5,Perfect,Lid glows in the dark which helpful at night. Handle is sturdy and makes it easy to hold. Easy to empty and kep clean
2,Flimsy Lids,The lid connectors are too flimsy and do not last long! I am sure they can put better lid connectors on these.
3,nothing to write home about,Hey it's a budget plastic urine bottle. What more can I say? It feels light weight and cheap and will most certainly spill if you turn it on its side however it's very low price and so for what it is....it works.
4,Urine Bottle,This was OK of my Father at 94 But the Top to Seal it Fits SO SO .. but Still when you need one this will be the One you Buy as it is a Big Storage
1,Cheap=Cheap=Cheap,Cheap quality! GARBAGE I will NEVER buy these again from you-I can't believe you would even sell this JUNK-Bad Quality
1,Music that grates on your ears!,"I cannot believe the good reviews about this album. I got this as a gift and it is the most nauseating ear-grating music ever! Essentially, it is a choir of high-pitched children's voices screeching. DO NOT buy this . . . Buy Raffi instead. His albums are awesome, timeless and children's music that parents can enjoy too."
1,"Sacrilege, quite appropriate......","I am a big 242 fan and I am quick to purchase any thing that has 242 on it but this album is as the title reads, a sacrilege. The sound on the album is flat and amateur, not deserving to be called a tribute album to the godfathers of electronic music. whatever you do don't waste your time with this one"
2,cheap low quality and black,"color is black, not gray with what was shipped to me. complained to pelican and got a ""thanks for the feedback"" emai. @#$&&@#$!!!foam in dividers is really thin. this is especially true on the outside edges where it should be 2X thicker for good protection. the foam itself is about 1/2 as thick as the dividers look in the pix.its a low quality product... but what other choice is there if you want this ? the plucked foam falls apart if you make it too thin, and thicker, you waste space in the case. either way your @#$@#$!"
2,"To small,Too Much Money","This company just can't get the size right. Every camera bag should have one, The 81/2""X11"" is to large and this one is two small. They should make one at about 5""X 7"" size. If it was also a little less expensive I would recommend it to my 11000 students.The same is true with their White/Grey/Black card. In classes we would just cut them in half.Which we can't do with the color ones."
4,It's great,The previous reviewer has no sense of humor. Typical for pen name and admitted neo-feminist. I was elated to find this product. I saw a pillow at a card shop with this saying on it and wanted to get it for my daughter but it was gone by the time I got back. Reminds me of when she was a teen and the smallest thing would embarass her. Lighten up. Can't wait to wrap this up for the holidays.
2,Could be misconstrued,"I love these Mountaine Meadows plaques, let me get that out of the way upfront. They're witty and usually compress a whole lot of truth into a short phrase. But this one manages to drop the ball by being carelessly leaving itself open to interpretation. Read the phrase yourself, and you'll see what I mean (clicking on the picture will open a new window with a larger print, for those of you with aging eyes like mine). I would be very suspect of any father who thought this was appropriate. It is, on the other hand, easily construed as a thinly veiled threat. It's sinister, it's suggestive, and it was obviously conceived of by a male (whereas one of my favorite of their plaques shows the unmistakable touch of a classic neo-feminist, among who's ranks I humbly count myself)."
3,durability is a question,"I used this portfolio bag for the first time today. I loved it! The bag has a pocket, and the handle straps easily convert to a shoulder strap (that I used). The zipper unzips enough to open the bag flat. These features give this bag 5 stars. I used this bag to bring home my framed photos. I laid the bag down on my carpet, unzipped the zipper, opened the bag flat, and took out my photos. When I closed the bag to zip up the zipper, I saw that one of the four feet had fallen off and was lying on my carpet. That lack of durability gives this bag 0 stars, resulting in a rating of 3 stars when combining the features and durability. Buy this bag if you like great features, but don't expect the bag to stay together."
4,"Durable, which is an improvement over the other crappy brands I've tried.","It is a nice portfolio. Some things to consider: It is heavy, the handles are too long to not drag on the ground when holding it in one hand. As a shoulder strap, it is too short to fit over your head. It would be nice to have some adjustable straps."
5,Useful PrestigeTM Carry All,"This is a portfolio that is large enough to carry my photographs but light enough that I don't ache after carrying it to an exhibition. It protects my images and is attractive.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
4,Killer Instinct,"I was fairly impressed with this book. When some sport celebrities try to branch out into other career fields, in particular, writing, they do not always manage to do a good job. Ms. Navratilova did a good job in creating Jordan Myles who finds herself attempting to solve a mystery that affects her company directly. Enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the last chapter. Several tennis personalities that also make it interesting, if you are a tennis fan."
3,Not the best Jordan Myles Mystery!,"I love Jordan Myles! She is cool, controlled, in charge, has no money problems that hinder her elegant clue-finding via the hardest accessible persons and places in the tennis world! To her this world is home and we participate. GREAT! And in addition the characters are convincing, charming and the authoresses give us the best (real good characters are sacrificed for the plot). But this third novell has a disappointing end (NO, I won't tell a thing, read it and find out yourself!). Will Jordan Myles be Florence Nightingale in the next book? Well, it just doesn't fit, that ending. There are some credibility-flaws in this one, that weren't there in the first two novells. Can you kill an alligator with 38 caliber bullets? Well, I don't know. BUT: Read all three books and then lament with me or contradict me!"
3,Disappointed,"I had high expectations with this product. However, the metal bar that lets you set the tilt of the desk is a bit unreliable: surrounded by plastic that comes loose at times. Also, because of the lower bar, which is blocked by the base of most chairs, it is impossible to get the desk close enough to see the reading material."
3,Flyy Girl...great for young girls dealing with sexuality,"I'm only 13. I read this book over and over again and everytime I turn around I hear somebody talking about ""that Omar Tyree book called Flyy Girl"". The book has floated from person to person in my eighth grade class made mostly of girls. I watch my friends giggle over and over again about the intense sexual scenes between Tracey and her boyfriends and I was thinking, I need to read this book. I finally got my hands on the mystery novel and I read it and thought...well. Its alright, but its not flyy. Omar Tyree's book Sweet St. Louis was great but Flyy girl was on the sour side. I had to read this book. Afterall, like Omar, I to; am a Philadelphia native, but I was thinking, after reading the book...come on! This book is great for girls who are growing up too fast and need a taste of the real world but if your a little bit older or you're just not into these things you should save your money for a book like 'Sweet st. Louis' OR 'Do Right Man'."
1,This book gave young black male and females a bad image.,The one thing that I did appreciate about this book was that only one girl ended up pregnant. I mean at 13 SEX was the last thing that my friends and I had on our minds. I was from a middle class neighborhod like the one that Tracy lived in and we did none of these things. I feel that Mr. Tyree has put a bad image of our youth out there. Even though at the end of the book everything turned out fine these are thetypes of books that stereoytpe our black youth and make us look bad.
5,EXCELLENT-PHILLY!,"I read FLYY GIRL when I was thirteen and now I'm fifteen and I thought it was excellent. It showed me the direction I was moving in. The hot cars, the money everything illegal,basically, fascinated me and in a way it still does. The only difference is Tracy went through alot of things I have not went through and it puts you in a situation that you have to think about the decisions you make in your everyday life that you think does not matter but it does. This book is about everyday life and every young girl should read it."
3,Flyy Girl,"I also read the book Flyy Girl when I wasn't supposed to because my sister thought it would be to grown for me to read but I read it anyway. It just about a tennage girl growing up in Philly and going threw changes in life and I think that most of us do the same things that Tracy did, but someone just decided to write it in a form of a book"
5,Love this Series!,This is such an entertaining and well acted series! I love the Fae concept and all the actors do a great job. Each episode keeps you watching to the end. Season Two is even better than Season One. Highly recommend!
3,"Great show, poor quality DVDs","I bought this set new, but I'm only on disc 5 and it's the second one with serious play problems. (The failing discs don't have visible scratches or gunk, so it must be subsurface manufacturing defects.)My current DVD player is pretty good at adapting to scratches and damages of well-traveled Netflix DVDs, so for these discs to fail this way they have to be truly defective.This refers to a Region 1 disc set, produced by Prodigy Pictures Inc., giant ape media."
4,Lost Girl,"I always like this sort of thing. Fantasy, Pretty Girls, action, sex. This one has it all. A good series and I'm looking forward to the next season."
4,An Excellent Series,"Lost Girl Season One is good Fantasy only somewhat constrained by SciFi 's limited budget. All the characters are interesting, human and otherwise. There is a central plot that ties things together and individul episodes usually stand alone with a story that is captivating by itself, as well as advancing the central plot, which is how fantasy creatures exist in our world, in secret. Lots of drama, a wealth of characters with different abilities - did I mention that the heroine is a Succubus? That ads a touch of sex, that fits with the story. So what more could you ask for? Well, better sfx, but surely imagination isn't totally dead. You get enough visuals to enable the viewer to build on the details. I'm happy to say Season 2 follows nicely and very much look forward to Season 3Watch and ENJOY !!! :-)"
3,Case was broken when i received it,"When i got the season 2 disks the case was broken. It had alot of loose plastic in the case and now the middle flap keeps falling out of the page""lack of better word"""
3,Good Quality but lacks pockets,"I love the style, color, and split front. It seems durable and comfortable to carry. Unfortunately, there are no pockets or ways to separate items inside. Everything falls to the bottom and gets mixed up. Also the ""water bottle pocket"" on the side has a very small opening, so it doesn't accomated any bottle I have."
1,Re-Inventing the Wheel,"What did Naomi Wolf expect? Seemingly oblivious to a rich legacy of literature on the travails (and the bliss) of motherhood, Woolf has re-invented the wheel. Adrienne Rich, Jane Lazarre, Susan Griffin and Alice Walker said it all, far more convincingly, with by-far greater passion and wisdom, twenty-five years ago."
1,AWFUL AWFUL BOOK!!!,"This is one of the worst books a woman could read if she's pregnant. I have never read anything so negative and depressing about pregnancy and birth. I was seven months when I read it, and it brought me to tears. I am happy to report that my experience in the hospital was NOTHING like hers, or the other women who contributed their stories. I was treated very well by a staff of trained, caring professionals. My husband has been nothing but supportive and caring since the baby's been born. All and all its been a postive experience, and I'm pretty sure it's that way for most women. Don't read this book if you are pregnant!!!!!!"
4,Great book to begin a women;r journey into motherhood,"I thought the book was wonderful. I read it while pregnant and I moved from complete ignorance of childbirth in America to a very knowledgeable. I am so glad I read this book. There are few parts I disagree with or find questionable, but it is a very informative and important book for anyone who is expecting. definitely worth the read. I do agree that though she does address poor people's experience in being a mother and childbirth, it is mostly about middle to upper class. my hospital experience was very similar to how she describes, i did as much as I could to have a birth my way, but next time I would NEVER go to a hospital. Routines and routines. You may have a birth plan but they are used to doing things a certain way and will usually force you to conform instead of them.watch ""Business of being born"""
3,Misconceptions,"This book is about the journey through pregnancy, labor & motherhood. I am a new mother, so I thought it would be an interesting read. This is a very well-written book with extremely intellectual points. I did not necessarily agree with Wolf on many points and I did find her attitude to be quite negative. However, there were definitely some things that I did agree with. I suppose each women experiences different emotions throughout this journey. While I recommend this read to new mothers I would warn expectant moms to remember that there are a lot of negative spins on pregnancy & labor in this book that not all women experience."
4,"Good, but too much for just one book","I liked this book overall. The book made me feel better about my own pregnancy and birth experiences. But, I felt Wolf tried to cover too much information in one book. She had to skim over some items that could have been really good chapters in themselves. And at the end, it seemed like out of the blue she was calling for public policy/legislation. She could have just kept the book personal, but it seemed she decided at the end to make it more far-reaching than she'd originally inteneded."
3,There are better books out there,"If you are interested in this subject matter, I would suggest that you read Nina Barrett's ""I Wish Someone Had Told Me: A Realistic Guide to Early Motherhood."" It is a MUCH better book."
4,Valid and important information,This book was a roller coaster ride for me. I was intitially excited to read it. After all the fluff that is out there on pregnancy I wanted a book that would prepare me for the truth. When I read it I was disgusted that someone could be so pessimistic. Unfortunately my pregnancy ended up playing itself out a lot like the one described in the book. I was so frustrated and angry. I wished I would have paid better attention to the book and stood up for my rights. I can't go back but fortunately for those who are currently pregnant or plan to be pregnant in the near future this book can help. Consider yourself lucky if you don't have the same experience but prepare yourself for the worst the medical establishment has to offer. Knowledge is power.
1,Poor Old Naomi Wolf,"Ms. Wolf needs to see a therapist about her issues. She clearly needs help. Writing such a contradictory, self-absorbed, elitist piece of garbage doesn't do anyone any favors, except maybe makes her bank account a little larger, which she obviously values more than her kids.Her self-loathing and country club poor-me attitude got so trite, irresponsible and preachy, I couldn't get past the second chapter. This book is a HUGE disservice to pregnant and nursing mothers across the country. Yes, American vigilante obstetrics is flawed beyond comparision. Really, why didn't she follow her own advice to not go back for more? Why didn't she follow what she's so preachy to others to do? What a hypocrite.If you really want to read this boring, snide drivel, check it out at the library. Save your money for a GOOD pregnancy and motherhood book, like the new ""Ina May Gaskin's Guide To Natural Childbirth"" by a mother and a midwife who actually knows something about birth in the real world."
1,Me- -Again!,"Naomi Wolf is getting really, really tiresome. First, we got a treatise on how the world forces women to be consumed with their looks (written when she was a single young woman, consumed with her looks). Then, on becoming famous and influential, she tells us how important, how noble, it is to be powerful. But at least these books wrestled with ideas.Now she's had a baby, so, a book about having babies. There's barely the pretense that this book is anything more than a description of her privations as representative of Woman's privations, written in what felt to me a humorless and hasty way. It's the startling inablilty to really conceive of a world beyond herself that makes the book so disappointing. There's only so much that a book about Ms. Wolf's pregnancy hardships can inspire in a reader."
1,Wolf never takes personal responsibility,"She does her research and then doesn't act on it.She blames everyone but herself for her unhappiness.She whines.She doesn't seem to learn much from experience.Don't bother with this book. Much better ones are on the market.Try A Good Birth, A Safe Birth; it has stood the test of time.Also, don't miss Baby Catcher: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife for the real scoop and a rollicking good read.At the end of Misconceptions, you'll feel depressed.At the end of A Good Birth, A Safe birth, you'll feel informed.At the end of Baby Catcher, you'll feel empowered and uplifted.You choose."
4,important to read,"No matter what you chose on your road to motherhood, this book gives some great insight. I was very disappointed that Ms. Wolf did not learn from her own mistakes, and therefore ended up right back in the C-sec room. Hindsight is supposed to be 20-20 Naomi. However, there is much more to glean from this tale. The important info is in the sections on relationships with partners and PPD. How comforting to know that many women are not alone in their feelings after childbirth. I am reccommending this book to every woman I know in the hopes that change for birth-care is in the future for the USA."
5,A Great Read!,"Read this book openmindedly. Don't let it scare you. It is informative and knowledgeable. It is true that Naomi Wolfe does whine a bit...so, roll your eyes but keep reading. She does make you think twice before you step into a hospital to have a baby without asking questions first. It completely changed my perceptions of hospitals and doctors. I'm sure Ms. Wolfe would agree that if she helped open one person's eyes to the everyday practices that goes on in hospitals, then it was worth writing this book. I am that one person. This book changed everything for me. It helped me make informed decisions about my childbirth experience. Do your research...and start by reading this book!"
5,Eye opener,This book is so true. . . very scary to admit some of the things but so true. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
5,"If it's been said before, why has nothing changed?","Perhaps we have come a long way baby. But the phenomenon described in ""Misconceptions"" - that is, the THEFT of birth away from moms and the systematic disrepect doled out to pregnant women in America - has NEVER been expressed in a way that received much widespread attention. Naomi Wolf acurately describes the corruption of our ""mainstream"" medical institution, as well as the varied thoughts and feelings which are unique to pregnancy, yet experienced by MANY.After having a baby myself, I realized what a sexist world we still live in. American women are possibily never more disrespected than during pregnancy and childbirth - the most ""womanly"" time of their lives.I find it not coincidental that (...) review (...) dismisses this VERY important work. Yes, other books have been written about similar subjects. But even more are needed!They may be able to shut us up for awhile. But not forever!"
2,What a kvetch!,"Wolk whines and complains throughout this book. The good points she makes, the worthwhile information imbedded in the text, they're all too easy to overlook as readers become majorly irritated with this Kvetch Class Act.Skip it. Instead, read one of these:A Good Birth, A Safe BirthBaby Catcher: Chronicles of a Modern MidwifeWhat to Expect When You're ExpectingSheesh..."
2,"""Mom, you're embarrassing me!""",It's books like this that give narcissistic yuppies of below average intelligence a bad name.Worth noting that even the usually perky 'Publishers Weekly' was appalled. (Read their above review.)Morning sickness was never this bad!
2,What am I missing?,"I bought this book based on the rave reviews and immediately made two of the recipes. Neither of them was anything I wanted to serve to family and friends. I kept checking the recipes to make sure I hadn't forgotten something. Nope--all there.As someone who bakes quite a bit, I found the recipes lacking some detail and I think there are better techniques than some of those offered.I'm sure this is a great bakery in person, I'm just not overly impressed with the book. There are far better books (and recipes) to be had if you're looking to make a good dessert."
1,Big disappointment!,"I am not a professional baker however I do love to bake and bake frequently. Everytime I try a recipe in this book, I am terribly dissapointed. This book is just not worth my time."
1,Misleading Cover!,This book is written by the co founder of Magnolia Bakery that is famous for their cupcakes. The cover of this book has a photograph of 5 cupcakes. I have been looking for a great cupcake recipe and bought this book based on those 2 factors. There is not a single cupcake recipe in this book!!! I feel misled and cheated.
1,the red velvet cake does not work!,"I lived right around the block from Buttercup for 2 years and had countless red velvet cupcakes! I've worked as a chef for over 10 years and was excited to buy this book and make my own red velvet cakes. I've tried the recipe in this book twice now, with the same result! Dense, not very good cake. It's like it's missing a levening agent or something. I just don't get it!"
4,Awesome recipes but beware the red velvet icing!,"I've owned this book for at least 6 years now and everything I have made from this cookbook gets rave reviews--especially those darn cupcakes! Hardy anyone bakes from scratch these days so making something out of this book will really set you apart. People who say they can't tell the difference between storebought mixes and icings and homemade are either lying or lacking taste buds.The only item that I made that has been disappointing so far was the red velvet cake icing. WAY too much butter in there, it tasted like butter and was inedible. I have since supplanted it with a recipe I found that calls for using 12oz white chocolate chips in the icing, cream cheese, 2 sticks of butter, and confectioner's sugar to thicken a bit, and it has made all the difference.Happy baking!"
2,Bought for my collection based on the cover ....,"...turns out the cover was the best part. The cookbook looks great displayed - but I made several recipes and all results were incredibly average. I bake A LOT - not a novice, and there is nothing special here. Pretty to look at .... ends there."
4,"Tasty, comforting treats","I've been very happy with everything I've made from this book. I love the cookies and the banana pudding is amazing! There are amazingly satisfying recipes in this book. I'll be making things out of Buttercup for years to come. Others have compared it to the Magnolia cookbooks (The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook: Old Fashioned Recipes From New Yorks Sweetest BakeryandMore From Magnolia: Recipes from the World Famous Bakery and Allysa Torey's Home Kitchen). I don't see any reason to not have them all, though."
2,One big dud!!!!,"I was attracted to this book because of the cover photo...it was the best part of this book. Very few photos, and very few cake/cupcake recipes. Not what I was looking for and a big disapointment."
3,Good Chick Flick,"Ok, most realize that chick flicks are usually really predictable. I thought this one wasn't AS predictable as some chick flicks I've seen. I enjoyed it."
3,A Real Feel Good Movie,"Three of us (ladies) thought the movie was ""Great""!Walked away feeling so good, so good in fact we went to DQ afterwards!I will purchase dvd when available!"
4,"Despite the title, the movie is not really about dogs...","I caught this on WE the other night. Lane is doing her normal unkempt, middle aged depression role, and Cusack was actually really likeable. The large family was funny as well, and Stockard Channing provided a some comic relief. It was a bit uneven, and it was allowed to unfold not really in a perfect way but kind of as if it was really life happening. This makes for some really boring parts though. Not a terrible movie, not a great one, but one somewhere between Ok and likeable. Watch if you are looking for something light."
2,The Best Part Was The Dog,"I wanted to like this movie. I like John Cusak and usually everything he is in. Diane Lane is also usually reliable. I can't really say that they did a bad job or that Dermot Mulroney was bad either. I liked his character though I thought pretty much right off that he was the ""too good to be true"" guy and was going to end up being a cad. Christopher Plummer was excellent and has been in just about everything he is in lately. He is like a fine wine or an untapped treasure that is we are getting the pleasure of seeing in some fine work. But this movie was just your typical 'You've got mail' 'Sleepless in Seattle' stuff. That is not bad cause I liked those movies but this was just nothing special and completely predictable.The best part was the dog. A beautiful big old black furry Newfoundland. His performance was at least a 4 star."
1,Awful - Hollywood at its worst....,"I usually try not to write negative reviews -- following my Mom's advice about not saying anything at all, blah, blah...But this movie is simply awful. And I write that it is awful not out of malice but out of disappointment. With such a stellar cast -- Diane Lane, John Cusack, Chris Plummer, Stockard Channing, Elizabeth Perkins -- you'd expect at least ""watchable."" I do not blame the actors or the writer. I blame the directors, the producers, the editors and the Hollywood movie ""machine"" that lacks the courage to do something that is not formulaic and trite (and supported by a snappy soundtrack). It is easy to see how this movie got made, but unfathomable that it got made this way...."
1,wish i had that 2 hours back,"Horrific. The only reason I sat through it is because my kitty cat was holding me down with extreme cuteness and cuddling. Horrible script, non-existent direction, acting? What acting? I loved Diane Lane in Under the Tuscan Sun, but I'm afraid she gave that movie everything she had and the only thing left for succeeding movies is the left-overs. Don't waste your time and money. P.S. I've never written a review for anything ever before, the horribleness of this movie drove me to it. P.S.S why isn't there a ""no-star"" option?"
4,"""You must love dogs!""","And I do. The cast was terrific, it was a chick flick but many guys like this one too, Diane Lane was awesome and Cusack was believable in the role. I thought that the dialogue was ""on the money"" most of the time; but there were parts where it was stretching a bit. Because of the actors, the cute script and I guess because I just love dogs, I watched the movie a couple of times; first, on a plane and then I confess...I purchased the move and watched it again. With so many movies with ""serious messages"" that make you feel depressed at the end; it is just refreshing to watch a mindless comedy which just makes you feel good. Now what is wrong with that?Bentley/2007"
4,"Funny, romantic cute story","Well, if you are looking for Pride and Prejudice, this is definitely a 1. If, however, you are looking for a cute, romantic love story that's not inappropriate for family like so many, this is a must see."
3,Good.,"It got a little predictive at the end, but the beginning and middle was good. Is it me, or does Diane Lane favor Jennifer Lopez. She might even look like a mature, better model of her. :-)"
1,Yawn...,"Not only is this sorry attempt of a movie boring, but the acting is atrocious, the direction is awful, the editing is poor, and the story is...stupid. I felt that they tried encouraging one to get into as many ""love"" relationships as possible. Shallow. Meaningless. Dull.If it were possible to give a lower rating than one star, I'd give it negative ten.T.K., 14"
1,I am so sick of movies like this!,"I am so tired of movies where the entire plot seems to revolve around sex. In this case how long its been since the main character had it, how much her siblings encourage her to get it from anyone, how much can the guys get and how many girls can they get it from, etc. This entire movie was like this from start to finish. I didn't even care that the girl ended up with her guy at the end."
2,A Romantic Comedy Gone Wrong,"I did not enjoy this movie and, in fact, did not even finsh it. If your idea of romance is being disappointed to find one man entertaining another woman, driving across town, and hopping into bed with a different man -- well, I would feel sorry for you. Yet that is what our heroine deems a good day.Also, John Cusack's performance was lacking in energy. Diane Lane's role was too similar to under the Tuscan Sun, and this movie does not compare favorably to that. Do yourself a favor and watch You've Got Mail again."
3,"Fluff yes, but played for all its worth by a fine cast","MUST LOVE DOGS is everything you'd expect it to be with a title like that: a silly rehash of internet dating, this time with older candidates all recently divorced, trying not to appear to ridiculous in this cyberworld of instant matchmaking. The script is weak, the story old hat, but with a cast like this, who cares? Watching the likes of Diane Lane, Elizabeth Perkins, John Cusack, Stockard Channing, Dermot Mulroney, and Christopher Plummer in an ensemble covers a lot of cracks in a flimsy script. The overall effect seems to be one of an attempt to make a statement about the current conditions of relationships in the computer age among divorced people. It doesn't: it just throws out a lot of clichés which are delivered with as much panache as possible by this cast of talented actors, seemingly on break! Grady Harp, December 05"
3,"It's a romantic comedy, not real life, folks.","I don't understand all the bad reviews. A romantic comedy by its very nature asks us to suspend our disbelief for the better part of 2 hours. Case(s) in point: ""A Fish Called Wanda"" and ""French Kiss"". This is a good movie for what it is...a light diversion that doesn't tax the brain, make us cry, or make a political statement. John Kusak is understated in his performance(a good thing), and Diane Lane is surprisingly droll in hers. Want a smile on your face at the end of the credits? Watch this one."
2,The best parts of the movie are in the trailer,"I thought I was going to really enjoy this one, but found it to be a very shallow story overall. John Cusack was good in his role, but the story itself was a disappointment. Plenty of sexual references, really trite and unappealing. Wouldn't see it a second time."
3,Just O.K.,"This was a ""cute"" movie, not a great one. There is a fair amount of humor, an occasional surprise, and decent dialogue. Although the story line is frequently predictable, the characters are believable and enjoyable.John Cusack's acting is not the best. Diane Lane is beautiful and an excellent actress.If you like ""feel-good"" movies, I would recommend this one only if you have an evening without much to do.This movie is horribly overpriced at anything over $9.99."
3,A movie about dogs without dogs,"I like John Cusak. He isn't a great actor but then neither is Tom Cruise and Cusak is more likeable. This is a movie with a slow begining, a slow middle, and a predictable end, but then most romantic comedies are. If you are looking for some entertainment that is family friendly, that doesn't have any ridiculous car chases, no mindless desruction of property, no drugs, no gross scenes, and some relatively chaste sex, then this is a movie for you. I liked it, my wife liked it, and it was worth the time on a cold snowy evening. It ends (predictably) happily and I for one am really tired of seeing death, destruction, dysfunction,drugs, and profanity. I did think they could have had more dogs, which I think would have added to the film and made the slowness a little more tolerable. I only gave three stars because this is entertaining but not a really serious ""film"" but just a movie -- and an ok one."
3,MUST LOVE SAP,"MUST LOVE DOGS is very reminiscent of an extended sitcom, which would have played better with Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow. Diane Lane and John Cusack are too talented to resort to this lightweight romantic ""comedy""--which has few laughs. To think that Lane or Cusack would have any trouble finding romantic partners is absurd---to think they'd resort to the internet for pairing is even moreso. Ah, but such is the stuff of modern day romances. Where's Doris Day and Rock Hudson when you need them? Lane and Cusack are admirably adept in their poorly developed roles. Christopher Plummer takes a change of pace in playing Lane's widowed father; Stockard Channing stands tough as Plummer's new girlfriend; Elizabeth Perkins plays the matchmaking sister with her usual gusto; and Dermot Mulroney once again plays a selfish cad. It's all rather mundane, and mildly entertaining at best."
3,"Simple, yet delightful","The gorgeous Diane Lane stars as Sarah, a kindergarten teacher who has recently gotten divorced. Her meddlesome yet loving sisters try to force her back into the dating pool, but Sarah is still a little timid after the fresh scars of the divorce. Eventually her sister goes behind her back and posts Sarah's profile on perfectmatch.com, which launches Sarah into the whirlwind realm of dating. Along the way she is set up with a boat builder played by John Cusack. She clicks with him, but a series of confused emotions and other men puts their relationship in jeopardy.This movie was enjoyable, but forgettable. Some parts were funny and cute, but overall I found the story to be a little too easy and not as complex and engaging as a truly great love story. Good, but not great."
2,Predictable and uninspired,"Typical formula. You can probably outline the plot even before you pop the movie in. A few cute moments but, overall, a bland movie."
3,Worthwhile for the father's reflections on his late wife!,"This is simple-minded and predicable fluff, but it is upbeat. At least at the end of it you don't feel like you've been left with the weight of the world on your shoulders, like with so many other pretentious movies.The only meaningful part of the movie, in my opinion, is when Christopher Plummer's character reflects on his late wife, and his many affairs since then. He lets us know that he loved his wife very much, that she is always on his mind although she died years before, and any women he sees now are just diversions . . I'm paraphrasing but what he said was touching, credible, and made up for all the saccharine wholesomeness in the rest of the movie."
3,A Fun Little Romantic Comedy,"I wasn't expecting much from this film. The only reason I rented it was because I like Diane Lane so much. Lane is by far one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood. There were points when the film was a little too saccharin, but I though it had a nice message and featured a great cast. Along with Lane we have John Cusack (also greatly underrated), Christopher Plummer as Lane's horny, widower, Irish dad, Elizabeth Perkins as Lane's older sister, and West Wing's Stockard Channing as the woman after Lane's father. The cast really worked well together and there were some real emotional as well as comedic moments in the film. Granted, this film was not high art, but it is a fun little escapist film. If you enjoy romantic comedies with a nice little message, then this is for you."
1,What a waste of John Cusack,"I like John Cusack movies, I like Diane Lane. I hated this movie. The writing is bad, the directing is bad. Cusack and Lane are good, but they cannot save this movie. Do yourself a favor if you want a love story with Cusack get Serendipity."
5,Must Love Dogs,"Now this was really, really cute. I did love this movie and I own this because I will watch this many times. Diane Lane---great actress."
2,I love dogs but I hated this boring film,"Some girlfriends and I rented this movie for a girls night. Can you say disappointed ten times fast? This movie was boring, drab, boring, drab and repeat ten times. There was one funny part and that was when Diane Lane went on a blind date with her father (and really how funny is that?).If you love dogs, go down to the Humane society and play with them there and avoid this awful boring, not even worthy of a chick flick title, movie."
2,Eh...,I turned it off halfway through...shouldn't have rented it to begin with. It was boring and unrealistic. You don't really care what happens to these people.
4,this fills the void,"this silly sojourn takes the hungry heart on a semi fulfilling journey, where the protagonists eventually, gladly come together in the end, but there is an air of assuming in the end like the writers and the director phoned it in--they hug and act married in two scenes in the end, but it left me yearning...the fathers poem was memorable--brown penny, brown penny...I'm a perpetual diane lane and cusack fan--they seem to choose worthy projects- this story is campy, but what the hell. john's character at the time I first saw this paralleled mine in the hands-on shop/wood aspect, except that his shop was dust free. picky, picky. It works, at least for me-- its a classic in my library now."
5,Great Movie,"Such a great movie and family approved for all to watch together. Love the dogs in this movie, and the humor."
2,UMMM this is why I say stay away from the Personals!,"As far as chic flicks go I am a die hard fan! But this chic flick made us chic's look quite simple and down right lame. Alright we have a divorced middle age woman who is not looking but gets placed back on the dating scene, not a far stretch you may say. However put a couple of dogs in the middle along with horrible supporting roles in between and there you have it. This movie leaves you with no one to truly route for. Where this movie fails is the fact that the characters are boring and the storyline lacks depth. As far as date movie goes skip Must Love Dogs unless you must love torturing yourself through the pain of the ever predictable middle aged quest for love."
1,Zzzzzz,"I got this movie at work [library], hoping it would be good. I had seen the trailer for it and had high hopes. Boy, was I disappointed. The first 2/3 of the movie moved along relatively slow. Then, Diane Lane's character goes from being a sweet girl to being a w***e and dating any and every man, including having a one night stand. Ten minutes of the movie involves Lane's and Cusack's characters speeding down streets and driving eratically in order to find a convenience store still open...they want condoms.I think whoever wrote this screenplay should be humiliated, to say the least. It was made out to be this really ""great"" romantic comedy. It wasn't romantic until the last 10 minutes or so. It wasn't even remotely funny. I admit, there were maybe 2 or 3 one-liners in there, but other than that...I had to force my eyes to stay open until the end."
5,you gotta have heart,If you didn't love this movie and the soundtrack you have no romance in your heart. I watch this movie again and again. I love the dialogue. I would marry Sarah in a minute........right after Sally Field and Barbara Eden!!
2,6 Reasons this should have been good,"1.Diane Lane 2.John Cusack 3.Christopher Plummer 4. Elizabeth Perkins 5.Dermot Mulroney 6.Stockard Channing How can you blow it with a cast like this?The story was flatline and subpar. I can handle a formulaic chick flick just fine but this has no hooks or engaging sequences.The jokes are contrived. I kept waiting for the sitcom laugh track. Some of the sequeneces are down right emabarrassing ie the late night drive for the condom, 71 year old father inviting his internet conquests to holiday dinner, the ending, the whole thing.I would hit this with one star but put another one on for Elizabeth Perkins who was the only one to add a little bit of wit to this dud."
1,Must not Love E Pounds...,"Okay, this movie sucks bad... I like dogs.. don't love them.. and I definately do not love this movie.. and another thing.. this E Pounds guy or girl.. since you love the chick flicks... why dont you stop bashing all the good South Park and Family Guy TV DVD's.. you're pretty ridiculous.. and the ""Worst Movies"" section was ludicrous... you need to re-evaluate good movies.. cause the majority of movies on your list were excellent.. if i could.. i would write you personally.. but i cant.. and you suck dude... or dudette... by the way... What a Girl Wants sucks too..."
2,Call it--it's dead!!,You know how you know the actors are really trying and the screenwriter are really trying?? The lines are almost funny and the actors almost appealing?? There are actors you like and you want them to be good?? I wanted to enjoy this movie because so many good people were trying so hard--but--I could not wring a moment of enjoyment out of this film. It was flat. Lacked spark. Stick a fork in it--it's done!!
4,A slightly generous four stars,"This is a predictable, yet still mostly clever, romantic comedy. The heroine is recently divorced and not quite ready to admit she wants to start dating. Her meddlesome family is fairly endearing, the scenes with the losers they set her up with are mostly comical, and we do start to root for the romance to blossom. But it unravels a bit near the end. We know she's going to go back to the hero and the delays seem forced, almost like they had leftover dating scenes from the beginning that they didn't want to waste. The final mad dash at the end, when a simple phone call would have sufficed, was ridiculous. And the moment she jumped in the water, the movie lost most of its credibility.Overall, a light movie good for some laughs, but it probably wouldn't hold up to much repeat viewing.Amanda Hamm, author ofDear Jane Letters"
2,What dogs????,"I was really disappointed with this movie. I mean, it's in the title. Must Love DOGS. But the dog was only in, like, two scenes! What's up with that? The title makes it sound like a pet-lovers film, but it's not. The romance was sweet and comedy was great, but what about the dogs?"
2,You've seen it all before,"If you're in the mood for another assembly-line written girl-meets-boy, girl-loses-boy, girl-and-boy-bumble-around-for-a-bunch-of-scenes, girl-and-boy-get-together...then, this is the movie for you. Despite John Cusack's charm, Diane Lane's canned delivery, and Stockard Channing's ever-lovability the film never really lifts off and, at times, is down-right embarassing at times, and amusing occassionally. The scene where the two lovers go looking for condoms should be nominated for some kind of Golden Raspberry award for screenwriting...""Dopiest Scene"" or some such thing. No surprises, a couple laughs and lots of overwritten scenes. Sigh."
4,Short of a Great Chick Flick,"this movie really could have been so much better than it was. i have always been a huge fan of both diane lane and john cusack. this movie however, made their acting skills seem laughable. i believe that this movie could have been so much better if the script had been written by someone else. the story was sweet but not exactly memorable. the movie is enjoyable but in the end disappointing. this film is good for laughs but not one of the year's best."
2,Dull,"It is a typical ""chick flick"". I watched it because John Cusack was in it. What happened to him? He seemed at one point on the verge of stardom now reduced to being in stuff like this. This is something to watch late at night knowing if you fall asleep you really are not going to miss anything."
1,Must Love Dogs,"The DVD seems to be defective. I played well for better than half of the movie but then it would just quit, like someone clicked a 'Pause' button. If you leave it that way for a few minutes it would pickup at another spot in the movie and then do the same thing again... How do I get a replacement for this one???"
4,"Must Love this movie with these stars: Diane Lane, John Cusack & Elizabeth Perkins !",I watched this movie when it played in theatres and found itvery entertaining. Diane Lane again takes a leading role ina romantic comedie and she is pretty funny as thefourtysomething woman who is forced by her family to finda man. John Cusack is also pretty funny and entertaining inhis own funny and (sometimes) weird way. Elizabeth Perkinsrole is also enjoyable. She plays Diane Lane`s sister whois very nosy and brings some chaos to the plot.
2,Too many words...,The idea is good but too many words and not pratical. I stopped reading it in the middle.
5,great for new parents,"Hilary Flower collected suggestions and strategies from lots of different parents and presents them here. She focuses on toddlers as she says that is what new parents need. As the first-time mother of a soon-to-be two-year-old, I agree! I have several books with sound philosophy but I think this is the book that has the best concrete strategies for dealing constructively with your little ones."
3,Is it me?,"I had a copy of the CD about 10 years ago (the image with him wearing the cowboy hat on the cover) and I loved it. It was one of my most played albums at the time. Well, many moves later I managed to misplace it...so imagine how happy I was to see the MP3 version here! It was an instant buy.Here is where things get fuzzy for me. Is this the original version of the album? Because I really remember a different overall feel to the album. If this is (at least a partial) remix, are the originals out there somewhere?It's worth having on my ipod either way, I just wish it was more like I remember it..."
1,They converted .gov websites to PDF,"It appears that all they've done on this CD-ROM is harvest some .gov websites relating to Homeland Security and converted the websites to PDF files. If you have a good Internet connection, you're better off just using the Web. This CD-ROM is primarily useful only for offline browsing."
3,Not Sure enough to buy again.,"I did feel the heat from the thermogenic element included in the supplement. I'm not sure I can define that it did anything, but warm me up.I tried another brand of cortisol & thermogenics this time. I thought maybe if I took longer than the month Trimplex lasted, it may have shown signs of working, so it was not a quick results product for me by any means."
4,Good range of colors,"This set offers a good range of colors at a very inexpensive price. The pencils have thinner cores (leads) than other Prang pencils, and the formulation seems a bit higher in clay content - the color density and lay-down qualities were somehwat disappointing. Personally I prefer the Prang Professional thick-core pencils, but these offer a much larger color range in a budget-conscious set."
3,Reality,"Even though this movie may not have the flash and flare of some movies, the content and the point of the movie was good. It brought to the forefront something that many filmmakers have made jokes about but it is a reality. Some may not think that there are church members who actually fantasize about their spiritual leaders. Even though it may not be intentional for some, church members have to remember that their pastor is their pastor, the leader of the church. There have been several different kinds of movies out portraying Pastors and Reverends as skirt chasers but this shows a man of GOD that is upright. I enjoyed it."
1,Demand better independent film!,The quality of this movie was so bad I could barely make it through the first 5 minutes. But I suffered through the entire thing hoping that I could at least connect with the story but that didn't happen either.
2,15 minutes of early Zappa work,"This CD has 6 two minute tracks and is only 15 minutes long. It is songs that Zappa participated in from 1962 to 1963. Sound quality is good, especially for independent recordings from the early sixties.The first 2 songs were written by Zappa and performed by Zappa and Ray Collins (who would become part of the Mothers of Invention). The Heartbreakers songs are of unknown origin. These songs are typical early sixties, doo-wap rock songs. Think along the lines of Teen Angel.The two Bud Guy songs are Holloween, monster songs. These type of songs were popular in the early sixties, with Monster Mash being the most famous.If you want to get a historic perspective of Zappa, then you might enjoy this. There is some clumsy avant garde guitar work that is a sign of what is to come. I think the spot on the Tonight Show with Steve Allen where Zappa plays a bicycle tire is more interesting."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ATKINS DIET,I could not believe that some of these recipes contain from 4 - 48carbsFor people on the Atkins Diet this book is not a good idea; yes it does show you how to eat smart but I was looking forward to making really low carbohydrate meals for my partner.A waste of $3
1,Not Smart or Low-Carb,"I picked up this book because of Rodale's reputation for excellence. However, this one's a real disappointment. The recipes are not low-carb and the nutritional data doesn't add up correctly for many of them. And, it's hardly smart - since when is half a bagel a ""smart"" choice? Or half a cookie? And who can eat half? That's like giving half a cigarette to a chain smoker and calling it a ""smart choice"". No- pass on this one. There are so many really good choices now, that purchasing this one would not be very ""smart"". I would suggest Dr. Atkins and the Drs. Eades programs, that are backed by research, clinical documentation and a great track record for success."
1,This is NOT a low carb book...,"...you could ALMOST call it a ""reduced carb"" book but even that is debatable for some of the dishes. For those looking for true low carb recipes and advice, I definitely wouldn't buy this one -one dish will take up most of your daily carb allowance. Prevention Magazine, while a fine grocery store publication, does not do a good job with this book - at the very least they should not have called it a low carb cookbook.For those with a true carb sensitivity - where excess carbs cause wild blood sugar surges, etc. this book will simply leave you in a coma (kidding) or at least in a serious state of carb cravings. Skip it.."
4,Phil and Paul Hartnoll: Iron DJs,"What's with all the slagging on this album? I mean I'm not going to give it five stars, or claim it's one of the best in my collection, but I like it a helluva lot better than 2.5 stars. It was one of my most-played albums the summer it came out, and I still like it to this day.Yeah, it's eclectic. It's eclectic to the point where it looks like the Hartnolls were participating in a musical version of Iron Chef: ""Create a chillout DJ mix. DIFFICULTY LEVEL: must include one drum 'n' bass track, one PJ Harvey rocker, and no less than five reggae/ska songs. AND Jethro Tull.""And yet, they pulled it off, with flying colors.Oh, and this album also alerted me to the existence of the Moving Shadow label, for which I owe it an eternal debt of gratitude.I dunno. My other two most-played albums that summer were Carte Blanche 3 and Oasis's Heathen Chemistry, so when weighing my recommendation be sure to factor in the fact that I have terrible taste in music."
2,Interesting,"I am a big BTM fan. This release of the series is not bad. Given the quality of the last two: Talvin Singh and MJ Cole, this release feel a bit short. The one thing lacking on this CD is continuity. Most of the other CD's have different tracks buy yet a universal consistency among them. It really adds to a clean flow from track to track. This seemed like a true ""Orbital"" favorites with little (apparent) attempt to bring consistent feel to the CD. All in all not a bad a CD - much better than most of what is out there. A definate for true BTM fans."
1,Huh?,"I bought this album expecting something similar to the EBTG Back to Mine. However, I was very disappointed. I don't see how the tracks on this album could have inspired what Orbital has put out."
1,Over Priced Piece of Junk,"This is a very flimsy ""Robe"". It is made of the same kind of material that most cheap costumes are made of.I would estimate the retail value of this to be in the neighborhood of about Five Dollars....Including shipping."
3,Not really for young kids,"I bought this for my young son but I ended up putting it up on the shelf until he is ~10-12 years old. The mechanism to ""cock"" the gun is a too hard to pull and complicated for anyone younger.Other than that, it is a nice enough piece. I've used it and it works well. Construction is well built."
3,ok workout,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.Pros: Worked up a moderate sweat. Some of the moves were pretty tough. Much better than the other Angles workout from same instructor. Instructor non-annoying.Cons: Explanations were good but I would have gladly traded half of them for more of a steady transition-cue and a count (or louder music with beat to follow) since a lot of moves you face down or away from the tv. Overall, not as tough as I hoped --- could use more repetition of medium-tough moves in place of easier, pretty-filler-balance moves.I am thinking this would be good for beginners starting to work on their toning and flexibility or intermediate where you don't need to push too hard (a workout, not a challenging workout.)"
3,IMPOSSIBLE to watch & learn some moves at the same time!,"Wanted something low impact(not into yoga)to burn a few calories in the morning before work. You have to study the dvd first over and over so you can do some of the moves without having to watch at the same time, i.e. (""with your forhead on the floor..""). How can I see what she is doing if my face is planted in the floor!? Also, with mostly one camera angle, from the side, when she is lying down, you cannot see if her legs are apart or together and sometimes which leg she is working because she is wearing black leggings. Furthermore, you have to be at least moderately, not mildly, flexible to follow her. A little experience in ballet would have helped me too. I'm going to keep trying, maybe I will get better at it."
5,REACH! Great DVD,"This is a wonderful workout. Just recieved it and I am totally happy with my purchase. The exercise is wonderful, as well as the instructor and the entire production of the DVD. Not too choppy with the editing, has a smooth flow and has moderations for beginners, intermediates and advanced. I suggest watching this video once through first before attempting this to get a feel of the flow and the cueing (which is fantastic). Will do wonders for me, i'm sure. Enjoy..."
4,Great workout!,This is a great lower body and ab workout. Very enjoyable if you have a dance background or if you just like dancing. It is very challenging. The only drawback is that it is not a very good upper body workout. However I Do highly recommend it.
4,"Excellent book, should be in your library","Gail Ryan and Sandy Lane have been pioneers in this field and we owe them thanks for breaking hard ground which has made it easier for those of us who follow to treat sexually abusive youth(juvenile sex offenders). The chapters are separated logically and impart a great deal of information. This is not necessarily the book for the person who just wants to know more about sexually abusive youth, though it is written in a non-technical language that would be understood. It is probably too much information for someone who isn't committed to the field or committed to understand the juvenile offender, whatever their reasons."
4,"Juvenile Sexual Offending : Causes, Consequences, and Correc","This book is a little difficult to read, you can't just breze through it, but it is understandable. It helped me ease some of my worries, and to understand better what i'm getting into as i plan on entering a job working with juvenile sex offendors. It also give me a basis on how i should be responding to the juveniles."
2,A big pocket book with a hardcover,"This book is the same size as Hagar the Horrible, basically a big pocket book with a hardcover.Not the same size as the previous edition with the original strips from the 1950's.Most of these 1965 strips have been published in soft cover pocket books that go from $4 at the most, often at only $1.A bit of a rip off to me, especially since the 1965 edition sells for the same as the larger and better documented 1950's edition.They should have continued the 1950's strips with the same size, that would have been a better option"
5,"Great collection, I plan on purchasing them all","This is a great collection of every strip from 1965. It's nice to have the complete year, as I don't think some of these strips have been reprinted before. If you have other Beetle Bailey books, you will likely have a lot of duplicate daily strips but this book it still well worth it."
4,Comfortable moc,"Very soft and comfortable. Runs a little large to the size, but deserves 5 stars except for the color. I ordered the stone, but it is actually a muted green (sage). Since these were for very casual wear, a great brand and on sale at a good price, I'm happy with them.Well packed. Quick delivery."
3,Overrated,"I read so many great reviews on this but it was a waste of my money. I gave it three stars because I think the indigents are great and that this would work for people who don't have serious nail issues. However, I've been unable to grow my nails since childhood. They peel,bend and tear. I applied this twice daily for two Weeks then once daily and had zero improvement. I also hate how sticky it leaves your nails, so lint and dust cling to them unless you wash it off. Seems to defeat the purpose! I'm going to try Quimica instead."
5,Love Alive- Best in Gospel Music,"My mother bought the 8 track tape of Love Alive when I was a kid and I fell in love with it. I was very sad when she gave it away because it was like losing a friend. Some 20 years later, the songs still are some of the finest gospel music has to offer. I have come full circle now. It just doesn't get any better than this."
1,dissappionted,"i reviewed my cd mega3 i was supposed to get 3 cds only one was in the case your mega3 is very misleading and dissappionting makes me leary of ordering cds from you anymore. i had my heart set on mega3 cds, did you want someone to think that it was 3 cds in the package well you had me fooled i thought it was three good job"
1,Unsophisticated and pandering,This movie is only for those under the age of 11. I collect all things super hero and this movie is not allowed in my collection. Couldn't even watch it. Horrible low budget waste of time. FOR CHILDREN ONLY>
2,The Peoples Bible Encyclopedia & etc.,This is a scanned version of the 1912 edition. It is not really a new edition. There is some smudging of a few pages as a result of it being scanned. The maps are missing from this edition.
4,Beguiling,"Having just recently gotten hooked on Jackie, her music and her life, I found this video to be an amazing time capsule of some of her performances. My only complaint is that we aren't able to see complete performances of the pieces. Another reviewer mentioned the odd use of freeze frames, which I also found oddly disturbing. But the video is definitely worth it, if only to see her playing Iztak Stern's violin like a cello backstage and to see her working out a piece with William Pleeth. The footage of her and Barenboim is also outstanding, especially when we get to hear Jackie play a Clementi piece on the piano, Daniel at her side. The other complaint I have is that overall it's too short! I'd love to see more of Jackie and hear more interviews with her."
1,This album is an abortion.,What the hell is this? Nobody who wants to hear Dead Kennedys music will like this album. Jello Biafra should have never let this happen. I'm disgruntled.
1,"Gay, gay, and gay","This is not only the worst tribute I have ever heard, it is an insult to the Dead Kennedys music. Don't ever buy this if you are a fan of good old school punk. The band is much better than this so don't buy the tribute. Go buy ""Frankenchrist"" or ""Give me Conveniance..."" They Kick ass. And as for the bands that put this together you ought to be ashamed. This CD doesn't even deserve the one star that I gave it."
1,DONT BUY THIS CD!,"THIS VERY WELL COULD BE THE ABSOLUTE WORST TRIBUTE ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD THIS IS NOT THE WAY THE DEAD KENNEADYS SHOULD BE THEY ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE PUNK BANDS AND THIS ALBUM IS JUST DISGUSTINGLY HORRIBLE, TECHNO IS FINE BUT KEEP YOUR TECHNO OUT OF DEAD KENNEADYS SONGS"
2,Not my thing,"I didn't like this album. I into punk stuff and I also like some reggae and when I saw this CD with all the weed references and things like ""DREAD kennedys"" and ""in DUB we trust"" or the little jamaican flag on the side I expected reggae covers of Dead Kennedys songs. Instead it was this techno-industrial type thing that I'm not into, if you like that kinda thing, this cd is for you. But for all you like me, THIS IS NOT A REGGAE CD."
3,Jock O Rama!,"Covers of classics that got me to whip out my original DK albums...Not a lot of great tracks here but a pretty fresh attempt. I thought Jock-O-Rama was the best track on this album, which really stood out with the fun and subversiveness (and now with clever samples?) that brought the original so close to my heart and liver."
5,Awesome Recordings,"I have yet to get my hands on this prized boxset......if you can help, please {...} I'd be MOST appreciative. However, luckily, I do have the Shakedown, the two CD box set, El Paso Rock, Vol I and II and a few albums I picked up back in the 80's. This group has sooooooo many great songs I wouldn't know where to start. From great rock covers, their own rockers, surf music, wonderful ballads and their awesome live music, this band has it all. Anyone who loves good ole' rock and roll should pick up one of their CD's...You will certainly want to get more of it....so you might as well get a Box set!!! One of the greatest <yet for the most part, unknown> bands from the 50's and 60's that you will ever hear :) { ....}"
4,great stuff,"picked this up after repeatedly coming across Bobby Fuller's name and the sad tale of his unseemly demise. And I've been listening to it repeatedly for two weeks straight. it's tough reverb washed garage Buddy Holly, Really stripped down and with an addictive drive to it. Nary a slack cut in the bunch. got a cool surf edge too. Real straight up rock and roll. It's no wonder punk bands like the Clash and Ramones drew from it."
1,Poor value,Very small. like a toy. I was glad that I had ordered larger ones from another company. I was very disappointed. This was not a good purchase and I would not recommend them to anyone else.
3,Just okay,"These are pretty tiny. Definitely the right size for a toddler. Not exactly what I was looking for, but they will do."
1,"The M.O, of my disapiontment","I was shocked. This was a low end movie. Low end acting. Low end plot. Shoot, even the stealing of the idea was low end. Yes, this was hailed a ""Gayer Death Trap"" but I hardly saw anything that was as thrilling or suspenseful as that movie was. Maybe it was so ""hailed"" because of all the implied sex with hints of nudity, but I'm not hailing any part of it. The actors were good looking but their acting was devoid of any real emotion or charisma.What a waste of time. I rented it... thank goodness..."
1,What was that all about?,"Ludicrous thriller with an incomprehensible plot. (Something to do with drugs and stealing some guy's money, I think.) This one has everything: bad acting, bad dialogue, bad songs. At least David Christopher gets to play a performance artist who spouts bad poetry. So in those scenes he does a good job. He gets to play a man who is a bad actor. Talk about typecasting!"
1,This movie is a train wreck!,"I was dismayed by the way this movie lurched on to an unpredictable, but incredibly unsatisfying ending! I thought the premise sounded intruiging so I rented it, and am thankful I had not bought it.The movie started out with promise, but quickly I found myself thinking no couple would endure what is going on. AND when the movie took a right turn (I am trying not to be a spoiler here), I found the actions being taken completely unbelievable and the ending was a total shocker (and not in a good way).Sadly, I wanted to like this film. It does have some good things going for it, but in the end, I cannot recommend this movie."
2,Depends on your taste,"I bought this DVD because of the mostly positive reviews. I now suspect that many of these are written by friends of the film-makers. In any event, I tend to like low-budget, independent films for telling stories Hollywood won't. Yes, the production and sound quality is poor/low-budget, the plot somewhat intriguing, while the acting was mostly poor-to-fair. There is potential in this story for a really good suspense film; however, the finished product falls far short. Rent before buying to see if this film is to your taste. I was disappointed."
3,Interesting,OK this is not a big budget film....it is not glossy and slick...it is raw. It IS a drama....albeit a bit campy at times....which actually lends to it's appeal. It is well acted for the most part with some interesting turns and twists. I had to watch it several times. Each time a new facet was uncovered. All in all it is an interesting film worth watching.
1,Disappointed.,"I have a friend from France who is a diehard Kelly Family fan and was very, very excited about this release. Paddy was always her favorite singer. I remember when this came out she told me she thought it was really awful and recommended I never waste my money on it. I'm disappointed in myself for not listening to her advice. Several weeks have passed since I ordered it and I have not even been remotely tempted to play it since the third spin (I always give a new cd a few listens to make sure I'm not just having a bad initial reaction). There really aren't any catchy songs here. There is strong religious content and Mr. Kelly has done some self discovery it seems... but that doesn't necessarily make for a good album. The lyrics are fairly strong, hence the 1 star, but the vocal delivery and melodies are... not memorable. There is also A LOT of repetition with lines in choruses. I mean one line over and over (I understand choruses repeat! lol). I'm in hopes of a better second solo disc."
2,simplistic and dull,"The book contains all the elements for a nice legal thriller but somehow it never takes off. The characters are flat and the plot is so simple that already after one third of the book it is absolutely clear what happend. The relationships between the characters are all of the black and white type. Either they are very nice or they are complete idiots like the judge and the managing partner of the company. The personal relationship between wife and husband is of a similar type; they love each other dearly, but five minutes within the first row the man wants to book a marriage counsellor... All in all, not recomended reading."
5,I'm in awe of the power of pets to heal our hearts and souls,"Once in a lifetime a book comes along that makes you think, ""The authors had ME in mind when they wrote this book!"" That's the way I felt after reading the very first story in this book; then I couldn't put in down.The stories in Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul were so vivid, so powerful, so real, that I was swept off of my ""emotional feet"" by reading them. I immediately ordered a dozen copies so that I could give a heartfelt gift to all my friends and coworkers who were rabid pet lovers just like me."
5,My diary,This was a total diary of my life. It made me feel like hugging my dogs and not letting go. This book was so exciting I never wanted to put it down. Through good times and bad times pets always come through. It is easy for anyone to read and once you'll read it you will never put it down
4,The Book and The Pets,Chicken Soup For The Pet Lovers Soul was a really good book.I love animals. I love reading about animals. This book was just the right book. The book just about made me cry sometimes. One of my favorite ones was about a boy who went to a camp and when he came back the next door neighbors dog had killed his dog that he was veryclose to.I think that if people love animals and love to read about them that this is just the perfect book to read.
4,Chicken Soup for the Pet Lovers Soul,I am still reading the book and I like it alot. I love stories about pets since I have quite a few of my own
5,This is a book about the true bond between pet lovers and pe,This is a very good book. Filled with stories happy and sad alike. I recommend this book to a person who's been looking for the true stories of the bond between human and animal.
2,chicken soup books,"The book arrived in good shape but it took 2 weeks before I recieved it. I also ordered a second book from another vendor and it was here in just a short time, both were ordered the same night on the same order but it took an additional week or more before this one arrived."
5,ITS A GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!,I just purchased CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE PET LOVERS SOUL at Border's(a book) store. Just a few days ago. I just finished reading the book yesterday and I thought it was and excellent book. It's filled with heartwarming stories that I loved and I was touched by some of them. I reccomend this book to anyone who loves pets as much as I do. I'm in love with dogs an that is one reason why i bought this book. But really it is a great book.vIf yyou buy this book enjoy!!
5,Auto meter Vaccum,Product has arrived without any problems in the timing agreed.Amazon's scheme to know if tha parts fits your car is very precise. Really liked.
3,"Solid construction, but adjustment could use work","This pepper mill is well made with solid cherry construction and is very attractive to display. It grinds well and is relatively easy to refill, but I am bit disappointed with the method of adjusting the grind. The way this works is by turning the small metal nut at the top of the mill. Tightening the nut makes for a finer grind, loosening it coarser.The problem is that the nut tends to slip during use and the grind gradually changes. I find that I have to keep adjusting it to maintain any kind of consistency to the grind. The bottom of the nut has ridges on it which are supposed to lock into a ridged plastic piece in the wooden cap, but it doesn't really seem to work as well as I had hoped."
2,Largely labeled,"based on the picture, you would not know - at least I didnt, that the logo of the company, Vic Firth, is engraved on the bottom part of the mill (not underneath) and then pressed in bright white. I was a little surprized by it and since my purpose was to use it in a coffee shop, I returned it since it was branded so boldly. I'm sure it won't bother most people but it did not suit me so I returned it. It was really pretty besided the white, engraved branding."
4,Good for the money,"I like the weight and feel of this grinder. It's finish is sleek and sure beats the store-bought throwaway grinders. I'm not used to the tension adjustment since I was using a cheepie so sometimes I send out pepper that's too corse. I'm sure I am just in a learning curve, though the knob seems looser than I thought it might be."
2,Mismatched,"Wrong color/ the two ""Cinnabar color"" salt and pepper mills didn't match each other at all! One was cherry red and the other was Cinnabar...wrong color match"
2,picture book,"There are alot of pictures of Cathedrals but I would have liked a description next to the picture. There are descriptions at the end of the book which I didn't find until I had finished.Some where it was mentioned that it would be good to read this before reading Pillars of the Earth. That probably is true. However I read Pillars of the Earth first so this was a repeat for me, therefore I was only mildly interested in this book."
3,not in good condition,"We met the author of this book and were interested in getting a copy since the recipes looked great. Only used paperbacks were offered by sellers, but since the description said the book was in good condition, we ordered it. The book is quite soiled and ""dog-eared"". Luckily all the pages were in the book so we can at least enjoy the recipes."
5,Great!,"This is a top rate for any die hard fan! It includes working tapes, demos, and master sessions, including IN A TURKISH TOWN in its original form!"
2,Be Very Warned,"This has a lot of sexuality and violence, although just about all of the sexuality and violence are commonplace events on a farm or ranch. Most children would be disturbed at some of the goings on of everyday farmlife, but your child, if exposed to intimate animal life, may not be. It might be wise, however, to be cautious in allowing just any child to read this book. I'd put the book in a 16+ age group with the average, every day suburbia or city child in mind.Ken's father is a blunt, self-reliant, swearing military man. There are many instances of him cursing.Alcohol, tobacco, and smoking throughout the book."
3,flicka,The merchant was on time shipping the book `My Friend Flicka` and it was packaged ok. I knew it was used and it did arrive used which I did some repair before giving it to my granddaughter. There was no book cover but the merchant did as promised.
3,Didn't meet expectations,"I looked forward to reading this book for sometime. It is a short read, and the author is a member of the LDS church, which I have a strong foundation with as well. It did seem he was grasping for straws with one of his chapters regarding Moroni and the ""golden pot"".But his points about the priesthood restoration and Witnesses of the Golden plates seemed solid to me. I've investigated FAIRS critical review of this same book, and in regards to their bloated attack, they were unfair in my opinion in regards to the previously mentioned chapters."
5,Honesty at last,Bravo to Mr. Palmer. It is so rare to find an LDS author not afraid of the truth. I HIGHLY recommend this book to any LDS folks who refuse to believe what those of us in the know have been trying to say for decades: The truth has been altered to the sugar coated version you have today. Mr. Palmer has the courage to write the truth no matter how disturbing it might be to the typical Mormon.
1,Do your homework.,"Make sure to do your homework. Any who read and like Palmer's book, to be fair, ought to thoroughly read the article here:[...]Note (2-11-12): Please see my response to Robert Graves below."
5,Grant Palmer and the LDS coverup,"""Mr. Palmer is currently facing disciplinary action by the LDS church for writing about a truthful mormon history - a history containing many unsettling and even damning events. That a disciplinary court has been convened in Palmer's behalf (more than two years after the book's publication) is more damning evidence of the church's history than anything found in the pages of Grant Palmer's book"" I couldn't agree with this statment more.If the church has nothing to hide, then why this action?"
5,I didn't learn this in 29 years in the mormon church,This book was quite an eye opener to say the least. That anyone would question the veracity of the material in the book simply hasn't read it. Palmer is very careful to include references to all the material introduced. The book is outstanding and highly recommended. The church I thought I knew has a very different history and does a great job concealing it.
5,Palmer makes a devistating case,"This book presents, in stunning clarity and simplicity, new research into the origins of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The research resoundingly demonstrates that the official, church-sanctioned history is, at least, a misrepresentation, and at most, a fabrication. I highly recommend this book for all amateur scholars and historians of the Mormon Church."
1,Trust In The Lord and Lean Not In Thine Own Understanding...,"boy how quickly people seem to forget that wise counsel from the book of Proverbs chapter 3 verses 5-7. My whole review of this book lies in that scripture alone.5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.The answer is simple: If God tells you that something is true, what matters about man's reason and intelectual powers? The kinds of people who write these books are those who lack faith, and who think they are wiser than God. Be weary of such individuals."
5,Book order,I received this book right away. the description was specific but when I got the book it was above my expectations and in brand new shape. I am impressed with the timely service I received for this vendor and will used them again as well as recommend them.
4,An interesting blur of scientific fact about alcohol,"The book lifts into the hard core facts about alcolhol, caffine, drugs, and other stimulants while keeping a common sense attitude to the subject. Very interesting, especially for the college student."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!,"This so called coaching is a complete waste of time, and money. The first CD is FILLED with him telling you how great this is, rather than just showing it through the work. Then, it winds up being a lot of pranayama -- yogic breathing, and not well done at that.I returned it the day after I received it."
2,Hummm...Save your money & go to a local voice coach.,"I never made it beyond CD #1 because that was so uninteresting that I wasn't going to subject myself to further rambling. The ""coach"" does LOTS of name dropping & just giving examples. During the whole of CD #1, he gave about 2 mins. of actual work for you to try. The rest was just listening to him speak about...him. I would save my money and go to your local voice coach. I think you will be much better off. If one is not listed in your phone book, try your local high school music teachers (they give private lessons after school to make extra money). You can also try a local community college or church music director. Go for live help, not CD. Besides, an actual person can help you with specific areas where a CD just keeps repeating itself. I hope this helped..."
1,The Very Best of James Galway,I listen to the CD on a daily basis.My toddler grand daughters ( 3 and 3 1/2 ) love to listen to it with me.Future James Galway subscribers.
1,Not for the serious flautist,"Most of the tracks on this CD consist of saccharine fluff, such as Disney, show-tunes, etc. If I buy a flute recording, I want to hear some serious music, not this ghastly schmaltz. And I hate to say it, I'm not a huge fan of Galway's playing style. It's too light and airy, just on the edge of going into overtones. He overuses his vibrato, especially on the higher notes. When you want them to just smoothly soar with rich tone, they just sort of flutter about. He does have impeccable technique and speed, but his tone leaves a lot to be desired, in my opinion. Seek out another artist!"
2,"Brings up crucial issues, but is too superficial","Finally! Someone actually writes about the fact that therapy does not work much of the time, and that many therapists just cannot do therapy (many are too screwed up themselves). With that said, however, Masson, unfortunately, is very Angry throughout this book; he is just not distanced enough in many of the chapters. I suspect that he is upset that he had to leave his ""chosen career"".In addition, he is too superficial about many of the points he raises; there doesn't seem to be much analysis. He just states his opinion; and that's about it. This is a true shame. He raises an important issue; there is a real need for someone to write a good, deep analysis about why therapy doesn't work for so many people, why so many therapists are disturbed themselves, and where consumers who are suffering mentally can seek real help."
3,A critic without alternatives,"First of all, I like Massons book very much. His exposure of therapeutic abuse is excellent. Freud, Jung, Pearls, not to mention people like Rosen and Bettelheim, are thoroughly exposed. But when Masson claim that these abuses are an integrated part of the very method of psychotherapy he just can't prove it. Massons alternative to psychotherapy seems to be self-help groups where people talk to each other without ""experts"" involved. But those who have been a part of such groups surely know that one of the main things that are discussed there is how you can get the best therapist....In short - Massons criticism is fine; his alternative is not an alternative at all. Unfortunately, in this world psychotherapy is necessary, whether Masson likes it or not...."
2,Sturgis Uncensored,"I hope there are better Sturgis Videos out there. I bought thisvideo and was disappointed,I wanted more scenes of the tourist sites and the rides. This video spends too much time with sloppy drunks. I don't like talking to sloppy drunks much lesswatching them on video. The few rides shown were OK, but thenyou go to another sloppy drunk for an interview. The T&A; contestat Buffalo Chip was OK. Save your money on this one."
3,"Should be more about the motorcycles, than the drinking","I understand the ""uncensored"" part of the DVD, but being a motorcycle enthusiast, I would have liked to see more motorcycle related event activities and less loud drunks.I really did like the Devil's Tower piece of this DVD. That was the best part for me."
1,waste of time.,"this should have been called 'sturgis girls gone wild'. There was hardly anything on the bikes. The main focus of the movie was drunkin' retards and trashy women. I understand that it's called sturgis uncensored, but damn, couldn't they have focused just a few more minutes on the bikes, and less on the retards? My wife doesn't want to go to sturgis now, after seeing this flick"
1,Waste of money....,I was hoping for clips of the Harleys in attend... but this is an amateur Z grade movie..... After watching it for 5 minutes and I discarded it in the trash can.
2,Artcore volume 3,Excellant transaction and quick delivery. The context of the book was more than what I expected.
3,Size DOES Matter!,"Although I have bought quite a few books authored by Paul Duchscherer and/or Douglas Keister, I was disappointed with the physical size of this book. It is only about 5 1/2"" x 6 1/2"" and much of the detail in the pictures is lost because of it. The print is also mini-sized and cannot be read without reading glasses for us ""vintage"" readers! (It IS, however, the perfect size for a Christmas stocking stuffer!)I also had some problems with the constant referral in the first (and only) chapter in the front of the book to note the various 48 pictures throughout the book as the different type of porches were described. It was a constant flipping back and forth of pages to see Figures 15, 28 for this or Figures 4-5, 10, 13, 15-16, and 23 for that. The text was well-written but overall this book could have been so much better..."
4,Not a bad debut from Jada {3/5 stars},"Standout tracks:JADA'S GOT A GUN, SHOW DISCIPLINE(killer collabo with Nas), KNOCK YOUSELF OUT(that beat is still crazy), WE GONNA MAKE IT, NONE OF YALL BETTA(Vintage Lox plus the beat from Premier was icing on the cake), KISS IS SPITTIN, PUT YA HANDS UP, ITS TIME I SEE YOU, WHAT YOU RIDE FOR(young wun's verse was alright), UN-HUNH(Jada takes shots at Beanie Sigel), FEEL ME etc. Filler: F***in or what(wack as hell), Im a gangsta(too generic sounding), Nasty girl(wack girle record), On my way and Cruisin(worst matchup Ive ever heard). Bottom Line: Jadakiss's debut is not that bad but some of the filler listed brings his album down a bit. Jada has a killer flow but he shows his true potential here and there and that's not good especially for a nice emcee like him."
4,J TO THA MUAH!!!,"RIGHT NOW, HES THE BEST ALL AROUND RAPPER/LYRICIST OUT..HIS DEBUT ALBUM WAS AMAZING, LIKE HE SAID TOP 5 OF THE BEST, AND THATS ON JUST ONE LP..THIS NIGGA WAS RATED TOP FIVE BEST EVA LYRICISTS AND HE LIVED UP THAT NAME.WELL MAYBE NOT TOP 5!!!"
2,Should've been a Maxi Single (Remember those?).,"ONLY 4 songs I liked: Knock Yourself Out, We Gonna Make It, Put Ya Hands Up, Kiss Is Spittin. Cd was too repetitive. Not happy I bought this. ... ..."
2,What a tragic frontpage!!,"For me this guy is one of many who can't rap, but he have occasion to recording his records, so he's doing that. I can't stand his monotonous voice (same problem with Loon and Fab, it's terrible. Knock Yourself Out is tight, but only for the beats! Other tracks are quite decent. Pointless record."
5,When Kiss Is Spittin'.......,"I bought Jadakiss album the day it came out, and till dis day I have no regrets. This album showcases Jadakiss as a top lyricist and also shows y he is the best in the Lox. Every song on this album is hot but my personal favorites are: Jadas got a gun, show dicipline, knock yourself out, we gonna make it, none of ya'll betta, put ya hands up, kiss is spittin', f***** or what, its time i see u, what u ride for, and uh huh. This album is great and if ur a fan of hardcore rap then get this album, its one of the best of the ruff ryder camps."
2,Do NOT Buy Edited...,"Jadakiss's debut album ""Kiss The Game Goodbye"" is one of the best rap cd's i own, but, the edited version is so bad that i had to give it only 2 stars. It's not that bad on songs like ""Knock Yourself Out"" and ""We Gonna Make It"" where there wasn't much cussing in the first place, but, on tracks like ""Show Discipline"" and ""Put Ya Hands Up"" it's unbearable how they block out every other word.One of the worst parts about it is that they take out 5 whole tracks, 3 of which are skits but come on, 5 TRACKS GONE! I'm not dissing Jada at all, he's an ill rapper and i think the cd is tight, it's just the i can't stand so much editing!"
1,HUH!?,"Who ever said this album is raw/hot etc.you don't know what real hiphop music is....he may sound nice, but jada's voice sounds sooo boring.if you want some real street music, check out Cormega new album The Realness or Killa Priest new album Priesthood"
4,not bad,yo finally the east come up with sumin hot. this album is cool. jada is doin is thing and it aint to bad. The track we gonna make it is probably one of the best on the album even though it is radio friendly. i'm usally all about westcoast hiphop but this album made me look at the east in a diffrent light. Definetly worth a look.
3,ITS NOT JADA THAT HIS BEST,THE CD WAS KOOL BUT IT THE SAMETHING STUFF OVER AND OVER . JADA ONLY RAPS ABOUT GUN AND SOME MODEL HES DOING. ITS NOT WORTH BUYING. HOPEFULLYN JADA CAN COME UP SOMETHING BETTER FOR HIS SECOND ABLUM CUZ HE DEBUT JUST BLOWS
3,Don't believe the hype,"After all the talk about how Jadakiss is no longer a shiny suit wearing Puff Daddy disciple and now a street poet, I am really disapointed with this album. Sure Jadakiss is a talented MC, but what is he doing rapping over Timberland beats, that's not hardcore at all! The songs where Jadakiss has proper production such as the Alchemist and Dj priemier tracks, he shines. However, it is when he tries to crossover into the mainstream, it sounds corny and fake. Overall, the album is not bad, but not what I expected. If you want to hear a great street record, with beats from the Alchemist, pick up Cormega's new album called ""The Realness"", it's dope!"
2,interscope should be ashamed,"This the longest in the making, most overhyped, UNDERWHELMING hip-hop album in a long, long time! Too many jiggy beats, too many guest mc's with too little chemistry, perhaps the worst track of Timbaland's career...make this a miserable experience for anyone expecting a solid album. I hate to admit it, but Beanie Seagal's album runs cirlces around this one...if you're looking from something from the streets, that is.It get's two stars, instead of the one it deserves, just for the song with DMX..."
4,Beanie Sigel vs. JadaKiss,"When you read most peoples reviews you are going to get a one sided opinion. There either fans Beanie Sigel or Kiss . So if Jada is calling out your rapper you going to give him a bad review . Its like east and west with Tupac and Biggie . People got they opinions before they even listen . So the bottom line without all that where you from , i rep better sh$* is the cd is tight . As far as him claiming hes the best since Biggie is a long reach but he got skill . If you like gangsta you will like this cd . If you like some smooth sh@# you wont . On the song ""Nasty Girl"" he spits he wants a girl that wont give him brains but gives him knowledge . You cant deny his ability but if you like it you like it , you dont you dont . Just listen first ."
2,Kiss Jadakiss good bye.......,"Hey what can you say, its his first solo album. The problem is 9 times out of 10 any artist first album is their best.This is not what I expected. I really never felt Jadakiss and his style, but the young emcee has potential. Very skilled emcee with a nice vocabulary and word play.The production kills this album. The subject matter kills this album. The tracks are with half nice or half wack. The best track is ""Jada's Gotta Gun"" but that is sampled so it really isnt the creativity of Jada.I have to say Jada let a lot of people down with this release. It seems this album was more intended for the female audience like 95% of all other commercial hiphop albums.I dont think Jada will be around much longer. I would give him one more album and then he will be dropped. Its amazing to see that DMX hasnt been dropped from Ruff Ryder Records yet, or any of their artist for that matter."
3,couldve been better,"this cd wasnt not nearly as good as i thought it wouldve been. jadakiss came off kinda weak. don't get me wrong, jadas tight but the production messed it up. theres a few good songs on there. i cant listen to the whole cd without skipping over songs. theres some tight songs on there though. my fav tracks are 3, 5, 13, and 18. the rest were aight. this cd was mad overrated, when i read the review from the source i couldnt believe it. they gave him 4 mics!!!!! i thought it shouldve gotten 3 in there. i think he rushed this cd. he shouldve spent more time on it. hes not nearly as good as jay z or dmx."
3,it's...okay.,"...kool g. rap did this the best. it's hard to listen to an entire album that does a poor job of balancing its ""hard edge"" without humor or insight. kool g's 'live and let die' did an excellent job of pulling you into his crime sprees and sex-capades...jada kinda struggles with this....mosta the beats are pretty tight; 'knock yaself out' caught my attention and i cant hate on him for the radio friendly track 'we gonna make it', in fact that song is the one that compelled me to buy this....the guest artists on here didnt do a whole lot to improve things for me either, but i think in time jada can get it together if he can expand his lyrical content.i know he had beef with bad boy, but they mighta been a better fit for him."
5,The Hottest album out,"Yo this album by Jada kiss is the hottest album out. Nobody can touch his talent of rapping, lyrics, and his style of rapping. If you want to listen to some real life words bye this CD. I'm not saying this because he's my favorite rapper I'm saying this because I like his whole rap game.Peace"
4,JADAKISS,"Gold or Rust??? This CD is one of the games most anticipated and even though more than enough tracks were leaked via bootleg, etc.. it is still worth buying. Everyone knows that J-A-D-A now got beef M-A-C-K from the ROC and tries to put a hit on him (track# 14) but that was a weak effort compared to what Beanie spit about him he needs to come harder. All in all this CD is tight and is going to get air play but the streets are the true judges.."
5,The third book can't come too soon!,"I must say, I read this book in less than a day!!! I can't believe that this author hasn't gotten more notice. Her writing style is wonderful and her stories are truely imaginative. In ""Bloodlines of the Wolf"" we catch up with Isabelle and find out how she's been living her life for the past 33 years, since her exile from werewolf society. She has definitly grown up and matured, she isn't so annoying and naive. Her reunion with Viktor is bittersweet and very moving. The end of this book though, leaves you impatient for the final chapter of this trilogy. Kelly Gregson Plante says on her website that it is due out this year and a definite release date has not been set. I don't know how I can wait for it, I'm dying to know what becomes of Isabelle, Viktor, Antonio, Ivan and the others."
5,Tremendous information in such a small book!!,"(never reviewed a book before...) This is the best book I've ever read on discipline! Larry Tomczak is easy to read, uses personal stories, Biblical references and is to the point.He covers all areas of discipline -- including the parent's own need to discipline himself.I highly recommend this book, although it is a very difficult book to find!"
2,A bad remake of the original compilation,The old from the vaults collected by the head of Del-Fi was great and the songs riviled the tracks on Pulp Fiction.This is not the original gem but bad kitzy camp. Please bring it back Del-Fi since I lost my old copy and those are some of the few great surf songs.
5,The most important thing in music is TONE,"I have been a fan since the original release of ""Transformation, Speed of Life."" All of David's music represents soulful, insightful composition and unbelieveable musicianship. REALLY UNBELIEVEABLE MUSICIANSHIP. Every track is a keeper. This album has inspired me to turn away from ""commercial"" music and instead letting my soul breathe.My path is now clear, Thank you David Sancious and Tone."
2,Burnt out in a couple weeks,"Product arrived as advertised and price is great.However, the lifespan was very short, not even a month.It is mounted in a bubbling fish thing for my 4 year old, and perhaps the vibration from the pump shortened its lifespan, but i still would expect more."
5,Would do business again.,Item was received as advertised. It shipped timely. I would do business again. It was an overall good experience. MD
2,Try to find another source,"The S & H fees were so outrageous, I ordered two and cut my costs. Good thing, too, cuz the first one lasted about three weeks. The second one has been in use for about threee weeks since then, and I'm holding my breath. BTW, the original bulb that came with my fiber optic Christmas tree lasted FOUR YEARS. Shoddy."
1,Poor Quality Bulbs,"I bought these bulbs for my color changing Christmas ornament. The original bulb lasted three years. This one burned out after three weeks. Certainly not a bargain at any price,"
1,no sir I don't like it,This album is more noise than music. I bought it because the album artwork was interesting and I think I had heard they were recommended if you like Ministry. I have Jesus Christ Superstar unless I sold it. It is better (actual songs) but even it was cheesy.
3,visuals are great,"the visuals are excellent and the book inspired us recently as we drove thru scotland and made our itenuary as we were driving. the hotels and places to eat sections is poor and cannot compare to FROMMERS, FODORS or especially LONELY PLANET. this book should be used in addition to one of the above."
4,excellent naptime material,"On this album, Tram - a British band which Jetset compares to the groupsSmog or Low - successfully captures the essence of mellowness. All of thesongs would make excellent naptime material, and I mean that in a good sense.The use of harmonium and oboe give the songs a dreamlike, ethereal feel,while the piano and guitar melodies are pretty and very relaxing."
1,nothing new with this reprint of a 1979 book,"I have a 1979 copy of ""The Complete Guide to the Art of Moderin Cookery - Le Guide Culinaire"" by A. Escoffier and translated by H.L. Cracknell and R.J. Kaufmann published in the UK by Mandarin (then part of William Heinemann/Reed Consumer Books), the paperback was published in 1995.So I do not know how Wiley is claiming that this is the FIRST compelte translation - it is just a reprint of this old title.Save your money if you already have an Escoffier as there is nothing new."
4,Print on Demand,"Ok, I admit it. I'm a book snob. I have a book on self-publishing and several more books on typography, book design and presentation. I even started hand drawing my own font. I prefer LaTeX over InDesign and I notoriously evaluate every book cover I find. With that in mind, I am dreadfully disappointed in Wiley.The first several pages: Table of Contents, Introductions, Weights and Measurements Conversion are grand. It's in a nice font and it is well printed. Then we reach Chapter One.The print quality has needs only a Rabbi can fix. It's a low resolution print-on-demand quagmire of embarrassment. There is pixilation of both the black and the red inks. Some of the pages are printed near-bold while others are starved of toner.For a book like this, with regard to both the hardcover price and the content, it was a shock to peruse. I am grateful for the content but not the presentation."
5,excellent reading,"absolutely awesome delivery time, ordered and received it 3 days later...book in excellent condition, all pages are there and for anyone in culinary school, this is a must have! i would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know where the culinary industry truly began..."
2,Textbook Not a Cookbook,This is not a book for the typical home cook. It is basically a dictionary of classical dishes. The recipes are cryptic - there are no measurements to follow. It can be frustrating at times to put together a dish because the index is incomplete and most of the recipes refer to another recipe somewhere else in the book (which is then difficult to find). Does anyone really cook this way anymore any way? Tons of butter and cream - classical French. This book was used as the Text for a Classical Cuisine class at our Community College and 80% of the students sold it back to the bookstore once the semester ended.
1,A Copy,"Most of this material is taken from a couple of chapters in the book ""A Beginner's Guide to Intercession"" written by the same author. The material is embellished with a couple of anecdotes about how the author prayed that George W. Bush would be elected president which really doesn't have anything to do with the topic anyway. It would have been much more relevant to have included examples of prayers for lost loved ones.To the person who is interested in praying for lost loved ones, a great book to get would be ""The Beginner's Guide to Intercession"" by the same author. That is an awesome book that provides solid biblical principles for prayer in all circumstances."
5,STOP! BUY THIS BOOK! CHANGE A LIFE! PRICELESS!,"This book really was the answer to my prayers during a time when my lost loved ones could not afford for me to give up on them or even be discouraged! Coming from a long line of alcoholics on BOTH sides of my family, I know how it feels to get discouraged when there are so many people to pray for. I know how it feels when you have been praying for the same people for years without seeing results. I read this book and found new encouragement which I believe will literally change the eternity of many souls - priceless. I appreciate this author because I, too, have a burden for America. I read this book, made a list of the prayers and scriptures as I went through and I now go through that list everyday for the ones I love. I believe if every Christian owned and practiced this book, America and the whole world could be united under God. You can read it in one day; do your part! Let's put this on the national best seller list and see America change!"
5,How To Pray For Lost Loved Ones,This book is very helpful at a time when it is so important to be effectively praying. The references to Bush's campaign are a bit off putting but look past that because the help is there. I may not agree with his politics but I sure appreciate his help.
5,A must read for everyone who has unsaved loved ones (and who doesn't?)!,"Dutch Sheets is one of the best authors/prophets/men of God of our day!This book is a KEY to tearing down strongholds for others/on their behalf, in order to bring them to the knowledge of Christ for their ultimate salvation.After many years of concern, but only a very short time after fasting & praying fervently [and now accurately] for my unsaved family, the entire extended family/clan came to my spirit-filled church and went forward for prayer! Walls came down, and eternity was forever affected! Praise the Lord!This is a must-read!!"
5,Vital understanding of praying specific prayer for others,"This book brought Bible verses forward in such a way that i realize GOD, who is who he says he is and God can do what he says he can do, gave us clear instructions how to use prayer with the Holy Spirit to pray for others specific needs with intercessory prayer. This is an awesome journey."
5,"Gene Autry Collection, Vol. 2","These are GREAT! We are definitely Roy Rogers fans, but these films were very entertaining and well done. We were looking to purchase other 4 pack volumes but the prices were sky high! Anyway, buy these, you will not regret it."
4,BLESS THE BEASTS & CHILDREN,I finally had the chance to watch it. It brought back memories of when I first saw the movie. Kids today should watch it because the children back when this movie was made still had family problems and bullying which was not taken seriously. I watched it with my 11 year old grandson and my 43 year old daughter.
2,hmm...,"um...disturbed much? Well...I was checking this out to see the cast list, and I must say, the book is much much better than the movie. I just gave it two stars because the movie seems more interesting when you watch it with a bunch of classmates, who suddenly become critics when the movie doesn't follow the book. And the theme song's annoying. Teft and Lally 1 are real ugly. Plus there's the matter of Cotton's voice and hair. He's supposed to be a redhead. And in the movie it's brown. Brown. Huh. Also this movie contained a lot of unnecessary parts that didn't even have anything similar to them in the book! They won't be specified."
3,Did the trick,"After only a few weeks one of the lights may have died, but the others are still working. The bad one may be the fixture, not the bulb."
4,Compatible,I bought this bulb as a replacement for one of the houses in my Christmas village and it worked perfectly.
1,Burned out in a week.,Plugged into optical Christmas cottage. Lasted maybe a week. I am not happy about it. Maybe they do not make things that last anymore.
1,Bulb burned out way too soon,Ordered this to replace bulb in a xmas building that depends on fiber optics. But is only lasted a few hours. I ordered two of these bulbs and will have to see if the other one lasts.
1,short life span,I don't know if I got a bad bulb or what but the thing only lasted about 3 weeks. My previous bulb from a different vendor lasted a couple of years.
1,Don't bother,"This book is nothing but a set of photographs, very thin in content. Not useful if you are looking for comprehensive history or drawings pertaining to the planning for the project or events."
3,Worth Having for George's Music Videos,"George Harrison's ""Dark Horse Years"" DVD does not deliver value for money in terms of overall content. However, it's great to have a commercial release of George's music videos, especially ""This Song,"" ""Crackerbox Palace,"" ""Got My Mind Set on You"" and ""When We Was Fab."" The performance clips from Japan are memorable, yet one wishes the disc included the entire 1992 concert - and we certainly could have done without the ""Shanghai Surprise"" promo. ""Dark Horse Years"" is a mixed bag, but recommended to Harrison fans for the long-overdue music videos."
4,I wish I could give it five stars,"I am a HUGE fan of George Harrison and was thrilled when I learned of this DVD. The content is worth five stars. The reason the DVD is not is because of the length. Several clips of interviews shown which have clearly been editted. It would have been so much better if the whole interview had been covered. I also agree with the other reviewers who stated the concert sequence was great, but a tease for more. It would have been five plus stars if it had included the Wilburys."
3,A Rip Off for loyal Harrison fans.,"I like the DVD, in spite of all the material that wasn't included, but it was supposed to be a BONUS for buying the overpriced box set. I already have all of George's stuff on vinyl and CD. I could have bought all the remastered CDs for half of what the boxed set cost, but I forked over my money once again to get the Bonus DVD. Now they sell it individually? It's a slap in the face for the diehard fans.If you didn't buy the boxed Harrison collection, get the DVD. I think they should give those of us who bught the box set a refund. It was bad enough getting ripped off by Capitol when they butchered the Beatles albums in the U.S., now Dark Horse is ripping the fans off? Shame."
2,Been waiting a long time.......still waiting!!!!,"This is a very weak release!!! The interviews and/or commentary between videos are just OK but, this DVD is lacking content!!! There is not that much here at all!! What about a release of the full Japan show or some other concert????"
4,THE DARK HORSE YEARS,"The Dark Horse Years does have its moments of interest. The live performance clips from Japan have to be a major high point in this collection, though the few videos from that tour makes one long for a full DVD release of the concert. Maybe at some point that will happen. And the collection of music videos from his Dark Horse albums are fun to see again. Why, however, were the videos of ""Blow Away"", and ""All Those Years Ago"" not also included? It is good hearing George talk about his music also throughout portions of the disc. Still, a fitting artifact in reminiscing about a music legend."
5,George is with God,Buy this DVD of a man who is closer to God than all of us!A musical giant of the century.
2,Domination of the Editor,"The first three Draka books, sadly out of print, are combined in this volume. However, the editor played havoc with the content of the original works. Noticably absent are the appendices. Fortunately they are on the Internet at various sites. I also found gaping holes where the editor cut out entire scenes from the books. While The Domination is a wonderful chance for the new reader to enjoy the Draka setting, for those of us who read the originals, it is truly a disappointment. The editors took three great works and, if not ruined them, then certainly maimed them."
4,INTENSE ALTERNATIVE HISTORY,"This is the first Stirling novel (actually a trilogy) I have read. I found it interesting and one of the most intense books I have read. It was hard to put down at times, then hard to keep reading at others. The premise of the Domination of the Draka and the Draka's rise to power encompasing the globe is a good one. The general timeline takes the reader from a Euroasian War (somewhat like WWII) to the near future. One of the most interesting things to me was how technology was ""quickened"" because of the constant drive to stay ahead between the Draka and the Alliance led by the United States. The characters are vivid and sometimes disturbing, Draka and the freedom seeking Alliance alike. I recommend it, but be ready for an intense ride ."
2,Ratio of new ideas to pages : 0.001,"Dear Sir,I bought your books because they started so well, with a good historical twist.But as I was reading your different books, I kept thinking : OK, this is basically the same idea as that in the book I have finished. Anything new ? Nope !Moreover, the treatment of the Europeans is plainly degrading, sutpid and not plausible. The Drakka could not have extended their empire in Africa so much in the late 19th century because France and the United Kingdom were already there and would have reacted strongly if the Drakka had moved."
3,Stirling doing Stirling,"Stirling definitely doing Stirling here. Of course the subject matter have many 'grimace' moments, but a good read none the less. As always am glad to pick up trilogies/series in compendium format... tho the lack of appendix's and maps are a serious drawback."
3,They left several parts out.,"While, I own all of the series in paperback, and bought the combined hardback inorder to preserve my orginals, I bought it knowning that the in between chapter inserts had be removed.However, I did not realize that the editor also pinched and cut several parts out of each book. While the new reader will not miss them and the cut part's do not alter the overall story, the experinced reader who knows the prior books will find them selves wondering where the missing parts are. I had to go back and look up the orginal works to figure out why and what I was missing. Thinking that I was losing my mind!I hope in the future that these left out sections will be replaced and the editors will take a little more care.I did enjoy the new inserts that linked the chapters and hinted at a (FINALLY) new book.I rated this a three, would have been higher if'n the missing parts and exclusions were not so obvious."
4,Excellent military sf for people who don`t like military s,"I don`t normally read military sf,but I REALLY enjoyed this book,regardless of if the alternate history was plausible or not.The characters were real and the setting was vivid.I did dot like the DRAKA by the end ,but I DID UNDERSTAND THEM."
4,Oldy but goody,"I've had my FD91 for over two years and have taken thousands of images. The camera is bulky and heavy, but with 14x zoom it outperforms most others. Sony Steadyshot feature is great for the long lens.Images are good. Some will have the jaggies, but color is great. Now being outdone by new megapixel cameras."
2,too old,I bought this camera thinking it was a current model. It turns It out to be very old and near obsolete. This reenforces the the rule of buyer beware.
5,Great camera for capturing memories in todays world!,"...this camera is great cuz the best part you take pictures are they are on floppy already so you can jus email, save or print them out instantly...no more connecting to USB port and all that hassel!...trust me its worth the price you pay! Its includes a car charger to recharge the battery if your taking a road trip...;-)...great product for college kids!!"
5,Outstanding Camera,"Easy to use, stores on floppy disks which go directly into the computer (no cables or any hassles). Creates fantastic pictures with the ability to manually set any feature you like, or use the automatic capabilities which are well designed. I use this camera now for nearly 2 years and have not used my film driven SRL Pentax any more, nor will I ever buy film again."
2,Avoid the manufactured on demand copy,"manufactured on demand version ReviewPicture, Sound quality was garbage.Lines running through out the movie, light speckles, the sounds jumps when ever the picture breaks up, so you end up missing parts of the dialogue.I really wish I had spent the extra money on the version that came in the:Action Man Collection:Action Man, Peking Blonde, The Big Game, The Day of the WolvesBut I didn't really care about the other movies.I love, The Day of the Wolves, great 70's made for TV movie, which would have gotten a 5 star had it been presented properly.I really hope this manufactured on demand garbage goes away.I will probably break down and buy the version that comes with the Action Man Collection someday."
3,Town Goes To The Dogs,"A very cool criminal caper flick.Cool 70's cars, fashions and music.Great music.A calculating capo culls the criminal classto assemble a team to pull of a big-time heist:isolate an entire small town and rip off selecttargets on payroll day, split up the dough,and then ""disappear"".The mastermind, #1, and the crew, #s 2-6,assemble at a secret training camp in the desert,the location of which and the identity of the teammembers remain unknown to all except for #1.After briefing and training, the wolf packimplements their plan.There is a subplot related to the police chiefof the unfortunate town and his family thatis well done.If you like low budget, but well-madeaction movies with a very 70's attitude,then you will like this one."
4,A True Classic from the 70's,"I've been looking for this film since 35 years ago. I remember having watched it whean I was 8 years old and been fascinated by its original premise. The ending, in particular, is a complete knockout. Of course, nostalgia is something that make many movies appear better that they seem. But ""The Day of the Wolves"" is a total rediscovery. It is a film in need of a remake."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this because my father is very hard of hearing and even with hearing aids he needs closed captioning. I did a search for videos with CC and these said they had it. They don't....now I'm stuck with westerns that he can't hear and no one else wants.
5,Worth waiting a century for,"""Therese and Lisieux"" is an iconography of Therese which has delighted her friends. A marvel of precision and incomparable photographic work, combining scholarly detail with popular appeal, it shows the friends of Therese pictures of many scenes, objects, and documents never previously available. The English text explains the significance of all the photos and places them in context. You can follow Therese month by month in this powerful visual pilgrimage through her life. Don't miss this work of art, which opens the Lisieux Carmel to all of us."
5,Art of Prayer,Most Christians have never heard of Kenneth Hagin - so let me tell you this book will chage your prayer life from hit-or-miss to 100% results every time. Get it!
3,A Bit Disappointing,"Unlike Hagin's other books, this book does not shed much light on prayer. While it is filled with many stories about prayer, it does not get into the nuts and bolts of prayer. A better book on prayer is Fred Price's ""Answer Prayer Guaranteed."""
4,Killer In The Country,"Another classic example of the brilliant country side of Jerry Lee doing what he does best, doing different & unique cover arrangements. There are some that Mum & Grandma would shudder at but I absolutely love them, carry on ""Killer""."
2,MISH MASH OF JERRY LEE,This CD is a mish mash of Jerry Lee. There are some great tracks and some very average tracks. Most importantly the volume of the CD is quite low relative to other products
5,hidden treasures,treat yourself...feast your eyes upon visually stunning undersea landscapes and creatures...browsing through this book feels like an underwater adventure.
5,Great value for your money.,I have ordered a couple of the metal fife's but this is better tuned and much better value. Very durable and cheap enough to have two if one does brake. It would be really good if this model came out with 10 holes through.Great Xmas present for any kid even the big ones.
2,Unique fingering is not helpful,"The unique fingering on this instrument is not helpful. True recorder fingering would have produced clearer pitches, and easier fingering for playing in all keys, but Yamaha decided to invent a different spacing to the holes. IF they had just used recorder fingering, they would have had a pretty good cross-blown, chromatic instrument with tried and true fingering."
2,poor sound,"I bought this fife because I am trying to learn it so I can teach it. I play flute and thought it would be easier to learn than the souvenir fife in B flat I have. The hole are in awkward spots and the tone is awful compared to the B flat. For me, it is worth the effort to learn the fingerings in a different key."
5,"Sturdy, Sounds Good, And I'm Happy","I got this for christmas and I was very pleased and now I can play quite well. I would definently get this for some one who is looking for something sturdy and easy to play. Well done, Yamaha!"
4,Awesome,Powerful reading. A must read for believers and non believers. Dr. Holmes reveal stunning truths that will enhance a belivers life.
3,summary,"It's OK. Not the best quality, but it serves its purpose. I was expecting it to be a little higher quality than what it turned out to be."
5,Torch Floor Lamp,"I love this Floor Lamp, it gives off a lot of light. The place that I put it is just the right light that I need to use to read by. A great price and delived very fast. I am sorry for taking too long for the feedback on this lamp."
4,Beach Boy Bruce in his pre-BB heyday,"Bruce Johnston, along with Terry Melcher, were the first house producers of ""teen"" music for Columbia Records' west coast region. Prior to the advent brought by the Beatles and the British Invasion, the Beach Boys/Jan & Dean sound was the model for the post-Spector music of the West Coast. Bruce and his studio buddies put together this party album which showcases his abilities to play piano and sing rock & roll, which contrasted with his then-developing role with the Beach Boys as touring bass player and singer of proto-Beach man Brian Wilson's parts. An important historical document, light on content and sound quality, but heavy on party attitude. A must for BB/J&D fans."
5,The Saga of Pappy Gunn,My father was a kid in the South Pacific in WWII. Now he has early stages demenita and remembers WWII more than what we had for breakfast. This wonderful book about an Oklahoma dust bowl depression kid that became a WWII South Pacific hero - provided my father and I hours of conversation. A gift at this time in both our lives. If your family has WWII vets I recommend this hard to find book wholeheartedly. If you collect books this is a keeper. If you are interested in Ameician History and WWII it is a must have.
2,Don't buy this puzzle,This is a very poorly made/cut puzzle. The pieces are not uniform in size. Some pieces are nearly twice the size of others. The pieces do not fit well. The layer with the picture is feeling off on many of the pieces. Ravensburger puzzles are a much better quality.
2,dogs is right,Disappointed by a re-hash of old stories by well read authors. Small comments at the End by Mr Drake don't give much color or context to the stories.
1,Very weak book.,"Overall a very weak book. With two decent stories the rst being garbage. Gene Wolf's ""Straw"" being one of the worst stories I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Save your money, if you want some excellent futuristic war stories try the warhammer 40K books."
4,Truck manual,This is a good manual if you are only doing basic repairs and know something about mechanics and common knowledge of how things work. I get a manual for all my vehicles mainly for reference. Also couldn`t beat the price.
3,"Not bad, but a little confusing.","The manual is a little difficult to follow; the references to pictures or direction is hap-hazardly placed throughout the manual making it hard to follow. It has been a help, just took me a while to play hide and seek with the placement of the instruction of it. I rate it a 3 star, simply because I am a novice and know of no other manual of its kind out in the real world. Good for a beginner I suppose."
4,"Great Book, Great Deal","I was very pleased to find this Haynes Shop Manual for my Bronco II, and I was extra pleased at the Great Price! Thanks"
2,Wrong item sent,"This was a gift. Order arrived timely. Sometime later recipient advised that the wrong book was recieved. Ordered Chilton but received Haynes. Not the same. Paperwork long gone, so can't return. Bummer."
4,Good book for do-it-yourselfers,"This manual doesn't replace a ford service manual, but it gives step by step instructions on how to fix most common problems, and a lot of tips.Since this manual applies to Ford ranger and bronco, the instructions are general and not too detailed, but once again it's okay for back yard mechanics who are looking for a little help.The wiring diagrams at the end may not be very helpful since they are 'general' and not specific to certain models/year.This manual is so cheap, there is no reason NOT to have one."
3,Could include more,"This manual could include more...It covers most of the basics, but also fails to cover a lot. When trying to troubleshoot a problem, a lot was not mentioned in this book, such as relays as an example, and it tries to cover too many models, since a lot of the procedures and location of parts were different on my truck than this book. I wish I had the money for the official ford shop manual, but any home mechanic/troubleshooter can't do without this."
4,Good Novice Automotive Help,"After reading the reviews posted on Amazon for the Chilton's book for the Bronco II, I decided to try this Hayne's book instead. I was glad I did. I found the detail diagrams insightful and the explanations easy to follow. I have done some minor automotive repairs and maintenance on my own in the past (replacing starters, alternators, changing oil), and I found the level of this book easy to follow and useful for some more challenging maintenance I needed to work on."
1,Get the real Ford Shop Manual.,"This is a basic repair manual. For example, if your wanting to work on the transmission you turn to that chapter and read something like ""do not attempt to repair a transmission. This is beyond the scope of the average home mechanic"". Well, isn't that the reason you buy a repair manual in the first place? Your much better off to order the Ford Automotive Manual for you year of Bronco II. It is the standard by which the Ford mechanics work from. The Haynes manual is just this side of being a joke.PS. It does have nice pictures however..."
2,You really wanted to figure it out yourself didn't you?,"We have a 1986 Ford Ranger 2.0L.Now if we had a bronco, or maybe a later model ranger the book might be helpful but as it is it just eeks out a blurry idea of what you need to do.I got it because I needed to fix a clutch. Not much help.It even gives completley erroneous ""helpful"" information.Let me give you one example.When you need to remove the flywheel it suggests that if it turns you can place a screwdriver in the starter opening to hold it. Nice, but there is no starter opening because that is part of the clutch housing and therefore is laying on the ground next to you. You can still put the screwdriver there if you want but other than being a good holder it will not help you with your work :)At other times it gives completely incorrect information on disassembly of parts while completely ignoring the 1985-1987 models in other key areas.I suggest trying a chilton or some other book."
4,Haynes for Rangers,"So you want to do a repair or upgrade on your truck, but aren't sure how the darn thing works... or comes apart... or where that do-hickey is located, huh? Well here you go. With a little time and comprehension, you'll be the master of your domain!"
4,The Teachers Calling,"Excellant book for people willing to learn to teach thier faith, Well written and inspirational."
2,Don't use this for Biological Applications,"I was dissappointed by this book. It has very little about applications, and more about the physics of the microscope. I find better explanations of the basic concept of CLSM at web sites of some of the microscope manufacturers like [manufacture names]..."
3,Not the best from this author,"It's obvious that Daphne du Maurier felt a powerful connection with her ancestor Mary Anne Clarke. Indeed, her characterization of Mary Anne reflects a remarkable perception, echoing both the frustrations of a woman in a world of men and foreshadowing the feminist works that would follow in the years after this novel's publication. At times skilfully, at other times awkwardly, du Maurier incorporates historical fact into the narrative. While this works well at times, there were a number of parts in the book where I felt that details were being skimped, or satisfied with merely a mention, such as the death of Mary Anne's first child. The final part of the novel, set in the House of Commons, is the book's most significant failing. It is dry, dull, and slow, depending entirely too much on dialogue. The novel seems to peter out at this point, although I felt that the final chapter was very well written. I would class this book as average."
3,OKay!,"Mary Anne was not what I expected! Much of it was very slow-moving and tiresome. After reading many of this author's other books, I find this the least-liked one."
4,"Good book, Good price.",Really just what I was looking for. A couple of easy to make projects that do not require extensive wood working knowledge. Now where is the book to motivate me into making these projects? :)Happy customer
2,not my cup of tea,It is a well written book with good instructions but I really did not see any of the project that I would want to build. I think a bit more imagination as well as some ways to dress up the projects would have made the book a bit more useful.
4,It works,"I can't decide if the computer cable sucks or if my phone is just a piece of crap (which may well be the case), but the other cables work as expected."
1,10 days and waiting for shipping arrival from BargainCell,"12.96 for shipping to San Diego seemed high but expected quick shipment. I am concerned after reading how others received quick service. No shipment tracking data yet received except an estimate of 14-17 Jan arrival, which has now passed. I will contact Amazon if no status received in next two days and order from Ebay.Go San Diego Chargers!"
2,Great Price,Wish the instructions had been better for the cable camera to computer hookup. Otherwise good value.
4,Good Cheap Accessories,"I bought these accessories primarily for the USB data cable, which works fine. I was able to load the LG driver for my phone from the CD that came with the accessories. I use BITPIM to load contacts, etc from my computer. The home charger is a plus, since I travel a lot."
1,vx8350 charger bundle,"JUNK!!! I guess for the price it was worth it but you get what what you pay for that's for sure. the USB cable was no good to me because the install disc did not have software for my phone (LG vx8350), the home charger stopped working with a couple of months and the car charger the wires stared pulling out of the plug after a few months. now for what its worth, the car charger did contine to work throughout the entire time I had it, but the quality was horrible."
3,charger,The charger is not charging the phone. Not sure if its the phone or the charger so that is why I am rating 3 stars.
3,this did not come with Software for USB cable,this usb data cable did not come with a CD. I tried to download the drivers from the internet but it still wouldn't let me download photos and now I'm ending up ordering a data card so I can download photos.
1,Not OEM. Has some issues.,"These are not OEM devices. The USB data cable works. The travel (AC) charger seems to work. The car charger did not work. Once the car charger failed, I became nervous that these devices might be of inferior quality and damage my phone.New plan. I went to the LG website, found the official LG model numbers for the two chargers, found them on Amazon, and bought them. I have received the travel charger, it is OEM, and it works. The OEM units didn't cost much more than the non-factory units and they were MUCH cheaper than the ones sold retail."
3,Get what you pay for,"The car charge broke within two uses - first use the caps popped off, the second time the wire snapped so it is unusable. The computer cable works well, I'm just VERY careful with it. The wall charger works well also, but again it is very fragile. For the price I paid, I'm happy at least 2 out of the 3 still works. Just be prepared for cheap manufacturing and it is a gamble what will hold together and what will not. But for under $2 - I would take the chance again."
1,Charger and USB Kit for LG Phone,The cables do not fit properly in the LG phone.The cd is not working correctly for my phone.
1,Computer won't recognize generic LG USB software,"Chargers work great and are a great bargain. However, the generic ""LG"" driver software that comes with the USB cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesn't have an authenticity signature. I don't know about other computers, but mine with Windows XP (SP2) won't accept it!"
2,Did not work,"The car charger never worked at all, and the wall charger stopped working in a couple of days. I am unable to comment on the usb cable because I do not believe that my husband ever used it."
4,connectors very tight.,everything in this pack works fine. the phone power charger clip was very tight for the phone. after using it for awhile i found it was fine.
2,CHEAP,"THIS WAS CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. THEY WORKED FOR A WHILE, AND SLOWLY OVER THE YEAR ALL OF THEM FAILED. I JUST THREW THEM AWAY. THE HUBBY TOLD ME NOT TO BUY THEM, LOL"
1,Good in theory - HORRIBLE IN REALITY,I bought this for my sister. She dropped the charger in it EXPLODED into a shower of pieces. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen. The USB charger didn't work at all. The car charger fell apart after 2 days. Don't buy this.
3,Phone acc,"The price was great. The ship was fast. However, the car charger broke after one use. The plastic case fell off of the charging tip. The tip will not stay in the phone."
1,"Poor quality, but works.","I have only used the usb cable so far, but it did work. The only problem that I had was unplugging it from the phone. The metal shield on the cable got stuck and I had a hard time getting the cable free from the phone. I finally did, but the metal shield stayed in the phone. I used needle nosed pliars to get it out of the phone and was able to put it back on the cable. Neither the cable or phone was damaged, but it was a little annoying.Did come with a software cd even though the description said it wasn't included.Overall, you get what you pay for. I did not want to pay the $30 for the OEM cable, so I got this one because it was cheap. It works, but just be prepared."
1,Never recieved product,Avoid anything this company sells like it was the plague! I ordered this item from them and never received it. This company does not answer their emails. I can't believe amazon would have a company like this one on their website. If I would have received the product I would have reviewed it.
3,"Cables work, USB doesn't","I was very happy with price and quality of the phone chargers, but the cd rom and usb cable did not pick up my phone, and was not recognized on my pc."
4,A pretty darn good deal,"I haven't used the cable yet, but I've used the travel charger and the car charger several times and they both work like a charm. Even if the cable doesn't work, I'll have come out way ahead."
3,"not too great, but OK","I only needed data cable, so I would been a lot happier if I could only get the data cable with much lower price. But I guess Car charger might be useful. I'll store it in my car anyway. Quality of the product is fine and the price is fair."
4,"Works, light weight.","Came in bulk packaging, work fine out of the bags. If you compare the wall charger and the original, this one's much lighter. It's really good deal for your phone, save a lot of money than getting them in the cell phone stores."
3,Does not fit a VX8550,"These items do not fit my VX8550 correctly. With a little work and ""holding yer mouth right"" you can make them fit and make them work. Still a good deal, though."
3,Works as advertised,"Everything works as expected and the package also comes with a cd of midi ringtones, which was nice. Though each cable works, none seem of extremely high quality."
5,USB cable worked great,"Haven't tried the chargers, but the USB cable worked great for a great price. Just download drivers for free from the internet and get this cheap package!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"The car charger and wall charger work fine, but look cheap....which they are. The USB cord comes with a CD, but as many others have written....i can't get my computer to even read the CD. I wonder if it's just blank. Overall.... you get what you pay for."
4,usb cable Works fine,"Haven't tried anything else besides the usb data cable. The cable works fine and has been sturdier than what some other amazon reviews I read led it out to be. I downloaded bitpim and it's been great! Though I did eventually buy a 2gig microSD for my lgvx8550, and it came with a reader rendering my data cable pretty obsolete.But since that's not the fault of cable, and also because I haven't tried the other 2 products the cable came with, I give it 4 stars."
2,car charger sucks,Cahrge charge will not completely charge your phone I have not used the computer charger yet and the wall one it ok.
1,Good for Two Charges,"I got two full charges out of the home wall charger until the charger quit working. The USB data cable just locked up my computer therefore it was worthless from the start. As of now the car charger still works but based on the wall charger history, it will probably quit working as well."
1,wrong parts,"Got extra outlet adapter for phone, but it was the wrong one. Seller was contacted. Did not make order right."
1,combo kit for lg cell phone,the only thing in this combo kit that was any good was the car charger. The rest was junk. The usb was unusable as was the ac adapter.
2,Does not fit VX900 LG EnV,"I bought this to use with the LG EnV. It didn't fit. I gave this away to a friend who had the LG Chocolate and it worked fine. So... nothing wrong with product, just the product information."
3,cheap,"This is a great product for cheap people like me.. but you do get what you pay for. The home charger works perfect, not a complicated thing. The USB cord rarely gets used and works fine. My problem is that i have bought 2 of these and the car 12v charger has either broken or doesn't quite work correctly. I cant complain much though because the price is so good that even without the car charger, its well worth it."
2,Shine Charger and Accessories,It worked really well for about two weeks then all of the stuff just stopped working around the same time.
4,Good generic (non-LG) products.,"I though I was getting official LG products, but they were generic. However, they work."
3,Pretty good for the $$,"For $2 -- you can't complain. For the USB cable alone it's worth it and throw the chargers out if you have concerns. Verizon wants $20 for the cable. The chargers do work, but the car charger connector falls out easily so you have to put it somewhere that the coiled cord won't pop it out. The AC charger also seems to work OK, but once again, the connector is a little temperamental - if you get it in securely it works.But again -- $2.00 - Came fairly quickly as well. Ordered Monday, got it Friday."
2,"Chargers work, but....","They should call this a 2 peice combo. The chargers work fine, however the USB cable and software will not work with a VX8500, or VX8600. But still a good price for the 2 chargers."
3,Usable Product for the Price..,The price for the product is great but you get what you pay for.I plugged the wall charger to my phone to make sure that it worked and the metal cap from the tip of the charger came right off with easy. The Charger still works without the cap in place on the charger tip but the phone cannot be moved one bit while charging. Not a big deal as it is only a backup charger. I tried the USB cable and the Cig Charger and they both work great. I would give 5 stars if the wall charger would not have been so cheap. I did not bother to contact the seller for a replacement wall charger as it's only a backup as I mentioned.
4,3-Piece Value Combo Pack - Great price,"This is a great value for the money. The travel charger works great as well as the Cigarette Lighter Charger. The data cable works for data transfers but does not charge the phone while it is plugged in. I had to go back to Amazon and buy another cable that had that functionallity.Otherwise, this is a great buy."
4,Good deal,"Very good deal. Just make sure that it is what you are looking for. Great cords, my only complaints are about the phone for which I bought them, LG Shine CU720"
1,disappointed,"I purchased this set of accessories primarily for the home travel charger.The home charger is nonfunctional. However I went to Dollar General and purchased an AC adaptor for the car charger component and am able to charge phone at home. The USB data cable acted like it wanted to work, I download a program it requested, but never displayed any info or pictures."
5,Chargers brought peace of mind.,"I purchased the chargers for my daughter who is in college. She lost her original charger and was not able to keep her cell phone charged. It brought great peace of mind to have the chargers, both car and home, for our daughter. We feel better knowing that she can contact us if there is an emergency. The charges came in a timely manner and were in wonderful condition. They worked perfectly, and I would highly recommend this product."
3,OK for the price,"The price for this package is very good. I inserted the USB adapter and it worked fine. But when I unplugged the USB adapter from my LG cell phone, the ground plate of the adapter plug got separated from the plug and stuck with my cell phone. I had to use a plier to pull it out of my cell phone. I then inserted in back into the plug with care. I guess the construction of the plug is not sturdy. But for the price, what more do you want?"
3,works and that is all that matters,"parts work, not made very well the parts do not fit that well but they do fit"
3,USB cable,"Product has some difficulty keeping connectivity while syncing device with computer. It is ok if it is connected and the usb cable is not touched. However, if you bump it by accident you will often lose connectivity."
3,I guess it's all right,"I knew it wouldn't be great, but I figured I'd try it instead of buying the expensive Verizon products. It seems to work (so far), but is VERY flimsy. I wasn't even sure if it would fit. The USB cable may work, but I get a warning message when I try to download the driver (provided by CD from the seller I ordered from- not sure if it's always included), and the warning strongly recommended not using a non-approved driver. So I didn't, and the USB cable won't connect my phone to the computer without it.I would only recommend getting these if you only use them as emergency back-up, not for every day use."
4,Does what I need it to,"As other reviewers have noted: these aren't OEM products. But they did all work for me. The data cable is what I most wanted, and thus it's been what I've used the most. And all have worked for me for a few weeks now.The Driver CD did not have drivers for my phone (LG VX9900 enV), at least none were indicated on the disc in any way. However, Vista automatically downloaded the correct drivers, and the cable worked just fine with BitPim. I've no experience with the cable on a non-Vista system.My only complaint (which I admit is minor) is the the phone connection on all 3 cables is quite tight. I was a bit concerned about damaging the jack on the phone when using these for the first few times (the OEM wall-charger that came with the phone was not so overly-snug). That said - can't really beat the price. I paid more in shipping than I did for the bundle (which annoys me at some level I can't explain, but oh well)."
3,Ok product for the price,"This product work good with the en-v phone but is cheeply built but for the price it was good. charger's bolth work, had to fix car charger. Software that came with usb cable did not work for my phone, but cable did work with other software."
4,Very good CD.,But the only problems is that here is no White Zombie on this CD. It's worth buying but don't expect any White Zombie like the search tells you. It has some awesome bands(Example: Biohazard) and it makes a good addition to any Headbangers collection.
3,"Nice design, poor material","I didn't realize that it was sort of thin material, semi-transparent, and not very stretchy"
4,Worth getting or renting,"This is a fine film, well made with realistic sets and characters that fit into the story line. Its well worth checking out. The only big laugh is the boats for the beach invasion, seemed a bit too based on WWII landing craft, but hey thats the least offensive thing hollywoods done to a traditional European story."
4,I thought it was good...,"it's funny, if you try to figure out if it's a good movie based on reviews (especially the ones that have bitter diatribes)then you will be misled. If you like the director and producer's work on other movies and you like the cast and your looking for a medieval story that goes as much on historial presentation as well as dramatic story lines then this is a fine movie to watch in my opinion."
5,Enjoyed every minute of it,"Sit back and relax, enjoy the movie. I read some other reviews, both good and not so good. Forget all that. Just watch the movie."
2,Yeesh. What a mess.,"""Robin Hood""--------------------------------My wife and I are both big Robin Hood fans, and think that Ridley Scott is a great (""Blade Runner"") director... But, oh my god, what a lousy movie this was. The script is terrible -- flat, preposterous, unsurprising and uninteresting at every turn. Plus, it completely warps the Robin Hood legend and denudes it of its essential character, in oh, so many ways. It's really just not a good film at all. Mildly engaging in parts, but ultimately not worth your time... And if you are a Robin Hood buff, chances are you'll really hate this film. It's pretty skippable. (Axton)"
2,"Uninspiring, Unmotivated, Typical, Predictable. NUF Said.","Those four words completely describe this movie. There's tons of movies like this, you would have thought they would at least try to add some originality.Who gave this 4-5 stars are oblivious to movies in general and should not be allowed to rate movies PERIOD. I like the main character, but this movie messed him up. It was boring as heck."
1,"Go back down under, we don't need you here....","Kevin Costner already did this perfect in 1991, no more Robin Hood remakes, we're good. I'd rather see him with a tugboat fighting 'round the world personally..."
1,Complete BS,"I'm fed up with Hollywood's politically-correct nonsense and demand some historical correctness. I will NEVER spend money for this movie! I love Kate but the idea that she is in armor and swinging a sword is ludicrous. Women in those days didn't do that sort of thing. (And please don't point to Joan of Arc, who was an aberration.) It's time to recognize that until just a few years ago women were never in this sort of position. I'll wait and take this movie from the TV, if I watch it at all."
3,"Great beginning, terrible ending","The first half of the movie was great. Suspenseful, interesting but then it began to fall apart.The battle scene was one of the most poorly executed and least suspenseful scenes I have seen in a long time. And to make matters worse it was the grand finale of the movie and it just kept going on and on. Kids on ponies as part of a battle charge? Really?"
2,As bad as it gets?,"When I learned Russell Crowe would star in a new Robin Hood movie, I felt certain that at least it could not be as bad as the Kevin Costner rendition. Russell Crowe and Robin Hood surely would equal an intelligent and exciting film. But I was wrong. The problem begins with the screenplay, which apparently is another postmodern exercise in its boring faith in its perceptions to begin anew: it is an attempt to 'imagine' what kind of actual facts might have undergirded the growth of the legend. None of it, beyond the most obvious, is particularly plausible, and it does not add up to close to a satisfying whole. Its falsifying of history is much worse than anything in the Errol Flynn movie, because that clearly is meant to be just swashbuckling fun while this wants the audience to see it as saving people from the bad history of swashbucklers. If Russell Crowe is not ashamed of being in this movie, he is not as discerning as I thought him to be."
2,Just boring,"The beginning of the movie called to mind ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" which really hurt it because the battle scenes and action just aren't that interesting in comparison. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one was because of Mark Strong. He plays the same kind of character he did in ""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Kick Ass,"" but he's very good at it. Other than that, Crowe is completely forgettable, Cate Blanchet is wasted and I wish that I hadn't wasted my time."
2,Disappointed,"I love Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, but this movie was a big disapppointment. The character of Robin Hood was too reactive and not active enough. It seems he spent most of the movie with his eyes on the ground. There was no brilliant or amazing action or dialogue. Too ho-hum, for me, and predictable. The one time the Merry Men get to rob someone, it is so dark, it's hard to tell what is happening. The really good movies, like ""Master and Commander"" you want to pull out and watch again and again. I have seen this take on Robin Hood once and it is enough."
5,Excellent!!,"The Packaging was excellent. The Movie is excellent!!!, and the Service with Amazon is just amazing, thanks. hakim"
3,"Good acting, But lakluster acdtion","There have been si many robinhood remakes, this is one of the best. It beats the Robin Hood with Kevin Costner hands down. With Russle Crowe as Robinhood and Katr Bachette as Mariam, they seem to blend well in this film. What a great ensamble of top notch actors, that made the film work, however, sadly the action scenes fell flat. It was very interesting take on Richard the LionHearted, howeer the action was slaow and tedious. I felt the movie was worth buying, just beacause I like the actors. but for action it was dissapointing. The merry man were actually merry, but it was a tempered merry. They sujng songs and danced. I thought one part of the film were the introduced some youngsters as thieves was reminiscience of the planet Ewok, from Star Wars.....Yuu'll know the scens that I am talking about when you see the movie........ Rent it first to see if you like it....I found it to be just ok..........."
3,Not the Robin Hood you expect....,"2 1/2 hours of how Robin Hood came to be. It was way too long and overall a tolerable movie at best. I was very disappointed. I'm sure ""Robin Hood II - Tha Hood's Back"" will be out in a couple of years - the actual story I wanted to see: stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, Robin the outlaw, Sheriff of Nottingham, blah blah blah...etc, etc.... Don't waste your time on this movie unless you're REALLY bored."
2,Not Ridley's best effort...,"Again comes a tale about Robin HoodThat would entertain us if it could;But 'tho loaded with starsThe tale is somewhat sparseNo wonder it was misunderstood!There is Russell and lovely Ms. CateWhich should have made the flick great;Yet Ridley missed the markWith a story lacking a sparkDon't waste your time here, mate..."
2,Fragmented,"This movie must have been written by someone who has the attention span of snail. It was like they filmed a bunch of unrelated scenes, and then decided how they could cram them all into a long, strange, mindless arrow shooting party.One strange scene, has the King of Locksley asking Russel Crowe to tell him about himself, so he might receive him as his son. Then not long after, the King is telling Crowe all about his father??? Made no sense.It was hard to understand many conversations in the movie. I think the accents were so fake, and maybe the microphone wasnt close enough, that it didnt work well.I was disapointed in the movie, and I only rented it for $1 at redbox. I wonder if they have refunds?"
3,"Drama, not action","Nothing compared to the Kevin C version. This is not a movie of a lot of action, it fact, until the final sceen, it had very little. It was an ok ""story"" and a long, drama. A lot of characters, a lot to try and follow. I expect more from Crowe, a more intense role but still overall, not the worst movie, just long drama that hopefully ends here."
5,Well Done Portraint of Robin in the Hood,"I admire the work of both Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe. They did not disappoint with this movie. Even though this was a fictional portrayal as there was probably more than one Robin Hood, I feel it is a significant historical tale that should be told time and again.."
3,Contrived,"The story did not ""invite"" me in. I did not feel that it was as good as some Robin Hood movies which I have seen before. Maybe he should just ""take a rest"" the movie felt contrived and not exciting."
4,Nice movie,"When I first saw this film at a theater, I hated it.I don't know why. Maybe the story was too common, or maybe because of my condition that day.When I watched it again in Bluray, I absolutly liked it.The ending war sequence is really well made. It can be compare to any of Ridly's epic movies such as Gladiator, Kingdom of heaven.I loved Cate Blanchett. She's never get old.Russel Crow was well matched with the charactor. He always does.The sound is well divided into 5 channels (DTS HD) and the picture is supurb.Also it has two versions -Theatrical released one and unrated extend version.Grab the bluray if you like this film."
5,Awesome,I Bought this movie for my husband and he watches it all the time. Loves all the action in it
4,Pretty good. Great if you like Russel Crowe's schtick,"I've decided I like Russel Crowe movies. Time after time he delivers good solid action that is actually driven by a reasonably compelling, albeit not overly complex, story. Between this film, Master and Commander, Gladiator, and his recent work in Les Miserables he has a penchant for films with historical interest which appeals to me.On that note, this film delivers - Good historically correct feeling battle scenes, political intrigue rooted in true history, and an ah-ha moment at the end when you realize you were watching a sort of... wait, I don't do spoilers.To wrap up, I give this movie a 4 out of 5 because it delivered on my expectations quite well. Make some popcorn, settle in for some good entertainment."
3,"OK, in a pinch","Beautiful & interesting photography, but the story might not be all up to historical facts....??? Russel Crowe (as always) keeps his stone-face and is the hero that ""saves the day"" :)"
4,Pretty good,"It wasn't what I was expecting, based upon the previews. I didn't find out till the end of the movie, that this movie was how Robin Hood got started. That is the only thing that disappointed me. The acting was great and sub plots were so entertaining!"
3,Be Careful on these reviews.,"While I was disappointed in the film - the reviews are not reviewing an ""unrated directors cut"" but for the most, if not all, are only reviewing the theatrical release.While I agree the movie has little merit the reviews have none if they are not reviewing the product.No one saw an unrated directors cut in the theater. It is only those reviews that are a value for this product."
2,Not Entertainment,Read the 1 and 2 stars and then decide if you want to see this movie. My rental fee would have been spent on a donation to charity.
5,Underrated movie,"I understand the reviewers were not kind to this movie. I have to say for an action adventure movie it delivers. The story of Robin Hood is actually and adequately written into to historical events. Predictable, a bit, but we go to the movies to turn our minds off. It a word, enjoyable."
2,Encoding Problem affecting Resume Play,"I see I'm not the only one that has noticed that the BluRay disc will not resume play after hit the stop button or some 30-sec after hitting pause.The movie is just OK. I loved Richard Crowe in some of his other movies but he simply doesn't fit this one well considering the way his role was cast. The storyline is interesting enough but the title should be ""The Making of Robin Hood"" as the movie ends with him becoming that character.The movie is too dark and doesn't do a good job revealing the visual detail the producers spent so much money on."
4,relieved,"When the disc arrived I could hear it rattling in the box so I was worried about scratches. I hated to open it since it was to be a Christmas gift, but really didn't want to give a scratched disc so I opened it. Looked it over, then watched it and it was okay. I guess this would be a problem for the original packagers. Seems that they could insert a small piece of packing foam to alleviate the problem. P.S. I enjoyed the movie but my boyfriend and grandson did not."
4,When will the sequel be made?,"A very interesting ""historical"" version! First, Richard I never spoke English! He was hit by a crossbow, but died in the arms of his mother. There was no ""French invasion"" by Phillip; the French did invade years later in John's reign when the Welsh and Scots also attacked English lands. The reference to the Barons Dispute did lead to war and then the signing of the Magna Cartr. Will the sequel focus on the heavy taxation of John to support his war? This will be central theme for ""Robin Hood Part II"" plus the First Baron's War and the loss of all land holdings of Normandy. Who will pardon and 'restore' Robin? King John died a broken and unloved failure in life. Ridley Scott will recreate English History again."
4,"Breathing New Life Into ""Robin Hood""","Despite the needlessly convoluted opening scenes, director Ridley Scott provides a vigorous, gritty spin on the Robin Hood legend. Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett make an ideal Robin and Marian for the 21st century - backed by impressive production values, a fine supporting cast (Max von Sydow and William Hurt are always welcome) and Scott's epic sweep. The 156-minute ""director's cut"" is slightly overlong yet far superior to Kevin Costner's ridiculous 1991 version. Judging by the international box-office success, do not be surprised if Crowe, Blanchett and Scott reunite for a sequel."
4,Very good,"I never saw this in theaters due to the mediocre reviews but I was glad I finally saw this movie.Having somehow never seen a preview of this movie, I viewed this film fresh and found it to be quite entertaining, with good action, an enjoyable and mostly solid story line, and good acting - leave it to Ridley Scott to come up with another film from him that rivals ""Gladitor"". I went directly to the Directors Cut and found that version to be well made without the storytelling hiccups the theatrical version seemed to have from the other reviews.Some minor critisms about this movie were that the third act seemed to be a little rushed and the movie came across a little more serious than it is perhaps intended to be. However, the film was otherwise nice to watch. Therefore, I recommend this film, especially the Dirctor's Cut for a fuller experience."
4,Robin Hood(Unrated),"Good Movie!!, though not great, but just good. I would see this movie again and would recommend to others to see."
5,Very Entertaining,"""Robin Hood Begins"". A fun prequel to a legend. Good acting, good directing, good script.Robin Hood is much more legend than historical figure; artistic liscence is welcome."
5,Hood,Great adaptation maybe better than the E Flynn version would love to see a sequel but that doesn't seem to be in Mr Crowe's DNA
1,blue ray stopped 3 times,received blu ray today. it stopped 3 times. the last time had to restart blu ray. very poor quality. i would like my money back.
1,Not the definitive version,"For every one thing that this movie gets right (no, the middle ages wasn't neat like Disneyland...) it gets something else wrong (the entire beach scene...medieval LSTs, really!?). Russell Crowe has fallen for his own publicity, and can't find a role equal to his own magnificence...Excesses will abound, and if he lives long enough he may get back to doing an excellent job on good roles. In the meantime, expect roles with realities stretched to suit his inflated ego.Just about any other version is superior...I'd even watch ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" before subjecting myself to this dog again..."
3,Nothing to write home about,"There were some definite virtues to this film: there were fairly realistic depictions of medieval life and Russel Crowe can always be counted on to make a bad movie better. Overall, however, the film is long, somewhat dull, and has several aspects of outright eye-rolling nonsense. Little boys on ponies fighting knights? Lady Marion riding into battle with full armor and a longsword in hand? (The same nonsense, by the way, that they had Blanchett pull in ""Elizabeth"") Good grief! Keep in mind, that this is not about Robin Hood per se; it is basically a prequel to the Robin Hood legend that we all know.Three stars is probably generous but Russel Crowe is one of my favorite actors.Not recommended."
3,Disappointing,"I knew not to expect Gladiator, but I was still very disappointed with this movie. The storyline about his father was really lame and did not seem to fit. Maid Marienne riding into battle wearing chain mail was a joke. The bottom line: Any Robin Hood movie where Robin uses his bow no more than 2-3 times is not a real Robin Hood movie."
3,Not as Good,"If you like me, enjoyed the earlier Kevin Costner Robin Hood, you will find the Russel Crow re-make, not up to par with the earlier one. Great acting both by Russell Crow and Cate Blanchett. However the dynamic of the movie is not as good as the Kevin Costner's one. Remember, it is still a good popcorn type of movie, but do not expect it to exceed the Kevin Costner's one."
3,VERY WATCHABLE!,"I hadn't heard anything good about this movie, but my husband wanted to see it so I ordered it from Amazon. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! We both thoroughly enjoyed it! Good performances all round, and an interesting and different perspective on the tale of Robin Hood."
5,Robin hood,"Just loved this movie. I purchased the single-disc dvd, and kind of wish I had gotten the one with all the extras. But the unrated director's cut was fantastic. This should have been the version released in theatres."
3,Robin Hood,"I liked it, watched it all the way through in one seating. I give it a three, maybe a three and a half. I liked the orginal also, Errow Flyn he was the best actor."
4,Robin Hood is a fun new take on the old story,"Let's not get too excited, this is no gladiator, however it is a fun and new take on the robin hood tale. The action is very good, the cinematography is excellent, the acting is superb, and the characters are likable if not quite realistic in some cases. A few minor plot choices mar what is otherwise a solid film. The departure from the plot of other Robin Hood movies is fresh and an interesting take on his origins. Overall, four stars."
2,A simple Review,"I really wanted to like this film. I love this genre of film, but the should have made the movie like there was not going to be a sequel.I though the film was incomplete, despite all the action. I was not able to relate to the characters...and the plot seemed directionless. It didn't hit any particular niche, making a sequel opportunity amazing, but leaving the film tiresome.It was a prequel, and it felt like they kept all the amazing literary content for the next movie.--David"
1,What a dumb story,"This movie is horrible. What a dumb story. I couldn't even watch it to the end as it was so stupid.Russel Crowe takes himself way too serious.SAVE YOURSELF!! ANY VERSION OF THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THIS ONE, EVEN THE DISNEY CARTOON.YUCK!!!!!!!"
2,Robin Hood,"First of all i would like to add that if you are going to portray a movie as close as possible to historical accuracy, then you need to be familar with some history pertaining to the Crusades. King Richard the Lion Heart was away for only 3 years, and therefore Robin longstride(Robin Hood) could not have been in the Crusades for 10 years, unless he was already in the holy land before King Richard arrived. Thank you."
2,a remake of Gladiator?,"Good picture, good sound.Every scene is transferable with Gladiator.Start both films together, one in PIP and youfind them identical. Turn the sound off and play Dark Side of the Moon(twice)"
2,Robin Hood is like Gladiator meets Braveheart with sprinkles of Robin Hood and not in a good way.,"Length:: 5:01 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews ""Robin Hood"" directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe as Robin Longstride and Cate Blanchett as Lady Marion."
1,"Pitiful, boring and lacking of any interesting plots","No character development, no decent plots, just a boring movie. I fell asleep twice during fight scenes. This movie had good actors, but a really boring script and plot.... Don't waste your money... I haven't seen a movie this bad since 9th gate, and honestly I'd rather see that again than be forced to watch Robin Hood again."
4,"if I newer watched Robin Hood movie, I would love this one more","It is a awesome movie for someone that have newer seen any Robin Hood movies. It has a nice plot and it is filmed really good, but for someone who have seen so many RH movies, it is too far away from any of the old ones before. Good movie but not something I expected from Robin Hood movie."
1,Mostly Special Effects - Bad Script,"I watched this movie because a so-called medieval expert said the sets were authentic. I wonder if he was talking about the Norman assault craft modeled after WWII Higgins boats with drop-down bow ramps. Even the action and special effects were disappointing, where close-in combat is so murky, chaotic and confused it's impossible to follow who is getting whacked. But the greatest disappointment was the script, so bad I don't know where to begin. Couldn't the writers have made a stab at historical verisimilitude? Big epics like this cover a multitude of sins, the worst being the relentless resort to cliche. It's hard to believe this is the same Ridley Scott who produced ""The Good Wife."""
1,Can't take the editing,"I could not stand the constant 5 second editing that existed soley for the purpose of disguising the fact that 90% of this movie was ""filmed"" on a computer."
2,Not so much,"This is a good story. And it's a good movie.But it has nothing to do with Robin Hood. They use the names, they use the places; but they don't care about history, people or events. If you care about the Robin Hood stories, this will not be a good idea to buy."
2,Robin Hood Begins!!!,"The only other Robin Hood movie I've ever seen was the parody directed by Mel Brooks. I couldn't compare it to the previous films, but I understand this is a retelling of how Robin came to be who he was. It feels like an epic film, but it was very boring and drags on a few scenes. There are some intense battle sequences, and some humor. Crowe stars as Robin Longstride, a highly skilled archer who helps fight in battles, along with his 'merry men' Sir Godfrey sends his army to attack the people of Nottingham. At first, Lady Marion doesn't trust Robin, but she soon warms up to him. If you are a hardcore English folklore fan, then you'll probably love ROBIN HOOD!!!"
5,Great Movie and Extensive Bonus Features,I admit oprah spilled the beans on some of the bonus featured but very liitle lol - I want to start off by talking the bonus features extensive and great - I was part of behind the scenes and learned alot . I love this version of Robin Hood as I did not like costner's. The packaging of the blu ray/dvd is gorgeous - if u love the movie and have or will get a blu Ray player - this is a must have.
5,Great movie - Great actor,Saw it on TV. Bought the disc. Viewed it twice. Best movie Crowe ever made. Neat twist on the old Robin Hood plot
5,Violence is historically accurate.,"I appreciate that romance can be done well w/o relying on sex scenes. Good values, good action, and horses too."
4,"long, slow, but more serious than 90s Robin Hood","I'm a big fan of ""Robin Hood and the Prince of Thieves"", so I was excited to see a different telling of this story. This version is much longer and slower than the other one. However, I believe it's a far more realistic portrayal than the 90s version. As always, Crowe shines as the dark and moody warrior he is somewhat typecast as since Gladiator, in stark contrast to Costner's noble, nothing-bad-can-happen-to-me, I-don't-have-an-English-accent character.In short, if you want something that is a more accurate portrayal of the legend and time period and don't mind some slow spots, then check this out."
3,Some things you should know,"I was very appreciative of the grand way in which Ridley Scott told this story, but it was rather bothersome to hear them speak about Richard the Lionhearted by calling the crusades ""his crusades"". Scott throws in a scene where the Robin is talking about killing women and children at some battle, and how the muslims only looked on the english with pity, as though they are above savage actions.This added a political tinge that i felt was un necessary, and coupled with the free to be you and ""lesson"" that robin gives everyone, and the very hippie-ish ending, i found that this went from an entertaining film to some kind of lesson.For historical accuracy i will up my rating of 3 stars to 4, but for that preachiness i spoke about prior i lower it back to 3. Worth watching all in all"
1,Russel Crowe Glory-Fest,"This is yet another movie where Russel Crowe attempts to recapture glory from the likes of Gladiator. In fact, this movie blatantly copies Gladiator, Braveheart, and even Saving Private Ryan in one scene. His character is basically interchangeable between Gladiator and this; so IE - he is not acting, simply ""being himself on camera"". The part of his movie that were actually good are the scenery, sets, and costumes. But the plot? Or vacuous lack thereof? Forget it. Crowe plays a genuinely annoying/brash/arrogant version of Robin Hood, and I'd even argue that he acts nothing like any Robin Hood ever; not Errol Flynn nor Kevin Costner. For Russel Crowe fans only."
1,wretched movie,I did not find this movie entertaining and I confess I gave up about half way through.The script was certainly the worst part of the film.Give me Errol Flynn!
1,Horrible. Simply a huge dissapointment.,"I love Ridley Scott. He sold out. When Maid Marion is required to don armor and fight in a huge battle, we have gone off the politically correct waterfall. Do not waste your time or money. Buy the original with Erroyl Flynn and be done with it. Shame on Scott."
2,Kai Anderson Go Step works for Beginners,I thought that it would be for more beginners. It would taking it slow and then getting a little faster. It was med fast and hard to work with.This was not for beginners it was for person that have done this before and just can start all over.Kari Anderson is fine just not for the BEGINNER that has not worked out for a while.
2,Average feedback for this dvd,Average. For someone who has never done step it moves very very quickly. Also found it confusing when the instructor didn't say they were heading left or right as because you are watching it on TV it is all back to front so can be tricky and easy to get out of sync.
2,not for beginners,"I bought this because i love step aerobics, but have not done them in years. What attracted me to this was that it claimed to be for beginners and had gotten good reviews. What i found is that the only ""bad"" review i read, was accurate. If you have not been working out prior to this video and in good cardio condition, you will find this cd to be too challenging.The tempo is quite fast for beginners, the moves are not all that simple either. She gives bad cueing, and no examples before she just switches moves. I don't know of any other video that she has created, but this one is not for beginners, and it seems that she forgot that true beginners are not in shape."
2,Not really for beginners!,"I purchased this dvd because it said it was for beginners. I used to do a step workout daily, about 15 years ago and loved it. I wanted to start doing my step workout again, so I thought I would try this dvd. When I actually tried the workout, the moves were not for beginners. They show one person who is doing the workout that is not on the step, but doing the workout on the floor. What a waste to time! I was very disappointed! I thought the moves would be easier since it said it was for beginners. Try checking this one out at your local library before you buy this one, I wish I did."
4,Fun Advanced Beginner Workout,"I would agree with the other reviewers that said this is not as beginner-oriented a workout as implied, primarily because of the lower leg flipping choreography in the second half. It has less complicated and easier to learn stepping routines than other videos of Kari Anderson's, but it's not as basic as say, many of Kathy Smith's or Denise Austin's basic routines. I consider myself intermediate as a stepper and I really like this video. It seems laid back compared to Kari's usual complicated routines, but I often think about issues on my mind while exercising to well-known favorites, and this is becoming one."
5,Love it!,"I love this workout. As a beginner, this was easy to follow and not master by any means. Every time go through this workout, I get more fluid. I also really like how she instructs. She is clear, kind, and keeps a humane pace."
4,"Great workout, but has dance moves that don't fit a beginner","Was surprised how good a workout this is! I am in my mid fifties and don't want alot of high impact moves, but still want something that will get my heart pumping. The first part is great, simple but gets you going even for an intermediate level. Don't like the 2nd part where the moves are a little more complicated and dancelike. As someone else mentioned, the first workout doesn't get boring as there is enough variety to keep you going. She does a very good job at instruction."
1,Beginners?,"What a disappointment to get something I can't use. This is for intermediates to say the least. Of course Kari Anderson is at fault, not Amazon."
4,Excellent - Maybe Intermediate,"I like this workout. The choreography is simple, but it doesn't get boring, and I get a full workout. Kari does not do endless repetitions of the same exact move, which I like. I do not like to do more than 4 of any move in a row. The music is good and Kari is cheerful, and encouraging without being obnoxiously chipper.While the choreography is simple, you might have difficulty if you've never done step before.I recommend Gin Millers ""Everybody Steps"" for the true novice. Gin explains and breaks down every move, then repeats it a lot."
4,Great introduction to step,"I did step aerobics all the time in high school. I recently started it again and this dvd was a great way to get back into it. The thought of doing a video that had a dance feel was a little daunting, but it is mainly hip action. She is fun and you can tell the people with her are real people, not robots, doing each move perfectly and in exact synchronization. I also like that there are obvious different skill levels to follow. My only complaint is that she tends to stumble over the directions, so your first few times might be a little confusing."
4,Just right,"As other reviews have said, this isn't a true beginner's workout; it's not an instructional introduction to step. Since I used to do step when I was younger, I consider myself an advanced beginner or intermediate stepper, so this workout is perfect for me. The DVD that came with my step is a little too fast-paced for me at my current level, and I didn't care for the instructor either, so I'm glad I found this one. It's challenging and effective, but the choreography is simple, and the pace is fast enough to get my heart rate up but not so fast that I can't keep up.This is the first Kari Anderson DVD I've tried, but I'm sure it won't be the last. Her cueing isn't perfect, but with such straightforward moves, it's easy to follow what's going on. And her style is just right for me. She's not overly perky, but she doesn't pretend to be a drill sergeant, either. She's just very down-to-earth and normal. Kudos to her for putting together this fun and energizing workout."
2,A book that Teen shouldnt read!,"I am in 10th grader and I though that the Book wasnt very good,as our english class getting forced to read this, I though that the text shouldnt be read by a younger adult."
3,some good stuff here,"some cuts are good, some not so good, I wish I could have seen them back at the Balboa Rendezvous Ballroom before this all got started in the early 60's............"
5,Great 4 movie set,Highly recommend this 4 movie set to add to you collection. A good variety of movies in one DVD set.
4,Relax in Style,"Le Hammond Inferno have done it again. Some months ago I bought this compilation just for the attractive packaging and some promising names on the cover, but didn't really listen to it. Now that spring has finally come, the time is right for it, and it really exceeded my expectations. Combining japanese pop and euro-lounge-electronica this record could be considered specialist stuff or sophisticated background music, but it offers more than that. There really are some brilliant ideas in there, and one track (""Lotto"") has shot up to possibly becoming one of my all-time favourites - wow. Try ""Pool Position"", it will improve your summer. And don't forget to check out the Sushi 3003 and 4004 compilations..."
2,It did not work for me,This product did not work for me. I have tried many other products that also claim to be very efective for sexual moments but so far I have not found any good one yet.
1,Scary Stuff,"I took one of these and within one hour I was jittery beyond belief. Going by the label there were no indications that this product would cause such an effect. I can't function like this on a regular basis, I will attempt to return the rest of the bottle for a full refund to the Vitamin Shoppe where it was purchased. It sounded great from all the hype."
4,Wish he published the lyrics...,"Guy Forsyth has something to say and he says it well. I first heard him on my Ipod (Long Long Time was included). That was such a great song, I had to find out more about him. I hope he tours the midwest where I live.The only complaint I have is that some of his words are hard for me to make out. Some of the songs come through really well like 105 and Long Long Time and others like Mama's Favorite Son are still murky even after listening several times.Quite a difference from someone like 50 Cent where I'd rather not make out the words most of the time! Maybe Guy should consider rap or hip-hop to deliver his message."
5,"Great gel for fine, curly hair","My son inherited my curly hair and this gel works perfectly to smooth his curls and looks natural. Sometimes, I use it when his hair is dry for extra control. Never stiff or sticky and moisturizes his hair too."
3,"good, not great","I bought this product after my 9 month old son received (via the babysitters five year old daughter) a Very unfortunate haircut. I wanted something safe and gentle that would keep his hair pushed over to the side so his uneven bangs wouldn't be so obvious. This is certainly safe and gentle, but not so great at keeping his very long, very fine hair in place for very long. Probably works great for those babies without much hair, but he is not one of those babies and I often find myself reapplying two or three times a day."
5,Jayhawk!!!,"I believe this is the best account of the whole ground war that I have come across. The entire deployment was explained in a clear, unbiased, detailed view of the VII corps during Desert Shield/Storm. I have read ""Warriors rage"" and ""The road to Safwan"", both tell a part of the war from the ""Tanker"" point of view and are good books. Jayhawk, in my opinion, paints a much better picture and tells about the entire ground war and tells what orders were given to whom and how each unit complied. It was put out by the Department of the Army so there is a bit of ""Army language"" that would need to be researched if you are a civilian. I was impressed with how Stephen Alan Bourque told how the Iraqi army DID NOT just roll over and surrender (They DID fight), but were rolled over by a much smarter and superior army. This book has many pictures in each chapter and gives a bibliography after each chapter so it is pretty easy reading. GREAT BOOK! WORTH EVERY CENT!"
1,"Good story, badly read","The narrator's style and characterization are misplaced. It's as if an affable uncle is reading a story badly. Wrong choice, especially when there are such good Wodehouse interpreters out there (e.g., Jarvis, Mordern, Carmichael, etc). Wodehouse is, of course, wonderful, but choose another edition."
4,Comedy on the Golf Course,"I am not a golfer. The appeal of hitting a little white ball with a bent stick and then chasing after it eludes me.So why would I read a collection of golfing tales? The answer can be summed up in one word: Wodehouse. P.G. Wodehouse is, hands down, the funniest author I have ever read.This book contains ten golf-related short stories featuring a typical assortment of Wodehouse-style characters: likable, good-hearted, but often clueless and bumbling. As usual, love (or the hope of love) is the impetus of the plots and many misunderstandings and hilarious high jinks quickly ensue. Oh, if only real-life romance were this much fun!If you are a fan of screwball comedy or classic Brit-coms, you'll probably enjoy this book--even if you don't enjoy golf."
2,well written but not what I needed,"A well written book, but not what I was looking for. It did not help me in revitalizing my prayer life."
4,good stuff,"Bought this after hearing 'Big Boss Man' cut. Definitely not disappointing. Good tracks, some with just a touch more 'country' than I'd usually like, but all good listening. She can really lay down the blues, which is my preference."
3,Great camera while it lasted,"I was thrilled with the results of the camera, great panoramic pictures, great night shots, and everything one could ask for.However, one fine day, the camera just stopped working. The manufacturers looked at it and pointed out something about problems in power. I was expected to pay a lotfor repairs.BR>It was very disappointing."
4,book review,"very punctual delivery. but the mail fee is quite expensive!however, the book is clean.it's a good 1st time online purchase for me"
3,"Lots of pretty pictures, not much meat","""Timeframe"" excels in that it's packed with hundreds of photos, book covers, and other items of interest (including a picture of the Doctor Who pinball machine!). However, there's really nothing else new in the book, just the same old rehashing of info on the stories that even the casual Who fan should know."
3,"""ORQUESTA ARAGON?- CHA CHA CHA'S QUE HICIERON HISTORIA","I fully agree with this CD's assessment by ""a music fan"" in July of 1998. The group which recorded this CD is not the real Orquesta Aragon, even though it did a good job in interpreting some of this great cuban orchestra's mid to late 50's hits. For the sake of clarification and accuracy, Orfeon/Sony should have entitled this CD ""Remembering Orquesta Aragon"". In spite of that it is a good compilation, well played."
2,Obsolete Software,"I have used the French/Italian of this s/w originally designed for Win 3.1 going Win 95. As described it will work with later regimes.The main part of the program probably is bug free, but I did experience problems in the exercise part of the Italian version. There seems to be no support for this product and it is no longer being corredcted or developed so such problems will be unresolved.Given its date, it was at the beginning of such windows software and has stills rather than videos for the coversations. Also the teaching method also shows its age.Whether this is for you will depend upon how much you like the look feel of old software and its limitations. Could suit some people on a low budget not into the latest leading edge language learning technology and methodology. If cheap could be worth a look."
3,HARD TO READ,"THIS BOOK IS VERY HARD TO READ AS IT IS LOFTY AND WORDY.I'M AN ARTIST. I GO FOR SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD. THISBOOK TAKES WAY TO MUCH OF MY TIME TRYING TO READ IT. NOW THATBEING SAID, IT IS A GOOD, WELL WRITTEN BOOK GIVING GLORY TO FATHERGOD FOR ALL OUR TALENTS. I'M AFAID ONE OF THE TALENTS I'M LACKINGIS STAYING FOCUSED ON THIS READ.SORRY."
5,fantastic buy!,I love love LOVE these shoes! I couldn't believe I found these for $80! They usually retail for about $270. What a steal! They are fabulous. Heel is really high so not for ladies who have difficulty walking in high heels. I'll be wearing them to a wedding and can't wait to show them off! Great for a bride's wedding shoe as well.
5,We're Back A Dinosaur Story,An excellent movie for kids of ALL ages! I'm glad to finally find it on DVD.
4,Lovable dinos in N.Y.,"Steven Spielberg's 'We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story' is a story about a group of cute dinosaurs who is timetravelling to modern N.Y., where they befriend two kids, who falls in love with each other.The animation is old fashioned 90's standard, but the voices and the effects are great, and the 'Monsters Inc.' actual star John Goodman is very entertaining as Rex.This is something for the sci-fi and dino movies fans of all ages!"
2,scary for little kids,"I saw this movie in theatres when it came out; I was six years old at the time (1993). While I enjoyed it, the middle and ending scared me to death. It gave me nightmares and was scarier than the Neverending Story, which was also pretty frightening. I would recommend the first Land Before Time instead, since there are no children who turn into animals in that movie."
3,1st Universal animation in ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN! Finally!,"I guess most of you who have order this DVD like the movie, so I could forget about reviewing the story! The fact is, this is the 1st Universal animation presented in anamorphic widescreen! There is zero extra on this DVD, but I'm glad it finally released! Color is vibrant, and sound is in Dolby Digital 5.1,So, are they going to release the rest of their animation in DVD, like The American Tail and it sequel, and The Land Before Time? I wish ......."
4,good old time cartoon,I remember seeing this when I was little and loving it. When I was older I got to rewatch it and it was just as sweet. We're Back is as good as any Disney film!
3,"Less successful 1993 dinosaur film, but...","Lighthearted, easy-on-the-brain animated flick about dinosaurs coming ""back"" to visit NYC. Predictably (since this is animated stuff), they are friendly and an evil circus owner wants to exploit them. Kids fare should appeal to 2nd and 3rd graders, with fairly good animation and great voices. As for people older than nine, stick to Jurassic Park, a truly absorbing, much much more successful dinosaur film made the same year and directed by the producer of this one, Spielberg."
5,Funny and Great,Every child should own this movie.But i think this movie is for 7 and up yrs of age.A great classic.
5,Monkey Love/ Love those Monkeys!,"This is a wonderful little hard-backed book and just the right size for little hands. The pictures are so endearing and will enchant little ones as they ooh and ahhh over those little monkeys in their charming outfits and their demonstrations of affection in oh so many ways!I love the book, I love the Monkeys! Thanks Dee for such a treasure!edie brown"
3,Chip Off the Old Block,"Literally, boot tree arrived with a large chip missing off the top. Cost of shipping and handling is non-refundable. For complete satisfaction, buy your tree from a local vendor."
5,great,had to return for larger size..nows awaiting that order very easy to return a nd replace ..really i need more words................
4,good product,"I ordered for my combat boots. They were expensive however I ordered regular instead of wide and now my feet are paying for it. I ordered these to make them more comfortable, however they weren't wide enough so I had to modify them with some 100mph tape to make them do the job. That being said it's worth the money."
4,works fine,"Works as it is supposed to. I wish the boot tree was a little more expandable as some other shoe trees are, but it serves its purpose"
5,Pure Genius,"""Think Drink"" was a song Vince wrote for the International Coffee Group, and was played extensively on new York City radio stations like WABC. It is interesting to note that the radio personalities were allowed to adlib much the music's one minute voice overs. It got quite interesting with such cut ups as Dan Ingram and Ron Lundy.This is a great collection with numerous ""one shot"" tunes you will get nowhere else. ""Newport Theme"" is typical Guaraldi ""bossa nova"" tempo with great melody. Of course with the success, short lived as it was, of the liturgical setting Grace Cathedral disc, we have the ""Theme to Grace"" melody, which sadly was not probbaly the best tidbit from the Grace Cathedral effort. Vince lived too short a creative life. I am glad this was re-issued."
4,Great resource to learn,"This is a great book for learning 12 leads, although I think it is necessary to have some previous experience with EKGs. This book is not a quick overview, it will take some time to go through each chapter, interpret each EKG and read the explanation to really understand. It has some great tips on how to look at 12 leads and each 12 lead is followed by explanations, although some of the explanations come before the EKG which can be a spoiler. Personally, I wish there were more practice 12 leads not just sorted by category as in the book (each chapter has EKGs about that chapter, ie QRS chapter emphasizes QRS variations and abnormalities). There is also an advanced level of interpretation available for each EKG provided. One last thing, the book does not read like a normal book but rather is read like a calendar which can be awkward at times. Overall a great learning resource if you have the time to go from beginning to end."
5,recommend this book,very good explanation of normal waveforms and the rationale behind abnormal waveforms. Like the format of more basic information presented separately from more complex information that may be reviewed concurrently or after learning the basics first.
2,Helpful,This book provided good diagrams that have singlehandedly trained me in the interpertation of ECGs.
5,Excellent Learning Aid!!!!,"This book was excellent. Comprehensive text, very readable, great graphics, hundreds of full sized ecgs in color. Three levels of mastery helped to simplify the process of learning to interpret ecgs. Recommend this book highly!!!!!"
4,"Chords is all you'll learn, but for that it gets the job done.","As a Beginner, I was fairly satisfied with this DVD. The presenter spoke at a slow enough pace for anyone to look down at their hands before playing, with enough time to check back at the screen again and play along with him.Chords and nothing but Chords---Major / Minor. This DVD is perfect for touching the surface of accompanying guitar.In the end though, for the price, there could have been much more...but don't get me wrong, it's quality learning."
2,Not That Great....,"I know that this CD has almost every hit that Ritchie ever recorded, but I do not favor the track La Bamba on this cd over the mono version of La Bamba. I have 13 Ritchie Valens cds, and this is definitely not the best one. I would say go to 101cd.com and search Richie Valens (no T) and purchase the Greatest Hits CD, which is the best compilation!"
1,"Great book if your into kidnapping, torture, rape","I personally love BDSM with an edge and enjoy the books by Joey Hill which are very well written and romantic. This is crap. Girl is kidnapped not by a romantic love interest but by a guy who starves her, beats and degrades her until she will do anything to improve her condition. He eventually 'takes' her. After training she is sold to an older guy and then both he, his guests and the hired help as well as his son. He likes to take her after his son has had her.Son falls in love with her an in the last 3 pages of this book frees her from a sex show being broadcast on the internet where the guy who owns her sells it off to make money from the show. He sold his other slaves off to other owners to do more internet sex shows. Lovely.The son marries her (very believeable) and they live happily ever after.Not romantic, not sexy and IMO a lousy HEA."
5,Exactly what I wanted,I bought the Fred Headlamp and am very happy with it. The product was well described and there weren't any surprises. The shipping was quick and hassle free.
3,"Not worth it - It's a ""Liquid Sounds"" again.","I love Paul Smith and Andre Previn. However, this Paul Smith is really a remake of his great Liquid Sounds album. He did add some instruments to it, but its not worth the extra money for the Japanese re-mastering. Both my wife and I (she a pro jazz pianist) consider this album more of a background easy-listening type, rather then a 'grab and hold your attention' normal Paul Smith."
2,Useless if you want to cook something quickly,"I used it for a couple of days. The price is reasonable and delivery was satisfactory. However, the burner stopped heating your food automatically after just 4-5 mins' heating, then it heated up again after 3-5 mins' silence. I couldn't use this burner (even you choose the 1000 Watt burner) to cook my noodle soup in a normal way. So if you want to cook something quickly without any break in between, don't buy this stuff."
3,Straw broke first month of use,"I really liked this cup, and bought it based on the reviews. It kept her milk cold, and did not leak. However, my daughter came home from school less than a month after purchase, and the straw was torn. I always noticed that it was a bit too long to easily shut the top, and in her attempt to close the lid, it snapped the top of the straw off. I am hoping that it was just defective to begin with, as this didn't seem to be a problem in other reviews. I returned it to Amazon, and will be trying again with the same kind, since it is still so highly reviewed. Hoping for better luck the second time around."
2,"Not leak proof, not kid (or mom) proof","I love the look of these bottles, the fact that they keep liquids cold (to some degree; I live in the desert), that they aren't plastic, and that they have a straw. That's all I can recommend.We've cracked and broken the plastic lid simply by dropping it on the tiled kitchen floor. Replacement straws are available from Thermos, but not lids.The bottles do leak -- especially if they're bounced around a jogging stroller...and beware the projectile spouting if you flip open the top on an airplane or after driving up a mountain! If you leave the bottle in the sun too long, and flip the top you'll get ""peed"" on too...However, because of the straw and the stainless steel, I'll keep buying them. Wish our Siggs came with a straw option..."
1,don't buy this cup,"(I don't usually take the time to review items--but I thought it was worth the warning on this one)I had high hopes for this cup. And it let me down in a number of ways.Although it does suggest handwashing, it is described as dishwasher safe.After a few washes, the bottom cover fell off, exposing the glue underneath, and would never stick back onto the cup.Also, the rubber portion of the straw separated from the base of the cup--total choking hazard.It was expensive, and I am extremely annoyed. (grateful that my daughter did not swallow the broken straw--but extremely annoyed)"
1,NOT leak proof!,I bought these for my 18 month old daughter so we could have cold milk for her on our upcoming trip. I was so excited. The first time we used them they LEAKED all over the diaper bag. These leak all the time whether or not they are open or closed. I am really disappointed.
1,Horrible customer service,"The item photographed is not what was sent. A refund was given, but much time and energy was wasted and never heard from the actual seller. Refunded amount only after contacting Amazon and filing a claim. Would not recommend!"
5,perfect alternative to plastic straw cups,"As a person concerned about using plastics (pthalates(sp?), BPA, etc), this is a great alternative for a kids straw cup! My daughter loves the fact that it is PINK and has a button to pop up the straw, and I love the fact that the bottle is leak proof. Another benefit is that cold beverages stay cold way longer than with a plastic cup. Good product Thermos!"
3,brief encounter,"the encounter with Miss Ross apparently in her house and with her family, half way through the short book was illuminating - one wonders - was it a dream, did it really happen, was it true? These were my questions"
1,Horrible,"""To Meet A Star"" is perhaps the dumbest collection of words I have ever read. Ms. Nelson should be ashamed of herself. This is the work of a 10 year old child. There is no narrative, no line through, absolutely no cohesive point of view. One can only assume Ms. Nelson has some sort of mental limitations. This book is an insult to Diana Ross, to Christians, and to anyone who can read the printed word."
2,What the books says about the book,"I had trouble writing a review of this book - every time I tried, what I wrote felt too harshly critical. So I thought I'd let the book review itself by asking the oracle what it thought of this book.The result of the cast was Hexagram 60 - Limitation, with lines 2 and 6 moving. Line 2 moving says ""Not going out of the gate of the courtyard. Misfortune."" Line 6 moving says ""Bitter limitation. Perseverance brings misfortune. Regrets vanish."" So there you have it, my review, as given to me by the book itself."
3,Respectable but not groundbreaking.,Faithful to the readability of Baynes but also acknowledges recent scholarship. Does not provide calligraphy of chinese characters and does not provide much in the way of folk history of hexagrams. I have great nostalgia for Baynes but really appreciate the insights in Alfred Huang's translation (despite his audacious claim of completeness in his subtitle.) This translation falls somewhere in the middle.
5,WOW! WOW! WOW! HOT AND SIZZLING!,"For the love of God, I'm not into this kind of stuff but all I can say is HOT HOT HOT HOT and HOT and I couldn't put it down! I was thinking, 'Man, I wish I was Genevieve.' I guess that is the point of a book, to go into their world. Naughty, naughty, naughty...lol! But I loved the ending."
1,amazed that anyone likes this book,"I generally like Black Lace books, but this made me shake with rage. How could an otherwise intelligent woman agree to act as a prostitute, which is effectively what the female lead of this book does. Selling oneself for a business deal is the same as standing on a street corner. This woman obviously had no sense of self-worth or self respect and that I found sad. Was there no other way the ""hero"" of the story could get to know the ""heroine"" that to propose such a tawdy deal. I am truly, truly amazed that anyone liked this book."
1,cheap price and quality,I'm 150lbs and the board could barely hold my weight. It is very light and the material is low quality.
5,very good,"This was one of the first spiritually inclined books i've ever read and was rather hard to get my head around some of the information. Along with the big words :), however i stuck with it and this book really has helped me loads and its one of those books which i keep going back to and reading again."
4,Bliss spiff upper lip,"Shipped very quickly! Slow results, but worth it. Lasts a long time. Just make sure that while you use this product, you are also applying sunscreen to your face (at least SPF 50) every couple of hours if you're going to be going outside. Any sun exposure may increase the darkness."
3,"Not a bad guide, but lacking in content","I found this book well-written and posessing good overall appearance, but lacking in useful content. Over 1/3 of the first part, which introduces the craft and weapons, is mostly the same information that can be found in the user's guide or on the freespace web site. Although the mission descriptions are good, they are not detailed enough to really present new, winning strategies. There were no references to awarded medals, and how to earn them all, and I noticed that at least several ""hidden"" objectives in some missions were not mentioned. 90% of the strategy and mission content was information I already knew from playing the game for about 20 hours. Overall, though not a bad book, I would not hold very high hopes for learning alot more about the strategies."
5,Nice!!,"Ignore the couple of naysayers here. Especially the one who carps about Dame Kiri's ""pronounciation"". Yes, in complaining about her diction he misspells ""pronunciation"" not once, but twice.Anyway, this is a lovely CD. I don't know much about Maori songs, but I know a thing or two about beautiful singing, and that is available in abundance here.Some of what Dame Kiri does here is so subtle that the beauty of it slips by almost unnoticed.Quite nice."
5,Completely addictive...be careful!,"I only just ordered this CD a few days ago, but have been listening to it in it's entirety on Rhapsody for a few weeks now. I've reached the point where I must hear it on an almost daily basis. I've been a fan of Kiri's from a distance for some time, now, owning only two of her previous CDs. This one, however, knocked me off my feet. The emotion and feeling of the songs, and Kiri's interpretation of them, is unbelieveable. I'm hooked."
2,"Nice Kiri, but NOT the best of Maori music","For those who love Kiri Te Kanawa's singing, this is a major change of pace. She goes back to her Maori heritage and sings along with loud musical accompanyment. At least for my ear it is loud music -- in my opinion Maori music should be without any accompanyment, or at a low level. The true Maori voices are such a joy when they are singing unaccompanied. This CD was accompanied by The Abbey Road Ensemble -- nice for rock musicians, but not what I am looking for.The song selection is fairly good, although I was disappointed that some of my favorate pieces were not provided -- but what can you do on a single disk.A real plus for this CD was the provision good booklet notes on the various compositions."
3,"Should be marked ""For Entertainment Value Only""","I had high hopes for this but have been a bit disappointed due to it's accuracy and inability to keep contact with the outdoor sensor. I have it near my house thermostat and it's 2 degrees different at all times. I emailed their customer support and they told me that it's within their guidelines of +/- 3 degrees accuracy. Well, I could have saved a lot of money and bought something with the same accuracy.Also, randomly, it will lose it's connection with the outdoor sensor and you have to bring in the sensor and remove/insert batteries in a certain order in order for the link to work again.The laughable thing is that it has a smiley face or a frown face based on temp/humidity and it's not adjustable. So while I have great conditions in my house, it's never shown a smiley face as long as I have owned it...I guess it's telling me it doesn't like the conditions instead of telling me if I will or not."
4,No Problems so far..,"This weather station has worked out great for me.The only thing I have experienced is that the outdoor sensor sometimes quits sending the signal. My guess is that it goes into a tizzy when the humidity outside is too high (+80%?), which if true, in my opinion would be a defect.Battery life of the outdoor sensor's batteries is awesome but not so for the base station, needs to be replaced more often(~3-4 months)."
1,Non-working La Crosse Tech WS-9032U Wireless Weather Station,"We owned a lesser priced LaCrosse wireless weather station that worksperfectly and we love. Deciding to upgrade we ordered the above listed model. It worked well for a couple of days and then the outside temp.no longer registered.We have tried in every way to get it working again with no luck. changing batteries, the location of the outside sensor, inside location, reviewing and going over the manual step by step and still no success. Not happy with this product. If anyone has had similar problems and figured it out please advise."
1,La Crosse Technology WS 9032U Wireless Weather Station,I agree with many of the other reviews. I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone. Have had it just over a year and in that time it was sent back to the factory to fix. Don't believe they did anything because within a short time it still didn't work. Doesn't read outside temp/humidity... just quits. Same thing has happened to the inside temp/humidity. Calls and e-mail to LaCrosse goes unanswered. All I wanted is a reading for inside & outside temp/humidity and all I've gotten is hassle. They even told me to get batteries with a 2013 date on them now in less than 5 months it has failed again. What a piece of junk.
2,"Too long, Too expensive","They don't sell this 4 pack in Borders. And when I was at Borders to check for a pre-order, they sold this in 4 separate DVDs for 20 dollars each. Why spend 80 dollars for this movie? And it's 8 hours long. That is a day's worth of watching this miniseries. Bad movie!"
4,Some Good Songs On This Album,"For the past year I've been going back into the 'history of surf music' from the early 60's, to check out what other surf bands that were happening that I missed as a kid or didn't know about at the time. The band, 'The Lively Ones' definately had some good tunes. Out of all the repackaged-collection albums of 'The Lively Ones', I think this particular one is really good. Check-out the samples on Amazon.Com and see for yourself."
3,"Very nice drawings, but a little violent for young kids","If you have young kids, I would not recommend this movie.Otherwise, it is another approach to the wise men story, that might lead to read the Bible with your kids. Which is a good thing then!"
1,Very Dark,"This movie is very dark. Please note that it is ""not rated."" It is NOT even close to a ""G"" movie, and it is closer to a ""PG13"" with all of the dark magic and imagery. It has nothing to do with the true story of the Wise Men."
3,Disappointed,I had hoped for a better story but this fel short of the reviews I had read. I was pleased with the service but disappointed in the product.
2,Cute but not durable,"This costume looked cute but did not last long and was not especially durable. The glasses broke after the first week of use. The doctor coat is not very exciting because its white with a pocket on the side, but that is what a dr. coat usually looks like. The headpiece also ripped soon after its use. If it was better made, maybe the kids would have had more fun with it."
2,You Get What You Pay For,The price said it all. It worked well for a while then the power supply went bad. A few weeks later the screen would black out intermittently. This is not the sort of thing you want happening to you when you have a term paper dead line.
1,Cheap Company,"Owed me hundred dollar rebate and refuse to pay.First month after I submitted the receipt, I called them. Then the customer service asked me to wait for 3 month for processing. 3 months later, when I called, nobody answer the phone anymore. As I kept calling for another month, I finally caught one guy who told me that they did not recieve anything from me. I guessed they said same story to others."
3,"Not bad, but not the most useful.","When our church added a new front sign on which to list church events and/or quaint sayings, I purchased a couple of books with such sayings. 701 Sentence Sermons was one of the books I purchased. The sentence sermons are fine as far as content goes, but they are just a little too long for us. So, if you have limited space on your sign, or a limited number of letters to use, this may not be the book for you. Our church has found the book ""Forbidden Fruit Creates Many Jams"" to be a much more useful book. Even still, 701 Sentence Sermons does offer a nice collection."
4,A true complete collection,"The Complete Collection is a digipak set of the same 6 discs from the individual volumes. It was released in late 2004 for a limited run, just for the holiday seasons. The product image above is actually an outer shell package that houses both the digipak and a collector's pendent/key ring, which is visible in the center of the package."
3,OK,The best part of the anime are the character dimensions. Kazuma and Ryoho do more than just chase each other throughout the series and calling the other inept for their ideals. They see what it's like to be in the place of the other person with many surprises along the way.The peeves I had with this series were 1) the ending (but I won't tell you what happens) and 2) the repetitive nature of anime heroines tripping all over themselves when they're running to the their main squeeze and thereby being caught into an accidental hug.I will thus rate the following (1-10; 10 being the highest) based on quality or amount:Action: 10Romance: 3Soundtrack: 6Dubbing: 5Characters: 9Story: 8Violence: 6This anime is best for those ages 13 and up
2,Didn't get want I ordered,"I bought what was supposedly a 6 disc set, I ended up receiving only a 3 disc set. Bummer man!"
3,Average at best,"When adult swim put this on for a while. I was kind of curious I just decided ""what the heck I'll give it a shot."" My impressions? Well, it neither good or bad, it's just average. While it does have a story line that might or might not keep you interested (depending on what episode you're on), most of the ""action"" is sometimes way too repetitive, that it becomes rather boring after a while; and because of this, I just completely lost interest in by the 12th episode. It didn't really make a difference to me whether Kazuma or Ryuhou won...I was just like is that pretty much it? While there were a few moments of unexpected (and welcomed) surprises, the show pretty much never really took off. I can't complain about the animation, as it wasn't too bad, neither were the voice actors, they did an ok job, the music was ok, but still it wasn't good enough. 3 stars."
3,AMAZING untill the end...,"Starts out great a compelling plot, good characters, pretty good voice acting and great art style for how old it is but the last 4 or 5 episodes just killed it for me it totally went away from what the show was and made an ugly environment and uninteresting bad guy who is also very ugly in one of his forms and could have gone so many different directions and made the ending lame and annoying!"
4,Important:,"This anime is amazing and beautifully written as long as you never, ever watch the last episode. Not even that, just don't watch the last five minutes of the last episode. It is a giant middle finger to the entire series. It is wonderful, funny, dramatic, and entrancing. Up to the last episode. Then it's ruined."
3,The contents are exciting but...,"I would recommend this anime for any action anime fans. Totally, it has a lot of fightings and battlings in this anime. Generally, it is very exciting and draw my curiosity to the finale. As I refuse to expose the details, I can say I was excited while watching it. However, the finale might be a little disappointing, not about the result. It is about how it wraps up the stuff"
5,History at its best,"After every page in this book I wanted more. The book is well written and makes significant connections that make sense of history. The significance of Stonehenge and the explanation of the megalithic yard are totally believable and helpful in understanding how complex structures that predate writing can come into existence.This book left me with so many questions unanswered, in such a positive way, that I went on the trail of additional books to help me dig deeper into current studies and understanding of history.When you read it - I'll assume that you will enjoy it - then read ""Rosslyn"" and see where it takes you!"
2,White Supremacy?,"I have generally enjoyed Robert Lomas books. I have to admit this has to be the boldest attempt an author to paint ancient Egyptian white. This book reminds me of the turn of the centuary archeologist who would say ""nothing originated out of Africa, it must have been the Greeks who gave them their knowledge"". But even worst the Druids giving someone knowledge to build civilization? To even suggest that anything British or European are the twelve tribes of Israel are the founders of ancient civilization is a cruel, insensitive joke.I give it an extra star for it being a good read."
4,A challenging and good read.,"I thought this was a little repetitive, but that is the style used by the authors to get their point across. This is well worth the read if you are willing to analyze the data presented objectively first, then make up your mind later.I personally thought the facts of the argument were well presented and didn't have an issue with any of the references to Biblical information that other reviewers mentioned. I say judge for yourself!Overall a good read.Rev. Stephan Bradley[...]"
4,Prehistory Reexamined,"The authors have presented a beguiling collection of research and ideas about the prehistory of the British Isles, Megalithic culture and connections with the Freemasons and early Judaism through the legends of Enoch. The story centers around the astronomy inherent in the Megalithic sites of Ireland, Scotland and England. The authors write in a comfortable style of enthusiastic camaraderie. Have they overreached the possible? The mysteries abound. I read it once then turned around and read it again. I loved it."
5,Fascinating Search!,"Whether you agree about the reality of two comet impact occurrences on earth (the most recent 3120 BC)as the authors conclude, should not detract from a thoroughly absorbing account of the building of ancient henges in different parts of the world. Find out about the real meaning of the Book of Enoch and Enoch's strange lessons from Uriel! The stone henges, it turns out, can tell the time very accurately, whether using a solar mark or light given off by Venus every eight years. You can go to Ireland and see for yourself, which makes it all the more convincing. But as with other books of this type you cannot take it all in in the first read, it's quite dense."
3,A spotty read,"This is my first book by these two authors. I found the first 1/4th of the book incredibly interesting to the point I couldn't put it down. However, at times, the book becomes far to drudged down into over explaining things. I would find some chapters held my attention others didn't. I would still recommend the book, because the more interesting stuff was extremely interesting, especially their take on the meanings of the Book of Enoch and Enoch's interaction with the Archangel Uriel and the origins of Freemasonry. As far as their take on an intelligent lost knowledge of a civilization lost in antiquity, I found Graham Hancock's books did a far better job, especially Fingerprints of the Gods."
3,Many Flaws but Very Interesting,"Although reviewer dave_42 brings up various good points, this book still has some interesting info, I would absolutely not give it to a newbie Christian or even a solid one, but only to an advanced one, otherwise you may end up leading the reader to a bad path. It's good for late night reading when you can't fall asleep."
1,Misrepresents the Biblical Account!,"In the book description I read: ""In the Bible, Uriel was an angel who taught [Enoch], Noah's grandfather, the movements of the sun, moon and stars.""This is untrue. The Bible says nothing of the sort! He may, however, be referring to the uncanonized Book of Enoch. Nevertheless, his scholarship, or whatever we might call it, seems up front irresponsibly shoddy."
1,Plagiarism,Knight and Lomas have lifted the idea of a comet hitting the Earth and causing a great flood straight out of Ignatius Donnelly's Ragnarok : the Age of Fire and Gravel. How dishonest of these authors. They don't even mention Donnelly's work in their index or bibliography. That alone should call into question everything they claim to be scientific.A flood of nonsense. You are better off reading Stephen Jay Gould.
1,uriel's toilet,"This is the biggest load of non-poetic drivel ever given credence to in text. (...)No backup whatsoever, and lets face it from these authors, do we really expect anything other than a glorification for freemasonry, their shadowy world of conspiracy and secrets, along with other nonsense. (...)"
4,Thor Heyerdahl has an heir?,"...Thor Heyerdahl who once argued for a different viewpoint of history from that which is commonly accepted now has an heir. The party line of everything originating in the mid east is patently false as an incredibly ""advanced"" science pre-dated Sumer and Egypt. And it was based in Ireland, Scotland, England (and in my own opinion, Spain and North Africa)Uriel's Machine and their extensive coverage of the Book of Enoch show that advanced knowledge started in the west. Overall, a great fast paced and thought provoking work."
3,I'm still not sure!,"I read this book a few weeks ago, and I'm still not sure what I thought about it! It was a very well written story, and it definatly kept me on the edge of my seat, but it also left me feeling very uncomfortable at the end. The more I read, the more I found that Erik was not a very likeable male character, and I couldn't quite understand why Meredith was stopping her life for him. This is the first book of Lynn Erickson's that I've read, and I'm not really sure if I want to read another!"
3,Wonderful dance music .,"Each song has good rhythm,good for dancing. For marathon dancing. The title of each song is numbered but it goes on continously.If you know spanish then you can follow which song is being sang.One cannot skip and chose the individual song.Hit pause when you need to rest while dancing to the music.It's a test of endurance.Good luck!"
2,Sorry to say.....,".... I just didn't like this one. I am an upper intermediate to advanced home exerciser, and I tried the step portion several times, but just couldn't get into it. I got bored and thought that Kari, although very fluid, was just not my kind of instructor. To me, she just seemed a bit TOO professional - I want to have fun in a cardio workout, and this was just bland for me. I gave it two stars just for the fact that it has cardio benefits, but for me it just wasn't much fun. I would rather workout to Michelle Dozios or Keli Roberts - they both pack ultra intense moves that are fun and motivating. This one just wasn't worth the time."
1,hated this whole DVD,"I literally popped it in the day I received it and was really disappointed. The moves are very dancy and are hard to keep up with. I tried this one several times, but I just hate it! I'm always skeptical when I buy Dvds by trainers that I've never had before, but since she seemed to have so many I figured a lot of people liked her so might as well try. WRONG!!! This now sits in the dark corner at the back of my t.v. cabinet with all the other rejects!"
2,a bit onesided for my taste,"Though the book was bulky, the style was for m a bit dry as well, the real prblem I had with it was that I nearly only saw stories of non-orthodox converts. I would not recommend it as an intro to love judaism....."
3,"A little dry, almost academic...","I was expecting to love this book, since I usually enjoy reading peoples' stories of discovering Judaism. Unfortunately, I found the writing a bit dry and the stories soon unengaging. Somewhere after about half, I gave up--something I rarely do."
4,"Not to be confused with Thomas Dorsey, Gospel songwriter","This is NOT the composer of the gospel song, ""Precious Lord, Take My Hand"". This is big-band jazz, and it's wonderful! It was the ""pop"" music 60-80 years ago, so it does become a bit repetitive and gives an idea of being commercial (that's because it was). But it's a great listen for jazz lovers.And thanks for the corrected song list."
1,BAD MIXING!!!,"I can't explain it any easier than... When your head is stopped up and your ears are muffled, that's what this cd sounds like! There are two versions of ooh pah poo doo on the album, the first sounds like a needle drop in the first few seconds and the second is just plain BAD! Too bad since DEL FI is usually good with their other oldie collections!"
1,Is this plajarism?,"Looking at this book, I was immediately struck that portions of it appeared to me to be almost a direct copy of a 1956 book by Cornell Professor Dennis G. Shepherd called Principles of Turbomachinery. Many of the pictures are IDENTICAL, and even some tables appear to have been lifted directly out of Professor Shepherd's book. What's up with that?"
4,turbomachinery,"there are very few books, written on this topic ,this book provides us useful knowledge of turbomachinery.I have just scan this book , but it seem to have good stuff."
1,The legend has sold out.,"The Cuttin Horse black is an embarassment for the great name of S&W. The cheapest metal blade painted black. Hey,China can manufacture anything you want - so why not attach your name to a quality product? This knife is not worth 2 dollars, much less the 9 to 15 dollar price range they soak you for. I'll never buy anything S&W again. Masterblaster."
4,Great lyrics,"Listen to the words in Loretta's music. There's an exuberance and straightforwardness that's missing in today's slick, overly-produced country songs. Just listen to the lyrics of ""Happy Birthday."" No one can break up better than Loretta--with humor and panache.""Well I know where you're going and who's gonna meet you thereI know how late you'll be comin' home but guess who doesn't careTonight I'll step out tooand since I won't be hereHappy Birthday, Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!My best wishes may be early but I'm not sticking aroundTo bake a cake for your birthday while you're out runnin'aroundShe can help you celebrateMay she bring you lots of cheerHappy Birthday, Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year.Now I've made my mind upPlayed seconds long enoughYou think I don't mean itSo you're gonna call my bluffBut I'll be busy packingWhile you're holding her nearHappy birthday, merry Christmas, and happy New Year..."""
1,Bad,"If you like nasal-nosed hillbillies singing about cheatin' and drinkin', this is for you. If you're ready for something other than these goofy novelties, go elsewhere."
3,Dostoyevski is better,"Read the book. It's much better. In the movie, the story is spoiled a bit.The movie itself is ok, with one main problem: The main character Raj is a bit strange and I didn't feel any sympathy for him. There are much much better and also better looking indian actors. This problem spoils the movie as a whole.Sakina is beautiful, so worth watching because of her :)Songs are ok, but other bollywood movies have much better songs.Since this is one of the few bollywood blurays so far, I don't recommend not buying it, but don't expect much."
1,Probably spent a good amount on the visuals but not enough on the plot,"The visuals (art, lighting, effects etc) were stunning - but that's it. I couldn't even make it halfway. The story was sooo weird. I've seen many Bollywood films (not more than your average Indian but certainly more than your average American) and I can honestly say this is one of the worst stories/plots ever - I don't even remember what was going on.. I just remember telling myself, ""hold on..give it another 10 minutes."" After 40-45 minutes I pulled the DVD out and cursed at myself for wasting that much time. Again, just want to say the visuals were great (the only reason I added one star)... I really wish the story would have been better."
3,Good adaptation,"This is a creative and welcome departure from most Bollywood films, but nothing really special or moving about these performances."
3,Not what I expected.,"This films description gave the impression that there would be scenes of northern India. The film is very dark, centered on a bridge in the middle of a very fake looking town. The music is enjoyable but the story is rather sordid. The Bollywood rendition of Pride and Prejudice was so wonderful I guess I expected similar adaptation. Not a family film."
1,Dark.,"This movie was dark and depressing without a cohesive story-line. Who was this story about? The prostitute? The musician? The girl on the bridge? I still have no idea who the main character was supposed to be, but I also don't really care, because all the characters were unlikeable. There were too many points of view going on throughout the movie. I watch Bollywood films because of the colors and vibrancy, this film had none of that. I found the characters annoying and I couldn't wait for this movie to end! I had a difficult time watching this movie."
2,Blu-ray pic quality is ok but very bad audio quality,The picture quality as expected from blu-ray is not upto mark. The sound quality is very poor. May be the sound recordist has not set the equiliser correctly.Sandeep
5,Beautiful and Engrossing,"I'm a big fan of Sanjay Leela Bansali and when I had heard mixed reviews about this movie, I thought I might not like it. Boy was I wrong. This movie may not be fast paced like Dhoom 2, but it's beautiful and captures your heart from the first frame. Ranbir and Rani are amazing and I loved the scenery. Don't listen to the bad reviews...watch this movie and then judge it."
2,Over-produced Bollywood,"This movie was well produced and has a beautiful, semi-fantastical setting (almost more like a village in France than India). The acting and cinematography were both very interesting, with some beautiful shots. However, it lacked the light-hearted comedy and story that attracts independent American viewers. My wife and I love seeing Indian movies about the conflicts between traditional Indian society and modernity. In these movies, the family is both part of the plot and oftentimes comic relief. However, I didn't laugh once during this film. It's a serious love story, but mixed with the dancing and fairy tale setting, it's hard to take seriously.A related problem is that this movie simply had too much singing and dancing. I know Bollywood movies tend to have a lot of singing and dancing, but at times this movie seemed to have more music video scenes than plot. I ended up fast-forwarding these sequences."
3,Superjazz,"It was of course killin. However, it seemed like another ""Superjazz"" record from the 80's to me. I only say that because I love Kenny's playing. I feel like it lacked a genuine vibe. A once or twice listen for me."
4,tanked and over the top,"high octane, never lets up, sax almost flies out of his hands. in the tradition of joe henderson and john coltrane, but more. maybe he believes his alto is a tenor, or sometimes a trumpet. and very hip, a sound that resonates for young audiences.it's not about anything I say about this cd, what it is is the copy i own is a replacement copy and, like my first copy, this one gets a lot of play.highly recommended.kenny garrett alto and soprano saxophonesvernell brown pianocharnett moffett basschris dave drums"
5,"Jesus, God how amazing","If you dug Songbook, you'll dig this. If you're a ""Simply Said"" kind-of-guy, I doubt this one is for you. This date is swinging hard without the mellow undertones and sappy New Agey feel of some other work. It is simply awesome - it sounds like a live date if that helps you visualize. You can hear throwbacks to 85' KG (almost just recognizing where he's been but nothing more than a nod to that past) in this but it is a *totally* fresh, new sound.A definite winner..."
5,"SHE IS A SNEAKY, KNIVING BI@#H","First off I hate Carolyn Joseph! I peeped her long time ago in the book. Something told me she was just too good to be true. Something had to be up with her. And her son was just as bad. I really felt for Bryan Terry when he had to tell his son to pack his things , because she said she couldnt do this step parent thing after he was trying to be a daddy to her son. I WANTED TO FIGHT HER!(LMAO) Even though Bryan deserved what he got in the end. I did adore him. Overall the story was excellent. Talk around town is there will be an edited version.Much shorter and less raw. I dont think I'm going to enjoy that as much.I'm glad I was able to get my limited edition copy and I even got it autographed by the author himself( he is fione yall!!) EXCITNG READ GO GET IT YALL, RACHEL BABY"
5,BABY YALL AINT READY!!!!!!!! (LMAO),"Bryan Terry is off the chain! I was laughin so hard at this man.Well actually it was the author. You really do think you know these characters.How many situations is he going to end up in, DAMN! WHY DO THESE FEMALES CLING TO HIM SO? For what, he doesn't have anything but DRAMA.By the time i wa mid-way thru this book , i understood, that is all i can say. Bryan Terry really was full of charm , sooo charismatic, very warm , genuine and sincere to those he let inside.Who would want to be without that is how i felt.Not to mebtion the man did not take any prisoners in the bed room. I would have done some of that stuff he had them doing(smh)the man was good child(wink)but he never saw it comin(sad)... Hilariously funny!, witty!, down to earth heartbreakingly real!! That is what it is. You might think you know, BABY YALL AINT READY(LMAO) You tell it like it t-i is Kerry E.Wagner.You got my vote"
5,You can not deny this one,"This book was on point. It takes you through the best and the worst in relationships. There is nothing better than reading something truthful about relationships, and being able to relate to the characters themselves. This book makes you realize that there is more to a relationship than bright skies and smooth sailing! Picture yourself going through the trials and tribulations of a trying relationship, pleasing your mate and his/her family, building your own foundation while trying to establish yourself. Then feeling like your partner is ready to give up on you and you are ready to give up on your partner, but you can't let go and all of a sudden...... Just be sure to read this book!!!"
5,FAST PACED!!!!!!!,"THIS IS MY OVERVIEW OF THIS STORY. INITIALLY IT MAY BE OFFENSIVE BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE. THOUGH THE AUTHOR SETS YOU UP VERY NICELY. GIVING YOU A PLAY BY PLAY BEFORE THE GAME ACTUALLY STARTS. ONCE YOU ARE IN THE GAME , EVERYTHNG MANIFEST ITSELF JUST AS HE PREDICTS. STILL LEAVING US UNABLE TO BRACE OURSELVES AND BECOME PREPARED FOR THE EVENTS THAT ARE TO ENSUE. INCREDIBLY PUT TOGETHER. NO STONE IS LEFT UNTURNED IN THIS NOVEL. EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TOP RELATE. FROM POLITICALLY CORRECT , PIMP TO POLITICIAN. THERE IS SOMETHING IN HERE FOR ALL. 34 UN WINDING CHAPTERS AS MY WIFE CALLED IT. NOT ONE SLOW, VERY FAST PACED , YOU WONT BE ABLE TO NOT FINISH READING. AND MY WIFE IS THE CONSUMATE CHRISTIAN! SHE FOUND HER WAY TO THE END OF THIS STORY. AFTER INITIALLY THINKING THE BOOK WAS GARBAGE...NOW IF THAT AINT ATESTIMONY TO THE BRILLIANCE AND GENIUS OF HOW THIS STORY WAS PUT TOGETHER. I DONT KNOW WHAT ISAS THEY SAID BRAVO MR. WAGNER! BRAVO! FROM THE DEACON"
1,He did that...,"I am upset that I wasted my money on this book. It was not very well written at all, and the story line does not flow. It jumps from one subject to another quite frequently, with no ties to bind them together. The grammar is hideous. I would like to know who edited this book, and have them fired immediately. My suggestion-do not waste your time on this rag."
5,GROWING PAINS,"*****WELL!!!THIS BOOK WILL MOST CERTAINLY OPEN YOU UP TO A LOT OF STREET KNOWLEDGE AND ALSO THE GROWING PAINS OF A BOY TRYING SO VERY HARD TO TRANSITION TO A MAN WHILE MAKING A LOT OF WRONG CHOICES THAT WILL RENDER TO BE VERY COSTLY EVEN DEADLY IN THE END. VERY DESCRIPTIVE TO THE POINT THAT YOU ARE THERE IN THE MOMENT OF EACH SCENE. THE AUTHOR HAS THE ABILITY TO OFFER THE PERFECT SET UP THAT LEAD YOU RIGHT INTO HIS MEANING...PERFECT DIALOGUE WITH A GENUINE DEGREE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL NOT LEAVE YOU DISAPPOINTED, YOU WILL LITERALLY LAUGH OUT LOUD!! SUPERB..JUICY...EVEN DIRTY ""MOST OF THE TIME""..LOL CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL*****"
5,Damn Baby!!!- You Did That,"All I can say is damn baby You make a sista want to come to Houston every All-Star weekend! YOU DID THAT Sure wish we could have been blessed with your presence a while longer? We had a>hell of a time with you. Reading your book is not helping. Why am I> reading this book and I feel you are reading this book to me and it is just>like I am having passionate love with you in every steamy sex scene. Was that the plan for ladies all over the country to experience you through your writing. Or maybe because I had the pleasure of meeting you first hand. You are all over this book , your mannerisms , your tone , your aura(lol) I don't care what you say. YOU have at least etched your style in this.I have never experienced a writing style this unique and captivating. Not anything like it.>"
5,The way it is!!,Let me start off by saying this book will put things in such a real perspective it makes you feel like you are right there listening to and seeing things you may not want to see but deep down you really do want to know and feel what is happing to the charaters in the story. Its a story that just puts it right in your face you cant help but want to keep reading more and more. Kerry did a great job with this book i would recommend it to everyone. much love to you Kerry
5,What your face reveals,"This is a wonderful and excellent book to have for anyone who wants to know others better and deeper in a readily way, by just looking at the other's face. By reading this book thoroughly, you can read a person like a book without his or her knowing it. A great asset in life, indeed, it can save you a lot of time, money and trouble if that person has special relation --be it romantic, businesswise, or workwise--with you. Meanwhile, it is very interesting and revealing."
1,Stuff and Nonsense,"This book contains a list of alleged similarities between the Hebrew language and Hebrew scriptures on the one hand, and the Greek language and the New Testament on the other. The author's chosen examples are absurdly, fantastically off-point - for instance, the Hebrew word mishpacha (family) is likened to the Greek word sperma (seed). The vague similarity in sound is scarcely better than random (I can think of lots of words which have an ""s"" and a ""p""), and the meanings are sort of in the general area having to do with procreation; with this loose a standard, I doubt that there are unrelated words in any two languages."
5,Adam Green is God!,"Adam Green is THE most brilliant cartoonist in the world at the moment. Everyone should own this book, and ""What were you in a previous life?"". Please buy this book, and worship Adam on a daily basis. (I actually laughed in the book store as I was reading this book. Not a quiet chuckle either...a big psycho laugh. People stared.) Adam's brand of humor isn't for everyone. Some people just won't get it. If you understand the Far Side and Life in Hell, you'll dig his stuff. Even his signatures are funny! Do yourself a favor...track down any and all Adam Green titles and buy them!"
5,It's about time!!!,"I'm so excited they've finally re-released The Babys catalog. I've been a fan since the beginning. The music has held up remarkably well, it still sounds as fresh as it did twenty some years ago. I can't wait to get all the rest of the CD's."
4,An Emotion-Filled Mix of Ballads and Rockers,"Of all the 70s pop-rock bands, perhaps no other used string and horn arrangements as effectively as The Babys, and that especially holds true for the 1977 release, Broken Heart. Lead by vocalist John Waite's whispery voice, Broken Heart, which includes the hit, ""Isn't It Time"", moves along effortlessly from the first track to the last. An emotion-filled mix of intense ballads and smooth rockers, this is one of those albums that after each subsequent listen gets better and better."
2,For Women Only,"I purchased this book for my friend to help him understand what his kids were going through and help him learn to deal with a bitter ex-wife. I thought the book would offer solutions to co-parenting issues or offer advise on how to work with a less-than-amicable former spouse. Instead, this book focussed on women who were dealing with deliquent husbands - how to make them pay, how to keep them involved, etc. It would have been more helpful to additionally offer advise on how to make her share the kids, how to make her co-parent with him, how help her move beyond the fight of the parents to the health of the children. I know the roles can be reversed in either case, but the author obviously felt that women were more likely to nurture the children. This, unfortunately, is not always the case."
4,Practical Divorce Advice,"The book is short and to the point with little editorial message. It suggested three or four things that I would never have thought of in this difficult time of tearing apart our family. It's a good tool, quick read and affordable."
2,Message passible with some follow-up,"I really looked forward to buying this book as it was so close to Christmas and my eldest child was pointing to everything in the store and saying ""I WAAAANNT it!"" I'd hoped maybe the book would open a dialogue about not getting everything we want as well as donating to the needy (as this book was billed). While the little boy did end up giving away his toys to a shelter and he learned what he already had was more important than all the things he got - it took a horrible way to get there. And by the time we got to the final message - the little attention span had spent! We talked about the book and discussed it - and I think the final message got through - but with a lot of work. Although the illustrations were very good - this book is probably not worth your time. You could do more just talking with your child."
1,"Weak, weak, weak","I had heard about this book years ago, and thought the idea sounded good. Read it today, as I babysat my granddaughter, and it's awful!! Not only is the lesson so buried as to be impossible to discern, it's poorly written and boring besides. Big disappointment."
4,A Story Every Parent Recognizes,"Dr. Laura's hits the nail on the head in one respect in this book but misses the mark in another. Every time I go to a store with my two boys the same refrain comes through. In that sense this book therepy for parents who have gone through the unending chant. As a moral for children it is a good story. My oldest read it to our youngest as we left the bookstore after both of them were using its title as their battle cry. I don't know if the story made the proper impression, My take is although it is a good lesson and well drawn, it will take more than one book to teach this story, (Particulary with toys other than stuffed animals, I can't figure how you would frame it with shall we say star wars toys.) however it is a good effort readable and understandable by kids. But unfortunately to the dismay of parents everywhere understanding doesn't equal emulation, but its worth a shot."
1,very poor message,This is the worst childrens book that I have read. I would not recommend it to anyone. Would suggest to any parent to pre-read this book before reading it to your child.
1,What a joke!,"My wife bought it for our kids and brought it home. Before she got halfway into it, she returned it. I personally wouldn't bother reading anything by Dr. Lala, the homophobe. I don't want our children exposed to her pop b.s. The reason for the HIGH RATING is for the great illustrations. That's it."
1,"Good message, bad delivery","I think Dr. Laura's book has a good message, but she has delivered it in an unfortunate way. The books is about a child who cries and cries for certain items, and the parent gives in a buys them for the child--the message being ""If you have these items, does it satisfy you."" That is a fine message. However, I think Dr. Laura's writing is just a bit sloppy because that message gets kind of lost in all the crying and begging. This isn't great writing for children in the end; it's a good concept, poorly executed. The illustrations are nice, though. I decided to get rid of my copy of the book finally; the book is just too problematical. I wouldn't recommend that parents rely on it as a way of teaching your children this message, I think you can do better with real-life scenarios or hunting for better writers."
1,Not what I would do,Initial excitement over this book brought disappointment when I saw the Mother's solution included buying every toy the kid whined for. I'm afraid the real message of the story won't be absorbed by young children. Glad I left this one on the shelf.
1,Doesn't Work for Any Age,"I have to agree that the lesson that comes through is ""If you whine enough, you'll get it all."" Perhaps with a slightly older target group the more profound message of ""Having *stuff* is not really important"" would come through (there are some adults this would benefit). The text and illustrations are prepared for the very young, the underlying message is appropriate for an older group."
1,This was a waste of money....,"I was shocked when I actually read the book. In there, the fitful child actually GETS all the toys he fussed about in the store. The ending is idyllic. That a child, who is obviously prone to ""I want"" fits in a store, would somehow awaken to his own folly. In the middle of the night no less, after several times waking up. It is pure fiction. If you are buying this book to help stop your child of the ""I wants"", seek an alternate route."
1,Gives the wrong message!,"The fundamental message most children will take away from this book is that if you whine and whine and whine you'll get what you want. The parent in this story does this to solve the child's whining for objects. The abstract morality about ""things cannot bring you true happiness"" will be totally lost on your child and, in short, the message will backfire. Save your money on this title and explore better-thought-through plots in other children's books."
4,very good,"there was enough description of this product to convince me ,it was what i was looking for.This product did meet the expected standard."
1,Laptop Battery Replacement,"The battery was the correct fit, but right off it needed re-charging in less than 30-45 minuted. As I used it, and I only use my laptop once a week or less, it kept the charge less and less time. Then, within the first 20 days of receiving, it quit altogether except to run the laptop while plugged into AC current. I emailed this to supplier about 10 days ago, but I have heard nothing."
1,Wrong Product and bad quality,Wrong product delivered. Does not fit my laptop (vgn-sz650n)and very poor quality product/finishing. Better spend more and buy original from Sony. Regret I tried the gerenirc one. Money wasted
1,"Very unhappy, stopped working after three monthsBou","First I had to turn off the battery utility on my Sony Vaio VGN-S660. Otherwise it refused to even start with this battery. Once I had figured that out it worked fine for less than three months. One day it just stopped working. Not just die quickly. It shorted out the whole computer. Even when plugged in to AC the computer was unable to start when the battery was in place. No, I hadn' dropped it, banged it, or done anything that original battery hadn't seen and endured without complaining. Very unhappy."
5,Mind Saver!,"This book is good with anyone who is going through some spiritual warfare! It helps you take a good look at yourself; giving biblical references with a hint of ""Joyce"" in them to help break any strongholds the devil has set in your mind. This book was so good, I got my friend and family a copy and is planning to get the sequel ""Power Thoughts"". It is true, we are not in physical battle but in spiritual battle. God has so much for you, a greater plan in your life if you are willing to receive it. It's an eye opener to His lessons, good grace, and the devils many deceitful tactics."
5,Battlefield of the Mind,"This book is a Christian Classic, I'm so glad I finally read it. It is a fundamental textbook for walking the Christian Life in Victory."
5,Timely,"When I placed the order for the books, I was on a short time frame. The books arrived several days before I needed them. Thank you."
5,Battlefield of the Mind,This is an excellent book. I am re-reading it for the second time and sharing it with my study group.Thanks Joyce.
3,battlefield of the mind,I really enjoy this book it has great disscusion for group or book club of I participated on this read
1,"Not for a new Christian, lots of false doctrine.",I lead a bible study based on this book and spent most of my time correcting errors in the way the bible was interpreted with out the use of surrounding scripture. She is correct the battle does begin in your mind but this is not the book to use to correct your mind. Start with the bible. New Christians may not notice false doctrine so if you are looking to do a bible study on this book be prepared to do a lot of correcting.
5,not everyone's at a point where this book will be helpful,"To a certain degree, you have to be ready to read this book to get the most out of it. If I had read this book 2 years ago, it would not have helped me at all because I was not mature enough in my spiritual and biblical knowledge to even have a sense of problem with the constant negative ways that I was thinking...in a way, it was a runaway, out-of-control thinking.This book has helped me to identify the problem and seek God's word and the Holy Spirit to help me. It's not a quick read bec/ one has to really digest what she is saying, but nevertheless, it's a great source of information for people who are ready to change their lives in a positive way."
5,Battlefield of the mind,Good reading and helpful to me....would tell everyone to read this book if you want to get your mind fixed
3,Too much Bible Beating,"I think I mis-understood this product.It was reccomended tome,but when reading I felt that there was just too much scripture quoted. I did not get out of it what I expected.I would have gotten more out of the Bible, because you expect that from it.Sorry,cannot reccomend.I bought the book,andthe book on tape."
5,JOYCE MEYERS DID IT AGAIN!,"GREAT BIBLE STUDIES BOOK FOR MEN, WOMEN & COUPLES. VERY ENLIGHTENING & HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND YOURSELF IN WAYS YOU NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE."
4,Very Insightful,"It is a great book,learned a lot of what negative thinking brings to your life. Joyce has a way of breaking it down for everyone to understand and relate to the different types of thinking that is present in your mind. She states the problem and then gives the solution. This encouraged me to evaluate my thinking and become more positiveand assertive in my attitude as well as my actions. She has inspired me to keep on keeping on. Through the midst of whatever problem you are facing keeping your mind peaceful and full of God's word will help you stay strong and well grounded."
5,"Thank You, Joyce!!!",I'm a daily viewer of Enjoying Everyday Life and I heard Joyce Meyer speak about this book. I bought the Kindle edition of the book. It explains (from a Christian point of view) why certain things happen to you. Why you think the way you think and what happens when you think that way.
5,worth reading,this book should be read by all. it is a good way to look on how powerful the mind is and how what you think can affect your actions and the way you live your life. it's also a good way to understand how God wants you to think and live your life without the anxieties of life.
5,Battlefield of the Mind,"I purchased seven books of Battlefield of the Mind by Joyce Meyers for a women's bible study. I purchased used books and all of them were in perfect shape. This book was used in a class for women overcoming addictions. It's a great book for anyone who wants to change their attitude and negative thinking. You ARE what you think! And if you don't like who you are then change your ""stinkin thinkin""! Joyce tells you how.Marlene Willyard"
5,This book is unbelievable,"A friend of mine suggested that I read this book as I was experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety over the issues that life generally presents. This book is changing my life by teaching me how to change my thinking, how to obtain a positive outlook and how to better incorporate God and His word into my life. I highly reccomend this book, it is working miracles for me."
3,Great reference,I loved this book because sometimes you know what you NEED to do to fight but don't have the tools. This book really provided tools on what I need to do to fight and conquer negative thinking. I love the biblical references and I feel like I can refer to this book over and over again. Thanks Joyce for a wonderful book!
5,Arrived early...excellent quality,Ordered fourteen copies for a Sunday School class study. Shipping was during the busy Christmas holiday rush. Material arrived days earlier than target. Each copy was excellent condition. Price was outstanding. Extremely satisfied overall.
5,this is a must read for anyone who struggles,"This book, written by my favorite author, teaches us how our minds can cause us to see things in the wrong way. It deals with fear, people pleasing and low self worth. Yet, this book is written for anyone! I feel mostly happy but want to grow in the Lord and this book is helping me. The subject matter also deals with people who may have deeper struggles and is also applicable for them! I would say this book is for anyone who is spiritual or anyone who wants to learn more about themselves and their creator."
4,Battlefield of the Mind -Inspirational Spiritual Maturity!!,Hew would you like to be really set Free? I would get this book then by J. Myers and read it for she breaks things down with what we all need to have and that is a mind that is totally and completley set Free.. I have to say it get's to the heart of the matter and shines light on the problems! Great Educational and spiritual Book!!
4,It was a gift for my daughter-in-law. But I like everything Joyce Meyer does.,"This book was highly recommended. It didn't disappoint either of us. I have read other books by Joyce, and this one is one of her best."
4,Laptop Lite,"This lite is great for my laptop, very inexpensive and arrived before it was supposed to. I love this lite."
5,The Battle is in the Mind,Battlefield of the Mind is a book like no other- It pulls the reader into an intimate engagement with the mind...you actually stop to think about what you are thinking about...it teaches you how to train your mind to stop negative thinking patterns and implement positive ones. We can actually control what we think...I highly recommend it!
4,Important insights!,"I read Battlefield of the Mind:Winning the Battle in Your Mind ""100 Devotions"" first. The full book became a must read."
2,On Awareness,"The more you resist something, the greater power you give to it. That's the meaning, I think, of Jesus' words: ""When someone strikes you on the right cheek, offer him your left as well."" You always empower the demons you fight. That's very Oriental. But if you flow with the enemy, you overcome the enemy. How does one cope with evil? Not by fighting it but by understanding it. In understanding, it disappears. How does one cope with darkness? Not with one's fist. You don't chase darkness out of the room with a broom; you turn on a light. The more you fight darkness, the more real it becomes to you, and the more you exhaust yourself. But when you turn on the light of awareness, it melts.For a different perspective on this matter, I recommend Anthony De Mello's book, Awareness."
3,Great Book; Long time on Delivery,I didn't realize that this book was coming from the UK. But glad I got it. Started reading it several days ago.
5,Battlefield of the Mind,"Eventhough I have not read all of the book yet, if the rest is as good as where I have read up, then it istruly a blessing to me. Wonderful author with awesome words to help to change lives."
5,Awesome book!,"This is a great book, as are all Joyce Meyer books!!!! Easy to read and understand. I would highly recommend!!"
5,Practical points for winning the battle of the mind,This is an easy read with practical points you can apply to your life. I will read it more than once.
4,Battle with Satan,"I really like the easy read of this book. I am not much of a reader, I mostly listen to books on tape, but I have been able to read this and have gotten a lot of ideas out of it. It has been very helpful to me and I am getting back to my old self and that makes myself and my friends very happy. Thanks to Joyce Meyer for all her help with my fight, it is good to find out that I am not alone."
5,Everyone Should Read This!,"This book by Joyce Meyer is excellent and provides the needed information that all people need. It is written in an ""easy to understand"" style and can be applied to one's life immediately. Hope and confidence are attributes of this writing. Thanks, Joyce."
5,Excellent,"I just love how Joyce talks on a level I can understand and apply to my life. This is a great book for renewing the mind, breaking bondages and strongholds and finally getting free from the condemning talk in our heads. Highly recommended reading."
4,Joyce!,Another great and very inspiring book from Joyce Meyers. This book is an awakening - it forces you to really examine what's on your mind!
5,This book changed my life!,"Joyce Meyer is one of my favorite authors and speakers. I have been profoundly changed by how God speaks to me through her. ""Battlefield of the Mind"" clearly showed me how the thoughts I meditate on will feed my soul, and that God's Word is truly life-giving and life-changing! I've recommended this book to friends who are struggling with depression. What a testimony to be able to say it is helping them too. Add this one to your collection, and refer to it often! Mary Singer Wick, author of ""My Heart's Desire: A Journey Toward Finding Extravagant Love""."
4,Battlefield for the mind,"I ordered a case of the books. I had to send back a couple defective books. The pages on 10 of them were nice and crisp white and the pages of 2 of them were an older version of the book which was frustrating to me. I'm happy with most of the books, minus the hassle with the defective ones that had ripped covers, etc."
5,Everybody should read this book!!,This book should be read by everyone. Their is truth in this book and we all know that the truth will set us free. So get free-read this book!
2,The book was less than good,"I was new and accidently bought 2 books instead of one, and couldn't do anything about it, because it was a private buyer. I tried"
4,Battlefield of the Mind,"The book was used, as they said it was, but it had something sticky on it as well."
3,Love the book. Narrator is bad. It will put you to sleep,"I love JM and I love this book. I like audio because I have a long drive to work. However, this book is extremely hard to listen to because the narrator has this soft kind of airy voice and it makes me sleepy. I can't think of the term, but her voice rarely changes inflection and it has a lulling effect. This is information worth paying attention to. You don't want to have your mind wandering when you should be listening intently! Maybe it would be better if I wasn't driving, but then I would have bought the actual book. Oh well."
3,Battle to read,"Although I believe this topic needs to be tackled (every Christian battles with negative, ungodly thought), Meyer seems to jump around in her logic, trying too hard to prove her point without enough supporting detail. I had high hopes for reading this book and sharing it with my husband and friends, but it lacks examples and is redundant. On the contrary, the major positive is her extensive use of Scripture."
2,Typical Charismatic,"Everyone should check the 'pedigree' of the author of any book. I failed to do this because I listened to her a couple of times. Those times, she was 'right on.' (Seemed to be accurate) But after buying the book, I found out that she was a Charismatic person and relects the Charismatic beliefs which I do not share. Later we watched her and had to turn the TV off because we could not stand what we were hearing.....because it was so far removed from the teachings of scripture.Now, I am not saying that the lady is not a Christian because I think scriptures come from all walks of life; but her beliefs are radically different from ours. But she has been in trouble with the government (IRS) and her taking of excessive money from the ministry is to me a real question of rather she is viable in any arena.The book is a hodge podge of charismatic 'mess'....if you please and this is from a person who was a practicing Charsmatic christian long before she ever got involved in it."
3,Battlefield of the Mind,"When I asked my nephew what to get for his sister for Christmas, I was at a loss when he recommended a Joel Olsteen book. (Not a fan). But I had heard alot of good things about Joyce Meyer and felt it was probably a safer alternative."
4,Like book confused by her fox news statement???...,"I love! Joyce Meyer....but I was confused by her statement on a Fox News show this past week...she stated that ....she loves Fox News and the ""Truth"" they tell....huh???....Now I don't know what to think...I'm confused!...I wish that our beloved Pastors would stay out! of dirty! filthy! Politics!!!...it shows that they preach to us one thing...yet some times believe something totally different then we believe...sad sad sad....it's sad if she really believes that ...they tell the...""Truth""...sad sad sad.But Buy the book and DVD...because the truth! in it will set your mind free...I pray she reads her own book."
5,It's making a difference for me,I just started the book and am through the first section. I'm so happy my Bible Study chose this book. It's making a difference for me in my thinking and my life. Thanks so much Joyce!! I don't see how any person could not benefit from reading and applying the message to their thinking and their life.
3,Not labeled correctly,"This singer on this CD is the incredible Puerto Rican singer, Daniel Santos, probably with the great Cuban band La Sonora Matancera (not sure about the band). For a better deal, buy El Jefe: 30 exitos. It has 30 songs, including these. Daniel Santos always gets 10 stars from me, but this CD isn't worth the money. There are better compilations of Daniel Santos available."
5,great for review and reference.,"I passed my CPAN exam using this book primarily. Very organized and direct to the point. The pharmacology part of it helped me a lot. Caution on mg vs Microgram on dosages part 3 chapter 16, troponin I normal range of < 3.1 page 280 , most references use < 0.6-1.5, and the wave forms on page 705 and page 703 has the labels the other way around. Aside from the above that I could remember, I rate the book at 5 stars (0-5 scale). I even enjoyed studying the endocrine / hormonal topics of the book - I usually dont. I got a > 100+ score above group average on the exam and I know this book has a lot to do with it. Thank you Kim and all your associates who helped you on this book."
4,A Pleasant SHort Read for a Weekend at the Beach!,"I usually do not read fiction, but I was pleasantly surprised by this book. The stories are short and very well written. I especially liked, ""Where No Flowers Bloom"", ""The Albacore Fisherman"", and ""Death of a Hero""! Great read for a visit to the beach or seaside village."
2,"this book has its points, but...","This book has an interesting subject and lovely photography. I am sympathetic to the plight of gentrification. However, the tone of this feels as though she were a professional complainer. Neighborhoods change, that is a fact of life. The residents who were displaced in this book were undoubtedly not the same residents from the time it was built. You get the sense that the author feels like everything about every neighborhood is worth saving. It isn't. I'm not going to cry about a neighborhood with less crime. And what solutions are offered? Should one never try to improve a distressed neighborhood, so that no one ever has to move? What sort of building *should* be allowed in a city? Ms. Solnit has some very valid points in this book, but she comes off as anti-change and not really offering anything close to a solution, other than fossilizing San Francisco in the ""good old days"", whenever that was for her."
3,meh....,"This is a pretty nice looking item...butthe ""blue sapphire gems"" are just little blue plastic beads... i knew they weren't going to be genuine gems, but glass would have been nicethe scabbard and handle are mostly plastic.the blade is pretty good... and looks niceso for only 15$ I'd say it was a good buy, with a few cheesy sidesbut I'm not complaining"
4,4711 for men nice but doesn't last,"This splash is great, however, after you get a lift from its citrusy fragrance and an all over clean and worldly feeling, it doesn't last which is my only complaint. I use another splash called Royal Ambree by Legrain (from Spain) and it does last so that's how I made the comparison. It stays on my clothes and layers well with other scents if I get creative.If you've never tried it before, you won't be sorry, it's excellent but disappointing as to its strength and length of time you can enjoy it, hence the four stars.If you're into a body splash that has an excellent aroma and you enjoy the lightness of its character, this is for you."
4,Great scent!,"Bought it for my husband for Christmas and he loved it. He had worn this cologne before and had been talking about it for a while. It has a clean, ""fresh out of the shower"" scent that lingers for a long time."
4,good stuff,"always liked this item, was introduced to me when I lived in West Germany, and used it ever since. Nice pleasant and refreshing"
5,4711,"Love the 4711, i was looking for so long for this sent, its cause when i was working for marlon brando he walked up to me and was talking to me and the sent that i just fell in love with it and i did not ask him, so now i am living with the niece of marlon i ask her what did he us and she told me 4711 and she has some to,and that was his favorite body splash when he got out of the shower, and now i got it and i LOVE IT!! so muchTHANK YOU SO MUCH"
3,Good for a few months,we bought 30 of these its a great way to bring awarness to a dibetes research. All though magnets are a little over priced.
3,You're lookin' good now.,"KFWB was (and still is) a Los Angeles based radio station. This album features surf instrumentals. The odd thing is, a lot of the tunes here have the wrong title. ""Vesuvius"" is really ""Pipeline"", ""Get It"" is really ""Last Night"", ""Tor-Chula"" is really ""Hot Pastrami"" and ""Revellion"" is really ""Surfin' USA"" (and those are just the ones I recognized off of the top of my head). Anyway, most of these surf instrumentals are pretty good, if unexceptional. ""Driftin'"" (if that's the actual title) is an interesting blend of surf music and the blues, which makes it stand out a bit. Overall, this is an average surf album."
5,This is a great book to introduce children to milk productio,"We took this book out from our local library and found it to be so good we are buying it! My husbands family were dairy farmers and we try to educate our daughters about dairy farming as much as possible. This book give enough educational detail about cows and milk production to be informative for a young child and encourage discussion about cows and the process of milk production. I recommend this book to anyone with a young child interested in cows, milk or farming."
5,Mooo Moooo,"""The Milk Makers"" is a Moo-masterpiece when it comes to educational value it scores big! The illustrations are simple the text is clear for even young toddlers and lets face it adults are sure to learn something new as well. I picked this book up after I found out how well it described the milk process cause as far as my daughter is concerned sure she knows she drinks ""cows milk"" but the process in which it goes through from the cow to the supermarket is huge and she was purely in the dark about it. This book is sure to be a crowd pleaser for inquisitive little minds!"
1,Collins Robert French/English-English/French Unabridged Dictionary,"The name of this book is very misleading. It sure is not unabridged the way I would want. Compared to other unabridged dictionaries I own. As soon as I received it I could see something was wrong. The book measures 10.5"" x 8"" x 2.5"" Hardly the size of a full unabridged dictionary. It's just an unabridged version of the first printing. I did keep it for a backup. It was also way overpriced."
5,A Must for College French Students!!!,Anyone taking college French will improve their grades by using this book. It's that good and helpful.
1,A Grave Disappointment,"Long-time fans of Seven Nations may find themselves confused and disappointed by this bland homogenized mix of very short songs. While I've enjoyed their music for a long time, I find almost nothing to praise in this offering. In a departure from their other work, the guitar figures prominently, the pipes are missing in action, and Kirk's vocals are oddly muted. It appears Seven Nations is reaching (cautiously) for the big time. While I have no problem with the lack of ""traditional"" music, it seems the group has turned its back on everything that made their music distinctive and compelling."
2,And Now It's Come to What??,"If this is what it's come to, I'm not very interested in hanging around for the ride. I've loved the band since I first heard them while unpacking boxes at work, but listening to this album just leaves me feeling pretty empty. Wonderful is a pretty interesting song lyrically and musically, and I can find something to like about the re-worked version of ""God"" (now entitled ""Up to Me""). Other than that, I really don't care for this album at all. Had this been the first I'd heard of 7N, I never would have become a fan. I liked the band for their energy, originality, and the escape from radio-mush that they provided. Unfortunately, almost all of that is gone. This may be their most radio-friendly album to date, but at what cost? If you haven't heard 7N before, this is not the album to buy. Check out some of their earlier offerings (Big Dog, Seven Nations, The Pictou Sessions) for some really rocking original tunes."
3,Close but not all there.,"Seven Nations is in a tough place of trying to combine Traditional Irish music with rock and roll. It seems with this release they are confused about the direction of the band. I have been an avid fan of them for years and have seen them many times live. To me they seem to be loosing their sense of Irish music, this album does not deliver that same mix of traditional plus rock as their previous albums have. I understand that bands sometime go in new and different directions, but I think this is the wrong road for them to go down.If this seems a harsh review I apologize. I love there music and have had the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with them (they are all great guys). I just hope that they can get back to bridging the gap betweeen tradtional and rock. It is obviously not an easy task to become a commercial success this way and few bands have done it. But Seven Nations have and I believe that they can still continue to do this."
1,Seven Nations no More,"If you're reading this, you have already read quite a few raving reviews of this album. This isn't one of them.I have followed Seven Nations since they were known as Clan na Gael, almost 10 years now. I'm a founding life time member of the fan club. If you are looking for Bagpipes & Guitar, traditional and skillful piping, this isn't it.Put simply, they've sold out. They're now about as Celtic or Scottish/Irish as the Boston Celtics. Gone are the 'pipes, gone is the emotion, excitement, the energy.There's not one song on this CD I'll list to again. It's not that they are bad songs, they're not, they're just not Seven Nations. Here's a clue guys: if I wanted to listen to this type of music, i'll pop Dave Matthews, Creed, or Incubus in - and they do it better than you do.Put the kilts back on, pick up the 'pipes, and do what you do best, don't try and be something your not in an already glutted marked."
1,Eject,"It would give me no greater pleasure than to say what a wonderful album this most recent release from 7N is. But the fact of the matter is, this is not a great or even a good album.After having seen them perform live many times since 1997, and even as recently as this weekend in Chicago (where they played 55 minutes of a show that was supposed to be 1 1/2 hours long, after starting 15 minutes late), I was immensely dissapointed. They sound like every other rock/pop group that say they are different, but in reality are not. If you want REAL Celtic Rock music, check out ""The Young Dubliners"". As for this album, it's come to this...it will be stored in the circular filing cabinet."
3,Is this the same band I saw live?,"I saw them live in Boston and had a great time. But this cd doesn't sound remotely like the band I saw that night. Where the hell are the pipes and fiddle? Where are the raucous dance tunes? I understand when an artist doesn't want to be pigeonholed, but don't advertise yourself as a celtic rock band if your studio work falls somewhere between Hootie and that annoying guy from high school who always brought his guitar to the parties."
1,Don't Buy This Album,"You will be disappointed--unless you like fairly non-descript rock. There is nothing Celtic about this album--I can see why Dewar's dropped sponsorship. On the other hand, it makes a great coaster!"
2,A disappointment,"I looked forward to the new album with great anticipation. I own all of their albums. With Seven Nations unique style; choice of instruments, and Celtic melodys set them apart from all other groups. However, their performance in this album makes them sound like every other generic ""garage/grunge"" band."
3,Good BUT NOT Traditional 7N,"while I agree with some of the reviews (good and bad), I'm also aware that these guys are in this AS THEIR JOBS. Sure, it looks all glamorous but be real here, they travel an un-Godly # of days/year working clubs all over hell & creation. You think that's just for the hell of it?? Gimme a break. Yes, they love their music (as do we) BUT, they are trying to make a living at the same time. I don't think this CD is nearly as good as Old Ground (my favorite) but it's good in it's own right. It's definitely MUCH MORE mainstream and if it lets them track to a larger following, GOOD FOR THEM, GOOD FOR ALL OF US! We'll hear more from them and once they get a bigger following can start pulling some of their old stuff back in as well. I say give them the benefit of the doubt...enjoy this one FWIW from an excellent band."
2,Not at all what I had hoped,I had such high hopes of hearing good Irish music first and foremost and just good music in general and was sorely disappointed. This band is a joke. I saw them live in Winnipeg and it further cemented my dislike for this group. We couldn't help but make fun of them the whole time. This is just the same old same old crap every other mediocre pop novelty band is putting out only the others do it better. If you were looking for cutting edge Irish rock and roll this isn't it. Go look at Lunasa or Flogging Molly instead.
5,A great story and very well told - a classic.,This is one of the first 'good' SciFi books I came across as a teenager. The quality of the story-telling and the 'mood' created by the characters and the setting were quite memorable. I love this type of story-line but have never been able to find another book that really comes close. I will be dusting off my old copy and reading it very soon.
5,A terrific read! a very real and emotional story!,This book is outstanding. I want to save it and give it to my kids to read when they get older. I agree with all the other folks when they say this is a classic. It was given to me by a friend who insisted I read it. I owe her one!
5,I never read books ever and this is the one to read,I never read books ever and this is one of the ones that I have read thru from cover to cover. It kind of refers to life in a way to a way it can trufully end up in the future. Very believable
2,To Kill a Make Nine,"Tevis's novel, although originally published in 1980, has an innocent and naive tone reminiscent of SF from the 40s and early 50s. The prose style is simple and unpretentious, the events that befall the protagonists never particularly extreme. These factors are not criticisms but simple observations. But there are major problems with this novel. The story is underdeveloped and the characters tepid and uninspiring. I was never really convinced by the society Tevis posits: there are just too many incongruities and implausibilities for it to ring true. Without doubt MOCKINGBIRD contains the kernel of a fascinating examination of humanity, mortality, and the role technology should be allowed to play within our lives, but unfortunately Tevis fails to realise its promise."
3,Its ok,"I thought this book would have more information in it. Its good for basic organic courses...but even then, you could do better at the library. Quite disappointing"
2,Its ok!,"My 6 sting broke after the second day, I dont know if it was the sting or I put it wrong but I it dint last much! Not happy!"
4,DiAddaro Nylon Guitar Strings,Happy with the timeliness of receiving the the package. No damage to the items in the package. Would do business with this seller again.
4,Good strings.,"The silver plated strings look good, play well, and don't age as fast as a bronze string. I like the composite G-String that they have in these packs, I think they sound better than the fat nylon strings they used to use."
4,Strings bent,"I normally use Ernie Balls, but since this is my first classical guitar, I decided to try D'Addario's for my initial string change. Ernie Balls are always nicely rolled, and the strings come out straight once you unroll them. I've never had classical guitar strings before, so I don't know if all brands end up bent, but the D'Addario's were. Once I had them strung up and tuned, it didn't matter. Just a little quirk I didn't like."
4,"Higuchi JCR 8297 - 10 Watt MR11 Light Bulb, 12 Volt, 40 Degree Flood",Glad I finally found this bulb on line. It was a replacement for my fiber optic Christmas tree. First Christmas I have been able to use my tree in several years.
3,"Pretty decent, but a little uneven and no cover glass.","One star removed for a moderately uneven pattern. But it is OK for non-critical applications.One star removed for not having a glass over the front, leaving the lamp and reflector to collect dust and fingerprints in many applications."
3,No cover.,"I am not sure how this will last with the heat, dust, etc without a cover over the bulb. I did not see the second user-edited photo until after I received the bulb. Still lit up and works fine for now (day two)."
3,"NOT ""QUITE"" THE EXACT REPLACEMENT PART (PROBABLY MY FAULT) BUT NONE-THE-LESS IT WORKS GREAT.","NOT ""QUITE"" THE EXACT REPLACEMENT PART (PROBABLY MY FAULT) BUT NONE-THE-LESS IT WORKS GREAT. IT DIDN'T HAVE A ""PROTECTIVE"" LENS ""COVER"", AS DID THE OLD PART, WHICH IN ORDERING THIS PART, WAS MOST PROBABLY MY FAULT IN SELECTING THE WRONG PART/MODEL NUMBER. HOWEVER, IT WORKS JUST FINE, THE PRONGS FIT, IT'S PLENTY BRIGHT, ETC., ETC.."
5,Just Right!,"The light that I ordered was just perfect. I ordered it to fix a small decorative Christmas tree. The light arrived promptly, the price was very fair, and it works great!"
2,No glass cover on the MR11 light bulb sold by Light Bulbs Etc on JAN 2012,"There's no glass cover on the MR11/12v/10W light bulb sold by Light Bulbs Etc on JAN 2012, seller should have put ""uncovered"" or ""no glass cover"" in item description, but they didn't. Without a glass cover, it's so easy to break the quartz envelope (the center compartment where light is emitted), and you can feel the heat released by the light bulb immediately once the light bulb is on. Now I'm worried that this uncovered MR11 light bulb might melt or over heat my pre-lit fiber optic Christmas Tree (light bulb has to be installed in the plastic base compartment)."
1,steering wheel cover,"Steering wheel cover fit pretty good but the smell off the vhynal was way too much to tolerate and I removed it. I put the cover in the garage so that maybe it could airout somewhat. No, I don't recomemd this item to anyone period!!"
1,What's that smell?,"Okay, if this rating were to be based on form & fit alone, it would be a 4 or 5 star rating. But a strong rubbery, chemical smell hits you the moment you take it out of the box. I figure the smell will dissipate and leave it in the garage for a few days -- no change. Undaunted, I squeeze the cover onto my steering wheel (Toyota Highlander) and it fits pretty well and feels comfortable -- maybe I can live with the smell. But there is a sticky, oily residue covering the entire cover, except for the gel portions which are on the sides (from about 2 to 4 o'clock, and again from 8 to 10). I tried wiping the residue from the cover, but no luck, it's totally embedded. I have since removed the cover from the wheel and will let it sit in the garage. If the smell and oily residue go away (seems unlikely) I'll re-review this product ... until then, my advice is stay away!"
3,The Missing Piece(s),"Fat +/-2,500 page book with very, very thin pages a few which might be too large and need trimming and a few pages may be crinkled and wrinkled...but still a good source to use if you are teaching children's literature in spite of The Missing Piece(s). I am curious and wonder the reasons why I didn't find any mention of the Rey's and their monkey, George, and especially surprised that there is NO mention of Shel Silverstein and his many classics which have sold in the millions. What 'kid' doesn't know Where The Sidewalk Ends, Light in the Attic, The Giving Tree, Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back...and the extra special posthumously published and cleverly illustrated Runny Babbit (that ought to receive the Caldecott Medal!) Some other missing pieces that would have been very helpful would be a list of the Caldecott and Newbery Medal winners and runners-up."
4,Get this!,"An anthology that leaves no stone unturned. This should be considered for use in library studies, childrens' literature courses and post grad studies. Bravo- a resource that we can hold deep in our hearts and minds."
4,Thank You,"The book proved to be very useful and appropriate for my course. Thank you for the book, great great help!"
3,Nice add to the collection,"I liked the different versions of my favorite fairy tales. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to connect to their youth.,"
3,What I expected,This book came in the condition that was stated. It also came before the time that it said it was supposed to be arriving. Probably will use this seller again.
1,Terrible Sub-Titles - A Disappointing Film At Best,"I'm not sure about the film some of these other reviewers saw, but I could not stand this movie.For one thing - one very critical thing - it's got some of the most UNREADABLE subtitles ever!Which, I'm sure, added to my complete lack of enjoyment.I'm an Independent Film fan and I was looking forward to seeing this movie but it's disconnected and at times, just unwatchable.The story meanders and the lighting isn't so great either.I was very disappointed.Be careful if you're planning on purchasing this DVD.Try to rent it first - check the foreign section of your favorite video store.Best Regards, turtlex"
5,Makita BHP451,Excellent tool lots of power and lightweight I let my buddy use it and he swears by dewalt for his construction crew. He was impressed enough to buy a couple
5,best cable modem out there!!!!!!,The SB5120 cable modem is easy to setup and have been getting the fasttest downloads that I have ever gotten. Much faster than any of my older modems. The downloads are great. I would recomend this to everyone.Motorola SURFboard SB5120 - Cable modem - external - Hi-Speed USB / Fast Ethernet - 38 Mbps
1,Comcast could not provision,"Yes, even thou this unit is given as a rental by comcast, they could not provision the unit I bought. 2 hours latter, no luck, I switched to a Linksys and provisioned in 2 minutes."
4,Good replacement Modem,"The first one failed in a week, BUT the second one is still truckin along good."
2,Speed drop after 9 months,"It worked fine after 9 months then certainly, my 3Mbps became 200kbps. Called my provider to troubleshoot the problem. It turned out to be the modem.Called Motorola to have it replace. Costed me $11 to have a new one sent to me and I've to pay shipping both ways. They replaced with the SB5101 model. The technician told me the only different is the firmware and they're out of stock on the SB5120. It carries a 2-year warranty. Make sure you turn in your warranty card to Motorola. You may need it."
5,"Great modem, works with Comcast cable internet","Rather than pay Comcast $3 a month for a modem that would not be updated during the duration of my service contract, I purchased the SB5120. It took the tech about 30 minutes to figure out how to set it up, but once set up it works quite well.I would definitely recommend this to friends, family, or strangers."
4,"Its fine, really fine...","I heard wild stories that if I bought an HP Surfboard, my bandwidth would double, perhaps triple! - I had people I knew making the same claims. I couldn't resist. I bought one... What did I find?It seems to be a capable modem, but as far as speed goes, not really any faster (perhaps even a tad slower) than the Linksys modem I had previously been using - I do like the feature that will take the internet connection offline at the push of a button.Downdside is that my Linksys modem and wireless router would stack nicely one on top of the other - now I have a larger footprint to deal with albiet a small one.If you are looking for a good modem that will do everything you want a cable modem to do, there is nothing I can find wrong with the HP Surfboard. If you already have a modem and are looking to wildly increase your bandwidth, I would take the claims (not from HP BTW) with a grain of salt."
5,Good product,Product works well. It's what the cable company was leasing to me. I bought one in order to cancel the lease fees.
1,Wrong unit received....,"Label on the casing is SB5120, the front label is SB5101. When I hook it up, I found out this unit is really a SB5101 model. I did n't get the Model SB5120 that I bought. I will be returning this modem for sure...."
5,Works great,What can you really say about a cable modem? Time Warner wanted to charge me $4\month for the same modem. This one will pay for itself in 5 months. It is in great shape and works well.
2,Cheap components bring this modem down.,"The SB5120 is a horrible cable modem - I've had dropped connections and I can't even login to the web interface 90% of the time.. Motorola released the 5120 with cheap internal components, and you get what you pay for. Get a SB5101 instead."
1,modem was in bad condition and did not work!,"The modem was poorly wrapped in loose news paper and had scratches and was in very poor condition. When I attempted to connect the product several times, I realized that it did not work. What a loss and waste of money! I would not recommend this product to anyone!"
4,does what it supposes to do,"does what it supposes to do, no problem with it. Look like new. I received everything, I did need to buy other thing to make it work."
4,Good Service,I got issues with the initial delivery but this vendor is very good in its service. They immediately sent me replacement. I would recommend themThanks
4,Solid modem,"This modem does what you want it to do, exactly how it should. I can't complain, there really isn't too much to discuss about straight up cable modems. I take away one star for how heavily they advertise the docsis on this modem even though most ISPs do not support it. Don't expect the extra speed (especially 20x, that makes me laugh and laugh some more), but if you have DOCSIS supporting ISP, don't get a modem that doesn't take advantage of it. In short, solid modem, but some misleading advertising. I purchased this in case my ISP decides to use DOCSIS."
3,I See No Difference,"Since purchasing the SB5120 Surfboard by Motorola, I have noticed no difference in performance from my previous Motorola Surfboard. For me, a waste of money."
1,Honesty is the best business,"I asked for a specific model to go from my computer to the telephone line to get the internet, it was a Motorola modem and I got the wrong model. He was not honest enough to be with me that the model that he sent was discontinued and it was still sent to me and Motorola has not sold it for a long time. The seller was not honest about the order. He knew it was discontinued because I called Motorola and he sent it to me anyway. Motorola has not supported the model for a long time. It would be nice if he was honest with his customers before he sends merchandise. I do not trust this man. I contacted him and he did not respond."
3,"great item, wrong store","I am sure it's a good item, i never got the chance to try it, but when i tried to return it to the store with all the procedures necessary, it just got ignored and sent back, so not to good of an experience, the fact has to be said that this item was bought ""through"" amazon, not ""from"" amazon, but still same experience, there was no way of tracking the ""third party"" store or their actions.So all and all i don't like to shop through amazon to much, try to avoid it if i can, amazon is becoming more and more a ""wanna be ebay"" kind of store, but they don't seem to be able to offer the services that comes along with it."
5,Motorola SB5120 Cable Modem,"An excellent product. Switches on/off cable instantaneously and handles down/uploads at any speed presented by the cable. It has been used with direct Ethernet connection and also through a wireless router; the USB connection has not been used. The first SB5120 I used was rented from my cable company (don't know if it was new or refurbished) and ran for 2.5 years before developing a problem in the switch that shifts between active and standby modes. The cable company provided two other refurbished modems (different models) that failed to perform as well. Direct purchase was the only way to get another SB5120. Connection to the cable was essentially automatic, requiring a single phone call to transmit alphanumeric identification data."
5,Customer Service Was Tops,"I tend to rate a product not only by its success but also by its product support. Motorola has, by far, exceeded any expectations in this realm. Although my equipment has been flawless, my system had issues. Understanding that they can only provide support for their own unit, they were able to quickly and efficiently send me on my way towards the right path of resolution. The information provided by the customer service department cut the previous four hours of online service chat with other providers down to a five minute repair. It helps to know who to talk to first I suppose. With this in mind, a great product just became better."
5,Great Modem,"This modem is very easy and fast to set-up. Highly recommend, it took Comcast only 5 minutes to convert to this new modem. The speed is a lot faster, noticable difference."
1,Died in about 6 months.,"Thought it was my ISP, but turned out it was the modem. Buy something more reliable. Worked fine while it lasted, but no reason for it to die this fast."
5,Saved a bundle!,"We wanted to reduce our monthly internet cost by getting rid of the modem rental fee, but found them to be quite expensive if bought new. This modem was in excellent condition and works great -- a moneysaver all around!"
1,cannot use with comcast internet,I purchased this modem to use with my comcast internet seervice. It would not work. I had to purchase another modem in order for my internet service to work properly.
1,Did not work,Cable modem was worthless. Did not work. Ended up buying a brand new one. You get what you pay for I guess.
2,doesnt work properly,"I bought this modem but it disconnected the internet in between,not sure if this is a modem issue or network !!"
2,Rapid Decline,"I have Cox cable (don't like the company) and purchase this modem to replace an older Linksys, which Cox no longer supported. It kept dropping the connection the first day. Cox automatically updated the firmware over night and it stopped dropping the connection. The download speeds I was getting were okay at first, but got worse and the connection started to become intermitent. I figured I was having line level issues, but a Cox tech came out (one of the rare good ones they have), and replaced the modem with a Webstar. Everything has been great since then. Best guess is that there is some sort of shielding issue with this modem, at least the one I have."
4,Nice cable modem,"I bought this cable modem because I was concerned that Comcast would give me a low quality device to use. I have been using the Motorola Surfboard for a few weeks, and it has been trouble-free. My only complaint is that it is not practical to lay the modem on its side. It would be convenient for me to do so.Comcast only gives $3/month discount for customers who buy their own cable modems. Recently, I noticed one of these Surfboard cable modems on a counter in a Comcast billing center, too. So Comcast might be handing out these cable modems to their customers. If so, buying this gadget to save $3/month was a bad choice."
5,sleek and fast,"I am admittedly a novice when it comes to matters of technology but I know this modem is very easy to use and has a fast connection. In my last apartment, the landlord had a guy that took care of everything to do with the internet, I got this unit when I bought a house last winter. I don't even bother with Comcast C/S anymore, I just unplug all connections, wait a minute and plug back in. That seems to fix all connection problems I have ever had. I even connected the Surfboard to a Linksys wireless broadband router, piece of cake."
1,Modem Suffers from Premature Aging,"This modem worked flawlessly for 3 years. But, then as other reviewers have written, connection problems became more and more prevalent. It got to the point that every time I wanted to send an email or access the Internet; I'd have to power cycle the modem and hope that it could complete negotiation with my service provider.Electronic devices (with no moving mechanical parts) should last much, much longer than 3 years. When they don't, there are two primary causes - poor quality components and/or internal heat issues which prematurely age the components. The rapid aging of components due to excessive heat is calculated with a mathematical formula that can predict when a component will fail. Because these modems are dropping dead at the 3 year mark, I suspect that Motorola has a heat issue with these modems. There's no impetus to fix the design, as 3 years is way beyond the warranty period."
4,saves money on Comcast modem rental charge,"I should have brought this modem earlier, its the same modem provided by Comcast and charged $9 every month, i bought the used one for $25 (its even less now). now do the math of paying 9 bucks every month vs getting this for $20 one time."
5,Very fast - no problems,No problems - very fast and easy to set up. Doesn't take up much desk space and the one touch stand-by button is a nice feature.
1,SB5120 Surfboard Cable Modem Docsis 1.1 and 2.0 Certified USB,The unit sent t ome did not work after installation and set up with the cable company. I realize the unit was used. But they need to be checked out before shipping to a customer that they work. Very disappointed.
4,SB5120 SurfBoard Cable Modem,"The SB5120 SurfBoard Cable modem is a compact product that proved easy to install and use.The only problem I experienced was with my Cable Provider (Charter Communication) that required me to register its MAC address, then failed to set p the modem properly from their end.I took me several Support Calls before I could find a Charter Support person that was somewhat knowledgeable and was able to complete the registration. During these several days, my VoIP phone was unusable thanks to Charter!"
4,Pretty good at what it needs to do,I bought this used for about $30 instead of paying $3/mo to comcast. Worked great after some struggle.There was a little problem with comcast giving me internet connection when I replaced the modem. But I first connected the PC to the modem (instead of through a wireless router that I had placed in between before). Rebooted things Modem followed by PC) and everything worked fine.
5,Perfect service,"The modem arrived fast and in fine shape, as advertised, and works like it should. I appreciate the item and the service."
3,Beware Comcast!,"The SB5120 unit appears to work fine at first and Comcast had no problem provisioning it. The unit is also on the Comcast list of approved units.However, under any kind of heavy use, in my case playing the game Warhammer Online, the unit drops the network for 30 seconds which kills the game every five to ten minutes. It is extremely agravating. It will continue to drop the network all day long so it is not some type of network adjustment issue. I contacted Comcast and worked with someone for nearly an hour to no avail. I was forced to go back to an older Toshiba DOCSIS 1.1 modem as a result and wasted $35 on the Motorola unit.So that is my cautionary tale. Be careful before you spend the money on this item if you have Comcast."
