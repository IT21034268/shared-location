2,WHAT A BUMMER,"I bought LIVE AT THE RYNBORN ( simply awesome ) and couldn't wait to get my hands on more of his CD's. This was my second puchase and it is a major dissapointment. The power and enthusiasm that permeates his live CD is overwhelming and drags you along for the journey. It is BLUES at it's finest from a truely gifted blues man. This is average at best. Boring, cliche riddled songs without much originality. A voice that sounds out of context with much of the material and most surprising the guitar playing is full of flaws and half realized ideas. The tone ( one of the standouts on LIVE ) is grating at times and never reaches any hights. You need examples of this mans work to complete your BLUES collection as he is one of the best kept secrets in BLUES, but pleeeeeaaaase buy the LIVE AT THE RYNBORN cd instead. It is hard to believe that both emanated from the same artist."
3,another book on performance tunning,"i dunno. a book devoted to sport tunning a VW, i guess. for the new VW owner, who pays a dealer or tunning shop to mod out their cars, this book may very well be the bible of choice but for seasoned vets of the H20s this book is more like a pop up book with pretty pictures. my recomendation would be, if you have no idea how to do simple bolt ons like suspension, cams etc then get the book cuz you'll need a clue. but if you're handy with an impact wrench just by the bentley manual for you car and a couple of performance catalogs."
2,"If ALL you want is an aged look at the basics,this is your book!",There are SO many other more in depth and better written alternatives. Your continuing search for them will be rewarded!
3,Military railway,"Great reference book for anyone who had relatives in this service. My Dad served in the 735th Railway Operating Bn, 707th Railway Grand Division. The amount of unsung work these guys did is largely unknown today. This sheds a lot of light on their accomplishments and what it took to get the job done. Great pictures, good narrative."
5,Quality and Value,"Deluxe aptly describes this stool. Seat is 4"" of dense quality foam and covered in genuine leather. Easily adjustable height and wheels glide effortlessly making it very easy to control and move with the weight of your body. I use it to sit down while washing dishes or prepping vegetables. The stool legs are compact and do NOT stick out so far from under the seat as to cause you to trip. I am happily pleased with its performance and reasonable price."
3,good chess but poor translation,"This book contains some extraordinary games won by Bent Larsen, mostly during the sixties; the best part seems to be his account of some games he won during the 1964 interzonal in Amsterdam where he tied for first with (ex or future) world champions Tal, Spasski and Smyslov. His game with David Bronstein for exemple is breathtaking; however, the translator knew nothing of the chess world which is somewhat awkward."
1,run away,If I could give this item less than 0ne star I would. My son bought this camera with gift cards from his bday and was so excited. We get the thing home and you can only take 2 pictures - and get this - when you turn the camera off the are deleted! What is the purpose of even having a camera? So we get a SD card like it says. Now we can take 28 pictures (better) but it STILL deletes the pictures when you turn the camera off. What a waste * shaking head*
1,Worst Camera Ever!,"I agree with the review I saw above. I thought this would be a decent camera to give to my son. After the purchase of the camera and the extra card and the batterys, I was very disappointed. I could have bought a normal 110 camera for a LOT less and gotten 100x better pics. There is nothing easy about this camera. If you breath wrong it will distort the picture and you can never use the flash or it will turn every thing BRIGHT YELLOW. The worst thing is when you put the photos onto your computer and see how grainy the images turn out. Doesn't matter what pixel size you pick. The are all horrible. I will always pick a name brand camera in the future."
2,"Bad digital camera, ok if you need something very cheap","I needed a digital camera for the work I do. At the time I couldnt afford one and my mom gave her old one because she found one that was better. I found the camera to be horrible at pictures.For one it only has 4.1 mega pixils. Second if you want a video, it doesnt record sound. It takes horrible pictures in dimmed light room. In fact so much that its like taking pictures in a pitched dark room. The flash is too bright so the options are either a pitched black or bright white in some cases. It takes a little too long to actually take the picture, so the moment could have passed and you missed it.I wouldnt reconmend this camera, unless you cant afford a better one. It was what I needed for a bit but now Im planning on buying a new camera. Its better so spend an extra $50 or so and get a camera that has 8.2 mega pixels."
4,A Challenge To Focus Mission,"Wright is a skilled academic and researcher. He also is a man very committed to faith in action based on his deep understanding of the New Testament. For All God's Worth is Wright's call to all Christians to focus on worship and mission and to end divisive behavior. Wright recalls the healing and redemptive actions throughout the ministry of Jesus to illustrate how Christians should continue His work. He sees the redemptive consequence of Jesus as the Christians call to bring about the Kingdom Of God on Earth as it is in Heaven. Believers do this when they begin reflecting the one true God and not other gods of today.This book is an easy read and can be broken into parts (each chapter is about 25 pages). It will inspire clergy, academic, and layperson alike."
5,In My Top 10,"This book will find itself in my top recommendations (at least for a while). N.T. Wright's works are putting him in my favorite authors list. In this piece Wright tackles the subject of the Church and its mission.Because the Church is one of my passions, I read a lot about it. In this book, I was given a taste and glimpse so inspiring that I fell in love with what the Church could be all over again.If you are a follower of Jesus - this book will help crystalize what He invites us (His followers) to do and be in the world.Get it, buy it, read it, love it, live it."
5,SOME OF THE BEST BLUES WITH AN ALL GERMAN BAND,"This is blues at it's finest (Chicago style) great vocals & some fine blues guitar & harp. His band is very tight, and there all German except Al. The song selection is excellent, they play a lot of old American blues tunes. Al is paying tribute to a lot his mentors, like Muddy Waters & Otis Rush. He puts new life into these songs, everything is very well done. This one is sure to please the ears, and there is very little available from Al. So I highly recommend this cd, get it while you still can it has been out of print for awhile already."
1,Dreadful - forms wins out over function,"This looks like a cool gadget, and the self-cleaning swiper do-dah is a great idea. The catch - it really doesn't press garlic well. It smooshes it down, but yields very little through the holes. You can squeeze like crazy, and the handles (melamine?) actually feel like they might snap before you get a good clean squish of garlic popping out the other side. I'm an average size female with average strength in an average kitchen, and I can't get this sucker to work. My 99c metal garlic press from China does the job MUCH better. Do not buy this gadget, it is not worth it. If anyone from Kuhn Rikon would like to discuss this with me, I would love to. Come on you (normally) resourceful Swiss, you can do better than this."
1,Broke after 5 uses,"I love Kuhn Rikon, so I was disappointed that this garlic press was such poor quality. The cute green plastic handle just cracked and broke at the hinge after only a few days, making it the worst kitchen purchase I've ever made."
4,Baseball,"Little known player, but makes for a great story. This book should be reprinted. My son was interested in Pete Gray, but the only bio in print is too advanced for him. This book is perfect!"
5,music is the best...,This record is the bands finest and least accessible lyrically. Unless you speak Welsh.I don't know the language but my ancestors were from Cardiff.This one calms me. Rock on SFA!
4,Bonus tracks. . .uh. . .yah sure you betcha,"Gave it a 4 star only because all 5 bonus tracks have already been released on Jazz At The Black Hawk (7-8, 10-11) and Jazz At Storyville (9) but give it a five if you don't have either of theses LPs or the CDDave Brubeck/Paul Desmondwhich has these tracks as well.Or rate it 5 stars just for the historical content or just because you like the Bru.Since I have more than 100 Brubeck LPs and CDs these bonus tracks are just padding to me. . .and irritating, since there are other notable LPs and concerts that have never been kissed by the digital age. One notable with nary an LP or DVD or CD isDave Brubeckfrom the 1979 Newport Jazz Fest. Get it before it disappears."
4,Altogether good book,"This was a fine compilation of tales, with stories that though made no big impact on the history of the series, were interesting and in themselves nice diversions from life. ""Wanna Bet?"" was an excellent form of characterization that was fun to follow, and narration in these stories was surely what made most of these tales fun at all. My only problem with this was, I read about Kender, and I read about Gnomes, but I failed to find any Gully Dwarves in this story, so it received the rating that you yourself see above."
1,it tries to be funny but it isn4t,"This book has a one or two good stories, but the rest is plain bad. A lot of the stories attempt to be funny and yet they fail miserably. It is a dissapointment after reading the Dragon series books. Besides from the stories that try to be funny there are also some stories that try to trascend and present the reader with phylosophical ideas. Yet these efforts are laughable. Most stories are badly written, silly, and posses no relation what so ever with previous novels of Krynn."
3,Well....,I have to give all the short story novels 3 stars. There are some stories you won't like but they'll 2-4 really great ones that will make the books worth the price.
2,Not close to funny,"Kender, Gnomes, and Gully Dwarves had nothing to do with the hilarious creatures of Krynn. Most tales don't have a kender in them. The tales aren't horrible, but the name is very deceptive. Some tales such as ""The Definition of Honor"" are interesting (no Gully dwarves, Kender, and Gnomes). Most aren't even relevant to Kender. Just poor tales named to sell well."
1,A Joke,"This tape is a waste of time, it illustrates no knowledge of proper basics, or utilization and comprehension of the movements. I would recommend getting tapes from someone that actually understands the movements and basics, as ""Kenpo is the Science of Motion"""
3,Positive rock in a bland package.,"There's nothing wrong with Big Dismal's CD ""Believe"". But, you know you're in trouble when a review starts off with the ""there's nothing wrong..."" statement. There's also not a lot that really distinguishes it. A lot of people have decried the ""not another Creed rip-off"" while maintaining that they understand why such sentiments are out there; they're there because this band has some very similar sounds and deliveries as Creed. What they don't have, though, is the distinguished guitar of Marc Tremonti or the manic highs and the blow-me-down lows of Scott Stapp's lyrics. Though I will say that the lyrics are thoughtful and relatable, perhaps the strongest part of this album, the music doesn't quite kick up enough dust or serve the songs in a way that really helps them stand apart.If you're a fan of the types of bands that the Wind-Up label drops then you might like this. Otherwise, there are probably a lot more interesting listens out there for you."
4,Top on my list,"I haven't heard the entire cd but I've loved almost everything I've heard. Being a college student, I haven't bought it yet though I plan to as soon as I can find the extra cash. Honestly, out of all the cd's out that I don't have in my collection this is on the top of my list. First listen the lead singer's voice does sound a lot like Creed but after repeated listens his voice grows on you and actually sounds warmer and far more emotional than anything Creed has ever done. Out of what I've heard Missing You is by far my favorite. The only thing as far as I know that I would change would be to throw on an acoustic song or something that leans more toward a ballad instead of an anthem. But still this is a totally great cd!"
1,Recycled,"This is a very very dissapointing first release by Big Dismal. This Cd sounds like everysingle other band on Wind up Records(creed,12 stones) There isn't a single bit of originality in this whole album. This band will quickly be collecting dust on many music shelves."
5,Believe,This C.D. is awsome. I would recomened it to anyone who likes rock a little bit to a lot. From the Hard rock Remember to the upbeat Missing you this cd is awsome everyone should have it
5,music lover,I just got this a week ago. I cant stop listening to this little ep. I absolutely love it. I cant wait for the full album. The song phantom limb is unreal. These guys make some of the most unique cool music out their.
2,Melting Pot,"I found this to be a tough read and somewhat boring. I bought this book due to an interest in this time period and it does give facts about research in this period but is not really a history per say. The lack of material regarding colonial United States was surprising to me. Most history books deal with the initial founding of an area and then jump to the Revolutionary War. If you are looking more for a developing history rather than facts I would recommend Russell Shorto's, Island at the Center of the World, but that only takes you to the beginning of the 18th Century. Finding material from 1700-1770 is are rare unexplored nitch in time. You will find the Anglicanization of the America's interesting and it's clash with the Dutch culture that originally settled this area."
4,"This really is ""So Easy!""","This product really is super easy to figure out! It helped me learn how to make wonderfully healthy food for my growing baby. I highly reccommend this product, the only thing I can say somewhat against it, is that I wish it came with a couple of more food trays and lids. You can easily buy more online though! Great product!"
3,Not used yet,I bought this to use on my next baby so I haven't used it yet to give a very good review. I opened it up and it looks like if you just use an ice tray and a baby food cookbook it's the same thing as this offers
5,Educational,Received timely. It is for my grandson for Christmas. We have not watched it yet but he has other Einstein CD's and we love them.I am sure we will love this one also.Thank you.
5,great video,"My son is almost 2 and he loves this video! it's the only thing that gets him to sit still, and he tries to repeat the words they say, which helps him learn to talk."
5,"Goes further than car, boat and plane...",It definetly introduces to A LOT transport means.... some I didnt even know!!!Great music and varied images... my 2yr old loved it!
2,Disappointing,"Once Baby Einstein/Julie Clark and crew sold out to Disney the quality of the movies went down hill. There is way too much animation and less reality in the movies now, with this one being no exception. The first 10 Baby Einstein videos are the best featuring real toys, puppets, kids and animals--without the cartoons and effects that many baby and child videos contain---THAT IS WHAT MADE THEM SO GOOD IN THE BEGINNING. Sell out to the big companies and see what happens to quality--happens with everything these days...."
3,Not as entertainng as the other Baby Einstein's at all...,"I thought my son would love this one since he loves cars, planes, and trains. But they made this one way too long and he gets bored after about 10 minutes. Now if I put on any other Baby Einstein that we own he is mesmerized for the 25-30 min. it is on. This one is longer than 40 min and is missing the winning formula of the other Baby Einstein's. Hopefully this is not a new trend since the others are all awesome in my book."
3,Better for children under two,"This is a very good DVD, but better suited for a child under 2. I bought it for my son on his second birthday. He likes to watch it, but after the first time, he was able to say and recognize all the shapes. He still watches it, but I don't think he's getting too much out of it anymore. I think it would have been better if I purchased in when he was 18 months old."
5,Great video!,"Just like all the Baby Einstein videos, my kids love it. They don't even know they're learning anything because it's so entertaining."
1,Picture makes luggage look much bigger than it is,"This bag is not worth the money. It is such a small bag, that the minute I opened the box it was delived in,I was disappointed and didn't even open the plastic wrapper. I am not sure what you could pack in it....maybe it should be called a backpack, but not luggage!~"
4,"good paper, hard to find frames","I was pleased with the quality of this paper. I did find it strange that it was awfully difficult to find frames that were a size 13x19, so don't just assume that because Epson sells the paper in that size that there are lots of frame choices. I went to at least 3-4 major retailers before I finally found a frame in this size."
5,great sound for a band,i saw this band on sabrina the teenage witch..i never heard of them before but i really like the sound of their music so i will definately be buying their cd sometime in the near future...
4,"This introduced me to 10,000 Maniacs, and rather late","I bought this on a whim eons ago at the almighty Tower Records without ever hearing of them or their music, and put it on and immediately was blown away. Rare for me to find an album that does that to me. I was a fan for the rest of Natalie Merchant's run with the band and continue to follow her career."
4,"Get this CD just for ""verdi cries""","Verdi Cries is my favorite song of all time. It's worth the entire CD, which is pretty good if a little granola at times, just to get that song."
2,Very disappointed,"The track listing provided in the information on your Amazon page lists Peace Train as track 7 on this edition of the album. However, it is not on the album I received. Frankly, I would not have ordered this product for this price if the description correctly omitted that track."
3,"Great, but missing ""Peace Train""","A great album that was severely damaged in 1989 when the band removed ""Peace Train"" from the middle of the album. The song sat perfectly between ""Don't Talk"" and ""Gun Shy"". What I don't understand is that the song is still available in the international versions. Picked up a copy of the CD in London a couple of years ago just to get the ""Peace Train"" version. Seek that version out over this one. This album becomes a 4-star rating for me with that song back."
4,Solid Folk Rock Album,"In addition to being the band that launched Natalie Merchant's career, 10,000 Maniacs were among the best of the late 1980s college rock groups that gained popularity in the wake of R.E.M.'s success. ""In My Tribe"" was the Merchant and Company's best album, containing the ace single ""Like the Weather,"" and accompanying material that is just as strong. Other highlights are the child abuse take ""What's the Matter Here,"" the tribute ""Hey Jack Kerouac,"" and the catchy ""Don't Talk."" Unfortunately, the band pulled their wonderful cover version of Cat Stevens's ""Peace Train"" off of subsequent pressings of this album after Stevens's coversion to radical Islam and his support of Ayatolah Khomeni's call for Muslims to kill author Salmon Rushdie for publishing ""The Satanic Verses."" While I support the band's thinking, it robs the album of one of its best performances.Overall, an excellent record that sounds as fresh today as when it was released in 1987."
5,Stunning and beautiful vocals,"When I originally bought this (at least 10-years ago) I was floored by ""What's the matter here"" I WAS that little boy. Back in the 60's that was just the way it was. I was the one that was black and blue and bruised all the time, hiding under the bed, running out side to get away from a Father that had major issues. To this day it is hard for me to listen to the song, but it also means very much to me. In some way's it brought closure, and in some ways it brought feelings and memories out that were and are deeply hidden. Natalie Merchant's vocals bring the emotion out in this and all her music. Verdi Cries, Like the weather and Don't talk are my other favorites on this CD. To me, this was a very powerful CD and Natalie Merchant's vocals are simply beautiful!"
4,Controversy is a shame,"This is a great album, and even better if you can find a copy with `Peace Train' on it. Its a shame that the media distorted Yusef Islam's (Cat Stevens) statements to make it appear that he supported killing Salman Rushdie..."
1,wont work,Opened up and tried this supposedly new cd for the first time in my lab top and on two cd players and it would not play any music. The cd just spun around and got all scratched up.
4,probably in the top 20 best college albums of the 80's,"In My Tribe is a great album. Natalie Merchant & Co. were very influential to the 90's Lilith Far acts that broke into the mainstream. ""Verdi Cries"" is wonderfully beautiful (Worth buying just for that one song). This album has all the ingredient's of a great album but looses a star for it's unevenness. There's about 5 or 6 standout tracks and the others are easy to forget. This album also looses points for it's 80's production values that has not held up well (Too much Reverb on the drums). One aspect of the album that has aged well is the lyrics. Merchant takes on issues that are still important today(Not that thats hard to do; we've been dealing with generally the same issues since the beginning of time). ""They're so good at making soldiers, but they're not as good at making men""; is one of the better lines. Although this album might not hold up as well as U2's ""War"" or R.E.M.'s ""Murmur"" it's still among the great albums of the 80's."
4,Very Haunting but....,"This album is very haunting but well worth listening to. Songs in particular tells stories about child abuse(""What's the Matter Here?"") and what is being kind of being done about it and a life of a famous writer who died young(""Hey Jack Kerouac"").All the other songs are just as good, if not, rather worth listening to as well. Highly Recommended!"
1,I can't believe how bad this is..,"Aside from the fact that it's a cheap piece of garbage (I had to bend it back into shape upon receiving it, and it's too light to keep itself in place when you pull a towel off.), it's also got a little bolt sticking out of the bottom that extends beyond the little rubber feet and scratches any surface you use it on. Wha...???"
2,Light Duty Knife,"This is a very light duty knife and the blade will come out if used for anything other than cutting open boxes. I picked up a couple for less than five bucks apiece, but I still don't think it was worth it. Spend a little extra on a better knife. It will be a lot safer and less frustrating!"
3,Decent and affordable,"Overall the knife is a decent product. It's durable and light weight.The biggest problem is the quick change. It's easy to use, but it doesn't hold the blade very securely. Sometimes if the blade hangs up on something it pulls right out of the knife.I recommend it for light use (opening boxes) and not for heavy duty use (cutting cardboard)."
2,Doesn't hold a blade,This knife is cool looking and slim and can be opened comfortably with one hand. For about 3 days of moderate use it was great but then I tried to cut a few layers of corrugated with it and the blade popped out of the knife and remained stuck in the cardboard. After that if just wouldn't hold a blade anymore. I think it was a reasonable task to ask of a utility knife so unless mine was defective the quick change system isn't adequate.
3,Good for light work,"Good for light work, but if you apply too much pressure, the blade pops out. This could be very dangerous!Recommended only for opening packages, and VERY light duty work, for which it is perfect."
2,dangerous,"I've carried a cheap locking blade razor knife for 2 years. I got this one as a present and I loved it!But, after using it for 2 months I've had several close calls (cutting myself) while using it.I've used it for cutting those heavy duty plastic straps that bind our paper orders and I use to use it to cut down the cardboard afterwards...DO NOT USE FOR CUTTING CARDBOARD!The pressure used to push the blade into the cardboard is more than enough to release the spring loaded stud that you use to load and unload your razor blades. So the blade comes right out. Either slightly out of the blade, sticking in to the cardboard box, or falling out completely.So... be careful. The easy load stud was a great idea... just wish they could make it safer. I don't recommend this product."
4,One of the coolest dance music albums ever!,"Wow! Ok, here's the deal, I'm a Disney nut (so I suppose that makes this a pretty heavily biased review) but I also love great dance music and this album is really cool! If you like dance/techno style music you will love these interpretations of Disney music... even if you're not a big fan of Disney music! This a great CD, a lot of fun, and a worthy spend!"
4,Arrived mint condition,and in time for birthday gift.Approximate arrival time stated by Amazon is pretty accurate.Pleased with entire process
3,Not as good as....,"I purchased ""Country Crossroads"" and was so pleased with Steve's interpretation of country classics that I thought ""On the Country Side"" would be a great continuation of his music. I was dissappointed. I was probably more dissappointed in the music selections than Steve's artistry but it just didn't have the happiness and vitality of ""Country Crossroads"". I'll keep looking."
2,"good performance, horrible sound","Sammy and his band still have all the energy they've always had live, but the sound on this cd could have been a lot better. When I turn the volume up for the live sound, I can't hear the drums, the guitars sound weak, and overall it sounds like it was recorded at a large stadium instead of a smaller club. Yes, it has that true live sound and it sounds like you're actually there, but it sounds like the concert you go to once in a while that sounds like s**t.The song selection is a good mix of his best solo stuff and some Hagar-era VH stuff, like Dreams, Why Can't This Be Love, Right Now, and some others.This cd is for the die-hard collectors only. If you want decent sound, you'll be disappointed."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"This cd is mostly a re-hash of Van Halen songs. It seems that Sammy is trying to prove that he can still do it without Van Halen. He does an OK job, but why should I pay for this CD when I already have most of the songs (done better) by Sammy with Van Halen?"
2,Sammy Sucks without Van Halen,It is very depressing to here the Van Halen songs not being played by Van Halen.Sammy and Van Halen need to realize they need each other.
4,The VH songs sound like you're listening to VH,"Hearing Sammy's voice and Michael Anthony's backing vocals on the Van Halen songs, you can almost think that you're listening to VH. Sammy's guitar player does an excellent job of covering Eddie."
3,"Great music, poor mix","There's some great music on this DVD-A. But the mix is inconsistant. Some songs are great surround mixes. Some are OK and some are just awful. I found myself constant tweaking the audio to get the kind of quality I'm used to with DVD-A, as the mix quality actually varies from song to song. It's a shame because the performance itself it great - but the sound engineer should be flogged."
5,Great,This candy is great and the service was really fast and good. I would recommend this to other people. I also tell my friends about this candy thats how good it is.
5,Deliciousness,"What more can I say, you know what this is. ;)Strawberry is the best flavor of them all.I find this to be my favorite candy. My problem is I don't know when to stop until they are all gone!"
5,excellent and long-lasting!,"I love this stuff! Most lip balms give temporary relief but leave your lips ""addicted"" to more and more applications to feel pliable. I feel like this stuff really penetrates and keeps my lips moisturized, even when it's long gone from the surface."
3,Not as good as other Desert Essence Prodcuts,"This lip balm is very ""dry."" Its very thick and does coat your lips well, but its not very comfortable to put on. I know this sounds strange but I'll try to explain. When you put other lip balms on (like burt's bees for example) they slide onto your lips and make your lips feel sort of slippery. With this lip balm, it doesn't slide on because it doesn't have much moisture to it. Still useable, just not nearly as great as other desert essence products I've used. (The Coconut shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are great!)"
2,unfortunately not for me,"Maybe it's an allergy but my lips feel slightly itchy when I put it on. I prefer softlips by far, they make me feel that satisfying hydrated feeling. This one is slightly more sticky-feeling. Would not buy again."
3,Useful but Disappointing,"Brieg Points is a good place to start if you don't find the parents web sites for USNA. If you find and read the various parents guides, you get much of the same information without buying a book and much more up to date. However, if you want to find this info in one place in an easy to read format, this is a good place to be. The mid-speak section, almost half the book, is a useful reference to have handy when your mid comes home to visit. However, there are so many midspeak terms missing it still leaves you wanting (so, where is the entry for ""pogey bait"" or the acronym ARMY). Given its brevity, missing information and lack of photos of many of the things it speaks of, I can only give this book 3 stars."
4,Wish I had read it sooner.,Wish I had read this book before I dropped my son off on Induction Day for Plebe Summer. It contains a lot of usefull information. I only gave the book 4 stars because I felt it could have been a little more up to date but I would buy it again.
2,It leaves my hair too dry.,"After 20 years of dying my hair (w reg. hair dye) monthly, I switched to something less toxic for my hair. I have black hair, so I know I wouldn't be blonde, but I was hoping to get a diff. color. It is dark brown now -not even honey like color. It covered 40% of my gray hairs (I only have few). After I used the product, my hair was SOOOOOO dry and w/o shine. I have to use oil now for my hair to look healthy.I wouldn't buy this brand anymore. I am going to try a diff natural brand to see if it works for me."
4,Excellent book,This book ties present day locations with history so well. Excellent and still a classic Chattanooga/Nashville reference for the Civil War.
4,Perfect for beginners,"If you're not it's still great because it forces you to concentrate on your body during the movements. It also gives a lot of great advice. These moves are core moves only. If your looking for more, this video is not for you. My favorite part was actually during the credits you are able to view the instructor in action during several clips."
1,toooo simple,"I suppose this DVD would be good if you are an extremely repressed housewife, but otherwise, skip it! They should spend less time telling people its okay to act sexy and more time showing interesting moves. If you want to learn to dance sexy, I recommend any of Neena and Veena's belly dancing tapes. You'll learn more from 5 minutes there than from this entire hour-long tape."
1,dissatisfied,"I would expecting something new and different. Everyone could use a little spice and sensualness in their life. What I got was moving your hips around in a circle... and that's all. Don't waste your money, folks."
1,This video was pretty lame,I was super excited to get this tape i thought it would give exciting sexy moves to do for my boyfriend taught by a real stripper but this was more about women getting in touch with their sexuality which is wonderful except i was expecting more of an insturctional video. I pretty much have done every move in this video by myself in front of my mirror prior to using this video. Dont get it unless you are very intimitated by the idea of stripping and dont feel very comfortable in your body.
3,nice video not well recorded,"I did receive this video on time, however I did not like the video the way it was done was poor and why did they have to ad those two women that messed the video up they had no dancing abilities."
3,Feelin Sexy,"This video was very helpful in making me more confident in feeling good about myself and feeling sexy. You learn a few moves and then at the end put it all together. However the only downfall is the video is 23 mins long and not enough moves and information in there. I do recomend this for someone who wants to learn how to turn your significant other on in a new way, a way sure to make him happy to hand you the credit card to order this video before Friday night rolls around, lol :-) Good Luck :-)"
2,Still Looking to Learn,"If you just want to ""feel good"" about yourself or if you need help ""liking"" your body, then this video is for you. However, if you're looking for an informative resource to actually learn how to dance exotically this is NOT the place. I must say, after reading the previous reviews I was eager to recieve my video, but it didn't take long for my excitement to dissipate once it arrived and I hit 'play'. I already like myself. I wanted to learn how to dance sensuously for my partner! This video focused too much on the ""every day participants"" in the class and not enough on the instructor. She definitely should have done a ""solo"" instructional video!"
5,This is the sad truth,"Though this biography was downplayed by the band in Song Stories, I believe it has more journalistic substance. Chris Twomey actually got to know the memebers, and was ballsy enough to be critical in his appraisal. He obviously touched a nerve, or there would be no need for Song Stories! Read it and realize they're people too,each with their own vision of what should have been."
4,CARLY'S STILL IN GOOD SHAPE,"I'm a Carly simon fan for a long time and i have most of their records, so, i couldn't let this opportunity escape.She's still in a good shape, the beautiful voice is still there.It's a jazzy kind of concert mixed with the old themes that we all know e love.The place is fantastic and the audience unusal, although is a very intimist concert.It has also an acoustic set (with her daughter Sally) wich i particullary love.The DVD sound and image is great - 5 stars.Buy it. Your collection of Music DVDs will be richer."
3,It's been a long time,"I think the last time I saw Carly was on a SNL season 1 dvd, so... I was sort of expecting her lilting young Carly voice singing in that rich tone she had in her early career. What this DVD exposed (to me anyway), was an aged voice about an octave lower than I was used to. A little rough and worn. But it was okay. It was me who wasn't used to it. She used to perform barefoot and from what I could tell, she still does. Enjoy."
3,Big Band Extravaganza,"There are good things about this DVD - Carly sounds good, the venue is attractive, the video is good. However, a couple of things really weigh it down for me. First, there are not a lot of Carly Simon songs here. Most of the songs are covers. Second, all the songs, even Carly Simon's, are cast into more of a big band style. This is not intrinsically bad, just not what I was expecting or prefer."
5,Carly Simon and the oldies,I love this Music DVD. It is great if you want to relax for an hour or more and it is fun to see Carly Simon enjoying the Cruise. I am giving this DVD as gifts to friends I like it so much.
2,Not good,"If you want to see the Carly Simon of the cds , this is not the one, her voice is not good , to be honest painfull."
5,"Moonlight ""Superb"" Serenade","Carly Simon is like a vintage bottle of fine wine... She improves with age. The venue for this DVD "" The Queen Mary 2"" was a perfect setting. It allowed Carly to be herself and at the same time present a new and vigorous Carly Simon. The Arrangements were excellent and the musicans couldn't have been better.Every note... every word of every lyric was right on key and was a disticnt achievment any vocalist would be proud of. Ms' Simon reached out and touched the hearts of everyone in the magnificent ballroom. .... and it came through on the DVD as well.Carly Simon is a PRO in every sense of the word and this DVD is a major accomplishment. It will bring a whole new genre to further understand and enjoy what true music is.Stay well Carly..... we want more of the same from you... for a long time.Joe FolinoTurlock, CA"
5,Carly at her best,"I just received this DVD from Amazon. This is Carly at her best. She put her heart and soul into this performance. Yes, her voice does at times go away, but she is not used to peforming in front of people. She was even scared that her voice would leave her an admitted it at the beginning of the DVD. Since 1980, Carly has released many good albums and has not achieved commercial success. Certainly she deserves it. This performance on the QM2 was a one-time event that only Carly could do. Lets see how many artists copy her like they have. She was the first singer to record standards and then everybody copied her. Lets give Carly Simon the great she deserves. In addition to being a great artist, she appears to be a great person too."
5,Awesome,I absolutely love the DVD! Carly is awesome! I love the acoustic set. I feel very fortunate to have a piece of history! Carly is one of the best singers still out there. I'm a 19 year old fan of hers. I first started listening to her when I was in diapers. To see her on this DVD just makes it so much better!
2,Was hoping for more.,I was hoping for her more of her previous hits. It was a lot of songs that I'm not familiar with. Her concert from Grand Central Station was a lot better.
2,"CarlyNeverLookedBetter,but the voice is Flatter than a pancake","I couldn't listen to this DVD anymore.I got to song 14,""Noboody does it better,"" and my ears were hurting SO BAD.My eyes felt great looking at this BEUTIFULL,SEXY artist.ITs unreal Carlys 60,but once she starts singing you will know that.I've been a Carly Simon fan since 1978,and will be for the rest of my life,but I would have NEVER let this DVD be released if I was her.It was like picking a stranger from the croud and having her sing.I've seen Carly live in 1980 when she had her well know breakdown on stage,and that concert was alot better than this one on the Queen Mary 2.If I was at this show,I would have jumped overboard."
4,Make It or Break It: Volume One Extended Edition,An enjoyable new series in to the world of competitive gymnatics. Looking forward to when Volume Two is available.
5,Love it,It was exactly as described and it arrived a lot quicker than I expected. I would definitley recommened this series.
3,"Fun, but dated","Being of the old school in literary theory, I believe that books should address issues that are relevant at all times. This does not. Frankly, I haven't heard about Pat since I read this book, and he certainly doesn't seem to be big in politics any more. Even if he were, a single election or two aren't great themes. On the other hand, while showing the often amusing foibles of Pat's life and weltanschauung, Robbins does hit many of the major themes of philosophical inquiry, particularly relating to those relevant to the Reformed perspective. However, if one wants to read about the Reformed perspective, _Religion, Reason, and Revelation_, by Gordon H. Clark would be a better volume."
5,What a blessing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This dvd has an awesome anointing on it!! I was extremely blessed by her words, singing and energy. Pressed down, shaken together and overflowing!!!!!!!! That's what I'm talking about!"
3,Wakeman in a more relaxed mood,"Fans of Wakeman's ""Yes"" era who discover this album without trying any of his other solo work may be disappointed. It's not the high-energy Wakeman one would expect. It's much more laid back and ""new age"" sounding than ""Six Wives"" or ""Journey"". It's closer in feel to ""Myths and Legends"", although the narration, provided by the same narrator as on ""Journey"", evokes memories of his better works. The basic story is, he wrote these tracks to evoke images of the seven wonders of the world, only one of which still remains. And that's part of the problem. I believe one of the better tracks is the ""Great Pyramid"" sequence, which might have been influenced by pictures of the Pyramids. Other ""wonders"" aren't as evocative of their names, probably because they no longer exist. Don't pick this up as your first exposure to solo Wakeman, but his fans will love it."
5,HIstoricaly Hypnotic,"If you are intriguiged by the incredible efforts of our forborours then this is your work. Rick Wakeman has researched these great works and focused on what they have meant to the people at the time, from the Great Light House to the Temple of Zeus. I am very impressed at how his voice are followed by the music.This is an example of Rick Wakeman's more human musical track. If you want to travel in time and visualize what these ancient marvels meant to their people, you should hear this."
4,In the top tier of Wakeman's solo work,"Seven Wonders follows a similar recipe as his other best known solo instrumental albums. The music does take you on a visual mind journey like the best of his work. It is well worth repeat listening. If you like Six Wives of Henry the Eighth, you will like this dic."
2,Heaven forbid yours should ever need repair,Mine did. When I could get Customer Service on the phone they couldn't find the unit. I have had to have it repaired three times in 6 months. Panasonic has been of almost no help until I brought my attorney into it.
5,POWER BUY,"THIS DIGITAL CAMCORDER, FOR THE PRICE, IS BY FAR THE BEST UNIT IN THE IDUSTRY. IF YOU ARE A VIDEO FILE LIKE MYSELF, YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY THE PV-DV851. LOOK AROUND AT THE 899.99 PRICE RANGE AND NOTHING COMPARES."
3,Basic Personality Information,"If you are already familiar with the Myers Briggs personality types, this book may be a bit simple. I found it lacked the depth I was hoping for. For example, the book did not compare the different personality types to each other. Instead, the book talks about the individual personality types in a work environment, almost as a way to get to know oneself better. While I agree with knowing oneself better is important, so is knowing others better. One issue in a work environment, in my opinion, that often bring conflict and difficulty are personalities clashing. The book would have been better if they discussed how to enhance work relationships between the types.Skip the book if you want more than the basics of personality type."
5,Must have gadget,"I saw a similar item on an info commercial and bought it at a local store. It was garbage. Bought the real deal, this one, and have been using it for at least 2 years and it is the most used item in the kitchen. I recently purchased another because my first one is always in the wash."
5,stainless tongs,"this works well for cooking. I greatly prefer tongsthat close flat like these, as opposed to the ones thatcurve leaving a gap. It is very difficult to find flat tongs, especially in stainless,"
5,A Must Have For Any Cook,"This is a perfect strong quality product that I wouldn't be without. I don't think a day goes by that I don't use this size or the larger size. I purchased the larger size after having this size for about a year. Great for wisking, serving, turning foods while cooking. Just can't say enough about it. I love these tongs and would be lost without them."
4,A must-read for understanding present day Italy,"An excellent book to understand many important events in recent Italian history. A good antidote against many oversimplifications and false commonplaces about Italian politics and society. THe book is more journalistic than scholarly, and sometimes presents less evidence for its claims that it should. But the evidence exists elsewhere, so all the main arguments of the book are sound. It urgently deserves and Italian translation."
1,one star...The book is well writen.,"Luca Mantovani is a public-relations-man of the Italian Party ""Forza Italia"", allied with the ex-fascist ""Alleanza Nazionale"". The Forza Italia's leader Silvio Berlusconi was very very close to the Socialist Party ex-leader Bettino Craxi, who was one of the most corrupted politician in Italy. It seems that Craxi gave many many favours to Berlusconi, who seems to have something to hide about these favours and his own past. It's true, it's possible that there was somebody behind the judges in the Operation ""Clear Hands"", maybe the ex-Communist Party ""PDS"". But the point is that I don't accept any judgement from Mantovani, extremely involved in this dramatic and confused situation, in which his own party is more interested to fight what they call ""the judge party"" and to save their leader, than to think about the real needs of Italian People."
3,FYI,"I just wanted to mention this to B.Movie fans... there is a track on The Faint's new album Wet From Birth that has borrowed a melody (with permission) from ""Remembrance Days."" I suggest checking that out!"
2,Great Looking Watch - Terrible Time Piece,"This watch looks awesome. Out of the box, it gains 15 seconds an hour, or 6 minutes a day.. Invicta quality control dropped the ball on this one. Looks great, functionly inept."
5,Very Nice,"Well built watch the money, I can't believe how Invicta can make such a well made watch and keep the cost down so much this is my second Invicta Watch and will buy more."
2,Buy a sundial !,"This thing is worthless , looks good, but calendar function is broke ,, runs BOTH fast and slow!! How can a company that wants to stay in business make such crap!!??"
2,beautiful watch....,"unfortunately you need to buy a winder with this watch. Otherwise the watch stops unexpectedly when you least expect it. This watch must have very cheapautomatic mechanism, it doesn't stay wound for long and goes dead on you often. It's a very nice watch (Submariner copy)especially the color of the dial and the bezel. Should the watch stay wound reasonable time, I'd buy it again."
2,Don't expect too much,"I bought this watch in 2008 and it worked fine for about one year. The bezel fell off in water one day but I was able to retrieve it and put it back on. Over the course of another year, the bezel fell off several times. It finally fell off without my knowledge and I lost it. You have to wear the watch 24 hours a day or it will stop running. The self winding would not carry it through 7 hours while sitting on the night stand. After about a year and a half, the watch began to gain time. After losing the bezel, I gave up and bought a Citizen watch that is much better quality."
2,Unhappy,This item doesn't word properly and it's not water resistant. I have send it back for return. sorry. It look very nice but I was so disappointed.
1,Sorry!!!!,"Watch did not function properly upon arrival, choose another INVICTA Pro diver watch before this one.J"
1,Don't buy this watch,"This is a very nice looking watch, it is too bad that it doesn't work. I guess I now know why it seemed to be such a good deal when I got it. If I was sitting on a large quanity of them I would let them go for nothing. No sense in making good costomers not want to buy anything else from you. This review is for Amazon as well as the rest of us."
3,looked beautiful in the pictures,"I got this watch & I am not sure why I found it in that color. It looked beautiful in the pictures, although the pictures do a good job illustrating it. Time stays accurate and the watch appears to be all that the manufacturer claims it to be."
2,A good $20 NYC street fake Rolex kind of watch,"Band is cheap, screams poor quality, ""automatic"" movement lasts less than 12 hours. You get what you pay for. Get a real watch."
2,Disappointed,"Whilst the product arrived in a very timely manner and packaging was impeccable and the watch kept excellent accuracy, this was counteacted by the watch stopping most nights neccessitating the time to be reset nearly every morning."
1,poor,"I liked the way it had a very high quality finish. But It was defective right out of the box .I was so disapointed in the way it started to gain time every hour. 2 hours in about 12 or so hours. Then I heard from other people on the invicta site about the poor quality internal workings .A friend of mine payed much more for his and He said ,""I would have been better off buying a 20 dollar Rolex knock-off at the swap meet"""
1,while you are sleeping!,"It may look good but the perpetual winding lasts about 8 hours. You have to change the time every morning,since while you are sleeping the watch dies! would not recommend!"
2,Watch looks fine but date can not be adjusted. Help!,"Watch looks fine but date can not be adjusted. Help! Can't adjust the date, what can I do, also your link amazonservice@invictawatch.com doesn't lead to any assistance. What's going on?"
1,looks deceive,Beautiful watch...brand newA gift for my husband...straight out of the box..The stem will not move..its jammedUnable to set the watch.It takes 2-3 months to get it fixed or replaced via invicta...No mos for me.
2,sent back,The watch looks sharp. The gold on the band is only on the top of the link. I think it will wear off fast. I set the watch at noon time. In 3 hrs. it was 15 min. fast. Packed the watch and sent it back. I have a seiko skx009 for 6 years and it is only off by 5 sec. a day. I just wish the seiko looked as nice as this watch. I will be looking for a deal on a seiko skx007.
4,Classic looking timpiece... but will it last?,"My last Invicta SS 21 jewel Miyota diver automatic lasted 9 years of abuse in a power plant. It was banged on, pulled at and bent, yet always worked fine with absolutely no maintenance, except for the jeweler straightening out the band. This year the date adjust stopped working and it couldn't keep time, so I bought this beautiful gold plated two tone diver, for half the price of my last Invicta.Visually all the markings are the same, and the fit and finish look terrific. Much better looking than the photo. And it appears that this new Invicta will run longer without wearing it.Have no experience with the gold plating toughness... but what the heck, for the price of a Rolex overhaul I could just buy another Invicta!"
3,Invicta Men's Pro Diver Two-Tone Automatic Watch,The watch is beautiful. It looks LIKE my REAL Rolex which was stolen from me a while back and is being held as evidence. However the Invicta LOSES FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR PER DAY??? So I plan to stop using it. Who wants a watch that's always slow an hour or so???
1,customer,"This watch did not work from the moment I received it. I have owned automatic watches before, so I know how they should work, and this one does not. The date could not be set except by winding through the hours. The hands would not continue to move even after I followed the specified activation and winding instructions. The watch looks good, and I would have kept it if it had worked. As to the water-proofness and long-term reliability, I guess I'll never know. So far, the Amazon return process seems good, and I am hopeful of receiving a full and prompt refund."
4,Really Happy with purchase,Good quality watch. Nice weight to it and feels fairly solid. Have the watch a few weeks now and no problems so far. Not as classy looking as rolex sub but no where near as expensive either. Would recommend.
1,"Nice looking, doesnt keep time.....","The watch looks nice, but it doesnt keep time. When i set it down it stops moving and i have to manually adjust the time every time i want to wear it. It is a piece of junk and doesnt do its job."
2,Despite gorgeous look WARNING : SHOULD YOU EVER NEED EVEN A LITTLE PART REPLACED,I just got off the phone with one of your customer service represenatives . I had to order the endpiece to a watch band (the end piece that is closest to the watch itself. ) 5 dollars for that itty bitty piece but hey it is what it is but THEN came the news that really annoyed me. It can take 90 days for you to receive this!! Are you serious 90 days.. ok how bout if I order a whole brand new band? Nope still 90 days! She goes on to tell me that watch or screw or band it doesnt matter it can take a full 90 days. Im thinking Im not speaking to INVICTA but sure enough this is INVICTA. We dont keep stock here she said we order it from switzerland. Needless to say I am horribly dissappointed. I have ordered 2 Invicta watches in the pst but certainly dont want to do that again. It is ridiculous that something as siple as a screw or endpiece or even a whole band takes 3 months to get. Outrageous! Sorely dissapointed over here!
1,A true disappointment,"I had really looked forward to getting this watch and really regreted it when I did.I have another Pro diver (an 8932). It works well. This one didn't. The unidirectional dial was EXTREMELY difficult to move. My current model is an exceptionally accurate timepiece. This model was exceptional in that it lost so much time every day; about 7 minutes (+/-). I'm not saying that isn't an anomoly for the watch but, after being so disappointed, I didn't want to take the chance on another one...... However, it IS A GOOD LOOKING WATCH. Own it a day or two before resizing. If you resize it, it can't be returned! My advice, choose a different model.... or buy a good, dependable Timex."
1,crappy,"Crappy gold plate rubs off after a day or two on the band. The band broke after 4 months of use. Not worth it, buy a fossil."
5,Great watch,"This is the second one of these watches I've bought my first one I had for 3 years till it was stolen. My fault I left it in my car. I loved it so much, I wanted to replace it with the same watch. I could have chosen a different watch but this model is GREAT, I get a lot of complements on it. Thank you Invicta... if I loose this one I'll buy another one if they are still in production..."
5,Exceeded Expectations!!!!,"My dad has a Rolex submariner that I love, so I was looking to get one myself until I found this gem. What did I have to loose? For only $85 shipped, I figured if it looked or felt cheap I'd chalk it up as a loss and get the real deal. Well no need to get the real deal. Color and size are exactly the same. Since the watch is all stainless steel, it has some good weight to it as well. The movement is nice and smooth, just like the $9,500 Rolex. I've read a couple of reviews saying that the gold plating looked orange, this watch doesn't have that problem I was able to put it side by side to the Rolex and it is spot on!"
4,"Nice watch, decent quality","I'm used to wearing Tag Heuer watches. Tough, elegant, well worth the money. I ordered this watch to try out to see how I liked it, along with ordering my wife a SS/gold Invicta. I liked hers alot better. Hers is a Swiss movement, this is a Japanese movement.This watch is beautiful, but I still returned it for a refund. The ONLY reason I returned it is due to the bracelet being of relatively light stainless steel. Guess I'm used to the quality of Tag Heuer. This watch is a really good buy, but the bracelet fails to sway me to this brand. I'm tough on watches and I'm not sure this bracelet would hold up to my standards (Tag does for sure), hence my rating of only 4 stars."
5,"nice watch, very classy","the first watch they sent was the wrong one, they quickly sent the right one and I couldnt be happier. Love the automatic movement, Ive had manycompliments. you cant go wrong with a classy watch like this"
4,"Close, but not close enough","Bought this recently as a kind of sort of Rolex knock off. Weight is a little light, but not too bad. Solid watches may you feel fake rich. Nothing really bad about the watch, but nothing really good, either. And it would have been so easy to add a bit of weight.Setting the date should have been a one button affair.But , no, you have to pull the stem all the way out and this exposes the watches' main problem. A thin layer of what my dad would have called ""Old Pot Metal"" weak where it should have been strong. Grinding where it should have been smooth( check the bezel) accurate where it could have been precise. All of this aside, the watch does have the look (if not the feel) of a more expensive timepiece."
2,its a show,"the watch looks nice but is cheap because of its price. there's a reason why they copied rolexs look, your basically buying a fake rolex."
5,Beautiful watch. Looks just like the Rolex Submariner.,"Upon opening the box this watch looks amazing. The blue dial is very nice with the color changing to a blueish purple depending on the light. The band looks very nice and is of good quality. The Bezel numbers look just like the one in the submariner. Mine came with the Seiko NH35A movement which is of excellent quality and has the hacking mode. If I dont wear the watch for 2 days, it stops, but thats fine because all you have to do is set the time and date and move the watch and it starts. You can also manualy wind it by unscrewing the crown and turning it clockwise. I have other more expensive watches than the invicta 8928ob but I find myself wearing this one more than the others. A lady at church already asked me if it was a real Rolex. There will be a time when God will give me one. In the meantime, I really like this one and believe that will have many years of use."
3,Invicta Men's 8928OB Pro,Wrong model and year. I ordered a 2006 8928OB 24 Kt gold plated watch. I was delivered a 2011 Gold tone 8928 that was not an OB.Why can't I ask some one to contact me about this issue?
2,Very poor repair service,Wife bought me this watch for Christmas 2011. It's my 2nd Invicta. I love the feel & Looks of the watch. I only wore this watch a dozen times never to work or around water. Just 5 months later in May 2012 the watch got moisture in it. Sent it back to Invicta by priority mail ($5.00) for repair under warranty with a check for $27.00 to cover shipping it back. On June 17th called to see when watch would be repaired & sent back was told that it was scheduled to be repaired by SEP 20th. Today is Oct 10th called & was told that the watch was sent oversees for repair & won't be back for 2 more weeks.Send the watch oversees to repair it and it takes 5 months???? This is my last Invicta !!!Invicta Men's 8928OB Pro Diver Two-Tone Automatic Watch
4,Decent Watch,"The watch looks pretty good and has kept very good time for the first week, seldom needing any adjustment. The band is adequate although I found it a little hard to remove the necessary links for sizing. All in all, well worth the price on Amazon. This watch replaces a battery operated Invicta watch that constantly went through batteries in less than a year. The self winding feature works fine for my husband as he wears the watch constantly."
5,Great and attractive watch,"I bought this watch for my father in law this past christmas. It looks great on the wrist and he loves it. even with not wearing it for a day it still keeps time. He especially enjoyed the jeweler where he took it to be sized telling him it was the nicest watch he had seen come in in a month. Some may complain about Invicta on here, but I have bought 4 of them, including gifts to others, all of them flawless...Invicta is the working mans Rolex and allows those of us on a tight budget to still enjoy collecting nice watches."
5,Very Satisfied,I placed my order and received my watch in a very timely manner. All was perfect with packaging and contents. My wife has had the womens version for several years and has been very satisfied with hers. I was not prepared to drop the coin involved in purchasing the Rolex Submariner at this time so this was a very nice looking inexpensive substitute until I'm prepared to part with the money involved with the Rolex. Watch has kept perfect time with only one adjustment needed in the two months I have owned it. I am very happy with my purchase at this time. We will see how the watch fares over the next year.
1,Problems with crown functions...2nd one in a row,"I have ordered two of these watches in the last 3 weeks and both of them did not function properly.I unscrewed the crown out to the first position (Hand Wind Position), and it does not hand wind, it only spins freely and does not function. The date position works fine. The 3rd position (Hand Position Adjustment) the second hand remains ticking while you are trying to adjust the hands to the correct time which makes it impossible to set the watch to the exact time that you wish. Also, if you move the hands backwards, the second hand will actually tick counterclockwise. This is unacceptable!I sent the first one back immediately and then the 2nd one arrived and it's having the same exact issues. I contacted Invicta directly and that is a waste of time, unless you are OK with paying to ship it to them, and then waiting 3 months to get it back or hear from them."
1,defective right out of the box,"Amazon main review claimed this was as good as a Rolex. It was defective right out of the box. Instructions state to set the time pull the grown out to the first stop and the hand stop. Not so the second had continued to tic away. Impossible to set exact correct time. After reading the warranty, I had question about its true value. Save you money and buy a dependable known brand."
1,"Nice but poor performance, BUT Amazon is more than excelent",Watch gains 30 minutes or more per day. I will return it.Very nice watch. Sorry for quality control which is zero. I bought it despite the bad reviews. For the good were 70%. The low price does not justify the poor quality performance. If INVICTA improves quality control can be a very successful brand.More than excellent care from Amazon. I will CONTINUE shopping with amazon no doubt despite the poor quality control of Invicta.
3,Nice watch at a nice price.,"Got many complements on this watch. Most people think it's a Rolex. I tell them ""It's a Rolex alright with a 5000.00 discount!"".Works great but you have to move it every other day to keep it running, which was expected."
2,Not as nice as I had Expected,"The watch works fine, however I was really excited to get it. I have bought a few invicta watches and honestly not all that impressed with them. Maybe it is just mee but something looks cheap about this watch. Automatic watches are a pain if it isn't an everyday watch and this is more of a dress watch so if you don't wear it every day you are going to need to reset it every time you wear it. I believe the large sport watches are more invictas thing. For something like this I would have rather gone with a citizen or a bulova watch for a little bit more and got something I was proud to wear."
3,Invicta Men's 8928OB Pro Diver Two-Tone Automatic Watch Problem with the order?,"The watch meets mostly with the expectations that consumers have as yet to clean the golden brasalete still follows the same product again, so I think I should worry about the house manufacturer improve its quality, in that sense. Otherwise I'm happy with the watch."
5,"Great Looking, Great Price, Great for a small Wrist!","Originally, I had my doubts about ordering a watch online however this watch is both attractive and reasonably priced. It is perfect for any man or guy with smaller wrists or for anyone who simply likes a watch with a smaller face. It's not too bulky or in any way tacky and it's both classy and affordable! I bought this Invicta watch for a friend at Christmas and he immediately started to get complements on it from other people he ran into and even from the jeweler when he got the watch sized. It is a great investment and a very nice watch."
2,very disapointed...,"I was very disappointed when I took my pro diver watch swimming first time, 3 days after the delivery and to my surprise i discovered the water leaked inside my watch... Other than that the watch looks very nice..."
4,Nice Copy of a 10K Rolex,"If you take a look at the Rolex Submariner this is a direct copy of one. However, if you buy the Rolex version you will be spending $10K for it! I think I can live without the Rolex name. Great value!"
1,Worst customer repair service ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Purchased this watch in July and the second hand fell of in October. Returned it to Invicta in October and after repeated request was informed today(1/23/13) that the watch will be repaired and ship by 4/11/13. Almost 7 months for the repair to be completed.unbelievable.
4,"Great watch, time is meh","So I got this watch for the purposes of picking up chicks at clubs... It's nice, flashy, and most of all it looks almost exactly like a rolex.For the price it can't be beat -- the only slight letdown is that it can't keep time very well. after no readjustments for about a month or two it is a little more than 4 minutes off. But hey, I didn't buy it to keep track of time."
5,GREAT WATCH ON ITS OWN - PRICE A HUGE BONUS,"Take all of the positive and extensive reviews of this watch, roll them into one, and you have my review. I'm writing mainly to offset the one star review: I spent 50 cents and less than a minute at a country jeweler to have two iinks removed. Most jewelers whom you do business with will take out links free so why mail the watch off? This is an outstanding watch!"
1,Returned from repair and still not fixed!,"This Invicta watch was a Christmas gift. It operated from Dec. 25 to Dec. 30th. When it stopped working, it was beyond the 30 day return policy, so I sent it to Invicta for warranty repair. They didn't send me a post card upon receipt (as their warranty states), so I contacted them and was told it should be returned by APRIL 18TH.PART TWO:The ""repaired"" watch was returned on April 6th. Now it gains OVER FIVE MINUTES PER HOUR. So I contacted them via email requesting replacement and they wrote back that they only replace if the watch has the same problem three times. They want me to ship the watch back to them and wait ANOTHER THREE MONTHS while they ship it back to their overseas repair center again. NOT CUSTOMER CONSIDERATE."
4,Lou Review,Quality watch. Pleasing blue dial and bezel. Gains a minutein 48 hrs. That's non unusual for a mechanical watch. Goodfinish and gold plating. Good looking watch.
4,Reliable automatic,"I have owned this watch about a month, worn everyday, keeps time wellfor a mechanical watch, gains 12 seconds in 24 hours. Runs down in about18 hours if not worn. Construction is solid, well made and heavy.Would give it five stars except that the gold plating on the band is verythin and is already wearing through to the base metal on some of the links.A stainless steel band without the gold accent links would probably be abetter choice for everyday wear. This watch looks very similar to Rolexand Tag Heur models that cost thousands."
4,Invicta Mens Watch,"I purchased the watch as a Valentines Gift for my husband. He love it, it looks great. And I received it just in time. Very happy with it. We give it a 4 star"
5,Looks like a Rolex Submariner,This is a really attractive looking watch. It looks just like a Rolex Submariner. A colleague of mine who is into expensive watches grabbed my arm during a conversation and asked if the watch was a Rolex. When I showed it to him he asked for the Invicta website so that he could learn more about these watches. I have not yet worn it for diving but have been swimming with it without any problems. If you don't wear the watch it will stop although you can wind it each day and it is fine. I did take it off to wear another Invicta one weekend and this watch stopped after around 20 hours. It not worth paying a large amount for a Rolex when you have a classy looking watch like this available for a lot less. I have three other Invicta watches but at the moment this is the one I wear all the time.
1,Worthless Junk - Came apart in my hands as I opened the box!,"I don't normally write reviews, but I thought it was necessary this time.I opened the box, took the watch out of the box and when I unscrewed the crown to set the time, the stem came right out of the watch!When I examined the stem it appeared to be made of plastic!The watch feels substantial and looks great - but the internals are nothing but cheap junk no doubt made in China.I would avoid this watch."
5,Great Watch!,"The product was delivered both on time and int he condition promised. Ever since I received it, I can't stop wearing it. The look is timeless(no pun intended) and the compliments are endless. Great watch, great buy!"
2,poor choice,"this watch looks very nice , but looses 5 minutes every week . its a shame that 84 dollar watch looses time . even 5 dollar watches give correct time . i will not buy this watch again"
3,They are plastic!,"I for some reason thought these were going to be metal, so I was initially really disappointed. However, I really wanted red, magnetic containers for my spices so I kept them. When you wash them, water gets caught between the glass and the lid. I popped the glass out to release the water and dry them, replacing the glass afterwards. However, I think in doing that, I made a few of the container lids loose and they fall off the containers easily, which could cause a real mess if I were to put a ground spice in it and then the lid fell off. So a couple of the containers are out of commission already and I wonder if the other lids will become loose."
3,8 months of light,"3 1/2Proving one of, if not the most adept Mogwai emulators, Saxon have been refining the simplistic but profoundly pretty fluctuations often found in the influential Scottish band's earlier material to lullingly pointed effect even on their first of a few generous EP's."
1,Unbelievably noisy!,"For a ""silent"" pump, this is noisier than anything else associated with the aquarium! I just purchased it from Petco and laughed out loud when I started it up. The air hose is completely kinked up and there is not enough power in the device to get air through to the end of the tubing, no matter how much I stretch and smooth it out. I got it for the battery operated convenience, but this will be going back on my next trip out the door.I do not recommend purchasing this item. It's terrible."
3,order takers-----are lost or don't care,"It seems that the customer is always wrong ! Iordered a replacement tarp for my truck,the guy asked if I had a 5.7 or 6.0 . I replied that I had a 5.7 hemi and its hard on gas and that i cant't imagin having a 6.0-------------I recieved a cover that was 5 feet 7 in long !!!!! called to return an they said it was my fault----had to pay return shippiong------got the replacement and it was too wide !!!!-------------calling today and cancel the whole deal and it will end up costing me aroiund 63.78 and have nothing to show for it!!!! stay away from them!!!!!!!!!"
5,WONDERFUL,"I gave this book 5 stars because I love this book. It shows how a young boy can grow a bond with a dog in a few days, and also how hard someone will work to save a life even though they might never see them again. I recommend this book to everyone who loves animals. This book is well-written and it kept my interest.This book is about a kid named William whose grandfather died and his mother got him a dog to help him out with the death.Well the dog seemed perfect but it chased a old horse. And the pond was called Riley was supposed to be euthanized. William and his friends are trying to save his life."
4,One aspect can be improved upon,You advertise the Teeter Hang Ups Inversion Table for use in executing sit ups. If the basic backboard was padded it could be utilized in this manner without pain. I bought the item with the understanding that it could double as a Maxi Cam for executing sit ups. In this I have been disappointed. Kindly advise.
5,Feel it work and enjoy,Bought the Hang Up more as preventive than medicanal. Had to build up to complete inversion. Hanhg there for a few minutes and feel your back 'expand'. Side benefit is additional blood circulation to brain if you can get past that cloudy feeling. You'll feel great with a few minutes a day. I RECOMMEND IT. Ejnoy it.
3,Nice album by a long-lost band,"I loved The Kings - I missed The Kings. I was floored when I saw this release. While not as strong as their debut and follow-up, the first-ever release of Switchin' To Glide/This Beat Goes On is long-overdue. And the title track kicks major butt. I definitely recommend this release if you can find it. Diamond and Zero sound just like they did nearly 20 years ago."
1,Also Ripped Off,"I did not see the first review in the list that also describes my experience with this seller. I also bought the CD for ""Beat Goes On/Switchin to Glide"", which is advertised on Amazon as being on the CD. When I received the CD it did not have that song."
5,Excellent product Sony DFJ200,"I've had this product for months now. I have to tell you, I've had no problems with this CD player. And it really withstands all the drops I've made to it. I dropped this accidently countless times and it is still a fantastic product. I recommend it."
4,This is an good product but the radio is just poor,i brought this a week ago and its relly a good cd player.every thing works just fine but the radio just doen't do it.also the cost it a little too high for this product.i will still consiter you to buy it if you don't use the radio that much.
3,Needs other headphones,"With the provided headphones, radio reception is poor. With a $50 aftermarket set of headphones, its pretty good for strong stations. For weaker stations or those with nearby competition, you have to find the right place to listen.Volume is good.Controls are awful, especially for setting the preset radio stations. Instructions are very poor."
2,"Overpriced, and no MP3","Sony's latest portable CD/AM/FM/TV/WB walkman is a nice player. The sound on the unit is very good, tough not quite as good as Panasonic's. It has 2 equalizers, while may CD players out today have 3.The design is below average. The buttons are poorly placed, and button are hard to find and memorize. The CD player is very slim, which is a plus. Also, the CD player is sturdy and has good construction, as most Sony products.There are many features, such as AM radio, FM radio, TV, and Weatherband, but there is no MP3 feature, which is a big minus. The player does come with a remote, but only very basic features are on it, like play, stop, pause, back, and next. There is a hold button on the CD player and remote.The cost is way overpriced. Most players at this price range have MP3, and have better sound.Overall, the DFJ200 is a flawed and overpriced CD player. Not recommended."
2,Sony's China products debase the brand,"Well, it's better than a string and two dixie cups but rich detailed sound? Not even close. It gives everything a kind of scratchy, other room quality. Had one of these before, made in China too but it sounded better. Ahh, where are the Japanese made Sony products? A quality product for those of us who hate MP3 sound and still carry around CDs? You know, the wanna be audiophile?Don't even bother with the Sony headphones."
4,sony has the best cd's players,well after having dfj401 from sone that one was great the best yet but this cd player is just as good as that one i had to wait sometime for them to come out with it. well it's here&i love it sony i give you A+ for this one thanks& get it don't wait
3,CD Player has No Line Out for use in car,"Previous to this CD Player, I had the Sony D-FJ61, which included a line out for use in the car if you have only a cassette player. I have the Sony cassette adapter for CD Player, but with the D-FJ200, there is unfortunately no line out slot to attach the adapter to. The CD player itself plays fine, but I'm returning it for lack of a line out."
2,Not MP3 compatible!,"ARGH!Silly me for not reading the fine print. I sort of assumed that all CD players of this price range would be MP3 compatible. NOT! Why the heck anybody would make a CD player that isn't MP3 compatible in this day and age is beyond me.The sound quality and construction of this thing are pretty good, better than the Panasonic equivalent. Hence two stars instead of one. But the Panasonic plays MP3s!Have not been able to get much radio reception out of this thing. I do live in a pretty hilly area, and reception in general is pretty bad; however, my el cheapo clock radio does better than this CD player.Anyway, this thing is going back to Circuit City, pronto...."
3,Track Listing,"THIS IS THE THE LISTING OF THE ARTISTS PERFORMING THE TRACKS:We've Never Danced - Martha DavisRomance - R.E.M.I Still Want You - Ric OcasekThere's Only You - Luther VandrossUp the Ladder To The Roof - The NylonsMr. Soul - Buffalo SpringfieldI Am A Child - Buffalo SpringfieldSame Time, Another Place - Mark IshamBeyond The Frames - Mark IshamInstead Of Floating - Mark IshamI purchased the soundtrack for the addition of the 1st track by Martha Davis (of The Motels) to my collection."
1,A total disappointment,"If you're expecting a Mannheim Steamroller version of your favorite Patriotic songs, you will be disappointed. This CD shows nothing of Chips talent like what he has done for Christmas music and even Disney themes.The CD lacks the fibrant and moving experience that IS Mannheim Steamroller. I have all their Fresh Aire and Christmas CD's, I am a loyal MS fan. But I feel Chip let us down with this one.I was expecting Chip's unique flair in the songs ""AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL"", ""HOME ON THE RANGE"", ""BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC"", but instead, I heard nothing of that nature.Sorry Chip, you missed the mark on this one."
4,Necessary for collectors,"I purchased this CD because I'm mostly a fan of C.W. McCall. I agree with one of the other reviews that the ""American Spirit"" track is almost TOO patriotic, but it was fun to listen to as July 4th approached. I really like ""Tin Type"", but I wish they hadn't re-hashed ""Convoy"" again. Other versions are already available on other CD's. I wish they had included ""Old Glory"", since this would have really complemented the other McCall narratives.Overall, if you are a collector of either Mannhiem Steamroller or C.W. McCall albums, this should be part of your collection."
4,Guess I'm not a purist!,"After reading the other reviews, I approached this CD with some trepidation. But, I loved it!! -- especially, the much disparaged ""Convoy"" and ""Wolfcreek Pass"" (laughed out loud at that one). I'm sure there are ""better"" versions of the included songs but, I loved them all!!!"
2,Not what I think of when I think Manheim Steamroller,"This wasn't a bad CD, but it was NOT what you typically think of when you think of Manheim Steamroller music. I was expecting electronica patriotic music. I got a kinda old trucker country sort of music. No wonder it's so cheap compared to the other MS cds..."
1,What an absolute disappontment :(,"I love Mannheim Steamroller, so I was looking forward to listening to their patriotic CD. Wow, I was so disappointed. What on earth were they thinking? ""Convoy""? Really??? Classless :( The rendition of The Star Spangled Banner was underwhelming. They couldn't even get the melody of The Battle Hymn of the Republic correct. There was some corny segment of someone talking with the sound of fireworks in the background. It wasn't even a song. There was also a lot of dramatic music that lead up to nothing. Who put this CD together???? I'm returning this one. Not worth the money at all."
2,too much talking,The music parts of this CD are just what you would expect from Mannheim Steamroller but there are too many vocals - talking and singing.
5,Americana at it's best!,"For anyone who enjoys Patriotic Music. For anyone who is a Manheim Steamroller fan, especially their Christmas albums. This is for you! Awesome!"
2,CW McCall is Chip Davis,Reunited again? They never were apart. If you remove the novelty songs this would be a 3 to 4 star. With them it is barely a two. Buy it used.
5,Very well done!,"Enjoy the variety on this CD. The songs vary from beautiful and patrioic to extremely funny. Though not exactly the classic Mannheim Steamroller style, it is a great collection!"
3,I liked it,I liked the CD overall. The choral numbers build very nicely and Home on the Range is a unique item done in this style.
1,Doesn't Even Deserve a Star,"This is a pretty sad effort over all and 'effort' is giving it too much credit. The arrangements are warmed over at best and I truly question why Chip would release something with such a lack of quality. The work he has done before shows such great originality and then this! Try again, Chip. The country deserves better."
4,one Hull of a book,"Dennis Hull is perhaps best known as Bobby's younger brother or Brett's uncle. Many people (maybe even Dennis) don't realize that Dennis had a very good career.Hull reveals some great unknown stories. The story behind him actually staying with the Blackhawks as a rookie is a classic! Hull speaks candidly about his bigger, more famous brother, Bobby, who left the Hawks for greener pastures in the WHA. He also discusses current star, Brett Hull. Of course, he goes beyond the Hull family and discusses other greats, like Howe, Richard and Lafleur.Dennis Hull is a funny, warm, thoughtful man and it comes across very naturally in his book. One gets the feeling that this book could have been 10 times larger and still not covered all of his experiences."
5,His best so far,"Motherland is Danilo Perez's best. He just seems to improve with every album. I thought he'd reached his zenith after his release of The Journey, then after Panamonk, then after Central Avenue. I'm happy to be wrong, yet again. As a panamanian, this record (and in fact all his records) strike a particular nationalistic vein. In this album, ""Elegant Dance"" was easy to recognize as a ""punto"", a popular dance back home. All his rhythms, techniques, improvisations, just scream ""Latin"". But they're also a universal code, accessible to anyone, from any nationality."
5,The new path,"Motherland is a clear indication that jazz is about to change its path. Danilo Perez is quickly becoming the MIles Davis of this decade. As a fusion master, Danilo Perez has pushed the limits of jazz to new realms ; refreshening, intense but delicate, this album may become a landmark as to the direction jazz music will go from now on. I agree 100% with The new York Times Critic's choice as No.1 pick of the year 2000. On the other hand, the recent nomination to the Grammys on the Latin Jazz Category indicates that the Academy is not yet prepared to recognized this talented panamanian as master pianist/composer/arranger in the jazz genre ( without adjectives) . Its to hard to accept, coming from a latino, that he speaks the jazz language more fluently that most jazz pianists in the world.Watch for more to come from Danilo Perez in the near future."
4,"A full monography from ""la Villette"" To ""le Fresnoy""","This monography of Tschumi is very interesting and show well the conceptual approach in his works. the design of the book is also made by Tschumi himself. We can like or don't like these esthetism, I mean the black and white pictures with low resolution. But nevertheless, this book is a full monography of all the project until the beginning of the 90's. there is a new book planned to follow this one ""Event-cities 2"". So I believe these two books would be good to have in your own library if you want to have a full coverage of tschumi works."
4,Coookie,"We love these cookies and each of us has a favorite. Be it the sugar sprinkled cookies or my favorite, a soft cookie with nut pieces.They have decreased the number of cookies in the box from 2 layers of cookies (appr. 24) to one layer with appr 32 cookies total.Made in Denmark, these cookies do melt in your mouth. Stay with the original and skip the No Cholestrol or other variations."
3,"Not exactly dulcet tones, but interesting lyrics...","I'm not sure why the reviewer below was ""worried that Billy Bragg might be a socialist."" A song listed on the sleeve as ""there is Power in a Union"" should have given the game away. Personally I quite like this album, and I'm a conservative. I used to really be into this as a student a decade or so back, but more the love songs than the political ones. Bragg has a sure touch for awkward romance - eg 'Greetings to the New Brunette' 'The Passion' and 'Warmest Room'. The picture of a dysfunctional family in 'the Home Front' is also touching, as is the bewildered divorced man in 'Honey I'm a Big Boy Now' and the battered woman in 'Levi Stubbs Tears'. A recent relisten gave me one new insight, however - for all Bragg's considerable talents as a lyricist (and he got better than this album, which has a few howlers) he really can't sing very well. No, not as in Mick Jagger, (ie tolerable): more as in your best mates after a few beers. Vocally, a bit raw."
1,In one word: AWFUL.,"I'm serious, no joke. I must say, I have acquired all the other Bragg albums, but this really is the worst of the bunch, and that really disappoints me. I was hoping for a lot, but this really did fall short of my expectations. If you have any money, don't buy this rubbish."
4,A good Socialist Folk CD,"There's a rawness and honesty to avowed Socialist Billy Bragg's lyrics in this, his ""difficult third album,"" that works well with his not-ready-for-prime-time vocals and makes songs like the haunting ""Levi Stubbs Tears"" and the clever ""Marriage"" and playful ""Greetings to the New Brunette"" worth listening to again and again. But those are offset somewhat by the annoyingly anthemic ""There Is Power in a Union"" and ""Help Save the Youth of America,"" which render the last half of the CD far less listenable than the first. Of course, you've got to be somewhat of a Billy Bragg fan to even know this CD exists, in which case you probably already own it... but on the off chance someone just turned you on to Bragg and you've only heard some of his newer stuff, I recommend you give this CD a chance. IMHO it's his best album, with ""Levi Stubb's Tears"" his best song."
1,garden variety platitude,"Looking for an interesting critique of America? Look elsewhere. Baudrillard is your garden variety old European who likes to spill ink. The following citation from the author's ""the Spirit of Terrorism"" illustrates his 'thinking':""That we have dreamed of this event [i.e. the September 11 terrorist attacks], that everybody without exception has dreamt of it, because everybody must dream of the destruction of any power hegemonic to that degree, - this is unacceptable for Western moral conscience, but it is still a fact ... It is almost they who did it, but we who wanted it""Such intellectual atrocities are not uncommon in old Europe. But they are uninteresting. So if you're interested in critical intellecutal discourse about America, you're better off reading the 'Economist'."
2,Surprisingly unoriginal,"Though there are a scattering of trenchant ideas thrown about, there is very little of actual substance to chew on here. The best food for thought comes when the author compares the United States to his French homeland, where his critical eye examines the banalities of both the Old and the New World.The detached examination of American cultural myths does get tedious at points, though Baudrillard pops off a few one-liners here and there to keep the reader awake, and the well-chosen photos punctuate the book nicely."
1,New layout and edition Pales in comparison to Original,"I loved this book in college and look forward to reading it again. Frankly I think he is somewhat ridiculous, but thought provoking and hilarious. I had a girlfriend almost break up with me because she read the book literally and took affront of a French man critiquing the US.Anyhow, my criticism with this edition is that the original version was square in shape and full of nice color pictures. It didn't feel like just another staid french literary criticism book. It felt more like a travel guide-book (though a warped one). Obviously the text is the same as the original and you shouldn't judge a book by it cover, but in this case, layout and design I think make more than a subtle change in how the reader will approach the book.I just did some research. Apparently the original version is still on sale on Amazon. I heartily recommend you purchase this version:America"
1,Poor customer support,"I purchased this product in December 2007, it worked OK for a couple weeks, then developed problems where it would not turn off nor work properly. Even taking the battery off would not completely ""reset"" it. Exchanging it for new one was not an option as Amazon no longer carried the unit. I decided to send it to the Thomson Exchange Center for a replacement unit as outlined in the warranty information. I sent in on Dec 27 and to date have heard nothing back from them. I sent a letter on Feb 7 and again not reply so far. There is no phone number listed for warranty help. Very dissapointed in RCA product."
2,Leaky umbrella,"The umbrella is very compact and easy to use, however after just a few uses it started leaking at the joints. Very dissappointed!"
1,I don't like it,I have no news yet about it. There is no trcking information and I'm still waiting for it. This product is not good for my
4,Great Book,It by Stephen King is a horror novel about seven adults who come together to fight a monster from their childhood. They tried to destroy it when they were children but did not succeed. Now they must bond together to destroy the monster once and for all. It is definitely a book worth reading.
5,DAYWALKIN!,This is the best Siccmade release since Sicx dropped in 99! It will be the best album you hear all year as well! If you ain't got it i'd definetly recomend you swoop it up as soon as possible!
4,pretty nice,This album to no suprise has top quality production.Being the producer on much of the siccmade albums the beats and instumentals are outstanding.His style and delivery will not blow you away but his lyrics are solid and the guest appearances keep the album exciting.Recently I have heard some not so great siccmade albums but this one is worth checking out and he breaks the monotony of the typical sac town rappers with an unorthodox style.A must have if you are a siccmade fan.Check it out.
3,Okay,"I liked it more than Trigganometry and Uthanizm. It all kinda sounds the same. Lynch, Loki, COS, Zagg, D-Dubb are featured plus some of the new guys I don't care about."
4,Four and a half stars,"This album is a direct link from the previous Head On the Door. The songs vary greatly between poppy hits, aching ballads, and Eastern-tinged trip-outs. Yet this album finds the Cure really hitting their stride in all the above styles. ""Why Can't I Be You"" and ""Just Like Heaven"" are great pop hits, ""One More Time"" and the title track are great painful ballads, and the rest of the album stands strong; ""Catch"" and ""the Perfect Girl"" being favorites. This album perfected all that came before it and remains one of their best."
3,Just an okay,Excellent music! A must buy for someone into this type of music but need to jump tracks to get the musical enjoyment.
4,simply kissed,"Being a hella huge Cure fan, I can honestly say that this cd is good. Of course, this is only my opinion, and it is somewhat biased. ALthough, on this cd, Robert gets in with poppy stimulus. I enjoy bopping around to this cd as I clean or just to get my in a good mood. It is completely on the other spectrum of Faith and Bloodflowers, but just as good. Enjoy!"
4,lost,roberts most eccentric work. it captures something he could never catch again. maby 1987 was the last good ol american year
4,Wild and Moody.,"This is one of the better Cure record to explore a variety of sounds imo. You have a ton of stuff to go over here and the bonus disc is packed with some goodies and instrumentals. The hit Just Like Heaven is here but really the quality of the disc is mostly top notch. Songs like Icing Sugar, Like Cockatoos, How Beautiful You Are, Snakepit, and Why Can't I Be You show them at their most creative. The whole album is finally here to as opposed to the old CD which cut the last song and I think they did a nice job remastering for an audience both new and old. It's not too loud but they brought up the levels a bit and it sounds good with intact dynamics. I would say Disintegration, Bloodflowers, and Seventeen Seconds are indeed better off the top of my head but this one is up there with their good records. The recording quality itself isn't really the best imo but this one as always sounded that way."
5,Marvelous!,"This is simply marvelous. You don't have this Cure album yet? Get it NOW! I saw the Cure perform ""Like Cocatues""(sp?) and it changed my life!"
4,Great Music,"Robert Smith has a compelling voice and great lyrics. This was the first Cure album I listened to, and I was impressed.""One More Time"" is absolutely one of the best love songs I've ever heard! Even in this year 2000, it sounds fresh and relevant. It's worth buying the whole album. This song is the BOMB."
3,Problematic,"Firstly, the CD is still missing Hey You, even though modern CD players can play 80 minute discs. Further, it's missing the songs Breathe and A Chain of Flowers, which are B-sides that should have been included since they're better than songs that made the cut like Torture, Fight, and The Perfect Girl.This CD desperately needs to come out in remastered form (no clipping or compression in the remastering process, please) with Breathe, A Chain of Flowers, and Hey You."
5,One More Good Cd from The Cure.....,"Lyrics and the beats are to die for. This is just another great cd from the Cure, and they are still hitting people with unpredictable waves of sound. Get this cd if you don't already own it!"
5,This is The Cure...,"This may not be a book, though this CD is wonderful. Compared to most other Cure music, this is happier & poppier, though songs like ""Why Can't I Be You"" (which is a great song) can really get a party started. Believe me, I've tried it. ""Just Like Heaven"" is a treasure & by most Cure fans & non-Cure fans seem to be the most favoured work of The Cure. I give this CD a '10' because it is really worth every penny & it ranges moods from happiness to wild nonsense to melancholy (""A Thousand Hours"" is one of those). All in all, this is really worth at least a good listen. END"
3,"Great music, bad product.","Many will tell you that this is The Cure's best album, and they are right. This CD, however, is just another example of Warner Brothers' thrifty laziness. WB as a record company has always had a bad reputation and this CD is one more reason why. First, there is a track missing from the original double vinyl set. You see, when this album was first released on CD back in 1990, they could fit only 74 minutes of music on them, so they had to cut one song. But now CD's can hold up to 80 minutes of audio, yet WB refuses to remaster this album. Fifteen years has gone by since these songs were recorded, and the sound could really use a good digital clean-up. Will WB ever do it? Probably not, unless we all flood WB's website with e-mails on this very subject..."
5,Check It Out,"Simultaneously more accessible and ambitious than any of the Cure's previous albums, the double-album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me finds Robert Smith expanding his pop vocabulary by tentatively adding bigger guitars, the occasional horn section, lite-funk rhythms and string sections. It's eclectic, to be sure, but it's also a mess, bouncing from idea to idea and refusing to develop some of the most intriguing detours. Even if Kiss Me doesn't quite gel, its best moments - including the deceptively bouncy ""Why Can't I Be You?"" and the stately ""Just Like Heaven"" - are remarkable and help make the album one of the group's very best."
4,Their best work,"The stinging guitar riff in ""The Kiss"" should alert you that this is not your older sibling's foppy new-wave. Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me is 2 LPs worth of Robert Smith's sprawling musical world. From the haunting ""Catch"" to the spiteful ""How Beautiful You Are"" to the party-ready ""Hot Hot Hot"" (not the Buster Poindexter tune) this album easily rates as the group's best. ""Just Like Heaven"" is the single best song in their repertoire, and it's a shame it did not become a U.S. hit. There are a few clunkers here--""Hey You,"" for example, sounds like a work in progress. But overall most everything clicks."
1,crap,this cd is horrible. pearl jam lions is a piece of garbage and all he listens to is whiny british babys (i.e) the cure and radiohead. i agree with pearl jam being good but bashing talented bands like creed & limp bizkit is just wrong. pearl jam lions probably likes coldplay too and every other british whiny band. sorry pearl jam lions but we're all waiting for the cure to break up if they haven't yet. if they did no one would notice anyway cause nobody buys their records anymore anyway. radiohead's audience shrinks with each album and they just plain suck. sorry pal hahaha!!!
5,IM THE FIRST REVIEWER!!,... calibretto has changed from their past albums adding organs and darker lyrics but really unique. When i heard they were naming their new album after evil dead 2:dead by dawn i [was excited] cause the 2 things i love the most united. anyways the cd has good christain messages and its all around good...
5,A MASTERPIECE!!!,"Easily Calibretto's best to date!!! They're incredible. They tell it like it is. These guys aren't fooling around anymore, for this is their darkest and most convicting and thought provoking album yet. If you liked their previous stuff then get ready to kick it up a notch with the Dead by Dawn EP, and be sure that you'll be impressed. I strongly recommend this CD. It's definately a must have. I mean now, buy it now!!!!"
2,Editor needed!,"This promising and potentially important historical study is all but ruined by the author's inability to control his subject matter. There's no denying that Hennessy knows his stuff. What he *doesn't* know is how to write. In a phrase, this book is a mess. It rambles, wanders, and meanders through fifty years of history and politics. For most readers (certainly this one) the result is a series of anecdotes. I should add that an American edition should have included a glossary of political terms and abbreviations. All in all, a disappointing piece of work that promised so much."
5,Awesome!!!,everything I hoped it would be. Take a dive into the mind of Bruce Lee and enjoy what has become a major part of martial arts.
2,its all over the place,"I was hoping for some sort of Bruce Lee ""bible"" of sorts but its just a collection of unfinished scribbles and thoughts. I have a very high regard for B.L., his movies and his characters (and thoughts) but this book is all over the place and very inconsistent."
5,Library Essential,"Tao of Jeet Kune Do could best be described as a training diary for the martial arts. It does not represent a style of martial art, rather it defines a concept within the martial arts. Lee combines his knowledge of the fighting arts and physical training methods with his philosophy of ""using what will work for you."" This book does not just explain basic techniques, it also explains how to best use these techniques when confronted with a hostile situation. Basic techniques, training methods, strategy and philosophy all in one book. Quite a feat for such a young author. If you are truly interested in improving yourself through study of the martial arts, then you should consider adding this book to your martial arts library. Other books to consider are ""The Art of War"" by Sun Tzu and ""Karate-Do Nyumon"" by Gichin Funakoshi. These books are considered basic reading since they discuss strategy and history of the martial arts. There are no limits except those we place on ourselves."
3,The Tao of Jeet Kune Do wasn't written by Bruce Lee,"This book may be quite a good read, and yes, was done when Bruce had his injured back, but he didn't write it. He took notes from all the different martial arts books he could get his hands on and wrote them in journels. They were published after he died. Great to get an overview."
1,Disappointed,Was expecting a lot more instead of basically Bruce's notes presented in an all most comic book form. If you took out all the over spacing this book would be perhaps 30 pages? Plus side is you see Bruce's thoughts and insight on paper.
2,Not as hopefull as it appears,"Maybe is my knowlegde of the English Language or the Book isn't really that good. I have spent 3 months in a hospital last year after I've been attacked by GRACIE JIU JITSU students in my own School. After I have recovered myself from the encounter I decided start training Martial Arts hardly and what would be better than learning JKD - I throught -. Man, how could I've been so blind. After training for 7 months and a half, those guys challenged me again, I fought and I got myself pretty hurt again. I sold this book (and the 5 other ones: 4 BRUCE LEE'S FIGHTING METHOD and CHINESE GUNG FU.) I don't know what to think except that fact that I think what made of Lee the Greatest Martial Artist in the World was the fact that he was strong (full of muscles, while I'm pretty thin), that way he could make his opponents get scarry, afraid or maybe I'm such a weak looser who not even knows how to use the mind anymore in high school."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS LIKE,"I don't know what's the big problem me or the books isn't really that good. I've spent 3 months inside a hospital after I was attacked by GRACIE JIU JITSU students in my own school. After I have recovered myself I decided to learn Martial Arts and I thought - What would be better than learning JKD, Lee's Art -. I practiced by 7 months and then those guys wanted to fight with me again. I got pretty hurt again. I got so angry and upset that I sold this BOOKS (and 4 others LEE'S FIGHTING METHOD plus CHINESE GUNG FU). I realized that these things of Martial Arts are just cheap talk specially when talking about LEE !!!"
1,Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!,"I ordered this for my friend, he says:Book arrived really fast BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The ""like new"" book had ketchup and guacamole stains on the inside pages. It was highly damaged. The book had water damage to it and the pages are stuck together. I'm quoting him (and in a nice way) He says F to the U. No one buy from this (dumb).... ass (me putting it nicely).P.S. The seller gets ONE star, just because you HAVE to put a star. Otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten anything!!!!!!"
1,indecipherable gobblety-goop,"Although this book is ""composed"" of incoherent scratchings, many people regard Bruce Lee as a genius because of it. How sad."
5,Bruce Lee is my hero.,Books reads more like a reference book but I like it. I can thumb through it and find something I am interested and read about that. I train western boxing and there is some very useful information in this book! Great philosophic material in the beginning as well!
5,"Pointing the way to ultimate ""self"" defense - a great work","A real eye opener on how to approach the martial arts and to a well defined explanation of the concept of ""self defense"". Absorb what is useful and disregard the rest."
5,A life-altering book,"Bruce Lee's Tao of Jeet Kune Do has affected me personally , in a way that not only includes the martial arts but how I live my life. His unique brand of philosophy which combines elements of Taoism ,Zen , Buddism , Confucianism and various other philosophies has given my insight and inner calm during times of stress or depression by giving me a clearer view of my own life. His philosophy of looking at things unclouded by personal preference opened my mind. I have read the book countless times to the point where the book cover has worn off. A great book which has philosophies that can be applied to all avenues of life."
5,The Distillation of Fighting Arts & Philosophies into JKD,"This book is a recommended addition to your martial arts education, along with the series of books that Bruce Lee authored for Ohara Publications. Quite simply, it is a working notebook of wise sayings, applications, and diagrams of important techniques which Bruce Lee gathered while contemplating his Jeet Kune Do. There is much practical food for thought here. As a continuing student of Judo, I found the author's notes on throwing and grappling techniques, while brief, to be very insightful."
5,A man way ahead of his time.,"This collection of Bruce Lee's writings on Jeet Kune Do, is just fantastic. Any student of any martial art should have a copy of this in their library.The theories illustrated here are so advanced that I probably only really understand 50 percent of the book. Anybody looking for a quick fix book on fighting theory is going to have to look elsewhere. This book is not just a guide to a style, but also a total indepth philosophy of FIGHTING.Great stuff!"
4,Bruce Lee....,"I love Bruce Lee, but I couldnt get into this book! I cant honestly tell you to read it or not, because I havent! I bought it here at Amazon and gave it away a month later! Watch ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"", thats a classic!"
3,Very technical. Simply for a dedicated martial artist,"Complicated but good for a dedicated martial artist looking to learn the ways of Jeet Kune Do. I bought this book looking for a less complex look into Bruce Lee's style. If you are not a practicing martial artist, then you wont get far into this book without being overwhelmed with diagrams."
4,Awesome Book,"I ordered this book to replace an old copy that I had and lost somewhere. This is an awesome book, and is my 4th time reading it. Master Lee's principles, philosophies, and methods never get old, and they can change your life."
4,Tao of Jeet Kune Do,"I used this video tape to practice and learn Bruce Lee style of fighting. Actually doing it over and over while watching the video helped me master some of the good techniques. By the way, I have intermediate skills in marcial arts and found this video to be helpful.."
5,Great Book written by the legend,"Once I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down. Bruce Lee's philosophy and method of training is one of the best. The book helps you understand the art of Jeet Kune Do and the martial artist philosophy as well. Bruce explains how important it is to control your opponent and explains the techniques on how to do it, by proper timing, speed and technique. It is a must have in any martial artist's personal library."
5,tao of jeet kune do,"this book is a good buy if your interested in learning some of what bruce lee accomplished,and is one of the best sources on jeet kune do"
5,The truest treatise on the philosophy of JKD...,This is a good book for understanding the physical and philosophical ideals of Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do.
5,One Man's Opinion,"This is just one man's opinion. He knew it, too. This man was the real deal. Reading his book is not a look at martial arts, but a look at a real human being's mind."
5,Tao of Jeet Kune Do (Updated version),"The publishers did an excellent job of repackaging the original version. The updated layout and increased size of Bruce Lee's sketches makes it much easier to read.I did not care for the additional comments by Linda Lee Caldwell, Shannon Lee and others who were not very subtle in pushing their political agenda in the on-going Lee family verse the Inosanto Concepts group saga. Other than that minor speed bump in the road I really like the updated release of this classic book.Here are my top three reasons to recommend the new edition:1. The layout of the material is improved and easier to read thanks to a new font type.2. The illustrations are much clearer and larger than the original version3. Newly added translations from some of the Chinese that was not translated well or at all in the original book adds to the value of this edition."
5,mma + streetfighters -read this.,"no style is new---This book shows the research of Bruce lee's personally preferred fighting methods. it is of course incomplete. Covers modern boxing, trapping, kicking and yes even grappling. As well as his philosophy. The JKD stance worked for Bruce, same as a square stance works for Bas (book does not cover square stance). Will it work for you? Try it and see. P.S. You will also notice the corkscrew punch is the same punch employed by fedor and liddell. Bruce didn't invent the punch, but he used it.--- no style is better."
5,good bok,excellent for exercising I thought it gave a good insight into improving your skills or learning a new way of thought
4,"Get the ""Fighting System Books"" to go with Tao of JKD","This is the blueprint book for the world's greatest martial (non)art--Jeet Kune Do. While everything you need is here, it's not exactly the most ""linear"" book you'll read. If you pick up the 4 volumes of ""The Bruce Lee Fighting System"" (about $6 each), this will all make even more sense. You'll get to see most of this stuff being practiced in the pictures and explained even more clearly. Get 'em both, and work hard!"
5,This book has eveything you are looking in a Bruce Lee book.,"If you wont a Bruce lee Book Get this one.Dont wast your money on the other one.this is the truly the best book out.I have Bruce Lee's Fighting Method Vol.1,2,and 3 but this one has more for a less price"
4,Excellent release!,"Ed Harcourt is a masterful singer/songwriter who recorded this 6-tracks mini album in his home studio. On Maplewood he's crafted little, precious songs that are definitely woth a listen. As Amazon.co.uk states, you'll hear echoes of Tom Waits, Bono (the first time I listened to ""Apple of my eye"" I almost mistook the singer's voice for Bono's) and spaghetti western. The first songs reminds me of The Blue Nile but it's probably just a feel... Whatelse can I say? I wish it was a bit longer, after all he claims to have written hundreds of songs already."
5,You've got to hear this,"I lived next to kazy and his crew when I was at junior college, and let me tell you these boys are for real! Their sound is like no other,and it's nice to see a leader in the rap game instead of just another follower. Kaz if there is any chance you end up reading this it's me O.J. I've lost your number and have no way of getting a hold of you. If you get this message or anyone with information about my long lost bro. please e-mail me at jones0@cwu.edu Thank you, and Keep It real Kaz."
4,Good Reggae. Great Music to Put a Smile on Your Face.,"I bought this CD for Stages in life (things in life) because I loved listening to it on Chungking Express(my favorite movie of all time). Lucky for me, the whole album is really fun. It's the only other Reggae I have besides Bob Marley's ubiquitous ""Legend"", and I'm very happy I got it!"
4,Great original deep house,Shibuya Flavas gives a little taste of the hard to come by tokyo deep house scene. DJ Alex put together a wonderful collection of tracks from such artists Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra and Men at Work. Most of the tracks on here you wont hear on other albums. nicely blending deep house with a bossa nova type groove kicked in. If your looking for a deep house album that isnt the same old tracks. Give Alex a try.
5,Don't change that song... turn it up!,"The worst part of this album is when it's over! Faster Pussycat, masters of fat licks, kings of wicked satirical lyrics and possessors of a certain type of grunge that would make Eddie Vedder run to the nearest free clinic for a booster shot. BUY THIS ALBUM, steal it, burn it or whatever you have to do... Dust it off this lost 80's gem and give them a second listen! You can't be disappointed.The Cathouse may be gone, but these rockin tunes live on forever."
3,A few hits and a few misses,"Bathroom wall was probably the best song on this CD. As a freshman CD it was a good effort, but as with most bands they appear to get better as they went along."
3,A bit of fun,"Faster Pussycat identify with the 'hair metal' movement, as their image overtly suggests. However, in many ways, the band they most resemble is the grunge group 'Mudhoney' - I guess it's something in their delivery, singer Taime Downe has more of a punk delivery than a hard rock one. While acts like Warrant, Extreme and Winger champion their technical virtuoso, these guys play with a carefree, reckless abandon; much like Mudhoney.But there is no point in over-analysing a band called 'Faster Pussycat' - they're a bit of fun, don't take themselves seriously. They're fun while they're on, and that's more or less it. They ain't Earth-changing but good for a bit of enjoyment."
3,Faster Pussycat's best album,"This album is much better than any of their others. There's plenty of good sleaze-rock to be had here and much less filler than on, say, ""Wake Me When It's Over."" The sound is rawer and the tunes more memorable.Highlights:""Bathroom Wall"" is an '80s sleaze classic, though it seems to owe alot to Poison's ""Talk Dirty to Me."" Still fun.""No Room for Emotion"" is a surpisingly mellow Stones-y tune that is more mature and flowing than I would have expected from these boys.""Babylon"" is good pop-sleaze which is fun despite the ANNOYING scratching.Overall, the album is a fairly generic slice of '80s glam metal, but if you're a fan of the genre you won't feel cheated."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS.,Its my own fault for not reading the reviews first. Take everything negative all the other reviews have said and then add that mine only lasted three days before burning out and taking the USB port it was plugged into with it. DO NOT BUY THIS.
3,cool little USB fan,"This is a great little fan but I wish it worked on both Mac and PC. It only works on Mac like the description says, but why only Mac?The only issue is that it uses a lot of power. You'll notice you mac laptop battery will get sucked quicker when using it."
2,"Cheap to buy, but cheap to own","This was very inexpensive and is still working, BUT it has become louder every day. We use it to cool an Xbox in a cabinet. For about a week or so it was quiet and the light is really cool. After that it just became louder and louder. Can't beat the price, but would be worth a few bucks more to have at least a little quality to it."
1,USB Mobile port Mini,I bought the fan and not even a week later it stopped working so I am very unhappy with what I bought.Thank you
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"If I could give this negative stars I would. I failed to look at the reviews before purchasing this fan. When I opened the plastic envelope...yes envelope...I saw that the blades on the fan are extremely cheap and poorly made. They are made of a vinyl/thin plastic material...and I do mean THIN. It is so thin that it was folded over and creased, almost to the point of being wadded up like a ball of used paper. I unfolded the blades and tried to smooth them out as best I could and plugged it in to the computer. As I suspected there was very little air movement coming from the fan. The only way I can feel it is to put my face almost on the fan and even then it isn't enough air to cool. I usually always read the reviews on everything I purchase on Amazon but for some reason I forgot...lesson learned."
5,works for me,I don't use the fan with a laptop. I use it with my monitor usb port at work. This fan is a perfect space saver with a breeze to keep me comfortable all day.
1,Absolutely worthless!,"Don't waste your $$$$. If the rubberish blades get bent, it will not move any air.There are far better USB Fans on here for a little more $$$$."
1,not worth the $ or energy consumption,"does not move any airflimsy ""blades"" made of thin plasticbetter USB fans available. not worth the power required to run it!wish I had not purchased."
1,Disapointment,I got really disappointed with this product. It's noisy and inefficient. I don't recommend it.
3,USB Mobile Port Mini Fan,I purchased this fan for my son and he loves it. It gives off just enough air to keep him cool while studying on his laptop. The length is good and the price was right.
4,Works Just Fine,"I've had one of these for years, and it continues to work just fine even if a bit noisy. It moves a decent amount air even with just those two little, flexible, plastic blades. I especially like it because the blades fold, making storage in my already over crowed backpack a ""breeze"". sry... couldn't resist)"
4,Easy,"This pot is the perfect size. It cooks great and cleans easy. It is also beautiful enough to serve in. I have used it often since my purchase and have not been disappointed. It is one of my most expensive pieces, but I think it will last a life time."
5,Pretty on Table,I can cook the larger meal and serve at the party.Looks so pretty on the table.Guests I invited are also liked.
5,Back in the old days,"I first remember watching the video for Wild Side when I was very young. I loved the way they made the music sound. As I progressed through the CD, I took note of how the songs were written. Jailhouse Rock was okay, but when I put the CD on my MP3 player I omitted it. I loved the You're All I need song very good. Brings back a lot of memories as I listen to it."
5,Pure Testosterone Hair Metal,"If there was ever one album to sum up the hair metal era...this one would be it. you may think this album is cheesy and old, but it still kicks ass...18 years later!!"
3,this album is a punky drug induced slamfest,"the crue are capable of much better work. this album has the same guitar lick (or it sounds like it) on just about every song. the albums only saving grace is girls girls girls, wild side, dancing on glass, all in the name of...and youre all i need my personal favorite song by the crue."
3,I love Rock N' Roll!!,"This CD is not Motley Crue's best, but it does have it moments. ""Wild Side"", ""Your All I Need"", and ""Girls,Girls,Girls"" make this CD. They even do a pretty good job on Elvis's ""Jail House Rock"" live! Sure in 1987 this was all the rage, but these days I'll take ""Dr Feelgood"" any day!!"
5,One of their two best.,"This is the album that got me into Motley Crue. The first two songs, WILD SIDE and GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS just set the stage for the rest of the album. The rippin' guitars of Mick Mars and Vince Neil's unique vocal sound are what truly make this album great. ALL IN THE NAME OF... is a salute to rock n' roll that just blows you away. I especially like their remake of Elvis Presley's JAILHOUSE ROCK...it's a lot faster than the original and a real blast. A definite must have."
3,cheesy motley,"back in the 80's, the crue rocked my world and could not do anything wrong. after the one-two sucker punch of too fast and shout, nothing would or could stop the greatest heavy metal band since, well, you know the drill. looking back now, i cant believe how naive i was back then. this, along with theatre of pain, are what i consider the weakest links in the motley crue chain of albums. not only does it sound dated, it also presents a band unsure of what they wanted. Sure, girls girls girls and wild side rocked, but everything goes downhill after that. this is forgetful pap and ranks with ToP as my least played motley cds. id still get this just to complete my collection but, as i have said in my other review, if you opt to get the definitive classic motley cd, get shout. and too fast for that matter. leave this alone if you are not a crue fan because chances are, you'll stay that way if you hear this..."
4,A very good rock album,"GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS, is a good rock album. The band gave up their glam look, and went for a tough looking street look complete with harleys and leather. I tend to look past their looks, and instead listen to the music. This album is harder then TOP, and considering that this album was made when the band was at its lowest this album rocks. WILDSIDE, GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS, ALL IN THE NAME OF, ALL I NEED, JAILHOUSE ROCK are the standout tunes I think from this album. ALL I NEED is a great ballad that talks about killing your girl becasue you love her so much. ALL IN THE NAME OF is a killer blues type rocking song that I can listen to over and over again. Of course WILDSIDE, GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS are just classic rock songs that will never go away. Of the bonus tracks, RODEO is a killer song that I enjoy and probably would have been a hit had it been released all those years ago. All in all, I find this a good album to rock to."
3,"Good, but not great","This is the album in which Motley let the drugs take over their creativity. Thank goodness they were able to bounce back after this and reclaim their throne. Two songs on this alum are incredible, ""Wild Side"" and ""You're All I Need"". The later is probably Motley's finest ballad, and the former is probably their best live song. There is no bad song on here but some are a lot less inspired than their previous works and their future successes. Good party album but if you look deeper, there isn't much there. There is a killer version of the old Elvis tune ""Jailhouse Rock"" burried in the mix though; a definate classic."
2,VERY WEAK,"This is a waste of valuable money. This album has two okay sings (Wild side + title cut) - after that everything stinks. This album is hard to listen to it's so boring. This is without a doubt their worst album, although I hear Generation Swine is pretty bad too, but I have no intention of wasting anymore money on these losers."
2,"Crappy Title, Crappier Album","Don't get me wrong, I love the Crue but, come on, Girls Girls Girls? That seems rather unoriginal. ""Wild Side"" & ""Five Years Dead"" are great tracks but the album as a whole just doesn't hold water. The songwriting & album concept seemed to be a little one dimensional ""Chicks and Booze"" but maybe that's what they were shooting for. Ok if you can find it used."
4,motley does it all .,"The second best motley cd,dr.feelgood is thee king. The video for girls,girls,girls alone, could sell ten million copies. song like wild side, just rock, cover jailhouse rock is very very good. MOTLEY CRUE is one of the hair band era best."
3,VERY AVERAGE FOR THE CRUE,"GIRLS,GIRLS,GIRLS IS A DECENT RELEASE. BUT IF IT WERE NOT FOR WILD SIDE AND DANCIN ON GLASS THIS ALBUM WOULD HAVE RATED 2 STARS. BOTH SONGS ARE EXEPTIONAL IN CONCERT, ESPECIALLY WILD SIDE."
1,Worst Crue Record!,THIS IS WATERED down Crue. I didn't really like it or the new look here. Only good songs are the singles and my fave Your All I Need. Which is one of my best Crue songs ever. 1 1/2 stars
2,The keypad failed first time out,"I'm sure Garrett makes a good product all in all, but the one I purchased, a Garrett GTI 1500, failed on the first time out. In order to pinpoint and look a the size of your target, you have to press and hold the ""treasure imaging"" button on the keypad. Well, this particular keypad and button was poor quality and the button got stuck in the activate mode. I had to send the detector back. I recently paid more money for a different and better quality detector, and the extra money has been worth every penny. I'm not saying this is a bad detector and the one I purchased may have just been a lemon, but you get what you pay for.The refunding experience was OK. I had to send several emails and make several phone calls, but in the end, I was refunded. Garrett complained because I used a different box to return the detector, but the original box was so beat up when I received the package that I couldn't re-use it."
4,Mineral Ascorbates Are Best,"Vitamin C with mineral ascorbates is gentler on my stomach. It's been said that without minerals, vitamins are virtually useless. Granted, the pills are too huge for children to swallow, but they test the gag reflex wonderfully. I bow my head slightly and the pills slide right down."
4,It's easier than I thought!,"Cato uses a Dremel tool to engrave glass -- and it's much simpler than I thought. He takes you through step by step on creating a picture on a flat pane of glass. Although he creates detailed, gorgeous pictures of birds, you can use the same techniques for simpler stuff.This is not a Hollywood production, but if you ever had an urge to engrave your name or house number on your front door window, this is for you."
2,"Should have been renamed to ""Matrix Remixed""","This CD basically contained techno music that were remixes of matrix sounds, and only a few of them were actually from the animation itself. That wasn't what I wanted. Now I'm going to have to go out and search for the missing songs (Most notably, ""Beyond"") and probably pay extra money for them."
4,Very good.,"While I do agree with some of the reviewers on how not all of the album is solid, most of it is. With tracks like ""Who Am I?"". ""Blind Tiger"", and, on occasion, ""Under The Gun"", it almost feels like a trip-hoppyish-type sound, which I really enjoyed.If you dig the sort of Downbeat music that I've loved ever since I heard Massive Attack, I'd say this is a worthy buy. And while not all of the songs are ""great"" ( ""Red Pill, Blue Pill"") The rest of the album is very enjoyable, especially as a soundtrack!"
2,Over and over and over and over...,"I bought the dvd/cd combo, and I regret it every day I stare at my Animatrix box. The cd is the same thing over and over again. Hell, one song is 7-8 minutes of ""Red Pill, Blue Pill, Red Pill, Blue Pill."" They don't even change the way it's said, I thought my cd player was broken. Unfortunatly, I wasn't lucky enough for it to be broken."
4,an enigma,i've enjoyed most of the soundtracks on the animatrix cd but as i watch the movie i always miss sumthin outta it...does someone out there posses info on where i could get the soundtrack played when the girl goes lookin for her cat in the wiered building and finds them boys playin with the nature of the building...?and then just when the girl picks the feather from its hovering mode..the cat scares a white dove into flight then the music that i'm lookin for begins...if someone out there knows what i'm lookin for...plz page me on erwogera@hotmail.com
5,Wow~!!,"This is some great music compiled together into a perfect cd. I own every single matrix soundtrack and this one I couldn't miss. It's simply great. I listen to this album on my stereo 24/7 and won't stop listening until I probably get sick of it, which shouldn't happen too soon. Anyway buy this cd!!!"
4,"Good, but not great","This CD has some really excellent tracks, some OK ones, and some that make you scratch you head with ""what-were-the-artists-thinking"" kind of bewilderment. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the track Masters of the Universe (when the Kid is escaping the Agents on his skateboard), amazingly, is omitted. However, the first track (the ""credits"" music), Supermoves, and Conga Fury are great fun to listen to.As for the genre itself, Trance seems to me to be the equivalent of classical music for our time. Some is good, some is bad, but it all gives you a sense of free-mind feel, without words or lyrics or pop influences mucking up the experience of the music itself. If that makes any sense..."
3,"It's good, but.....","I wouldn't pay almost 20 smackers for it--that's too much of a rip-off since so many tracks are missing (hell, my favorite short on the movie was ""Beyond,"" the rest are just ok. Where's the ""Beyond"" music, hmmm?? Fortunately, unlike many on here who are ticked off about not getting ""Masters of the Universe"" from the short ""A Kid's Story,"" I already owned the Juno Reactor Shango CD before I came to own the animatrix album, so I don't feel violated by record labels or whatever ;) WARNING: Don't read the next sentence if you bought this CD for almost 20 buckaroos from any major CD retailer/electronics store b/c it will make you very angry.... I actually found this CD as part of a combo pack with the DVD movie at a Dollar General store, mwhahahahaha!! and it was brand new, mawhahahahahaha!!! And I only paid $6 for both the DVD and the CD mwahahahahahahah, I'm queen of the world!!!! sorry, i'm just feeling rather money-savvy right now."

4,Romance Lovers Rejoice!,"Forty-two year old Ilianna Marshall has a job, a house, her hobbies, and a best friend, but no romance to erase the remnants of an unhappy marriage and lonely nights. Attending a powwow and meeting Chebon Charboneau, a Native American, remedies that problem. The two share a weekend of love that will last for a lifetime--she hopes and he promises. She hopes she's not being used. She doesn't want to be just a powwow pickup. She wants desperately to believe Chebon's promises, but should she?Leanna Potts writes a fulfilling story of a woman's hunger for love and the cost of satisfaction. Lovers of romance stories will savor every moment Ilianna and Chebon spend together. And, the way the book ends, romance lovers will beg for the sequel."
4,Powwow Pickup,"In spite of a history of painful personal relationships, Illianna Marshall decides to become involved with Native American Grassdancer Chebon Charboneau. The author skillfully and sensually describes the sounds, scents, sights and tastes of a modern day powwow. Ms. Potts lets the reader listen to the powerful voice of the dance drums, see the colorful costumes of the dancers and feel the sultry approach of a summer storm. She also tells the compelling story of a woman newly awakened to the possibilities of emotional and physical commitment and who dares to follow her heart - no matter what the consequences. I hope I don't have to wait too long for Ms. Potts' next book."
5,Waiting for the rest.,I could relate so well to most of the characters in the book. I found it very difficult to put the book down and can't wait for the sequel(s).
4,Very touching,"The paintings in this book are by far the best thing. They are absolutely breathtaking! Wonderful that the lyrics are printed in English, in Kanji, and that the piano music is printed on each song. Lovely!"
4,A wonderful book for children of the world,"This book is a great way for children to be introduced to Japan and some of its charm. As a parent, when our daughters were young, my wife and I got books of stories and songs from all over the world for them. Not only do the songs resonate with children, but they are wonderful way to introduce the ""World"" to young people - rather than only on the news. Through music we understand the ""sameness"" that we share. This book was purchased for a grandchild as a way to begin the process of taking him by the hand into this wonderful world."
4,strange but solid,"Queenan is a witty fellow---in a serious way, not in a moronic way like John Stewart or Stephen Colbert. Though Queenan makes some silly remarks about race and politics, the book is very creative and clever. He really hits along the lines of why sports fans are the way they are in a very honest way. Those who dislike this book were likely offended by his frankness or just didn't understand his thesis. A good read. And the one or two historical errors do not ruin the book, though some may think so foolishly."
1,Queenan is an idiot.,"I will not read anything this man writes and nor should you - he publicly cries out about and pans Al Gore's documentary ""An inconvenient truth"" (NPR Movies 6-15-07 - listen to the podcast) using the medium of radio to spread his own ignorant and bitter opinions. As far as Queenan is concerned we should not be paying for documentaries that enlighten us and inform us (but should pay for his books!) He's obviously a humanity hater, a planet hater and a Gore hater and an ignorant idiot. I would not reward this kind of person with purchasing his book."
2,Broke after only 6 months,6 months of service and it broke. Also noisy. I am not sure I would buy this pump
5,Un libro que hacia falta.,"En esta fascinante obra, aprendemos a invocar los Santos para solicitar su ayuda e intervención en nuestros problemas y demas situaciónes de la vida diaria. Una guia que aunque no menciono algunos Santos(as) tradicionales, se puede conciderar muy completa."
1,I have not received the product!!,I have not received the book as in so far.... I wrote about this in the past... please help will be appreciated
4,Todo sobre los Santos,El libro es informativo. Me ha ayudado a ententer varios santos. Me gusta ya que integra la religion catolica a la creancia de los santos y el uso de sus poderes.
3,SANTOS?,"Este libro deveria de haberse llamado ""el uso de las veladoras de novena en la magia"" porque unicamente muestra una gran variedad de veladoras de vaso las llamadas de novena (de 7 dias) para distintos usos y una gran variedad en sus apliciones para diversas situaciones, preparandolas con los diversos tipos de aceites y usando los salmos de la biblia junto con el conjunto de varias veladoras, y donde estan el uso de los SANTOS? jamas lo encontre, solamente hace una mencion al comienzo del libro con una lista de algunos santos y virgenes pero no muestra ni rituales, ni formulas, ni oraciones (solo como 2 donde invoca a algunos santos)ni invocaciones para solicitar la ayuda de los diversos santos.Es una buena guia de veladoras novena pero no de solicitud de la asistencia de los diversos Santos."
4,"So far, so good","It is mid-November in northern Pennsylvania. We are waking up to air temps of 26 degrees for the past week. So far our 100 gallon pond containing 4 ""pet"" comets (my grandson named them) is staying a constant 44 degrees with the Climate Submersible working as it should. My hope is that it continues to keep at least part of the water unfrozen over winter. We shall see."
5,THE BEST COOKBOOK ON FILIPINO FOOD on Amazon. THE ONLY ONE YOU WILL NEED.,"This is the best cookbook on Philippine cuisine and the ONLY ONE that you will need. I was born in the Philippines and was raised by masters of Philippine cooking (from Pampanga) and I KNOW GOOD FILIPINO FOOD. Save your money, BUY THIS."
1,Loaded with inaccuracies,"I bought this book as a gift for my sister. We are both filipinas raised in the US and are deeply fond of our ethnic cuisine. As such, we were excited to try recipes in the book. We tried the chicken siopao recipe first. It was a disaster. The dough did not rise despite the fresh yeast. After the addition of the flour the dough was hard and unworkable. The seasonings for the chicken were too conservative. The filling should be slightly sweet. We had to doctor it up quite a bit.The Kutsinta recipe was a complete failure. It turned out thick and cakey rather than transulcent and gelatinous. It was also much too sweet.I would not recommend this book to any native filipino. If you are accustomed to the taste of the filipino cuisine, you will appreciate the deficiencies in the book."
1,Does not taste like chicken adobo at all,"I know how to cook some Filipino food already (from my dad's recipe). But my cooking is still different if you eat on a filipino restaurant. So I bought a cookbook. I cooked Adobo today and I felt like I wasted it. I followed the CHICKEN ADOBO on this book and it does not taste or look like adobo at all. I added some coconut milk for variation (page7) but certainly, it does not taste like ADOBO at all! Too sour. Typical adobo is brownish in color but this recipe is yellowish white (maybe because of coconut milk)but still even before I mixed the coco milk its not brown. Im so disappointed!"
5,Kuhn Rikon 13 1/2 inch easy-lock tongs,"This product is great for grilling and serving vegetables - I have had one for a long time, I recently purchased 4 more for gifts and one to take along to our new winter home in Florida. My husband uses it more than I do - he loves it for the grill. It washes easy and hasn't rusted or pitted at all yet."
5,"So beautiful, it brings tears to the eyes","I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. Unlike other romances I have read, this is genuine. Breeze and Lex share a true love, not like in the fairytales. Their love is shaken by hard times. I wish that I could find someone like Lex. Read this book. It will make you cry because the wording of this text is just beautiful. Just beautiful..."
5,"If Love Is Meant To Be, Nothing Can Stop It!","This is about a couple who meet as teenagers and go through the trials and tribulations. They are faced with deception, career choices, love lost and love found. The author did a fantastic performance in bringing us a story about Alexander (Also called, ""Lex"") and Breeze. A love so strong between two people that nothing actually kept them apart but they had some serious roads to travel. This is a fast-paced book with a very good storyline that you should enjoy. I enjoyed every chapter and hated to see it end. But all good books must end sooner or later. This was my first time reading a book by this author and look foward to reading more of her work."
3,Sweet Love Story,"Good read about two star crossed lovers who never seem to be able to get on the same page. Breeze and Lex both end up with the glamorous life, but their lives seem to be missing one significant piece - each other and the love they were denied as teenagers. If you love true romance and want to read a love story then this is the read for you. There are some interesting sub-plots with Breeze's sisters and parents as well that should hold your interest."
5,Better than Fried Green Tomatoes with the Ya Ya Sisterhood,"When it comes to the American novel of the ""sawth"" with women drawling out their best dialog, quips, and wisdom, this funny little novel has more storytelling power, plot, and dialog than most, and doesn't let its gals (2 white, 1 black)turn into stereotypes. It's as good, if not better than fried green tomatoes with the Ya Ya's, and both of those books are something wonderful indeed in their own right."
5,Great,I waited until I used this for one year before I reviewed it...it does a great job...great sound..comfy..and the volume adjustment is needed to lower the volume of the detector
5,They work!,"Used them for the first time last week. I'm so impressed. It really enhances the nuances you hear with a metal detector. A+! Yes, they're comfortable too!"
4,Look. It's a book from the 60's. Take it at that.,"I came across this book at a garage sale, and thought it looked fun. It was. It's a throwback from the 60's replete with such endearments such as baby, honey, and cream! It's not terribly deep, but it wasn't meant to be. I enjoyed it for what it was."
3,"george gershwin '""Rhapsody inBlue:""",Was disappointed that there were other tunes on the C.D. besides Rhapsody in Blue and An American In Paris. The rendition of Rhapsody was diappointing. i have heard better.
1,"Buy ""Golden Void 1969-1979"" instead...","This WAS a good CD to own before the ""Golden Void: 1969-1979"" compilation came out. Unfortunately for this album, all the great rare songs on here are now available at a better value on that compilation, along with several more songs and a long, interesting interview with Dave Brock. So guy buy ""Golden Void"", and leave this one alone."
5,please my mom,"fast deliver great price and what my 76 yr old mom was wanting we do karaoke when we have cook out, holidays, etcwonderful change of music"
1,Would be great if not censored.,"I bought this recording primarily to get a copy of ""Lawyers, Guns and Money"", for reasons I won't go into. I was more than disappointed to find that Asylum cut the last verse of that song, even though the complete lyrics appear in the liner notes. There is nothing on the cover that suggests editing of any kind. I'm sending it back as soon as I can figure out how. This is too bad because otherwise the collection is very good and features some songs not found elsewhere. I will not, however, accept a product that is misrepresented. Sorry Warren."
3,"Also disappointed that ""Lawyers..."" was edited","I liked all of the songs, with the exception of ""The Envoy"", which I don't think is very good. I am, however, like several others, severely disappointed that the ending of ""Lawyers, Guns and Money"" had been severed. I also bought the CD in order to listen to that song - especially the last line, which has been sung by Kevin Kline in the movie ""Grand Canyon"".Send Lawyers, Guns and Money The s**t has hit the fan(I don't want to offend any of the other customers.)"
3,Doubtful selections,"There are two one-disk collections of Zevon available on Amazon. I agree with Tim Brough below that if you get only one, you should go with 'Genius'. It has some excellent tracks - 'Carmelita', 'Reconsider Me', and 'Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead' - that were inexplicably left off of this set. The songs that you lose by picking up 'Genius' instead are mostly forgettable, although I wish 'Genius' had included 'Mohammed`s Radio' from AQNL, and both disks sadly excluded 'Transverse City', the terrific title track of an album that bombed commercially."
4,Army of skeletons,"this is the best single disk ""best of..."" zevon .....it is definitly ""top shelf"" Kwality."
1,A parody in the making,"Wow! This guy should have contracted with Saturday Night Live. Hokey, dorky, goofy, and banal...and I only listened to the clips. As a teenager in the eighties, I always hated that ""Werewolves in London""; still think it's a reeker. This album is a good tension breaker. You can't help but laugh at a guy who has a serious approach to this platter of spam."
3,"Skip This for ""Genius""","Warren Zevon is a lost American Treasure. Like John Prine and maybe Randy Newman, he understood that songs could also stand as separate literary structures. But since ""Genius"" contains his post Elektra/Asylum output and the uncensored version of ""Lawyers Guns and Money"" (the you-know-what does not hit the fan on ""AQNL""), ""Genius"" is the better buy. Of course, if you're feeling adventurous and have a few extra bucks, you should spring for ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead.""""Genius"" does trade off ""AQNL's"" ""Ain't That Pretty at All"" and the title track to the brilliant ""The Envoy."" Maybe someday that album and the live ""Stand In The Fire"" will make it to CD...."
2,I should have read this page first,"If I'd have known that ""Lawyers, Guns, & Money"" was edited, I wouldn't have bought this. Also, I think it's time to release an updated greatest hits with some of his more current tunes plus a more diverse selection of old ones. The tracks on this CD all sound fairly much the same, and it makes for pretty tedious listening."
3,Old but still handy,"This is an old volume and of course does not reflect recent scholarship; however, for grad students wishing a superb overview of the scholarship onthe revolutionary era in preparation for comps, it is well-worth the price!"
4,even better then the first ones!,Length:: 2:37 MinsGreat film the 3rd of the films and it only got better.
5,An unknown classic.,"Solar has remained under the radar for the duration of their career which is clearly a loss to music world. This is one of the best Rock en Español albums of the alternative style. It is a testament of pure shimmering guitar-rock, influenced by the 90' Britpop movement. This album is a precursor to many of the guitar-rock en Español bands that popped up during the early 2000's, specifically Jumbo, Volumen Zero, and Zoé. It is a classic of Latin Alternative rock that should be up there with Soda's 'Dynamo' and Los Planetas' ""Super 8."""
2,una buena intencion no lograda,"en los cd de esta epoca ( intermedia?) de la carrera de blades, en general, no se alcanza el nivel que mostro en sus trabajos anteriores, ni en los recientemente lanzados. la intencion de musicalizar a garcia marquez , con toda la libertad poetica que se pueda tomar, no dio como logro un cd de nivel. Obviamente Blades es un excelente compositor y aun siendo un trabajo regular, es un trabajo suyo, lo que asegura un nivel minimo que muchos no alcanzan nunca. Creo que es para admiradores fuertes de blades , a los que este les pueda gustar de cualquier forma. Yo lo compre y no es para nada un cd que sienta deseos de oir con alguna frecuencia. Hay mas musica de blades y latina que se puede adquirir este en mi modo de ver es obviable."
3,Good Choice,"This is the first edition of what was later known as ""Cronica de Dias Inutiles"" and the finish of the book is really third worldy, but the content is decent. Heralded as the Yucatecan ""Catcher in the Rye"" this book cronicles the misadventures of a group of 18somethings in a small conservative mexican city in the late 80's."
4,Childrens book,I bought this book as I thought it would help my vocabulary and it certainly has. The way the definitions are set out in sentences is also helpful to develop grammar. I am a mature adult returning to learning French after many years and I think this bright and colourful book would be handy for students of all ages. I often go through the book from cover to cover just refreshing my vocabulary.
4,Yeah It Rocks!,This is the only thing that wont brake or freeze in ice.( Never try freezing it in ice oops!)
4,"Great, and worth the time and money","I remember looking around on amazon and running across this cd - i own everything by linkin park so this seemed certainly interesting. I read the reviews, and what made my decision to purchase it were the above samples that you can play.I was not disappointed by the CD at all, as I found the instruments to be able to give LP's music an even more atmospheric sound that I thought was great. I found some of the timing of the notes a bit spotty at times (it seemed as though an intrument was a little off) but overall I am impressed with the talent of the players."
3,it could've been a lot better.,"i think that since they took the time to actually compose a strings tribute, they could've done a lot better. it's a decent cd, but i have a very keen ear...and in most of the songs, the strings are slightly off key. it got on my nerves after a while. if you're tone deaf and you like linkin park, then this is the cd for you. otherwise, download the piano versions of their songs instead. you can find them if you look hard enough."
1,pitiful ...,"wow ... I cant believe how dissapointed I was when I bought This CD !!! Out of the 5 ""String Quartet Tributes"" I own, (Evanescence, 3 Doors Down, Beyonce, Limp Bizkit, AND THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE !!!), this has got to be the WORST One of them all !!! Vibrato is WAY Mediocre, Pitch quality is DEPRESSING, and over all, the entire CD is COMPLETELY Dreadful ... Dont get me wrong, Linkin Park is a great band, but this, THIS, is just a disgrace ... See, I bought this after hearing their hit IN THE END, so I thought, why not give this a try ?!? But now, I wish I never had ... PLEASE Dont waste your money !!!"
5,LP Would Be Proud,"I am a total Linkin Park fan, and an ex-band nerd. To hear Linkin Park in a whole new way was totally mindblowing. Other than the mix up in tracks, they really know how to take hardcore music and make it sound beautiful, plus this cd along with the rest of my SQ collection helps me sleep. And seriously, anyone who considers this ""butchered"", some fan you are. This is truly an awesome addition to the LP collection."
4,It may not be perfect but its still amazeing,"While I was looking through for Linkin Park cds and music I came along this. While There are some things left to be disired it wasnt at all as bad as some of you make it sound. I think that the take on some of the most notable Linkin Park songs was fantastic and puts a new light on things. This may not be for the regular Linkin Park fan because its a different style and there are no vocals so those of you who love to hear Chester singing (yelling to some of you) will be disappointed. I on the other hand thought it was a nice change to the songs. While I know this String quartet has done other cds to some of my favorite bands, like Evanescence, I feel like they butchered the sounds on those I felt werent the way they were meant to be played. Im not saying buy all string quartet cds, but i am saying this is worth the money and would be good to any linkin park or string collection."
2,"Nice concept, but really out of tune!","I'm sorry, oh so sorry, for anyone who buys this. The quartet sounds REALLY out of tune."
3,"ok, but...","After listening to the previews of this album and previews of other String Quartet Tribute albums, it sounds to me that this quartet does put forth a great effort at recreating these popular songs. My biggest issue with these songs is that there is no real depth to the music, in the way that there was when Metallica recorded their S&M album with the San Francisco Symphony. Maybe if the quartet had a few more players, then their musical attempts would gain greater recognition."
1,Really horrible,I like Linkin Park but what these guys did was a discrace to the band. The band uses the cool beats but these guys used casual old school violin beats. That cd was just horrible good thing i heard it before i got it.
2,What were they thinking?,"I hardly call it a tribute. It's as it Linkin Park is already dead! They can make a tribute when they're long gone. The only reason I gave it two stars, is because it's a whole lot better then the country tribute I heard."
4,Its Good if you like celtic sort of thing,i have the album and i can honestly say that i was very impressed being a linkin park fan for so long and personally this is about the best tribute to them as i have herd others and they just didnt have that right sound and this doesSo buy the cd and you wont be disapointed
1,a huge dissapointment,i was really excited when i heard there was a quartet tribute to lincoln park. the idea is phenominal but this album is a disgrace. the songs are just uncoordinated reditions of LPs songs. this could really have worked if the quartet had used their initiative by using LPs songs as an inspirational base for the albums-basicly creating new versions of the original tracks. but what we are given is a shambles. mikes rapping does not sound right on a violin-its sounds stupid and pre-school. and at times it is even hard to hear what is being played. the quartet should have reviewed the lyrics and the ideas and made it into something magnificant.due to LPs popularity if this was done properly then the quartet would have a surefire hit.
2,Yeah right!,Uh I guess if you have nothing better to listen to...Really a novelty in my opinion...I would like to hear a symphony orchestra do it... :) with a little electric guitar thrown in for good measure...in the end was decent :)
4,great dvd player,"We love our RCA dvd player. Works great no problems. ***Guardian- I did not know we had to pay a fee to use the guardian features, that was not explained in the advertisement. That was the only part slightly bad about this purchase. The cost is $30 , so not really bad, but I just expected it to work right away. Great product."
4,DVD Player with TV Guardian,Kudos to RCA for offering an inexpensive DVD player to the public that makes it easy to blank out foul language. Based on reading the closed captioned script it works very well at silencing up to your chosen levels of tolerance in several categories. The only suggestion I would offer is that RCA make the remote control buttons larger. You will need your glasses to avoid hitting the adjoining button.How refreshing to no longer be subjected to Hollywood's inane foul language.
3,"good read, bad proofreading","This is one of Candace Hern's best books - an unusual hero, a strong heroine and humor. I took off some stars because of a lack of proofreading. It looks like it was sent through an optical character reader and then not even a spellchecker used on it. Many question marks litter the text where the OCR couldn't figure out what it was scanning. Several are in the first few pages, so a few minutes of checking should have alerted whoever processed this. For $5.99, I expect a more professional effort."
3,Fulfills an empty niche for San Fran Heads,"Though they were not the greatest band in the Bay area, the Aces played all over and with everyone. If you've studied the San Fran rock scene of the 60's, this cd will be welcome if only to have the opportunity to hear them. ""Afro Blue"" is outstanding and some of the garagey stuff is pretty good, but overall an average band."
2,Burned dvd?,"One of the discs dont work, and the episodes on the disc dont ""match"" with the actual ones. No menus on it or anything. Cant say i would recommend it to others, since it seems like they have just taken the whole season devided it into 1hr 45 min ""clips"" and burned it on a dvd."
5,Dokken at their finest hour!,"This album has to be, by far, the best album in the Dokken catalog. From track 1 to track 13 this album rocks. It also includes one of the most rocking instrumentals of all time, Mr. Scary. I would advise any old school rocker who was into Dokken or guitar based rock in general to pick this up. If you are a guitarist this is a must for your collection. Pick it up now. Back for the Attack will only make you smile in remembrance of the good ol' days of pop-metal."
5,George Lynch unleashed,"I remember when this tape first came out and it blew me away. Lynch's guitar work is awesome. In fact, I have never heard better. Don's vocals are good as always, but buy this one for the masterpiece guitar work. 12 years later and I still consider this the best studio album ever recorded."
5,"If you like '80 metal, you'll love Back for the Attack!","Dokken continues to evolve in ""Back for the Attack"". It's heavier than ""Under Lock and Key"", which was heavier than ""Tooth and Nail"". If you like metal, you'll love this one.Every song displays George Lynch's awsome guitar work (one of the best 80's guitarists IMHO). Regardless, this is a whole band effort and it's non-stop rock from beginning to end. It also has 13 tracks!! A double bonus as far as I'm concerned. This is my favorite 80's rock and roll album. It's unfortunate that Dokken gave up their rock roots in favor of whatever it is that ultimately killed most of the 80's rock bands. This album is the last of the real Dokken.Check out Mr. Scary, Standing in the Shadows, and Lost Behind the Wall. Heck, it's all first rate."
4,Driving Music enuff said!,If you have to make a long drive during the late evening or early morning hours this is the album for you. It rocks and rocks. Lynch is the best since Eddie Van Halen. Don't let anyone tell you this album is not worth buying. It is one of Dokken's best.
3,A disappointment when on the verge of stardom,"After establishing a sound in the albums leading up to this point, Back For The Attack, can only be called a disappointment.The tension in the band is clear as the style of music lacks fluidity. To be sure, there are highlights, especially the George Lynch masterpiece, Mr. Scary. But the opportunity to separate from the pop metal crowd of the 80's was lost.Recommended songs include: Kiss of Death, Prisoner, and Sleepless Nights."
1,Dream warriors is a Dokken master piece but,Other than the brillant song Dream Warriors the rest of the songs on this Cd are unlistenable. Try Under lock & Key for a good taste of Dokken.
1,I want to die,I found no pleasure in the CD. I kept asking myself.....why...why...why. And there were no answers. I found myself questioning life. I wanted to die. Music should be a good thing. This is not.
1,Hurry! Let's make another CD! In 60 Minutes!,"I think many people are just blind Dokken fans or George fans, I cannot believe there are so many 5 stars on this one? The songs sound like they were written as they were recorded. No depth at all, typical late 80's demise of Heavy Rock. All hot air and sounds like it was made for the band to cash in, or check out. Mr. Scary is about the only stand out here, and that is because there are no lyrics... which are aweful on this disc. This sounds lyrically like the type of stuff I wrote and rhymed in high school. Very amateur. And the production is terrible, again, typical late 80's reverb fluff, Mick has never sounded worse.This cd comes with ONE recommendation: BUY the new Jeff Pilson and George Lynch CD (****), now that has some quality songs on it, not mention a direction."
3,"Okay album, very inconsistent","Back For The Attack contains several strong tracks but is an inconsistent album and not as strong as earlier albums like Under Lock And Key and Tooth and Nail. The album starts out promising with ""Kiss Of Death"", one of their better harder tracks. The singles ""Burning Like A Flame"" and ""Dream Warriors"" are both very strong tracks. ""Sleepless Nights"", ""Heaven Sent"", and ""So Many Tears"" are also solid tracks. The strongest track by far is the instrumental ""Mr. Scary"", which shows George Lynch at his absolute best. There are also several tracks which are not up to par, particularly on the second half of the album. ""Standing In The Shadows"" sounds like a weak rewrite of their hit ""It's Not Love."" Other tracks such as ""Lost Behind The Wall"", ""Stop Fighting Love"", and ""Cry of the Gypsy"" are unmemorable and don't stand out."
3,Once again Dokken shows no ability to grow musically,"This is not a bad album, but it sounds like Under Lock and Key. I hate to agree with music critics, but overall they have always been correct about Dokken. They never really grew musically. While the other LA Metal bands stepped it up a bit..Motley Crue for instance......Dokken seemed satisfied with mediocre releases."
2,You keep wondering if the next song will be better...,"This CD has not a style. It begins fooling the buyer, because of his great cover art, which has nothing to do with the songs' lyrics, which talks, as ever, about love on the beach, etc, etc... ""Mr. Scary"" is the best track, an instrumental, showing the versatility of the musicians (Lynch the most brilliant, as ever!) I think it is a little better than ""Tooth and Nail""."
4,What music!,"This was a refreshing (and sorely needed in my opinion) change of pace from ""Under Lock and Key"" (album 3), which seem to categorize Dokken into the cream puff hair bands - including the campy outfits.Dokken was poetic as always and Lynch's guitar screams to be heard on this one. Definitely my favorite album from the band. Credit to Pilson and Brown too, for completing the piece and enigma that personified the great 80's experience of Dokken."
5,the best/the last,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is Dokken's best album. Period. It's perfect. The unfortunate thing is that every Dokken album that came out after this one ranged from mediocre to horrible. Yes, I have Erase the Slate and all the rest. What you have are a collection of albums that have one or two good songs on it and the rest is filler. Dokken lost their formula for making music that rocks despite the fact that he had giants such as Beach, Norum, and Sparks. I still listen to this album front to back. Remember when you could do that with Dokken albums and not want to fall asleep? This was their best. It should've been their last."
2,Reyli was much Better as Elefante,"I love Elefante, and honestly I expect more from their lead singer.This CD is mediocre at best. I couldn't even force myself to finish each song before fast forwarding to the next track.The only one I could listen to was ""Pegale a la pared,"" but only because I had heard it so many times on the radio and I knew the tune so well, not because it's a quality song. It's the 21st century. Do we really need to remind men not to hit women, but rather a wall. How about hit nothing, don't be such an emotional wreck that you have to hit something. Really guys, if you need Reyli to tell you that women are brave and deserve good men, then you're in trouble.Anyway, major disappointment. Not worth spending money on this CD. And, it is NOT rock en español. That would be an insult to the genre."
1,"JUNK, JUNK, AND MORE JUNK!!!","The first time I used the spade, IT BROKE!!! Considering the ground is not going to be soft all the time, the least they could do is make it sturdier. PIECE OF JUNK!!"
4,young and serious.,Here's Bragg at his most young an his most serious. Good thing he found a way to express his sense of humor over the years. I still love this album though.
1,Socialism Sells (Out),"What I like best about Billy Bragg is his wonderful, quirky sense of irony. While he croons on about his working class `identity,' social justice, and the wonders of multiculturalism, he is careful to live in a posh mansion in 100% rural White Dorset - as far as one can get socially and geographically from the multicultural chaos, confusion, and high crime of his native Barking.Well done, Billy, keep selling 'Socialism' and 'Multiculturalism' to Guardian readers and keep living the good life in nice, White, safe, upper class Dorset. No doubt Tony Blair will make you a Lord soon. Meanwhile all your fellow working class Whites who couldn't escape from the socialist multicultural chaos of Barking seem to have started voting for the 'far right' British Nationalist Party."
1,I-deas,Not as helpful as I thought it would be. Used it only once or twice for a couple things otherwise wasn't worth it.
2,Stick to commentating,I love Naseer Hussains commentary. I find him to be intelligent and well versed in the techniques of the game yet this book was not as good as it should have been. The writing is a little dry and he was not able to create the aura and mystique around himself and his team the same way Steve Waugh does it in his autobiography.
2,What hooks?!,"Let's just say Joe Pernice was treading water with this album. So much so that the best songs on this album would be the lesser ones on his other abums.The words ""dreamy"" and ""blissful"" are fleeting when listening to this bland album.Thankfully, Pernice rebounded with this year's vastly superior""Discover a Lovelier You"".Even the much vaunted Morrissey had his lulls."
3,3.5 stars - OK pop album,"I really don't know what the fuss is about. This is a solid pop album, but its not great. At the best moments I find myself thinking ""this is pretty good."" All the other times I think ""this is ok-but what else can I listen to.""Make no mistake these are well written songs, but none of them feel memorable, and the production is a bit sterile-sounding. The lonely sentimental sensitive guy aspect seems a bit contrived, but thats not my main complaint. Its just missing something, and it feels like there is nothing new here. Most of all it doesnt grab me. If I wanted to ""discover a lonelier me"" (I have the same complaints about that album) I would pull out Elliott Smith's self titled album."
3,forgettable,"here's what i said then: ""absolutely peerless pop from joe pernice, of scud mountain boys and chappaquiddick skyline, and big tobacco, and etc etc...this, i think, is their best outing yet, and you can expect to see it on year-end lists come december.""unfortunately, the damn thing had little to no staying power whatsoever. maybe the pop was a little too peerless. i burned myself a copy--which i never ever listen to--and sold it off. just goes to show, first impressions can be deceiving."
5,Joe Pernice Does It Again,"Joe and the ""Pernice Brothers"" have crafted another fantastic pop record that is sure to be among the best pop/rock albums released this year. If you like the truly all-time great pop songs, then you will surely appreciate Joe Pernice's writing and singing, Thom Monahan's production and the band's performance. Do American culture a small favor... BUY THIS NOW!!!"
4,"Not ""The World Won't End"" - Did it?","First, I love this band, and I've seen them live and they're even better and more impactful in a club venue - so go see them!!! As much as I love the music and the gifted writing, this most recent release has gone a bit off the introspective deep end, and I am left wanting the edginess, jangle, and energy of the prior release. I am left fearing we've seen an evolution from alt-country to powerpop to soft rock. All in all, this cd is a must have, if for no other reason than the continued strong lyrical content. Be prepared for some mellow listening, however, as there is no power in this pop."
4,No free shipping to APO,"The whole free shipping is a lie. I ended up paying $15 for a brush that's not worth more than $6.It's an ok brush, but the bristles keep falling off."
3,Lackluster.,"I'm pretty much a fan of any old WWF videos and matches. Allthough the matches are fun to watch because they are from the old age of WWF, I would not dare call them ""The Greatest"" WWF matches. Even for the very young WWF at the time of this video release, these matches just seem to be picked at random and released so WWF could make a quick buck. The video is only an hour long. If you are a serious video tape collector, then pick it up. If you are just curious like I was, ignore this and check out some of WWF's old ""WrestleFest"" videos."
4,This is an indestructible multi-tool,"This multi-tool is virtually indestructible. I have even used it in wet sandy saltwater conditions (crab fishing), and no rust or damage anywhere! I found that I needed to lubricate the blade axis in order to make the blades pull out easily, but that's about it. If you expect a tool to live up to expectations and last for many years, then you will not be disappointed. I bought my first one of these at a hardware store, but I am here at Amazon to pick up a couple more as gifts. It would be five stars in my opinion, but the blades are little tougher to pull than a Leatherman (not bad, though)."
3,Didn't love it,"Gambled on this one hoping it was a decent imitation of a Gerber. The tools joints are too tight and the blades have no real edge to them. The bit set was a nice incentive, but the adapter fits loosely on the tool and makes it awkward to work with. It'll do the trick if you have nothing else, but being a Victorinox/Gerber fan, I couldn't see myself holding on to it for long."
1,Item is not a gerber,"This product is not a gerber tool as the title and picture describe. It is ""Winchester"" brand and does not have the one hand opening."
5,An Absolute Must-Have for Concurrent Object-Oriented Design,Most Excellent! Doug Lea discusses concurrent OOD and OOPissues which I have found nowhere else. This book is amust-have for any OO designer/programmer intending to useconcurrent techniques. The principles and patterns presentedare applicable to implementation in any OO language.
5,Outstanding,"This is unquestionably the best text on concurrent and multi-threaded programming in Java. If you or your team are writing multithreaded software in Java (and this includes awt and swing applications as well as server side), you simply must take the time to study this book. CPJ matters just as much as the JLS or the JPL and you will be rewarded many times over for the investment. Newcomers to Java concurrent programming may want to start with Kramer & Magee's book first.Understanding Java concurrency requires one tostep outside the language proper: it's neccessary to stop pretendingthat Java is platform independent in order to write reliablemulti-threaded code. You will have to understand the Java memorymodel, how OSes manage threads natively and you will have to make theeffort to grasp some difficult material..."
1,Way over my head!,"I tried hard to understand the content of this book however,it made litte or no sense to me. I am a novice Java programmer but have several years of experience in other programming languages. Don't go for this book unless you're a very experienced with Java. Java consultants who work with me admit they understand only parts of this book....."
2,IQ test,"I agree with other reviewers that this book is hard to read and understand. To me this is more like an IQ test, if you are smart enough then you get it, otherwise, get lost and those who gave this book 5 starts will simply say: he does not understand a thing but the book is really great.So, all my fault, I should not buy this book at first and since I've bought it I should nod my head and say:""hmm, that's right, this is really a wonderful book.""I wonder why the author didn't write this book in Chinese."
2,Get the book on your hands,"Again;1) Get to a library and check out the book on your own.2) I hardly grasp the utility of the code (or in most cases pseudo-code) examples, and Yes! they would be good for a ""Java Mutithreading for dummies"" book.3) The book contains 236 (? ) references to scientific papers (In order to be objective, I took the time to count them)4) As you yourself admit resorting to language subtleties, this book is more about the philosophy of concurrency than Java concurrency and again there might be nothing wrong with the book, just its name.Good news is there are options with realistic - Java Multithreading - expositions out there; like Concurrency: State Medels & Java Programs, Jeff _, Jeff _, Jeff _, ISBN 0471987107, for example.Arthur"
1,"""This is Phylosophy of concurrency"".","This is not ""concurrent programming"".This is only ""philosophy of concurrency"".I think so too."
1,"Poorly Written, Poorly Organized","Writing a good programming book requires more than knowledge of your subject-- the would-be author must also know how to write. While Mr. Lea undoubtedly knows his subject, the resulting book is not only poorly written, but so unorganized its worthless as a reference. For example, endless numbers of variations on each type of Thread architecture are presented with little attention paid to the implications or potential for use in a particular situation. The result is the book reads more like ""all of the things I could think of about threads off the top of my head"" rather than a text meant to instruct the reader.For examples of a higher standard take a look at Programming with Threads, by Kleiman, Shah, and Smaalders, or Java Network Programming by Hughes, Hughes, Shoffner, and Winslow."
2,"It's a good book, but it may not be worth the effort",The other reviewers weren't kidding about this book being dense and difficult to read. The problem I have with it is not its difficulty but because most of it is cause by poor presentation and organization rather than the subject itself.
3,Extremely Theoritical,"This book mainly goes over the theory of Java Threads and works more as a guide to thread programming than a how-to book. Although the infomation inside the book is informative, more details regarding the thread classes and examples of their use is what is missing from this book. If one already know the java thread classes and wants better design in their programs, this is your book. If you are starting out and know nothing of threads or the thread classes, search elsewhere for help."
3,Too Theoretical,"The book contains a lot of concurrent and parallel programming theories, but the organization of the contents is not well formed, such that the reading and understanding of the book are hard. The examples giving in the book are not very helpful either.Overall, the book seems to target for academic researchers rather than developers. Highly recommend ""Java Concurrency In Practice"" which is much more practical and easier understood by Brian Goetz"
3,If you want to program concurency in Java you need this book,This is a kind of book you'll need to start developing concurrent systems in Java. It shows details of what should be done to safely handle patterns for concurrent programs.I beleive this book is a must for every developer who want to start learning concurrency design priciples for Java.
2,do not expect to get suspense,"Although Doug Lea works for Sun and built essential parts of the Java platform, this does not make him a good author. I had to get up to date with Java threading and bought this book. Mistake. From the computer science standpoint it is excellent, but as a typical project constrained programmer I found it absolutely boring. The author steps through the different chapters and subchapters as if he was trying to fill a ""this is all I know about threads"" list with life. No suspense, no ""I could use that"", no explaination of common pitfalls... I fell asleep a couple of times reading this book. Next to ""deadlocking"" Java threads can pose lots of other problems that this book does not cover. For instance threads and Swing or building an event dispatcher that works. A book that covers all that and that I hereby recommend is ""Taming Java Threads"" from Allen Holub. Two stars, ...it is solid but not useful..."
2,I just don't get it...,"I just don't understand how this book got all these 5 star reviews. I don't consider myself a beginner -- but I just could not read this book. It just jumps all over the place, using terms not in common practice, and not really building on anything.There were times I struggled to understand a concept only to realize that it was just something really simple. Other times, the topic ended just when it was getting interesting."
5,great clock and light weight,The clock is as ordered. It adjusted and reset itself at midnight. It is light weight and takes up just a narrow space on my desk.
4,"Lightweight, Accurate Clock","Automatically obtains accurate time. Just have to remember to set the correct time zone. By default, it's Eastern time. Display is easy to read and the temperature feature is a plus. Only thing is I wish there was a backlight, but that would probably drain the battery faster. Also looks stylish on our dresser."
1,"Nice clocks, when they work","but of the nine I ordered, only 3 worked, the others I could not set the time zone, as the control buttons would not work. I like the 3 that work, but the others suck IMHO"
2,It's Okay.,"I bought two to give as a gift, and was not happy with both because it's not easy to set and the direction are poor so I decided to keep them not give tham as gift because they will also have the same problem. After you spend hour or so playing with them they do work and hope the battery don't die."
2,Cheap goods,"As reviewers noted, the watch is only a watch and not a very attractive one at that. Nothing special except it keeps current time by consulting a source. The clock is a zany mystery. Who knows how it works ! Designed by a superior practical joker, perhaps versed in quantum mechanics."
2,dissapointed,"from the picture i was expecting for the clock to be kind of big a living room size type of clock, but instead i was quite dissapointed to find out it was very small."
2,No alam on this clock,You would think clocks come with alarm function. But there is no alarm on this clock.
2,Consider the Source,"The author may be a liberal Bush hater. He claims George Bush (the younger)is associated with INFAMOUS men - like Hitler. Had I been aware of the author's personal hatreds, I probably would have steered clear of the book. Given his flagrantly political, infamous, and UNTRUE statement I may have to be careful of the rest of the information in the book. I'm just saying...What the author did to a perhaps otherwise decent work was make it instant garbage with his foolish personal attack. He could have listed Mao, Che, The Dear Leaders, Stalin, and a host of other historical murdering miscreants. Naming Bush an infamous man and then dragging his mother into the page was a needless, thoughtless, immature, inaccurate, and outrageous personal insult. My hope is a work like this is not accepted as source material in schools or colleges. That would be a travesty."
3,A Funny Movie for the whole Family.,This was a funny movie when it came out and now I have it on dvd for something to watch when I want a simple laugh. There are movies like these that will never be super hits but they are fun to watch when you have a group of people around or what to see a small funny kid do adult things in a movie like playing a real cop. Remember this was a different time when movies like Home Alone were big and people wanted to make money off of that Idea. But as I said a funny movie for all.
2,A Missable Reynolds Movie,"Cop & A Half was one of the movie that continued the descent of Burt Reynolds' film career.This falls under ""the hard action crowd has deserted me so let me make a cute kid and a copy"" movie. But even though Reynolds knows how to be charming, and the kid has the requisite cute factor, the movie is not watchable or enjoyable on any level.Fortunately, Reynolds has made, and hopefully will in the future, make enough films that will help to blunt the impact of this stinker from moviegoers' minds."
3,The sets and the props were first class all the way!,Henry you got the right crew for the job. I just wish they didn't cut out your Fonz scene on the float in the parade that never was. See the movie as a child and you will truely love it. That is what was meant for.
1,poor burt,"poor burt reynolds just couldn't catch a break when this one was cooked up. it really is just sad to see the once mighty burt taking any job to make money! this tale of an 8 year old who sees a murder and uses this to get to ride with a real cop,burt(looking very unhappy and a little tired)is the man the boy gets. then they both set out to stop the killer. sound silly, you bet and not very funny. the pits"
1,THIS MOVIE ****!,"Easily Reynolds' worst movie. The plot isn't half bad, but the movie ****! What I don't get, is how in a way, it is a big hit. I am just so surprised that Burt Reynolds actually agreed to do this!!"
5,A film and a half!,"You have to question the judgement of reviewers such as Brooke 276 and Russell A Shiley who have given negative reviews to this classic piece of movie history. Perhaps they thought they were being funny giving negative reviews to an obviously excellent film? If the front cover, in which a small child is forcing the always excellent Burt Reynolds to wear some handcuffs as an amusing pair of comedy spectacles isn't funny enough in itself (it is) then nearly two hours of seeing why employing an 8 year old as a Los Angeles policeman would be a bad idea ought to be enough to convince even the most hardened cynic of the genius of this production. Go and buy this film now - you won't be disappointed!"
3,One of my Least Fav Phillips Book,Story is kinda dry and not much good humor. Characters were over the top... with my least favorite theme: make-overs. Not up to the usual Phillips par.
4,Go Gracie !!,"This is the cutest story and so funny, you will laugh out loud. Little Gracie Snow, a moral, upstanding kind of gal is given the assignment to keep ex-football pro turned movie star, Bobby Tom Denton in line. Neither her employer, Willow Craig, nor Bobby Tom himself make any part of this task simple. However, Gracie is a woman of her word and is determined to do whatever it takes to oversee the shenanigans of Bobby Tom. Lots of things go on from beginning to end, but it is a totally enjoyable ride. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I do not like how Gracie berates herself time and time again. There is no reason for her to feel inferior toward Bobby Tom and the constant reference to this was a turn-off to me. All in all ""Heaven, Texas"" is a great story."
2,Could have been better,"This was a quick read. This book started off interesting in the beginning and thin slacked off towards the end. Bobby Tom Denton was a total jerk and Gracie was too mousy for a 30 year old. I don't see why Bobby even loved Gracie and it wasn't believable that Gracie was SO in love with him after a couple of weeks of being around him. The whole book Bobby saw Gracie as just a good friend, not his type, and a good piece of ""you know what"" whenever he wanted some. Then at the end in a page he realizes he just loves Gracie sooo much. I skimmed through the last 3 or 4 chapters because the book was getting ridiculous for me. It was an okay read. I'm still a fan of SEP though."
4,Great Work as Always,"This book is as good as SEP's usual heart warming romances. The storyline, as always, is very original and the twists and turns leds one to almost believe evrything in this book is reality. Great work, SEP! Keep it up - and keep on writing!"
4,well written fun read,"I would have given this book 3.5 stars if I could. Although I love SEP's style, and LOVED Lady Be Good, I really didnt care very much for her books. I generally find her heroines to be snappy and irritating (however much she attempts to ""unglamorize them"" ) and usually end up feeling sorry for the heroes. I liked Heaven Texas even though it doesnt measure up to Lady be good. In fact, the secondary romance between Way and Suzy was very developed and didnt detract from the main story (I actually enjoyed reading about the secondary characters more than the main ones)."
4,Actually 3.5 stars,"I look forward to reading SEP's romances because they are well written, fun, and have great dialogue. I think this is the 4th book I've read by her and thus far it was my least favorite. Bobby Tom was just too full of himself and even though he was generous to his friends; he sure was clueless on how to treat the two women who meant the most to him (Gracie and his Mom). SEP did a good job showing how the ""golden boy"" sunk to a low point at the end of the novel, but the resolution was just too quick and easy. Although I liked ""It Had to be You"" much better, this is still a pretty good read."
4,"Heaven, Texas","A good read with some interesting plot turns. As a fan of SEP, I found it inline with her type of writing style. It is a good that I will continue to re-read."
3,"Good, but I was expecting more","This was the third SEP book I read, so I had a little bit of an idea of just what to expect. Like other SEP books, I found this story to be funny, entertaining, and unique - so why did I give it three stars only? Although I grew to like the character more, I thought the hero spent too much of the story being patronizing and derogatory to the heroine. It was a little difficult to believe that he was developing feelings for her at all when he spent so much time and energy being a pig toward her. While there were several moments that the hero was sympathetic, there were also many times where I didn't like him at all. I'm not sorry I read it, and I was entertained - I just thought some of SEP's other books did a better job of making the reader care about the characters."
5,OMG This book was great,This book was wonderful.susan elizabeth phillips did a wonderful with the charecters in this wonderful story. She made me feel everything gracie was feeling. with this book you will laugh and cry. i highley recommend this book. this was my first SEP book and it has me reaching for more
2,a disappointment from a great author,"This is my fourth SEP book, and I have been considering myself a fan of hers. Unfortunately this one is a disappointment. What I can not understand is the glowing customer reviews for Heaven, Texas. The relationship between Gracie and Bobby Tom is rather superficial and the nature of the main characters are slightly more than ridiculous. Bobby Tom and his life style is definetly kitsch! Although SEP had tried hard to make the readers believe his talents and intelligence, the result is somehow disappointment. On the other hand, personally, I liked to read the dialogs between Way Sawyer(the rich and the bad guy of the town) and Suzy (Bobby Tom's mother), their sizzling relationship was much more interesting. Hence, I must say that their part might have been a little bit extended.I highly recommend you to read Dream a little dream and Nobody's baby but mine from same author, you will not be disappointed if you prefer light, humorous, real love-romance."
3,"Not as good as ""It Had to be You""","It held my attention, and it was definitely sexy. But, the characters weren't all that well developed. I would have liked to have known more about them."
3,One of My Least Favorite SEP Books,"This book made me stop reading SEP for a bit, made me want to take a break from the same re-hashed plot. I really like her writing and her wit, but I didn't enjoy this book very much. I first stumbled upon SEP with ""Match Me If You Can"". I love that book, I think it's very funny. But after reading several SEP books in a row I felt like I had seen it all before... super studly superstud meets plain jane and treats her like dirt until he later realizes she's perfect for him. There were a couple of SEP books in a row where I found myself saying ""here we go again"".I think if you don't try to read all her books close together that won't be as much of a factor, however, this still would not be one of my favorites."
2,Lame heroine,"The main character, Gracie, was simply too lame for words..I found it boring & annoying to have a main female character that's sooo innocent, sweet, kind-hearted, etc, etc.. And a bloody virgin at 30+, to boot!!!C'mon!!! Let's get a bit more realistic.. I'd like to see a bit of flaws - and not just ""cute"" ones, either. More like real people..I have enjoyed SEP's other books, but this one & Nobody's Baby But Mine have been SO dull!The only reason I gave it TWO stars is because one of the sex scenes was good..But I think it involved the older lady (the guy's mom), not Gracie..For me, Sugar Beth Carey is still the best female lead - she's got a bit more personality..It was embarassing the way Gracie was mooning over the guy... (By the way, that must be the worst name ever: Bobby Tom!!! And, they are also too perfect, anyway! Boring!)"
2,predictable and stereotyped,"Based on reviews here I bought 3 books by this author, including Heaven, Texas. They were all ""easy reads"" but the plots were sadly alike, the characters the worst type of sterotypes... Generally this author seems to make her heroines virgins or the next closest thing, the men on the other hand have slept with thousands of women, but deep down they are ready to settle down. (Of course once the hero has sex with the heroine, he sees fireworks like he's never seen before, how pathetic!) Love seems to be all about giving up something, and the plots seem built on the worst type of teen fantasies about love and sex. If that is what you want OK. But a warning for those thinking of getting this book, due to links like ""people who bought this book also bought""... On the back cover the author is quoted saying she wished the whole world was like romance novels. If she means her's I find this a SCARY THOUGHT!"
1,read this book-if you don't have anything better to do...,"Here's the thing...This book is no different from any other romantic literature. The characters have no depth. The story line is weak and predictable, and honestly I am listening to this book on CD to pass the time and to have some background noise to make my day go by faster.I don't mean to be harsh, but I think that authors should be held accountable for their work.This is not her best work, and what makes it sad is that it could have been.Hopeless romantics, women who like predicatable story book endings and sex scenes will love this book, and while I am known to be a romantic, I like stories that actually have some depth to them."
1,DO NOT BUY KINDLE FOR THIS:TROJAN,Do not get the kindle version of his book from Amazon. It came complete with a Trojan.
4,OK for purpose,My prostate oncologist prescribed at least 20 mg of lycopene every day. This product fills the bill at reasonable cost.
4,sounds cool,"it was pretty cool, but I didn't know it was as short as it is. i love classical music though, so it was worth it in my mind"
3,une cay-day,"the CD is great but u know what 4 songs or whatever is NOT worth 18$! aren't all these songs on the other CD? if so, wouldn't you rather get 110 songs more for 3 times that price?"
1,Emiko Shiratori's voice is going to waste,"You don't become a proffessional vocalist unless your voice is only a few steps removed from divine, or you're going on some weird Broadway show where they need bad accents and such. Therefore, I cannot blame the horror that is Melodies of Life on Emiko Shiratori, though it pains me greatly to blame Nobuo Uematsu, whom I hold in the highest regard. But this music is absolutely terrible. Ms. Shiratori's English coach was likely drunk, which is why her english is half the time slang, yet still rings with the perfection that only foreigners can achieve. Furthermore, the melody goes nowhere: no climaxes, no variation, nothing, not so much as a crescendo. Rather it adorns itself with meaningless and poorly placed ornamentation. For the love of god buy FF Pray instead."
3,"For the price, it shouldn't have flaws","When I pulled it out of the box I first thought ""cool"". After a closer look it was clear that the molded plastic part of the hammer around the metal parts wasn't as cleanly finished as it could/should be. Since these BP Dead Blows aren't cheap, I expect them to be finished nicely. I have the 16, 24, 32, and 40. The 40 is the only one that was finished right. All four work perfectly. The 40 is a little heavy to swing and won't likely get used much unless Something really needs persuasion. all in all, a nice addition to the toolbox."
4,A Good Deal,"If you want to start a watch collection, this is the watch.If you want to know what the low cost, good quality, of Invicta is about, this is the watch.Guy or gal can easily wear this. The size is not huge and the colors allow for either gender to enjoy it.I have over 200 watches, and over 100 Invicta watches, so this is one of my ""Kick Around Watches"".You can't beat the quality for the price!"
5,TCM cures,this is for the person who is tired of western medicine. the herbal remidies are really helpful
4,Good Book,Its amazing how many natural cures there are... I love this book. As a massage therapist its always good to have around...
2,"Disappointing after ""Wishes...""","I was eager to get Jess Klein's latest album because ""Wishes Well Disguised"" has been one of my top 3 favorite CD's since it came out, staying in my CD player for weeks at a time. Unfortunately, I've found ""Draw Them Near"" to be a disappointing follow up. After the strong vocals and emotional impact of songs such as ""Strong Enough"" and ""Soldier"" (2 of my favorites from ""Wishes...""), most of ""Draw Them Near""'s tracks seem like mere filler...heavy on the pop-style repetition of vaguely-meaningful ""this-sounds-really-deep"" refrains, light on the actual depth."
4,Very good album,"I had never heard of Jess Klein before I aquired this album, so I had no idea what kind of music or songs to expect. But from the very first opening notes I knew that I would like it. She has a very nice voice, and the songs are all good. I particularly like ""Little White Dove"" but they are all easy to listen to. It makes me wonder why I have never heard her on the radio here in Canada. She certainly deserves to be known, if this album is anything to go by. Booklet includes all lyrics and a couple of photos."
5,Love it!,This CD is great for an emotional girl's nite in. Listening to Jess makes you feel like your with a friend. You just need to listen.
4,Folky,"I found this cd to learn more towards folk. There were a few popish tunes, but interesting for the most part. This was the first time I had actually listened to Jess and have been quite pleased with it. Worth a listen."
5,A truth that hits home,This book is a great insight to what the Catholic Church teaches. It also gives great examples and explanations to how to keep the Ten Commandments in our everyday lives. This is a must read for all Catholics.
2,A poor attempt to write about a fascinating man,"This book was not what I was expecting. I am quite fond of Dee and consider him to be a highly interesting individual. However, I feel this book misses the mark. The author knows a lot about Dee, but goes about it in the most haphazard way. The writing style leaves much to be desired. It is choppy and hard to follow. The chapters range from just 2 pages to many. If the book were edited properly, it would be worth your time."
2,The Mammoth Book of Sorcerers' Tales,I am disappointed in this book. I have read 10 of the stories so far. Each story starts off great and builds into something exciting. Then each one seems to end abruptly. So my problem is with the endings. Each one is worst then the one before.I would not recommend this book to someone who is starting to read fantasy. It will disappoint them
2,"too thick, too yellow","I had two types of projects, a digital photo album and some trifold flyers for my business. I tried two types of double-sided paper for my inkjet printer. This paper gave a faint yellow tinge to my photos, and is too thick for my flyers. For both uses, printworks photo project paper looks better. The latter is a bit shinier than the epson, which might be a downside for some projects."
3,OK Paper for Invitations/Postcards,"This paper is not for archival picture printing. Best for presentations, invitations, postcards, etc., anything you don't want to keep around for many years. Definitely not for scrapbooking or photo albums. Paper quality is good though. Feels substantial and printing is fine."
2,"""ITS JUST CARD STOCK"" - U-GO-will-e....!","I AM USING Margarito Espinoza Jr. ""will-e"" REVIEW, IT'S ""PERFECT....!Ok, I got this thinking it was going to be quality Matte Photo paper, but I really don't see the difference from regular card stock. I compared the 2, one of which I purchased a ream at wal mart for half the price of this. Very disappointed in the print quality as well. Images look so much more vivid and bolder on regular paper than this. Don't waste your money. Its just card stock.NOT MORE THAN PLAIN PAPER AT A HIGH COST $$$$...! I WILL BE SENDING IT BACK...!U-GO-WILL-E.....!"
5,Great Value,"Wonderful matte paper and quite the price for so many sheets. Once again, buy a couple of packs and you get free shipping and it's so much cheaper than any store I have found. Just remember, it's MATTE finish, not glossy. I prefer the Matte look and am reprinting tons of old photos and sharing with the entire family. Great buy!"
2,Disappointed,"I've used this paper for years and been happy with it. But when the shipment came in from Amazon this time, I immediately noticed it was no longer ""photo"" paper. It is now presentation paper. I'm not sure if it is the same product, but it appears Epson has downgraded it, which makes me wonder if it is no longer good for long-term photo use. There's no mention of that use on the new packaging."
2,"Product I expected, but warped","I've used this paper millions of times over the years, and what I received was the correct product, but this is the first time it's arrived warped - it's vertically curving, and the prints never lie flat. Which is a major disappointment."
4,evaluating matte paper,The explanation of how to use the paper was priceless. THE END PRODUCT AFTER USING THE PAPER -I give 3 and 1/2 stars.
5,Great Paper,I am currently working on my architecture portfolio to send out to potential employers and this paper is the only one that I will use. It is amazing how much clearer the prints turn out than that of regular card stock. The colors also turn out more accurate than HP's brochere paper. It is not to stiff either... yet thick enough to score without allowing the blade to penetrate through the paper. Transparency not a issue unless you hold it up to the light.
5,"Mobile base for 14"" bandsaw",I find that this base is sufficient for my Powermatic band saw. It moves around in the shop with ease
3,"Not HTC, but works ok","This is not the HTC as advertised, and although mostly the same is not the same quality in many regards as my other HTC 1000s. On the plus side, it does work and it isn't too expensive -- all in all, a good value. I just wish they would sell what they advertise, hence the 3 stars instead of 4."
5,great addition,great addition for my band saw to move around the shop. Very sturdy and easy to set up and the price was right with fast shipping.
4,HTC PortaMate PM1000 Universal Mobile Base,"This base went together in about an hour or so.The directions are adequate,but just a little vague.It served the purpose well for my application.I used it to mobilize my scroll saw.I would recommend this mobile base to anyone who wants good mobility at an affordable price."
5,Worshipper/PrayerMom,"I love this album. I can feel the presence of God when I listen to it. ""Highest Praise"", ""Right Place"", and ""Thank You"" are songs that feed my soul. If you really enjoy vasting in the presence of God I recommend you buy this album. It's more than just the music, the words say things that I want to say to my Savior each day, if you don't know what to say or what to pray I recommend that you listen to ""Thank You"" and when you just want to worship, I recommend the ""Highest Praise"". The entire album is awesome even the Jazz inspired tune ""We Have Come"". God Bless you Pastor R. McKissick Jr. and continue to let the Lord use you. The anointing is flowing from the head to the beard, to the members of your choir, believe me, let there be no doubt in your mind THIS IS KINGDOM BUILDING MUSIC."
3,I like a few songs here,The first half of this CD is good but the second half has not yet grown on me if it ever will. I like the quality of musicianship. Our church choir sings some songs from the first half.
4,A book to begin your life with,"I looked at all kinds of material written by so-called sages, spirits giving after-life teachings and have yet to find anything quite like this. It is fresh though a little short and it somehow seems to feel different every time I pick it up to read. I find something new with each reading of it. It isn't difficult to read either, it only has 80 pages from beginning to end and can be read all at one go but I think that to really get the point of it, you need to look further into what each piece is saying to gain the fullest benefit from it. I found some interesting slants on what we are and why we exist wihout making me feel inadequate for not knowing and also, if it was a little over-simplified in places, it made me feel unhurried, relaxed but informed. I have heard their radio programs too, so you can hear the Gregory material come alive.I bought a copy for my mum too to bring her some peace in her life so she won't be so full of fear."
5,Best Garlic Press Ever,I have had this press for almost 3 months and I am always looking for a reason to use it. Very easy to press even the largest of cloves and does a very complete job of it. A bit pricey but worth every penny.
5,The Only Garlic Press You'll EVER Need!,"This garlic press is the real deal - worth every penny! It's made of high quality materials, it's sturdy, super heavy duty, and presses the garlic with such ease! It's effortless, even for my tiny little hands! My favorite part about this garlic press is how easy it is to clean - again, 100% effortless!I've never written a review on a product before, but I purchased this product for myself last year and love it so much I'm buying another one as a gift for my Mom, and she doesn't fool around in the kitchen (cookin' is serious business)!The bottom line is, if you use a lot of fresh garlic, this is an absolute ""must have"" kitchen tool - you won't be disappointed! I'm sure it'll be the last garlic press I ever have to buy, and I'm okay with that! Kudos to Kuhn Rikon!"
4,"First one I got broke, replacement has been good.","I requested this press for my birthday on the strength of the Cooks Illustrated review. It came (from Amazon) the other day, and it looks great.HOWEVER, when it came time to use it for the first time, I put in one clove, started to crush, and the press just broke in my hand! The short pin that forms one side of the top handle hinge broke away from the body. No garlic even made it through the seive!Since everyone seems to love this press, I'm willing to chalk it up to bad luck and give it another try. I'll be calling the company today to see about getting it replaced, and will update my review accordingly.UPDATE (2011): I called the company, explained what had happened, and a few weeks later received a replacement. We've been using it ever since (three years now) with no issues. It works fine. Easy enough to squeeze, easy enough to clean. Nothing revolutionary."
2,Not as good as the earlier model.,I regret buying this ergonomic style. I have pinched my fingers more than a few times. I regret that I didn't buy the old style again.
4,Durable design for strong hands,"I have owned countless garlic presses that have ended up broken within one year of use. All of my broken presses share a design similar to the Zyliss presses (among others). These presses boast a simple, traditional press design and the best ones have a good fit and finish.But, in each case, I have ended up breaking out the perforated press area. When reading reviews for both the Rosle and Kuhn Rikon presses, I noticed a fundamentally different design, with a much stronger design for the perforated press area. On inspection, you find the Kuhn Rikon press offers a much stronger steel material for the perforated press area than many other presses offer. This is possible due to the ingenious double-swivel design.I can give the design 4 stars as I have not used the press for more than two months. So far, so good and I would give it five stars once I see this press perform for over one year."
2,Overbuilt,"This garlic press is way over-engineered. It is very heavy with lots of moving parts. Lots of moving parts means lots more cleaning as garlic squirts everywhere into all those hinges and gaps. In a nutshell, this press is expensive and totally unnecessary.I much prefer my old aluminum Zyliss Susi press. Yes, the finish is flaking off. It's easier to clean by virtue of being a far simpler design.I don't know what possessed me to buy this thing."
3,only the truth,"This is definately of great quality, but ergonomically speaking, I've had better ones. Also,I don't find it easy to clean. It does crush garlic well though."
3,Unnecessary kitchen tool.,"I've always wanted a garlic press, although I'm not sure why as I have always been using my trusty Global Chefs knife to mince garlic. When I saw this on a sale, I immediately bought it and when I first used it, I really hated it because it was hard to clean (compared to just a cleaning a knife blade), and a lot of garlic was wasted in the crevices of the device. The second time I used it, it was okay. But it doesn't get much use in my kitchen because I rarely ever remember to reach for it during cooking... so it is just sitting in the drawers until I do remember to use it. Overall, I'm not very impressed with this, and it certainly wasn't the best $26 I've spent. I don't think this tool is a must-have for any kitchen unless you don't really know how to use a knife."
5,Best press hands down,"Pros:Handles garlic like butter; almost no strain to get garlic throughAlmost nothing left if the device after a pressSUPER easy to clean. All the part flop out allowing you to use almost any means to clean itCons:Little big for people with small handsUp front priceI eat a lot of garlic, but have always hated messing around with it, and then cleaning the press... Mostly I disliked the idea of standing around trying to build up my forearms by hammering a toe of garlic through other various presses for family events et al.Then my uncle bought this thing for my mom, and I had a chance to use it at a family event and had to get through 3 toes of garlic. It took me about as long as half a toe normally did. Then cleaning up after dinner, it was no harder than cleaning any other dish. No toothpicks :)Needless to say, I bought my own, and now poke fun at my uncle for how much he spent on his."
2,"Watch out, or you will get a serious pinch","This garlic press has a lot going for it. It's strong and easy-to-clean. But the design is flawed in that one arm overlaps the other. When you're squeezing hard to close it, if your hand is cradled too closely around the arms, your skin will get caught when the top arm closes over the lower arm, resulting in a serious pinch."
2,Screeching Sound,decent garlic press except for one thing: it makes a loud metal screeching sound everytime you rotate it open.
3,"Product just fine, took over a month to recieve","I had ordered the garlic press as a gift for Mother's Day, it didn't arrive until after Father's Day. Shortly after placing the order I was informed that the product had shipped. 10 days later, after contacting the seller, I was told the product had never shipped and in fact was not even in stock at their wherehouse. I was also informed at that time that it would ship no later than June 10th via priority mail (2-3 day delivery). 8 days later I had to contact the seller again as the product had still not arrived. At that time I was provided a tracking number for the shipment and it arrived the following day. I have no complaints about the actual product, it works great and is exactly as advertized. However, thanks to the delays, I have a mother who is utterly unimpressed by my attempt to find her a top notch kitchen utensil."
5,Easy to use,"From other reviews I was concerned it may be difficult to squeeze the garlic press closed, but I've had no problems so far, but I peel the garlic first. I did try it with the skin on and 2 cloves at once and that did make it harder to press. It's very easy to clean. I love the fact that it's stainless steel and easy to clean."
4,industrial strength awesome,"I've had this Epicurean garlic press for many years. It's heavy and with good reason - it gets the job done right, the first time. I have really bad arthritis with joint replacements in my hands so I need to use both hands with this tool but the curved handle makes that seem almost intuitive. I love that I can save a step and not peel the garlic. The swing out pressing plate makes it soooo much easier to clean than presses I've owned in the past.Yes, it is expensive but in all these years I've never regretted this purchase and I expect this tool will last a lifetime. Highly recommended."
5,WONDERFUL,"Fantastic! easily the best garlic press my girlfriend or I have ever used. Extremely well made and easy to clean.Tip: Use the 3 for 4 promotion with this and some other kitchen stuff you've been wanting, it really helps make a $34 garlic press seem worth it!"
4,"Good, not great!","Though costly and well made, the ""basket"" on this device is rather small, permitting only 1 medium clove to be pressed at a time. The extruded garlic must be scraped from the outside, which is true for most presses of this type. Cleaning? Not difficult, although some care must be taken, since the components tend to flop around a bit when the handles are opened. The handles are well shaped to allow pressure to be applied and the leverage provided makes pressing quite easy. One wonders, however, if the relatively high price is merited."
5,very impressed,"was influenced by the amazing reviews but was at first a bit hesitant to buy due to price.. eventually brought it and was completely blown away by how good this is... definitely worth the money... very well made, easy to clean and almost none of the garlic goes to waste... very happy:)"
5,Great Garlic Press,It's good quality. Great design. Easy to use and clean. Give me the right texture of garlic. Happy that I got the right items.
2,Hard to clean,I've had this press for about 6 months and compared to the other presses I've owned it doesn't measure up. And that's because its very hard to clean. Other presses allow you to reverse the pressing action and clean out the left over garlic. This press has to be cleaned by pulling out all that's left and that can be very messy. It's well built but I'm going to look for something else.
3,"Nice looking, but wobbly/sloppy fitting","I saw ""Swiss"" so I was expecting not only a product that was good looking, but also put together with tight tolerances. It is not!The sides of the arm which comes down and presses the garlic flare up. That gives the whole assembly about 1/16"" of play -- with the noises and sloppy feel that comes with that. IMO this is the difference between a product that is ""good enough to make a buck"" versus something that one would be ""proud in manufacturing"". And it all because the sides of that arm flaring up.3 stars for the disappointment and wasted potential."
1,"Great while it lasted, but broke.","Thought I had found the ultimate garlic press. One that could take it in the kitchen. But after about 50 pressings, the top part broke free of the bottom. I tried to press it back on but it wouldn't go. I threw it away...very unhappy at Kuhn Rikon who made my wonderful pressure cookers. Then I ran into big green Prepara press. WOW. It takes up to six large cloves at a time...actually more. I has never failed in about 6 months. It cleans very quickly and asks for more. I would not buy another Kuhn Rikon kitchen tool, although the pressure cooker still works (I did need a replacement rubber seal after a while)."
1,Overrated,"What a disappointment. Too much loss of garlic leaking out the front of the unit. Made in China, looks great, although does not fit together very well. I'll go back to the Zyliss I previously used that lasted over 15 years."
3,Kuhn Rikon garlic press works great but is messy,"We found this garlic press to be messy. We read other reviews before buying and they mentioned the messiness, too, but we still were curious enough to pay the $35 for the press. The quality is outstanding and extremely well made, fits great in your hand and doesn't require huge pressure to press the garlic well. But once the garlic is pressed, you are left with picking out the grate with your fingers. We bought another for $5 at a culinary store that works just as well...but may not last as long as the Kuhn Rikon. Your call."
5,A great purchase!,"The price of this garlic press caused me to hesitate before purchasing, but the reviews were so good I went ahead and bought it. This is hands-down the best garlic press I have ever used; it is absolutely worth the price. The chamber is only large enough to handle one clove at a time, however the claims are true, you can put it in unpeeled (just cut off the hard, dry base), and only the papery skin will remain in the chamber after it is pressed! The garlic comes out in the finest, even mince I have ever seen. Our garlic consumption has more than doubled since purchasing this press, since we enjoy using it so much! Cleaning is a breeze too. Highly recommend!"
5,It's all in the finish...,"The ""secret"" to this press is that it's plated with a very high quality surface that is easy to clean, won't discolor your garlic mince, and needs a lower effort to work. Unplated ""raw aluminum"" presses take more effort and discolor your garlic, and the insides get icky. Buy this one and be happy."
5,Best design yet,I have gone through several of these and this is by far the best one I have owned. I am considering buying one as a spare.
3,Made in China,"I just received this garlic press, so I have not had a chance to use it. However, I was very disappointed to see a ""Made in China"" sticker on an item that is supposed to be made in Switzerland."
3,"""Swiss made"" ? Really?","The Kuhn Rikon garlic press seems to work fine and well it should considering the hefty price. But I couldn't help savoring the strong smell of irony that accompanied the pungent aroma of garlic that wafted through my kitchen.The Swiss Cross national emblem is prominently embedded on the press itself and again via a little cardboard ""flag"" attached by a string to the product. I suppose the redundancy is designed to drive home where the product was ostensibly manufactured and to tout the fine workmanship I guess.But more revealing was the decal affixed to one of squeeze handles:ITEM NO. 2315PLU CODE 0547502315and the kicker...MADE IN CHINA!!!It appears that Uncle Sam isn't the only country these days where home grown craftsmanship once was held in high esteem...but no more."
2,The Most Expensive Garlic Press,"I have wanted this garlic press for several years. I used it one time and it is heavy, hard to press the handle and a pain in the something-or other to get the minced garlic out of it and also to clean it. I do not have small hands. I wear I size 8 bracelet and am large boned so I didn't think using would be a problem but wow, it was awful to squeeze. Just my opinion, I usually love all the Kuhn Rikon products and lusted after this one for 3-4 years and finally decided to get it. I will just use my old one made by Amco!"
5,great garlic press,"I had heard about the garlic press from an article in ""Cook's"".. It was rated the best.. I have to agree.. It is very easy to clean, the handles fit into the hand very comfortably. It really is easy to use.. I have had a few presses over the years.. This is by far the best one that I have used.."
5,Kuhn Rikon Garlic Press - Nicely Engineered,"I've had this press a couple of weeks, and it's been a joy to use, and a joy to clean, the working parts flip out of the handle and separate so they can be rinsed quickly. Nicely engineered alternative to my previous presses that took way more work to keep the passages open."
5,Best garlic press I've ever owned,I purchased a Kuhn Rikeon Epicurean Garlic press after reviewing several presses. This one seemed to be easy to use and clean. The garlic presses that I have purchased previously have been difficult to clean. I was very pleased when the press arrived as it was very easy to use and clean. I thrilled with this purchase as I use garlic frequently and this makes it so much easier.
5,Wonderful Kitchen Utensil,"The Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press is a wonderful kitchen utensil. It is well worth it's price. It does an excellent job and cleans up wonderfully in the dishwasher. Of all the garlic presses I have used in the past, this is the one I highly recommend!"
5,Pricey but the best I have seen,It works excellent. My parents had bought one so I knew what I was getting otherwise I would have had a hard time paying so much for it.
5,the best,"It's the press you can place unpeeled cloves within... and it just works fantastically well. The head swings out, and cleaning is easy. Worth the price."
5,Great,"I highly recommend this product, it's worth the price. It's very easy to use and clean. It has a solid construction and I believe it will last very long time."
5,great press! Easy to use!,"If you really want to get the juice out of your garlic this is a great press! It is easy to use and does not require a lot of force to get the garlic finely smashed. Pressing the garlic and finely chopping it gives a different outcome. For cooking soup and some stir-fry dishes, i think this is a great tool. For garlic mixed with other sauce, the garlic juice will distort the texture."
5,Works super-well and is really easy to clean,"I was dubious as to whether I should pay $35 for a garlic press. I'm so glad I did! This press shoots minced garlic into the pan, and all you have to do is load in an unpeeled clove and squeeze (hard). It's also really easy to clean. Great buy! I've used it a lot."
5,Easy to use,"I like the consistencies of each garlic clove that is pressed,Easy to clean.I would recommend this to any one that has a hard time gripping."
3,Not impressed!,"It looks good and it feels solid but the handle is too big for my small hands. I find my finger getting caught between the handles and it's quite heavy for a garlic press. I also think it's overpriced since it is Made in China. As you can see, I am not happy about it so I am sending it back. I don't want anymore made in china products in my kitchen. I found a Wusthof garlic press that is made in Germany and it's much cheaper."
2,Made in China,"This is a $34 ""Swiss"" tool, yet the sticker on it plainly says Made in China. My Kuhn Rikon pressure cookers were made in Switzerland. I had no reason to believe that this press was not made in Switzerland. SO disappointing. The design of this press is very good. It's unfortunate that Kuhn Rikon outsourced production to China. I try avoid Chinese manufactured goods when purchasing kitchen products. It would be nice if Amazon listed where a product is made. If Amazon listed this as made in China, I would not have purchased it. If I wanted a Chinese garlic press I could have just gone to Walmart and saved $25."
2,MADE IN CHINA,"This is a great garlic press, but given its cost I'd have expected it to have been manufactured in a country with fair labor and human rights practices.It may be by a Swiss company, but don't be fooled, it is MADE IN CHINA!Last Kuhn Rikon item I buy until they move their manufacturing elsewhere!"
2,"Great press, but made in China.","This review is for those who care about human rights violations in China. The garlic press is designed and sold by a Kuhn Rikon, a Swiss company. However, the press is actually manufactured in China.It works well, and does not take a lot of hand strength to press two cloves. Nice all-stainless steel construction. Clean up is a breeze because the press design opens wide and allows easy access to all parts."
3,Bad packaging,"For an expensive garlic press, I expected some fancy packaging, but this came in a plastic bag!! It is supposed to have lifetime warranty, but no cards or inserts of any sort. It almost seems like Amazon shipped a refurbished item or something! It did have a sticker on it with brand name and ""Made in China"" with barcode."
3,Just OK,"We bought this item after seeing the review on America's Test Kitchen. We noticed, as they did, that the finish on our Zyliss press (which we love) was flaking off. The price seemed a little high, but it looked like a solid piece of equipment that would last for years.The build quality of the Kuhn Rikon seems great - this is one heavy duty garlic press. It is super easy to clean - both in between cloves and once you're all done. As with the Zyliss, you can press garlic without peeling the wrapper off.All that being said, I'm not going to be keeping this one. It does not press as nicely as the Zyliss - the garlic goes everywhere. I've also pinched the palm my hand in it a few times when squeezing too hard (to compensate for the poor pressing). It hurts bad!After using many different garlic presses, I can say that this is better than most, but I'll be going back to the Zyliss - even if I have to replace it every few years."
3,Beautiful but not the most functional,"When I read about this product in Cooks Illustrated I had to purchase one. I will be brief in my review. I am an avid home cook, and have been happy with my sussi zyliss garlic press for years. The Kuhn Rikon is beautifully made, it has great leverage. The area that holds the garlic is too small to handle certain cloves of garlic. There are seams on it where the garlic can escape from when being crushed. The worst design flaw is that it almost always pinches my hand while crushing. That being said, the clean up is easy, and it's a kitchen gadget that is built to last. I do think it is way overpriced, and would say if you already own a zyliss, stick with it."
5,ImPRESSive!,"I saw a review of this garlic press on America's Test Kitchen (PBS )and basically they said that itis a bit pricey but worth it. Boy, are they right! They should call this the Garlic EZPress because you can popyour unpeeled clove in the hopper, easily close the comfortable handle, and out pops the garlic leaving nothing but peel inthe super easy to clean hopper. It is difficult to explain how good this press feels in your hand. I am one of those who does not have a lot of hand strength and so I have struggled with standard garlic presses. I was so excited the first time I used this garlic press that I made everyone in my family try it just to show them how cool it is. I wanted to press garlic all day! Guess what all the cooks in my family are getting for Christmas."
4,Designed in Switzerland? Made in China.,"Nice design and extremely heavy-duty construction. In case it matters to you, note that this item is made in China despite its Swiss branding."
3,Just another garlic press,"This press is nothing special. Seems well built, but still hard to clean. Cloves must be skinned to work well. Let's find some gaget that removes the skin and is easy to clean. I will say the garlic is a great size to work with when it is pressed. Drop the price by $8 and it would be worth buying another item made in China."
2,Good - But with Important Caveat. Use Gloves to avoid bloody skin pinches.,"This is a well made and very durable hand press for garlic and ginger. BUT BEWARE! The handle can and will severely pinch your skin. I found I needed to wear light leather gloves to avoid getting my skin pinched between the body and handle of the tool. My wife had the same problem and got pinched badly also. CONCLUSION! Its a good tool as long as you are aware of and take serious precautions against what could be a painful, bloody skin pinch. If it is re-engineered to prevent skin pinching it would be a great tool."
4,Done the job,"I have had my Filigree set for 12 years now. It is rather sturdy considering I now have three children that are 7 (twins) and 8. It is not chip resistant nor unbreakable like Corelle so if that is what you are looking for, buy Corelle. Also if you have had Corelle in the past, these plates and bowls take up more room. I have a few pieces with chips, but they were rather hard hits to get them to chip. It does show some silver/gray marks from silverware. I am careful what I place next to them in the dishwasher as marks from pans will happen if they touch/rub during the dishwasher cycle. Overall I was looking for a dinnerware set that had more ""character"" than Corelle and would go with any table linens and this is the set."
1,PC compatible only! Whatever!,"I enjoyed the Epson 2200 and PowerbookG4. I wanted to buy this bluetooth product, but then it said... PC compatible only! Damm! What about Macintosh users out there? Epson, you should do something!"
2,I'm quite surprised this is in reprint,"I'm a bachelor; of the old school. I was terribly excited when I found this book; a first edition, bound in snakeskin of all things. A topic close to my heart, in an amazing binding! I figured it would be some plummy Etonian wit. I was disappointed in the contents. It started out as a curmudgeonly Thereaux-like rant about the married state. It degenerated into some sentimental hogwash. It was interesting in its (possibly fictional) account of rural Britain and Italy of the day. I figured this was something written and privately printed by a rich boy to impress a chick. Oh well: it looks neat. I am surprised to find it in reprint; this is something which certainly should have faded into bibliophile obscurity."
3,GOOD album,"A lot of people from the Panic camp like to bag on this album because it doesn't ""jam."" Okay, this is not a ""jam band"" record. JoJo and the rest of the band have other interest besides improvisational music."
5,A real winner from one of R&B's best male vocalists ever.,"Although he could no longer sing with the vocal ferocity and prowess that had been a hallmark of his PIR (pre-1982) albums, ""Joy"" is as good as any of his 1977-82 releases. The title track was a huge hit but ""Love Is The Power"" and ""2 A.M."" are the reasons to buy this CD which proved (once and for all) that Teddy's career would continue."
1,not me,"Maybe it's just me. However, it was ""suggested"" reading for 2 college classes. It is a book filled with real life stories. It is not a book I would personally pick to read."
2,Good writing BUT...,"When I'm forced to see the word God on almost every page, it tends to get on my nerves. By page seventy I couldn't take it anymore. God this and God that... Is that what makes it Christian fiction? I like to believe that true Christianity is about living your life according to the teachings of Jesus Christ, which is certainly not easy, but should have little to do with all this pompous knowing everything about God crap. Just be a good-hearted and selfless person, and don't worry about what God's doing all the time. If everyone just did that, this world would be a much better place."
1,don't get it...,Everyone says this book is so good but I struggled and struggled and finally gave up. Maybe I missed a great ending but I'll never know. I though the whole story was a bit weird!
5,Michael Caine is brilliant in this black comedy.,"You're here so you're probably a Michael Caine fan. So, the crux of the issue is; Is this a performance you need to see? The answer is yes. If you're a fan of Michael Caine's you HAVE to have this film. He is absolutely brilliant in it. No other actor could have pulled this off. The wicked, sly, dark humor, the subtlety, killing people and not only making you laugh about it, but actually root for him. Caine nails it. If you're a Caine fan, you're not looking for some big obvious slap-stick comedy, you're looking for something a little more off-beat and original. You found it. Enjoy."
3,Murder mayhem in corporate America.,"Michael Caine stars in this winsome black comedy about his stagnating career and marriage, and how he uses murder to make them both more interesting (and profitable). Caine plays the anti-hero in this movie with just the right mix of cynicism and mirth to curry the favor of the audience as he plots his final moves to get ""the corner office."""
4,Excellant black comedy!!!,"A Shock To The System is one of my most fav black comedies!!! Michael Caine is top-notch in his performance of an executive who gets passed over for the position which is due him and then he just snaps!!Swoosie Kurtz who plays his nagging fish-wife just adds to this poor man's state.This film is done with such class,such panache! A must see for Michael Caine fans! I own a copy myself and think it is one of his best films.Entertaining and thought provoking to the end as Michael Caine narrates his views and maniacal plans for revenge!"
2,That breeze ain't an open window,Not that I know everything about crime - especially getting away with it - but A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM made it look too easy. Performances by Michael Caine as a done-wrong-now-doin'-wrong angry executive and Will Patton as the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on television. But A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM needed to close a few holes in its story to make it worthy of your movie theater/home video payment.
2,But anyone else could have done this!,"Unfortunately disappointing. Aside from the interesting keyboards solos on Starship Trooper and the Spanish Wizard and the pretty keyboard bridges and lyrics on The Neverending Road, anyone else could have written this album and that is precisely the problem. This is just too easy Rick! Your backup band does not shine: elementary drum sequences, trite electric guitar passages. One gets the impression the album was done in a hurry, for the sake of exposure. The Neverending Road is still notable though for its simplicity and the beauty of its keyboard bridges. Overall, this album is plagued by an unfortunate over reliance on synthesizers which reminds the listener that the use of synthesizers can be very challenging as far as achieving original results. This is what happens when one's attempt does not quite get to that point."
5,"""Looking Out For Number One"" helped me look out for others!","We have to take care of ourselves before we can be of much use to anyone else. In order to give, I need to have something to give. And Robert Ringer offers his advice on how to take care of yourself.He deals with friends, financial matters and romance, to name a few. He gives examples of his great triumphs, many of which he learned after his big time failures. While he accepts no irresponsible excuses, he still writes with empathy -- he knows he has made mistakes, too. And because he has risen above them, he has earned his right to advise his readers.His humor and ability to coin phrases are unbelievable! Many times I remind myself not to let the ""Pop off mess up man"" take over(read it and find out what that means).My favorite section of the book is his chapter on building a strong, solid financial life.Read it! And be entertained and taught at the same time."
5,Hey! It's back in print!,"@ the risk of showing my age, I read Winning... I clearly remember getting the hard cover the week Looking... came out. I laughed, I cried. That was decades ago.I agree that he can sound a little harsh. Sometimes ya gotta use a 2x4 to get the mule's attention. He got mine as a young man. I was working on a article which had me thinking about the priciples Ringer laid out... Even with decades of time passed, I can still recall the scene where bankrupt he was driving the rented U Haul with all of what he had left and driving past the beach.The theory of sameness and what are you offering that you cannot find in 999 other people hit a nerve. It gave me the courage to be me, and not what others wanted me to be. (Relates well to the slaps in the face for one in the sack another reviewer mentioned).Honestly I didn't know the book was re-issued. I'm delighted I can have a link from Amazon to send readers of my article.Tcat"
1,Ever hear of helping people?!?,"The title basically says it all. Ringer is saying that there is no reason to do something nice for someone unless you get something in return...""Simply stated, don't do something for the reason that it's 'the right thing to do' if there is no benefit to be derived from it."" (page 88). In other words don't volunteer or help another person in any way. If you are looking for a GOOD book read ""Perpetual Motivation"" by Dave Durand. I have listened to him speak before and he's great. THAT book will change your life not some selfish book where you only look out for yourself."
5,VENDOR SENT BAD COPY,"I READ THE 'READ INSIDE THIS BOOK' AND SENT FOR IT. WOULD HAVE ENJOYED READING IT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT TURNED OUT TO BE IN TERRIBLE CONDITION. GOOD BOOK, BAD COPY."
2,How to live your life?,"I read this book years ago when it was first published, and found its philosophy of self centeredness and selfishness to be appalling. Ringer ideas are great if you care about nobody and don't want anybody to care about you. After many years of working hard not to follow Ringer's advice, my life has turned out just fine, and I sleep very well at night!"
4,Eye opening!,"I read this book back in the 1980's. Although, I had periodically forgot the lessons within the book (which cost me dearly in areas of my life),I've never forgotten the book itself. The summary of the lessons in this book teach you that you must first love yourself before you can love anybody else. The writing style of this book is not formal. Instead, it is very casual which makes it fun and eye-opening to read."
1,It has broken. Sound does not come out.,"Sound does not come out from speaker of one of the two.Returned-goods exchange is also troublesome.It decided for me myself to fix.Wiring of a back terminal has dropped out.And wiring of high frequency and a low frequency wave is reverse.It is low quality.Is made in the United States goods of inferior quality like this?Made in Mexico is the same.&#65311;It is already below Chinese-made.&#65281;&#65281;Since it is anxious, speaker of one of the two is also already decomposition check.The terminal is put aslant and is moving unsteadily as worried.Adhesives are also protruded here and there.Such a coarse industrial commodity was seen for the first time.It is the quality which can never be sold in Japan.I do not want to already buy American-made products.Because a design and sound quality are good, they are regrettable."
5,JBL L830 bookshelf speakers,JBL is as good as always at speakrs and I recommend this speakers with out any hesitation.The box was heavily damaged buy UPS but the speakers survived and I think amazon should pay more attention how to rap it up safer way because everybody knows that you can't relay on UPS people.
5,Bookshelf Speakers???,"These are the best bookshelf speakers that I've ever heard. Live up to my expectations for a JBL product. I'm anticipating getting a JBL Wireless woofer to compliment these speakers in the not too distant future. Once again, Amazon has amazed me with their almost unbelievable delivery service. I got the speakers in two days, at the height of the Christmas season to boot.Way to go Amazon!!!!"
4,This disc will surprise you...,"Having been a fan of his previous work I bought this disc more out of curiosity then out of a deep purpose. It's a solid disc. This guy has the chops to put together catchy, memorable and thought evoking songs.Having said that.. I wish the record label that released it would do more promotion here in Canada."
4,WOW!!,"I just ordered this CD from this site and omg! How great it really is! I can't wait until I get it in the mail. I used to be a NKOTB fan and kept up with Joe and Jordan's solo stuff. The 3 CD's that Joe put out are really good! Jordan's CD is not that great, but ok (but I think it's more a personal preference). But, Danny's CD ""Second Face"" is truly the best of anything the former New Kids put out. I highly reccomend this CD to anyone who used to be a fan of NKOTB or to those people who have a really bad misconception of their past. You will truly have a different opinion once you hear Second Face!! It's nowhere near the same style of music the New Kids did (it's better than that!!!) And while you're out there, check out Joe and Jordan's stuff too!!"
5,Excellent when combined will all the right tools,"This paper in combination with an Omni Page monitor calibrator, PhotoShop, and an Epson R1800 produces the best (sharpest and most colorful) photographs I have ever seen. It is definately worth the price. I am rather rural, so I have to order ink and paper through Amazon, but I would have to order it in any case. Through Amazon, I always get both ink and paper in reasonable time."
2,This is semigloss 240 g/sq.m,What a disapointment. Epson used to ship Premium Photo Semi Gloss better than that. So much for all efforts saving trees.
3,It's ok but,"this is lounge, not deep house as I had expected. I was expecting to get my dance on, but this is not the disc for that, this is a cool down disc."
2,David Lindley,Nowhere near as good as the album El-rayox but similar vibe just not as good a mix and choice of songs.
4,Ain't No Justice,"This is the album Linda Ronstadt blackmailed her label into releasing... ""If you want me, you gotta let me produce Mr. Dave"" she said... It's very good...but I always preferred him live and crazier... A little too tame, but tasty... The man should have become a megastar...ain't no justice."
5,The King of Polyester,"Lindley is a great artist. His talents are limitless in his use of instruments. He is awesome in concert, especially with his unique songs.Do not miss Tiki Torches At Twilight...."
5,"David & the boys doing their thing, at their very best!!!!!","this Linda Rhondstadt produced cd is one of the most underated and unappreciated records in the history of recorded sound. IF you love real acoustic-funk-blues-world-juju-raga-rasta-soul and tiki touch- like music. Listen to ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone or"" Do You Wanna Dance"" to understand the pure genius of this man and his music. Not to mention Warren Zevon's weird ""Werewolf of London"".Like Ry Cooder on acid ! LINDLEY IS A GENUINE AMERICAN MUSICAL TREASURE!! it dont get better then this!!!"
5,Buy it for yourself and buy copies for your friends!!!,"This album is great on so many levels. It's fun to listen to yet not ""pop-schlock"". If you're a musician, it's fun yet challenging to play. The arrangements are mondo cool and the recording/production is first rate. (I bet most people don't think of ears when they think of Linda Ronstat ;-). I've bought this for many friends and family and it has become among the top favorites (if not THE favorite) of all of them."
1,Lousy.,"When the selling point of a set of films is the box they come in, that's not a good sign. These prints are lousy, and often simply copied from official sources, meaning this is basically a pirated set. Speng the money to get the real thing - you won't be disappointed. (Kino company for the Keystone, Essanay, and Mutual Films, and the Chaplin Family Trust for the rest.)"
3,"Great effort, mediocre result","It is clear that this book represents a tremendous effort on the part of the author, who may be a terrific researcher, but is, unfortunately, a poor writer. It needs major editing, rewrites, grammar and spelling corrections. If you can enjoy a read about a truly superb actress/personality that is only average in style, then go for it. If you are going to annoyed by low level writing,copy errors, poor grammar, spelling issues, etc, don't get it; you will never appreciate the Agnes Moorehead story.In fairness to the author, the publisher is really to blame for the poor text. The assigned editor is supposed to work with the author to do rewrites, reviews, etc. I would venture to guess that this publisher merely printed the manuscript in book form as it was originally delivered."
1,Dreadful and impossible to finish,"I am a big fan of Bewitched and Agnes Moorehead, so I was excited about purchasing this book. What a waste of money. It reads like a poorly written encyclopedia complete with typos and sentence fragments. It needs to be trimmed by about 100 pages and then edited."
4,Her Best Bio To Date!,"Author Charles Tranberg did his research well and learned things about this very private actress that earlier biographers missed. Not only does he go into great detail about Agnes Moorehead's life and the people in it, but he also tells us about her co-stars and the plots of most, if not all, of her projects. If you've got a favorite Agnes Moorehead TV show, movie, stage play, or radio show, chances are there will be some mighty interesting information in the book about it."
4,At last...,"Of the three books I know of about AM, this one is the most comprehensive, in terms of being biographical. It is loaded with references/sources, and contains lots of information about Agnes I hadn't read elsewhere. And kudos to the author for broaching the subject of Ms. Moorehead's supposed homosexuality without being sensational or doctrinaire about it."
4,Bewitching Star,"An extremely interesting book on one of the worlds most underated actresses. Well researched and contains information not previously recorded. The lists of Miss Moorehead's radio, stage, film and television work is extensive. This book proves there is much more to Agnes than Endora."
2,Extremely overpriced for what little value it provides,"I will give the book 2 stars for improving on previous editions. It, however, is still written more as a study guide or quick reference than an actual educational book. It seems to be quite vague in most areas, and lacking in quite a lot of detail on important subjects, such as actual examples of VOIP technologies. It is grossly overpriced for what little information is provided. You can get more in depth books from discount book stores for something like $10.Would not recommend buying unless Thompson's bribe of your professor includes your purchase in your class grade."
2,Not really all that wonderful,"I've had to use this for a Networking+ class and have hated and dreaded having to read it and prep class for it. The writing is vague and sloppy and there are many dubious and wrong statements. Some diagrams do not correspond to the text and/or are confusing. You will not get a good idea of many concepts. It's been very frustrating.I give it two stars because it is specifically for the Network+ test, but would rate it only one star as a general intro to networking because in addition to the above problems it is full of obsolete and legacy stuff like token ring, coax, NetWare.The chapter on ""Networking with Unix-like OS's"" has nothing about networking with them.My copy will be dumped into the library's free box as soon as the course ends."
3,Watch out for smaller size than stated,"5 stars for quality construction. This item is VERY well constructed.1 star for sizing. The XL size is nowhere near my size 12. It was too tight a fit for a relative who takes size 10 shoes. I eventually gave them to someone who takes size 9. He was delighted with the ""donation"".What a disappointment. If they had been appropriately sized, they would have merited 5 stars."
3,he likes them but...,"bought them last year. sometimes he complains that they are too warm. i think the rubber on the bottom makes too much noise on my hardwood floors, then again, mine are suede bottoms. slick enough to practice tango in, thats a plus. he steps on the backs of them so i think they run small. they've been in the wash a few times and no wear and tear so far."
3,Great Panel for the Price,"Even though I read another comment that it arrived broken, I took the chance because this was so pretty and a great price. Mine only arrived with one section of glass broken. My husband and I decided it added character and 'antiqueness' to the panel, so we were pleased with the purchase."
3,Expensive.,"It served the purpose, but it is too expensive for the product[3 pieces of bamboo] i.e $22. It would have been better it is foldable when needed."
4,Lipper International Bamboo Over-The-Sink Shelf,I purchased this over-the-sink shelf for growing basil and other herbs from my kitchen window. It can probably fit 4 smaller pots on it. This bamboo shelf is very durable; doesn't seem flimsy like some shelves can be. It also seems to be holding up despite water constantly dripping on the wood. The craftsmanship is quite good and I would recommend this to others.
4,Converted to a counter plant stand.,"Well made, looks nice, spanned the sink. Just didn't fit around our high faucet. Put it on the counter under a window and have plants on it instead. Still have space below to put other stuff."
3,HUGE - not in a good way,"This item is HUGE. I'll blame myself because I didn't measure, but I can't imagine it ever fitting over a normal bathroom sink. It's a shame because it is very well built and nice looking. I wish it would have worked because it would have been perfect in my bathroom. Bummer!"
5,Love my boots,"I just received my boots from UPS and I must say I can't help but be giddy about them. It's always a little worrisome for me to buy a size over the internet because I don't know if they'll fit, and I hate the hassle of sending it back. These boots are -comfortable-! I wear a men's size 13, and they are very roomy for my wide feet. They seem very well built and I hope they will last for years to come. I'm very happy!"
4,Glam For Japan,"I absolutely love, Love, LOVE my boots. I wear them to everything from karaoke nights to Fetish clubs to just around the house! My only lament and fear is this: seeing as I own the glittery silver model (I mean really, if you are going to do flashy footwear; what other style commands attention the way that make does?), I often see loads of glitter on the floor around the house when just walking around. Ergo I fear that all the glitter will eventually fall off and I will look like a pitiful hobo with trashy platforms! My qualms aside, don't let this deter you from being admired by all in your presence when towering over them in these fine boots. Anna Nicole felt she was envied with Trimspa, me I have my glittery platforms to thank for the envy I get. Just get as much uses out of them before the glitter fades! In the words of Stevie Nicks, ""the feeling remains even after the glitter fades!"""
5,super cute boots,"everything came super fast. like im not kidding i had my boots in like 3 days after clicking the order button. boots came from close, but it still shows that they send them fast. they came in tiptop shape too! no complaints whatsoever."
5,A tribute worthy of the Rav,"Rabbi Joseph Dov Ber Soloveitchik Z""ts""l is here eulogized by a large group of his students , and by members of his family . They bring out his greatness in ' learning' and the tremendous influence he had on their lives. I found the most remarkable essay of all to be that of his father writing to recommend his son as candidate for chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv in 1935. The legendary Rav is here shown to be also a considerate human being.The book is inspired by love, gratitude and recognition of a true 'Gadol HaDor ' a giant of his generation.Who reads this book will meet a great Jewish teacher and thinker and come to know more intimately one of the most important Jewish spiritual leaders of the past century."
3,Not quite the charmer I expected,"I enjoyed Henson's ""Mother Goose Tales,"" a charming, light-hearted children's series that aired on the Disney Channel many years ago, and from the enthusiastic reviews here, I hoped to find another series like it. However, the Storyteller series seems to be considerably darker and more disturbing. For those who enjoy the original Grimm's fairy tales (rather than the Disney-fied versions), these might be fun and entertaining. But I think those looking for something for younger audiences should be wary-- in particular, I was surprised and disturbed to learn that the ""arranged marriage"" Sapsorrow flees is to her father."
1,Overflown fairytale nonsense,This movie was a sterotypical portryal of two classic fairytales. The acting was overdone. The story was weird and pointless. It was terrible. There were no good Muppets. There were no good morals displayed.The best part of this worthless movie was the storyteller's cute dog.
5,"Please, Oh Please, Give us this on DVD...!","Superb! I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Jim Henson's muppet creations, as well as good children's fairy tales (I must admit I enjoy these myself, and I am now 38 years old...!).I only wish the missing episodes were available. The very best thing, would be the whole collection in a DVD Box Set...!!!"
5,ridiculously delayed video release,"Jim Henson's The Storyteller was one of the greatest achievements in television history. This commercially underrated series has astounding effects, cinemaphotography, scripts et al. It is about time that these perfectly formed stories have been granted a video release. Lets hope we see the rest of the series released as well as the Greek Myths which followed. Fantastic."
5,Where are the rest?,"I love the Storyteller series--my family used to watch them all when the show was aired years ago. I am still waiting for Hans My Hedgehog and the Boy Who Set Out To Find Fear to come out--there were 16 in all, weren't there? When are the rest of them going to be available?"
4,"ahhhh, bubblegum!","One of the Partridge Family's weakest sellers, ""Crossword Puzzle"" didn't even have a stateside 45-single release (Bell Records put out ""Friend and a Lover"" from ""Notebook"" instead!). Too bad, because the songs (mostly leftovers from the ""Notebook"" sessions) are terrific and David Cassidy's husky post-teen vocals are charming and warm. Opening with the kicker ""One Day at a Time"", it's clear that Cassidy knows his way around a hook by now, and he's fully in the bubblegum spirit. A trio of ballads (""As Long As There's You"", ""It's a Long Way to Heaven"" and ""Now That You've Got Me..."") give the record a kind of AM-radio feel, and, while the songs are lovely, they make the overall tone of ""Crossword Puzzle"" seem a little staid. But the next few songs are upbeat, especially the album's best track, ""It Sounds Like You're Saying Hello"", which could've been a hit single. Waiting now for ""Bulletin Board""..."
1,BORING!,"The overall quality of the singing and musicianship is very goodbut the songwriting is bad. My wife and I who love the first three albums just hated this one. Garbage! This album came out the same time as Deep Purple's ""Who Do We Think We Are"" which is considered a weak effort, but hearing this Partridge CD it sounds like a masterpiece."
4,David Cassidy's voice is smooth as velvet on these pop gems.,"FINALLY, this treasured collection of more Partridge Family song gems, utilizing the finest songwriting talents of the 70's and David Cassidy's velvet vocals, is available for the first time on CD.""Crossword Puzzle"" reminds one of how underrated David Cassidy's vocal talents were back in the 70's, as they're truly the engine that drives these songs...though I can't believe his fans have put up with his arrogant antics; blocking the release of his BMG/Arista owned 70's recordings so he can push his own updated hits collections. Collections of ""Partridge Family/Wes Farrell produced"" songs he always claimed to despise. Remember...his taste was Hendrix. :)So here's hoping BMG/Arista will now release ""Bulletin Board"" and David's brilliant ""Dreams Are Nuthin' More Than Wishes.""Hint to RCA: C'mon make all of us 30 and 40-somethings happy and release ""The Higher They Climb"" and ""Home Is Where The Heart Is!!"""
5,Sixth Ablum review,"I had been waiting for the release of this ablum for a while. Every song on the CD sounds excellent. I do not know why this ablum didn't get as much attention as the other PF ablums, maybe due to the fact that the PF show was in the final year. Who knows? There is a mix of PF tunes, with David Cassidy sounding as great as ever. My favorites are C'mon Love, It's You, and It's a Long Way to Heaven. Having purchased this ablum on LP, cassette, and yes 8 track(I'm old), I was anxious to see how the quality would be. It did not disappoint. Waiting for Bulletin Board to be released to complete the collection. This is a must have ablum for any PF fan."
4,Solid album on CD for first time!,"""Crossword Puzzle"" may not be the best Partridge Family album, but it does sound superb on remastered CD. The highlights include ""Sunshine,"" ""It's A Long Way To Heaven,"" ""It Sounds Like You're Saying Hello,"" ""One Day At A Time,"" and the beautiful ""As Long As There's You."" Many of the songs sound like they would fit in on the ""Notebook"" album. A bit bland at times, this album could have been stronger, but the packaging and liner notes are excellent! If you're a fan and like the other PF CDs, you'll like this one as well."
5,Well worth the wait!,"I've been patiently waiting for this album to be released on CD for several years now. (Okay, so it wasn't very patiently!) I know that a lot of fans find this one to be their least favorite of all the Partridge Family albums, but it ranks right up there for me. I especially like ""One Day At A Time"", ""Sunshine"" and ""Come On Love."" The rest are wonderful and fun as well. I've always found it strange that no single was released from this album - at least in the U.S. Now I hope I can look forward to the release of ""Bulletin Board"" on CD. That would truly make my collection complete and me a very happy camper."
2,The least of the PF albums,"Avoid this one, unless you are out to get the whole PF catalog. This was throways from the previous few albums, and most of the songs here should have been left in the dumpster. The first two songs, One Day at a Time and Sunshine are fine, the rest are dull. Of all the Partridge Family albums this one ranks dead last. Great cover though....."
2,Glorification of Laissez-faire lifestyle,"This book clearly ignores the synergistic nature of human beings. The ability to accomplish more through team work than individuals. It is a backlash against the idealistic 60's and is unfit for the 21st century where team work is a highly prized trait in the business world. It has good points on how individuals must be self reliant, but the author is too extreme in his views."
5,Excellent,"Robert Ringer's book is excellent. His philosophy, which dictates that all people should look out for themselves is one of the interesting ideas ever to permeate the self-help movement. While other concepts exist such as altruism and theocratic belief systems, his is a very vital idea. It is true that we are all responsible for the outcome of our lives. Looking out for number one will help you-the-reader focus on one of the most important belief systems this time-period has ever known - self-centered-ness.His book also helps people to resist being influenced into other people's guilt-trips."
5,"Take your life seriously, it's the only one you get !","Through the use of personal experience and a considerable number of laughs the author explains his rules of life that will enable you and those you care about to enjoy life to the fullest. This book was a big, big, bestseller in 1977 and is still relevent today (1997)"
5,Pure Magic,"There are not enough words to describe how much I loved this book and I can't even come close to some of the great reviews here. The character's were flawless, the plot flowed perfectly and I'm amazed at the wonderful story telling of Robert McCammon and can't understand how I managed to miss this fabulous book.In nearly every chapter, there was something that evoked memories of my own childhood, which made this book all the more special to me. I laughed, I cried and I cheered for Cory on every page.Highly recommended and this is a book I will be reading again, it's just that special."
2,Not for everyone I guess...,"I loved Swan Song (one of my favorites) and all of the Matthew Corbett books. I just received Providence Rider and will be starting that soon. I can understand why many people enjoyed this book. His writing style is exceptionally good. He develops great characters, good plot lines with lots of suspense and action. My wife suggested this one I realized going in that this was going to be a different type of story. I grew up in the sixties and it brought back a lot of memories from that simpler time which was enjoyable, however, to me, it plodded along and the story line seemed cut and pasted together. It developed very slowly. Nothing grabbed me and I was beginning to lose interest. I made it to the part where Cory is riding his bike with his friends and all of a sudden he takes off, ala ""E.T."", and starts to fly around. Ya, right. At that point, I put it back on the shelf and said, no thanks. This is not for me. I couldn't finish it. It bored me to no end."
2,Not McCammon's Best,"I have read most of McCammon's books. This is the first one I have not given 5 stars. The book is set in the 1960's and is essentially a coming of age story. If I had grown up in the sixties I might have enjoyed this book more. Baby Boomers would find much to like here.Even aside from the generational issues, I found the book to be arranged poorly, with sections that skipped randomly, leaving me confused at times. I also felt that the prose was overdone...as though McCammon was trying too hard.Finally, I felt the book was difficult to categorize. It is clearly a coming of age story, but it also has elements of the supernatural in it (such as a living triceratops that escapes from a carnival), as well as an ongoing murder mystery with a predictable conclusion.McCammon remains among my favorite authors. But this one was a disappointment."
5,Now for something completely different,"McCammon is known as a really good horror writer, but here he steps away from the horror for a novel about boyhood. Somehow he is able to step out of his own shoes for a bit and step into the shoes of an All-American kid. He captures boyhood perfectly in all its awkwardness, wonder, joy, and even terror. Some might say the book is written a bit piecemeal, but McCammon deftly holds the book together by keeping the initial thread intact while wandering here and there. This is not a middle grade reader--it's much lengthier than that, which makes me believe that McCammon wrote it for an older audience. I remember thinking that if I read the book to my grandson, I would leave out an occasional sentence or section just to keep things moving. But you will marvel at how well McCammon captures emotions we all felt as kids but didn't think anyone would be able to capture in words. And he does it very well."
5,Grade: A+,"Ok. I admit it...I'm not much of a reader. Being a busy high school student, I don't consider reading very ""fun."" However, what started out as an arduous summer reading assignment turned out to be...well...WOW! I ended up reading the book again several months later, just because I enjoyed it so much.McCammon's style of writing is excellent - but not so advanced that you wanna fall asleep. I had no trouble keeping my eyes open for this book (which is something I can't say for my Chemistry book... :) ), and I was actually eager to find out the ending to the story.The fictional story seemed so real and pure to me, it almost seemed like an autobiography. With several sub-stories woven together, McCammon reminds us all of the magic of being a child."
5,This is a great book,One to share with your kids ( although you may want to buy them their own copy)
4,"Quite good, really displays life how it is.","McCammon is a wonderful storyteller and really piqued my interest in several matters that the reading of this book brought up. Life is portrayed so differently in Cory's world yet really it is all the same as our's. Brilliant, though I thought some of the language went overboard, while other interjections were necessary."
5,The best book I have ever read,"Words cannot begin to describe the elation that I felt while reading this book. McCammon has captured the wonder of boyhood perfectly while managing to unravel a great mystery. Although I enjoyed the mystery aspect of the book, the real power of the story lies in its depiction of boyhood. It is uncanny how easy the book is to realte to. Everything is here, the magical bike, bullys, everything I remembered from my own childhood. The magic in this book is in how the child narrator views his world. Wonderful, wonderful book. Definitely worth the time it takes to read. Be sure to read this."
4,Pretty good book.....,"Boy's Life by Robert McCammon was a pretty good book. It starts out in a little town in AL with a twelve year old boy (the main character) named Cory Mackenson is with his dad at ""work"" and a mystery begins to unfold right in front of his eyes. It catches the reader's attention. But as the story continues, I think that is gets a little confusing to follow as there a lot of ""mini-stories"" that make the plot somewhat strange. Some stories were interesting, but some just did not make any sense in my opinion. At the end of the book, grown-up Cory talks about his new life- this is a nice touch at the conclusion of the book. Overall, it was a pretty good book. Not a five-star for me though."
2,This book didn't fool me,"I agree with the reviewer who remarked that the author was just ""showing off how well he could write."" McCammon injects his acquired, adult maturity into this little twelve-year-old, and we're supposed to believe this kid is this smart, this mature. Just because description is ample and words are carefully chosen doesn't necessarily mean the book is well written. I'd rather read something more credible, something along the lines of _Where the Red Fern Grows_, which, by the way, is head and shoulders above this collection of unattached, irrelevant thoughts."
5,THE BEST BOOK OUT THERE!!!,"At one time, I thought there were so many books out there that it would be impossible to pick THE favorite one of mine. When I was recommended ""Boy's Life"" at a local bookstore, I was hooked and read it in a week. I even bought copies for my friends and THEY loved it. A very engrossing and touching book that has its little nuances...one that i could read over and over again. McCammon developes his characters well...and although it doesn't seem like a mystery, it is! Again, wonderful job, McCammon, wonderful job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"A tantalizing boy's life, which could also be a girl's.","Girls, ladies, women. Don't be put off by the title of this wonderful story of a young storyteller's coming of age, as the author says ""it's a girl's life, too."" Go with him as he and his friends fly, see ghosts, grapple with an abusive teacher, meet the sweetest pitcher ever, and solve the crime of the century in his little town -- or do they?"
3,"Good Story, But Drawn Out","I liked this book mainly due to the writing. The characters are very well developed. This book definitely takes you back to that time in your life when you are on the cusp of being a teenager. Some of the parts were just gut wrenching and I found myself crying... like hard!I loved the journey through old school Louisiana and the racial issues, religion, and old timey way of life.However this book was just so boring some times. There would be entire chapters where I was thinking, geez did that add to the story in any way? The first chapter introduces a murder and you keep reading the book thinking.... so are we ever going to get back to that.Overall this book was just ok. I was so shocked at the 5 starts on amazon. You have to be really patient with this book."
5,AMAZING!!!,"This is my favorite book.I have read it every summer since I was 14 (I am 27 now) and it keeps amazing me. McCammon's style of writing makes you feel like you are right there, and you grow very emotionally attached to the characters. I have bought this book as a gift many times and have lent out my well-read copy more than once. I don't think words can express how I feel about this book. I just ""got it"" from the very first sentance until the last. Cory Mackenson is such a universal character that everyone can identify with. I would love to see this adapted into a movie, although I am not sure a screenplay could capture the magic of this book.I have read a few of McCammon's other books, and while being very well-written, no other book has touched me like ""Boy's Life."" Please read this book!!!!"
3,"Good, but I wouldn't say Great.","While I really enjoyed reading Boy's Life, I was not as swept up as most of the readers here (or as swept up as the person that loaned me the book). It was a good story, or I suppose, a good set of smaller stories. Each one was gripping, but some were just a little far-fetched. And I suppose that is my main ""problem"" with the book. I use the quotes to perhaps de-emphasize the word. But for all the wonderful writing about boyhood, and some of the more realistic treatments of fantasy, the truly far-fetched stories and overall neatness of the plot took a little away from the beautiful images. Don't get me wrong, it's worth the read."
4,Boy's Life,"I have to say that I hated this book at first. I thought the book was a mystery and was so annoyed because it seemed like the book was just going on and on and never got to the mystery part. I went back and read a review that explained that the mystery was secondary. The book is really about the adventures of Corey and his friends as they grow up and ""lose their magic"". After I realized this I started reading with a different mindset. The book was wonderful. It will make you long for your childhood again. Corey is wise beyond his years because he knows to treasure his childhood. Don't get me wrong though, the mystery part is good too. I won't give any more details than that because it will spoil the story. Highly recommended!"
3,I Don't Get It??,"I am reading this book to my 12 year old son and have about 100 pages to go and I must say that this book doesn't command a 5 star rating!a) This book is not a horror or even a thriller but rather a drama-adventureb) It is an incredibly mundane story.c) If you want to read a great book by McCammon; read ""Swan Song"".d) Although this book is in my opinion far from excellent I would of rather read this novel when I was 12 years old."
3,His Best,"Usually McCammon's books are pretty lame, but this one actually has some nice writing in it and develops a consistent and likable narrator remembering his youth. There is plenty of nostalgia for the old days in this one and until the end when the Nazi-plot thickens this is a nice book.I would say that if you loved King's IT and wished to heck there were another book like that with likable kids and all the nostalgia for the old days of Silver Flyers and honesty in small towns etc... you will probably enjoy reading this through while you wait for someone else to write another book like IT."
2,It was like an overused simile,"For goodness sake Robert...TAKE IT EASY ON THE SIMILES & METAPHORS.Please. One per page. Okay? Could you PLEASE limit yourself to one per page, down from four or five.Thank you."
2,Boy's Life- Bad,"Title: Boy's LifeAuthor: Robert R. McCammonBook Review By: Shon OwensDo you want a good book to read? Well, Boy's Life is not that book.Boy's Life is good at the beginning, but only gets worse from there. It gets just plain boring, and then unsatisfactory. It's boring because it's so slow paced. I wish I didn't have to read it. Even the plot is boring.The story is about a boy that, while walking with his father, saw a car go off into the lake. Later, he finds out the car contained a man that should have been in the ground pushin' up daisies. Throughout the story, the boy tries to find out who the killer is. How original ... and yes, it's that boring. I do not recommend this book."
1,This book is one LONG bore!,"""Boy's Life"" starts out with a good a premise and I have to say that McCammon does a good job setting up his mystery. Unfortunately, the book goes downhill from there. The book lose track of its central premise and loses itself on a bunch of unrelated, nonsensical tangents. The books loses the central plot for chapters at a time before comming back to it. McCammon seems almost self aware that his book just about a small town with murder mystery that just doesn't quite fit when the character of Vernon writes a book with a similar problem. This book would be at least a 4 star book if it got the point and was about 200 pages shorter. As a mystery novel, it just misses the mark."
1,Do not read,"This is one of the most pointless books I have ever read. All it is is a bunch of short stories, all mostly bad, combined into one, to make one big bad story. It is portrayed as an emulation of part of the author's childhood, but you can tell it was all fictional. It jumps from topic to topic, and each section is worse than the one before. McCammon gives away the murderer halfway through the book, and when he officially announces the murderer, there is no point in reading after that because the ending is utterly horrible. It is the same old type of ending. So, as I say in the title, please do not read this book."
3,New tenderness in Fante,"Fante leaves behind the extreme characters that used to colour his stories and draws new feelings in his writing. With a parsimony that perhaps Fante gained with maturity, Full of Life discloses a part of Fante that I wouldn't expect from him, but at the same time is as much as his as the Bandini saga. Nonetheless, faithfull to Fante's style Full of Life leaves you that bitter-sweet taste in your mouth that can only come from honest writing."
2,NOT the Fante I've come to love,"The Road to Los Angeles; and Ask the Dust!!! 2 fantastic books. Raw, perceptive. Full of Life felt like a 'nice' book. Family, expectant fatherhood. OH! It was so sweet. I've come to like the Bandini stories. Fante pulls out all the stops in the other books. I got about half-way through Full of Life and stuck it on the shelf"
5,"Simple, yet detailed",This book is great. It explains all the physiological changes in words and terms that are completely understandable. Not much variety of workouts so you will need something supplemental if you were very active before conception. Great exercises for a beginner.
3,disappointing,"This book would have been quite different if it had been written by a woman who has actually experienced pregnancy and childbirth. While much of her research seems clinically accurate, there is no experiential connection on the part of the author. She doesn't know enough about what feels good and what feels wrong when you're pregnant. In addition, the author warns against certain Yoga positions (like downward dog and other inversions), which are not only a safe, standard part of prenatal Yoga practice, but feel really good when you're pregnant. Having not had the experience of pregnancy, the author is not adequately familiar with the extent of the abilities of a pregnany woman who is fit to begin with, and therefore spends much of this text warning against activities which are quite safe and beneficial during pregnancy."
4,MUSTAINE DOES NOT SING OR PLAY ON THIS ALBUM,"""Excellent Debut, but no Hetfield, July 24, 2003Reviewer: An Amazon.com Customer from Minneapolis, Metallica Capital of the WorldTracks like No Remorse are awesome & very similar to songs you will hear on Ride the Lightning, but something to know for you young 'tallica fans - Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, was the original lead vocalist for Metallica. Thus, if you like Megadeth you will like this album, while those longing for the rasp of Hetfield will remain unfulfilled.Peace out,Oxp.s. Mustaine also sings on the title track on 'Ride the Lightning' ""the reviewer above was wrong, while Mustaine wrote 7 of the songs on Kill 'Em All and the title track for Ride The Lightening, he did not appear on any of the tracks on either of those albums. i personally love Kill 'Em All, but i like Killing is my Business... by Megadeth more."
3,Comments about this particular CD from cdgiveaways inc.,"I bought this from cdgiveaways inc and was fulfilled by Amazon. The CD is not a US pressing of the album, but an Argentinian edition. That wouldn't be an issue except at first glance it looks like a bootleg because of the absolutely shoddy reproduction of the album artwork. Bleeding colors, piss poor paper stock and just plain ugly to look at. The disc itself fares better at least and contains Am I Evil? & Blitzkrieg like an earlier edition of the CD had in the US, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the disc or packaging. I guess 3 stars is good enough for this edition of the album, barely though."
3,Am I Evil,How could they leave off the best song on Kill'Em All? Am I Evil was by far and away the best song and they didn't even put it on the cd! That sux.
4,this was the best bass solo ever,The song (Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth is a tribute to the late musician Cliff Burton. The way he plays you never would of thought it was a bass . This is one of my favorite songs and I'd recomend this album to anyone.
3,Major Label Debut,"Metallica's 1983 major label debut on Mega Force records is regarded as a classic. The main problem is its lack of standout tracks other than Seek and destroy. IMO, it's a generic thrash metal album. Kirk Hammet is on lead guitar here, not Dave Mustaine and Cliff Burton is on bass guitar. Still head and shouldes above most of their post Black album material, this is when Metallica went platinum with no radio play. Still i would recommend it to people who haven't heard it before or to fill their collection. Overall, mediocre thrash metal by Metallica."
5,This is Metallica's best album,This is their best work and the definitive thrash metal of all time. All of their good work was in the 80s and everything since and including the black album has been ordinary at best.
4,Pure Raw Metallica,"Originally released in 1983 ""Kill `em All"" was Metallica's first album. The album was re-released in 1995. This album represents Metallica in their rawest form. Similar bands from the genre included: Exodus, Testament, Forbidden and England's Venom.Metallic was formed in 1981 by drummer Lars Ulrich and vocalist James Hetfield in Los Angeles California. They have released ten full-length albums and show no signs of slowing down.""Kill `em All"" is Metallica at its most visceral level. The guitar riffs and solos explode with crackles of electricity. Lars Ulrich's drums thunder throughout each song. James Hetfield's throaty lyrics help push anyone listening into head banging ecstasy.I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who wishes to explore the ferocity of heavy metal music. I also believe anyone interested in the west coast metal underground scene, that exploded in the early eighties, would find this CD essential to their listening experience."
1,NOT GOOD!!!!,"I don't see why so many people are praising this album, because it's not good. It's inadequate, and close to being poor. I thought I would like this group, since I was a fan of Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and AC/DC, but this doesn't compare. If this is considered good rock, music has gone down big time."
1,Not my cup of tea.......,"First off, I will say Metallica is talented. They were the best of the ""thrash"" bands when the genre started. However, I never cared for thrash or speed. Playing as fast as possible does not make a band better, or more metal, or truer to the music. Groups like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath are true metal. You might call it ""hard rock"", but it's the real heavy metal. This stuff is influenced by punk. A lot of people like the heavy, fast style, but real metal and hard rock has some melody. This stuff is the start of modern heavy music. If you want to find out about real classic metal, try groups like UFO and Scorpions, Thin Lizzy and Nazareth, Blue Oyster Cult and Triumph, Whitesnake and AC/DC, and the above listed groups. Long live real metal!"
1,THIS CD IS VERY BAD,"This cd is like blah blah blah. Kill 'em all has no style to it. If you like metallica, than you should get reload, garage inc. or the black album. Pass on this cd."
2,It doesn't live up to the high praise,"Everyone is telling me how the debut album is meant to be amazing and almost as good as Puppets. I listened to it loads and decided what utter trash it was. Don't waste your money on it, and buy a good album like 'ride the lightning', master of puppets' or'...andjustice for all'"
3,not all its made out to be,"First off I would like to say that metallica became sell outs, after cliff died. This album is mediocre at best. It's dull and boring. Kicking Dave Mustaine out was the best decision metallica made, because then we wouldn't have Megadeth. Go buy Rust in peace or Peace sells, they are way better than this album."
2,kind of a disappointment,"I didn't really like this album. The tracks didn't really stand out, the guitar and vocals were sub par and the audio quality kind of blows. oh well, can't win em all. buy master of puppets or ...and justice for all instead."
3,Not great but groundbreaking,"While not that great of an album,""Kill 'Em All"" is THE album that opened the door for Speed-Metal in the U.S. There are a couple of pretty-good songs (the bass solo, ""Anesthesia,"" is a classic in-and-of itself).As for the people who give this 1 or 5 stars, I have to wonder--do they have a clue about music? Why bother writing a review if you're just going to be ignorant and extreme (or is that a redundancy?) [rant over].Even if you're not the biggest Metallica fan, this album is worth buying just to hear where Speed-Metal came from."
3,Beginning of a legend,"This is where it all started some 17 years ago. Metallica would go on to become the world's biggest rock/metal band in the coming years but here on this album is where the dream began.Kill 'Em All is a fine debut from the boyz. It contains some of Metallica's finest offerings e.g. The Four Horsemen cut with Dave Mustaine(now of Megadeth)and the awesome Whiplash which goes into detail about life on the road, touring etc. Unique to this album as far as I know is a ""bass instrumental"" from the mighty Cliff Burton.However despite its good points, this album is let down by some weak, rushed songs like No Remorse and Phantom Lord.On first hearing this album is top class, however it soon becomes evident that later albums totally eclipse this effort most notably Ride the Lightning and The Black Album. A fine addition to any rock fans collection but you could do better."
4,MetallicaTHP,"The beginning of Metallica, their first album Kill 'Em All features an extreme onslaught of thrash metal. The bands who influenced Metallica like Motorhead, Diamond Head, Danzing, Discharge, also great bands like Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, as well as Judas Priest are ever present on the album. If you like any of the above bands you will surely love Kill 'Em All. The music is tight fast and very agressive, the band plays together as a unit, the whole time like they always do but the first three reign superior in this category. Such classics as The Four Horesmen, Seek And Destroy, and Jump In The Fire are the real highlights, but other great ones like Motorbreath and, Whiplash which has became a concert favorite, make this a truly remarkable album. It's raw but all Four Horsemen, James, Lars, Kirk, and Cliff play with such an uncanny tenacity this album is untouchable to all. A truly great album."
5,BEST THRASH CD EVER!,"Old Metallica is the best thrash metal you will find, better than old Slayer, better than Pantera, better than any thrash band ever!! I love the new matallica, but old thrash is better! The new Metallica (St. Anger) is going to be thrash metal like they they used to make! I have been listening to Metallca as far back as i can remember, and they are still my favorite band! This is the first Metallica cd, its good, but its still not as good as Lightning or Puppets, but its still awesome! Hit The Lights is an awesome and very catchy song. My favorite song is probaly Whiplash, its really fast and it will make you want to bang your head against something.So if you want real thrash Metal check out Metallica, and buy St.Anger on June 10"
5,Absolutely Sweet,"This CD being Metallica's very first CD sure putts an awsome impression on them as being the heaviest rock band on earth. This was a good start to their music career, I highly recommend buying this CD by Metallica. It is well worth the money"
4,Where it all began.......,"Hard to believe how good of musicians James, Lars, Cliff, and Kirk were just when they started out. Though the songs aren't as memorable as their later works, they are just as good and lightning fast as their future masterpieces. You can hear a punk influence on ""Motorbreath"" (either that or James was listening to too much Motorhead), and ""Seek & Destroy"" is still a heavy metal anthem that Metallica even plays today at their concerts. This is a classic and a landmark for the early thrash era. If you like older thrash music, check out Megadeth, Anthrax, and Pantera's albums for a rockin good time."
5,"This is the true essence of Metallica. No Kill 'em All, No Metallica.","1989. I was 12, and started with rock music, by listening to Def Leppard. Me and a friend used to listen to several tracks over and over. After a month or so, I returned to my friend's place and commented over one of DL's older albums. He replied: ""I'm no longer with that stuff"". ""Listen to true heavy metal"". He put a tape and it started to play and incredible fast heavy distortion riff. And when the vocals came out, I barely got some lyrics like ""...it is going to... take your breath away."" In fact, it took my breath away for ever. I was officially introduced to my all-time favorite band. The track was ""Motorbreath"" from the all-mighty ""Kill 'em All"". The rest is history.No Metallica fan can be allowed to call himself a fan, if this albums is missing. Period."
4,Really Good Heavy Metal Album,"This is a really good cd that shouldnt be labeled thrash metal, its heavy metal plain and simple. It contains: The Four Horsemen, Seek & Destroy, Whiplash, Phantom Lord and Jump in the Fire.Kill Em All is also a great debut album for any band. But they do owe some of the result to Dave Mustaine, as he co-wrote a few of the songs on here and probably some of the guitar riffs on other songs. This began Metallica's journey towards stardom as their next three cd's would all be classic."
4,Beginning of History,"Being the first album of Metallica is an enough reason to buy this album.It is from those old-good trash days.You will love Seek And Destroy , Jump In The Fire and Whiplash also No Remorse and Phantom Lord are very good."
4,A little bit repetative,If only Metallica could write a song or album without a million palm muted open E notes on the 6th string.
3,"Excellent Debut, but no Hetfield","Tracks like No Remorse are awesome & very similar to songs you will hear on Ride the Lightning, but something to know for you young 'tallica fans - Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, was the original lead vocalist for Metallica. Thus, if you like Megadeth you will like this album, while those longing for the rasp of Hetfield will remain unfulfilled.Peace out,Oxp.s. Mustaine also sings on the title track on 'Ride the Lightning'"
3,great debut,This album explodes with such thundering force! They were a young and hungry band back in 1983 and in this album it shows!
2,Nothing amazing,"There is nothing good about this album. The songs are mediocre, the lyrics are beyond cheesy and the riffs may be fast but are boring. The solos are terrible, every lick in the album sounds the same and all kirk does is descend and ascend in the pentatonic scale really fast, which is pathetic, in my opinion.I think that master of puppets is a much better album overall and if you are looking for good guitar solos do NOT buy this album, listen to music of guitarists which are a 1000 times better than Kirk such as Satriani, Vai and Yngwie Malmsteen."
2,overrated the album not the band,this is not mettalicas best work its the least medlodic most thrash sounding album ive ever heard just sounds a bit dumb to me there are some good tracks like seek and destroy and a gew others but this album is very overrated i do not see the metallica who wrote master the puppets ride the lightning or black album in this cd is a piece of history but not really worth your cash if your gonna listen to it
1,Big Mistake,This album was originaly recorded with Dave Mustaine on Lead Guitar Since his absence The Guitar solos Just dont Cut as Much as they were ment to Sorry But Kirk You are No Mustaine Truth Hurts but it Needs to be spoken
1,"""This is the worst metal debut ever!!!!""","TERRIBLE, comes to mind when i heard this garbage? i live for heavy metal, but not metallica. i have been a loyal metalhead since 1988. and up until february of this year i never listened to, 'kill em' all', all the way through. i hated it!!! i knew i would hate it even before i finally listened to it! now, MASTER OF PUPPETS & AND JUSTICE FOR ALL..., kicks ass!!! but anything before or after that blows!!!! metallica has never really impressed me, but i do give them the respect for bringing thrash, speed metal to the table!!!! if you want to know what a real metal album sounds like then check out: SEASONS IN THE ABYSS, ARISE, LOW, CLEANSING, and the metal album above all metal albums, VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER!!!! and by the way the best heavy metal debut of all time goes to, MACHINE HEAD'S 'BURN MY EYES'!!!!! metallica is dead it is time to move on?!"
3,some songs become repitive,"This is Metallicas first album and it differs from later ones in many ways. It has much more of a ""trash"" sense than older albums with songs such as ""motorbreath"" and ""metal militia"" other good songs on the album include ""4 horsemen"" and ""hit the lights."" However this album is much more primitive than later ones at least instrumentally, songs such as ""jump in the fire"" and ""seek and destroy"" are basically one riff repeated over and over again. Not to much excitement. This is still a good album however and should be purchased by any Metallica fan."
4,KOOL,NOT BAD I MUST SAY LISTEN TO THIS CD AND THEN TO ONE OF KISS'S CD'S AND TELL ME DO THEY SOUND ALOT LIKE METALLICA IN THIS ALBUM? WELL FOR ME I MUST SAY I LUV THIS CD AND METALLICA IS DA BOMB IN IT ALSO.... SOME OF THE SONGS ARE SOME WHAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND CAUSE OF THEM SINGING IT SO FAST BUT WHIPLASH IS AWSOME KEEP IT COMMING METALLICA
4,Metallica's First,"Here it is. The birth of speed/thrash as we know it. Metallica deserves no small credit for the establishment of this genre. Never before had metal bee ns ointense.Most of the music is killer, with the obvoius throwaways and cheesy lyrics that dog every group's first album. Hit the Lights and No Remorse fall flat, and the bass instrumental Anestesia gets tedious after awhile, but the rest SHRED. From Four Horsemen to Jump in the Fire to Phantom Lord to Metal Militia, all classics. A must for every thrash fan."
4,A Classic,"The original sound of Metallica back when these guys were young and crazy, this is straight-out raw thrash metal; no ballads, and not a slow song on here. Though it's their next three albums where Metallica made a name for themsleves and formed a sound of their own, this remains a classic among metalheads. Although they show hints of their future progress in ""The Four Horsemen"" and ""Phantom Lord"", they mostly play to their influences on this one, with lyrics that don't go too deep but talk about how they love to rock and other trademark metal themes like the appocalypse. Former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine (now known for Megadeath) co-wrote several songs on here and the late Bassist Ciff Burton shows his skills on his solo track ""(Anesthesia)-Pulling Teeth"". It's not their best, but it is the beginning of something great and every true Metallica fan should own it."
4,The beginning - not yet the peak,"This album is the debut of one one the greatest rock bands in history. It's rough and loud music played by a young band with a very young sounding James Hetfield - he doesn't achieve full maturation of his voice until later albums. The album starts out with Hit the Lights which is a pretty good song and best illustrates how young Hetfield sounds especially when he yells the song's title. The high point of the album follows immediately after. Four Horsemen is undoubtedly one of Metallica's greatest songs. The other two high points of the album for me are Whiplash and Seek and Destroy. The other songs are certainly very good but not great. Although this album lacks the mature songwriting, playing, and vocals of later Metallica albums, it's still exciting to listen to the band in its formative stage. Good album, but get Master of Puppets if you're looking for greatness."
4,great stuff,Was hoping to get the sleeve that has the lyrics like all metallica albums do. Cd in great condition though. I love hearing old school metallica
3,Very good album,"This is a very good album, full of fast and great songs. The guitars are just fantastic. It has a ""live"" feeling, which is good. The only two low points are the vocals and the drumming. It is remarkable that Hetfield became the competent singer he is today, considering his very poor performance here. Ulrich, on the other hand, never really developed into a great drummer, but his later work is definitely much better (he sounds like a confused, but enthusiastic, amateur here). Still, it is a good album, and an historic one since it marked the beginning of a new style (trash metal). Recommended."
3,Kill 'Em All by Metallica,"First of all, Metallica is awesome. Second of all, this is one of their best works. From start to finish, track after track, this c.d. makes you come back for more. Although ""Kill 'Em All"" is very good, it's probably not their best, or at least my favorite. No, that distinction would have to go to ""Master of Puppets,"" their third album. The guitar solos in their album are excellent though, as are the vocals (James hadn't fully developed his deep growl yet), which are sometimes more screaming than singing. Well, if I wanted to get into heavy metal, I'd probably start with this album. Thank you."
4,Great debut......4.5,"The only reason why this is not a 5 star album is because Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, And Justice For All, and even Metallica's Black Album absolutely destroy it to pieces. No denying that. Kill Em All however gave birth to thrash as you must know by know and also gave birth to Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, and a countless number of bands in the 90's. Hetfield's vocals arent there yet but he wasnt even 20 when this was made. Lars is the man on drums and Kirk Hamett is a guitar god. Solo after solo after solo after solo. Get the picture? The best place to start for Metallica in my opinion is Master of Puppets or The Black Album. Depends wether you prefer 80's or 90's. Oh by the way pick up Ride The Lightning as soon as possible"
4,The Ultimate Raw Metal,"Kill 'Em All sounds extremely raw and unpolished by Metallica standards (especially compared to ...And Justice and Black Album). There is a lot of anger and aggression hidden in the music. It's a decent effort by a great band, but the overall quality lags behind the later releases."
3,"respectable first effort, but not Metallica's best","While certainly energetic and fiery, Kill 'Em All simply lacks the sophistication and depth of Metallica's later works, both musically and lyrically. Still, any dedicated Metallica fan will find it a good listen."
3,Not as good,"A albulm I listen to once in a while. All Metallica is good, but this one is not the best. This album sounds too old, and James' voice is much more unique now. I like ""seek and Destroy"" The best, Especially live. I also like ""Whiplash""."
2,"Could've been much better, notably lacking in song structures","Kill 'Em All, to me, ranks as one of Metallica's weakest albums. The sound quality is terrible for the most part and Kirk Hammett's guitar solos are very long and monotonous. The only great songs are ""Four Horsemen"" and ""Metal Militia"". It's a shame they fired Dave Mustaine back in 1983, he wrote most of the whole album. Truthfully, the demos and old mix tapes from the studio sound way better than the actual production of this cd. However, if you want a decent solid 4 1/2 star masterpiece from Metallica, I recommend Ride the Lightning."
3,"Good, but only the beginning","This first CD is only the beginning of Metallica's career, therefore it's not great stuff."
3,"Metallica's worst album, but still rockin'","This is by far Metallica's worst album (sans ""ReLoad""). The sound of the guitars is void of the classic Metallica thickness. The lyrics of most of the songs are among Hetfield's worst, especially with his strange love for ""leather."" Not all is wrong with this record, though (it is Metallica, after all), ""The Four Horsemen"" is full of the changes in rythm and various riffs that make Metallica's music interesting, and ""Seek and Destroy"" definitely attains classic status with its infectious riffs. But... If you're looking for a Metallica album to start your collection, start with the far superior pair of ""Ride the Lightning"" and ""Master of Puppets."""
3,The only reason,"Let tell you all what's up with this! #1: The only reson I gave this 3 stars is because Dave from Megadeth wrote most of the music and words on this cd and the next few of them! If you don't belive me then get Megadeth's 1st cd and you tell me what's up. 2nd this used to be one of my fav tell I got into megadeth! Last but not lest if you think this sold out band made bands like Megadeth, Slayer, etc you are dead wrong! Look at those bands like Megadeth and Slayer they have never sold out and there style never changed. So who do you think is wins in the end? All hail kings of metal Slayer and Megadeth!!!!"
4,birth of a short-lived legend,"This is metallica's debut album in 1983. Not much to say here except that the later 4 to come are much better. Overall it is strong album worthy of purchase.Hit the Lights- 3 meh.The Four Horsemen- 4 originally written by dave mustaine that metallica STOLE! (half of the songs on here are like that)Motorbreath- 5 great song to drive fast toJump in the Fire- 4 catchy chorusPulling Teeth- 4 best bass solo i've heardWhiplash- 3 meh.Phantom Lord- 2 utter crapNo Remorse- 3 chorus is infectious and annoyingSeek and Destroy- 3.5 entirely overrated but decent songMetal Militia- 3 mediocore at bestThis album has it's moments of genius and some not so good ones, however that's to be expected of most debuts. I would recommend Slayer's 'Show No Mercy' as opposed to this one."
3,BAY AREA THRASH!!!,"is it possible that their are any metal heads that have NOT heard of Metallica,or this album?anyway,there is no doubt of this albums historical impact on the metal scene.though their are precursors,i beleive that one could say Thrash metal truly ""started"" here.now,having established its historical value,does it hold up?in my opinion,not very well...this is really,really dated.if your musical sensibilities are still in the NWOBHM,then this may perhaps still sound relevent and aggressive.for the rest of us,well, yawn.....start with ""ride the lightning"".for the completist only"
5,You Must Own This CD,You must own this CD because Satan commands you to. You have to own this one as well as Puppets and Justice. This is the music that made Metallica great before they sold out.
5,Correction,"Since I like the CD very much I would like to correct one of the reviewers. Kirk Hammett plays the lead on this CD not Dave Mustaine. Kill'em All was released after Mustaine was kicked out of the band. There is some of his influence in the composition of songs (he was a co-writer of some of them) but all the super fast solos that tomas likes are played by Hammett. Personally, what makes this CD much better from all other thrash metal CDs of Metallica's competitors in the early 80's is Kirk Hammett's melodic yet superfast lead as opposed to so popular at that time (Mustaine's Megadeth for example) ripping through the strings without regard for melodic content."
4,An essential thrash recording,"Ah, to be alive in the early 80s, when Metallica and thrash were young. This album is 51 minutes of violent riffs, bludgeoning drumming and piercing vocals. It's a primitive roar that they refined and perfected on their next few albums (Lightning, Puppets, Justice), but nowhere is it more potent than on Kill 'em All. Recommended for any metal fans."
4,Good starting point,"The debut album for the biggest band in the world is what is expected of an up-and-coming metal band. Hard, heavy, and lots of attitude. A lot of the songs are about physical abuse; Hit the Lights, Whiplash, No Remorse, Seek and Destroy, Phantom Lord, Metal Militia. This is a fun album to listen to when you're in a good mood. It never slows down and keeps your adrenaline flowin'. As almost everyone else says, I highly reccommend this album to fans of heavy metal or hard rock."
4,"Despite some flaws, still a great album","Like some others have said, when they first listened to this CD, they rushed for something like Master of Puppets (another great album), I was no exception. I nearly refused to listen to this CD for days. And then, in curiosity, I popped it back in. That my friends, is how I became a fan of oldschool Metallica. It is truly a great album which no Metallica (or detecated one anyway) should be without. My personal favorite from this CD is Pulling Teeth. It is truly the greatest solo I have ever heard! I didn't think it was even possible to make that kind of sound!"
3,"Three - and - a - half stars, to be exact..............","What else could you expect a debut album to be like ? It has many bright spots, but also a few weak spots.WHIPLASH, FOUR HORSEMEN, HIT THE LIGHTS, and PHANTOM LORD are superb...After all, these are Metallica classics ! Some might be disappointed in SEEK AND DESROY because the vocals dont have the energy or anger that it needs to be effective..But still, if you own all the Metallica CDs, you need to pick this one up...This was their stepping stone.Definately more hits than misses - but they perfected themselves with RIDE THE LIGHTNING."
3,"A good album, but the remastering is BAD","The oldest Metallica album, Kill 'em All. It's the head of thrash. I especially like ""Motorbreath"" and ""Seek 'n' Destroy"". BUT... BUT! The remastering isn't good, the guitars sound thin and dizzy and the hi-hats sound like noise. 3 stars because of the remastering. I prefer ""Master Of Puppets"" or ""The Black Album"". Bye."
5,the original anyway,"I have not heard the new remastered version, but the original is a primal thrash metal album, a must for any fan of the real Metallica, before they were nuetered."
4,The Start Of A Great Band.,"Metallica's first album was a success (along with later albums like Master of Puppets, Ride The Lightning, etc) I honestly think this CD is an amazing start to a great band. There are 2 or 3 songs that are ok, but the rest are just pure thrash greatness!"
4,Great tape but they left one song off on the CD!!!,"The Kill'em All CD is a great Cd to own if you like heavy metal the way it was.. But the CD version left off one song.. ""Am I Evil"" !! Which to me was my favorite of them all.."
3,50/50,"it wasn't their best, but it wasn't bad either. It was sort of a transtion, where they went from old metallica to new. the best song is motorbreath (song 3). then, the instremental is all right, and the rest of the cd is medieocre. in the song whiplash, metallica gets really egotistical, and starts ranting and raving about how everyone loves their concerts and headbangs all the time. The most egostistical line is : ""we'll never quit, we'll never stop, 'cause we're metallica!!!!"" obviously they were heady with sucess. oh well."
5,There's another one with two more must-hear songs.,Look for the one that contains Blitzkrieg and Am I Evil? These are in addition to the ones listed here.
2,not the original release of this,"This version of the album is not the original release. The original release included ""Am I Evil?"" & ""Blitzkrieg"", which for some reason are no longer included on this newer re-release. So I have a question for the remaining original members of Metallica...why are they no longer on the album?To my knowledge the only way to get a copy of those now is to spend over $100 on the box set. Gosh, thanks guys...haven't sold out huh?"
3,"Nice Intro to the metal world, not the greatest","Kill Em All was in fact a masterpiece of an album to say hello to the metal world and take listeners by storm. People were new to this kind of music and were thrilled by the intense sound it put out. I'd have to say my favorite songs on this album are Hit the Lights, The Four Horsemen, and Seek and Destroy. Also Cliff's Bass Feature with distortion is very original and I loved it. Overall, the album is good, but not my favorite Metallica album."
5,Very Underrated Album,"Though not quite as great as RTL or MOP, Kill 'Em All is still a thrash masterpiece. Maybe the vocals aren't as fresh, or the lyrics as mature, but this album will amaze you. Highlights include ""The Four Horsemen,"" ""Motorbreath,"" the amazing ""Pulling Teeth,"" and ""Seek and Destroy."""
5,wicked fun,"This album is interesting by the very fact that it *is* so different from their later works. Adrenaline 80s speed metal. Includes ""Am I Evil?"" - one of the most hilariously cheesy dark rock tracks since Black Sabbath. Wicked fun!"
4,"Great one, but still early.","This album is really good but you can see a large difference in the quality of songwriting from this one and Ride the Lightning. Metallica is my favorite band and this was a great beginning album. The solos are amazing and Cliff's bass is out of this world. This is defenitly the start of the four greatest albums ever, (Kill em all, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, And Justice for All)."
5,great debut!,This is Metallatica's first album and it kicks ass!!go out now and buy it!thrash metal to your face!
4,ground breaking,"I remember it well. When I was introduced to metallica. I was 10/11 years old, back in 1989, watching headbangers ball and a band I never heard of had a video named one. By the second time I heard the song, it was instantly my favorite song, passing up my appetite for destuction addiction. I got the album ""AND JUSTICE FOR ALL"" and I was HOOKED. Shortly later, a friend of mine who knew much more of there material suggested I should next get KILL EM ALL. I bought it. And listened to it WAY more then justice, even though I don't like some of the songs on it. The raw power of this album is undenialble. The song ""THE FOUR HORSEMAN"" to this day is one of my top 3 favorites ever. The riffs are excellent and the changes and solos throughout the song are brilliant. This is a song that represents everything about metal. My other favorites are ""Jump in the fire, Pulling teeth, whiplash, no remores, and the CLASSIC SEEK AND DESTROY. Fear not on purchasing this album. It is a metal classic"
2,"Sorry, but even St. Anger is a better album.","Seriously, as many people as there are who bash the post-Black Album stuff, all of it is actually better than their first effort. To me, the only tracks that really stand out are (Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth and Seek and Destroy. Everything else seems to prove that blazing speed does not equal good music, I don't care how intense it is."
2,First album-not-so-great,"This is the first and worst Metallica album.Seek&Destroy is of course the best one on here.Three songs out of ten are all I like on this one.It's not that great as I've said.I love the intro to ""Seek.If you haven't listened to this album yet than I'll give you a heads up on what ""Seek sounds like.A wrestler with black and white face paint used to come out to the ring to this song.No Remorse is a good steady song.Not noisy like the others.I love the bass solo song (Anesthesia)-Pulling teeth.One of the late great Cliff Burton's greatest moments."
3,HMMM,"i am a huge metallica fan, and this album is better than most albums; however, for metallica's standard, IT SUCKS!!!! but it is not surprising because they were a young band at the time and had not yet found themselves; this album is a lot of thrash with no feeling to it. the good thing is that they were able to find themselves quickly and made ""ride the lightning""- A TRUE CLASSIC"
2,BY FAR THE WEAKEST METALLICA CD,"This CD sounds like a faster and heavier version of all the other hair bands of the same time period. It has good solos, that is the reason I gave it 2 stars. ""The Four Horsemen"" and ""Metal Militia"" have very good openings, but then die off. Most of the songs are far overlong, and would be much better if they were shorter and less repititous. If you like early Metallica, I would recommend RIDE THE LIGHTNING."
2,Dated,"I'm sure that this was brilliant and revolutionary when it was first released. I was 3 years old at that time, so I wasn't really into thrash metal then.I enjoyed it the first few times I listened to it. After listening to the same songs played live (and much more recently), I really can't stand any of the tracks off of this studio album anymore, except the Cliff bass solo. James' voice is just too high-pitched and grating.Not recommended as a purchase. Instead buy the Live Sh*t DVD or go to www.livemetallica.com to pick up some downloadable concerts from '04. That would be a much more satisfying Metal experience to most listeners, I think."
2,Metallica's first album doesn't match the rest,"This is obviously Metallica's first album. It is probably my least favorite album of all the albums Metallica has made. The songs are thrash metal at its best, but it is very different from the newer CDs such as The Black Album or Load. This is a CD you have to judge for yourself, you'll either love it or hate it."
4,2 tracks missing,"When this album was first released back in 1983 it had ""Am I evil"" & ""Blitzkreig"" on it. So how can they say ORIGINAL release??? Bullcrap!!!"
2,I wish the quality was better.,"Ok..The music is awesome.But the quality of it all,the Way James used his voice.Its just kinda hard for me to listen too.But There are some MetalliClassics on here like the 4 horseman,Whiplash and Seek and destroy.I wish they would touch up the quality of this album.But I understand they were being rushed to make it too.The 2 stars I gave were for the 3 classics I listed oh yeah...phantom lord is a good track too."
4,Thrash is Truly Born,"Kill 'Em All was the first metal album of the '80's that really broke the glam-rock mold, and that in and of itself makes this a classic album. The material on this album isn't the most well-written of Metallica's career, but it holds its own. Not surprisingly, the material not written my Dave Mustaine seems to have more musical aspects (Phantom Lord, Motorbreath, Seek & Destroy). That's the one thing that set the Metallica (excluding Mustaine's writing) apart from almost every metal band, they were simply more musical. Kill 'Em All is essential to all rock fans, but there are better Metallica albums to listen to."
5,Pure Heart Throbbing Metallica,"Metallica's legendary debut album Kill 'Em All is cocked and loaded with lightning fast guitar riffs, battery ramming solos, and pulse pounding drum blasts, just what you expect in their older releases. I can just listen to this album all day. Kirk Hammet is an awesome lead guitarist, I mean you can hear him rip out leads 100 miles away. Whiplash, Hit The Lights, Four Horseman, Motorbreath, and Seek and Destroy are my favorite songs. Get this classic now or suffer. Metallica rules, well their old stuff does."
4,No Hair on there B****,"Haha, this is killer album, but it is let down to shoddy production and the drums suck. But it is a real showcase of MetallicA's talent, and what they looked like when they were a pair of pimply faced teenagers. Four Horsemen, is IMO the best song on the Album, Over Seven Minuets of pure Speed, Brilliant. Get this today."
4,The classic.,"Kill 'Em All, my second favorite Metallica album. This, friends, is what started the greatest sub genre in music! THRASH! This album has a lot of great tracks: (including, but not limited to) Motorbreath (Metallica invented YOLO check the lyrics), Seek and Destroy, Four Horsemen, Phantom Lord, and Metal Militia, just to name a few. If you love thrash chances are you already have this album. The solos in this album are some of the best from Metallica in my opinion. Of course this won't have the best production of all time, but for 1983 and this being their first album it isn't too bad. Its a must buy for anyone starting their own metal collection."
4,LOUD!!!,"I just wanted to warn people that this is not a fan for your bedroom; it is LOUD!!!!! The lowest setting is probably 2x stronger than the highest setting on any regular fan you've had. Having said that, the build quality appears to be very high and this fan is probably suited for noisy environments like in the kitchen of a restaurant that is lacking AC in the middle of the summer..."
1,unknown.,"i ordered the W.B. Marvin fan from Deerso but received a ""Powerhouse"" fan, which isn't the one pictured. I thought I was receiving the fan in the photo. I tried to contact the company through Amazon and got no response. I can't review this product because, to my dismay, I got a bait and switch. If you order this product you will NOT receive the chrome W.B Marvin, you will receive an all black Powerhouse fan. Be aware of Deerso."
3,it was on the sidewalk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the only thing bad about amazon is their delivery service, they had dropped my stuff on the sidewalk and left even without a doorbell.Other than that i would say........i still have no problem with the fan.it is a great fan for the price."
3,short & sweet,this is just 4 live performances from 4 Sony artists1.Judas Priest-Electric eye2.stevie ray vaughan-pride and joy3.the doobie brothers-what a fool believes4.jim croce-operator
4,Nice quick read,"I kindda enjoyed this book. I had never heard of it before and have read a lot of Jack London. Its a good quick read, not to deep or anything but well worth the time."
3,This is not a novel,"Unless it's printed in huge font, this is NOT a novel--it's short story easily available for free on-line. Don't waste your money on this edition."
1,A debasement of the original,"Jack London's Scarlet plague was well written and memorable. This recently produced rewrite is a dreadful travesty, poorly prepared and in no way comparable to the original classic. It is not deserving of the name and should not be so marketed."
4,A powerful player,"I purchased a used Walkman knowing it has a faulty charging circuit. The fault made the unit most affordable and since it will be used in a stationary application it will rely on plug-in power. I downloaded the owner's manual and PC software from the Sony website. While I just needed a high-quality CD player, I happily now have a great way to record sound files and super flexibility in how I choose to play them back. A well designed unit at a bargain price."
3,So-So Sony Sound Machine,"At first glance this little player looks great. It's light and slim. One shortcoming is that the information window on the controller stick requires a magnifying glass to read it (I'm not kidding). I can't get the ""G-Shock"" function to work and I can't tell whether the product is defective or that it is just virtually impossible to activate it; I spent almost an hour on the phone with Sony tech to no avail. They seem to think it is defective. For some reason when I am playing it, it skips often and this happens when I'm just sitting or walking (not a lot of jarring).The software is user-friendly and works well except that it uses so much CPU juice that you can't multi-task while copying or transfering.I'm going to try to send it back and get one that works right. I hope I don't get burned by the Amazon merchant I bought it from."
5,Timeless and True Talent,"Having personally known these wonderful people for 20 years, when they recorded this cd I was so impressed that i actually bought my own copy, to go along with a copy given to me by Eugene Owens. It is rare that a remake is actually better than the original, but 4U's version of ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"" is extraordinary. I hope the world gets ahold of this and it catches fire for the band. True musical talent and the gift of song is a rare combination nowdays."
3,A Humorous Mystery,This was a light mystery that was entertaining. I didn't care for the book with in a book format that was used. I probably won't purchase another book in the series. I would read one if I found it in the public library.
4,Hilarious,This book was so easy to read and absolutely hilarious! Can hardly wait to read the next one in the series.
5,"""Tweed"" contains excellent material","Very funny stuff, particularly if you are a choir director or a church musician. Schweizer obviously knows this world from the inside. When I read the children's Christmas program portion to a friend, I laughed so hard I cried. I'm going to read the other 3 in the series."
3,One of the more memorable Realms books,"One word of caution. I read this book when it first came out and haven't since so my impressions may be clouded with time. But I remember thinking this was a welcome change from some of the other Forgotten Realms books. Scott Ciencin is primarily a horror writer and, in an interesting take, he crafts a horror story in a high fantasy setting. The hero is a retired adventurer who now rules a kingdom but is forced to come out of retirement in order to deal with the threat of The Night Parade, a collection of creepy monsters. I remember it as a good book and a refreshing change of pace from the usual high fantasy Forgotten Realms fare."
1,"Disappointing, Forget This Realms book","This book, as should be obvious, is another of the standalone novels of The Harpers series.As a longtime fan of the Forgotten Realms novels, this book is quite possibly my least favorite Forgotten Realms novel. Some of the books are cliched, some are poorly written, and some are just bad. This is heavy on the last issue.As several reviews have pointed out, it was apparently too much effort for the author to use a Harper as the main character. So, with a weak tie-in they bring some supporting characters on board.The book also fails me in that it doesn't feel like a Forgotten Realms book. At all.Overall, this is easily my least favorite of The Harpers series, and arguably the worst Forgotten Realms book I've read. Skip it. There's plenty of other options out there."
2,Not so much Fantasy as it is Horror!,"Scott Ciencin is a GREAT author (Shadowdale was AMAZING), but unfortunately The Night Parade was a bit of a disappointment! It is much closer to HORROR than it is to FANTASY. Therefore, it is not your conventional Forgotten Realms fantasy novel. For those fans who enjoy Horror this is a book that combines the two, but for the rest of us, I recommend other books from the Series such as Red Magic or Parched Sea to mention a few, all the while keeping in mind the ""heavy artillery"" Forgotten Realms novels that have been written by RA Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Ed Greenwood etc My advice, read The Night Parade only after you're done reading all the other Forgotten Realms books and you are still in need of more Toril related material."
5,Difficult to take in all at once,"I picked this album and 17Seconds up on a rainy grey Saturday. I played the disk while I was doing errands around the apt. ""All Cats are Grey"" came on and I had to sit down. The piano at the end of that track still rings in my head. ""Two pale figures ache in silence... timeless in the quiet ground... side by side in age and sadness""... Funeral Party. I had never heard anything like this before. At the time I had several Cure disks (late 80s), but I had never heard their early stuff. I ended up listening to it at least a dozen times that day. I don't think any music will ever impact me the way this disk has....."
4,"Sombre, haunting, beautiful",'Faith' is an album that smells of bleak churchyards under lead-coloured skies in the dead of winter; lonely grey swells of sound that break you apart slowly. One of the finest albums The Cure have ever made. Recommended.
4,CLASSIC CURE...MUST HAVE,"This album is truly what Robert and the boys are all about. Dark and dreamy it floats through the compositions like a rolling tide. With an emphasis on heavy synths and bass (The Funeral Party, ect.) this album is a welcome addition to any Cure fan's collection. The sound is clean and fresh and suprizingly current. Get it now!!"
3,Faith,"This is an album that is dark and depressing. It's even more so than Pornography in my opinion but that shouldn't deter you from giving it a go. A couple of great cure singles in ""Primary"" & ""Other Voices"" along with a some of the other Cure classics such as ""All Cats Are Grey"" make this a very good Cure album."
3,Three and a half stars. Not my favourite Cure record.,"Well, here on the third album, the band's lyrics finally catch up with the music. On the previous records the music suggested sadness or outright depression while the lyrics stopped short. On Faith the song tiles, alone, reveal the story - The Funeral Party, Doubt and The Drowning Man are each as unhappy as the titles suggest! This is not an album that a depressed person should consider listening to alone after dark. For instance:""Stop my flight to fight and die and take a stand to change my life.So savage with red desperation I clench my hands.You draw your claws.A hidden rage consumes my heart.I close my eyes and tense myself and screaming throw myself in fury over the edge and into your blood.""The AllMusic review of this album referring to its lush sadness sums it up rather well. This isn't one of my favourite Cure records. I'm more of a music person than I am a lyrics man. I prefer what preceded Faith and what followed."
4,Depressing but Excellent,"Keep away from the razor blades if you listen to this one in a bad mood... it's pretty bleak, to say the least. But every song on here is great, with ""Primary"" and ""All Cats are Grey"" standing out. The title track may be, aside from ""Apart,"" the single most depressing song I have ever heard."
3,Music to Rob Graves By,"Sonic Death is my nickname for this gothiest of Cure albums. It is flat, dissonant and moribund--in a good way. If you're looking the Cure's truly gothic recordings, Faith and Pornography are your wisest investments. Where Faith is monochromatic and quite nearly rhythmless, Pornography is a day at the slaughterhouse: percussive, bloody and disturbing. I would recommend Faith only for avid Cure collectors or the mentally ill."
3,Two good songs,"Let's face it, this is not the Cure at the height of their powers. Primary rocks as does Doubt. The rest just go on and on without end. Although you'll enjoy a lot of this, it in no way comes close to the first two LPs."
5,Impossible to find,I originally bought my Kitchen table and 2 chairs at K-Mart about 8 years ago. I still lived with my parents then but I just fell in love with the set. K-Mart had only 2 of the chairs but I knew of a store where I could order more. 8 years later I live in my own house and now need 4 more chairs!.... they have since been discontinued. Luckily I found them on Amazon...
5,"Josh Wink, are you there?","This Rave Anthem from the 90's is a must have. This track made Josh Wink one of the most saught after producer/remixer/artist/live act, of electronic music. An undisputed blow to the senses, in the fashion of all of Josh Wink's tracks"
5,Deep Dark And Mean,"The band NMA is one of the least heard bands from the UK. I think that alot of the music is well thought out, and devilishly clever. If you know anything about US history, then You will know what this band is about."
2,dog gate,this gate did not come with all pieces and then the handle hangs up i have had crawl over it 2 times now because the bar on the inside just comes apart from handle
2,Trip hazard,Easy to set up and install so far we have 3 gates for our dogs and both humans and one of our dogs have tripped over the bottom rale - would not recommend to Seniors or people at risk for falls. Never thought I would be in this category
3,Metal Walk Thru Gate,"We have a similar gate that is about eight years old. We like the new one, but we've had a little trouble getting it to stay in place. Sometimes, it loosens up and moves its position on the wooden molding. It is, however, a fantastic improvement over the old standing gate. It is so wonderful not to have to take down the gate or step over it if I want to get to the other side!"
2,No Longevity,"I really wish this unit had longevity. I agree with a recent review that this player is awesome...convenient to use, reasonable sound and equaliser, and it is so battery-efficient. However I've gone through 2 of them now. I barely used the 2nd one before it gave up the ghost...what a shame. I would never in my right mind drop 100 bucks on a third...No way."
1,POOR WILLIE!,"I really can't believe Willie Nelson would put his name on this movie much less his face on the cover! He is my all- time hero and I just can't believe this crap-ass movie. First of all, Willie is in it for ONE scene! Second, this seems it was done on a home movie recorder! This was terrible and a waste of my 12 dollars! Don't get burned and buy this movie. Willie is still the man though!"
4,MADE FOR ARTWORK REPRODUCTION,"AFTER I SOLVED THE CURLING PROBLEM WHICH HINDERED FEEDING INTO PRINTER, THIS PAPER PROVED TO BE THE BEST MEDIUM I HAVE FOUND FOR MAKING FRAMABLE PRINTS OF ARTWORK PHOTOS."
3,Proportionally more expensive than the cut paper,"Is proportionately more expensive than the cut paper, the comparative costs are higher, but it is a good photo paper"
2,eats up the batteries,"although, this camera has many good features, it is incredibly annoying to have to replace batteries after every photo session (less than 10 pictures, maybe?). I decided to get rechargable batteries but you still find yourself replacing them as well all the time!!!"
2,horrible pictures,"This camera replaced a hp 1 megapixel. I was so disappointed in it. The manual is difficult. The pictures were horrible, I took 50 pics x-mas eve of family and all turned out poor. The facial features were so white sometimes all I could see was their eyes and mouth with a blob of white for their faces.I am packing it up to return to the store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Buyers regret,"I would not buy this camera if I had it to do over again. Of 5 digital cameras I have owned, this is 2nd to worst. There are many other cameras offering better features in the same price range.A major problem is the camera is a battery hog. It consumed 12 AA batteries taking, reviewing and downloading 20 pictures. (no video either)The zoom is very weak and picture quality is mediocre."
1,Very disappointed. Battery hog. Shutter delay.,"Nice looking unit. The camera has some great features, but two, HUGE flaws:1. It eats batteries, even the super-duper alkaline ones, in a matter of 15-20 shots or so. Unless tethered to the AC unit, don't plan on taking it on vacations unless you have a large supply of batteries.2. The main problem with this unit is the 1-2 second delay in the picture actually being shot after the shutter is pressed. Makes action shots almost impossible.Its a bummer. I don't think it was fully tested before it was released on the market."
1,NOT VERY PLEASED WITH CAMERA,The camera shuts off before you can even take a picture. We have changed batteries twice and the same thing happens. In the process of getting support through the 800 number but have had no luck. Think this camera is going back to the store.
1,Everything sticks,I am very disappointed. Everything I've tried to cook in this pan sticks. Useless for frying eggs.
2,Buyer's Remorse,"I love the great heating properties of this and other newer LC skillets, but hate that the finish is definitely NOT non-stick. They'd be better off just using raw cast iron on the cooking surface--at least you could season it and eventually get a great non-stick surface. The current black ""enameled"" cast iron cooking surface is poor and there's apparently nothing that you can do about it (I've searched many website and blogs in search of a solution--and virtually everyone has the same frustration). I've gone back to my $40 set of two traditional cast iron skillets."
3,"Functionally great, aesthetically not (any more)","I thought Le Creuset was the best of the best, and beautiful too, so decided to invest. This skillet is really excellent as a skillet, so I should not complain, however the enamel on the outside scratches very easily and unfortunately mine is no longer very pretty. I have a saucepan with the same scratched exterior (we have a small kitchen and have to stack cookware). I don't handle cookware roughly, but I don't expect to have to treat it with kid gloves either. I have an ancient iron enamel pot (German) which does not scratch at all, so I know it that durable enamel is possible! Are you listening Le Creuset?"
2,try another option.... it truly does stick,I really wanted to like this pan. I like the size and weight and durability / heat retention. I read the other reviews and thought maybe people just weren't doing it right but I tried everything and this pan is as sticky as glue still after two months. The enamel coating prevents any possibility of a seasoning patina building up and it just always sticks ... I care for it as regular cast iron but no good. Might as well be just using a stainless pan. After much more research I have ordered a debuyer carbon steel pan which I plan on seasoning and using as my non stick option .... it has rave reviews and my carbon steel wok seasoned easily and has been doing well so I am hopeful.
4,Have not had sticking problems,"I got this pan last spring and I really enjoy using it. I have not had the sticking problems that other people mention. I have made omelettes in it using spray-on oil and they have not stuck at all. Have used the skillet to cook bacon and sausage as well, again with no sticking. I do use a lower heat with this skillet ... it works much better if you do NOT turn the heat on high."
2,Not up to par,"I have numerous Le Creuset items, and this has to be the worst one. Everything sticks to the finish. Salsbury steak turns out horrible (can't make gravy), breakfast sausage patties become ground sausage pieces due to the sticking. And, like mentioned in an earlier post, it is hard to clean. Beware this new finish, (they have it on their grill pans also)it is not up to par."
2,"Great Barbie, Terrible Box","I bought this Barbie as a gift to start my niece's Barbie collection. This was a favorite from my own. Barbie is perfect, but the box is damaged. Sigh. A fatal flaw in the Barbie community."
5,Mike Reno fans will love this one!,"I have been a Loverboy fan since 1980 and love Mike Reno's voice. This album does not disappoint. Some of the songs are a lot slower than typical Loverboy music, but well worth listening to. They showcase just how beautiful of a voice he has, especially on If It Feels Right. There are a couple of good rocker songs as well. It is a great addition to every fan's collection!!"
1,Enormous and Out of Tune!!,"I was so disappointed in this mobile. My husband put it together and put it up to surprise me and threw away the packaging so we're stuck with it. This mobile is ridiculously tall and the music is horribly out of tune! There's no way I'd turn this on and hope it would sooth our son.Edited to say: #2 is now seven months old and he loves this mobile. Apprently he is tone deaf but he'll watch that red ""S"" go around until it turns off!"
5,"Emotional, gripping, this is what music is all about","This is by far one of the best blues albums ever, and a debut for chapman, what a talented artist she is, the song 'fast car' almost brought me to tears.Stop talking, and get this album, and that goes for all you britney spears fans, find out what real music is.Get this album now. what a voice!!!"
5,Heartfelt music,Listening to this music is as good as it gets. Chapman's lyrics are hard-hitting poetry that hits the heart. Her talent for shaping a song and leaving a lasting image is unparralled in today's cookie-cutter lyrics. It takes guts to stick out like Chapman does--and her fans love her for it. The only problem I have with Chapman is that she doesn't have a new CD out. Erin
5,Awesome!,"She won Grammy for an awesome song ""Fast Car"" from this album. Check wikipedia for the background on this song - generational poverty"
4,Classic Tracy,This is an excellent album with great Tracy Chapman classics.If you like Tracy I would definitely recommend this one.
5,Masterpiece album,Tracy Chapman (self-titled): An amazing voice delivering strong lyrics and beautiful tunes in one of the best albums of the era. This one is a true Masterpiece. Five Stars
3,Don't start with this- but...,"The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is Crossroads is so much better... if you've never heard any Tracy Chapman I'd suggest you start with that album, but this is very good as well. A couple of the songs sound very studio-ized, commercial, etc, but the lyrics are above and beyond most of the stuff being put out today- and it's interesting to see how she began. There are a few GREAT songs on this album as well."
3,cd,Some of the songs aren't my cup of tea. I like some songs on her other cd's but I'm not sure I'll get it.
1,This is what all the excitement is supposed to be about?,"I was working at a record store when this album came out (back when they had record stores) and was forced to listen to this on our PA system on a daily basis. Musically lacking any ambition, chock full of really simple-minded, self-righteous lyrics, and about as interesting as a ten-pound bag of fertilizer."
1,I wonder....,"..if, when the poor people come to ""get their share,"" if that will include the share owned by rich recording artists. Nothing worse than a hyporcrite, and no profession exhibits it worse than the entertainment industry. Chapman just happens to be one of the most ""vocal"" but is really nothing but the primus inter pares."
4,Extremely Comfortable - Don't Leave Outside!!,"This hammock is AWESOME when it comes to comfort. If you are looking for something you can leave outside in the elements, this is not it. Takes a while to try if rained on. I think if left out for extended exposure, it would start growing things!!"
5,Wonderful travel book from the early 20th century,"Compelling autobiographical story of a 20 year old American who shipped out to see the world and became a ""beachcomber"" for a while. First hand history or a time when work papers were more important than a passport. Flawed with the racism of its era, it is still an interesting tale."
5,Just What I Needed,This product is just what I wanted when I ordered it because it covers my ears and no air gets through at all. Also this product got here in about a week after I ordered it. Its an good buy!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not Bad...,"I dunno... These guys have been around Detroit for a while. They relesed an EP a while ago that was better. This disc is OK, it's just kind of... formulaic?"
3,"Good quality, unfortunate color","I've used this seller before and have always had an excellent experience, but i've never ordered this particular color of luster dust before, and i appear to have picked the wrong shade. This moonstone color is very dark, does not have hardly any shine, and i had to use half the jar to get a visible shade. i can't think of anything i can use it for - i'm doing some tombstones this month, maybe this will be the right shade for that, but i like the brilliant silver much better. Also, i almost broke my teeth getting the little jars open - now i use pliars."
2,A little ordinary,"I bought two types of edible glitter to decorate a birthday cake. This version went on very grey with not much of a sparkle or luster. Quite dissapointing. I ended up sieving more powdered sugar over the area that I'd put this glitter to cover it up, and used the disco glitter I bought as a far more sparkly alternative."
1,a bad bootleg of a great band,"This album should never have been released. It is just a bad bootleg put on a cd.(it has 4 tracks, each track has 4 or so songs, each tack must have been a side of a bootleg vinyl record). This is a shame, since UFO was a great band. Buy ""Strangers in the Night"" great live album that captures UFO at its peak."
5,I LOVE THESE GUYS!!,"I have every one of their albums in cassette tape, CD format. I can't get enough of this group! I hear one album and I want more. I was fortunate enough to see this group in concert just before they called it quits. I had a blast!! A reunion tour is obviously out of question with the loss of Ben Orr. He will be greatly missed by all Cars fans.If you have never heard this group, try any of their albums. You will not be disappointed!! I can't say which is my most favorite because I love them all. Enjoy!!!"
3,Last one for a reason,"The Cars were spent by the time this came out. Their time had passed, and their music was stale. I was as much a Cars fan as anyone, but this one was painful to listen to. Some have pointed out how they'd branched off into new areas, etc, fact is they weren't a band by now. They were just gearing up for their bland solo careers. The Cars had 3 different kinds of fans by this point 1) the rockers who liked the first two albums 2) the hardcore fans who put up with Panorama/Shake It Up, and 3) the mainstream that ate up Heartbeat City. None of those had anything to do with this hodgepodge of an album. They were recycling really old stuff (Leave or Stay/Ta Ta Wayo Wayo), and trying Country-New Wave, not a pretty thing. There are 3 songs worth having: Leave Or Stay, You Are The Girl, and the best song, Strap Me In. Otherwise, and it pains me to say this, garbage. I about vomited when I heard ""Coming Up You"" in a [local store], I knew they were done then."
4,"Pretty good, despite the bad rap","There are several top-notch Cars songs on Door to Door, despite the bad rap and the fact it was clearly their swansong album. All the Cars albums had an ultra-high standard of quality, and this one's no exception. If you can make it past the first two sub par songs, you get some of the Cars best tunes - Double Trouble, Fine Line, Everything You Say, Strap Me In, and Go Away. Ben Orr really shines on the songs where he sings lead vocal, and it makes it all the more sad that he passed away. Ric Ocasek's production job is excellent, and you hardly notice that there's none of the earlier, big name producers on board.Even for casual Cars fans, it's a must have."
3,The End of The Cars,"Another reviewer mentioned that if this CD was released before HEARTBEAT CITY it would have been better. I couldn't agree more. Ric Ocasek and the boys had reached their peak with HEARTBEAT, so there was nowhere to go but down. Not that DOOR TO DOOR is a dud by any means, just average. And an average CD from Ocasek is better than some band's best stuff. YOU ARE THE GIRL and STRAP ME IN are as strong as anything The Cars has done, but everything else is subpar. And the crummy cover art doesn't help matters either. If you're a diehard Cars fan, then you need this CD. Everyone else should stick with HEARTBEAT CITY and their self-titled debut."
2,SAD END TO A GREAT BAND,It is really a shame that this was the Cars final release. With all the promise of thier debut less than 10 years later this jumbled mess was released. There are a few good songs here but not nearly enough or anything really classic. Funny on all thier other releases the Cars crafted melodic pop songs that stuck in your head. None of these songs do that so it was obvious the tank was on empty for one of the greatest bands of it's time.
2,unhappy,The quality said excellent but after receiving the item I was not so impressed. The case for the CD was cracked and broken and the disc itself had some scratches on it. Luckily the disc played okay. Excellent quality doesn't mean scratched and broken. Very disappointed.
2,Idling Cars...........,"There are a few decent songs on ""Door to Door"" and maybe a handful are worth repeat listens. And even those are marginal, (with the sole exception being the tuneful ""Coming Up You"".) ""Door to Door"" plays more like an album of B-sides than anything else. It comes up especially weak in comparison to the stellar work that came before it. This album finds Ric Ocasek at his lowest ebb when it comes to songwriting. Dull, flat and uninspired. At this point, Ric was champing at the bit to get on with his solo career and ""Door to Door"" suffered because of it. It comes off more as a contractural fulfillment than a full-on effort. This becomes all the more evident when one compares this album to the far superior 2011 release, ""Move Like This"", which finds Ric reinvigorated and focused. I am a HUGE Cars fan and have all their albums. Only ""Door to Door"" languishes on the shelf year after year. Thank God the boys have reunited! Let the good times roll again!"
2,The rust is setting in,"Oh hell, what happened here. This would not be a bad addition to the collection for reved up cars fans, but lacks the sound we came to know the group for. Worth nothing more then a $1 bargain at the local record fair, the only song that brings the group to their trusted synth-rock style is ""you are the girl"". ""Double trouble"" seems to be a left over jamming session from ""Heartbeat city"", with some selling potential as a single, but sounds too raw. Would have been nice if they given it some more production work. ""Fine line"" was a shellow effort which somewhat reminded me of a Leonard Cohen song, but without the soulful texture. Most of the album sounds nothing more then some inferior noise, like the group no longer having that magical desire. Not worth the effort of re-buying on cd."
1,What can I say...,"If you look at my other Cars reviews you will see I did not like ""Heartbeat City"" very much, and I really hate this one. When it came out it was DOA, and it never had much spark to it. It reminds me of the solo stuff all the members did, it sounds kinda like the Cars but is missing something. I am a huge Cars fan, but I do not even own this one anymore and I do not like any of the solo stuff the memebers did. This was a sad end to one of my favorite bands."
2,Forgettable,"How anyone can rank this album as The Cars' ""best"" or ""finest"" is completely beyond me. I own all their albums and this is by far the worst of the lot. When you want an honest review of an album, just check out the used price. $1.68. Knowhuddamean?None of the songs are great. The best of them fall somewhere between listenable and good. Several are painful to sit through. The worst of them has to be Fine Line, which just sits there in front of you, endlessly droning on and on and on for well over five minutes. OK, I get it already. There's a fine line between us.The Cars crossed that line with Door to Door. If this album shows where they were headed musically I'm glad it was their last. Sometimes I think it's a shame they didn't call it quits after Heartbeat City and go out on a good note."
4,Happy With this Paper,I'm pretty pleased with this paper. Recently bought an Epson Stylus Photo R2880 and I can definitely show my work with pride on this paper. I've only used it for printing some of my highly saturated fine art photography works and it shows well.
2,Not the paper for detail or color accuracy,"I typically like Epson papers and have used theirPremium Glossy papersfor years. But I don't quite know what to make of this luster paper. I would like a paper with a little lower reflectivity for prints that are viewed under bright lights. But this sacrifices too much. I shoot at high resolution and spend time calibrating monitors and editing photos to get realistic colors. With this paper, detail goes missing and colors are washed out. It's possible that the printer profile itself is off, but I use an Epson printer (R800) and there's little excuse for that. Their profiles for other papers are pretty close.If you like prints that look like watercolors, then this may be the paper for you. I think it's going to take me a very long time to get through this pack."
5,Great paper,"This paper is just glossy enough to make a photo look professional, but with out the glare of high gloss paper. it also had enough weight to feel like it will last."
3,Nothing Special,I can buy similar paper at walmat for 14.95 for 100 sheets. Unless your doing archival work save your money. The kodak paper was better and cheaper. This was way overpriced and had a dull look to it. dont wast your money just cause it says epson on it like i did.Kodak worked better -cheaper-more qauntitiy
4,good paper,I have only just received this it seems fine but I haven't really been able to test it out yet.
5,Best Quality and Service,I have been using Epson paper for almost 20 years and have yet to be disappointed with it. Amazon's price and service is exemplary.
3,Ok,"It came bent so I lost like 20 pages, the package was bent didn't know If it was made that way from travel but ethier way I couldn't use 20+ pages cause when printing the ink smudged on the bent sides"
3,Very fine renditions of well-known sea songs,"Not a tresury of hard-to-find songs, but an excellent collection of some well-known standards. Peterson has a beautiful voice and his arrangements are superb."
5,Cord Keeper,It was just what we were looking for and we will order from this seller again if needed.
4,A nice scholar work,"""The Holy Kabalah"" is a nice informative work on the history and literature of Kabalah from the ancient years until 19th century. It is together with Papus' Kabalah the two most informative works on the Jewish tradition from non-Jewish writers. The book has also a very helpfull appentix.Much has been writen about the overloaded, artificial way of writing that A E Waite uses and also about his contempt for non-christian (and especially Catholic) way of thinking and beliefs. This maybe is true and I have nothing to add here.But if one is willing to overcome this, ""The Holy Kabalah"" is a nice scholar work for the student of the occult, the mystic, the magician, the scholar."
5,What I like about: Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit,"Jeanette Winterson's ""Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit"" is this amazing, bizarre story written with dialogue that reaks of reality, juxtoposed with ethereal myths that seem far too interesting for meer symbolism. I read it five times. I recommended it to every one of my friends. It is an honest-to-goodness fabulous book."
4,"To Be an Observer, To Be a Tripper","Reading Jeanette Winterson is experiencing the state of mind to be an analytical observer and to be a dazzled tripper simultaneously. In Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, Winterson's debut novel, the events are well-objectified and never get emotional while they could be; the author and the readers remain in the position to analyze them. At the same time, the arbitrary, not-clearly-outlined story penetrates into the audience's mind almost unconsciously, as if it was diminishing the line between the protagonist's life and the audience's one, between the book's world and the real world.The autobiographic coming-of-age ugly-duckling (sort of) story progresses back and forth, with flashbacks/flashforwards, dream sequences, and the-Middle-Ages-esque fairy tales which thematically parallel the protagonist's quest for life. Well-thought ideas regarding existence, history, and sexuality are inserted here and there."
2,Pointless,"Let me state right off the bat that I have nothing against homosexuals at all. I found the idea of this book very appealing and was anxious to read it. But, I really didn't get this book. I understand it was an autobiographical novel about a gay woman's upbringing and coming out, but I just didn't care for it and I found it pointless. The interspersed fairy tales made no sense to the story, and at times it seemed like it was jumping around like random thoughts that pop into your mind."
4,Strange up-bringing,"This book tells the story of the strange up-bringing of the author Jeanette Winterson. It is interspersed with little stories and fables which cast reflections upon her own life. She tells of her deeply religious mother and the education which led Jeanette to become a preacher and leader of the group while still a schoolgirl. Her sexual orientation led to ructions both at home and in the wider church community.I first read this book many years ago and thought it was ok but nothing in particular. I have just re-read it for our local book group and have laughed so much. I never noticed this before. The book hasn't changed of course, but it's obvious that a reader's taste can change over time. The work is not presented in jokey form but so many dead-pan remarks from the young Jeanette really amused me. She doesn't take herself seriously and is very non-judgemental about others.This is a remarkable book and justifiably popular."
2,Not as Smart As She Thinks She Is,"An impressive piece of work but irritating and ultimately unsatisfying. The structure is confusing - not really innovative, as many seem to think, just quirky - the inserted fables little more than pretentious nonsense. The characters, especially the mother, are caricatures, cartoon figures who only serve as opportunities for the author to demonstrate her superiority.Worst of all, Jeanette, both as a character and as a narrator, has no empathy for others in her life. She betrays not the slightest sympathy for anyone who behaves differently than she wants them to. In some circles, this type of behavior is known as ""sociopathology"".As a reader, this leaves one with no sympathetic or full-blooded chareacters, no social context, a plot that is as ordinary as they come, and a lot of fancy writing.I know this is a minority opinion, but I must be honest: I found this book annoying and pretentious."
3,good,"It is a very interesting book, with many issues discussed and brought to the public eye. I give a big thumbs-up!! Not to be missed."
2,eh...,I like the way that she writes... but the story got kinda creepy. The author was trying to deal with her childhood when she wrote this. It was a journey I did not want to take with her.
2,Oranges are not the only Fruit,it is like stream of consciousness writing and I found the story line sort of nonexistent. frustratingly so. I didn't finish it.
3,Oranges review,I found the book to be highly disappointing. Not much of a storyline for me. Not a page turner. Wouldn't recommend it.
3,The dots were unconnected,"I found this book disappointing - some really excellent writing and description, but the juxtaposition of Sir Gawain et al was disjointing and, for me, a non-sequitur. it felt like an author's device to show how well-read they were, rather than contributing to the story line. For me, the dots didn't connect, and I didn't feel the story ended."
3,Didn't really strike my fancy,"Unfortunately, I think a lot of the references in the novel were lost upon me because the Ms. Winterson's use of language and locations that are unfamiliar to me as an American (the novel takes place in England). In addition, Ms. Winterson' tale of coming to grips with her sexual orientation while being brought up in a religious family seems like old hat to me. However, my guess is that that story was somewhat groundbreaking when it was first published in 1985."
3,Cold?,"I don't know, I really wanted to like this book more than I did. It was possibly a choice for our book club, and I had voted for it. It didn't get chosen, so I just read it on my own. While I was astounded by the mother's shameful behavior and felt such compassion for the girl, I still ended up not feeling close to knowing her--she remained aloof. I stuck with it to the very end, hoping for enlightenment, but it never came. I just ended up feeling somewhat depressed."
2,Went nowhere,I only gave this book 2 stars. I had trouble keeping up with the age of the main girl and felt that as the book is written around her sexuality it was not explored enough. The mother an extremely religious woman was almost comical at stages. Parts were well written but I really felt let down at the end.
3,A waste of time,"It starts off interesting but the rambling almost stream of conciousness style eventually drags the book down. I think its one of those books that would make more sense after seeing the film, rather than the other way around."
2,I don't get what is so great about this book,"I read this book because everyone says it's a classic of lesbian literature. I don't see how it's a classic of anything. The story isn't very interesting and, except for near the end, it's hardly lesbian. Maybe it was all of the religious overtones, but I struggled through it. Some of it was hard to grasp for someone who isn't English, although I think I have better than a passing knowledge of life over there. It just didn't strike me as a very good book, but now I can say I read it."
2,Doesn't deserve to be on list,This book was on a list of significant books for lesbians from the last whatever years. How did that happen? The only amusing thing was how warped the protagonist and her mother are from the mother's fundamentalist views.
2,Moldy oranges are not the only smell that stink around here,"I just finished this book, and although it was a rather solid start for Winterson, I would recommend that you skip her early stuff and go straight to her masterpeice Written on the Body. I found Oranges to be rather dry and not completely formulated. However if you do find yourself with it in your hand, I do highly recommend page 170."
1,Don't Bother,"Let me first say that I was not offended by this book. I didn't find the premise vulgar and I have nothing against homosexuals.I didn't like this book because it was dull and pointless. No doubt it is meant to portray the protagonist's struggle to reconcile her faith and her sexuality, but it winds up being more of a random, slightly depressing tour through her life.The resolution is as unsatisfying as the story. Don't bother."
3,"Quite inspirational, but the overall subject distasteful","Jeanette Wintersons book is a semi-autobiographical story which outlines how one girl had to face her homosexuality within the church. The book is well written with detailed descriptions of the girls feelings. However, I did find the homosexual side to this story quite vulgar."
5,"This is the best book to date, about the Prisoner series.",A superb collection of photos & an interesting & fairly recent interview with the master McGoohan.A MUST for every collector or appreciator.
1,Chips-ahoy!,I wanted to save a few bucks and paint instead of buying caliper covers. I know paint prep is important for this type of job and spend at least 30 min on each wheel. I also followed the temperature and curing times closely. I used 3 to 4 coats on each caliper. Within the week there where multiple large chips flaking off.
2,You get what you pay for,"Given the price this was an okay purchase. If I did it again I would spend a little more and get the g2 kit.ProsGreat red color.Easy to use. No mixing involved.ConsAs others have said, the included brush is terrible. I didn't finish a single caliper before it fell apart.After 1 month there is already at least one chip in the paint. I spent my time by taking the calipers off completely and cleaning them heavily so the paint would stick and there would be no dirt or grime. There is no reason they should be chipping already.I'm already planning to redo these this spring with a different brand of paint."
1,So-So product...,"Like many other have commented, (and I did not listen myself and totally regret it)... DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT use the brush that came with this product, it will come apart during use, and bristles will get stuck in the paint. Since paint dries extrememly fast, you will either have to leave the bristles in the paint, or pull them out leaving line impressions. The paint itself is not bad, but the whole brush thing makes this kind of a weak product. I am normally a big fan of dupli-color products, but this one was a let down."
2,Seems to be poor quality,"This Black & Decker CBM205 barely worked when it was new and quit entirely after about two months of daily service. While it was working, it was extremely slow in operation, as other reviewers have mentioned, taking minutes to grind enough beans for a pot of coffee. Add this grinder to your list of cheaply made, poor quality Made-in-China consumer products headed prematurely to the landfill."
2,great machine but makes powder,"I just bought this machine at Target and liked pretty much everything about it for an inexpensive piece.... easy to rinse container, easy to put beans in for grinding, and it grinds pretty quickly. The cons for it is that you have to hold down the button until it finishes grinding (not a big deal). It produces quite a bit of powder which is creating a bitter coffee. I am actually taking mine back as I do not enjoy bitter coffee. You can adjust the courseness of the bean grinding, but the very course seemed pretty fine to me with quite a bit of powder around the sides of the container that catches the grounds."
1,Does not work,"I really wanted this model to work. $24.95 at Target. Cheapest price for a burr grinder around. However, after 3 (!) that were all DOA's AND NEVER WORKED AT ALL, brand new out of the box, I gave up. Maybe this Target had a bad batch, but after three refunds I can't help but give it the lowest rating."
1,Much Worse Than a Blade Mill for Espresso,"It gets one star because it doesn't function as advertised. It grinds fine enough for drip, but not espresso. There is a fair amount of dust produced too, about the same amount as my blade mill when I shake it while grinding. Also, the collection container is made of brittle plastic that hold a nice static charge which makes pouring the grounds out difficult, and there is only a momentary power button that you need to hold down. Oh well, the price was too good to be true..."
2,"Black & Decker CBM205 Coffee Bean Mill, Stainless Steel","Hey all,For the price this may be an ok grinder. The problem as I see it, is that the beans will not fall down into the grinder on their own and you need to constantly shake the grinder to gets the beans to fall into the grinding element. Coffee also gets stuck in the space where the coffee transfers from the grinder to the storage container. Over all spend a little more and receive alot more. Would not buy again."
1,design is flawed,"This mill is seriously flawed because it jams up from all the dust it makes. After a month or so it clogged with coffee dust and the motor seized. I removed the twistoff cleaning plug from the loading funnel and tried to clean the chamber. I got some of it out but it is impossible to get most of it that way, and after a couple more runs it jammed again. The mill is defective by design as there is no way to disassemble it for cleaning. Save your thirty bucks!"
1,Might be from the makers of Italian cars,"Although it's just a B&D; product, this mill looks like they used pininfarina for the aesthetics. However, like many fine examples of Italian engineering this mill looks great and that is where the positive features end.Awkward and frustrating to use, the button must be held down, it blows coffee dust everywhere, it grinds inconsistently and clogs with even slightly oily beans. The receptacle is small, has a cheap and frustrating lid system and is made from a kind of plastic that coffee loves to stick to.Attractive form and nearly useless function. Much too frustrating to use before you've had your morning coffee!"
1,"Terrible, just Terrible!","I just have to add my review even thought it is a repeat of so many others. Here is a great, longer review that sounds exactly like the problems we've had:http://www.amazon.com/review/R19H8C1S856T69/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permFor the first month we had this (got it as a gift so at least it was free) it worked ""ok."" It creates a huge mess, though, and you spend as much time cleaning coffee grounds up off the counter as you do grinding coffee.After a month, though, it started smoking. This was the first time we ran into the grinder clogging up. It was so clogged that the grounds were a think, molasses type of mess. There's no easy way to get in to the bottom of the grinder to clean it up, but we managed after some struggle and mess. The very next use - it was all gummed and jammed up again! This thing is not easy to clean, does not work well, and has been very frustrating. Save your money and buy something else."
1,Inconsistent,"I was surprised to see reviews stating that the grind is too fine. With the one I received, the grind is very coarse even on the finest setting. I want it much finer than this grinder produces. It takes almost twice as much coffee to get a good cup.Inconsistent grind and DOA product for some folks. This is going back to the store and I won't be getting another one."
1,Useless for espresso,"This grinder looks nice for a low price, but it won't grind coffee fine enough for espresso. Plus, you have to hold the button down the entire time it's grinding."
1,Worthless. Avoid at all costs.,"Grinds are so coarse you could do better with a knife and cutting board. Fine grains shown on box are impossible to reproduce at home with this unit.Strangely, mine ground whole beans at a fairly decent medium-grain size when it first came out of the box, but the minute I adjusted the coarseness, all bets were off. From here, no matter what I did it spit out nearly-whole beans and nothing even resembling coffee grounds worthy of a drip coffee maker. I cleaned and adjusted thinking that there was no way that the out-of-the-box performance I first saw was a fluke, but it obviously was.Design of how the grounds are accessed is great (as opposed to many Cuisinarts that force you to flip over the entire unit and fight gravity), however the grinding mechanism is just terrible. Oh and the static problem many others have mentioned is a very noticeable nuisance.Bought it yesterday, will be returning it today. Back to the drawing board!"
2,Oily beans killed my unit!,"I got 3 good years out of this grinder, but there are more minuses than positives. It is consistent, easy to use and very inexpensive compared to many others. The immediate downside for me is that you have to hold the power button on; very noisy compared to others; and this unit is easily killed by fresh, oily beans. I have ground dozens of batches of inexpensive, store-bought beans with no problems. I did 3 batches of freshly, French roasted beans and the unit died. Cleaning & rescue proved to be too difficult to justify more hours, so it is headed for the junk pile! I have had a DeLonghi unit that's much easier to use and is twice as old and a smaller foot print, but i will have to beg to get it back. Using a blade grinder on the oily beans is my only choice now. Actually, I use a French press for brewing and a blade grinder is sufficient, imho."
3,"OK, not great",A quick read. The juxtaposition of Rayven's street talk and the stilted other-world talk was jarring. Sex scenes were okay - could have been a little more risky. Purple feather trees...
4,Something different,"I love the Antica Italia Aglio, Olio E Peperoncino pasta sauce! While it is delicious on pasta, at our house we love to add it to sandwiches like a condiment. It adds a terrific zing and turns a turkey and cheese sandwich into a gourmet treat!"
1,All heat,The product is all heat with not offsetting taste. Would not recommend unless you just like heat! Wanted to use the product with smoked olive oil to create a pleasant addition to pasta.
4,"Very strong flavors and heat but delicious if used sparingly, go easy on it","I received this product in a gift package from a friend. I see that it's used in pasta but I decided to use it for breakfast instead. Fried about 2tbsp of it up with onion and tomato, and then cracked eggs overtop and covered for about 5mins. Came out quite delicious, but be careful it's very spicy! I like heat so that's not a problem but for someone more sensitive use about 1/4 just for flavor (you can always add more at the end).Anyway, I would recommend it."
2,Disappointed with the plain language,"I read together with my 10 year old daughter while home-schooling. The story is touching and beautiful. It dealt with relation struggles and forgiveness at the end. However, I am very disappointed with the plain and simple language written in this version. I feel the writing is tasteless and boring. I wish I could get the original version. I would probably appreciate it more. Also, my daughter would learn better English."
3,Watch the sizing,"I bought these at the same time I bought a pair of Nike Basketball shoes.. both in size 12.5, I used the sizing guide on Eastbay to confirm the size I should buy. The Nike are a perfect fit, however these Adidas are way too small, and it is a very narrow shoe..The size is more like an 11 or 10.5, and the regular width is more like a narrow fit..Great looking shoe, very lightweight - just watch your sizing when you order this. I'd go at least a size larger, and a wide width if avaiable."
5,Gold Medal Says it All,"Harry Chapin was a superb entertainer as well as a human being to be honored & hopefully, emulated. This is a wonderful 2 disc collection of all of my old favorites as well as a number of songs new to me. I loved 'Taxi' & the other well known songs, but when I first heard 'A Better Place To Be"" I brok into tears & was hooked. When I lost one of my tapes, I was crushed. In trying to find a replacement, I came across this collection & had to add it to mine. I would definitely recommend it to any music lover."
2,A Representative Anthology,"Harry Chapin wrote story songs. They were often about folks who were frightened, disappointed, confused, lonely and sad. Being all these things when I was a lad, these songs spoke to me and I really enjoyed them and Mr. Chapin. In a fit of nostalgia I got ahold of this cd and was sorely disappointed.His lyrics are usually prolix, unfelicitous, stilted, and forced things that poorly serve the maudlin tales he wants to tell us. One of the worst is Mr. Tanner, the tale of a man who lives for his singing, but quits when someone says something mean to him. I sure do feel sorry for him, but not in the way that Chapin wants me to. I'd expect this sort of thing from a teenager, but not from a grown man -- Harry or Mr. Tanner. Aside from ""Cat's in the Cradle"" and ""Circle,"" most of his songs are dreadful.The music is ok at best, as is the singing.I liked the spoken tracks best, because these show Harry Chapin as the good man he was and his commitment to doing good things."
5,Absolutely Excellent,"This is some of Harry Chapin's best work. All good, no filler. Like many good musicians, he was taken from us too soon. He sang of feeling, life, love and emotions.I won't go over the meaning behind the songs, if you know Harry Chapin, you know what his songs are about. This is when music was music...."
4,just to straighten out the record straight...,adapter for compaq 3800 series and 3900 is being sold for nine dollars and ninety five cents at targus. fourteen bucks including shipping and handling. Someone wrote below he got three of them for free. they aren't doing it anymore.
5,Great addition to your Pocket PC,"This keyboard is great for taking notes on your Pocket PC. The layout is full sized, which is nice if you have big hands. The Key travel is similar to laptop keyboards, so it is not too unnatural.The unit itself is a mavel of engineering, folding up to a nice package only a little larger than the Pocket PC itself. The only complaint is it doesn't have enough support to sit on you lap directly. I've found if you have a legal pad or portfolio, it makes a nice platform for use on your lap.I would recommend downloading the latest drivers, especially if you are running a Pocket PC 2002 device, since the drivers on the included CD do not seem to work that well on the new OS.All-in-all, this item is well worth the purchase price if you find youself wanting to do more data entry on your Pocket PC, but can't seem to write fast enough."
4,Svette!,"Overall, very nice. Tactile feel is very good. My only gripe is it's actually larger than a standard keyboard (the keys are a bit larger which makes the overall length longer). So I find myself hitting the single quote key rather than the carriage return key."
4,Watch the connection,"I love this device but I had problems with the male connector that plugs into the Compaq. It was to ""snap"" in place, but it broke in place instead. Watch the flimsly connector! Otherwise, it's an absolute necessity to have for serious PDA users."
2,customer support,"I have one of the models called PA840, which is for the 3700 and earlier models. As the special note indicates, this will not work with 3800 or later models. I attempted to contact Targus several times, and called the them. The customer service rep was courteous, however they will NOT replace the adapter part for this model. You will be taking a chance if the product you buy is not compatable with what you have."
4,"Good Product, but has its problems","I used this to take notes in class, and it works perfectly good. It has full size keys and it is very simple to type with. How ever, i always had a problem of it popping open inside my back pack. The latch would never stay securely closed, and eventually it popped opened and one of the hinges broke so i had to cough up [money] for a new keyboard. Still, it is better than anything else, so i would buy it again."
4,A must if you own a Pocket PC,"I paid [$] for the Targus Keyboard almost a year ago and it was worth every penny. I take my Pocket PC to class with me and type my notes. It is great to have a PC and keyboard small enough to fit in your purse. The keyboard is sturdy, easy to use, and slightly smaller than a regular sized keyboard. Do not wait to purchase your keyboard. Purchase it the same time you buy your Pocket PC and it will make your electronic transition much smoother. You will be able to enter in all of your contacts, appointment, and other data, without having to do it with the stylus or waiting to sync it to your personal computer. Buy it now!"
3,A glossy study of the Roman legion,A rather glossy book that discusses the Roman legion from approx Hannibal to the fall of the Western Empire. To those that know something of Rome you will find little new or orginal in the book but it makes a good introduction on the subject as the writer clearly knows his topic.
4,Not Naughty Enough,"This was overall pretty well done, but not quite as spicy as I like. It was still worth reading and more exciting than some of the snoozers they have out. They just don't make them like Ann Rice anymore, do they? her 'Beauty' Trilogy is the best I have ever found. More recent is Nancy Madore's Enchanted, which is probably one of the best erotics I have seen lately."
5,Great quailty!,"These products are great. I have been using this set for over two years now and I haven't had any accidents or breakage yet. I love this pattern it seems to coordnate well with all different types of blues. I get complemented frequently on this pattern. It is solid, sturdy and good for everyday use."
3,slippery when wet,"These are elegant high quality glasses, but I feel they have a couple negatives to their design. Watch it when loading and unloading them in the dish washer as when they are bottom up, and/or wet, they are very hard to handle. They are also a little big for the small hand to hold. My husband with his large hands has no problem. I use two hands to hold them as they are almost to big for me. I prefered the Pfaltzgraff 20 oz. Maison blue glasses."
3,beautiful but hard to handle,"These glasses are the most gorgeous blue color and compliment the Summer Breeze series so beautifully. Unfortunately, their size and shape makes them awkward and hard to handle unless you have Shaq O'Neill hands!!!They are hard to load and unload in the dishwasher, having almost dropped them many times. I do not have small hands, medium to large actually for a lady.I do love the glasses just wish they were maybe a 12 ounce size."
5,Simpley Amazing,"This book not only gives you an insight on the Valley, but more importantly gives you an view on a new way of thinking about your job. Randy, helps you see that your job doesn't have to be a means to an end. But rather, your job/life should go hand in hand as you enjoy the journey of a lifetime. If you aren't enjoying your work or are missing the drive you once had this book will certainly be enjoyed. Kudos Randy on a job well done."
1,Should have been a magazine article instead,"Large type, small pages, and only 170 of them, yet it was still a stretch for this book. Better to have been an article in Fast Company. Poorly written, blindingly obvious insights (hint: if this book is interesting or new to you, you probably aren't the best person to do a startup). I'm amazed that HBS Press published this. Don't waste your time on this one...suggest Dee Hock's ""Birth of the Chaordic Age"" as a shining example of this sort of book done right."
1,Much Ado About the Obvious,"I found this book rather patronizing and shallow.Is it not obvious that if you follow your passions, your work will be more fulfilling and probably more successful? I don't find that a revelation that requires a riddle. Is his attack on the materialism of the get-rich entrepreneurs justified? Absolutely. Is the book worth the time to plow through his Socratic discussions with a character named Lenny? I don't think so. Randy Komisar should keep his day job, one I trust he does with passion."
3,Did you enjoy The Four Hour Work Week?,"If so, you might enjoy this one, too. The books seem quite similar to me. Both authors really seemed to want to let us know just how successful they have been. In both cases, it felt like the me-me-me was more than just a vehicle for the narrative or the business information.While I really agree with some of the main tenets of this book, it felt like the author really struggled to spit them out. It was hard for me to understand how the international flavor of the first chapter fit in with the rest of the book...which was ALL about Silicon Valley.The last point I'd make is that the book felt really dated. I read it just recently (Summer of 2011). I didn't notice a publication date or a revision date, but the content could stand to be refreshed."
4,A business book with heart,"The world of Silicon Valley start-ups is filled with insiders and outsiders, and Komisar is one of the few people who have been on both sides of the glass. He has celebrated high-profile victories, to be sure, but he has also eaten his share of humble pie under the glaring scrutiny of the media. This book reflects his dual perspective of hard-nosed realism about start-ups combined with compassion and support for the human beings (and dogs) who populate this complex world. Highly recommended for those thinking about joining this crazy rollercoaster ride."
4,A Great Read,"This is an easy read with a powerful message: don't forget about having passion for what you do each day. Too much focus on the bottom line is not going to cut it in the world of start ups. While the book might (to some) state the obvious, it is still a great reminder on keeping one's focus on people and passion instead of only looking at the financial aspects of business. Many business books are very dry reading -- not this one. It's a good book for the classroom at both the undergraduate and MBA levels as well."
4,Pirsig look out.,"This book combines a simple story, an interesting idea, some basic philosophy applicable to most working folk, and insight into a place and culture that has captured many people's attention. It is easy to read, insightful without being preachy, and fascinating for anyone who is interested in looking into the culture and workings of Silicon Valley a little bit deeper. The story is even entertaining and the characters believable and likeable."
5,Commerce meets spirit,"Fabulous, fabulous guide book in which Komisar blends the business of dot.com start-up's with the zen of life. Through his anecdotes, he suggests we could all benefit from understanding the difference between doing what you must and doing what you enjoy. His bottom line...""why wait?"" Therapeutic, inspiring and funny. This book will make you feel great."
5,Good things come in small packages!,"When I read the first few sentences, I wondered if the book would turn out to be one of those vacuous business parables that pop up periodically. But before the end of the first chapter, I was hooked. Much more than an entertaining insider look at Silicon deal-making--and it is surely that--the book is a cautionary tale about the dangers of deferring dreams, the importance of passion, and the power of community inherent in the best new business ventures. This book kept me up for a few nights, and I know it will keep me thinking about the meaning of my life for many more."
2,"""how to feel like working when you don't need to""","A brilliant guide to doing what you feel passionate about instead of what you need to do to pay the rent (mortgage) for those few who have enough money that they don't really need to work (ie, failure is acceptable and won't jeapardize them). This may have seemed a reasonable approach during the boom, but it's ridiculous during the bust, when being part of a sinking ship typically means being without a job for more than a year. Another relic of the era (80s & 90s boom)."
3,Recommended to me,This book was recommended to me while reading another book. It is very useful if you like business. I tell others who have great business ideas to read it first then get back to me.
3,Not Your Zen & The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance,The book did not take of or hold my interest as expected. Good reading for a beginner and some reminders for a savvy businessman but it does not seem to have the punch or the glue to hold it together.
2,Easy stance to take once you have made the money...,"Wow, all of Randy's words sound so good, thoughtful, and altruistic. Sure, what he says makes sense, AFTER you have already made it. Yes, it's EASY for him to say these things AFTER he has ALREADY made his KILLING doing it the OTHER way! I feel his pain, but hey, if he so believed in the message that he presents, he would have given away all that money that he made doing it the OTHER way. So are the words in this book sincere, or just a way to make more money? Not hard to figure out if you think about it. Get this book if you want to feel good about losing or need an excuse to run at 50% instead of 100% of your ability."
4,Enjoy the ride!,"An odd title for a business book, or rather a book about the business of life. I guess it is meant to hook you, draw you in, and much as the monk did, put your hand on the shoulder of the narrator and go for a ride. It is an easy ride with fun and laughter and serious business set in California. The fact that the stock euphoria has ended, that the internet bubble has burst, makes this all the more insightful. Randy Komisar is a native New Yorker who, while schooling in RI, gradually and eventually found his way to his current title of Virtual CEO in Silicon Valley. He did not start out heading this way. One connection led to another. One door closing led to another one opening. Patience and awareness of himself (his strengths, his opportunities) were his primary guides as he came to understand that ""When all is said and done, the journey itself is the reward"". Hop on and enjoy the ride!"
3,Metaphysical Capitalism,"Liked the author, enjoyed the insight into the world of venture capitalism but this book could have been an article in a magazine. It seemed to me like a long walk for a short pay-off. I get the point but felt like the author was purposely stringing you along for some bigger pay-off that did not happen."
3,A good easy read with a little philosophizing,"Not a bad book, but not something likely to leave a lasting impression, at least for me. The book is part memoir and part fable talking about how people need to spend their working lives involved in a life they are passionate about, rather than deferring their passions until after they retire (which he calls the deferred life plan). I agreed with the point coming into the book, and thus I am likely not someone expected to get a great deal out of it. Well Written."
4,Told you so,"This is an interesting book for a lot of the reasons mentioned by the other reviewers. What hit me is that for those in the dotcom meltdown, Komisar basically ""told you so"". His basic lessons are to do what you're passionate about and that you need more than the dream of getting rich to sustain your business. Those lessons aside, he also emphasizes the basics of business. In other words - if you're losing 10 cents on every widgit you sell, you can't make up for that by selling a million widgits. If you can't make a profit off of a small amount of revenue - why do you think you'll make a profit (later) off of projections of large revenues? Sure, it sounds obvious - so why did so many lose so much money. They did everything they could to deny the obvious. The business might be on the Internet, but the balance sheet still will be printed on paper - and so will the Chapter 11 filings.--- Mark"
2,Waiting for Something More,"This is probably one of the worst books I've ever finished. The first story of Randy and the Monk was interesting, and seemed to foreshadow something zen-like and remarkable to come, but it never arrived. After all the book is entitled the Monk and the Riddle; a title which connotes something profound, something very important. I guess the riddle to me is why I finished reading it if I thought it was such a terrible book.The writing style is accessible, and the themes seem to flow well. Despite that, I just couldn't find myself caring about the narrator, or the man he's supposed to mentor in the story. The whole message of the book simmers down to do what you'll love to do for your business, and you'll find a way to succeed. Certainly good advice, but the author didn't need 200 or so pages to make that point."
3,Highly enjoyable read,"This is one of the books that I can finish in a few days, very enjoyable, keeps you interested in what is going to happen next. As for the lessons learned, one thing I agree is, for everything you do and want to do extrememly well, you need to have passion, and have the view for long term success. I like the phrase.. The Journey is The Reward!"
5,Canciones De Mi Padre - fantastic!,This is truly an inspiring and stirring CD. It arrived in great shape and very promptly after I ordered it. I would highly recommend this seller to anyone wishing a great deal and great service.
2,Mediocre,"Kudos for her as an artist to make a difficult cross-over from Pop to Mariachi. However, the arrangements aren't innovative, she chose some questionable songs, as a singer she lacks good phrasing in Spanish,and her voice is monotonous (her voice has only one color, and she doesn't present us with meaningful volume contrasts)."
1,Canciones de Mi Padre,"I was very disappointed in the 2 CD's I bought. Linda is in the background, her songs are muffled and words cannot be heard. In the foreground is a loud guitar which overtrumps the whole music. I wished I could return the CD, it was not worth the money. I had a previous casette by her, which I lost and I wanted to replace it. What a disappointment."
1,Awful,"For 30 years Ronstadt has made a career of destroying the worst of Pop. American pop, Country pop, Mexican pop - it matters not. This is just another of these trite and awful recordings.I'm going to listen to some Lila Downs and Chavela Vargas to hear how wonderful Latin music can sound."
3,OK,Songs are not as familiar as standard mariachi but how can you miss that beautiful voice and the liner notes are interesting.
5,excelent,"Linda Rondstat's ""canciones de mi padre""was excelent her voice is so clear, she has a a beautiful gift from god.her voice is like velvet smooth.and the songs first class, they make you fly in your dreams of memories from the past you think you have died and went o heaven with this music and the writing of the music and the words hit right in the heart you can listen and listen and not get bored this is music at it's best not like today this is the crown jewels of music writing also I might note that on number 11 of the preview is mispelled it says 2 abolitos and it should say 2 ARBOLITOS I strongly recomend this album"
5,Passionate music,"Songs of pain and reflection, with a pure clear voice that's a joy to experience. Ronstadt pays excellent tribute to the world of Mexican music. Ronstadt was considered one of the world's best singers in the authoritative book ''Billboard Guide to Tejano and regional Mexican Music,'' and this CD is proof of that. Great stuff, highly addictive."
5,Ronstadt at her best.,Ronstadt sings these very difficult classical Canciones like the professional that she is. I highly reccomend this album to fans of beautiful Mexican music.
5,Essence of Mexico,"Linda Ronstadt does an excellent job in capturing the essence of Mexico. Being of partial Mexican origin myself, and having traveled south of the border many times; I could see in my mind images of Old Mexico...very traditional and very outstanding.Other Spanish language artists used for comparison: Lola Betran, Nat ""King"" Cole, Nana Mouskouri, Vinciente Fernandez, Juan Gabriel, Ana Gabriel."
5,Wonderful !!,"This is THE BEST! I have ordered the video also and let me tell you, the costumes and talent can not be discribed. I Gaurantee GOOSEBUMPS, TEARS , AND GRITAS ! You have to join in-you become involved--I recommend this to ALL. I have given it as gifts many times."
3,"Pretty hard, but with exceptions","This is definitely a dark, edgy, somewhat overdriven album, and for that I like it. The bass is deep, the synths are ominous and the drums are pitched down and heavey. Overall, I have to say that the Panacea tracks are my favorite because the Cavito stuff edges a little too far toward rave/house for my taste. The only real problem is that the tracks on this album are a little formulaic, consisting of the same break and a chopped amen throughout, and the happy hardcore breakdown in the middle of King of the Jungle was enough to have me hitting the eject button. Overall, though, it's an ok record with a few good tracks to snag for a mix."
4,Crafty Pop in an Uncle Sam Hat,"Another fine collection of Richard Davies songs. This album continues his progression toward a more traditional pop sound and song structure. However, there is still much nuance and charm, but nothing like the artsy Cardinal album or his first solo album ""There's Never Been a Crowd Like This"".One thing I don't understand is the cover art and album title. The cover depicts an Uncle Sam hat with the album title below it: ""Barbarians"". It seems strange that a young man would leave his native Australia to come live in a country he felt to be barbaric. Perhaps he had something else in mind(?). Whatever...bottom line is that this album is certainly no disappointment, and a worthy addition to your Davies collection."
2,Indie folk-pop,"Unfortunately, compared to Crowd, Barbarians sounds like a group of songs recorded quickly, before their possibilities were fully explored and exploited. The songwriting is still there, but the extra care and refinement that made Crowd so rewarding has been replaced by a more one-dimensional sound: changing electric guitars, fewer counter melodies, harmonies that teeter, and simpler, more staid rock arrangements."
1,Crushingly Boring,"Old worn-out sound. Waste of money. As another critic wrote, the montage of word and motif for the album cover is Un-American. Very '60s and British sounding. Buy it for your Mum."
3,The A3 size is frustrating in the US,Great print results BUT the 11.7 x 16.5 size which is a common size overseas makes it impossible to find a decent portfolio or even affordable sheet protectors. Currently Amazon has one set of A3 protectors selling at 25 for a 10 pack. That's nuts. Your only option then is to cut the paper (not always a clean result with luster) or buy an oversized book that leaves your prints swimming.
5,good quality,they allways have a good quality and i wish i could buy more for the price i pay for it!
2,Disappointed,"My daughter has had to wear bibs all day everyday since about 4 or 5 months, (she is now 7 months) because she drools so much. I was very excited to see these bibs and the good reviews on them, and wanted solid colors........but turns out the waterproof core it has does not work. Her shirts were still getting wet after just a few hours. She does drool a lot, so maybe they'd be good for a light drooler, but now I'm gonna go back to Walmart and get the 10 pack of solid bibs with the plastic back for $10 since they should do the trick better..."
3,OK,"Wanted to love these as our baby girl is teething and a total drool monster. However, they get soaked through pretty quickly and are pretty flimsy. But, they're cheap - so thumbs up as a backup."
5,Sturdy!,"As far as I can tell after 3 months of use, these are great bibs. Simple, strong velcro, don't fray in the wash. Just be sure to attach the velcro before washing :)"
5,Love them!!,"My daughter has reflux, and so she spits up quite a bit. These bibs are wonderful, and the spit up does not soak through. The only time her outfit gets wet is if the spit up runs under the neck area of the bib. They also wash well and can be dried on low heat in our dryer!"
2,The BAD velcro,"These bibs have the BAD plastic velcro that tears up baby's skin and reeks havoc in the laundry. The colors of these terry bibs are nice, so it's a shame these aren't made with the soft baby friendly velcro I've found on many other bibs. I quickly stopped using these."
1,Disappointed,"I really wanted to like these bibs. I was willing to get over the fact that they are quite thin and not completely waterproof since they are more eco-friendly, but then the velcro started irritating my baby's neck. I prefer Carter's bibs--they also use velcro, but it is not at all abrasive and the material is a little thicker. More expensive but I guess you get what you pay for! I would definitely not recommend these bibs!"
3,Not really waterproof.,"These bibs are ok. My daughter is a drooling machine. She can soak one of these through her clothing in an hour, no problem. I do not understand how they are waterproof. That said, I'm not willing to use vinyl or something like that on her, so we just change these constantly."
5,"Great bibs, especially for droolers!",We used these bibs exclusively as drool absorbers. There are many great colors to match any of my daughter's outfits and they kept her dry.
4,Better than regular bibs,"I bought these a while ago for my daughter, and they are definitely better than a regular bib. They're double layered, so they do provide better wetness protection. However, my daughter still drooled through them. You will still need to change bibs, but not as often. The colors are great! They wash really well and the velcro is nice - stays put and doesn't snag everything else in the wash. We're done using them not, but they were nice while we needed them!"
5,Best bib set ever,"I like these so much that I'm thinking of ordering another set. She is at the teething/drooling stage, but not out of the spit up stage either, so these bibs have already saved many outfits from getting ruined. It's much easier to keep changing bibs than outfits every time. And they keep the outfit from getting wet which is great. Also, the colors are perfect, they coordinate easily with man of her outfits so they look adorable. I also like how they are larger than most bibs, meaning they are perfect for her stage right now. I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend these. I do wash them and dry on medium low though after reading other reviews, and they are holding up great so far."
2,Didn't do the trick,"My darling baby has severe acid reflux and spits up a lot. I've searched high and low for a bib that could hold up to her spit up power. I had hoped these would do the trick but I found them only slightly for useful than a regular bib. If you baby is a light to moderate spitter upper these might work, but for heavy duty spit up....these were of no use at all. Even out daycare asked us to find something better because these did not do the trick."
3,Too big for a 5 month old,The description didnt really state that these aren't your average size bibs. They are huge. So basically they are too big for my 5 month old. There is a hug gap between her neck and the bib so they dont serve the purpose. I guess I have to wait for her to be much older to use these. I wish they have been more clear on the size that way I wouldnt have wasted my time ordereing these.
1,"One dollar more for ""GIRLS"" bibs?????","They're fine bibs. Great. It's 2013. Why are the ""boys"" bibs $13.99, and the ""girls"" bibs one dollar more? You must be kidding me. Instead of paying the extra dollar OR the cheaper price for the ""boys"" bibs, I'll just buy them elsewhere, thanks."
2,Not Waterproof and Extremely Thin,"I was looking for bibs with the waterproof liner because my baby is a big drooler and she also spits up quite a bit. I was excited to find these bibs because there was a variety of colors that would match her outfits and keep them dry.The bibs are extremely thin! My baby drooled through one of the bibs in less than 3 hours. The whole thing was soaking wet, and it wet through to her clothes. To me, it does not seem as though there is a waterproof liner present at all.I gave these bibs 2 stars just because of the colors. Other than that, if you're looking for a true waterproof bib, these are NOT the ones to buy!"
1,"Good price, but VERY thin","I thought these bibs would be great for my daughter since I was looking for a value pack of solid colors. Unfortunately, they are incredibly thin. When I read that the boys' version of these bibs were thin, I STILL didn't imagine they would be as thin as they are.The only slight positive is that the size is okay for my 11-week-old daughter. I bought a value pack of solid color feeder bibs as well (different brand) and they are just too big for her right now.I would NOT recommend these."
5,Very good first attempt.,I just got this album the other day and I was very surprised at the level of talent these guys bring to the table. if you are fans of Avenged Sevenfold and Atreyu you will feel right at home listening to Bullet for my Valentine on your Zune. It's nice to see a young band with tons of talent and upside in this genre for a change. I'm really looking forward to picking up their brand new album this week!
4,"Heavy duty, classic bag with modern features.","Very nice, substantial cart bag available for a steal on Amazon. Full of high quality touches. Comfortable with plenty of pockets for gear - even a pair of shoes. The ""great divider"" system for you clubs keeps them separated top to bottom. This is a heavy bag and I wouldn't want to carry this guy on my back through a full round, but then I bought it to use with a BagBoy pull cart. Doesn't sit perfectly in my cart, but that is as much about the cart as it is the bag. If you want a classic style bag without company logos all over it, this is an excellent choice."
2,Beautiful but not durable,"I bought for my girlfriend, and she liked it because it was simple and beautiful. But after few days of using, the stone fell out. I wish they made this more durable."
2,"Exactly, exactly, exactly like the movie",A poorly written book that follows the movie exactly. I was hoping for some insight into the characters or extra scenes that would enhance the movie (which I LOVED) but was very disappointed. Not even worth the read if you haven't seen the movie.
1,Terrible,"Not only is this book badly written, it is quite unlike the actual movie. The knights are out of character, the dialogue is boring, and the beginning of the movie is changed completely. Bors speaks like an educated man, while Tristan and Dagonet tease each other about who has had more women. The movie was amazing, but the book is terrible."
1,awful,"I loved the movie, but this was not nearly as good. How can a book be so bad when the movie the book is based on is so good?Clive Owen did such a good job as our hero, yer in the book, the character falls flat.iTunes has this book under audio books but plz dont waste the $25 to listen to it. Spend the $0.10 to read it and THEN throw up.All the hard work is done! Im glad I only spent $0.10 on it. Anyone want to buy my copy?"
3,EXCITING NOVELIZATION OF THE HIT MOVIE,"Frank Thompson's adaptation of KING ARTHUR is a more than worthy complement to its cinematic inspiration. Characterization, plot, and atmosphere are all at least as well realized by Thompson's pen as they are in the film, and the author excels with the action scenes, infusing them with a nearly-tangible clash of steel, sinew, and bone. Lancelot's character is particularly better realized as compared to the film, and the relationship between he, Arthur, and Guinevere significantly fleshed out. As portrayed in the source movie, the Church of the day does not represent Christianity well, but the novel's Arthur is if anything more devout (the knights all remain thoroughly pagan). Historical inaccuracies are not really an issue--this is adventure, not history. Certainly not on par with the works of Malory, Tennyson, or White, but a worthy reimagining of the timeless legend, nonetheless."
2,Way too many battle scenes!,"I was excited about reading this book, but it ended up being very disappointing. The story got off to a good start, but ended up going nowhere. There were way too many battle scenes and not enought development of character or plot. You ended up not caring much about the characters because you hardly knew them! Overall, I think the story had a lot of potential, but ended up being shallow and basically only battle scenes."
5,All things distorted.,"Live at the Paradiso is Soft Machine at their best! It captures what they were on stage, live. Keyboards, bass, vocals are all distorted. Keyboards careen out of control, playing at a frenetic pace. This is just an outstanding album from the Progressive Rock years. Live at the Paradiso is loud, raw, and straight out of the amps. This is my top pick from the Soft Machine catalog."
5,A lovely book,"Its a lovely children story which helps children to understand about how babies and humanity generally come to life, written and designed in an attractive and enjoyable style. I recommend this book to all parents in helping their children clear out this issue to them in a very understandable and enjoyable way."
3,OK,They provide good knee protection but one of the pads ripped after only a few practices (use for roller derby). For the cost I expected better quality.
4,fast shipping,So these knee pads were recommended to me by a derby teammate. She loves them and had knee problems until she used them. Everyone is different with the gear they like. I tried these pads at practice and my knees were black & blue by the end of the 3 hours. I'm sticking to my 187s for practice and I'll use these at the rink to protect me from accidental mishaps.
5,Picture misleading,"Nice, well varnished handle but the picture is just of the tip or shovel end. The handle is solid and of a good diameter, better than many."
3,:0),I am only rating Moon Lust by Sherri L king reason being that was the only story i read that's why i gave it 3 stars i would give it 5 but i'm not rating the rest of the stories i bought moon lust separate on ellora's cave. any way i loved moon lust its a short story but i got so much from that short read you would think its a full length novel.
3,Hot & Spicey,"it is a good collection of stories, Each one unique and kept my interest. The characters were fairly strong. nice and spicy gets you all in a lather."
2,Not what I expected,"Michael Connelly is a fine author. He has stories to tell, and he tells them well. I have most of his books, and will no doubt continue buying them.This one, sad to say, did not please me.This is the true-crime version of a Dave Barry book, a collection of previously written columns / stories from the author's days as a reporter, in South Florida and in Los Angeles. The stories are all well written; footnotes bring us up to date (whenever possible) on what has transpired in each case in the 15 - 20 years since they first appeared in print.But Lord, is it dry! If I wanted to spend a few hours reading a newspaper, I'd buy the NYTimes.Part of the problem is that many chapters consist of multiple stories, written a few weeks / months / years apart. Each subsequent story had to reiterate the important facts, so there is a *lot* of repetition.I'm not sorry I read it; I just wish I had waited for the paperback."
1,crime beat,I have read every book by Michael Connelly and enjoyed them all so I decided to buy the true crime book that he had written. I have to say that i was most disappointed with it and find it difficult to believe that the fictional books and this true crime book were written by one and the same person. There was too much repetition in each and every story and not at all what I would have expected from the author.Tom Ahern.
4,A journey to the Authors career,This anthology of crime cases in Florida and L.A. shows the base from which the author worked to assemble his great series of crime novels. He has a gift if remembering or creating detail that show in this non-fiction work
1,Save your money AND your time!,"love, love, love all michael connelly books except ""closers"" (weak) but gave up on this fast! it reads like a 7th grade report. did someone else ghostwrite all the good ones?"
2,Like watching a clip show,"Ever tune into a TV show and the producers regurgitate a show made of clips from past shows? Welcome to Crime Beat.I bought this as a used paperback for a buck so I'm not complaining. The intro Connelly wrote was worth that. As M&M; said in their one star review, the intro was great and the rest was just a compilation of newspaper columns. As people don't buy a paper every day, each column goes back and covers ground in all the previous columns. Tedious stuff to wade through.I was expecting something like David Simon's 'Homicide,A Year on the Killing Streets. Nope, not even close. Connelly got lazy on this and man, it shows."
2,Slow,It is difficult to get through the endless details of the book.. I appreciate the subject matter but would like something that keeps me interest a little better.
2,Sometimes a little effort would be nice...,"Like Scott Adams' constant rehashing of old Dilbert strips, Connelly tries to get away with one here and the only ones to suffer are his fans. Taking old stories from his newspaper and collecting them without any attempt to follow-up, discuss the cases from a new perspective, or at least try to add something to mix is disrespectful to the readers that support his fiction. The only thing that keeps it from a one star for me is at least the cases were interesting and he's a good reporter, but with a little effort this could have been something much better."
3,Not Very Exciting,"Most crime stories take a single major crime or serial criminal and dig into it in depth, or to a lesser extent, do so with perhaps 5-6 situations. Connelly, however, overdoes it with 22 short vignettes about various crimes, killers, and cases. The material is almost entirely previously printed news stories, though the ""good news"" is that when several were written on a single case they are all included together. (The other ""bad news"" is that this also leads to some repetition, and it was originally copywrited in 2004 - ""old news."")Bottom Line: A fast read, but too superficial and not very exciting."
1,What a Rip Off,"I have read every single Connelly book - and loved each one - and was really looking forward to this one.So what it is, essentially is a collection of old newspaper articles he wrote (along with others) from his Florida and Los Angeles crime reporter days. By old I mean 1984-92.Not only that, it's a reprint of a book published earlier in 2004!No reflective insight to speak of; dull, repetitive passages; stilted newspaper writing, uninteresting politics. Major bore.I can't believe he stooped to this as a means of squeezing a few bucks out of loyal fans. What a travesty."
1,It's a fake book!,"Michael Connelly is truly a great author. This book is a disgrace. He has done nothing more than paste together his scrapbook of newspaper articles on crimes. Sadly, because the articles repeat each time all of the details of the crimes, the repitition will drive you nuts!Worse yet the articles aren't updated, so when he say that somnethiong occurs last year, but the article is dated 1991 he means 1990. The reader is totally misled. The book is a sham playing on his good name; now tarnished."
2,Exremely repetitive,"I checked the audio book out from the library. Couldn't get through it. After the 3rd CD, I returned it. The same information is repeated over and over and over and over.....for a second I thought my CD player was repeating the same tracks. Incredibly dull and annoying to hear the same articles about the same cases again and again with the same information and descriptions. How this got passed the editors, I have no idea.Unless you want to be bored to tears, skip this one."
2,Save Your Money and Your Time.,"The flap description had me intrigued, as I have loved to read all things Connelly. I expected more of an analysis of his experiences and how they formed his work. The ""Telling high school yearbook caption"" was simply a reprint of the caption. Not anything more, not more about who the person was, etc. This is literally a reprint of newspaper articles, and each one repeats much of what the previous handful on each subject had said. A disappointment. Move on."
1,What was this supposed to be?,"I've read everything Michael Connelly has written. I'm a huge fan. What was this? Apparently all the news articles he wrote as a reporter organized by criminal into chapters. The result is unending repetition of the facts, as newspaper articles are wont to do. When you're reading one article a day, that's fine. But when you're reading the articles in succession, it definitely is not fine."
1,Save your money,"Don't waste your hard-earned cash on this one, folks. If you are a true fan of Michael Connelly (and I am-every single book!), you will be sorely disappointed. I bought this book from behind the counter based on his fine reputation. Had I realized that it was a collection of news stories, restricted in column inches and imagination, it would not have been purchased. This is a mish-mash masquerading as relevant work. It is nothing more than his ""string book"" as a cub crime reporter two decades ago. His publisher must have pressured him for something fast, as this was poorly conceived. I couldn't even finish it."
1,Rip-off by Connelly and publisher,"I bought this book expecting a ""riveting collection of true stories that inspired and informed his novels"". Instead, only his introduction is new; for the rest, we get a re-print of some articles he wrote for the ""LA Times"" and the ""South Florida Sun-Sentinel."" And nowhere is this mentioned on the cover or the back of the book.I felt cheated. If only he had used those old articles to put some new perspective on them and the way they've influenced his crime-novels.Instead, we get this (not cheap) rip-off, intended to provide Connelly and his publisher with a quick buck. Sad things is, I wished I could only blame the publisher (from them we can expect things like this) but that Connelly would go along with this... Shame on you, Connelly!So, people, DON'T BUY THIS! Limit yourself to his crime-novels! Those at least are a lot of bang for your buck."
1,Skip It!,This book is just a publishing company's way of milking the fans of a gifted writer. I am so glad I checked this book out at the library. Disappointing.
1,BORING!,"The stories picked for this book are not at all interesting. On top of that the stories consist of nothing more than newspaper articles. Each article is printed in it's entirety, which means each article rehashes the same information disclosed in previous articles. No thought at all by the author went into this project. One of very few books that I had to stop reading because it was a complete waste of time."
1,garbage,This is a complete waste of time. Mr. connelly should stick to his great novels and not con us with this junk!
3,After two years glaze cracking...,"We bought Pfaltzgraff Ocean Breeze to match our remodeled summerhome kitchen. We love the pieces, but after two years of only seasonal use, the glaze on the plates is cracking. Everything else looks great, so we will buy another brand of plates to match the set. We thought with Pfalzgraff's reputation these dishes would be more durable!Pfaltzgraff should stand behind thier product and replace defective dishes...like in a recall..."
2,Unstable rack,"Although the shoe rack fits the space I had for it well and serves it's purpose, it is poorly made and doesn't hold together very well. The poles are hard to fit into the plastic end-pieces and often fall out, causing one or more shelves to collapse. I ended up duct-taping all the poles into their sockets, which helped some, but if any one slips out the whole thing will come apart. You also have to really pound the poles into the end-pieces to get them to be equal lengths, or the whole shelf wobbles. If you want a quick, cheap shoe solution, this probably will work, but you'll have to keep putting it back together and it won't last very long."
2,Not quite sure what to think...,"This shoe rack is a good size, where it fits inside my front entrance closet nicely to hide all our shoes. The downside is you hammer the pieces together without screws or glue, so the bars fall out easily. Not as secure as I had hoped. Holds a decent amount of shoes, not sure if you can get 30 pairs of adult shoes...but for now its helping me stay organzed."
1,shoe rack,"I have this shoe rack and it was not easy to assemble as advertised on the box. It says 'no tools required' but it only worked with a hammer and even then, it has collapsed at least 3 times since we assembled it.Not the best buy!"
3,Cheaply Made but Functional,The rack is very lightweight plastic supports with metal tubing rungs. Assembly has to be done with it lying on it's side starting with the base and working up inserting the metal tubes and then pressing the supports together because the plastic is very flimsy and will fall apart otherwise. Once assembled it's structure is very rigid. It's cheap but fits a space I have and it will get a lot of shoes off the floor.
2,30 pairs? r u kidding me?,"If you put some boots on it, you have to worry about the weight.This shoe shelf may fall down if your shoes are too heavy.And you can never put 30 pairs on it unless shoes for child.Don't waste your money. Go find another one!"
3,"Fair, but not great...","This particular product is definately one of the more hearty of the cheaper shoe racks out there. However, if you are concidering both form and function, you certainly won't get the form. If you are concidering placing the shoe rack out in the open instead of tucking it away in a closet then I would concider purchasing another type of shoe rack-perhaps a wooden or metal one. This one just doesn't have the look and seems as if (though relatively strong for a cheaper shoe rack) it will probably break down within a few years or so simply due to normal wear and tear."
2,Cheap shelving would work better,It was easy to assemble. It does hold shoe boxes...for a month before it collapsed.
2,not as good as I hoped for.,"My first review raved about this item, but after just 6 months, the darn thing has bent to the side and is now unusable. I would only recommend this if you plan to bolt it to the wall."
5,Works great and is sturdy!,"The product is quite sturdy if assembled as directed. The assembly instructions are very detailed and have a lot of step-by-step photos. The unit was a bit too wide for the space I had, but the metal rods were easily cut with a hack saw, then the ends dimpled with a large screw driver and hammer - just like the factory-made ends. Now fits perfectly!Very well designed, easily assembled, sturdy, and works as expected."
2,Not sturdy,"Got this together pretty easily using the hammer as instructed. Put all the shoes on it and went to slide it in place when a few poles fell and the whole thing collapsed and I had shoes everywhere. The poles don't seem to fit right into the holes even with the use of a hammer. Had it stayed together, it would have been great but I think it would be wise to invest a little more money into a sturdier model."
1,What a rip off...........so flimsy and a piece of jun k,I was very excited about organizing shoes in our garage.Lynk 1459014 30-Pair Shoe RackI went to put it together and the rods are so flimsy they won't stay in the plastic holes. It won't even stand up straight. There is no way you could put 30 pairs of shoes on this cheap rack. I'm now in the process of trying to use monster glue to keep it together. My husband told me to just throw it away. With shipping it was $40.00 and a total waste of money. DO NOT BUY THIS SHOE RACK!
2,Too high/Unstable,"This 50-Pair Shoe Rack unit is too high and the design is unstable; it ""rocks"" and ""sways"". Every time a pair of shoes are removed or exchanged the unit moves too much. My unit was fully loaded and collapsed when no one was around it. The company was very good about accepting a return of this unit."
1,Piece of crap!,"I followed the instructions EXACTLY, and mine wouldn't stand up straight, either. When I put shoes on it, it leaned even more, to the point where I was fearing its collapse. Sure enough, within just a few months, it came crashing down when no one was even in the room with it. I did not put too many shoes on the rack, nor did I assemble it incorrectly. I did not do anything that could've contributed to the rack's destruction, other than buying it and using it as it was meant to be used. This product is a piece of junk, and I would not be surprised if the user who gave it a good review works for the company that makes it."
4,Does the job,"The shoe rack was easy to put together. Ofcurse you need a hammer and a hard place and maybe a guy to finish the job but it was still easy. I have been using it and I move it around in my closet and it hasn't dismantal, like others do as soon as you touch them. All my shoes, boots, sandals, high heels fit perfectly."
1,piece of trash,"took it straight to curb for trash collector. could barely support it's own weight, much less a few pair of shoes"
1,"bad quality, break after two weeks","First it is very difficult to set it up and it is not stable. After two weeks, it breaks apart and no longer useable. Bad quality for this price. DO NOT BUY."
5,Great,The shoe rack was easy to put together and worth the price. It is lightweight and easy to move if I needed to.
1,Collapsed after 18 months,"I bought this rack in November 2010. I was pleased with it at first, but a few weeks ago (May 2012), I noticed it starting to bend to one side. After that, it became increasingly unstable, and then collapsed totally, spilling shoes all over the floor. We put it back together, but it soon collapsed again. I am replacing it with a much sturdier one. This one was much cheaper, but you get what you pay for."
2,Deceptive Picture,"I have the exact same item, just didn't buy it from Amazon. The picture makes it look like it holds tons of shoes- it will if they are kids shoes, or very narrow, small sized shoes. Myself, a woman's size 11, and fiance, men's size 9, our shoes are probably bigger than average. This rack will only comfortably hold 2 pairs across. You could squeeze in a third pair of say, sandals, if you stack them on top of one another. It is pretty cheaply made- snap together plastic. But it did fill an immediate need I had for shoe storage. And $36 is not the best price- I bought mine for $24, and ebay has these sometimes in the $20 price range."
1,Super FLIMSY :(,"I wanted it to work....but it's already fallen down twice. I think for the price though, this day and age, one could expect a little better quality."
1,crap product,don't waste your money. its not sturdy at all...keep searching for a better product because this isn't the one for you.
1,Horrible purchase!,Don't buy this rack. It fell apart after 2 days. I even resorted to using a hammer to try to pound the corner so it would stop coming apart. Complete waste of money and time.
5,Waylon Live: The Expanded Edition [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMAST,"This recording takes ou back to a time when Waylon was at the pinacle of his career. Even todays country music cannot stand up to the powerfull energy this live album contains. I am a lifetime Waylon fan, if your not, or never heard Waylon, this is as energetic as it gets. Buy it, and love it."
5,Best Live Album - Bar None,"Waylon is too good to ramble on about, especially live. I can't sing, but I can't stop myself from singing a hacked up harmony when playing this CD. You don't have enough Waylon if you don't have this set, it's prime-time Outlaw. It will PUMP YOU UP! Get this and ""Honky Tonk Heroes"" and you've got Waylon's best.I was 15 when I first heard the original 10 set abbreviated version of ""Waylon Live"" coming out of my sister's V.W. Bug 8 track tape player. Normally I wouldn't be caught dead in that car .... but I simply had to listen to the best music I had ever heard - and that says a lot for a boy who grew up listening to Johnny Cash singles. It wasn't until I was 45 that I found this 42 set double CD version - best buy ever!You will LOVE ""Waylon Live (Expanded Edition),"" I guarantee it! - Steve -"
3,Pretty Tame For An Outlaw Album,"I've had this one since it came out in it's original version in the '70's. As music, it isn't bad, but it doesn't have the ""bite"" or edge I would expect from an ""outlaw country"" album. Certainly not what I would consider raucous or rowdy. In fact, it's fairly laidback. Compare this with Shaver's UNSHAVEN:LIVE cd to see what I mean. To me, that one is the standard for all outlaw albums. (For those who don't know, it was Billy Joe Shaver who wrote Waylon's HONKYTONK HEROES album, considered the first outlaw album.)"
5,PRIME WAYLON WITH AWESOME RE-MASTERING,"Waylon at his best!!! Lots of energy lacking in his studio recordings. Country rock, or outlaw music as it was called in 1976, doesn't get any better than this! This tells it all. HIGHLY recommend."
3,Buddah Ain't No God in Mexico,"The music on this album is invaluable; it's one of Waylon's best. However, the sound quality is substandard. Considering that it has been vigorously remastered, one might think that it should sound great, instead, it's awful. Either the original source mics were too close or the input was too high during the recording, because there is crackling in the mid and high frequencies. Live CD sound doesn't have to be perfect, it just doesn't have to sound like an AM radio in a 71 Ford pick-up truck. Try Honky Heroes, the material is just as good and there are no engineering problems."
5,Waylon is---,just the best.This CD/DVD is a beautiful thing. Still singing like he has two sets of balls. He is missed. Justin
2,director's nightmare,"this is an extremely funny, extremely bizarre play(durang), but it's also a one-act witha propr list a page long and twelve scenes. i had ordered this with the intention of directig it but thought twice after the first three pages. It's good Durang though...just don't order this with the pretense of ""it's just a one-act."" This is a small production"
1,Bad product,"Was torn after first use. Do not recommend to anyone, Size is too small and therefore useless. hope no ene will make same mistake as a I and don't buy this one"
4,Aussie's that Whisk Us Back to What Was Good in Music,"From Smother Magazine www.smother.net:Bringing Brit-pop and smashing into R&B; flavored electronica ala Jamiroquai, The Wildlife sway their heads back and wail. Catchy with funneled pop hooks, ""Sweet Plastic"" has nifty beats and a lo-fi vibe. Dance rock has been taken to the headlines with acts like The Killers but I dare say The Wildlife make it challenging and more poignant. The album was produced by Alex Newport whose past work has included such luminaries and groundbreaking acts like The Mars Volta, System of a Down, and Erase Errata. Not many bands have this much soul delivering it with contagious effectiveness and with a sense of urgent need to rock out with your hair down."
4,The End of the Eighties,"This album pretty much defines my freshman year in college. I was very into the ""new"" YES and bought it out of curiosity. I was not disappointed. Trevor Rabin is supremely talented. After listening to songs such as Cover Up, and Eyes of Love showed me what Rabin contributed to Big Generator and 90125. Sorrow had an interesting South African rhythm. It was the instrumentals though that hooked me.Etoile Noir, Sludge, and The Cape really proved Trevor Rabin's talent to me. I enjoyed his talent for composition and instrumentation. Truly amazing!My only complaint is that there is now a definite ""80's"" sound lurking through some of these songs. It is not enough to distract from my enjoyment, but that might be nostalgia. Thus, I have given this CD 4 out of 5 stars to err on the side of caution."
3,Air-guitarists paradise....,"Trevor Rabin was the guitarist (& co-song writer) in Yes for some years, at the time of their most rock-focused period to date. The powerful sound he gave Yes is evident here, especially in the superb title track.He plays all instruments (except drums) with a sickening virtuosity, but it is with the guitar that he really shines. Screaming solos and synchopated riffs aplenty, this album is a great demonstration of a polished rock-guitarist in full flow.At times it seems as if he's leaving the rest of us behind and disappearing into an airbrushed-world of mountain-top guitar-posing, but the stand-out tracks (the stunning ""Can't look away"", ""Something to hold on to"" and ""Eyes of love"") make up for the hint of pretension.His soundtrack work is pretty good too (Armageddon & Enemy of the State, Con-Air are but three...)"
3,Contains some good material.,"Can't Look Away is a pretty good album from Trevor Rabin. This is actually the only solo album that I have from him. I've always liked the work that he has done with Yes. Trevor Rabin plays all of the instruments on this album except for the drums (that's really impressive). The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are satisfying. Trevor Rabin does well with the vocal duties, too. The album also sports nice backing vocals. The songs have a progressive pop feel to them. The guitar and keyboard work is talented. Alan White (from Yes) helps with the drums on a couple of tracks. The songs that I like the most are ""I Can't Look Away"" and ""Something to Hold on to."" This album is worth a listen."
2,Trevor is most definetly not the man,"After some pretty cool guitar riffs to lead into CAN""T LOOK AWAY, the musik becomes contrived and confused. His high falsetto vocals are mediocre and the songs have nothing to say and take forever to say it. The lyrics are cliche and add nothing to these tracks. Throughout the CD I wished this was an instrumental release. The guitar playing is OK and only hints at what might have been. The compositions are complex, but do not benefit from this complexity. I am sure RABIN is a very good guitarist, but apart from a couple of sterling moments, he seems throttled by the need to be obtuse and clever. Yet the cleverness never rises above sounding pretentious."
2,Weak followup to Yes work,"Yes, it does have some of the feel of Yes' 90125. However, it is more like a Muzak version than real rock. I was shocked by the lack of artistry, compared to his Yes work."
1,And I thought 90125 sucked until I heard this,"Rabin makes a much better sideman than a leader. His guitar playing is skilled in all the gratuitous effects-laden noodley-doodley mush typical of the 80s era of big hair bands, and that guitar style is definitely not to my liking. Unfortunately, that's the HIGH point of this disc. His bass playing sucks, his lyrics suck, his vocals are bland, and the drum beats are boring. This came out in 1989, the same year as ""Doolittle"" by the Pixies, the album that would influence ""Nevermind"" by Nirvana which in turn would KILL 80s hair band mania once and for all. ""Can't Look Away"" has Rabin sounding caught off guard in the context of the times, like he's been listening to Journey's ""Escape"" every day for the past 8 years. Should be titled ""Can't Look Ahead."""
3,Same mastering as the original CD.,"This CD, touted as being REMASTERED, is digitally identical to the original CD released in 1989.Also, the artwork is blurry. Only get this release if you can't find the original CD.3 stars for false information on a great album."
3,Too much fun....,"My best friend gave this to me for my 16th birthday because of an inside joke, but we had the BEST time watching it. No one is taking themself seriously, and it' so cheesy that I could watch it over and over again. The kids are frightening, and the Elijah Wood bird looking girl who is dressed in purple lets her underwear show during the ""Soak Up the Sun Video""! It's right at 22:09 if you want to look for it. You'd think they would pay more attention to that sort of thing...Anyway, if you're a parent, this is entertaining and I would suggest it if your kids like singing and dancing videos. Just cover their eyes when beakface girl's undies pop out!"
2,Not worth the dough,This video is very short and poor quality...Extremely cheesy! My 4 year old daughter likes what there is of it though...
1,are you kidding???,"$545 for a book? are you kidding me? if you spend that kind of money on a book that's going to tell you how to make money, you're already on the way to the poorhouse! it's not going to happen. fagedaboutit!"
2,Should be in your library!,"I refer to this book time and time again. Linda Dano shows you how to dress in a timeless, flattering, classic way. When the concept is applied, you'll never say, ""I have nothing to wear!"""
4,Fantastic Simplistic Advice,"Although I found it a little frustrating that she took a one size fits all attitude to what a woman needs in her wardrobe, I still think the book is invaluable. She helps you build a core wardrobe in a timeless manner. I bought this book after having a baby and finding that my body shape had changed, I found great advice that helped me discover the most flattering styles for me, and stop wasting money on clothes that weren't quite right. She is a gem."
5,A Book To Take With You When You Shop,"I was apprehensive about buying a book done by a celebrity. Most of the time the information is useless for the average person. This book was well worth the money. She explains how to develop a great wardrobe without buying that many outfits. I hope she will do another book, because I for one will buy it."
1,"NO STARS!! But that wasn't an option, unfortunately",This is ALMOST worth the price as a novelty gift for your literate friends.The spelling and syntax are APALLING and there is no substance whatsoever to the text. Don't waste your money unless you are REALLY curious about seeing the worst job of publishing ever! Beyond disappointing.
4,GREAT,"This is actually my 3rd CD Player and it's great, is expensive, but all good things in life are... so in conclusion this CD PLAYER works great, the rechargable battery is also very powerful and even powerful if you use the back up battery case that comes with it (1 AA battery) the display provided is big, and the desgin is fabulous. The only I found bad in this CD PLAYER is that when you burn a MP3 CD and you played when you see the display you might notice that some of the song titles are not completely displayed that's becuase the name of the song is too long. And that problem never appeared when i had my old SONY ATRACC 3 CD PLAYER"
4,Great set of dishes,"Pfaltzgraff has always been synonymous with quality. The Rio pattern place setting is a great example. The plates are nice, heavy stoneware with a great design. I appreciate simple and manly design of the dishes.These plates are excellent for serving pancakes or foie gras. They can easily pass for casual or elegant. The colors of the plates make them easy to accent with napkins, glasses, placemats, centerpieces, etc.My only complaint is that after a while the dishes show light gray streaks from silverware scraping them. They do not wash off, but don't really take away from the overall visual elegance of the plates. This small flaw is what prevented me from giving the set 5 stars"
5,Excellent Products,"An RVer told me these keep mud daubers and small birds out of the vents. It is true! Mud daubers get into small holes and can build nests in the water heater, refrigerator, and heater vents (the heater vent can fit birds and bats, even chipmunks and voles), and cause fire and other damage so I bought these easily installed screens for all vents and I haven't seen one wasp go near it. Simple installation, well constructed, strong chrome plated wire, they do not move while traveling, and look nice. I highly recommend these vent screens for all vents on the RV. Check out the other screens for RV's and be sure you order the right sizes. Great prices, and fast shipping with Prime."
3,Good Idea..but,"I ordered this, It didn't quite fit my Coachmen. It's a good idea, but basically it is held in place by tension of springs and it is metal against paint when installed. I really didn't want to scrape paint off my new trailer due to vibration."

5,A true Queen of R&B!,"Listen to today's female vocalist and it's not hard to figure out who they got it from. Shirley's songs are still being replicated but NEVER duplicated today! There is Kelly Price's remake of ""As We Lay"" and Jennifer Hudson's ""You're Gonna Love Me"" to name a few. It's a shame Ms. Murdock hasn't received as much credit as everyone else! This is a very solid album that showcases her incredible vocals."
2,She Has A Great Voice! But Not longevitity,she has a great voice but were is she now. Just like most of the singer from the 80's they just dissapper
4,Neo-Prog's Best Kept Secret,"Welcome to one of the great overlooked bands of modern progressive rock. Terra Serranum is a wonderful mixture of Pink Floyd, Yes and Early Genesis tendencies. Unlike most of their peers however, the band chooses to acknowledge, rather than simply drown, in their influences.The highlights of the disc are the title track and, ""A Castle, Mother Nanny..."" The song titles might sound a little bizarre, but they don't get in the way of the oceanic soundscapes of the music itself.The only thing against the album in the standard of the mixing - it sounds a little rushed, but it doesn't ruin the album. If you do like this album, also try and track down ""Pacific Coast Highway"" and ""Natural Selection."" All three are excellent releases."
5,Outstanding series,Outstanding series with rare footage of all events covered.A true tribute to the Men and Women of both sides who gave there up most for the cause of World War 2.
1,Almost Bored me to Death,"Fortunately, this book didn't succeed in boring me to death, for if it had done so I wouldn't be writing this review. ""Almost Americans"" had only one story that sparked my interest, and that is the suicide of her first husband. I wanted to read more about how she and her children coped, because they obviously made it through somehow. The rest of the book reads more like ""went to school, had lunch, came home.""Patricia's father was from the Philippines, her mother from Norway, and both worked as domestic servants. She was born around 1930 and grew up in LA. She doesn't write much about her childhood except perfunctory things, like her father's limited command of English and his complaints about his ""spoiled"" clients. I would like to have read of some more in-depth interactions with people.I think the major problem with ""Almost Americans"" is that Patricia writes from the point of an outsider, not an insider. It's as though we're watching the events by peering over a fence."
1,chips here too,"We've owned an 8-place setting Pfaltzgraff for 2 years, and just about every piece has chipped - not very encouraging."
3,Don't buy the ones made in China,"I have a full set of these plates, some I bought were made in the US and some were made in the China. All the China made items have had issue with the dishwashers and almost all of them suffer from cracking and crazing of the porcelain and/or glaze. It's a shame, because it';s a nice dinner set - just the Chinese quality here (or lack thereof) really shows."
2,Stained cracks appeared soon after using...,"About 5 years ago, my mother bought a couple of sets of these for herself and a set for my brother. Within the first year, both of them had problems with discolored cracks appearing. Long discolored brownish cracks. You couldn't feel them but they were clearly visible so we're not sure if the pieces are still safe to use. My brother ended up having to get new dishes after a few years. For some reason, my brothers cracked sooner and worse than my mom's set. Maybe it was from a different lot or maybe it's because he microwaves a lot more often with them. If you're looking for something to hold up for years, THIS IS NOT THE SET."
1,"chips easliy, not just this set","My family, as well as friends, have purchased a total of 5 sets from Pfaltzgraff over the years. Each family was extremely disappointed with the cracking, chipping, and crazing of their set. None of these families were hard on the plates, etc. In fact, several were older with no children at home. It is very unfortunate because the patterns are fantastic. Consequently, all sets were first hand, not from discount store."
3,A Book from a Native,"A rather gentle--and genteel--guidebook from a native of the region. I usually prefer a book with more bite, but this one was OK, provided it was supplemented with a Yankee view. The copy I received was in excellent condition."
1,I should have believed the other reviewers...,"Please save your money. My trusted local pet store sells these, so I thought it would be a good quality product. Was I ever wrong. I've had this pump for less than a week. It's loud, and it has definitely lost power. Hardly any bubbles come out of the air stones in my 55 gallon tank, and the hydro sponge filters I ordered have not even arrived yet. There is no way this thing could power those filters by the time they arrive.The cheap-butt Walmart piece-of-junk pump I bought works better than this, and I've been using that thing for months, as opposed to less than a week for this Penn-Plax. Don't make the same mistake I did. The other reviewers and I are not exaggerating. This pump is not worth your money. I'm thinking even the cheapest pump on the market would be better than this."
4,"very cute little dolls, Onlly problem? Hair flair dolls are cuter","on the one hand , molded hair dolls never have a bad hair day and their pigtails will never come loose. However, I do think the Hair Flair Bratz Babyz would be more fun in the long run. I would have preferred some sort of kitty pets to the horses as well."
5,Masterpiece,Man this is the one The classic that never stops. I still hear this album playing till this day. Keith Sweat is the man.
3,Breakthrough album...,"Keith Sweat's debut album opened up the floodgates for the New Jack Swing sound with the hits ""I Want Her"" and ""Make It Last Forever"". When this album dropped back in 1987, it was one of the most creative breakthroughs of the time. ""Make It Last Forever"" (a prom theme favorite) still gets major play on radio and still hasn't lost any of it's vibrancy and zing."
5,THAT'S MORE LIKE IT,"I have listened to the ""new Keith Sweat music"". I'm not that big of a fan. I like the old Keith Sweat. I like this cd. All the old cuts are on here. People sampling and remaking Keith Sweat classics (i.e., Make it Last Forever). That was the jam. KEITH, MAKE MUSIC LIKE YOU USE TO. This was the jam!"
3,The Charmer,"Enjoyed this series as a good read. Nothing too complicated, just escapism into another world of romance with a happy ending."
4,Very different historical romance,"I was about 70% through my first Madeline Hunter book (The Seducer), when I decided to start this one and didn't stop until I finished.It had its slow moments for me after an interesting beginning but quickly developed again. I found this quite different mainly due to the fact that it was the heroine in this case who was a peeress in her own right with powers and freedom of choice that most heroines in this genre do not have. The backdrop, which the story is based on, is also an interesting history lesson.It did irritate me at times the way Sophia always appeared to be running away and her extravagance was too much, although these were explained as being an escape to her past. But eventually her character developed with Adrian's encouragements and prodding. Hunter's prose is quite beautiful and there is also plenty of humour along the way (the scene on the boat when Sophia and her two Ensemble were discovered was hilarious)."
2,A disappointment,"The story and characters are so dull. Too much politic, little romance. Adrian is no charming enough to be a charmer."
2,John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Perfecting Spray did not do anything for my curls,* John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Perfecting Spray did not do anything for my curls* I will have to try something else that might work better* I liked the Beyond Zone or the Got2B Smooth Operator to make my curls soft and managable
2,This stuff is lame,"I bought this on a whim . . . bad idea! I don't think it does much of anything to support the formation of my curls, but still makes my hair stiff. I keep putting in more, hoping that it start working, but it just gets stiffer without getting curlier. I've used up a fourth of the bottle in maybe 3 days trying to get it to work, so even if it did work well for me, the bottle wouldn't last long enough considering the price. 2 stars because the stiffness isn't that bad compared to other products I've tried, even if it doesn't work."
3,Not too bad...,"This product is great as a refresher for your curls when they start to fall..but for use to initially get them to curl, not so great...i used it with the other John Frieda products as directed but was not impressed at all. I have went back to my old mousse and just keep this handy throughout the day when they are starting to sag a little."
2,Don't Bother,"My hair is slightly less frizzy, but not by much. It improved my curls for about an hour or two. I am of mixed race (to help you understand my type of hair)."
3,Waiting to retract,"Does this charger retract? I don't know. Maybe any day now. I pulled it out once, and that was it. Stayed out. If somebody bet me $1,000,000, I think I could get it to retract. If one of those healers on TV laid hands on it, maybe it would retract. But all I wanted was something to recharge by LifeDrive from Palm. Remember those? And this thing DOES RECHARGE my LifeDrive. So I'm not complaining. I'm the kind of person who just tries to get along."
3,Very cool,The idea is very cool and the product is functional. The retract ability isn't as smooth as I would like it though. Overall a satisfactory purchase.
5,Travelling,"I hae a lot of trips wirh my car, so what can I say. This item help me to stay connected always."
5,Welcome Back,"This is the original line-up of LT, only fewer. Porter Howell comes up from the back and does a great job on lead vocals. There are plenty of good potential singles on here in the fashion of other LT singles. 'Missing Years' is on the radio in some places, and I think we'll hear more. The price is right and if you are a fan or curious, this as a good of an album as anything these guys have done. Try 'Texas 101' and 'Party Life' - two other favorites from this album. Using [..] I bought this along with their recent live album (Live and Loud). Good deal."
5,Absolutely Beautiful!!,I was pleasantly surprised when I received my Summer Breeze place settings and accessories. They are absolutely beautiful! I can't believe the quality. The colors are gorgeous. I love the size of the mugs and the bowls. I would highly recommend this product. The pictures don't do them justice!
1,Don't buy it,"I have had these dishes several years. They chip easily and are covered with silverware marks that do not come off, even with the recommended cleaner. I love the colors and the scalloped edges, but am very disappointed in the quality of this product."
3,Beautiful product - terrible packaging,"I agree with all of the comments here. The glass is beautiful and exactly what I wanted, but arrived cracked. The return process could not have been easier, but the replacement also arrived cracked. What does it take to convince them to package these items more carefully? I would gladly pay for the shipping if I could depend on the packaging."
1,"Arrived broken, very disappointed","I read the reviews before buying and hoped I would be lucky enough to have my item arrive safely. No such luck. Purchased yesterday as a gift and had it sent overnight to the recepient. It arrived broken in 5 places, not cracked...broken. Replacement is on the way, but what a bad impression to make on someone when given as gift. Box was NOT marked fragile, handle with care, etc. Packaging consisted only of 2/3 of this covered with one thin sheet of bubble wrap. Terribly disappointing. Hope the replacement isn't broken as well, it would be beautiful if it were in tact. You take a great risk if you decide to buy this. I learned my lesson."
2,Look elsewhere for Finance intro...,"I'm an adjunct professor at a regional liberal arts university, and I admit I've not read as many textbooks as the average ivory tower dweller. That being said, I used this book (through no choice of my own) to teach an Undergraduate Intro to Finance class. Decent text, and some good explanation of the more complex ideas in the second half of the book, but what kills this as a textbook is the HORRIBLE support materials. Errors throughout the Power Point presentations, test bank questions, study problems...I was so disgusted by the end of the semester. It's probably okay as a brush-up text, but not what I'd recommend for newbies."
3,It's not new,"Although this book helps me a lot, but it's not a new book. I found it out after one year."
2,Not as good as the previous two in this series,"Many of the characters form the previous two books reappear and they are fun, but the story is pretty silly. Overall, this was a disappointment."
5,Severely underrated classic thrash,"This album was hard to find for me, so I'm very pleased to have purchased it recently. So far it's the only Flotsam & Jetsam album I own, but that will change because these guys tear it up. This one seems to be a fan favorite, but I can't say which one's best because I haven't heard them all. This stuff is just as good as Anthrax, Testament, and Megadeth of the same period, so that's why I'm confused as to why it's not more widely known and appreciated. Any fan of old school thrash will love this."
3,Again just ok.,"This album proves that Jetsam didn't need Newsted to make a ""just ok"" album. It started out strong but just faded into ""decent"" nothing special territory. Again decent but nothing special."
2,Mediocre effort from an otherwise excellent group,"I've had this album since '89 and consider myself a Flotsam&Jetsam fan, but I have yet to find more than two songs that are worthwhile. Elton John's ""Saturday Night's..."" and ""I Live You Die"" are the only reason this album gets more than one star. The other songs seem to go nowhere and the guitar work doesn't grap your attention like their other fine albums. If you've never listened to F & J before, pick up ""When the Storm comes Down"", ""Cuatro"", or ""Doomsday ..."" (originally released in '86?, wow I'm getting OLD!!)"
2,idling the engine,"This DeLorean CD has much going for it -- stunning, vivid production, spare and at times haunting folk rock arrangements that border on slo-core, an air of woebegone cool, but the one thing it's missing, and I really hate to say this, is great songs. It really takes a plunge at ""beachcomber blues,"" which just never seems to go anywhere. I like the vibe here and the way the band thinks. I can ""feel"" the tug of war between emotional pain and detachment. It's a road well traveled by the likes of Red House Painters/Sun Kil Moon and Grant Lee Buffalo, but the invention is not there. Musical ideas are begun but seem not to have been developed. The song has taken a back seat to the sound. Everything is very simple; the chords never take you to someplace new. This disc is going to sound very good to some people, and that's good, but I think I've been around listening to too much for too long because I just felt my mind wandering. I wanted it to be more."
1,Swanwick's Methods Are Laughable,"""Draw what you see not what you think you see"" is the phrase Ronald Swanwick uses when teaching. Unfortunately this flat and relatively dull book goes against that completely. Throughout the book he teaches people how to draw to his particular style - rather than introducing them to the concept of art.The pages are filled with extremely bland pictures which quite frankly could have been drawn by a 2 year old for all the difference it makes.He doesn't use a wide range of colours in the few colour pictures he does. In fact if any of his pictures ever are in colour, beginner artists will be shocked to ""learn"" that clouds do not have colour in them. They are either white or in very rare cases grey. Overall this is a very poorly written and presented book which has been written by a very bad artist and quite frankly you would be better off spending your money on a book which lets you decide how you want to draw pictures yourself."
4,Good deal,These dishes are nice and simple. They are pretty yet not overly feminine. They work with everything whether you are going for elegant or simple. My only problem has been that I have grey knife markings on the plates. Not terriby attractive and I'm not sure why hey are there or how to get rid of them
4,Hand-made Look,"I just received my plates and love the care-free ""handmade pottery"" look...The colors are great- muted, yet a lively design. I am going to pair them with another pattern , Villa Flora, and will mix both patterns at one setting for an eclectic look...I think they are a great everyday plate .As far as utensil marks go, I understand they can be removed w/ a soft abrasive cleanser?"
5,This Corrosion is the best....,"This is a great piece of musical art. This album has a unique sound, and is a great buy for the price. Any fan of music should have this album, even if it's just for ""This Corrosion"", one of the best songs ever written. Click the purchare button now."
5,Still The Best,"I listen to Floodland a few days ago for the first time in a long while and it still moves me like no other record. The architechture is huge, and the production is seamless. The lyrics compltely stand on thier own and continue to change meaning for me after 11 years! This record is like one long journey through the dreamtime and back again. It seems to me a BIG mistake to pigeonhole the Sisters a ""Goth"" band, they are much so more than that. However, does Eldritch have the courage to COMPLETLY reinvent himself again? I wonder......."
2,The third incarnation of the SOM,"This record and all alleged ""Sisters of Mercy"" work done after this always left me a bit uneasy. Everyone who was around and listening to the Sisters of Mercy in the early 80s knows that the band - the real Sisters of Mercy - broke up in 1985. And then Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams came out with The Mission (UK) and we all wondered ""what will Andrew Eldritch do now that the Sisters of Mercy are gone?"" Well, we all got the answer to that question when Eldritch gathered around him a few completely new musicians, and tried to peddle his new venture on the reputation and fame of the Sisters of Mercy brand. It all seems a bit smarmy.Having said that, the sound of the record isn't bad. Its just overproduced, a bit cliche, and not that innovative or exciting. The original SOM (and for that you need to track down the compilation ""Some Girls Wander by Mistake"") were innovative and exciting. This is just - well, just bland 1987 trying too hard to be 1982 again."
1,The Pale Prince's Puerile Pandering,"Little Andy E., the pale ponce, spews forth another scary assortment of noises that go pompous in the night. Only This Corrosion comes close to any real emotion or even the kind of ""big dark rawk"" grandeur that Bro Sister was evidently aiming for. Even as an old friend of the elegant Ms. Morrison, I have to give this one a black-fingernail-polished thumbs-down."
4,edible and useful plants of california,"This book is quite thorough. There are pictures, but not as many as there could be to make the book excellent. Books that try to describe the differences between two plants that look alike, but one is poisonous and the other is a useful herb, should provide large numbers of color pictures."
5,Book on California's edible plants from Amazon,"This book is very well written, fun to read, and informative. I purchased it for baclground information on an historical novel, but found myself reading it just for fun."
2,Wasn't very good.,Wasn't very good. It is hard for a book like this to be helpful without color pictures.
