4,A case Excellently Presented,"Bugliosi is one of a kind! He makes his points clearly and effectively. I wish he could take all these so called ""justices"" to court where he would run circles around them with his startlingly clear reasoning and thinking, ending with them all being dragged off to the nearest prison for treason. A great book to get the juices of freedom flowing again from a great man who truly cares about justice."
1,FACT: Bush won every count.,"I love the old excuse: The butterfly ballot was too confusing! Blame your own voters' stupidity if you like, but it doesn't change the fact: Bush won every count. The only reason the Supreme Court got involved at all was because of the renegade FL Supreme Court, which illegally created NEW law in order to delay the recounts... which wouldn't have mattered in the end, anyway. Much ado about nothing, except the ignorance of this book's fans."
3,"Of course, it's all a moot point anyway","Months after the fact it has been determined by multiple media outlets that Bush carried Florida anyway. Even so, I know that wouldn't make a crime by the Supreme Court right. Trouble is, Vince, there was no crime. The fact that Molly Ivins did the prologue should tell the reader where the author is coming from."
1,BIAS!!!,"It is very clear that Mr. Vincent Bugliosi, is only concern with his political bias point of view.It also very clear, that he does not understand the Constitution of The United States, or the Supreme Court. After reading this light weight essay, I re-read the Constitution. I strongly suggest Mr.Bugliosi, to do the same.The arguments he presents to discredit one candidate, can equally be applied to his candidate. In the end, it's a mute point!The Betrayal of America, is actually found in booklets like this, completly politicaly motivated. What a shame!I only wish, I hadn't wasted my money on it."
3,The Betrayal of America: How the supreme court undermined the constitution and chose our president,"I didn't think it was the best book I ever read, but it was interesting. Mr. Bugliosi does not do his best work when he is so angry. The premise of the book is scary, but not hard to believe given the highly partisan society we now live in. Bush haters will love the book!"
4,Good Book,"Frankly, I think that all these 1 star reviewers didn't read it. You don't have to have read it to write a review. The fact that their reviews usually consist of one or two sentences decrying ""liberal bias"" or focusing on the widely reported ""fact"" that ""Bush wins no matter how you count the vote"" shows that they didn't read it, or if they did, they have completely missed the point. The book focuses on the Supreme Court decision. Period. The decision was wrong. And it's wrong even if Bush won by a MILLION votes."
3,"A decent book, but misses the point","Bugliosi misses the point with this book. Whether the SCOTUS threw the election to Bush is really not the issue. It was what happened behind the scenes in Florida that should be looked at. Republican Kathleen Harris had thousands of eligible voters removed from the voting rolls because they ""may"" have had a felony conviction. That is just the tip of the iceberg as to how this woman, and Jeb Bush disqualified thousands of voters, mostly blacks , mostly Democrats, from voting. The count should not have been necessary, and the SCOTUS ruling should not have ever happened.I personally believe the SCOTUS acted illegally, but if you want to know why it is a moot point, or should be, read the first chapter of the Michael Moore book ""Stupid White Men"". It will make your blood boil, your stomach churn, and it makes Bugliosi's thoughtful, but a bit incoherent book unnecessary."
5,So Plainly Written It Is Chilling!,"This is the history that will be written about the Supreme Court and their off the cuff ruling; a ruling that the 5 justices were too ashamed to sign. I also enjoyed his consideration of Boies shortcomings in front of the Supreme Court which I failed to consider and have never heard from any other source. He also spells out the hypocritical treatment of the Florida Supreme Court by the federal Supreme Court and demonstrates his logic with analogies and ""What if.."" scenarios and applicable prior court cases (not the ones molded for the one time use of the court) that will leave the reader convinced that something horrible happened to our justice system during this election."
5,Shrapnel,"Democracy has taken a direct hit. After reading this book, and researching some of the facts given, i realize that our democracy has been severely wounded, if not killed. Vince points out treasonous and heinous acts perpetrated by what is supposed to be our most sacred, highest court. i am stunned and outraged.Every claim that Vince makes in this book is acurate and true. i wish i could call this book a lie, because i'm sick from the knowledge of what has taken place.our supreme court is not so supreme. this book proves our supreme court is soaked in guilt, and filthy from crime. these five need to be removed immediately from our hallowed halls.this book is very reader friendly. the reader does not need a degree in civics to understand this subjecti recommend this book highly, and i must say that anyone who disagrees is a person who can't handle the truth"
4,Never Knew Before,"Bugliose, Vincent is a very repatable author. This book is backed up by facts supplies. I agree with him. Something has to be done"
5,THE TRUTH IS OUT!,"Vicent Bugliosi in his book,"" Betrayal of America"" has exposed the five Supreme Court Justices, who gave the election to George Bush, for what they are; criminals!I have been voting in Presidential elections since Truman and Dewey and have never felt so disenfranchised! Thank you,Vincent for the guts to write this excellent book. It is a must read for any voter in this country."
2,Even the thinest pancake has two sides!,"The author claims to have risen above self-interest in viewing the United State's Supreme Court's decision in the last presidential election. However, his highly emotional denigration of the justices while reiterating only the views of the Gore defense team fails to distinguish him from any other individual who feels helplessly wronged. Meritorious arguments in favor of Vice Prsiden Gore were, in my opinion, better presented by his legal team than by the author."
1,Weary in Seattle,"Skip it unless you're in need of another liberal afirmation. It's the same old plot. It isn't fair that Gore lost because, well, he's Al Gore... That pesky Supreme Court!"
1,Poorly Researched,"If the basic premise of a book is a lie, how can one believe the rest of it? FACT: The U.S. Supreme Court voted 7-2 that the recounts being done in Florida were unconstitutional. Justice Breyer (a liberal, appointed by President Clinton and a friend of Al Gore voted as one of the seven.) What was voted on 5-4 was the time frame for the recounts in the 4 largely democratic counties. It really irks me when an author prefers sensationalism over the facts."
5,Denial is not just a river in Egypt!,"I was taught to respect the US Supreme Court and the Justices themselves. After the outrageous verdict in Bush Versus Gore I struggled to maintain this attitude, making all kinds of excuses, offering explanations, trying to ""understand.""Thanks to Mr. Bugliosi's concise book, I now know (as the saying goes) ""Denial is not just a river in Egypt."" What was done by Scalia and his four cohorts was criminal, an ""in your face"" robbery.Betrayal of America makes it clear the case was Bush versus the United States of America. The book has Mr. Bugliosi's original article, amplifications and legal summaries. They demonstrate how Americans were victimized by this vindictive judgment by Republican operatives on the Supreme Court, aimed at punishing Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Democrats and liberals. We are all still paying for this reprehensible decision by an agency of government it is no longer possible to respect or honor."
1,"Good politics, bad bad writing","I don't need convincing that Gore won the election and that the Supremes acted out of politics more than jurisprudence. I was hoping to read a savage dismantling of the Court's decision. But, I found Bugliosi's book to be so badly written that it was close to unreadable. It's his article from The Nation padded with inflated forewords and extraneous end-notes. Bugliosi calls people he disagrees with names (e.g., ""mutants"") and writes with all the grace of someone phoning in to a rightwing call-in show. His arguments are mainly explosions of anger and frustration, berating anyone who might disagree with him rather than spelling out his ideas. Also, the triple mixed metaphors in a single sentence do a Tanya Harding on the language, if you know what I mean.I should have been a perfect reader for this book: I agree with his politics, I'm damn pissed at the Court, and I love passionate, partisan writing. But this book is just baaaaaad."
1,Well-written but simply wrong...,"This is a well written and thought out crtique of the 2000 election mess, however it just happens to be wrong. After the election, several news organizations conducted their own impartial recounts and every one determined that Bush would have won the election had the Supreme Court allowed the selective recounts to continue. The authors obviously know about these recent recounts and chose to ignore them. The truth would ruin the story line."
1,Did Al Gore Ghost Write This Book?,"A confused and muddled attempt to revise history. The author doesn't present arguments and supporting facts, he presents rants. Footnotes and citations are at best confused, and at worst non-existent. This book should be about one third the length it is - it is full of inappropriate filler."
1,The votes have been counted.,"Neither the author of this book, nor his fans here, seems to be aware of this, but after a media recount of all the ""undervotes"" in Florida, the result stands; Bush won. In light of this it's hard to understand what all the histrionics are about. The Supreme Court did NOT chose the President, the voters did. Mr. Bugliosi likes to engage in hypothetical speculation, as in "" Would they have ruled the same if Gore had been ahead?"" Of course in that case the Florida Supremes would not have intervened, and it would never have made it's way to the US Supreme Court. If you're a fan of 'The Nation' this will be heady stuff. If you want a more objective account of the Florida mess, pass."
1,Not Even Close,"Mr. Bugliosi's expertise as a criminal prosecutor does not translate into expertise into Constitutional law. Agree or disagree with the Court's decision in Bush v. Gore, this is lightweight, polemical analysis dressed up as legal opinion. Waste of time."
1,Phil Ronzone,"This book is typical of the ""CIA Plot Killed JFK"" or ""Elvis Is Alive and in the Mothership"" mentality. Even now, long after the election, the multiple studies and recounts by newspapers of all political leanings show that indeed, in any case, even with recounts, Bush would have still won. While I'm Libertarian myself and wish a pox on both of the paries, I keep this book as an example of the growing emotional hysteria of the Democratic party, which now greatly exceeds the Republican party. In short, a good book to find disgust in - disgust at Democratic hysterical tactics. I ESPECIALLY liked how the US Supreme Court telling FL to follow its own laws provoked so much Democratic anger."
4,A Conservative Excoriates 'Bush v. Gore',"Here is a book by a self-described conservative that trashes the partisan reasoning behind ""Bush v. Gore."" I'm still waiting for a book by a self-described liberal that defends the decision.The book's bombastic tone keeps it from getting five stars."
2,No great prose here,I thought I'd understand more about the legal system after I bought this book.Bugliosi writes the book as if by flight-of-mind. The entire book seems to be one entire run-on sentence.I was looking for a congent argument on why the Supreme Court decided to stay the Florida recount. I think I'm going to read Dershowitz's book on the same subject.
1,Say What?,The fact Bugliosi left out the vital Reynolds V Sims is a blatant and obvious attempt to distort the ruling.Bugliosi was way over his head and out of his league when it came to the legal aspects of this book and his conclusions were based on politics and not the law.What do I know..I'm just a constitutional attorney and Bugliosi is a mere county prosecutor!Judge Richard Posner has a better book that probes the Bush V Gore case that is based on law and not politics. This is a much better book and it put's Bugliosi's legal interpretations to shame..or is that Sham?
5,Bugliosi hits another home run,"Bugliosi convincingly exposes the unbelievable treachery of Rehnquist, Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy, and O'Connor (and some embarrassing oversights by Gore's legal team). We need more writers like Bugliosi to counter a mainstream press that would be more aptly named the GOP's ""Ministry of Propaganda""."
5,A Must Have!,"This is like ""My Utmost for His Highest"" for children as young as three...up to around ten or so. I am so excited I finally found a devotional the kids look forward to...fun, creative, and powerful!"
4,Pretty awesome,"I received this product very quickly. But I expected it to be up to episode 100. And when I saw that it was only to episode 77 or something like that, I was disappointed. It must've been my incorrect assumption. I just couldn't find find myself giving 5 stars. And the Prussia bandana is cute as well!"
5,I Want to Lick It,"Love all of the dubbed episodes from the past two seasons, and I've saw the previews for this, so I know it's going to be great. ^w^"
4,PASTA~~~,"1. I'm a Hetalia fan so I know exactly what I purchased.2. Excellent shipping service. Came the day before it should deliver.3. I love the extras.4. The only flaw: it has troubles playing. I had to manually go over the Windows Media Player to play the DVD. If you're going to select ""Play"" in the DVD drive it's in, it will not recognize the program it should play in. It's like confused, like most characters in this series. Also, if you usually play DVDs via VLC player or Real, it will not play. Not even DivX would. Use Windows MP.That is all c:"
1,why?,"I'm sure i would love this product if i could ever get it.I pre ordered this along with hetalia paint it white, i received paint it white nov 30th.this one has not shipped yet and estimated delivery is jan 20th-24th.if there was a problem i would have liked to have been told about it.otherwise why would i pre order? just not right."
4,I love you but...,"IDK Dont bash me but season three wasnt really HYPED UP like the first two. I love hetalia but i cant really say i was glad i bought this season. It did have its funny moments especially with Prussia, lol and thats whats making me keep this cause of him xD"
5,Worth every cent; pure fun. C:,"It's been said again and again with the Hetalia series, but hey: The re-watch value is über-high! Non-stop laughs, yet some intriguing facts and some historical events are rubbed in, too. I recommend this to any sort of anime fan, since most genres - besides gore/horror/mystery/violence/action - are covered, but it's mainly humor. Better yet, most of the characters aren't obnoxious, unlike most characters these days, and will have you waving and saluting their flag and wanting to learn the country's national anthem.Well.Maybe.I HAVE NO REGRETS.Oh, and for those that are already fans of Hetalia, they'll be thrilled to see that Prussia is featured more."
5,Finally!,"Pre-ordered it right when it became available. Hetalia fans have been waiting a long time for the third season to be released. While I'm not a big fan of the English voice dubbing that Funimation did for this particular series, it's still very lovely to get on DVD. Shipping was remarkably fast, seeing as I got it a day before the release date, which was supposed to be the 17th of January, but I certainly am not complaining. xD Definitely an essential for any fan of the Hetalia series, especially since the limited edition comes with a special casing and a Hetalia bandana. This season featured the very popular character, Prussia, on a purple bandana. These bandanas, themselves, are wonderful collectables. They come in the limited editions of all seasons, as well as the movie, ""Paint It White."" Makes a terrific gift or collection piece."
3,I should have read the reviews first!,"I have worked out to other Denise Austin videos. Needless to say, I was disappointed with the missed and inconsitent number of steps throughout the aerbic portion of this video. Even a couple of her aerobic participants in the video missed steps or moves. I would have preferred the camera follow her face as she turned with the steps. I did like the enthusiasm and support she gives throughout the video. The toning and firming section needed more reps and verbal announcements when changing from one position to the next. Keeping good form means I cannot keep my eyes glued to the TV, so my instructor needs to tell me when to change. I can leave or take the yoga. Overall, I will be looking for a new video workout and then shelve this one."
3,An OK workout,I was looking forward to Denise's upbeat spirit but found it to be VERY annoying! I was disappointed in the actual areobics workout b/c she does not use much of a variety of steps. Everything is repeated too much. The toning section was average compared to other videos I have used. It is also obvious that they didn't practice the routine much because you can see a lot of times where even Denise Austin gets messed up. She also does not use any cues as to what you will be doing next.
2,Good workout... hard to follow,"I have done a couple of her videos and this one is ok. (I have the original one with the oldies as the soundtrack.) It is a good workout and if you just had a baby you will be out of breath during it, so you know you are getting something out of it.. The only problems I had with it are ONE: alot of the things she does are grapevine and such and im not from that era and was having to learn the steps.. I was ok with most of them but there is one part of the video that I resort to jumping jacks because no matter what I do I cant figure out how to do what she is doing.. TWO: as one of the previous reviewers stated... she doesnt use enough verbal commands when changing positions especially when they are doing the strengthening. SO you have to constatly look up to see if she is still there or not.. So in closing its a good workout but not one of her best."
4,this is a video not a dvd,i am very dissapointed. i thought it is a dvd and later realized that it's a video... if you know anyone that would like to buy it from me i would gladly sell it to u. just contact me gold718r@gmail.com
1,music to this workout is not the same as original and is terrible,"original music to this work out has been cut and different music added, i know, i have this work out on DVD from years ago, but i used it so much that it started skipping.so i thought i would order one on line, and the original music has been cut and replaced with flute type very unmotivating music that doesn't even go with the work out, and the music is too load you can hardly hear the instructor.was very dissapointed and trying to return it for my money back.thumbs downnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"
3,For the quick thinking dancer type,"It's important to have proper postures and use isometrics with each exercise. The aerobic routines switch between five steps. I could not get into doing one before the next began. Then she adds double-times and other variations just as I got the hang of it. For the non-dancer, three steps, or each step for a longer time period would be more doable. I'd also like more stretching before the aerobics. This video has it all afterwards."
2,Didn't like this video!,"I own several of Denise Austin's workout videos and I rate this as one of the worst. I consider myself a coordinated person, but I had difficulty following her moves. What really made me mad was the fact that her counts were off several times....5 reps to one side, then 7 reps to the other. I am giving my copy to charity in hopes that somebody other than me will get some use out of the video. The only saving grace to this video were the leg/butt and ab moves at the near the end."
2,not the safest and not even 20 minutes of aerobics!,"The worst thing about this video is that the claim of 20 minutes of aerobics is false. There are only 3 5-minute aerobics segments. And, as some of the other reviewers mentioned, this video is not the best for safety. There are a lot of poor cues. Denise does a lot of twisting-type moves that I didn't think were necessary (so I left them out) and my knees are still killing from the parts I did do. Most of the aerobics moves seem more dance-oriented than necessary to get your body working. There is a TON of bouncing and jump-twisting and even when she does establish a ""routine"", she doesn't always stay with the counts. You know it's bad when even the people working out with her are getting screwed up. Even so, this video does get my heart going, but only after I make a ton of modifications, and now my knees are hurt, so I won't be doing it any longer."
4,Great book make travel easier,I never travel far without this book. It shows what you'll find at each exit on the interstate highway system. It shows all 2 digit roads and many of the 3 digit roads around major cities. Two minor complaints - I found some exits where we had to drive a few miles off the highway into town to find what was listed. It usually tells if they are not right on the exit. And the book combines exits that have 'A' & 'B' into one. It isn't always easy to know which one to take. Even with these small drawbacks the book is worth it. It is especially great if you travel with kids.
1,I second the motion - bring back Exit Authority,"Thank goodness we never threw out our old copy of Exit Authority. ""The Next Exit"" is nowhere near as easy to scan for the exit service you're looking for, and the state-based organization was a poor choice."
3,Save your money,For a westerner there doesn't seem to be much information. I looked up nearby areas and wasn't impressed. I'd suggest actually looking at a copy before you buy it.
5,Why didn't Michael write this book a year ago?,"This book is great! I could not figure how to add international support to any of my VB applications, and the help files were useless. Then Michael comes in and tells me all about font character sets, Unicode, formats, database collations, locales, translation and everything else that I did not understand at all.The book literally saved my job because my boss was getting pretty upset at all those question marks that were showing up instead of characters in the application I wrote. But just before my review, I was able to waltz into his office, show him the book, and prove to him that a lot of people have this problem, and show him I had the solution. I like best that Michael (or does he prefer ""michka""?) actually gave me a lot of answers to all the questions that my boss asked me.The one thing I want to know is why didn't he write this book a year ago? It seems like he could have sold a lot more copies!"
2,Not good enough!,This book does give good overview of some basic conceps but is very unclear. I tried to run samples on windows 2000 server machine with all language packs installed but the samples just don't work at all! The book contains more of an overview kind of material rather than how to do an actual application in VB!
1,Don't waste your money !,"The book is very poorly writen. There is NO consistent organization, NO clear explanations. The author assumes that the reader already knows everything. The code in the book doesn't work. It's just a mixtrure of tables and non-functional code samples without clearly deliniated fundamental structure and explanation of the concepts. It just makes the job of figuring it out so much more difficult. What a disappointment!"
5,Eye opening,I thought this book was wonderful because it brings up many topics that get your brain thinking in totally different ways. I am currently doing a research paper on the possiblities of Mother Goddess worship in ancient times and this book has been very helpful. What makes this book different from a lot that I have read on the subject is that she shows many different sides to the topics she brings up. This is great because most of the subject is subjective anyway. The book is also very easy to read and follow. It's a great read!
2,Not a whole lot to it,"I ran this adventure as a DM. Its usable, but pretty poorly written. It contains some good storylines, but they aren't developed well. It leaves a lot of work for the DM if you want this module to be worthwhile."
5,BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! MIND BLOWING!,"This game rocks! I have got to say this is the best racing game I've ever played. The graphics are great. The music is great. I love it. The sheer adrenaline rush of this game is mindblowing!The originality is non existant. Futursitic magnetic hover bikes have been done many many times (The whole jet moto series, along with others) but this takes the cake. With easy to learn controls you can jump right into this one. But dont be scared off by the word easy. There is always room for expansion of your skill. NO SPEED LIMIT! A definite buy at a great price. (no i dont work for amazon).Aaron"
5,HEADRUSH,"LOVED THE DEMO,SEARCHED FOR THE GAME WHICH RUNS BETTER THAN DEMO WITH NO LOCKUPS AND ONLY INFREQUENTLY SPORADIC CRASH TO DESKTOP WITH MAX SPEED ON RACETRACK.......TOLERABLE UNTIL I CAN FIND A FIX......"
4,Pretty Play Tent,This tent is just as pretty as it looks in the pics. Construction is good and it provides plenty of imaginary camping fun.
3,About half-decent,"MOON ON THE WATER is like a meal with a delicious first course, while the rest is bland and tasteless. The collection starts off with some very good stories: a dying robber thinks of his father during his last moments; a delusional man spends half his waking hours in a fantasy world; a child's jealousy of his newborn brother grows; a man entertains a little girl who may or may not be his own. Most of them are short, and they have a satisfying bite to them.After these, the book takes a different track. There are a few gems buried in the remainder, but too much of it consists of confused, disconnected ramblings. Many of them, even the straightforward ones, simply left me shaking my head. In addition, a number of stories couldn't be classified as horror even under the broadest definition, though I wouldn't have minded if they'd been better. Overall, a disappointment."
3,over-rated?,"Considering the number of good reviews his short stories have gotten, I expected a lot more from this book. For the most part, the stories do not live up to the hype-- the writing was undistinguished, and many of the plots were too obvious or just left me scratching my head in bewilderment. Some of them rambled on aimlessly or dwelt too heavily on basic racial conflicts. Of the 22 stories in this collection, the only ones I really enjoyed were ""Pop is Real Smart"", ""The Call"", and ""Other Advantages""."
3,Tasty but peanut covering is messy in the heat.,"The beauty of store bought prepackaged granola bars is that they are convenient and are usually non-sticky/messy compared to homemade ones.Nature Valley has always made some excellent bars that did not melt into a soggy mess when stashed in the car or brought on extended roadtrips/hikes/camping in the warmer months. However, this new line of bars from Nature Valley features a sweet peanut coating similar to the yoghurt coating pretzles are dipped in. This coating is quite sweet and melts in the heat.I would not reccomend particular Nature Valley line for outdoor activities in the warmer months, but would not hesistate to for the winter months.It is also a great treat to get kids off candy bars and into healthier granola bars as the sweet coating is quite peanuty and sweet enough. The bar itself does contain crisped rice that their original crunchy line does not, but it is still a vast improvement healthwise over other more common snack bars available."
5,These Sweet and Salty Nut Bars taste so good!,"These Sweet and Salty Nut bars are handy for breakfast, snacks and quick meals. The combination of flavors is delicious. They are filling and easy to ""take with"" you to eat on the go or just to eat at any time of day. The peanut are my favorite."
1,Not fresh,"I am addicted to these. But the ones I bought through Amazon, though they look identical, simply do not taste as good as the ones I've bought from Costco. They don't seem as fresh. I bought these in August and they expire in December, but they already tasted stale in August. By contrast, before even eating half of these, I bought more from Costco in October and they have an expiration date in April; they are much fresher, and I'm going to have trouble finishing the ones from Amazon because the ones from Costco are so much better."
3,"Love the bars, but this isn't that good of a deal","I love these, but at little over $.83 a bar, it is not a good deal. You can get a box of 30 at Sam's club for less than than 9 dollars. At the price I paid, which was $8.47 it comes in at about $.28 per bar. Just letting you know that there are better deals out there. Not to mention it comes in one box, and you don't have to deal with 12 six pack sized boxes."
3,The Incredible Shrinking Nut Bar,"This bar gets smaller and smaller and smaller; it's almost a joke.It would be interesting to see the OZ per bar when they first marketed compared to now. They do a great job of hiding the product size and making it seem insignificant.Strategy: Make a great tasting bar. Get people loyal with special pricing on the boxes of bars in the grocery stores. Then, shrink the size, one step at a time, while keeping price the same. Most won't notice. We certainly did.Very disappointed, will not buy this bar or any other Nature Valley products in the future due to this deception."
2,"Tasty Bar But Small, Nearly Expired & Contain Unhealthy Ingredients","Pros:(1) Tasty! That's the main reason I bought it. Love the melted peanut taste. Addictive! Yum.(2) Well, because it's small, it's easy to carry around. Lovely dessert.Cons:(1) The bar gets smaller and smaller, while the price stays the same - as other reviewers have pointed out. It's almost half the original size now.(2) I consider it an unethical business practice to mail out products with an expiration date in 2 months, and fail to disclaim this piece of critical information in the description. The vendor should not sell nearly-expired products like this!(3) Please note that there are many ARTIFICIAL COLORINGS used in this product, and there is PALM OIL used. Those who are health conscious might want to take note of this. (I bought it because I didn't read the ingredient list carefully, but you should.)"
1,The Incredible Shrinking Bar!!!,"These have been my go to snack for around the past 5 years. They taste great, but over time have been reduced significantly in size. In the last case I purchased at Costco, I'm guessing the bars have been reduced another 10% in size. I'll have to find something else before these bars are shrunk to ""fun-size!""If Nature Valley would have just kicked the price up 10% I probably wouldn't have cared. But, the constant reduction in size is frustrating... almost like they think the consumer is too stupid to notice!"
2,Smaller and smaller,"I like my coffee first thing in the morning and often accompany it with a granola bar. I usually buy Nature Valley, basically out of habit. This morning when I opened the wrapper and saw what was inside I had to look twice. The bars have shrunk. Same price. Less content. This makes me mad. There is probably only about two bites to each bar and I am not joking. I will now have to seriously reconsider what kind of granola bars I will be getting from now on. But I object to getting ripped off and that's what they are doing at Nature Valley."
4,Classic Eighties,I am not a big fan of eighties music but many of my friends are so I purchased this CDso I could play it when they were in my car. They all seem to like it.
3,"Not bad, not amazing either.","This movie was okay, the story line seemed to be split between too many people. It felt like the role of the protagonist shifted too much. I think if more focus was put on refining the storyline it would have been a lot better. But even still, it was not awful. It's a permanent addition to my collection of Spanish movies from Spain."
3,a bit confusing but overall a good movie,"I rent this movie and end up buying it because of Fernando Fernan Gomez he is an excellent actor and he plays the grandfather of David in this film. Basically, this movie centers around the characters emotions and it is a bit confusing had to see it twice, it can be depressing but it centers around an important message about family and tragedy. If your a fan of Fernando Fernan Gomez, try ""La Lengua de las Mariposas"", he is an excellent actor. I think I enjoy this film because of his performance."
3,Good,"Heard this at a bar in ST John, US Virgin Islands. Sounded a lot better down there than in my car!!"
1,The worst publisher ever!,"My experience with ordering the Lowrider subscription has been an absolute disaster!! They don't keep accurate records. There is always a problem. The same one EVERY MONTH that prevents them from sending out the issues monthly as advertized. Then to make bad worse, it takes them another 12 weeks minimum to send the issue out! They missed my February issue and I don't get ,my next one tell JUNE!!!!! I would STRONGLY recommend that you not waist your time or money on this. It's a rip-off!!"
1,Very Impressive Graphics on the Box,"I'm an Avid PC Gamer and an Resident Expert on the F/A-18's Superior Rival - The F14 Tomcat. Despite this, I figured that I would give the F/A-18 Precisoin Strike Fighter Game a try. Well, my expectations were not met. The graphics and performance of the game itself was....marginal at best. I cannot and would not recommend this particular game to anyone who has not already made the big mistake of purchasing it in the first place. It is tedious in the mechanics of switching back and forth between the keyboard and joystick controls and (I don't care what anyone may say about how wonderful mulling through an exhaustive array of written verbage associated with the instruction manual is) the game is hardly worth the investment of time and energy. Sorry, but the payoff is just not there. Consider thyself warned. If you should decide to purchase this game anyway, you do so at your own peril and a lighter wallet or purse."
2,Way too hard to play,"I guess if your in the market for a true combat sim, this is for you. It's a 100 something page instruction booklet. I've been playing computer and video games all my life and I never got so frustrated after spending (...) bucks. If your not a SERIOUS flight sim gamer, you will end up like me. I wanted some cool missions, some cool weapons, and some flying fun. It will take the average person 3-5 hours to even START to be able to play this game with any level of success. I guess I should have stuck to playstations Top Gun or Air Combat."

2,Target Locked!! And so is your computer.,"It has all the appeal of a flying game, but it locks your computer up and forces you to reboot! Try flying a mission, completing that mission, and successfully landing at home base only to lose everything to a unpredictable system lockup.(...)P>The instruction manual doesn't have a keyboard shortcut section either, but if you dig around then it can be found on their website."
2,Seeing the mote in another's eye,"I try to approach environmental books with an open mind, and I try to read seriously from both sides of the debate. The Ehrlich's book turned out to be a grave disappointment because they have a tendency to do exactly what they critize others of doing. In particular they spend too much time attacking the extreme statements of the ""brownlash"" books of a more popular nature instead of trying to discuss and refute the more serious criticisms of the various problems the world may be facing. I also tend to dislike their tendency to toot their own horn so much"
1,There he goes again.,Paul Ehrlich has zero creditability. No wonder he is 'mad' and 'full of rage'. Science and Reason keep getting in the way of his religious beliefs about the environment.You would think that he would just be quiet out of a sense of shame. Read it for the laughs.
1,How does this guy face himself in the morning?,"Paul Erlich with his bomb ""Population Bomb"" has already established himself as one of the biggest fools in the history of the planet. Apparently, he is going for the title and this book is a big step in that direction. As they say, an ""expert"" is one who doesn't know that he doesn't know anything."
4,Good for debates,"The book was very interesting. I like how the Ehrlich went into extensive explanation to defy the information or brownlash that was published by the various anti-environmentalists. When the subjects were brought up, I tried to think whether I would be able to counter their quotes, let alone, whether what they were saying was believable. At times, I would not know what to answer, and thought that some of their comebacks were believable, other times I knew there was something fishy, and occasionally, I was certain it was wrong.Regardless of the right or wrong in it, a great point to grab from this book is the lessons we can learn on how people can distort the facts to lean them towards their personal thinking or outcomes. Analyzing them and reading how they find the reasons behind their controversial remarks is very educative and useful for you personal debates.Great info and lessons here."
1,Caution: Before you read this:,"Before you read this book, read the Ehrlich's other runaway best seller--The Population Bomb. See how many of its predictions came true, and then decide whether or not you can trust this book. The Ehrlichs are the ""chicken littles"" of the late 20th century, and are dangerously interfering with the progress of a serious scientific debate."
4,Stokowski's live Beethoven's 9th comes 2nd after studio rec,"This is a great performance taken from a live concert within days of Stokowski's studio recording of the 9th symphony. The studio recording is available on Decca/London. This recording would be essential if that studio recording had not been made. However, the studio recording is much better recorded, slightly broader in tempo and just as great a performance. Thus I would recomend this for those particularly interested in live Stokowski or those like myself who like to compare live and studio recordings of the same piece/same conductor."
1,"A Modern-Day ""Plan 9""","C Me Dance's hilarious ineptitude rivals even the worst works of Ed Wood himself. After finishing the film, I genuinely questioned whether or not the creators actually intended to create a serious work. Of course, a quick Google search has confirmed that the creators genuinely intended to create a good film. This fact makes C Me Dance all the funnier.Despite my one-star rating, I do highly recommend that you buy this film. (I'd like to see Greg Robbins make enough money to create another one of these masterpieces.) Watch C Me Dance with a group of friends and laugh out loud at one ridiculous situation after another.[If you don't believe that this film is as bad as I say, look online for the trailer. It's epic.]"
4,C Me Dance,"Hi,As far as I can recall this movie portrays the most realistic viewpoint of the daily, weekly, battle we all face. I'm sure most people know around the world that evil is real. Evil influences our culture quite a bit, and their is the opposite Love and Holiness. That sure appear to be polarizing in our cultures. This Movie seems to be one of the best representations of this battle in and through life and death. A have to admit it helped me be a better warrior of love and power.I have stumbled and am stunned to have found that God is tangibly real. :) If you want to see a skeptics video documentary of finding the realness of God by filming throughout the world. Check out Filming God, and the Finger of God filmed by Darren Wilson. Entertaining to say the least."
3,More like a 3.5,"This movie left me scratching my head in a few places. Was that because I lacked the smarts to unravel the complexities or was it simply a case of flaky scenes? I realize the mystical elements will offend some, but will attract others but this movie perhaps wandered a little over the double yellow line. There is precedent for the Holy Spirit falling on people during times of revival. However I have never seen Biblical precedent for ridding a person or place of Satan without invoking the name of Jesus Christ. A simple ""Get Out"" by a pastor is not going to accomplish the task. I like what this movie was attempting to accomplish - not sure they got r done."
1,Piece of JUNK!,"o.k. I'm a HUGE survivor fan and a huge computer buff..so i was estactic to get this game! I got this game as a Christmas gift and when i tried it... it didn't work! I finally got it to work and it was junk! The graphics were terrible (not to mention SLOW) and the communication was worthless. Then, it froze! I returned it at least 5 times to see if I could at least get to the merge. It never worked although our computer met all of the requirements. Trust me, don't buy this game unless you have a lot of patience!"
1,Terrible-actually get no point/star,"I have no word with this one. The title doesn't show much of the meaning of this game. Check it out at Gamespot and you'll, never recommend for anyone, even the one who really likes the show."
4,only if your a fan of the show,This is a good program but if you are not a fan of the show I wouldnt get it. What I didnt like was the part when they talk to each other. It is canned typed speech. If you are a fan of the show get it.
5,works great,"We bought one of these 2 years ago for our old fridge that does not have a built in filter for the ice maker. Has lots of different fittings to work in different situations, and lasted 2 years before the water started tasting off."
4,be prepared!,"With the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina & Rita, being prepared for calamity is much on everyone's minds, Rebeccasreads recommends RESILIENCY IN THE FACE OF DISASTER & TERRORISM as a no flourishes guidebook of information on preparing yourself & surviving.In 10 fast & succinct chapters you will learn how to determine what might happen in your life: injury - heart attack - wildfire - car crashes - earthquakes - domestic violence - rape - illness - storms - tornadoes - shooting - flash floods - robbery - terrorism - poverty, among many...- what to expect- how to prevent- how to prepare- how we react- when to get help- help yourself- help othersNational & personal Armaggedons can come at any time -- life is dangerous, no matter where we live nor how poor/rich we are -- learning from this book & getting you & your family prepared will help you sleep at night."
1,RIP OFF,"I can't believe this DVD is even legal. It is a rip off of the other two Van Halen DVDs... The photo on the ad shows Eddie from the 2007/2008 tour. THIS DVD IS NOT FROM THAT TOUR. Amazon, you would do well to drop this from your listings. I returned my copy for a full refund. I recommend others don't even buy this one. Get the other two DVDs, Right Here Right Now and Live Without A Net. Way better quality and not disguised as something they are not. I give this one a 0 out of 5 stars but I had to select a 1 to get the review to go through."
4,Searching,"Mr. Numan was still looking for a style to call his own on this album, which helps rather than hinders. He's obviously playing the post-punk here, with those oblique sci-fi-ish lyrics you either love or hate, but his dabbles in keyboards and acoustics make for a good collection."
5,A Robot Sings Punk,"Gary Numan's career defining moment is the hit ""Cars"". This album is the album before the album before. Punk was hot, and Gary Numan wanted a recording contract, so he made a punk album.Fans will bore you with the the turns in his career, but I think this is one of three essential albums by Gary Numan, which happen to be his first three, starting with this one. Gary has perfected his disaffected, robotic delivery. The songs are very good -- hooky skewed lyrics about death, disassociation, technology etc. I would even give him a nod for a decidedly hendrix influenced guitar playing.You get some live stuff as well on this album, I wish the quality of the live stuff was better -- Numan covering White Light/White Heat is great.IF you are filling out your late 70's brit punk music collection, and don't have this already, get it. It is really unique, and Gary Numan kind of disparages it now, but it is really some of his best work."
5,Three Classics?,"It wasn't clear to me from the description whether or not this item contained three separate and individual hardcover books, or if this was a single ""three-in-one"" book with all the pieces bound together. I am happy to report that the item has three separately-bound and individual hardcover books."
5,Great service,I received the package promptly and books were in excellent condition. They were exactly what I had hoped to receive. It was easy too!
3,NOT 100% Acrylic NOT Acrylic blend but 100% polyester says the blankets tag,"I tried to review this blanket before with the complaint that when I purchased the blanket it was advertised as 100% acrylic when I received the blanket it was 100% polyester according to the tag. Don't get me wrong it is very soft and looks beautiful.My husband and I own 100% Acrylic blanket and I wanted to buy this for my sister for her birthday I wanted her to have the luxury of acrylic. When I received it I was very happy with the quality and the look and feel of the blanket HOWEVER,I read THE DISAPPOINTING tag. Other then the incorrect advertisement.it is a nice blanket. I did keep it but to be honest I would not have bought it if I knew it was not 100% acrylic.Would I buy it again? It is possible...As I said it is a nice blanket."
3,"Dry, very technical and hard to follow at some points - but good basic introduction","I'm a strategic sourcing professional and consult to numerous clients on the topic, however, all my knowledge and experience has come from ""on the job"" learning and experience. I decided to buy this book in order expand my knowledge and provide more structure to what I know. The content of the book is succint, however, most topics were covered in a very general and sparse capacity. In addition, I also found the text dry, technical and at some points, my eyes were plain crossing as I was trying to read what was being presented. It provides a very decent overview, but for someone who's been working in strategic sourcing for any number of years, I would suggest another book since this is very much an introductory text. It is also very theoretical, so if you are looking for the practical ""how-to"" of strategic sourcing, or anything relating more towards the process of strategic sourcing, look elsewhere."
1,Problem with Use with Treo 680,"The Mobile 20 is excellent at tracking to a destination. The touch input is excellent. However, there appears to be serious system fault, probably in the software, that results in major interference when voice directions are activated. This renders the voice guidance useless. Due to the small mapping screen, properly functioning voice guidance is critical to use of the Mobile 20."
3,got a a garmin 10x instead.,I wanted somthing that will work on my cell phone and pda so i ended up returning this one and got something else. Garmin 10X
4,Garmin 20 looses voice,My Garmin 20 for Motorola Q has forgotten how to talk as soon as I put the phone in the mount. Otherwise I like it. But this is a biggy. I tried to get help on-line but the web page for that purpose crashed when I tried to send my message.
1,"If it worked, it would be nice...","I have had a very poor experience with the GPS 20 and my 700W. The handsfree calling and bluetooth for that works great, however the GPS (the main reason for buying) is non-functional. If trying to start the program, it will endlessly seach for the software never to find it. Even when working, it did not have enough memory to navigate a 5 mile route. Just spend the money to get a GPS unit and a hands free bluetooth device and you will be much happier."
2,"Flawed assumptions lead to mixed results, at best.","Posner's thesis in this case begins with the assumption of rationally acting individual humanist subject that, although perhaps defensible in the 18th century, has since been seriously challenged by empirical study and theory in the social sciences as well as contemporary philosophy and jurisprudence. Often critical of other professionals who stray out of their area of expertise, Posner has no qualms about playing psychologist, even in the abcence of empirical support. There are some sharp ideas presented here, but I doubt Posner will revolutionize health policy in this case."
3,Not what I expected,"Because of the price I thought this would be the deluxe version with data recovery. It is not, it's the basic 3 year protection, at the deluxe version price."
2,hope i never have to use it,"seems, nice, I just hope i never really have to use the thing.Got my labtop stolen, that's the first thing these ***** want to do, and then their out.So I am trying to be smarter, so i bought this also, I just felt like I had to do it.I just pray I never really have to use what I bought the thing for."
1,Not happy at all,I bought this in May and only used it twice. Now it is not working. I just wish Garmin could make an adapter that will work.
3,power adaptater,Is the 12-volt vehicle DC power adaptater being a subset of the automotive suction cup mount for Zumo ?.
4,Garmin mount Zumo 550,Great service order thru delivery. Garmin of course is perfection in GPS products. Zumo 550 still the best for portability motorcycle to ATV to car to snowmobile.
3,Only for Professionals!,"While this book must be a well-written professional work on its topic, I found most of this book a bit too dry and scholarly to be of interest to the average reader like myself.Still, it does contain otherwise hard to find information on the modern society of the Tanimbar Islands (especially of the Fordatan ethnic group) of Southeast Maluku."
3,Light reading for those familiar or unfamiliar with Latin,"Carpe diem - Seize the day! Mortuo leoni, etiam lepores insultant - Rabbits may pull dead lions by the beard. Operi Dei nihil praeponatur - Let nothing be preferred to the Work of God.This short, small book is filled with common and not-so-common Latin phrases perfect for meditation. Each phrase includes an English translation and is followed by a brief commentary on the saying.Readers will particularly enjoy the lesser-known phrases, and the encouraging words of Saints Augustine and Thomas Aquinas.In the process not only will you learn something about your faith, but you might also pick up a little Latin."
5,Wonderful Condition,My used book was in wonderful condition. Father Reilly is an old family friend. I am so glad to find this book on Amazon. This is a book of insight for those who wish to grow spiritualy. Thank you.
2,Not one of Last's better DVDs,"This is not one of James Last's better videos. The scenery is gorgeous, but the singers appear to be lip-syncing. The best song was done by a Jamaican steel drum group."
4,"Fun, but definitely prerecorded","I bought this for my stepfather because he loves James Last. This one was not as good as ""Gentleman of Music"" and the other concert DVDs. It's obviously prerecorded and being lip-sung (sp?), and there are women wearing very small swimsuits that should not be. However, the songs are lively, the people are lively, it's out on the beach, and it's still James Last (although he has a very small part in it).Gentleman of Music"
5,dont mind if i do,"This is Culture Club at its best. Check out ""Sign Language"", ""Maybe I'm a fool"", ""Your kisses are charity"", ""Truth behind her smile"". This is an awesome album. If only it were properly marketed you would surely have been singing along and tapping your toe to these gems, what a welcome relief to the fabricated stuff you're hearing now on the radio. If you've ever liked a Culture Club song and haven't gotten this album yet..get it..its worth every cent. Unfortunatly its only on import so get it while you can...I can't tell you how many people who have heard this Love It and are impressed with the results..I love it and always include a track or two on any cd I burn for friends or family.Goerge has never sounded better and the combination of the original group shines through bringing magic to the mix..not to be missed."
2,Some Comebacks R Not Worth Coming 2!,"Now PLEASE don't get me wrong. I was a teen in the 80's, and Culture Club was the BEST by far. But after listening 2 this album, they should have just said goodbye after VH1 Storytellers. Now just so u don't think I'm totally bashing this album, out of the 15 tracks, only 4 of them r worth listening 2: ""I Just Wanna Be Loved"", ""Strange Voodoo"" (my personal favorite), ""See Thru"" and ""Fat Cat"". 2 possible xceptions: ""Mirror"" would b good for a new Austin Powers sequel, and ""Black Comedy"" would ONLY b good if the disco era of the 70's were 2 make a strong comeback. So coming from a CC fan...let the buyer beware on THIS one!"
2,Some Comebacks R Not Worth Coming 2!,"To those reviewers b4 me who (4 some warped reason) gave this album 5 stars, all I can say is, ""WHAAT!?"" Now PLEASE don't get me wrong. I was a teen in the 80's, and Culture Club was the BEST by far. But after listening 2 this album, they should have just said goodbye after VH1 Storytellers. Now just so u don't think I'm totally bashing this album, out of the 15 tracks, only 4 of them r worth listening 2: ""I Just Wanna Be Loved"", ""Strange Voodoo"" (my personal favorite), ""See Thru"" and ""Fat Cat"". 2 possible xceptions: ""Mirror"" would b good for a new Austin Powers sequel, and ""Black Comedy"" would ONLY b good if the disco era of the 70's were 2 make a strong comeback. So coming from a CC fan...let the buyer beware on THIS one!"
5,Maybe I'm A Fool...,"I hadn't heard of this album until I bought the Greatest Hits DVD to see all those early 80s videos that I remembered. I saw that the DVD contained updated material but dismissed it as the generic effort you usually get from old bands on a greatest hits album/DVD. It only took one run through of the new videos though to see that this was not filler! I found the songs playing in my head more than the older material. I had to have the CD at that point. No regrets on this one...the album contains 15 songs (more than the usual fare) and none are disposable! It's really good to hear a band that doesn't just stand still in time and can still include the reggae sound they did so well and it sounds so fresh. The Boy's voice is rich and outstanding and never sounded better, along with the production--very impressive! Virgin really missed the boat on this one!"
4,A must-have for any Boy George fan,"I'm sure it goes without saying that if you're not really a Boy George / Culture Club fan, you probably won't like this CD. If you really loved their music, it's a nice mix. Being honest, it sounds as though he'd lost some of his range by the time this was recorded... but it's still good & I love him anyway!"
5,Excellent intro,"All Mark Link books in this series are really wonderful.This one is a perfect intro to the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius.A very accessible and gently challenging book. It caused me towant to make changes in my life and seek a more challengingversion, which I am working through now....Bergan's Take andReceive series."
1,Did not help,"I ordered this book thinking it was a ""Guide"" to Mauritania (as the title indicates). Unfortunately, it was little more than a pamphlet that gave very sketchy information about schools in Mauritania.... totally worthless to me. I would not recommend this book to anyone... WAY overpriced for the very small amount of information that it contains."
4,"I loved this book, but...","This book contains some very solid, practical ways of starting up a spiritual practice devoted to the Magdalene. Unfortunately I could not get past the whole ""let's throw Kali, Sekhmet, Hecate, and the Magdalene into a blender!"" concept that she tries to sell. None of these goddesses have a thing in common with the Magdalene except maybe their gender. I would've loved to have seen some genuine cross comparisons and rituals between her and very similar goddesses who are equally as popular, and would've made far more sense to include: Isis, Astarte, Aphrodite, Ishtar, and Inanna are just a few I can rattle off the top of my head. I think that she is trying to market this book for the type of person who would be much happier picking up a book on Teen Wicca. Nonetheless, this book has a lot of excellent ideas in it and I found that the information included was just what I was looking for--when I ignored all of the ""dark godddess"" nonsense, that is."
5,The new War Machine CD is a high Energy Kick (...),"The new War Machine LP is a high energy kick (...). Everytime I hear it my blood pumps, and boils. I have known War Machine for quite sometime, and I have to say, this is by far their best material to date. It's Metaly, it's funky, it's heavy, it Slams, It hits you like a freight train right between the eyes. If you haven't picked up this CD, you need to, it will go down as the definitive Cyber-Techno-Industrial-Metal Album for years to come."
3,A dissapointment...and a slight return.,"After his extraordinary debut album, ""Whiskey"" and the just as good second ""Tatoo"", both extraordinary, J.J. Johanson flopped. He flopped mainly because he didn't know how to continue the succesful path he had run into.The vocals in """"Poison"" are as good as the ones in the two former albums. The problem, in my opinion, lies in a lack of the mood he had us accustomed to and in the drums: almost all the songs are infected with a very horible and clichéed hip-hop pattern that becomes dull and repetitive. It's a shame...and a pitty.""La Confusion des Genres"", on the other hand, is the soundtrack for a French film and in a way (constrained by the soundtrack status of the album) is a sort of comeback to the J.J. we liked in the first two albums: shadowy, minimal and intense.Let us hope he releases a new album as promising as it deserves to be."
4,"A Forgotten Artist from the ""ME"" Decade","It is highly appropriate that Brown, like so many of his disco contemporaries, has drifted into pop music obscurity. Even his first LP did not feature his photo on the cover because as a white artist whose music had a definite ""black sound,"" his record label chose to keep his identity hidden.Well, the music is what is important, and Brown, like fellow label-mates KC and the Sunshine Band, was a hit-maker for the times. The disc features the disco hits ""Do You Wanna Get Funky with Me,"" ""Dance With Me,"" and ""Crank It Up."" However, Brown did compose a moving ballad ""Without Love,"" also here, that shows his more reflective side.Not one of the major stars of the era, Brown, though does have his following. And I happen to be among that bunch."
2,"Very basic, not for techies","An excellent introduction and overview of XML for non-technical people, primarily managers and others chiefly concerned with ROI and the business implications of XML. All but the most novice developers, however, will find this video way too basic. Too many talking heads, and a mediocre use of visual examples. In fact, there's little here that couldn't have been covered as easily in an audiotape or book. A ""sequel"" of this video for developers already familiar with XML would be most welcome."
3,A Good CD to burn or borrow from a friend,"This cd contains many very good tracks, and also contains a few obviously ""filler tracks."" While I must admit that I was initially disappointed by the newly found mellowness of the Foo Fighters, many of their slow songs are quite well done.Let me reiterate the point that this is by no means a bad album, and is actually a very good album. However, I would reccomend Millencolin's ""Pennybridge Pioneers"" for those who preferred the more punk/melodic sound of ""The Colour and the Shape"", Third Eye Blind's ""Blue"" or self-titled release for those looking for a similar (yet better) sound than TNLTL, or the extremely unheralded and critically unacclaimed ""Adore"" from the Smashing Pumpkins for those quiet moments of ""pop introspection."""
5,They keep getting better,"I have had this album for a long time, listened to it over and over, and I still think it's a great album. They're a great rock band, lots of fun. If you're a fan of RHCP, you'll probobly love the Foo Fighters, too."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Maybe it's just me, be this album is somewhat disappointing. What I really miss, is the feeling of daze that its predecessor left with me. The spontaneous, edgy, surprising element is gone, unlike 'The Colour & The Shape'. Most of the songs are rather sweet, it just sounds to mainstream to me. Sure, there are some good tracks on it, like Break Out, Generator, and Learn To Fly. But on the whole, this CD does NOT live up to the expectations its predecessor left us with..."
2,They're losing there touch.,There Is Nothing Left To Lose is an appropriate title for this CD because obvioulsy the Foo Fighters lost everything before they wrote the CD. They now are falling into trends of other bands as well as repeating there first two CDs. They play what seems to be the same song for all 11 songs.
5,Foo Fighters,"This is a great CD sung by the Foo Fighters. It is their best yet. The songs are highlighted by Stacked Actors, Breakout, and Learn to Fly. i would recomend this song to everyone who likes good rock with no cursing."
5,Well Diversed,I really don't understand how some people can give this album less than 5 stars. Did they listen to a different album? I for one think this is one of the best rock albums of the year. Out of the 11 songs on the album I only dislike 1 and that's pretty amazing for any album. The Foo Fighters prove that you don't need a dj to make a good rock album
5,one of the most amazing albums to come out in the last 10yrs,"dave grohl and company have done it again.just when you thought you had the sound figured out they throw a 70s style guitar heavy drenched classic album on you.theres not much good going on in music these days,but i guess there is really nothing left to lose for these guys.it just goes to prove..be true to yourself.its stripped down out and out rock and roll at its finest,a MUST have for every real rock fan."
2,Mostly boring,"Having listened to and loved the Colour and the Shape, a powerful, rocking album with great riffs and bursts of anger juxtaposed with lovely melodies and smooth vocals, I really looked forward to hearing this album. The first song, Stacked Actors boded well, containing exactly the same mix that made the Colour and the Shape one of the best albums ever, with a healthy dose of catchiness too. From there on, however, I was dissapointed. It's not a bad album, but perhaps thats the problem - the songs are mostly weak and quite boring. Learn to fly is good, as is Gimme Stiches (which has an incredible riff), but apart from that Foo Fighters seem to have run out of energy. I suppose it might work as a hook to get pop lovers into something a bit rockier, but if you like good rock I suggest you forget this and buy the Colour and the Shape instead, and hope their next album will be a bit rockier."
3,A couple of good songs,I'll try to make this review short and sweet....This cd has a couple of good songs... the rest aren't so good. so depending on howmuch you like those few good songs... it may or may not be worth a buy.
3,Worst Foo Fighter Disc,"This record was a disappointment for me; especially following up The Colour and The Shape. Stacked Actors is probably the best Foo song ever, but after that it's a pretty weak record. Sure there are some Highlights to follow (Aurora, Ain't it the Life), however they are few and far between. Learn to Fly is the closest Dave Grohl has ever come to selling out completely (although they may be making fun of theirselves), and Breakout is just NOT COOL.In addition, this is the only Foo Record that has 100% completely unmemorable songs on it. Live-In-Skin, Headwires, and Gimme Stiches are pointless, uninspired tunes. Generator and Next Year are songs that my girlfriend likes a little too much. And all in all, the last half of the record is all Easy Listening Ballads......sorry. I love the foo fighters too."
1,1 song can't save 11,"I bought this album in good faith after buying the other two FF cd's years ago. It opens with ""Stacked Actors"", an extremely cool song, but from there, it's just a bunch of duplicating 80's Fleetwood Mac-esqe pop. The truth? One song cannot save an album, and apparently, even Dave Grohl can't save this one. And to the guy who said ""Down with Nirvana"" or whatever, without Nirvana, we could still be listening to boring sludge like There is Nothing Left to Lose."
2,SAFE BORING POP,"Just broke this CD out again as I was bored with all my current music and wanted to take a chance- as I remembered this is the Foo's worst effort- very poor follow-up to the excellent The Colour and the Shape. It's nothing but a bunch of safe, cheesy, boring, pop rock songs that break no new ground or ever go anywhere- even Aurora, which is the best on the CD and a concert fav is average at best. One by One brought back the edge a bit, this one is not worth the time."
2,hmph,"'learn to fly' and 'generator' are decent songs. Maybe download them somewhere, and save your money. The rest of the album is not really worth hearing."
1,What went wrong with the Foo Fighters?,"This used to be my favorite band. I never got tired of The Colour and the Shape but I cannot even listen to this cd. ""Stacked Actors"" is probably one of their best songs but all the others either suck or are just ok. I don't mind if they want to change their style as long as the songs are still good, and they are not. I sold my copy."
3,"Bright Spots, but Inconsistent","My experience with this CD started out very positive - after twelve years of buying CDs, it became only the fourth out of about 800 that I bought after hearing only ONE song only ONCE. ""Learn to Fly"" was that song - simple but powerful, one of those songs that seems instantly familiar, like it's been one of your favorites for years.Unfortunately, I suppose I imagined the rest of the CD would be as good. It's not. ""Stacked Actors"" is quite good, and I admit to a fondness for ""Ain't It the Life."" But the rest of it is pretty standard stuff - almost rote, as if the Foos were writing and recording everything they wrote without stopping to consider if it fit or was really of high quality.I love the Foos, and look forward to a chance to see them live someday, but other than ""Learn to Fly,"" I really hope they stay away from this CD's material in concert."
4,A Half Step Down from Previous Work,"I'd call this the least essential of the Foos' first three albums, but that's more a testimony to how good the previous ones are than any real rip on this one. Dave Grohl seems determined not to even accidentally have another crossover Hot AC hit by keeping all the songs in the rock category, and most of them are quite good. A few too many repeated choruses start to annoy me here and there, but that's a minor quibble. A bit more stylistic variety couldn't've hurt, either. Early faves are the excellent ""single"", ""Learn to Fly"", as well as ""Aurora"" and ""Gimme Stitches"". You may want to start with their previous work, but you won't be disappointed by this one."
5,Great Rock CD,"This is a fantastic CD by the 'Foo Fighters'. 'There is Nothing to Lose' shows talents in all areas. ""Stacked Actors"", ""Learn to Fly"" and ""Generator"" are really cool songs. 'There is Nothing to Lose' is a great CD. Five out of five stars."
4,you have nothing to lose with this one...,"Just got it in the mail two days ago. Although not the best CD overall, this is pretty darn good! Every track on this gem is catchy, especially ""Learn To Fly"". For some reason, Grohl and company remind me of Sugar (Bob Mould's old band) and the Smithereens. But so what! This is solid alt-rock with melodic hooks at its best!"
4,A breath of fresh air.,"Having been dissapointed with the recent crop of rock albums, I bought this one with reservations. I do agree that the album is not as good as ""The Color and the Shape"", but I was pleasantly surprised at this offering. The Foo Fighters are still very solid rockers, and they haven't lost their knack for those memorable ballads. I love the way Dave Grohl can sing sentimental songs without drowning you in overly sappy pop(Can anyone say Goo?) While repeated listenings have begun to dull my instant affection for the album (the hooks are a little too repetitive) I still think this is a very solid offering and is well worth your money."
4,Dave Does Not Dissapoint,"I've always loved the Foos....not only because the roots of some of the band members come from a beloved Nirvana, but because they took something from that music and transcended it to become harmonic punk....hard edged pop - that certainly is not the case with most of the dull monotony heard on the airwaves these days. Their music on this CD appears to be a little more pop oriented than their last efforts, but is still worthy listening by far. The best thing about the Foos is they don't take themselves too seriously - they write impressive rock-n-roll and still have fun. Just check out the ""Learn to Fly"" video for proof!"
3,Nothing Left To Lose...Not Now Anyway,"The Foos do it again! Erm...um...well maybe not.After an impressive self-titled debut in 1995, and a strong follow up in 1997 (The Colour And The Shape), the Foo's third long player is somewhat of a disappointment. The Grohl growl and snarl that punctuated the Foo's prior albums is achingly absent here. Grohl trades in the boot-stomping rockers with FM radio melodic pop. The results themselves aren't entirely disastrous, but from what the Foo's have shown us, this album is a step in unknown territory. One only hopes Grohl knows what he's doing.'There Is Nothing Left To Lose' is not a bad album. Songs like 'Aurora' and 'Stacked Actors,' remind us why we liked these guys in the first place. And even if this one isn't as great as the other two, it still makes for a worthwhile and listen."
5,Dave Grohl is amazing,"A truly musical CD. Seldom do you hear rock this intense that is so melodic and musical. Dave Grohl is a genius. It actually reminds me melodically of stuff from the Beatles.. very creative, great hooks. Rock music as it should be. If you don't buy this CD, you're nuts."
3,Pretty nifty album.,"I am not sure what I thought of the Foo Fighters before purchasing this CD. I heard a few songs, most of them are featured in the album above, but I could not decide if this is really a band I am going to like.I bought the CD approx. a week ago, and have been listening to it non-stop since. Songs that will stick in your head are probably ""Ain't it the Life"" or ""M.I.A"". Songs that you'll want to hit play on many times would be ""Learn to Fly"", ""Aurora"" and ""Live in Skin"". The rest of the songs will just keep your head moving to the beat.I recommend this album to anyone who likes the style, they're good at what they do."
3,The best driving album of 1999,"This may be the best driving album of 1999, with big rock riffs galore, a pounding rhythm section, and melodic hooks all over the place. It all works without going over the top into heavy metal or hard grunge. There are some daft lyrics here, so don't listen too closely, but the quieter songs near the end may give us a glimpse into the songwriter that Dave Grohl can be."
5,THIS CD ROCKS--BUT GET STP FIRST,"When I first heard this cd, I decided it was great so I got in my truck and gup-dang got my tuccous down to tower and bought me a cd."
4,great disc from foo fighters,"The foo fighters are a band that has come a long way starting from it origins in the ashes of nirvana and through different line up changes. Despite the many changes, the band has always been a good rock band to listen to. Nothing left lose follows that tradition. There are songs that are more hard rock like MIA and Breakout as well as softer songs like learn to fly and live in skin."
3,A Mellower Outing From Grohl & Co.,"This is one of those tricky albums that comes along every once in a while. You know the type: not as good as the rest of the artist's catalogue (There Is Nothing is not on the same level as Foo Fighters and especially not The Colour and The Shape) but containing some of their very best songs (""Generator"", ""Aurora"") nonetheless. After three albums, it seems like Grohl has, on certain songs this time around, started to slightly repeat himself . And while this is dangerous ground for sure, it places him and his bandmates at the artistic crossroads that his former band faced, but never resolved: to continue making the same album on and on; or slowly go into other directions. It would seem that the Foos have already opted for the latter: the mellower and poppier sounding There Is Nothing is obviously a clue as to where they might be heading. One thing is certain: Wherever that may lead, I know I'll stick around."
3,A Pretty Good CD but not the Best,I liked this cd. It has it's hard rock and it's softer rock moments but it is a good cd. Learn To Fly is the best song on the album and if you aren't really a Foo Fighters fan I'd consider just buying the cd single. Breakout is also a good song. The rest of the songs are just OK.
4,Great CD but lacks as much innovation as earlier,"This is a pretty good CD overall, but most of the reviewers are right in that it just doesn't have nearly as much unique and innovative stylings as some of the earlier work by the Foo Fighters. However that is not a reason not to get this album. The tracks are still very good overall. Learn to Fly though obviously meant to be a poppy song meant for the charts is still kind of nice and I like to listen to it. Though I think my favorite track on the album for both its sound and lyrics is Ain't it the Life, which is just a great song all around. And despite my earlier comments there is still enough innovation to make this a worthwhile choice."
2,mediocre,"If you'd like to get a Foo Fighters disc, get ""Colour and the Shape"" - one of the best discs of the 90s. Unfortunately there isn't a song on their latest disc that's as good as anything on ""Colour."" This late 1999 release got one play on my CD player, and then was put into the CD rack, afterwhich I went back to listening to ""Everlong,"" ""My Hero,"" and the remainder of ""Colour."" This is not a terrible disc, just not great."
1,Too popish and not enough rock,Some songs were alright. But overall it's a major disapointment...the sound is simply too poppy for me. I'm not exactly sure what the foo fighters are going for with this sound...but it's not working for me....I hate it when I waste my money
1,Echte Enttäuschung,"Ich kann nur jeden warnen ! Kauf Dir nicht die CD. Die Colour and Shape war genial. Eine meiner Lieblingscds. Aber die hier ist Müll. Immer wenn sie mal andeuten, jetzt wirds gut (in Live-In Skin und der Refrain von M.I.A) , ist das nur ein kurzes Aufflammen. Echt enttäuschend !"
2,The Foo Sell Out...or......The Foo's Turn Goo,"It's a cryin shame that one of the last remaining true rock and roll bands are quickly spiraling into sappy pop schmaltz ala the Goo Goo Dolls. The first two cuts are vintage Foo and rock, but after that, it's a snoozer. Mainstream MTV adicts will love this, but rockers look elsewhere, namely the Hellacopters, Unida, and High on Fire."
3,Too......indifferent,"I don't think I'm gonna be able to figure this album out for a while. On one hand, theres the fact that I love the Foo Fighters and their past two albums are amazing...but then on the other hand, I can't seem to dig ""Learn To Fly"" and a lot of the other songs on the album. I mean, I realize that they have changed their sound a little bit and feel they have found a comfortable little niche for themselves, but the power and raw emotion from the past two albums is sorely lacking. Hopefully next round we'll get something that will appeal to those who really like this album and those who miss their old school Foo."
2,The Foo's have died.,"I can't believe whats on this album, i mean i was blown away by thier first two (especialy the first) but this album is so damn soft and poppy that it's embarassing. I expected the foo fighters to keep rocking, but they let me down...bigtime!"
3,As a Foo Fighters fan...,"I was real excited when this album came out. I really loved the first release and I thought this album was really going to put others to shame. When I got it, I was really disappionted. The only good songs were the first four. The rest of it is a collection of extremely slow, boring songs. I really loved their last album but this one was a letdown. So, if you're looking for an album that rocks, don't buy this one. If you really want to get a cool Foo Fighters album, get The Colour and the Shape."
4,pure pop for now people,"since bob mould and paul westerberg both threw up their hands and gave up trying to make high-octane pop-flavored rock and roll, someone had to fill the void. who'd a thunk it'd be dave grohl? this is the Sugar album Mould always wanted to make. it's a hook and great riff-laden jamboree. buy it, turn your brain off, turn the volume up and thank god it's still only rock and roll."
2,The energy is missing.,"I was hoping for the energy of their last album. Unfortunately, that energy is gone. Many mellow tunes, but frankly, the music is boring."
4,FORGET NIRVANA,"DAVID GROHL'S BAND FOO FIGHTERS IS A BETTER LISTEN THEN HIS OLD OVERRATED BAND NIRVANA. THIS PURE ALT. ROCK AT IT'S FINEST. ""STACKED ACTORS"", ""LEARN TO FLY"",""GIMME STITCHES"", ""AURORA"" (SOUNDS SO LATE 70'S EARLY 80'S TO ME), ""LIVE-IN SKIN"" AND SHOULD BE CLASSIC ""HEADWIRES"". I MOSTLY LISTEN TO THE ROCK OF 60'S, 70'S, BUT THERE ARE SOME BANDS IN THE 90'S THAT CAN GET INTO MY HEAD, AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM."
2,Listenable Rock FM,"The third Foo Fighters album is a well produced product that isn`t bad enough to be repulsive neither too interesting or solid to be considered good. It ends up being an average,decent-but-nothing-special record, that still is better than most of the stuff on the radio. Most of the songs here are alright and amusing, however they lack complexity and sound too poppy and predictable, never leaving familiar ground. It isn`t too risky or innovative, even if some moments, like ""Generator"", are worth a listen. All in all, ""There Is Nothing Left To Lose"" is another presentable rock album with a few nice songs and a lot of filler material. It could have been worse."
5,"Lyrically, the best album in years","David Grohl has written some of the best lyrics that rock music has seen since Kurt Cobain died. His songwriting has underestimated since Foo Fighters started. This album seprates him form Kurt Cobain;'s shadow. Foo Fighters have a life of their own, and with this album they have a place in rock history. They are no longer poping out a few singles from the leftovers of grunge, they are changing the direction of rock music without falling into the rap/rock trend."
4,Excellent Mainstream Rock album,"The Foo Fighters have never been a groundbreaking band, they haven't rewritten rock and roll, and they probably never will. The fact is, however, that Grohl can write damn good songs, and the FOO Fighters have put out three great albums. This one is the best. Yes, it is more poppy, no, it doesn't have that punk sound anymore. The fact is that Dave has turned to past inspirations from the 60s and 70s to create an excellent modern rock album. He has enough tricks up his sleaves to keep fans interested,although these are just standard rock songs. And yes, this album is worth your hard earned cash. You won't get sick of it. It has been in my cd player since I bought it when it was first released."
4,Pretty good cd...,"I may not be an expert on the Foo Fighters or music in general, but I know what I like- ""Learn to Fly"" is a really well-written song, ""Breakout"" is just plain awesome, and I really like the song ""Gimme Stitches"" (nice melody). The rest of the songs are pretty good- they're not too hard or ""out there"", if you know what I mean. I really haven't listened to the album enough to get the whole picture, but I would recommend this cd to anyone who liked ""Learn to Fly"" and ""Breakout"""
1,FOO-FIGHTERS SELL OUT AGAIN,"SELL-OUT,that is the word that can best describe the foo-fighters. without kurt cobain, Dave Grohl would be working at working at some fast food place in seattle. without Kurt D. Cobain, Dave Grohl would be nothing. Dave Grohl doesn't even give a thank you to kurt or even mention the man who got him where he is in life. so dave grohl can just play some stupid alternivite songs forget about his past and act like he would be some great big rock star without KURT D. COBAIN! AND NIRVANA!"
1,Boooooriiiing!,"Me like tracks 1-3, goes down hill from there. That about sums it up. If you catch yourself enjoying this cd as a whole, check your tap water for drain-o content."
2,A Near Miss,"Not nearly as good as The Colour & the Shape. I loved every song on that CD, and bought this one in good faith. With the exception of ""Learn to Fly"" and ""Gimme Stitches"", I didn't really like any of the other songs. Maybe I'm just not a Foo Fighters fan...."
5,Rock (and mellow) out with this album!,"This is a great album. Each soing feels like a rock instrumental because every song has a guitars that you feel that are lyrics and the guitar is Dave Grohl's voice. But because of that, the album is made for the better. I reccomend this to any fan of rock or just guitars!"
4,DAVE AND CO. KEEP ROCKIN'.........,"This is not as good of an album as their last 'Colour' but it is a decent effort, and maintains their legacy after they were supposed to have not made it past one album (Nirvana). THe only bad thing about the album is there are nto enough rock songs, songs like 'Stacked Actors' and 'Breakout' are awesome and hopefully their next effort will focus on tunes like this rather than going in the mellow pop rock direction. IF you like the other two albums you will liek this after a couple listens, and if you take out the Nirvana shadow, the Foo Fighters will stay around for a long time, thank goodness......the best tunes are:1. Stacked Actors 2. Breakout 3. Learn To Fly 5. Generator 6. Aurora 9. Headwires"
4,"Listen to repeatedly, then see live, then appreciate 5 yrs down the line.","What else can I say, I didn't truly appreciate this album until I saw some of the material played live, like, ""Aurora."" Or, simply have low expectations when you first put the album in, and make sure you've heard none of the other Foo Fighters albums beforehand."
4,Good stuff from Dave and the guys,"I thought that this was the most ""accessible"" of all the Foo Fighters' albums. The music runs from being hard and heavy (Stacked Actors, Breakout) to mellow and lulling (Aurora, Next Year). The fact that i like both heavy and light music makes this cd easy to listen to, even though there is such a variety.And, even though it is very good, I thought that some of the last songs were filler and to light for my liking. Good work on the ECD part of the disc; I thought that was a nice gift for fans."
4,A pop masterpiece,"This album is simply brimming with excellent songs. Right from the word go the listener's attention is caught by the seething hooks of ""stacked actors"" which will certainly become a live favourite for as long as the foo foghters continue to play. The pure catciness of first single, ""Learn to Fly"" is a testament to the songwirting skills of Dave Grohl. ""Aroura"" sounds cosmetically similar to ""Everlong"" but has a more 'laid back' feel, and quickly moves into a weightless chorus more reminiscent of ""Walking after you"". The album continues in a strong fasion, without a single weak song, and closing track ""MIA"" will have you reaching for the repeat button the second it begins to fade out. Other stand out moments are ""Generator"", and ""Next Year"". All in all a strong all round performance, however the album fails to recapture the glory of ""the colour and the shape"", but is none the less a great album which i strongly reccomend."
3,Good CD- But not for the Foo Fighters,"I really wanted to fall in love with this album like I did the other 2. I really do enjoy some of the songs, but it sounds a bit too much like candy-arsed pop music to me. The Amazon review says that it is poppy, but with edge to it. There's a little edge, but not much. Don't get me wrong, some of my favorite Foo songs are slower, or more poppish (February Stars, Big Me), but this is an album full of Big Me's. I love the opening song and Learn to Fly, but the rest is merely okay in my opinion. Plus, the tattoo wore off too fast! :-D"
3,Side A had the Nirvana-like flair but Side B was weak.,I enjoyed the fast paced song Learn To Fly and the video accompanying it is hilarious. The song Aurora and Gimme Stitches were also impressive. I expected the album to be a little bit better but their previous album The Colour and the Shape would be hard to match. The second side sounded like it was thrown together quite fast as it cost the album a higher review. I wish the band would not have drowned out Grohl's vocals as it did on many tracks. The Foo Fighters are an excellent band but can never top any album Nirvana ever created.
4,"Not as Good as ""The Colous and Shape"",but still good","I am a huge Foo fan.Upon first listen to this album,i wasn't pleased.I gave it a few more spins and realized i liked it alot more,its just one of those albums you've gotta listen to a few times.Definetely a change,yet very good"
3,A happy medium,"This is a good album, not bad, not great, just good. Grohl can sing, the band can play. Don't expect the second coming of Nirvana, it's over. There's a few good songs on the cd, Learn to fly, Stacked actors, etc. Nothing earth shattering, just what you'd expect from the post grunge scene."
4,Nice.,"I've listened to the disc over and over. As a huge foo fan, I had to get it within the first hours of release. There first disc was a masterpiece. I say this ranks second. It takes time to grow on you but it's a good buy. The first six songs are excellent. ""Stacked Actors"" sets the stage with its intense crunchy riffs which gets you hooked to listen to it over and over. Great performers and a recommended buy. A very cool band. Go for it!"
2,I'm ever so dissapointed.,"The FF's were easily my favorite alternative or modern rock band or whatever before this album. But not anymore; something went terribly wrong.For my money, Live-In Skin is the best cut on the album, although a lot of people seem to think it's the worst. I call those people stupid. But anywho, Gimme Stitches is also a good song; Stacked Actors, Breakout, and Generator are decent, although Stacked Actors plays like a song that was written to be hard, which I don't like.As much as I hate to say it, I think that the Foos have taken a turn for the worse. Maybe it's because Pat Smear left. Maybe it's because they wrote all the songs for TINLTL in the studio. Maybe it's because on the first two albums, Dave Grohl actually did the drumming. Maybe my tastes have changed. Maybe I had a total frontal lobotomy yesterday. At any rate, if you're looking for ""intelligent rock,"" as I have seen it described, be wary: rocks are minerals and they don't have brains."
5,I wish I could give it six stars,"I have been a Foo Fan ever since I heard ""This is a Call"" in 1995. They are perhaps one of the greatest bands of all time, just they don't get their recognition, cuz of them stupid Backstreet Boys (who don't play instruments OR write their own music).I am a die-hard Foo fan, and this new album has no weak songs, except ""Live - In Skin"" which actually is pretty good. ""Learn to Fly"" is actually probably one of the weakest songs on the album.I can't believe they aren't gonna make a video out of ""Stacked Actors"", but reportedly one of ""Generator"".I really can't describe how great this album is in words, so please buy it if you have any appreciation for music."
2,Two stars due to dated material,"The book is really interesting, but in technology-time it is nearly a dinosaur. I give the authors great kudos for the initial product, but I was surprised given the content of the book that they have not published a newer version. That was the book I was looking to buy today but did not find. Hope to see it in the near future."
1,"Dated, waste of money","I read and studied this book and took the advice to heart. When I would go to the web addresses-I would get the ""Page Not Found"" message. Most of the websites did not exist. Websites that did and said that they were free, now charged a fee. One website even had removed the material stated in this book.I feel that I wasted my moneywith this book of useless information.The websites have changed-this book has dated material. This book is too old-it was not published recently.I am the author ofDreams in August: Life, Love, and Cerebellar Ataxia"
4,Romoulous Enterprises,This book has inspired me to market and sale my own books. It has also provided me with information and resources to publish my own books.
3,Good Book - Bad Links!,"After two years of promoting my first book using primarily offline tactics, this book opened up a broader market for my less than new title. Some of the articles sounded more self-promotional than reader-supportive, but I also came away with about a dozen ideas to apply to my online promotion of my self-published book (How To Make Your Business Run Without You) and will become part of my promotion of future books. As with many of the comments already stated, many of the site links no longer exist, yet this is not due to author neglect but to the speed of change on the internet. It would have been nice for the authors to list a link of their own that had updated resource information. Still -- for my [money], this was a good buy."
2,Disappointing...,"It just goes to show... yes, anyone can publish and sell a book, even if it's unorganized and full of repetitive, outdated, and technically incorrect/incomplete information (for example, why would anyone want to zip a PDF file--they're already compressed!). This book is a loose collection of articles; a few actually offer worthwhile information, but most are completely useless."
3,Great book for learning new treatments,I am a dental student at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland. I borrowed the book from a professor for reference while I created an online course on Masticatory Dynamics. I found Okeson's book to be well written with clear wording and adequate illustrations. It also helped me understand several different options available to treat a patient suffering from bruxism. A good reference.
4,"Cool, could be better, err easier","I gave this four stars for the following reasons:#1. When you wipe out the guy just slides across the ground, like he's tryin to make a new record for sliding the farthest on his chest protector.#2. It is hard to win a superbike race.#3. The bikes look like there generic, but the onw you get to race on looks like it is a cross between a ktm 400 sx and a husaberg 400.#4: hard controlsThe reasons I like it:good graphicsgood gameplayfun"
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my daughter. She keeps complaining about it. It runs and stops. You have to pick it up and shake it to make it run again. Sometimes, it rings in the middle. Sometimes, it doesn't ring at the end.Anyway, it just doesn't do what it is supposed to do."
2,Very cheap timer,"I just got this timer a couple weeks ago, and it's a little disapointing how cheap it feels. The plastic is thin and flimsy, and the mechanics don't inspire confidence - If I don't set it for more then 15 minutes it might not go off, and even if it does, it's not the loudest.I'm going to order another timer now, and this time I'll spend a few more bucks."
4,"tap your feet, ignore the end","The music in this film is fantastic. I sincerely reccomend buying the soundtrack. As for the actual film, it would be 3 stars, but I gave it 4 for the music and dancing. It's not that funny either. Well, about the plot, it's good up to the very end where it consisted mostly of Ashwaria crying and the hero looking very wimpy.However, americans seem to like that and it is an Ok introduction to bollywood for westerners."
3,Fun while it lasts,"We love these rafts, and fight over our turns in them in the pool, but they last at most two seasons. It's inevitable, I guess, because of the materials used around pools and how these plastic things get scraped around, but don't expect durability."
5,"Much, much better than the original versions",The songs made famous by Madonna re-recorded by women who can actually sing...What a concept!
3,Is it worth buying?,"Pretty good books as Web Programming books go, but do you need it? If you are taking a course and this is the text book then buy it, as good as any available...."
5,enlightening and detailed,"Considering I live about ten miles away from the author and visited her garden with my club last summer, one might not think me a very objective critic. And regarding this book, I'm probably not. I found the book full of good information about the perennials that florish here in unpredictable zone 5, and great suggestions for beautiful color combinations. The book is really for avid gardeners who are interested in further studies of particular plants and their cultivars, and the experiences of a gardener/artist who treats the garden as her canvas. She is a bit of a garden snob, and if you are partial to cutsey planters and other garden fixtures, don't bother with this book."
3,Caution Windows ME Users!,"Let me start by saying that my 4 year old son really like the game. Its good for basic math, spelling, and reasoning skills.The problem is that the installation process cripples Internet Explorer's encryption software! After installing, we could not use Internet Explorer to access any secured site (such as this one).The only way to correct was to restore the operating system.So, while the game is good, I can not run it on my Windows ME system."
3,Great but tempermental,"My four year old has loved this program! It's a great way to introduce setting goals and seeing a project through to its completion. Understanding relative sizes, phonics, and more gives her lots to choose from and doesn't bore her yet. The only problem is that with my operating system, WindowsME, this program is extemely unstable. It tends to crash and stall and has done so from the first day of operation. This is frustrating to her AND me, of course. Maybe other Windows systems work better."
5,The Best Reality Show To Date ! ! !,Wow The best reality show I ever seen.Capitan Watson Co-fonder of green peace left in the 70's because I think he was tired of diplomatic approach. Sure they will sign green peace papers and never whale again.?? Now he and others are taking a in your face action! Billions of people in this world and there is only maybe 35 people doing something about it. Imaginechildren opening there text books and reading about all extinct whales and watching past videos of them as they once existed.Hopefully not .Thank you Sea Shepherd.
3,just cause they're vegans doesn't mean they don't have a taste for blood,"Let's face it: Captain Paul Watson is a jerk. I don't care where you stand on the issue of whaling and animal rights. This attention-grabbing guy is shown on the TV series Whale Wars ($19.95; Animal Planet/Genius) unnecessarily risking lives, treating his committed crew of volunteers as disposable and basically doing whatever he can to promote the cause of ending whaling by any means necessary. (He found GreenPeace too wishy-washy, to give you an idea of his tunnel vision.) They throw themselves at any ships catching whales for any reason -- legal or not because they think it's wrong. I couldn't spend two minutes with the guy (who really is shameless in his zealotry) but it does make for some entertaining TV. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
2,Can't be used with a normal socket,I wish they'd made clear that you _have_ to rig up this light with a cord along a wall a hook.
2,Not worth it,These only lasted one year before getting holes and ripping. I will have to keep looking for something more durable. Although note mime were exposed to the sun and weather all year long.
2,He has better books.,"I like Wilson's Repairman Jack series, so bought this. Back when it was first published, it was probably great. But now, the storyline is old news, a plot rehashed over and over again on tv shows. I figured out the ""mystery"" a chapter in, which isn;t any fun. But if you never watch tv, this might be a great one! For all I know, his was the original and tv just stole his ideas over the last 20 years. (Check out his Repairman Jack stuff, though.)"
5,One of the Best Books Ever Written by Man,"As a homeschool mother I am intensely selective of the materials chosen to be curriculum. This book is required reading for all my children.It is annointed. What else is there to say?I highly reccommend it to all who love CHRIST JESUS as it was written by one of the most sincere, committed, and successful Christians who ever lived...a man who followed Christ and fulfilled JESUS's OWN WORD""They that believe in ME, the works that I do, shall they do also..."""
5,Best Book I Ever Read After the Bible,"This is a LIFE CHANGING book! I learned more from this book about faith and relationship with the Lord and dwelling in the Spirit than all the Christian books I have read put together. After reading some of the concepts I had to stop for some and dwell on the truth that was presented...""Man the Habitation of God"" for instance. Each chapter contains more wonderful knowledge than you can get from an entire book of watered down info today. It's packed with powerful stories of miracles in John G. Lake's life and the people he encountered. Even if it is a concept you already know, here is a man who put the concept into practice with great faith...so many people saved and healed..."
5,Totally blew me away,"Thank you so much to this seller.I got this book in just afew days.Excellent shape,with a thank you inside!!!!!Sharon"
2,A Fizzler,"Despite its humorous, well written start, Morgy fizzles into a ""list of stuff"" by the end. Written with simple, choppy sentences and too many undeveloped characters, this novel left us wondering where all the raves came from? What promises to show how a character changes and grows through a series of crises remains a series of crises...and Morgy, who feels like a hockey puck...stays one. He simply never makes his move! If you want a good book about ""moving"" and growing in a new location, try HEY, NEW KID...it's a winner."
5,Best floor mats money can buy,"I got a set of these for the front seats of my 2006 F250 CC. I'm in and out of the truck a LOT in the winter, and in some pretty muddy places the rest of the year, and these are just what I was waiting for. They cover the ENTIRE floor area from the seat brackets all the way to the top/front end of the carpet, the vertical part of carpet on the transmission hump, and all the way to the door molding - not a piece of unprotected carpet to be seen! The little ""pocket"" on the door side of the mat holds a pretty large amount of water, so even if you get in the truck with snow-covered boots and it all melts, it doesn't run off onto the carpet like other mats. The only issue I had was having to trim a bit off the edge with a razor blade in two places, where they didn't fit *exactly*."
1,not happy,"this came to me beat up, the package looked like it was open and very dirty. not satisfied.i thought the item was new, it wasnt it looked like someone returned. then you sold it to me."
3,"Worth buying for ""SIMON""","The title track ""Positivity"" is pretty weak IMO. Fans usually expect more from them than this.""One Love"" is decent, about on-par with much of what is on the full-length album (that is, underwhelming).""Simon"", on the other hand, is a great song. Great. It brings-back memories of 'the old Suede', that aching smooth balladry... it's ace. A seriously great song that trumps ANYthing on the new album.So, if you're a fan of ""DOG MAN STAR"" or ""COMING UP"", you may wish to invest in this."
2,You'd have less pain if you strung your guitar with fishing line.,"Let me just say, I absolutely love Elixir Strings. I have been using them almost exclusively for the past 10 years. I had never bought the Phosphor Bronze strings before, but decided to after seeing a 3-Pack on sale. The sound is great, but these are the toughest strings on your fingers. It's mostly the high E and B string, but they are ruthless. If you want to avoid pain in your fingers, stick with the regular Elixirs."
3,surprised I didn't like these strings,"I absolutely love Elixir Nanoweb strings, and before I started buying Elixir strings I frequently bought phosphor bronze strings of various brands. I was really excited when I found these. Unfortunately, I've been really disappointed with the tone, which I wouldn't describe as ""sweet"" at all as mentioned in the product description. Closer to ""dull,"" and difficult to hear in jam sessions, at least without amplification.Like their other nanoweb strings, they appear that they could last a long time without their sound changing much, which is the main reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 2. I have gone back to using Elixir's non-phosphor-bronze nanoweb strings, and will continue to be a loyal fan."
4,Great for the gym,"I have been using a Samsng YP-F1 since last Christmas 2005. As others have mentioned, its greatest attribute is size. I clip it to my shorts or slip it in a pocket and would never know it is there if it weren't for the music. This is a vast improvement over armbands, etc. Ipod may hold more songs, but it seems large and bulky in comparison.The stock earbuds are of high quality. I tried others, include some high end Koss buds, but come back to the stock items.Using i-tunes for music management works very well.The only down-side I have found so far is that the only way to recharge the battery is with the usb cable that plugs into a computer. My primary computer is a lap-top, which hybernates after 30 minutes, and the USB port goes down with it. I don't like to leave the laptop on for hours just to charge the mp3 player, so I'm looking for an alternative 4.5 to 5 volt charger....maybe Radio Shack...."
3,"50/50 GREAT PLAYER, BAD Playsforsure","I tend to have the smallest and most 'workout compatible' players available. This is the GREATEST WORKOUT player I have ever owned. It is perfect for working out, clips on anything, light and has all the features needed... but it claims to be playsforsure enabled, but after sending this unit back to be fixed 3 times it has come back to me 3 times and has not worked! FRUSTRATION is an understatement. Not only have I gone without a player when I workout, I have had to sit on the phone and pay shipping back to Samsung.Again, GREAT player for MP3s only... BAD player if you are interested in playsforsure. If you have not heard or do not use playsforsure... this is the best EVER... basically netflix for music, but unlimited rentals!!!"
2,"Too Dry, Couldn't Get Through It","I've always admired C. Everett Koop, especially during his years as Surgeon General. Because of this, I was very interested in reading his memoir. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get through it. The book was dry and, frankly, boring. I respect the man, and what he has done for the health of Americans. I just couldn't enjoy the book.There are a lot of great medical memoirs, if you are looking for a good read about what it's like to become a doctor. For people interested in pediatrics, Dr. Meghan Weir'sBetween Expectations: Lessons from a Pediatric Residencyis a worthwhile read. It follows the young doctor during her pediatric residency and overseas experiences.God's Hotel: A Doctor, a Hospital, and a Pilgrimage to the Heart of Medicineis a new classic, about the last old-fashioned hospital in the U.S. It's a beautiful read."
1,poor quality control,"I have had various WiFi networking solutions in my home and office for several years. While some Linksys units have worked for me, more often I have found them undependable. In particular, the WPS54GU2 set up fine, but I almost always had to cycle the power to get it to work each time I printed. Not worth the hassle."
1,Look for compatibility. Where? Only Linksys knows,"I would recommend not to buy it, as it is not compatible with all the printers, you have to test it to see if it works with your printer. Linksys has a list of non compatible printers, but guess what... it is not available anywhere!!! If you want to lose your time and money, go for it."
3,Does not support multi function printers,The manual nor tech support seem to know this until you get to level II tech. That's when they informed me the server would not work with multi function printers.
1,This is a really small piece of junk,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I am VERY disappointed in Linksys. It is choosy about what printers is will use. It is PC-only! No network utilities for set-up.I bought it a while back and figured at first it was because my printer was old. Now I am seeing that the thing just doesn't work with anything.It is too late for me to send it back, but not too late for you to find a better product!Shame on you, Linksys!"
2,Good product but no security features,The product over all is good but came no use to me since it is not compatible to Linksys router WEP security. It works only if the router's wireless security is disabled.
1,Never worked.,"This printserver was touted on the box as being compatible with any printer (mine's only a single-function Brother), but it never worked with mine. I followed the directions exactly, but still nothing. So much for ease of use. I ended up buying a different printserver and everything worked great the first time."
3,"When it works, it works!","When I received the Linksys WPS54GU3 I spent too much time trying to make it work. I called Linksys customer support and tried everything they suggested. It still wouldn't work as a ""wireless"" print server. I mailed it back and got another one that worked properly using my wireless network to set it up. It works great now with two computers and two printers on my wireless network. Looks like Linksys shipped a lot of untested product and is struggling to correct the problems. If I had it to do over again I would go with another brand. These people don't deserve good customers."
4,It took a while but I got it working,"We bought a new Dell and realized that parallel ports are a thing of the past - like floppy drives. We still have our HP Laserjet 1100 which still works great and that is why I got this print server which also works wireless. It took a while to set it up and I had to call customer support. Customer support did help me solve the problem but he wasn't too friendly. Now that I have it set up, it works great. I upgraded my router & notebook adapter to Wireless G too and that helped a lot. The print server is behind the printer and I have no problems printing from another room in the house. I installed the print server driver for my laptops and had no problems - at least I did not have to call customer support. I gave it a 4 star especially for the parallel port and wireless features. Wish it would work for my all-in-one USB printers."
4,Works as advertised,"Found all the previous reviews helpful. Am using the server wired to my network (no wireless) with an HP LaserJet on parallel port, printing from 2 XP Prof computers on the network. The setup utility on CD-ROM failed to save at the end so had to switch to the web-based interface - learned this from previous failed Linksys product installs. Followed the instructions on the user guide on the CD-ROM to complete the setup via this interface and both computers are printing without a hitch. For reviewers complaining that their multifunction devices won't work - Linksys' web site for this product does say from the start that these devices aren't supported. Another note from Linksys manual is that they recommend that bidirectional printing be turned off for attached printers. This can be done (in XP) from Printers and Faxes, right-click your printer, select Properties, select the Ports tab, deselect bidirectional printing."
1,Very disappointing,"I have been attempting to configure pair of WPS54GU2s on a small hybrid (part wired, part wireless) ethernet network for about 4 weeks. I am attempting to configure the print servers wireless. The 'Quick installation guide' is useless, which, to be fair, is often the case with any device, but this time even the first activity doesn't work. None of the documentation, either on CD or on the site is any good and LinkSys support have not deigned to respond to my request for advice. Now I find out that these WPSs don't even support USB properly (if at all) anyway. I'm looking for an alternative. Avoid."
1,Piece of Junk,"My configuration:Dell Inspiron 8500Windows XP ProNetGear WGR614 Wireless RouterNetGear WG511 Wireless PC CardPrinter: HP PSC2210xi all-in-oneI had read the reviews here on Amazon and was a bit leery of buying one of these things, but I really needed a wireless printer setup without having to keep a dedicated print server computer on all the time. The concept sounded good so I decided to try it out and see if it really worked. Well, after following the instructions to the letter, I was quite disappointed. The printer would not print anything except for the diagnostic test message from the bi-admin software provided by Linksys. It's been a week with fiddling with the software, uninstalling/reinstalling drivers, updating firmware, etc. but the thing still doesn't work. The Linksys website has sparse information on troubleshooting too. Didn't bother with Linksys tech support since their reputation is pretty bad here. I am returning this product."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I have been on the phone, and on the internet with LINKSYS support suince I received this ite, The install discs did not work. The support personnel cannot help. After an HOUR on the phone, stumped, you are CUT OFF and have to start over. E-Mails to LINKSYS are ignored. I am NOT computer illeterate, but you have to have a systems degree to install this unit. Mine is still sitting here like a lump--I will return it to Amazon and ask for costs of shipping as THIS IS A USELESS PRODUCT."
1,Incompatible,"No incompatibility list from the vendor... it just never worked.It did not work with any of MY printers, multi-function or single-function, ink jet or laser jet per Linksys.They need a compatibility list. Worst Linksys product I have every attempted use."
1,not a strategic product,This product doesn't support WPA encryption! If you've managed to get your network past WEP don't get this product. Makes you wonder if Linksys has any strategic direction.
1,Won't work with a Mac,This equipment won't work with a Macintosh. Linksys Support told me that an agreement between Linksys' parent -- Cisco -- and Microsoft prohibited Linksys from supporting Mac computers. Whoa! I am still looking for the part of the product description which tells that Apple isn't supported. Didn't Microsoft learn their lesson? I guess not....
1,Linksys Failed,"As another reviewer noted, Linksys does not provide a list of compatible printers. I have both a Canon S750 and a HP PSC 1200 multifunction machine, and neither one works with this server. Nothing in the specs indicated I would have a problem with either machine.I'm an optimist in dealing with electronics. Effort usually pays off with success, at the cost of a lot of time. I will keep trying because I want this system to work. The HP has produced one test print page with the server hard wired to the LAN, but the printer disappeared when I switched over to the wireless state. Maybe there's a fix, but no one at Linksys is calling to provide one..... The techs are pleasant, but they just read the trouble-shooting guide you can find yourself on the web. The final step in the trouble shooter is, ""Try another printer."""
4,So far so good!,"After reading all the negative reviews, I was really hesitant on purchasing this device. I bought it locally at a premium just to assist with returning it if need be.It took about 30 minutes but it worked just as expected. I have a Canon i960 connected to the USB and HP LaserJet 6L on the Parallel port.The only problem I ran into was going from wired to ""wireless"". Keep an eye on the TX/RX from the print server (via the admin utility). If you don't see the values changing, there might be a configuration issue. Mine turned out to be the print server was not set to use ""Shared Key"" (I have WEP enabled). I believe it defaulted to ""Auto"". After making the change, all worked great!I'll keep you posted on any issues I come across."
2,Multifunction Printer Owners Beware!,"I suppose this product might be good for those of you who have non-multifunctional printers, i.e., printer/scanner/copier. However, I (like many of you) have a multifunction printer - a Lexmark X83 to be precise - and this print server is not compatible with this model of printer. This was verified by tech support at Linksys. The tech rep even told me that most multifunction machines are not compatible with this. Needless to say, I returned it. You have been forewarned."
2,Important Quick tips!,"I spent about 8 hours trying to get this device to work. It was all configured correctly and print jobs were going to the queue, but nothing was printing. I tried this on 2 different printers. Including the QMS 1250W and a Dell A960 printer.Frustrated, I eventually called Linksys support.The first thing the support agent told me was to hold down the ""Reset"" button for 3 - 5 seconds. It should print out the configuration details including the IP address. If this does not print, it indicate the device does not support your printer!!!How easy is that?Why does Linksys not include this very helpful and simple tip in the quick start???However, if you are trying to print a test page, you probably have already bought the device.I would strongly recommend avoiding frustration and call Linksys prior to buying the item. That way you will avoid having to return the item when you find out your device is not supported.Come on Linksys, you have let me down this time around!!"
3,"Like most Linksys products, the configuration is a pain","These steps are what I needed to use to get my Epson R300M to work:- Turn your firewall off when installing the print drivers- You will have to hardwire the print server to your router to make the initial configurations. After a successful installation, turn off your printer, unplug power from the print server, detach the network cable, wait 30 seconds and turn the print server back on. The WLAN light should now be on.- After successful print server installation, you might need to install the printer drivers as a local printer (as compared to a network printer). Select the Printer Server port as the location for the printer and load the drivers directly from the manufacturer's disk. At this point, I could print, and the Epson monitor was showing that printing was occurring.- You might need to set the print spooler to print directly to the printer (on the Advanced tab under printer properties).- Printer Processor should be Winprint/RAW"
1,This is a piece of junk,"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAPALL OF THE BAD REVIEWS ARE TRUE.THE DIRECTIONS ARE WORTHLESS AND THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS WORSE.IT WILL NOT WORK WITH THE NEWER MULTIFUNCTION PRINTERS.THE SET UP IS HORRIBLE.THIS IS A DISGRACE TO LINKSYS, PRODUCING A PRINT SERVER LIKE THIS.I HAVE MANY OTHER LINKSYS PRODUCTS, BUT NOT ONE OF THEM, DID I HAVE ANY OF THE PROBLEMS i HAD WITH THIS.BACK TO THE STORE WITH THIS WASTE OF PLASTIC AND PARTS.I HAVE NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED OR COME SO CLOSE TO JUST TAKING THIS PIECE OF CRAP OUT TO THE BACK YARD AND BLASTING THE LIVING SNOT OUT OF IT WITH A TWELVE GAUGE SHOT GUN.STAY CLEARSTAY CLEARSTAY CLEAR.DO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYdo you think I got my opinion accross?Too bad you cant give out 0 stars rating."
1,sucks,"this thing sucks, as does their telephone support. was told that it didn't support using 2 computers. it seems it should. am still on hold while i write this."
1,"I am sure it works, but not for me.","I've had relatively good luck with Linksys equipment in the past (we'll ignore the first three 4-port Linksys routers that bit the dust ofter working for only three months, but I digress). This Linksys print server, however, really disappointed me. My entire network is Linksys and I could never get the print server to do it's job.I have a multi-function HP printer, and I just saw some other reviews with my same issue. The least Linksys could have done was provide a list of supported (or unsupported) equipment so I didn't have to waste a weekend trying to get it to work.The only piece of networking equipment that has never gone bust on me has been my little 4-port hub that comes with me when I am travelling for work and visiting customers. Oh, wait... that's a Netgear hub I own."
2,Not stable,"I purchased this print server to be used with a Samsung laser printer (via USB). I do not need the wireless capabilities, but I opted for it for future expansion.I find that the print server is flakey in my setup. Half the time, the printer cannot be found on the network. To fix this, I have to unplug and replug the power cable. This seems to reset everything and I'll be able to print a few things before it happens again.Note that this is using the simplest of all possible network setups -- static IP address through ethernet, and I still have problems!I have been hoping that Linksys would fix the quirks and release a new firmware, but since it's been over a year, I suspect any future Linksys support is unlikely."
1,INCOMPATIBLE WITH MULTIFUNCTION PRINTERS,"This product is impossible to install with multifunction printers like the HP PSC series. I spent two hours on the phone with Linksys tech support. They were unable to get this print server working and finally concluded that their product didn't support multi-function printers. Note that Linksys did not indicate this limitation in their advertisement for the product, in their spec sheet or in their requirements.Don't waste your time with any Linksys product. Try another networking company and make sure that you ask BEFORE YOU BUY whether the product works with your printer."
2,Buyer beware- No WPA security,"How sad that after all the talk about the necessity of WPA security for a home wireless network, Linksys only shipped this print server with rudimentary WEP security. This is despite the fact that linksys's other wireless products DO support WPA security. As far as I know, users using WPA on their networks are out of luck as no other brands seem to be offering print servers with this feature. I spent 5 hours trying to configure this piece of hardware, only to find that it was uncompatible with my network. I will be returning it immediately."
1,"Great idea, terrible product","Linksys had the idea. A USB port, parallel port, AND wireless to boot. Just wish it would have worked. Their USB design is simply non-functional. Its broken and that fact was verified by their support staff through an email (after a wait of 2 days). I guess if you're lucky enough to have a printer that they support (there is no list, you just have to be lucky in the one you buy), then its a great product. Never even made it to checking out the wireless connection. I can't believe that Cisco/Linksys would let a product out that was this bad. I own several Linksys products and have purchased dozens of products at work but had to take this one back. I hope Linksys gets the word that their product stinks. Hope they get a version II out soon, and Linksys, if its not too much trouble, could you get it to work?"
1,Flaky,"I was able to get it working fairly quickly while physically connected to my network. But when I tried to get it running wirelessly things went down hill. Spent too many hours to count including a couple of them with tech support who was - to be fair - patient and competent. At the end of that call, the device was working properly. The conclusion was that my 128 bit wep key had to be a valid hexadecimal number including some letters?! After I got off the phone, I unplugged it and moved it to another location and was unable to get it working again. Various operations (like setting the encryption key ""incorrectly"") routinely crashed the wlan connection on the device forcing me to reset it. Waste of time."
3,Almost ready for prime time,"I have a mixed environment of Mac and Windows systems and want to consolidate all on an HP all-in-one 7100 series printer.From my Windows environment, it was not clear that I had to first install my print drivers before I could make a logical connection between my defined printer and a port created for the print server. This was a problem because the only way to accomplish this was to physically attach my printer to all my Windows systems, install the drivers then reconnect my printer to the print server. From there is was easy to connect my printer to the print server port and it has worked quite well since.The real down side is that Linksys advertises that this printer supports appletalk but the company provides no assistance in getting a Mac to communicate with the print server. So far, I have been unable to get my Mac to talk with the print server. According to Linksys, it is not supported and that is all they will say or do to help."
1,Doesn't work with USB port,"I have installed Linksys print server products in different areas and have been fairly pleased with them. But the latest 802.11G product line have been an administration nightmare. This print server will not communicate to Linksys newest wireless firewall/router across the wireless network. And when we try to leave it as a ""wired"" print server, it will not communicate across the USB port. It won't even work with the parallel port - the Canon setup software will not configure.All attempts to get this resolved with Linksys have been failures - they won't answer an email, and the telephone tech support has been useless. They keep referring me to other people who never call back.I am completely feedup with Linksys - which is a shame since I have been deploying their products for a number of years. But not anymore."
1,Dissappointing,"This server did not work with our system. We have a brand new Pavilion HP Laptop and a 3 yr old printer. After three separate phone calls to tech support and many failed tries to get the software to work, I just gave up."
1,doesn't work,this item does not work!!!!! Linksys support line has a waiting time for over 45 minutes. Amazon did nothing wrong. I am upset with Linksys.
1,Lacks compatibility,After two weeks of trying to get this unit to work with my HP 7750 printer - without much useful help from Linksys Technical Support - it turns out that the Linksys unit is not compatible with the printer! Why doesn't Linksys make it clear on their packaging or literature that their unit does not support many higher-end printers??
2,Linksys Wireless Print Server,"I am wasn't very impressed with this Linksys product WPS54GU2 print server.There are other Linksys products that I have tried and work fine. I bought this for a Dot Matrix printer that needed to be shared on the company's network. It wouldn't work. Trendnet's $40 print server did. I called tech support and they had no ideas. Since I bought this product and couldn't return it, so I replaced an older Linksys print server with this one.It is attached to a Samsung 1740 Laser Printer. I have mixed results. Sometimes print jobs don't print and I had to unplug the print server in order for it to work. All of the connections are hard wired with cable and I am not using the wireless. I couldn't find an option to turn off the wireless, which is bad security. This is my opinion on this product only and it doesn't reflect any dissatisfication on any other Linksys product."
1,Not as advertized,This print server can not be used with all-in-ones yet this is not pointed out in any documentation. Server is very limited in what printers it can be used with. Would not recommend for any general home or office use.
3,A few little tidbits...,"If your computers keep dropping the Linksys network every five minutes or so, go to the authentication tab and uncheck the Ieee authentication box. This seems to clear up the dropping issue. This tab is two levels deep, first go to wireless adapter properties, then to preferred network properties for the network you are using. You should then see an authentication tab.Configure the print server with a fixed IP; it does not seem to use DHCP well.After you configure the server wired to the LAN, you have to unplug the power cord AND the LAN cord for a minute or so to get it to forget the LAN and switch to wireless. Don't press reset. Just plug the power cable back in after a minute and it will come up using the fixed IP you gave it and be accessible to your wireless network. Perhaps not obvious: don't plug the LAN cable back in."
1,Impossible to Install,"The instruction that came with this are far from complete in getting you to a working print server. Even with three hours with technical support (call was dropped twice), they were unable to set this up. As soon as they hear of a netgear router they were all over that (even though the linksys box was unpingable and the router pinged and worked fine). The technical support personnel went down there list (I'm sure a hard copy list since they had no experience or knowledge of the equipment or even that a re-boot is not a instantaneous thing). I am returning this product, I honeslty believe the one I got was defective but even if it wasn't - I wouldn't want it in my network."
1,Junk,"Nothing works properly on this gadget. The wireless function is a joke, the USB connection simply does not work and the printers that are incompatible is huge, Linksys will not even release a list. Read the rest of the reviews below this one and know exactly what all those one star reviewers went through, as I did. Stay away, not ready for prime time AT ALL!!!"
1,May not work with your printer,"Turns out this product was not compatible with my 9-month old HP printer. Linksys support could not produce a list of compatible printers so no one knows if it will actually work with what you have. After asking their support point blank, he stated that it is ""too early to buy this product."" I've since returned the unit and I recommend that you wait until the next version of the firmware is available."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"Wanted to setup a wireless server for my HP5550 (parallel) and my DELL ALL-IN-ONE A960 (USB). Tried running SetupWizard.exe to install the software. Setup program crashed with ""SetupWizard MFC Application has encountered a problem"". Tech Support was poor (called twice got two different answers). The second Tech told me that the PrintServer does not work with multifunction printers (scan/fax) unless the printer manufacturer can provide a ""printer only"" driver. RETURNING!"
1,Doesn't work with HP G85 all-in-one printer,It doesn't work with HP G85 all-in-one printer. I was on the phone with linksys tech support for 1/2 hr trying various things. nothing worked. i returned it. tried again with a new one. same thing. this time i'll just get my money back.they had no compatiblity list. i asked.
1,Adjusting the Settings on this thing is impossible,"I'm a software architect. I design systems so I'm not emotional in this review. It's a fact. You have very few options on administering this device and if that fails, you can't use it. Resetting to factory defaults does not work. I would think Linksys would have fixed this by now. If you are not computer savy and understand IP communication, then stay away from this. This is not for the beginning and if your advanced, then be prepared to spend hours trying to trick it into doing what it's supposed to do out of the box. I'm about to go buy something else and throw this away because I spent a day on it and still can't get it to reset to factory defaults.Common fix this thing. You can make alot of money if you do."
3,Windows 7,For the most part the product works well. Unless you are trying to use Windows 7. Waiting on Linksys to make a good solution for Windows 7.
1,"Install Instructions do not work, once you get past that, it's fine","After many tries, the SetupWizard did find the router on the network. I never did succeed getting to the Next step.But I did recall my linksys wireless router is accessible via HTTP, so I tried the same with the PrintServer. Voila - no problem. http:// Username=admin, password=admin and complete the configuration."
1,This print server just does not work,I have an ordinary laser printer and this print server cannot print to that laser printer.Technical support is useless. It just kept asking me useless questions.Don't buy this product
1,"Beware of this printserver, hard to configure!","Server does not work with Compaq r3000t laptop with Broadcom 801.11g integrated wireless setup. After 4hrs. over two days with Linksys senior tech, it does not print from the Compaq. Linksys has no clue. Server is being returned to Best Buy."
1,Not for everybody,"Probably a great product if it is compatible with your printer, it wasn't with mine (HP6100). After 4 1/2 hrs on the phone with Linksys tech support, they said it must be a printer problem. Printer works fine if it is plugged directly to computer, go figure. I guess I'll try another brand or give up on the wireless thing for now!"
1,Apparently does not work with a multifunction printer,Would have been nice to know this before I wasted time and money on this piece of junk.
2,WEP Problems,It's a pain to set up if your network has encryption.It's a pain to set up printer drivers on the individual computers (but that's true for all print servers).Once its been set up it works very well.
2,Intermittent functionality,"Set up was easy but generally it was about 50% useful. Did not always connect, required reconnects and restarts. We finally gave up and just hrad-wired any laptop to the printer to use."
2,Never worked.,"I bought this product with great hopes for making my house wireless, but it never worked. After I made sure that I followed the directions properly, I called customer service and spent 2 hours on the phone trying to fix the problem. Eventually, they told me to mail it in for an exchange. That was 3 months ago. I called a month ago and they told me the product was on backorder and that they could not give me an estimate of when it would be available."
1,"Poor Instructions, Support, and Performance","For all the great reputation that Linksys has, this product is a non-starter when it comes to set-up and tech support. The scant instruction card details connection to a WIRED network without explaining that it must be initially done so before becoming wireless. And even then, there is no promise that it will be compatibale with a non-Linksys wireless router. After two or three hours trying to determine what I was doing wrong, I contacted Linksys tech support. Twenty-four hours later, their reply directed me to a weblink that had nothing to do with the product, let alone the problem. I returned the thing to Amazon."
2,Still not working..,My home wireless network and all of the components are linksys products and for the most part they work well.. I thought the WPS54GU2 Wireless-G Print Server would be an easy addition to my network setup. Well no such luck. The directions were clear but just did not work for my printer. I called the Linksys help desk and they helped me determine that my printer was not capatible with the server. Information tha would have determined my purchase.Bottom line make sure you have a capatible printer.
3,NO WPA ENCRYPTION - only WEP,"The unit worked well but was a bit difficult to get setup. I needed to call Linksys and they walked me through the setup. I have better than average networking knowledge but that didn't help me install this on my own. Once setup however, it worked very well but in the end, I decided to return it because of poor security. The print server does not support strong WPA encryption. It only supports weaker WEP encryption. Linksys said they do not have a time table to upgrade the firmware of this unit so I decided to return it. No sense in taking chances with your personal data."
2,Watch out USB users,"I have been Linksys fan for years. I have more than a dozen Linksys products in my house, from routers to access points to acess devices. Not only have the products been excellent and dead-easy to use, but the customer service has always been AMAZING! So given the option of paying $120 for a Dlink print servr or $170 for a Linksys, going with the Linksys was a no brainer.First and foremost -- this product does not work with my HP psc 2410 photosmart printer. Moreover, customer support says that linkss is having problems getting there print server working with any USB printer. It supposedly works fine using the parallel port, but many new printers (and almost all new HPs) lack a parallel port. Additionally, Linksys customer support stated that this is a hardware issue, and will likely not be fixable via firmware or driver upgrades. As a result, I'll be buying my first non-Linksys networking product. Caveat emptor."
1,Funny name for a product that doesn't work with USB,"Just spent many hours working on my brand new WPS54GU2 print server install. Installs, re-installs, firmware updates, software updates, Linksys phone support hanging up on me after being on hold for a long time...Conclusion: It just plain doesn't work. The really funny part is that I can get the ethernet communication working. I can get the parallel port working but, of all things I CAN'T GET THE USB PORT TO TALK! Didn't bother with the wireless connection. I have a wireless-G system but the box is no good to me without my USB (and parallel) printer working. Print servers kinda need that capability.I guess it's back to CompUSA for a refund. I double checked the name on the box just to make sure I didn't buy the wrong product. Sure enough, the name on the box is "" Wireless-G PrintServer for USB2.0""Funny name for a product that doesn't work with USB..."
1,Disappointment - Wireless Print Server and Cisco Support,"Well, after 3 tech support calls and many hard reboots and hard wired connections, this wireless pig does not get past the first install window. My last call with yazzi in india left me with a ""he'll call back"" after many attempts to communicate and fix the problem. Yazzi could not understand me and I certainly could not understand him.This pig is going back and fast. I just can't wait until I get to hassle with Amazon about the return authorization. This better work smoothly or this will be the last on line product I buy. I bet I will speak to an amazon person named Yuzzi."
1,Doesn't Work Well w/ HP or Dell Printers - Many Problems,"I have very bad experience w/ this product. It just doesn't deliver. I called customer service to get help but was left on the line for too long, just music over and over again. Save your bucks and wait for a better model. Installation instructions are unclear and complicate things. You Know, it just too early to buy this product."
1,Absolutely horrible! Don't buy!,You cannot configure it wirelessly.You cannot configure it with a Mac.It works only intermittently.Customer service is virtually nonexistent.This product was rushed out and is terrible.
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disapointed when I recieved this product. It not only cant connect to another router, unless its hardwired(connected by a wire) it can not do a test print. It was easy to set up. Most find they can do this without reading or the software, but this product needs to be set up with the software. There are two steps, the CD is run to set up the print server, then you have to install components to print to it. You cannot connect to the printer any other way, unless you have the drivers installed from the CD. There is no security. It states there is, but it does not work, and you will not be able to connect to it with it enabled. My recommonedataion is not to purchase it. I would return it, but the return policy of Amazon is a joke and I dont want to loose more money so I will keep it and get something better in a year or two."
1,Incompatible with my printer,"This is a real pain. I am not sure if this is made for home use or not. Probably just for offices where they have only single function"" printers. Most people I know have a printer with a Copier or a scanner or a fax (I have a Lexmark X5250). I should have read some of the comments here prior to purchasing this. I guess I will just have to return.Linksys support won't even listen to your case if you say that your printer does anything more than printing."
1,Not ready to be sold,"This server does not work with an old IBM 4019 nor a new HP Photosmart 7960. Their support was terrible, very hard to understand their broken english and did not seem to understand wireless networking issues. I returned it quickly..."
5,"The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization","Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet. Yes they really are that good.I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented. It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head. It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.I also highly recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones."
3,Fast-paced history !!,"Hired by Lee Oswald's mother, Mr. Lane did a job that pretend to demonstrate that there weren't enough proofs for the use of the Warren Comission to have declared Oswald guilty. In doing so, he writes a in a hurry, quoting numberless statements from witnesses. He doesn't tell who pulled the trigger or ordered to do so. He only tells that Oswald couldn't have acted alone, and focus on why the Warren Comission left out of the final report hundreds os testimonies who could have pointed to another conclusion."
4,View of an Australian reader,"Admittedly, it has been a long time since I last read ""Rush to Judgment"", but after all these years I consider it to be the benchmark of all the books and therefore writers who have dared to challenge the official findings of the JFK assassination. Ironically, this was the first book of any sort I read on the assassination and I found Mark Lane's style of writing so spellbinding that I was instantly cast into the role of an investigator myself. Many, many books, magazines, movies and videos later, I still come back to my very battered copy of ""Rush to Judgment"" whenever I want to get back to basics and put things in perspective. Lane's thorough investigation all those years ago has stood the test of time and while more in-depth analyses of certain aspects of the assassination have since come forth, this book still remains, to my mind, the best overall search for the truth. Thanks, Mark Lane, your book will always remain one of the masterpieces."
3,"Great graphics, but a short game","My three year old son really enjoyed this game, but from the point of view of the parent, I thought it was much too short. The original Reader Rabbit Preschool is much longer and more challenging. Sparkle Star Rescue begins at an easy level and gets only slightly more challenging as the child plays. It can be finished in a few hours of play time. The child earns reward gems for playing, but earns the most important ones first. Once all the important gems are earned, he or she is encouraged to fit them in their slots and finish the game. Any extra playing he or she would have done is cut short by this, though the child is free to start the game over from the beginning. Overall, I don't think this game was worth the money but my son enjoys it."
2,Big Step Down From Reader Rabbit Baby & Toddler,"This program has a lot of narrative preamble prior to the introduction of each simple (and very repetitive) game. If the object here is to teach children patience and listening skills, then maybe it's on target. However, in my opinion any child who is developed enough to have that kind of patience and listening skill is going to find the games completely unchallenging. So far I have been unsuccessful getting my boy to show the slightest interest in this CD."
2,"Glitzy, but frustrating for younger kids","The program requires a lot of fine motor skills. It's too frustrating for my 3 yr old. For example, there is a coloring page (""color all the squares blue""). There are so many of the squares, and they're so tiny, that even I get a little frustrated trying to maneuver the mouse onto each one. In addition, the product is set up around a theme of ""save the stars"". Kids at the younger end of the age range, such as my daughter, would probably benefit more from a program that lets them ""wander at will"" a little more. (Try Disney Preschool.) Or, at least, a theme that's a little more laid back. (For example, Pooh Preschool, where the goal is to help everyone finish their work so they can make it to a party.) I also highly recommend JumpStart Preschool.My daughter is at the young end of the recommended age group, so maybe she will grow into it more. For 3 yr olds, I recommend staying away from this one."
1,Beware Windows ME users!!!,"I purchased this game at Toys""R""Us and I installed it on my PC, it ran fine but when I went on-line the first time after the installation I could not get to any secure sites. I found out later that the program had crashed my browser, so I am posting this warning to any Windows ME users just to be aware of this problem."
2,too lengthy to keep a 4 year olds attention,"my 4 year old daughter was bored by this...all the adventures were too long to hold her attention. She'd start each segment with enthusiasm but it required doing the same thing over and over about 20 times to receive the ""brillite"" before you could go on to something else. It's just sitting on a shelf now...I'm sure there are better ones out there."
4,Silly.,Dolphina is silly but this is a fun workout. I really didn't think about using any of these moves in a burlesque routine until I did the workout. It gives my husband a good laugh to watch me dancing around to this video.
3,Meh,"It's not a bad DVD, if you're looking for something to get you out of your TV-hypnosis, but I wouldn't dare take this seriously as a workout. It's cutesy and has moments that work you pretty well, but overall it's just an ego boost."
2,Not worth it,"I just got this on DVD today and watched some of it. It is okay, but Dolphina is irritating! Her little attitude sermons make me want to rip every hair out of her head. She reminds me of some airheaded, rich, snot nosed brat at certain points in the DVD. I'll have to try to workout to this DVD and see if it's worth my time. Personally, I like The S Factor series with Sheila Kelley and Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip series much better. If you want a sensual moves and a workout that works, go with the S Factor. I've gotten the most developed core and thighs by using that workout and my flexibility has increased as well."
2,Not a cardio workout,"This DVD is very slow-moving and despite the word ""cardio"" in the title, you will not get any sort of cardio workout. You don't actually learn much of anything from this DVD either - I was pretty disappointed. I felt like an idiot doing some of the stuff too. The instructor isn't very good at cueing although she is at least pleasant. I also own the Carmen Electra Aerobic Striptease DVDs and those are much more fun and you actually get a halfway decent workout."
3,Hate the music in this DVD!,"I really love Dolphina for her sweet, fun, and energetic workout videos (I own a 4 disk set), but this one bugs me! I did it with a friend and the music is terrible! It is like a mix of the key-bored and accordion gone wrong lol. It was just to distracting for me. How can you dance sexy to music you don't enjoy? You can check it out on youtube if you want. See if it is for you or not. I gave 3 stars because her moves where fun and I love Dolphina, just the music choice was bad."
3,"Work it, cupcake!","Ok, this is not the most exciting workout in the world. If you're looking for intense cardio then you should choose another dvd. However, if you are looking for something fun to do in your days off between more intense workouts then give this dvd a shot. Like another reviewer said, the dvds pace is slow but it is a lot of fun and you will probably feel a bit silly at times (the boa segment could go, in my opinion)."
3,Not a work out,"I bought this dvd because I thought it would be a cool work out video. It was cool, but it is not a work out at all. It's more of an instructinal video, but only teaches some parts of burlesque- certain moves. Dolphina is funny and makes the video entertaining, BUT if you're looking for an exercise video, don't get this one!"
4,Know what you're buying,"I'm torn on this DVD. You have to know what you're getting your self into. It's good for a core workout, as it works your midsection and hips. I don't think it should be considered a cardio workout though. It is easy to follow, which is nice. This DVD could definitely be used by beginners (as I am one). I would use this in conjunction with your regular work out.The music. VERY slow and bland. Dolphia can be annoying with her pronunciations and performance. I gave it 4/5 for the fact that I would use this again. Just to work the core muscles and midsection."
1,The Goddess Workout,"The shipper is fine, got the DVD quickly. The DVD itself is boring. Instructor is very monotone and not much personality. Couldn't get 1/2 way before shutting it off."
5,The best recording in this repertoire!,"This is one of the greatest recordings of the century in this repertoire. From a liitle known Cuban pianist, it has all the flavor of even the greatest Chopin interpreters. I guess because this pianist is less known than most and available on what I consider a specialist label, it has not received much acclaim. However, you may rest assured that it competes most favorable with Cortot's and Askenazy's earlier (1933-34 and 1959-60 respectively) versions. A Chopin recording not to be missed. Enjoy!"
4,"In light of my revised rating of Zayas' Preludes,","I'm going ahead and upping my rating of her Etudes to 4 stars because they are better than her Preludes. I can't remember if it was Friedman or Hofmann who refused to record all the Etudes because he said that no one pianist could do all of them justice, but after listening to many pianists efforts, I'm inclined to agree with him."
3,Alright,"Here we go Disc my DiscDisc 1: Pete Tong... same old stuff played on the radio 24/7Disc 2: Fatboy Slim... impressed, didn't think Fatboy Slim could put together such a good mix, the best of the 3Disc 3: Paul Oakenfold... soso, halfway between disc 1 and 2"
3,"Well acted, but paced too slow.","This film had a great cast. I cannot complain about the acting. The problem is that the film crawls along at near snails-pace most of the time. Not much is explained about the main characters powers. Are they real or fake? I would guess fake, but it is not exposed in detail. The ""twist"" to the story was obvious to me from the time the ""murder"" took place. I was not surprised at the end.All in all a film worth seeing. But dont expect any action or edge-of-your-seat suspense. You wont find it here. All you get is great acting and a slow, yet interesting story. It's an average film in my opinion."
2,The Illusionist,Unfortunately this blu ray DVD comes up in a foreign language. You have to be certain to select English each time. Not the most convenient.
2,Proper Film,An acclaimed illusionist captures all of Vienna and also Crown Prince. When his fiance rekindles a childhood fascination with Eisenberg the Prince goes into obssession. An inspector investigates a shocking crime. Pretty boring period piece.
5,Brilliant acting; compelling story,"edward norton never fails to deliver and in this one he is equalled by the performance by paul giamatti. This has it all, suspense, drama, beautiful cinematography and romance."
5,Terrfic,"Edward Norton has never dissapointed me, but this is his best. Giamatti is also great. Good script, sets, costumes."
4,very good,"this movie is very good...it was a little hard to follow in places...the special effects were amazing and the story was great too...it lost points for me when the ending came around, though entertaining and a great 'oooooh' moment, it wasn't well explained, and for an ending like that not to be explained, it lost just an ounce of specialness...good but wierd"
2,This film could have been so much better...,"**Spoilers**I really wanted to like this movie but I found myself giggling at the 'love' story between Eisenheim (Norton) and Sophie (Biel). Edward Norton and Jessica Biel have no chemistry whatsoever due to Jessica's lack of talent, which in turn, makes Edward look hammy and over-doing it.And really, was no one expecting the end? Did anyone really believe Jessica's character was really dead? I also don't think writers really allowed the childhood friendship-crush pan out so the rest of the movie is rather forced and predictable. I have great respect for Edward Norton and would watch anything he's in but sometimes, even his accent was questionable. The romance is painfully, and sadly comical but the technical point in which the film was shot is beautiful. If not for Biel's ability to ruin every movie she's in, and if the plot was panned out more evenly, I think this film would have been better. But for the most, I was disappointed."
3,Good fantasy movie,"Was a little disappointed, but still a fairly good movie. Would classify this movie more of a romantic fantasy than drama. None of Eisenheim's illusions could possibly be performed by an illusionist from any era. All are achievable solely by using special effects. At the end, when Inspector Uhl works out all the steps that led to the final conclusion, we are still left with a lot of holes that need to be explained before we can accept all that happened. Eisenheim's plot would require that each character would have to react precisely in order for the final plan to succeed. While still an enjoyable film, it's recommended that you leave logic and common sense at the door and just enjoy the film for what it is."
3,Love is eternal and magic is real!,"The latitude used for ample CGI and special effects in this movie makes it more fantasy that historical, but it is a fun ride. The love story is naive and touching. A bit of a fairy tale with wicked princes' and damsels in distress. Though the accents were a bit forced the performances in this movie were strong. I loved Edward Norton's intensity; Jessica Biels' tantalizing beauty; and Paul Giamatti's candor while mimicking James Mason. One sex scene - implied nudity - no kids under 14."
4,To you,Thank you for buy that movie also cheap money than some shop cost up. but I don't like to wait for sent me mail but nothing to bother to me. I'm good.
3,I really enjoyed this movie. But.,"Edward Norton gives a great performance. If you like him, you will like this film. The storyline keeps getting lesser interesting as the movie goes on. The reason I give this film three stars is because I felt robbed of my time in the end. I mean, the end just didn't really do justice to the premise and a few things were left unexplained. The dialogues are decent. The sets and locations are fine. Some scenes in the first half were overwhelming while the sub-par end was the only major flaw I found in The Illusionist. The love story within the film was a tad dodgy cause there was no chemistry between the two involved. Paul Giamatti has done better films. His character had just one expression.Overall, I'd say, NOT BADHowever, I will recommend this film to everyone. It's quite ambitious."
4,Very Good!,"I really like this film. But it's irritating that the director made everyone, especially the Americans, over-pronounce their Ts. Americans over-aspirate when they try to do this. It sounds awful."
5,Trickery as a polished art,"I really enjoyed this movie, maybe more so because it seemed such an understated story, but still with a strong balanced cast, inspiring settings and exceptional cinematography. The Illusionist is a motion picture work of art, and the sense I got from the filmmaker and cast was that they were purposefully aware in the way the presentation was made.Even if the ending was in my sights before the story concluded, the way it was concluded was so tasteful and still with some surprise that it made me smile, just as the Inspector did."
5,A thoroughly enjoyable evening,I would classify this as one of the best suspense - romance movies I have ever watched. The cast and settings were excellant. The time frame made the movie more believeable. I didn't want it to end but the wrap up was great.
1,Waste of time...,"This movie was a sad retaliation to The Prestige. The acting was decent but the story was worthless. It jumped around constantly and pent up all of the secrets until right at the very end when they precede to dump all of the explanations on you in a matter of mere seconds. Not only are you left with a feeling of ""What just happened?"" but the explanations them selves are non-cohesive and make little to no sense. If you are in the mood for a good thriller, please, pass this one by."
1,I want those 90 minutes of my life back!!!,"I have always held Edward Norton for being an entertaining actor to watch. In reality, he has participated in a couple of good movies the rest have been forgetable. The Illusionist, however, is just BAD, a WASTE of MONEY. Jessica Biel, oh goodness, she is part of the new homogenized young Hollywood without depth, soul, sincerity, or conviction. She was barely good enough on TV and the big screen only highlights her shortcommings. Her accent? ridiculous. She is not a period actress, this would require actual skills which she does not possess. The story is bad as well.There is no character development. The editing is horrible. I felt completely disastisfied at the end of this film. Do not WASTE MONEY or TIME on this film."
2,Disappointed,"As well as I loved The Prestige as well I think The Illusionist is boring and predictable.The plot, if we can call that a plot, is that two young people love each other and want to end up together.There are few magic tricks at all... The Illusionist can bring forth holograms of people, but you hardly get an idea of how he is working to get that result. The film is playing on the principle: Does he have any special ability or is he an illusionist? But without having anything concrete about any of those.At the end of the film, the policeman gets a ""sight"", almost like in Usual Suspects, which explains to you in two minutes, how it was done.By this time, you would probably have guessed it and it is a wonder how the policeman gets all these hints from nowhere. Why and how he put all the things together at this precise moment is the only mystery of this movie.Two stars because of the special effects."
4,"Sexy, Sexy Mr. Norton","This was a great movie...I love Edward Norton. He is just the sexiest I have ever seen him in this movie, the hair !, the character's tenderness towards Sophie...be still my heart! The story is great too...love the ending! :-)"
2,The Usual Suspects in a Magic Show......,"I generally like Ed Nortons work and look forward to his new films. This one was kind of fun but quirky for atime. Not great, not terrible, run of the road movie...until the end. The ending was a clever reiteration of the ending of ""The Usual Suspects"", transparently so.Ed, you're no Keyser Soze."
3,"The Illusionist - It was a very long, slow setup","About the last 50 minutes or so was the best part of the movie. The beginning was very slow moving which frankly was tough to sit through. I would recommend this movie only if you are a diehard mystery fan and can't find another movie. Not bad for a rental, but I personally would not purchase it and I'm glad I didn't pay the theater price."
4,One of the interesting movie I've seen in a long time,"The movie was great. Edward Norton once again gave a great memorable performance. The plot is a love story set in 18th century Vienna. However it was very well written thus eliminating unnecessary fluffs that today's movies seem to have. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because, Jessica Biel wasn't right for this role (don't get me wrong she is beautiful just not suitable here), her acting was a bit cardbordish compare to Norton's. Also I didn't like the ending it was too dramatic that the movie lost its edge. Otherwise this movie is worth seeing."
5,Love triumphs over all obstacles,"Among the best movies I have seen, this shows the corruption in the final stages of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the insanity of a privileged aristocracy, the reality of inventiveness and character, while focusing on the love of a young duchess for a common carpenter-turned-wizard. The story line is compelling and inviting discussion, the characters are believable and brilliant, and the costumes and settings sterling. Neither staid nor ossified, this is one movie for all people, and can be watched repeatedly."
3,A smart and fun ride.,"The Illusionist has great acting and a good story.It tends to drag in a few places but it's definitely worth a rental.The magical tricks are fun and interesting to watch.The ending was kind of.......... Ho hum.Not nearly as good as The Prestige, but if your looking for a solid movie based on magic then this movie is a good place to start.Did I mention Ed Norton is one of the HOTTEST geeks on earth?And can somebody tell me where he got that long black coat?Still.......awesome movie!!!"
4,"Great film, terrible sound quality.","This film was superbly done, and had only one real flaw - you could not hear half of the dialogue.At first we (my filmgoing partner and I) thought this was a problem with the theater sound system, but we finally came to realize that the filmmaker did it deliberately.There seems to be an unfortunate trend these days, that when a filmmaker wants to create a dark atmosphere, or a mysterious atmosphere, he has the sound mixing folks crank the dialogue down to a barely heard whisper much of the time.It is truly infuriating."
5,Oscar worthy,"I get tired, REAL tired of customers who wanna be REAL MOVIE CRITICS, going in more depth than the mariana trench. This movie, if you are to see only ONE movie this year, should be it. A classic tale of young love, being torn apart, the finding it once again, with the help of some illusions along the way. The acting was superb, the costumes, hell, I felt like I was in europe 150 years ago! Rent this, then you will buy it, to watch it again."
5,Thought I Would Hate It But Ended Up Loving It.,I went into this movie thinking I was going to hate it but boy was I wrong. The illusionist is a love story mixed with mystery & fantasy leading to a very interesting movie. The story is unique and the acting is great. I am a huge fan of Ed Norton but I had low hopes for his performance in this movie. He typically plays the jailbird tough guy but in the Illusionist he is a sensitive and highly intelligent bad boy type character. The movie is dark but its not depressing or hard to follow. Give this movie a try and I can almost guarantee you will love it.
4,MOVIE OF THE WEEK,VERY GOOD FILM-KEEPS YOU GUESSING AND LOOKS GREAT ON BLU-RAY--THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS VERY GOOD AS WELL AS THE ACTING. EXPECT NOTHING LESS FROM ED NORTON
5,The Illusionist,Enjoyed it very much. The twists and spins throughout the movie kept us on the edge of our seats.
2,"If you haven't seen it, don't bother.","This movie started out with an interesting plotline. It sooned turned sour ... bad dialogue, slow pace, predictable ending.Don't waste your money buying this one ... it's a rental at best."
3,Smoke & Mirrors,"I bought this and ""The Prestige"" at the same time with the intent of a double feature. I have yet to find time to watch The Prestige, but, I suspect, it will be the better film. This Illusion in this film, is that is great. It has all the making of a great movie: the cast is stellar, the cinematography is impeccable, the story is a good one; but it manages just more than mediocrity.Don't buy this movie. Add it to your Netflix list or watch it when it hits the free section OnDemand, but don't own it. It isn't great."
3,Beautifully done movie,"I loved the premise of this movie. Great people behind as well as infront of the camera! I felt that Jessica Biel couldn't quiet hold her own against some of the acting greats here but that may come with time, I think she's only 22. And I did feel she was out of place being in the story they grew up together but she's obviously 10 years younger or more. Other than that almost completely seemless work! Great movie."
4,A delightful dalliance & denouement,"Steeped in mystery, this wonderfully light performance by all of the cast, results in a story that is well told, well acted, and well written. It gets more involving as it procedes and although there is tension, it never rises to more than uneasy anticipation and delightful resolution. This is an engaging ""date movie"" with a beautiful heroine, an unworthy noble suitor, a dashing talented lover, and an intense sense of affection despite adversity."
4,The Illusionist,"I gave this movie four stars... starts slow actually boring, but pay attention and don't lose focus. I bought it and played it through my oppo dvd player with the samsung 56 inch 1080 p model hoping for a pleasurable viewing experience... the sound track is good, but the movie its self is dark and because of the era it was supposed to represent doesn't display well. The only thing that makes this movie good is the ending about ten minutes of it... all of the things that doesn't make sense while watching the movie comes together in the ending... a love story, drama and illusions makes it a four star movie..."
4,the illusionist,"this movie was a bit slow but very interesting, with twists and turns. i enjoyed it."
5,Exceptional,"What an awesome movie. I can't believe that this movie wasn't more popular at the theaters. I'd love to tell you about it, but you just have to see it for yourself to believe me. I actually had to watch it again the next night just to catch all of the neat twists.Definately a keeper."
3,Everything you see is an illusion...,"This is a movie to watch on a rainy or snowy night. It's interesting and enjoyable but also a little to long. The illusion is really the whole second half of the movie. I didn't really get the thing with the ghosts, because of the previously mentioned illusion, ""why"". I will have to watch it again someday to see what I missed but I don't really want to watch it again soon, thus only 3 stars."
4,"""Everything you have seen here has been an illusion""","The Illusionist is a fascinating film directed by Neil Burger (Interview with the Assassin) and starring Edward Norton (Fight Club), Jessica Biehl (Stealth), Paul Giamatti (Sideways), and Rufus Sewell (Tristan + Isolde).Norton plays magician Eisenheim in 19th century Vienna. The Crown Prince Leopold, played by Sewell, is offended by Eisenheim because of his sudden appeal to the masses, and particularly to his wife to be Sophie, played by Biehl, who happens to be Eisenheim's childhood darling and current love interest. Leopold hires Police Cheif Uhl, played to perfection by Giamatti, to pursue Eisenheim and destroy his legacy.The film is filled with stunning visual effects, as well as many plot twists and surprises along the way.The best thing about the film, however, is the performance of the entire cast, particularly Norton and Giamatti who could easily recieve Oscar nods.RecommendedB+"
3,Powerful but Drowning.,"The film will probably be accepted as one of the better period pieces, yet it does not rise beyond that. It has a long drawn out plot, little action, and mostly just good photography and acting. This was good but it needed more to rise above the other period pieces; this is not a thriller or suspense, or even close."
2,"Good mystery, but I felt ripped off in the last 5 minutes!","The mystery in this movie was excellent at holding my attention. I was intrigued until the ending which was a let down and bordered on the cheesy. I think fans of M. Night Shamaylan's films would enjoy this flick, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend it. Great acting, though."
1,not happy,I was very disappointed to find that when i attempted to watch this DVD it skipped a half dozen times because the disc was so scratched. It's not even watchable.
2,The Illusionist,"Rather ordinary, a bit long and drawn out...found it did not hold my interest. Wouldn't rave about it to others at all."
2,Biel and Norton cannot save this,"Just stop what you are doingJust stop considering this movieGo watch The Prestige insteadIt is so much betterbut if you like Biel because she is hotthen by all means salivate awaythe same goes for Nortonalthough I do not know why he was in this film, it is below his acting standardsThen again he was talking to himself and Brad Pitt in the horrible movie Fight club. What a bar of soap that was. Yeah nothing to see here move along now people!"
3,Intriguing,"Edward Norton is an absolutely brilliant actor and he's also very nice on the eyes. To be honest, I didn't really like this movie, apart from Norton's acting. I just found that the movie dragged on and on. When the movie ended I had to shake my head because there was such a plot twist at the end and I didn't see it coming at all. That part was so well done. It's too bad that the rest of the film wasn't as interesting. It's not a perfect film but it is intriguing enough to have you watching the whole film."
2,Cheated,"Am i the only person here to have found the ending to this film a massive disappointment? I enjoyed the story and the acting was fine although not oscar worthy and Jessica Biel's lips have clearly been enhanced since i saw her last. Whilst intruiging and well shot this film tries for a big reveal at the end to surprise its audience and surprise it does. I won't reveal what exactly happens however i walked away quite angry. The reason for this is anyone whom has watched the events of the film closely will know that the ending is impossible and completely inane. I also find any film that reveals it's secrets in a short, rapidly cut flashback style montage very lazy filmmaking. Silent Hill also suffered this same problem. How so many people can rave about this being a true masterpiece astounds me. Can't anyone else notice the absurdity of it's twist? The real illusion here people is that so many can't."
2,D-U-L-L,"Slowly paced and monotonous, this film didn't hold my interest. The only positive things about it were the convincing period clothing, the cinematography, and the acting. Unfortunately, I couldn't have cared less about the story and the twist at the end came much too late for the movie to redeem itself. Finally, if anyone watching couldn't figure out what was going to happen in Eisenstein's last perforamance, then they weren't paying attention. Miss it."
3,"Interesting, but less than great","Interesting premise that never quite achieves its potential narratively or cinematically. And the special illusions that Norton's character performs onstage aren't really that interesting anyway.This film, like ""The Prestige"", never quite fires on all cylinders.Rufus Sewell is quite good in this, though. His character is far more interesting than those of the movie's two leads."
5,A Great Mystery Film,"I love the opening of this film. The first scene will hook you into watching the rest of the movie. It is so different from your common magician movie and it has a wonderful love story to boot.There is enough illusion to keep you trying to figure out how he does the tricks, but after awhile you don't even care how it's done as the story becomes more important.Get it and watch it! You will love it!"
4,Great Movie,"Great movie, although you have to pay attention to details, its really fun for those who want suspense."
4,PRETTY GOOD..I BOUGHT IT,"didnt know how the magic part would be, but it was pretty convincing, Ed did a great job..try ""painted Veil"" also"
3,Captivating yet predictable...,"If you are paying any attention to the movie, you can predict the ending pretty quickly. Aside from that, the cinematography, art direction, special effects and acting make this a glorious piece of work. So it is enjoyable, even if you already know the end."
4,wide screen dvd The Illusionist,"product received was the product listed, communicationfrom seller great. product arrived in a timely mannerThank you"
4,Get illusioned,"A great illusionist movie. Unlike its comparable movie The Prestige, this one has a different twist that you will enjoy. Having a Blu-ray version is a must."
5,the illusionist,This was a very captivating movie. It keeps your attention all the way thru. Then the ending provides the grandist illusion of all. I very much recamend this film.
5,Great film.,I am glad to have finally purchased this movie. It is a really interesting film and well worth the wait.
4,DONT READ ALL THE DETAILED REVIEWS!!!,"This is one of those movies where watching the trailer and reading all the detailed reviews will ruin it. There are twists and turns and true enjoyment to be found watching this film without knowing where it will take you.The acting is wonderful- Ed Norton as always is brilliant and Paul Giamatti almost steals the show. While it was somewhat hard to believe Jessica Biel in her role, she had an ok performance. This is a rare gem of a film, and is definitely worth much more hype than it received."
4,A very entertaining movie!,"This was a very good, very entertaining movie. With all the technology we have today we have no doubt lost the fascination with illusion that Eisenheim's audiences marveled over.My only criticism is that the ending was rushed a bit. Too much activity was placed in the last minutes of the film to allow for a complete and satisfactory explanation of the main element of the story, mainly, the mutual love of Eduard and the Countess."
3,Not a must see movie,"I was a bit disappointed with this movie. It is one of those movies, that had enough attraction to keep me in the seat and watch it, but afterwards I felt somewhat flat, as it didn't give anything deeper to ponder. Edward Norton from Fightclub played well, though his character in the movie was much of an enigma."
4,The Illusionist DVD,I liked this movie! Very convincing! If you like mystery and magic you'll like it too!
3,how did he do that?,"good movie, interesting with a good twist. Paul Giamatti does an excellent job! i recommend this one."
4,Really worth watching...............,"Eisenheim(Norton),an illusionist of magic practices his own brand of supernatural sorcery,enthralling the people of Vienna,including Crown Prince Leopold,who is equally enthralled and abhored.He embarks upon denouncing the great Eisenheim publicly but falls foul of his own plan by offering his fiance Sophie (Biel) to the magician in a bid to sabotage his act before an audience. This,however proves to be his undoing as Sophie and Eisenheim are not strangers to each other and they begin to rekindle a long lost romance.Chief Inspector Ull,(Giamatti) is drawn into the plot when the Prince,on hearing of their deception,orders him to charge Eisenheim with fraud.What follows is a tale of love and intrigue,tightly bound by the power of illusion.The illusionist is a well told story with clever use of imagery which consumes the viewer.The acting is of high quality with particularly strong performances from Norton and Giammati.This movie captures the imagination."
1,Why,"Why, Why, Why, Unbelievable. This is totally unnecessary. Do not buy this without listening to the samples."
1,Absolutely horrid!,"I can't believe this record has gotten even the tiniest smattering of praise from other reviewers. The vocals are HIDEOUS -- off-key and horribly histrionic and the band is just terrible. A friend played this album for me, and I literally thought it was a joke. But it's too awful to even be a parody."
2,Totally Confused,"Ever made a photocopy 100 times and noticed the distortion? Well, I haven't either but this recording seems as if it has been indeed proverbally ""copied"". I thought this was going to be a ""tribute"" album, meaning other artists singing Kate's material and incorporating their own style. I love KB but I'm trying to figure out the ""moral justification"" for this release. It is merely a good singer trying to ""hit"" Kate's notes lick for lick. Nothing new or worthwhile here; as the other reviewer said, just buy the Whole Story instead and hear the real thing.So in summary, I am confused as to why this was even made?"
2,What a bore,"Disappointing. What I look for in a tribute album are creative spins on the works of an accomplished artists. This is just a band trying to sound just like Kate Bush. You'd be better off buying ""The Whole Story"" and listen to the original artist perform her own works."
1,Sorry....it simply isn't Kate Bush,"Kate doesn't need any tributes. No one can ever match the power and beauty of the originals, and that is certainly the case here. Ill conceived."
1,AHHHHHHHHH!!!! HORRIBLE!,"I love kate bush, and when I saw ""tribute"" I was hoping for a bunch of artists doing their own takes on Kate songs. To me this album is HELL. It's just one woman trying to sound like Kate Bush and bring nothing original to the songs. Blah. I naver want to hear this album again."
3,A bit bland,"OK, but the music is a bit bland. Middle of the road arrangements, which don't have the bite or enthusiasm of folk music. Well performed, but no real excitement. Good enough for background music, but doesn't grip the attention."
1,What I thought of this book,"I read this book because it won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1983. It is, I believe, the least intersting and most esoteric book I have ever read. It reminded me of my reading of Fin-de-Siecle Vienna, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1981, and which I long wanted to read and then when I read it I found it a chore to read, and greatly welcomed the last page. The last chapter of Transformation made no sense for me at all, and reading this book's only significance is that I have read another Pulitzer Prize winner in history. I thought I should warn persons who might be overly influenced by the other 3 reviews and might think this would be a great book to read."
5,Isaac uses an anthropological view to describe colonial VA.,"Through a meticuless description of daily life in colonial Virginia, Isaac clearly illustrates the engines and motives that shaped present Virginia. Used as a tool the book is effective in explaining exactly what colonial Virginia was and how it assumed its present form. Read leisurely, the book is an engaging tale of the ends which produced America, including its psychological and political trends."
4,Helpful for Family History,"This book helped me understand some of the day to day events that affected the lives of people living in Virginia during this period. It explained the social order and how individual people, both slave and free were impacted. I was able to get a good understanding of how people compartmentalized their lives. They could go to church and pray, but on the other hand, they could mistreat people in so many ways. Meanwhile, they were also attempting to help build a country, a noble cause."
3,Transformation of Virginia,"I first encountered this book in graduate school, where it was assigned to our class. Many of us debated the merits of the book and concluded it really failed to deliver any type of lasting impression. Yet it won a Pulitzer Prize.All through the book I kept waiting for Virginia to ""transform"" as the title indicates it did. While Isaac presnts a lot of detailed information, it never really deliverd a convincing argument. ""Stillborn"" is one term that comes to mind. In comparison to Edmund S. Morgan's ""American Freedom American Slavery"" (or vise versa) Isaac book misses the mark. Morgan's work shows a definite transformation in how Virginia became a principal player in the establishment of slavery.Isaac's book is not a total waste, as it does cover a shorter period of time in greater detail than Morgan, but Morgan remains a master historian while Isaac has more work to do."
3,Low cal=low flavour,"I have to preface this review by saying that, after noticing my cat wouldn't touch these treats, despite having a tendancy to eat anything in reach (plants, fake plants, bits of newspaper, books), I tried one treat myself out of curiosity. I don't blame my cat for not wanting these treats. Low-cal=low taste, apparently.This could just be my cat's peculiar nature though. The treats look cute, are packaged in a resealable package to stop them going stale, and are low cal so perfect for Mr Porky. Hence me giving it 3 stars. If my cat actually ate them, I'd certainly buy them again."
5,Jesus in Georgia,"It took a New Testament scholar and Georgia peanut farmer named Clarence Jordan to make familiar Bible stories new and fresh. Joseph and Mary, from old-line Georgia families, travel from Valdosta to Gainesville, GA, where Mary gives birth and puts the baby to rest in an apple box. Paul and Barney travel to New Orleans and beyond telling the story of Jesus in all the White churches. These spatial and temporal transformations of the Gospel According to Luke (""Jesus' Doings"") and the Acts of the Apostles (""The Happenings"") rescue the Bible from the dustbin of history and re-instill it with the newness and excitement that the first hearers of these stories experienced. This volume, as well as Jordan's other ""versions"" of New Testament texts, provide a powerful new understanding of the roots of the Christian faith."
3,Stars Wars Role playing Handbook,"A little hard to understand, but it's a great classic to have if your a role playing nerd!"
3,Brief and concise history of The Beautiful Island,"Item received on time and in new condition. Very concise and somewhat poorly edited, but book is handy and accurate. Would buy again. B+."
3,Quick Overview,"This is a short book, no pictures. An OK overview of Sicilian history, but I found better perspective in other books."
4,Maybe my foot?,"I like the platform height, and the look. Gives me that added leg height I'm looking for with my jeans. Easier than most platforms to walk in, too. I have a problem with the buckle on the right foot chafing the top of my foot (this may be my foot though and not the shoe, in all fairness). I previously broke that foot right where the buckle hits. Making the strap looser solves the problem, so I am able to wear them. Such a bargain on price! True to size and width."
4,bbeachhead 2000 review,It did not work with my pc (Windows 7) and l had to return it for a refund. Would be glad to purchase again if you have a Windows 7 version.
4,"big bang , little buck","im in the military, and sometimes i dream of what it would be like to be on a beach head all alone, facing down a never ending enemy. all you can do is pull the trigger and hope you stall their siege. this game is worth 10 bucks, i would even buy it for 20. if you ever feel like taking on a whole army and its heavy support of apaches, tanks, fighter jets, b-52s, APCs, landing craft complete with a whole platoon, pick this up. TRUST ME you wont regret it........."
3,Entertaining but not substantial,This was a fun read but almost gauze thin. There's something to be said for that. At least there's no pretentiouness like Mankell. But one of Montalbano's assistant's dialog could have been delivered by Chico Marx.
2,Inspector is the wrong title.,"The problem with translation is that sometimes there are no adequate words. Montalbano is a Commissario. That is he is the chief of the Commissariat. Fazio, one of his policemen, holds the rank of inspector. Also, Montalbano is a gourmet, but he rarely overeats and knows seafood.Having read this in the original Italian-Sicilian, I can say that these are excellent novels to read. However, I do wish that Sartorelli would leave some of the Italian words in and translate them right beside the original. Camilleri does this in his original when he uses a Sicilian word that an Italian might not understand.Benjamin DeMaio Montalbano"
5,Sicilian JUstice,"Montalbano is one of my favorite policemen - very, very human in his many appetites, cantankerous and grouchy, but astute in his judgments and, of course, intuitive in crime-solving. This is his most thoughtful and provocative book yet. Descriptions of his meals make me want to board the next plane for Palermo! And three cheers for the excellent translation."
4,Delightful and Imaginative,"This is a highly readable book that weaves in and out between the human and animal world. It will appeal to animal lovers and those who relate to the idea of animals talking among themselves. Beatrix Potter, the main character, is a very strong and intelligent woman who gets to the heart of the matter to solve the crime. Her life, based partially on reality, and part fiction unfolds before us continuing on from the first novel, The Tale of Hilltop Farm. I recommend this book, it is delightful and takes you away to a far away farm and village with realistic characters."
5,DELIGHTFUL!,"You MUST read this series of 8 proposed books in order - this being the second. If you are tired, want a vacation and can't afford one - read these books. They will take you to a town of peaceful yesterday and give you a trip into TWO worlds - one of humans and one of animals who speak to each other concerning the events of the humans. If you love the drawings and life story of Beatrix Potter then you MUST own these books. If you treasure your personal library you MUST add this series to a special shelf - and to your mental enjoyment. They are a short read and a delightful trip that you will not want to end."
5,Love it!,I have fallen in love with this series written by Susan Wittig Albert. She not only tickles my funnybone but draws upon my sense of whimsy. What a great read!
5,Air Shocks,"Being only 17, i've never replaced shocks I just used basic common sense and a couple hours later my classic car was raised a couple of inches with these air shocks. I love them, one side of the car was sagging then I filled em up with 80 psi and it raised right up and they feel great. It came with everything in the picture the only thing different was that instead of white they were black... not that it matters for me, they were still Monroes. 5/5* [="
2,Monroe ma-705 ?,The air-max shocks did what I wanted them to. That is the good part of it. The bad part is that one of them leaked. I removed them and found it to be leaking where the air stem attaches to the shock. I cleaned up the leak area and applied J-B weld. So far it is holding air. I also question whether they are Monroe shocks or knockoffs. If it continues to hold air over the long run then it was easier to repair it than send them back.
3,Visually appealing but has a hard learning curve,"The game is visually very appealing, one of the best among playstation 2 games; but it has a very steep learning curve. You need to have a lot of patience to learn how to play it. It is not something you can pick up and get to it right away. The Chinese names of all the characters probably didn't help either."
2,Kessen 2,I am currently living in Japan and I have to admit that I was very disappointed by this game. It was really not very different than the first except for the ability to use magic and this time it takes place in China. If you enjoy a long lasting game than this is not the one for you but if you enjoy eye candy and not much else than please proceed. I finished the first game in about 1 day and this time I finshed it in about the same time. I found this game to be a waste of time and money. My advice save your money and buy the new Dynasty Warriors 3. It is ten times better.
3,"Good graphic, Too Simple","The graphics are good. The story line is interesting, although it gets bit cheezy.If you micro manage this game, you mostly like to lose. But if you place the army in certain positon and use specials at the beginning of the battle, you'll win.You can control the general but it's not that fun. There is only two mode of attcking. Rush or just simple swing. There is something called dual but you cannot control it. You can ask for it or decline it only.After a while, you just setup and watch. 60% of game time is spent on watching the story and army being moved. Almost feels like I bought a DVD movie not a game..."
1,BORING!!!!!!,"I have never heard of this game, my boyfriend convinced me in buying it. It looked like a fun game and i found it at a game store for $3, so why not. Biggest mistake i ever made i am glad i only spent $3 on it. It was so dull and boring. You practically do nothing. i wanted to give it 0 stars but it wouldn't let me. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! even if it's really cheap don't buy it."
4,Incredibly fun,Unlike the first Kessen it's not realistic like the first one but it's much better because you shoot thousands of rocks onto troops or shoot massive lightning bolts at them. Also unlike the first you are inside the battle with all your troops which is amazing because theres up to 500 soldiers fighting at once in a battle.Battle isn't the only thing you do in this game. You strategize which commanders you use and what route they take. Also you can decide ways to improve your army like making your troops farm for more provisions or devolope new weapons.Although not educational like the first one it took a good turn in the right direction.
5,STEP UP FROM FIRST.,"START PLAY ON BEGING LEVEL AS LIU-BEI-WHO IS FIGHTING,TOO RESCUE HIS LOVE.THIS GAME ALLOWS YOU TOO MAKE CHOICE THAT WILL DECIDE ARMIES MAN POWER,MORAL ,COURSE OF ACTION DURING COMBAT.ONCE YOU BEAT THE GAME YOU SWITCH SIDES,AND FIGHT FOR CAO-CAO,AND FOR CONTROLL OFTHE WORLD.I GIVE THIS GAME 4.5 STARS.ITS NICE ANIMATION,GRAPHICS ECT.THE USE OF MAGIC,AND OTHER ABILTIES MAKE IT A STEP UP FROM THE ORGINAL(i'd give that one a 4),BOTH FUN REPLAY VALUE.THE DUEL SEQUENCE ARE AMONG THE THE MOST INTERESTING(trick too duels make sure your armies zeal bar is higher then the computers or you'll loss).I WON WITH ONLY ONE CONTINUE ON CAO-CAO HARDEST LEVEL.THIS GAME ALLOWS YOU TOO BE A BIT LAZY -IT WILL PLAY IT SELF JUST FINE.THAT IS THE DRAW BACK."
1,"Grobust, waste of money, doesn't work!","Bought it to try it out for the first month. The pills were big, they stink, I hate the fact that you had to take it three times a day without caffeine to be effective. For the first two weeks, it made my breast fuller. By the end of the month, I saw no changes. by the end of the second month, still no changes and when I stop taking it, it sagged my breast. If I knew from the beginning that this was going to be the end result, i would never bought it to try it out. Grobust, it doesn't work and will sag you breast."
5,Great Product,"This product arrived right on time. I would recommend this product to females who need the extra boost to your libido.....it works!! I am not joking...whenever I took the tablets, I find that I am more stimulated and ready to go with my husband. Great product!!!!!"
1,Sucked!,This product is USELESS! DO NOT buy it! the pills are huge and they stink. they allso do NOTHING. i took the larg bottle AND the smaller bottle shown in the picture and nothin happend! not to metnion they are expensive.who know what the hell are in those pills and what i was putting in my body!
1,Interesting yet fustrating read,"This book is interesting because of Fleur's first person POV narration. We did get a brief glimpse of Anthony's feelings in the first few pages of the book but after those few pages we are robbed of how he feels...only Fleur provides interpretation of his actions and words. To me that was the first disappointment.The second disappointment is that Anthony and Fleur's ""love"" (and I use it very loosely) is based on Anthony's fascination and obsession with the image of Fleur while she was married to her first husband. He claims that he fell in love with her on sight. The love is empty, the ""body"" of the story is weak because there is no rhyme or reason for the development of Anthony's love from obsession to hatred to ""love"".I feel that this book and premise had a lot of promise. The writing was beautiful but overall the love story fell flat."
1,Stockholm Syndrome,I've never hated a fictional character so much as Lord Anthony. His treatment of Fleur was stomach-turning. This is no romance novel; try Stockholm Syndrome to describe this repellent piece.
3,"Good Game, when it works","I have installed it on Windows XP, and I've had problems with the video going crazy once in a while, like the colors all flip to their opposites. When it does work, my nephew, who is almost 3, loves to sit on my lap and we play. This coming from a little boy who'd rather run than walk any day. He is having fun and learning at the same time."
5,VERY ENGAGING for toddler!,"I love this CD. My 20 month old has a very short attention span in general. But this keeps him very engaged. There is the option to use either a mouse or keyboard, which he'll switch back and forth. This is a lot of fun and there are several types of learning games. Sometimes we play it together or I just let him sit and play the games himself. I can't believe I can just walk away and the software will know when to move on to the next scene automatically. This is absolutely incredible."
4,Enjoyable for 16-month old,"Our 16-month old enjoys watching the animation, listening to the songs, and is working on learning how to control it. Still needs some help, but he asks for playtime using the computer now. Plenty of activities."
4,be careful! not for apple leopard os,while I am very familiar w/Reader Rabbit- an excellent first video this product was not able to play on our Apple Leopard OS- the pkging says compatible with MacIntosh but it could not be downloaded- a more explicit description would have saved me this problem- very disappointed
4,This one Is the best for young toddlers,"I have purchased several titles for my 17 month old, and I always come away wishing I could write my own software just for him. He's very bright and already knows his alphabet, shapes, colors and numbers so when I purchased software I was specifically looking for something that would teach him to use the mouse. This is the best tool for that. We got him a track ball and he's able to operate this program more or less independently, although he occasionally gets stuck and says, ""Sumpin' new!"" We recently purchase Mickey Mouse Toddler and it's not nearly as good by comparison. He's got reasonably good mouse control, but we still have to give him the keyboard for Mickey."
2,Read the fine line...,Don't trust the fine line. It Did not run on my Windows Vista nor Windows XP. It freezes. in the middle of the installation.
5,Excellent for toddlers,"I bought this software for my 18 month old daughter... It took her a little while to figure out the mouse, but she was never bored while she learned. She is now just over 2 and has mastered all the games on both the Baby and Toddler segments.. She still loves Mattie and Reader Rabbit. I also bought 2 of the baby and toddler Sesame Street tiles... They are not as easy to learn since they require the child to use either the mouse OR the keybord, no game uses both, and these games bore her. I highly recommend this Reader Rabbit title for your child age 1 - 3. I'm off to order the preschool title! I'll let you know what we think!"
5,A program that grows with your kids!,I like this program because it is easy for small ones to use. I have a 20 month old and a 4.5 year old. They both love this game.
5,Great first software program,"I worked in a children's library and I saw so many children learn how to use a mouse from using this program. Two year olds grasped the concept of ""when I move the mouse, I can make this happen"" so quickly with the fun, fun, fun interactive games for toddlers. I now have a 2 year old of my own who has been able to play some of the games here for close to a year now. I have to agree with the amazon.com reviewer on everything but the fact that I think Rainbow Rock is the best part of the program. It is the best way for kids to learn, not their colors, but how to work the mouse as they move the ""crayon"" over the picture, coloring it in. When the picture is finished, a (mostly) catchy tune is played. My daughter loves this and so did every 2, 3, 4, and even 5 year old in the library who would use it. I highly recommned purchasing this software program for anyone with toddlers."
3,Software difficult to install.,It would not run in MS Windows2000.It would not run in Microsoft XP.It would not run in Mac OS9.There is a bare minimum of online support.It RUNS in MS Windows 98 and fairly well at that on my old laptop. Just thought you'all might want to know.ps-my son likes it when it runs.
5,WONDEFUL,"I bought Playtime for baby & toddler at a local store, while waiting for another reader rabbit cd to come in the mail and my daughter is actually 4 but absolutely loves this cd. Even though it is a toddler cd don't let that fool you my 9 year old plays it, don't tell him I said so though, LOL. I have 3 kids and we know have bought the reader rabbit thinking adventures, preschool and cluefinders 4th grade. My daughter loved the part where baby animals are in a basket hiding and they make a sound and you have to reunite them with their momma. She also loves peek a boo bubbles where she pops bubbles to free animals and then it counts them back to her after she has freed them all. It is very simple to use and they dont even have to click a mouse button, they can even just hit keyboard buttons, it is very simple and all my kids were delighted with these products and my husband is a computer tech and we have reviewed many children cds and Highly recommend reader rabbit software."
4,Well received at appropriate age,"Reader Rabbit for Baby has been a favorite gift that we give to my son's friends as they turn 1 year old. It seems that the girls take a liking to the animation before my son did. He is 1.5 years now and is just starting to really enjoy watching the screen and hitting (literally) the keys. Recently he has started reaching for the mouse, but it will be awhile before the coordination is there.Overall, I'm glad that there is a software available for those under 3 years of age which creates awareness and helps with interaction."
4,Wonderful movie,This movie shows the beauty of the most southern part of Louisiana. It all tells the tall tell story of love and jealousy. Provactive
4,Good movie!,"The story line is good and the acting is very well done. Filmed mostly in Louisiana, it depicts some of the people around here. Not all! I am from south Louisiana and found the movie enjoyable just as long as non-Louisiana people don't really believe that we all talk like this. But a good movie nonetheless. My husband even worked security on the film locations when they were down here!"
1,Extremely Negative Experience!,"They advertised a DVD, I ordered a DVD, they sent a Blu-ray that I couldn't play. When confronted with the mistake the company made more excuses then you could imagine and then lied! I don't do business with companies like that! I sent it back after many emails trying to get my money back."
3,Not Just For Cajuns,"I only gave it 3 stars because so much of it was predictable. The ending was a welcome surprise that more than made up for it though. Jonathan Shcech is more than exercising his acting chops. Seems he has decided to become a character actor instead of a ""pretty face"" who can act. Job well done. The relationship between Schech's character Bo and his brother Peboan was touching and done very well. One of the things I love about low budget ""regional"" films like this is they tend to concentrate on the characters more than the action, murders and sometimes even the story. Several characters were sympathetic, like Bo's best friend and the hooker , who fell for Peboan. Some of the stroy is a redo, but it was done very well. But the ending made up for any deficiencies. I really give it a 3.5 stars. Worth the money."
1,Waste of $20+!! Save your money!,"This movie was referred to me by a friend! I decided she probably doesn't like me much because this move after shipping & all was over $20. My husband, who is from Louisana, & I watched it together. Little Chenier was boring, uneventful & a waste of money!! Don't buy it!!"
2,At Least Tamara Braun Was In It,"I have to say that after watching the trailer for this movie I had pretty high hopes that it was going to be a really good movie. I have to say I was quite wrong. Other then a couple strong performances, the acting felt very loose and the story was a bit all over the place. I have to say if it wasn't for Tamara Braun, it would have gotten 1 star for a review."
1,Don't waste your time,"Having just seen this movie, I can only agree that the music is great and the scenery is fantastic! I love seeing anything shot in Louisiana. The story and the acting are what brought this movie way down... It's kind of like growing up and being told that two wrongs don't make a right. Accent is everything and too many times I thought to myself wow, that doesn't sound right. Having read other reviews, I realize this may go against the grain, but I can't ever reccomend this movie to a friend if I would want them to see southern Louisiana or a great movie."
2,Who proofread this book before it went to print?,"This book sounded interesting, but unfortunately, the abstract story went right over the head of my 5-year old nephew, and the ""pictures"" (stylized black & white photographs of objects not obviously related to the story line) were confusing to him.The worst thing was when we got to the last page of this very short book, there, in large black print, was a glaring typographical error. (The word ""strangest"" was spelled ""stangest."") My guess is that all of the copies from this print run have the same error.... gave this book 2 stars because despite its flaws, it has a unique style that may appeal to someone out there. So give the book a try, if you like, but I personally would recommend trying a different book. There are so many other great books to choose... and most of them have all the words spelled correctly!"
1,Not a Real Backpack,I did not realize that this was a toy and not a real backpack. I was searching for a real usable backpack and this is what was presented. What a disappointment when it arrived. It was never used for school because it was a toy and not real.
3,Quality of the book is..,"contents are good and i like it.this book will make your English skills advancedbut also make you consider of our current important issues.(especially, for students who are studying English as a Second language)it can help us access to a lot of issues that has raised thesedays.if you wanna get to know about these issues deeply,i reccommend you to discuss with others. (friends or family..)and.. I thought it was just only book, not included CD.Yeah... it was my fault, so even though I didn't need it, paid almost $9 for CD.Anyway, plz make sure before you order."
5,good product,"This product is really good, I like it. This book is a book, not paperback, this make a surprise for me."
3,Kids love it but watch out...read on...,"This car arrived and literally took 5 minutes to put together as most of it is assembled. The quality of components are great and it appears robust.What had me stumped was that the steering worked back to front and you needed arms like a gorilla to steer the thing. I thought this was a model and not a toy. Initially I was disappointed but under closer inspection it appears someone at the factory had assembled the steering the wrong way. I removed 2 split pins, relocated the steering arm and then fixed the arm back in with two paperclips. Works fantastically now and the kids won't get out of it."
4,The only one I have.,"Though the whole album is pretty good, ""The only one I know"" is definitely the high point. Most of the disc has a good groove to it, and has alot of organ throughout. Some tracks dancy, some trippy. It simultaneously sounds retro and modern, and is good thing just to put on and enjoy. They also have a ""best of"" called ""Melting pot"", you may want to try that out. Either disc should fit well between your ""Happy Mondays"" and ""Stone Roses"" cd's."
5,Best Charlatans album ever,"This album never gets old, even 18 years later. This is the true Manchester sound for that time period."
4,gOOD START..BUT CHECK OUT LATER RECORDINGS,"I Am surprised that AMAZON only has two of the albums available. This band definately matured as they released the next four albums. This was a great debut album. They didnt do all that well in the states, but most halfway decent English bands dont fit the mainstream pap that is the US / MTV top 40. If you can, get a lyric sheet, its worth it. oh yeah and as I mentioned source out the other albums that followed, you won't be dissapointed."
3,Needs a better description,"These kitchen towels are okay but I would not have ordered them if they had been properly described. Yes, they are 100% cotton but they are cotton terry and were not described as such. They are a good size but the stitching started to unravel after the first wash (casual/perm press cycle). I am disappointed and would not order these particular towels again. I have other John Ritzenthaler towels that I have used for over 10 years and they have held up exceptionally well. I do not expect the same durability from these!"
4,an example to follow,"this is a good exampleof how to make an atmospheric movie without special effects or gory scenes.Do not care about bad reviews.This is a good movie which is not supposed to scare but to intrigue the viewer.So I recommend it and...pay attention since the first minutes and enjoy the final scnes, shocking and unexpected!"
4,"REAL GOOD, DIDN'T EXPECTED!!!","This was a very well made movie with quality acting by all. The description of the movie does not tell the whole story. There is much more to the story line that is very interesting. There's a lot of tension and a few bloody scenes, mainly dead sheep. Dorothy is a ""gifted"" young girl who many believe is under demonic control. A doctor comes to comes to her home after a disturbing incident Dorothy has while babysitting. The doctor believes Dorothy has multiple personalities. This is when the story really takes shape and draws you in. What is really Dorothy's gift??? You will have to watch the movie to find out. Very entertaning story and well worth a watch."
3,Dorothy Mills,"Dorothy Mills has a lot going for it. Its well acted, has a nice plot with a bit of originality to it (pretty rare nowadays), well written, well shot, the recipe for a stellar movie. Unfortunately I also found it to be quite dull. The movie is very somber, and meant to be as such, but it was just so grey, it kind of made me tune out at times. Nothing more I can say about it really, it has a multitude of good points, but just came off a little slow. Still recommended though."
4,"an Interesting approach,","While ""Dorothy Mills"" didn't blow my socks off, it definitely held my attention. The acting was well done, and the unfolding of the plot, though somewhat predictably, was fun to watch. This film is a welcome addition to my movie library,"
2,BAD,I thought that the book would have the full beginning of Bat Out Of Hell but it is shortened straight down to the start of the song. It's not an accompniament u play the actual song and it is the same through the whole book.It's very very poor!
2,Blah..........,"After forcing myself through just one listening, I find nothingmemorable worth noting here. No tunes stuck in the head, pleasant emotions, thought provocation or the like. I see that this is areissue of their first recording, so maybe they've gotten better.I would have to think so if Saddle Creek and Bright Eyes got involved with them. I'll try to explore some more of their stuff,but this offering doesn't give me much incentive."
3,interesting,"No one can question the academic credentials of Everett Ferguson. He gives a fair treatment of the biblical, historical, and theological evidence for unaccompanied singing in public worship. However, I did not find his evidence compelling enough to accept all of his conclusions. None the less, it is a profitable read and makes a wonderful contribution to our understanding of the practices of the early churches."
2,Works Good 'Til It Breaks,"This splitter works pretty well for the occasional woodburner. It will not suffice for the fulltime user. If you try to split something that is simply too much for it, it might break - like mine did. The carrier weldment that holds the log (at the bottom) cracked out from too much pressure. When I tried to order a replacement from Mantis, they said they don't have any and would not ship me the needed part."
2,OK Splitter,"I bought mine from a local Lawn & Garden. I have been able to split maple and beech with no difficulty.My biggest complaint is the vertical lift. Many times the log falls off on the way up to the cutter. Also, one has to have both thumbs occupied on the handle to operate it. I have needed to get my foot on the log to keep it from working its way off.I had it on Craigs List last year with no luck. I want to get a horizontal one as soon as possible."
5,This Set Will Be Released In The U.S. Soon,Save some money and buy this 2-CD set when it comes out in the U.S. in February!
5,The Best of Fela Kuti,"A must have no doubt if you're into world music like the novice that I am. This album, will no doubt open your mind and your ears to the music that is so hard to find. It certainly brings out the passion and in discussing with a friend, the anger and the apathy in that region of the world no less. A must have...you won't be sorry, I promise."
3,Whoah... wait a minute here folks!,"I suppose everyone will hate me for saying this, but this album should NOT be compared to Marley or James Brown. This is quite standard Afro-pop stuff! I bought it after reading the reviews here and was hoping for a little of the joy that I've gotten after discovering truly incredible African artists. I'm sure there is a lot of history here & Fela Kuti may be a pivotal figure in African music, but to my ears it is a long long way from having the importance MUSICALLY of Marley or Brown. Politically, if you know African politics, maybe it has incredible sentiment. Just be a little cautious in listening to the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. For those of you who love it... great! To my ears he's closer to Kenny G than the truly funky highlife & guitar rhumba bands."
4,a matter of taste,"The problem with all 'best of' compilations is that everyone's taste differs- I'm no expert on Fela Kuti, but from the 4 or 5 albums that I have I noted several songs that are better than the ones included on this record. However, as an introduction to Fela, you can't go far wrong with this- songs such as Lady, Water (he no get enemy), Zombie, and my personal favourite (though no doubt many will disagree with me) Gentleman are simply sublime examples of this type of music- the songs generally start with a simple riff, for example on a saxophone, and are driven along by a pumping bass. After building you up to a state of high excitement, Fela's (usually witty/cutting) vocals come in, delivered in his magnificent bass tones. Absolutely fantastic. However, as mentioned above, if you've got the time and the money, don't get this album- get the individual albums, which all seem to be coming out in remastered form."
4,A pretty good CD to start a Fela Collection,"Having collected most of Fela's recordings, I think this is an excellent set for starting a collection. Fela is one of the most important musicians and activists of the 20th century, and I am lucky to have lived and studied in Nigeria when Fela was at the height of him musical and social power, and witnessed how his strange, empowering and confusing energy coursed through the veins of an entire country and region like a potent drug. That essence remains in his music that has not lost any of its power, not even those pieces that are over 30 years old."
5,great deal,This is great item for price. Delivery was quick and instalation was painless. If you are looking for this type of item I strongly recommend.
2,"Pretty, but flimsy","This glass looks pretty, but the upper edges are extremely thin and prone to easily crack. I ordered a set of 4 and they ALL came broken. Upon re-shipment with better packaging, the glasses were intact. Still, they are thin and may easily crack."
2,Great art; bad text,"Not particuarly good. I'd recommend Celtic Warriors (by Time Newark) or nearly any book by Peter Berresford Ellis, if you can get ahold of them. The saving grace, however, is in the artwork. Angus McBride is certainly talented, and people should check out his other works.As for the text, there is not much too it. The classifications of helmets was good, but the history seems to come entirely from pro-Roman sources, such as Caeser. It therefore contains a large number of mistakes about Celtic civilization, mostly ones that reinforce the stereotype of ""noble savages""."
4,MDS,"This is an excellent treatment of MDS for the practitioner and the acedemic. The authors do an excellent job covering the history behind MDS, the theory, its interpretation and its use on various computer software packages. This is a modern textbook in an obscure area of statistics/research, and is very informative. The mathematics in the book are relatively simple to follow -- it even allows the reader to comppute a multidimensional scaling on a simple scale. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about MDS, or anyone who is looking for a unique analysis of data."
4,Dainty and cute,"The reason I bought this bracelet was because of what each gem represented. You may or may not believe in the seemingly hokey beliefs of gemstones BUT I do. I don't treat this bracelet as a good luck charm but as an affirmation to myself, to keep my mind focused on what is important, and to focus on the big picture.So far this bracelet is doing its job by looking cute and reminding me to keep calm. I recall another reviewer saying this bracelet is made for those with slender wrists and I agree. I do like this bracelet and I think it would make a wonderful gift to a friend who may or may not need a reassuring affirmation in her life."
5,All Levels,"As an artist learning something new I was looking for a basic book explaining all terms and projects showing the author to be truly talented. This is all you need for a complete first course.There is some disagreement among the various author/artists about the term "" float"". Other than that they all seem to agree about basic techniques. Beautiful demos and photos.Greatest thing: The author takes you through several projects which you can do on any paper or wood for practice, and then divides these into three levels so that you can achieve the degree of finesse you desire. So practical! Take it from there!"
5,Outstanding,"I really believe this is the ""bible"" of decorative painting and should be in anyone's library as reference - even those who may art journal, etc. Outstanding"
2,Review of Life on Sunnyside Farm by David Motherwell,"I found the book to be historically interesting and it started out well enough, but I thought the latter half of the book was disjointed and chapters appeared to be ""added on"". The book as a whole would have been better if events were put entirely in chronological order.Having lived in the Ozarks, I found the descriptions to be too generic and borrowed, and would have enjoyed more personal desciptions from the author. The descriptions were too superficial, so I never got the ""feel"" of the author's surroundings and experiences.I also questioned some of the factual content of statements made in the book. It's as if the writer did not do enough research on certain topics to have an educated opinion. In other words, the writer jumps to conclusions in his evaluation of people and events without adequate knowledge and background. It appears that he took shortcuts in his research."
5,I just love this book!,"My daughter and I just love this book! (She is age 3 1/2 - but I think the book would be good for kids of all ages.) The poems cover a wide range of subjects, for example giving ear drops to an elephant, or odd sayings that grownups use. The poems are often thought-provoking. The illustrations are dreamy Peter Max style pictures, with lots of vivid pinks and oranges and other colorful colors. I could read this book again and again. I wish it was still in print, so I could give a brand new copy to my niece!"
2,Really?,"I am giving this book two stars. One is for the one funny joke on the cat side. The other is for the One funny joke on the dog side. I really thought the cover on this book looked adorable and it would be worth reading so I could torture my kids with the dumb jokes. Most of the jokes wouldn't have even been funny if you were drunk. Really, save your money and find another title with a bit more to offer. This book is filled with dumb sentences. I'm not even going to refer to them as jokes because that might imply that they were actually funny. Even for kids this book is seriously lacking."
5,Love Buster from Amazon.com,"I ordered this book, paid an awesome price for it, and got it within 5 days. I had been wanting to get this book I had seen it before,I bought it so my boyfriend and I could work on our relationship and keep it strong. It is for married couples but we still used it so far it is doing good the ideas and concept of the book is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Great taco seasoning,"This is a very large bottle of taco seasoning sold for a low price. It also has an excellent flavor, which is not tainted by msg. It's not overpowering either. I'll buy more for sure when I need it."
5,WONDERFUL!,"This is the BEST taco seasoning! Tried McCormick's ""fancy"" taco seasoning, YUCK (to many crunchies). This one is perfect with a wonderful taste, dissolves well. Very happy! We use this in eggs, chili, tacos, dips, grits, and so forth. LOVE IT!"
1,Doesn't work with Windows 7,"This software is not compatible with Windows 7- it installs, but will not run. Supposedly works with Windows XP, but definitely not with Win 7."
4,Cool,item arrived in a timely manner. Thank you for your prompt service. I will shop from your store again. ...
1,Frustration,"This product doesn't work with new computadors. It requires old software. I have access to 2 Mac, 1 Acer and 3 Hp computers and I couldn't open 3 out of 4 Rabbit Reader CDs. Money in the trash... Frustrating...Worst part? It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for a special need child... :("
2,Does not teach reading and can be fully solved in 3-4 days.,Bought this for my 6 year old who is learning to read.After he started his work it seemed that the read the words for him and that it wasnt obvious that the word on the screen was what was being read. It was more just a fun game for him.After 3-4 days he did everything that was on the screen and was totally finished with the game.
2,Not what I hoped for,"My 5-year old couldn't wait to play with this software (game). He got bored very quickly, so I went to a different game, but he wasn't real impressed there either. He played all the games, but didn't find this very fun or exciting. I was hoping it would be more educational, but found it to be just ""ok""."
1,not working at all,"May be on the older model computers it can be worked - but on the 7xp is not working - from the very beginning the program asks for activation key and purchase a license to use. Then, after a full installation program is loaded but the whole picture is distorted, after a long pause on the screen you can see a menu,but it does not work and the program writes the disk has not been found.So do not recommend buying this product."
1,can't download,The cd would not allow me to download it. I tried 3 different Windows computers and gave up very frustrated after 2 hours of hard work. The product was very cheap looking and the cd freezes often. I can't speak to the software because I have yet to be able to use it properly.
1,Not helpful for the test,"I guess it COULD be different strokes for different folks, but I didn't find this book very helpful for the CSDP test. THe questions were of a different format and covered the material differently. Also, as a previous reviwer pointed out, occasionally the answers are on the facing page, which makes self-testing more difficult. I found the IEEE on-line course MUCH more helpful. This is not sour grapes, because I DID pass the exam."
2,"Good candy, bad price",I thought I was getting 2 lbs (probably was 2 lbs) of this candy and it's delicious but for $17 I only got about 25 pieces of candy
4,Catwoman,"When i saw that Batman legos were out i flipped out. i LOVE lego, and i LOVE batman, it was like the perfect pairing for me. so i had to get the cheapest set since i only had like 5 bucks, and got this one. i normally hate the smaller sets but i was really satisfied with this set for one reason: catwoman. there arent that many female legos, and having catwoman who is one of my personal fav. batman characters available with this cheap set i was really happy. overall i love her bike becuz it never breaks apart. i have wood flooring, so you can imagine how many times i drop my legos while im playing and they break apart. but not her bike which is what i love. i didnt like the dragster however...but still catwoman alone makes the purchase worth it."
5,"Batman and LEGO fans, GET THIS!","Ok, this set is a little on the small side. Despite this, there are a good number of bricks in this set - can't remember the actual number right now. The Batman sets are a little on the pricey side; but since this is the smallest of them, it's the most affordable. You get two minifigs, Batman and Catwoman- that alone is reason enough for fans to pick this set up. Catwoman's motorcycle is great, but you can't rebuild it into very many other things. Batman's dragster - I don't like it on it's own - but it's built of enough parts that there is huge potential for making your own creations. Plus you get some bricks with Bat-symbols on them. This set also includes a good number of tiny less-common bricks that a MOCer would always find useful. A must have for Batman LEGO users."
3,I recomend,"The lego batman Catwoman pursuit has 92 lego pieces needed to build it. The price is $168.95 and for a 92 piece lego set that is alot of money. I will admit that lego sets are fun, but nobody can afford it. I highly recomend that you should lower the price to a more affordable price. Thanks"
3,Not the best one in the Batman set,"The best part about this set is now my son has catwoman and her motor bike. The bat dragster is not designed for rough play though, the front wheel is hoaky and keeps the model from getting a higher rating. On the plus side the pieces are quite nice and can be used for better projects but the limited number of pieces requires you to own more legos to really take advantage."
2,kids joke book,The book is for very young children. I wish I would have known because my 7 year old will never read it. It seriously looks like it is for children 3 years old. There is probably one joke per page and the pages are very thick. I wish I would have known this. Enjoy for small children.
5,funny funny!!!,"This is my 5 year old grandson""s absolute favorite book...it quizical and cute, it will make u laugh. Its simplistic wording will prompt your child to read along. I highly recommend it"
3,Knock knock,4 year old though jokes we funny by book was set up for a younger child and the jokes were appropriate for 4 year old
3,Left us wanting more,"This book is very cute and like another reviewer mentioned, a good start. I just wish there was more to it. My 3 year old loves, and understands all the jokes and it's a blast to hear her telling them after reading it. We just wish it were longer."
3,Knock Knock jokes for the little ones,The kids LOVED this one and had each other laughing at the silliness and the pictures.
3,OK,Product delivered quickly.Children's book one of many.There are many other books out there that are better.I would recommend this to a friend but not my first suggestion.
5,Young children love knock knock jokes,I have 4 young grandsons who are just learning to read. They love silly knock knock jokes. This book encouraged their reading as well as feeding the silliness of the jokes!
2,Not what I expected,"I am very disappointed with this book :( I bought it for my 5yr son so I could help him learn some funny knock knock jokes. I thought I was buying a book FULL of fun knock knock jokes, but when it arrived and we first opened it.....we found a little book that looks like it's made for a 2yr old (has VERY babyish pictures and thick cardboard pages)!!! The biggest let down is that is only has TEN knock knock jokes!! Unbelievable. ... I'll just have to suck it up and search for a new knock knock book..."
4,good but THE BEST,"I dowlaoded this game on my computer and i thought it was one of the best games ever i played the original carnivores game and I loved it! Its was the best game. But, now if you have the same objective exept you hunt ice animals that lowerd it by 1 star so that all i got"
5,HARD TO PUT DOWN,This was a great read and very tough to put down. Cray did a fantastic job of creating wonderful characters like Sid Kaplan that seemed to come to life on the page.
5,Dark page-turner,"This book is not a light ""popcorn"" novel -- I wouldn't want to be a protagonist in one of Cray's novels. Yet it was a page-turner. I had to read and find out if her story was true, and I never predicted the ending."
3,Good Story,"Showing his knowledge of the system, the author has written a densely detailed story that gives readers a lot to work with. Good job."
5,Unbeatable Courtroom Drama,"A character like no other, a courtroom drama like no other, a surprise ending like no other. This is an intelligent, believable thriller. Once you pick it up, you won't be to put it down."
1,Pyramids for Dummies,What a consummate waste of money this book is! It reads like it was written by a 14 year old to be read by 8 year olds. David Macaulay should be ashamed to have written it; and Amazon should be ashamed to be marketing it to literate adults! I resent that Amazon and Mr. Macaulay actually accept money for this worthless publication.
5,David Macaulay has done it again,"Following in the tradition of other terrific books about complex construction projects using simple technology - such as Castle and Cathedral - Macaulay introduces children to the pyramids of ancient Egypt. And once again he hits a homerun, with a storyline that's just informative enough to create context but simple enough for young children to follow. Oh, did I mention the outstanding illustrations? This is a terrific book for kids and children alike. I bought it for my four-year-old son but I ended up learning quite a bit myself."
3,Missing the opera lyrics,Great version. Karl Richter was a great conductor and he does not disappoint here. My only complaint is that the booklet does not include the libretto.
3,Wish there were castrati...,"I purchased this recording on the direction of a friend so I would be familiar with it before seeing it performed at the Lyric Opera. The recording is okay, but it pales in comparison to the unbelievable performance I saw where three (count them THREE) countertenors took on castrati roles. In the end i was disappointed by the lack of high male voices in this recording."
5,Wow,Can't get enough of this CD. Each song has so much meaning and the skill in delivery by the artist is evident.
5,Good movie.,"I will be the first to say that these movies are disgusting, but I love them. Very original. This was bought as a gift, but I watch it all the time when I borrow it."
3,Feast movies,Ok so none of the sequels are as good as the first one. that said I still liked it but then I am a fan of Feast. As the sequels came out they seemed to be more for those of us that thirsted for more without the ground breaking of the original. That said what sequel is better than any original?Still loved it and thank them for giving us some more Feast!!
4,Leftovers from a third course.,"In my Gradebook, I give this one an A. Not quite up to the first two courses but still quite enjoyable. Monsters, gore, nudity, bizarre humor, what more could someone want? I'm still in love with Tat Girl. Recommended for horror fans. Don't let the kids watch it, though."
2,lousy third installment,"loved the first two, the third was shot too much in dark, and used the stupid camera shake effect way too much, loved the first two, hated the third"
2,Another disappointing direct to dvd sequel..,"I have been a big fan of the Feast series since the original came out in theatres. Feast 2 was a decent direct to video movie but Feast 3 is clearly inferior to the first 2 movies. This movie was loaded with tons of gore for all the true horror fans but in my opinion there was just too much silliness throughout the movie. Yes Feast and Feast 2 had their share of comic moments but Feast 3 goes way beyond what the first two movies did with comedy. I am a big supporter of all of Dimension Extreme's horror movies, but the horrible sequels they have been releasing lately are causing me to consider renting them from now on and NOT purchasing them.."
5,its was good,Ok so every thing was here there was noo huge scractches but there where a few small ones! The picture was beutiful except IT WAS SLANTED alo the key chain was nice and shiny and new=> I was satusfied lol amazing
5,never read it...,"it seems to be a big book, but I'm sure it's good anyway. It was a featured advertisement on 8-bit theater for a while, so it might have something to do with sqare, but I'm not sure. They have thier ouw website. I'm sure of that, cause i've been there. I forgot what it was though, so just look for it in search and the website'll give you a good discription of the book"
1,Accubrush Kit doesn't do windows!,"After watching all the videos and reading and re-reading the instructions, I gave the Accubrush a try. There must be some trick to this that I can't master. There's either too much paint on the rollers, too little paint, or some other issue. One complication seems to be when surfaces aren't perfectly smooth. And whose walls are? My conclusion: Accubrush doesn't do windows or doors or edging or trim of any kind, unless you spend the time to touch up everything it's done. It's easier to just trim it out by hand."
4,Well developed characters and an easy read.,"This book had wonderfully well developed characters. My personal favorites were Felecia and ""Litte Teddy"". They made the book worth the effort. The humor is sublime but its there. I would recommend this book to anyone who does not mind sexuality and profanity."
1,Unrelentingly Dismal,"Not just a flawed family, but a flawed narrative. The characters are so tedious and self-important that the book was slow torture to read. Because of the complete lack of sympathy that the characters evoke, when the many bad things happen in this novel, I just didn't care. A tedious novel."
5,They need to make a SEQUEL!!,"I absolutely love this game. Somebody needs to 1. MAKE A SEQUEL and 2. Make it multiplayer and bring it into the online environment! I played it 3 times over a one year period and beat all the scenarious. I thought I was through playing it and sold it at a garage sale. I missed it so much that I went out and bought another copy within 30 days! I have to have it on my home computer.You will love this game if you like the tycoon games.Programmers (if you're listening), please MAKE A SEQUEL WITH MORE SCENARIOS AND INTERACTIVE ONLINE!!! Fans are waiting!!"
1,Gold Edition NOT HD,"Program Crashes, and resolution is not compatible with my computer. Wish they had a patch that fixed this, instead there is an HD version you can buy. Too bad I can't refund this for the HD version."
1,Risky Purchase,"I purchased the game, it loaded but does not play.Re-loaded, to no avail.I recommend looking for another game for entertainment.A six pack of beer will give you more entertainment for your buck."
5,Great game!!!,"I've played this game since it first came out before the northern expansion, bought it again with it, bought it again gold edition. Gold is absolutely the best because once you load it, you never need the disc to start it. It's great whenever you want a quick game 15mins.-an hour or so. Now my kids are old enough to play it and enjoy it, too. Deal with the demon does not have a demon in it. I've never noticed if any of the charachters are topless, I guess that you would have to really be looking for that to find it...the charachters are quite small you would need a magnifier to notice I think. My son could play this easily at 6. I think if your child were interested he/she could play this as young as 4 or whenever they can start reading, or with help. You can network this and play as a family which is fun and safer than the internet. But for adults that want to unwind this sure beats out solitaire or minesweeper!!!"
5,Best PC game.... EVER!,"I have Majesty for PC and it ROCKS! Talk about fun, it's got all these cool monsters, heros, buildings, and what not. I don't own very many PC games so i'm glad I got this game. The only down side is that you eventually want to get new buildings and people. Other than that, this is a great game that involves a lot of knowledge of how to really rule a knigdom."
4,Technical Comment,"WinXP users with DirectX9 and nVidia viedo cards that can't see the beginning movie after install making the game unplayable - Start Menu, Run, DXDiag, Display Tab, Disable DirectDraw Acceleration. (Remember to turn it back on after you are done.) ***Leave everyone a comment if it also occurs in Vista and is a vaild fix too.***Currently additional downloadable quests from the manufacturer are not supported on the 'Gold' edition:- The Wrath of Krolm- The Balance of Twlight"
3,I'll buy that for a dollar!,i was disappointed the game kept freezing on my Windows 7 machine. i installed it on my Win XP system and it worked. i finished a few levels and am pleased with the game. the vampires suck though. they kept killing my rangers.
1,Crashes repeatedly,"I broke my own rule of ""try before you buy"" and regret it. This game crashes within the first 15 minutes EVERY time I start it."
1,Nice Game too bad it isn't compatable,"I was able to play the first couple quests with little or no problem. The last of the beginners quests freezes me every time, I can't work past it. It's a nice little game, what I saw of it. Reading the other reviews leads me to believe it's a coding issue. Maybe if they took the time to recode it properly it would do well."
2,"Great game, If it worked!","Majesty is pretty much one of my favorite computer games.. With that said, I wish the one I downloaded from amazon worked! It freezes constantly and none of my other games ever do (sims, diablo, black and white, etc;) I can't even get through one level without the program deciding to randomly be ""not responding"" BUY THE DISK, DON'T DOWNLOAD IT."
4,"A great, enjoyable game!","First of all, this version is a substantial improvement over the original, because the music actually works!The game itself is a blast - easy to learn, but not so easy to master. You can learn the strategies, and you can be successful, yet the game isn't so easy that you can simply ""win"" it in an hour.In otherwords, it's within almost everybody's capabilities. It won't leave you feeling stupid, and it's not a cakewalk either.One gripe - why is the Northern expansion seperate from the regular edition, when the Northern expansion INCLUDES the regular edition? If you start playing games in the regular edition, then go to the Norhtern expansion, you lose all the games you won beforehand. Wierd.Overall, very enjoyable. Get the gold edition."
3,Eh...,"My desktop computer was unable to run this game due to the out of date software, but my six-year old laptop got it going. From what I hear, in it's day this game rocked. Perhaps if I had played it in it's prime I would have been really impressed as well, but judged by today's simulation game standards it is a relic of the genre. It was mildly entertaining and I applaud the hard work that no doubt went into it's development, but it only held my attention for a couple of days before it was banished to the retired game shelf in my office."
1,Not a mac game,Can't download the game on a mac. I was very disappointed they didn't really say if you could or couldn't in the writing.
5,An eccentric piece both elegant and weird,"""Sobrero Fallout"" stands as Brautigan's most overlooked work. Coming as it did after a few throwaways, (""The Hawkline Monster"" and ""Willard and His Bowling Trophies"") people had Brautigan written off and this attracted no new readers to its insanity. Which is a shame. The story itself is split into two sides. One revolves around a Sombrero which falls from the sky and the ensuing argument over who, EXACTLY, is going to pick it up. This results in the National Guard being called out and all sorts of nonsense. This is fun stuff, but it's the other story, of Brautigan's pining over his lost relationship with a Japanese woman, that stands as one of his very best. Do not pass this book up, if you can find it! A truly unique vision"
4,Good Buy,Very happy thry look great in my new car. If I am going to buy car mats in the future I would buy these again.
3,'The Best Of' without Red Hot?,"I have been expecting this compilation in the last two years with a list of Vanessa's best songs in mind. When it hit the CD shop, my first impression is: Where the hell is Red Hot? Where are Cotton Eye Joe and Theme from Caravan?This album may not be bad, but the title doesn't match its contents. You must also buy The Violin Player to get a decent collection of Vanessa's best."
2,WRONG CD!!!!,"Amazon first delayed my cd, then they sent me the wrong cd. When the cd arrived, the artwork on the cover was correct, but the cd itself was missing the two bonus tracks listed for this version of the recording."
5,Excellent introduction to Apache Jakarta and beyond,"If you ever wonder how to keep up with the open-source explosion especially with respect to Java tools and technologies, here is one book that could come in your assistance. Very well written, simple to understand and easy to read examples explain various open-source technologies that can take you beyond Jakarta and a bit more. May be next year we can see the 2nd edition that can talk about the advances made in the last couple of years or so :-).-SB"
1,This tribute = Insult,"If I could give this a rating of ""0"" stars, I would. But the lowest you can give it is 1 star. This has to be the worst piece of garbage I have ever heard. It sounds like someone hired 1 band to play all the Blondie songs on this album and then just made up 19 phony and fake 'band' names....Even the vocals sound like one girl! There are NO MUSIC/VOCAL credits in the notes which also confirms the falseness of this disaster. I listened to this CD 4 times very carefully, searching for one shread of quality but found nothing. I was embarrassed I bought it and fustrated I couldn't return it. I mean, come on.....the record label is ""Dressed To Kill"". Who ever heard of them!?! The liner notes are absent, there's no one to complain to once you buy it. Use your money for something else. The members of Blondie should sue for character defamation."
1,Hang the DJ!,"I'll be brief as what I've heard deserves less than that, yet needs to be communicated. This release is a rather unfortunate waste of everything involved in the prosess, besides maybe those lucky enough to get some money from it, hopefully no-one but the artists who's work has been made a mockery of here. It's dreadfull. It's disturding that a band as great as Blondie (or anyone), has to see something like this as a so-called tribute. Hang the DJ."
1,AWFUL!,"Stay with the originals! I'd love to see a great Blondie tribute cd, but have been disappointed so far...The female singers on this cd just seem like pale imitations of Deborah Harry - they are trying too hard to sound like her. Also, the cover features a dreadful painting of Harry (the rest of Blondie are nowhere to be seen), which makes it all the more distasteful and cheesy! Do yourself a favor - buy ""No Exit"" or ""Parallel Lines"" instead!"
5,A must have for all,Blondie is still the most top rated of all time! These songs were not the remixes one might expect. While all her lyrics are intact the band's music is much improved.It is all their hit's and very high on the charts position song's. You will not believe how terrific her voice is! Buy this one!
2,REALLY DISAPPOINTING!,"Now here is a great collection of traditional hymns of praise & worship that you'd expect to be fabulous listening given the great voices offered on this cd. The problem lies in the really crappy arrangements. Here you will get to listen to LEANING ON THE EVERLASTING ARMS, arranged to sound like something you'd hear at a cocktail lounge! Songs whose tempo should be somewhat upbeat like, NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD, is slowed down to a really boring cadence that becomes just plain irritating. There are much, much better versions of all these sacred songs to be found on other recordings. The only one worth listening to is the last track: HE TOUCHED ME, by The Isaacs, and they couldn't mess up any song even if they tried. Save your money & skip this one."
1,Pass on this,If you really like gospel music don't waste your money on this CD. These beautiful hymns deserve better treatment. Flat and uninspired is a generous description for this CD.
2,Totally Uninspired,"Let's just say it's a good thing these singers have day jobs. Don't quit them anytime soon. Except for a couple of the songs (Softy and Tenderly, Victory in Jesus, Leaning on the Everlasting Arms, and maybe one other one), this CD is a waste. Totally uninspired singing, basic and unoriginal background music - my church's youth group can outdo this bunch of country westerners singing gospel music songs!"
3,Great idea...Mediocre execution,"I have to say, I was thrilled when I heard this book was coming out. There are so many holes in my knowledge, I couldn't believe that someone had taken the time to put all of this information together. As soon as I got it home I looked to see if he correctly had some obscure numbers I knew. In all three cases the book was incorrect. There are mutiple errors throughout the team roster section.Additionally, some the material presented in other chapters barely seem germane to the numbers worn by players on the field.All in all, quite an undertaking, but I was disapointed."
4,Lots of numbers. Especially between 1 and 99.,"Man, the numbers this bad boy's got in it! I went looking for numbers the other day, then i remembered ""Hey, I got a book that's practically nothing but numbers!"" So I found the number I wanted. Instantly. One caveat: don't pay full price, as some of the numbers within are advertised as prime numbers, but really aren't (e.g. 35, 49, 69)."
4,Too good for the dollar store,"It's not as good as Gillette HydraGel, but it's cheaper. I buy mine from the dollar store, although it's better quality than anything else in the store."
5,Excellent product,By far the best shaving cream I have used. I won't use any other brand but Barbasol. It's good and inexpensive.
2,Sensitive skin? Stay away!,"Alright, so I decided to try this product because I ran out of my normal gel and was on the run and this is what was available at the local store in a small town while I was visiting my parents. Growing up I had an acne problem, but my skin had been clear for years... A week after using this product, I began breaking out with acne ALL over the area that I covered with the shaving cream. I immediately threw out this product. The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because I did shave well with it, but the effects of it on sensitive skin are HORRENDOUS. I repeat, if you have sensitive skin or are the least bit prone to acne, do not buy this product."
2,It's not Menthol,"I was fooled by the color of the can into thinking this was the old Barbasol menthol I used to use and love, but couldn't find anymore. But alas, this was just a run-of-the-mill shaving cream with a different smell and no menthol kick. After years of searching several countries for menthol shaving cream, I have the answer. Barbasol produces it's menthol shaving cream for a foreign customer and keeps some in the US warehouse to sell to us old people who still want it. You can buy a case from Rochell at 1-800-841-3221. This is the result of three years of hunting for menthol shaving cream! Life is good"
3,Beware recent change,"IF you've been using this shaving cream for many years, beware -- it seems that Barbasol has changed the scent of this can (as of mid-November 2010, possibly a few months or a year earlier.)The scent is more acrid, lemony, sharper. And what's worse, the scent seems to stay with you longer -- doesn't wash off, so you're basically putting on a perfume that will last for at least a couple of hours. My wife hasn't really loved the change, so I've got to find a new aftershave... sigh, after all these years, they couldn't leave well enough alone."
1,Don't know how Grandpa tolerated it,"I picked this stuff up on a trip and used most of the can before throwing it out. For me the negative effects were cumulative... at first it worked fine (and I felt tough and old school), but after a couple of months I realized my skin had become really tight, dried out, and sensitive. The problems disappeared after my wife replaced the Barbasol with some fancy stuff. Guess I'm just a pampered wuss."
2,Well my son likes it....,"... but it's not as good as some of the others. Flat graphics and unimaginative games make this one less than stellar. For the 3-6 year old set I'd recommend Bob the Builder, or Clifford. However, your child will probably love it as much as mine does."
3,Good - could be better,"I got this CD for my toddler because he LOVES the Reader Rabbit Playtime for Baby & Toddler! (Which I highly recommend!) The Reader Rabbit Learn to Read with Phonics, on the otherhand, is not nearly as good. The quality of the animation and the ""fun-ness factor"" are not there. It is more educational, but your child has got to want to use it, and mine just asks me to put in the other Reader Rabbit."
2,No technical support and no upgrades,"This game was bought for my son 1-2 years ago when he was a toddler. Now that he's four we started using it. There is an error in the piano game that basically teaches your child how to spell words incorrectly putting in lots of incorrect letters at random. The piano game features prominently in many of the exercises, so you basically have to do a work around throughout the entire process.What really gets me though is 1) I recently bought what I thought was an upgraded version of the game only to find the problem had not been fixed by the manufacturer 1) there are no patches or upgrades available to fix the problem, 2) the manufacturer states on their website that they will not give a refund for this game. Buyer beware."
1,doesn't run on mac os x,"there's no support information available regarding failure to run on mac os x platform. i was unaware of the problem because the product is advertised as macintosh compatible, and only subsequently discovered that others have run into the same difficulty after searching online for troubleshooting help."
5,Road to reading is superb.,"Once my daughter strated on Road to Reading, she was not ready to stop. After coming back from the daycare, she would play it for at least two hours everyday. She reached the end of the road after 5 days and what a sense of achievement she had. She did learn quite a bit while playing this game."
1,What a Disappointment!,"I remember when this series had snappy graphics and good customer support. My disk arrived today. We installed. We re-installed. The graphics froze, or the music/sound disappeared, or both as soon as we accessed any of the puzzles. We looked for customer service from the reader rabbit website. It was not a website that was intended to make customer inquiries easy. We received an automated response from Broderlund, that was followed by a second message telling us that tech support was now being done by another firm. So, I registered my issue with that company. Another automated response directing me to another website. More FAQs. And the 'Contact Us' button sends you to the same address that generates the automated response.Might be a decent program - but you better hope nothing ever goes wrong!!!"
1,Want to lower your opinion of Bogart? Read this trash.,"This book contains way too much guessing and supposition about what Humphrey Bogart did, especially in his younger days. He was no saint, but some of this isn't worth the dust I let collect on it after a couple of quick reading sessions."
2,Too heavy,"I ordered two pair of these for my vacation. I ordered one in my regular size and one a size larger. Both pairs were too small. In addition, the shoe is extremely heavy for a sneaker."
3,work shoes,I am unable to work in these for more then 2 or 3 hours. These shoe start to hurt my toes within that time.
4,They will do,a 8.5 wide should be fine but seem to have a problem with the leftfoot one. I have only worn for a couple of days so maybe they willget better broke in by more ware.
2,Uncomfortable!,"I work retail and spend a minimum of 6 hours on my feet daily. By the end of a shift wearing these shoes my feet were killing me. They look nice and I like the thick soles. However, if you do a lot of walking, you will definitely find yourself regretting this purchase as I did."
5,Great Sneakers!,"Great fit! Wide width accomodates the foot very nicely. Excellent arch support, and great shock-absorbing sole. They also look great!"
1,Disappointed - shoe review said it was leather.,I chose this rating because they lied in the review. The only reason I bought the shoe was because the summary said it was leather. It is NOT leather - it is some kind of plastic stuff. I really liked the style and the thick sole but I do not want plastic.
5,Great walkers,"Bought for my mum, such a good price, really comfortable and look great. Delivered on time and in excellent condition."
1,Not the best of Scechers,Not good not for standing not for walking and I am doing it a lot. Sims like they was made to just sit on the shelf and look pretty.My body had to adjust to this inflexible shoes and not other way around. This is was painful experience.
2,Winsock 2.0 is outdated?,"The title may be Winsock 2.0 but the book concentrates on Winsock 1.1 for Windows 3.11. VERY disappointing. There are a few chapters on Winsock 2.0 but the bulk of the book was clearly written a long time ago. Had I read it 4 years ago, I'd have given it 4-5 stars."
1,The one thing this book is good for is a fire,"Unless you know everything about WinSock then this book isnt for you. Get a decent book, ""Windows Network Socket Programming"""
4,Good coverage in plain English,"I still haven't read the last section of the book, but I can tell you that the first 2 sections are well-organized, well-written and the example programs work.Excellent introduction to WinSock programming."
2,"Only vanilla Winsock, no coverage of SPI programming.","The areas of Winsock it covered, it covered OK. For anyone concerned with using Winsock 2 for its ability to use non-TCP/IP networks, the SPI functions are only mensioned once and none of the sample code contains any SPI WSP* functions."
5,Perfect,"We've had this pressure cooker for almost a year now. It's become an indispensable part of our kitchen. Everything cooks perfect in it from brown rice, potatoes to pasta. Excellent quality. Worth every penny."
3,Doesnt fit.,This does not fit the sony DCR-dvd101 as it says in description.good lens if it fit my cam.
4,Works well in good light,"I used this exclusively for helmet cam footage while downhill mountain biking in Whistler BC. It produced some great footage but it needs bright light, everything in the trees suffered so I used the Canon's for the chutes and ladders:)"
4,"Nice, but a little tight","These were extremely nice, however, when compared to the Speedo brand, these are on the smaller side of a given size.If you order a 38, make sure you have EXTRA room when wearing 38s.Fortunately, unlike the Speedos, these handle washes much better and don't look abused after just a washing or two."
5,outstanding!,"A wonderful performance from the Sixteen and Harry Christophers.Just as the 19th C developed a romanticized version of classical music, i.e. sonata form, the early baroque-era composers like schutz, monteverdi, etc. ""romanticized"" renaissance-style choral music, and this disk of Scarlatti is an excellent example. His Stabat Mater is rich in amazing 10-voice polyphony of a much more ""romantic"" sort (amazing dissonances and harmonic colors, with occasionally some solo/soli sections alternating with polyphony, in a concerto style) than that found in Josquin et al. This is thoroughly contrapuntal music, actually more than I expected from Domenico Scarlatti. Perhaps there is some comparison to Schutz, though this is somewhat warmer, more italianate and completely ravishing!"
1,Useless,":(I hate getting jipped.This very thin ""book"" is a sales pitch for their more expensive book and website membership. It appears to be written in a hurry and stretched out. This is basically a single sales pamphlet stretched out to appear like a book ... most of the paragraphs are single sentences! Very poorly organized, but there is so little info to organize in the first place.I recommend spending your money on a good on-line publishing or advertising/marketing book."
1,Terrible book... doesn't even have table of contents.,"The book is a big disappointment. The information is not well organized and too general. No true ""hot to"" steps of how to get specific tasks done, just a bunch of ideas jumbled up. Seems just to be something thrown together to help sell another supposedly more indepth book that they promote inside this one. Only worth while if you just are looking for general topics of things you might need to take into account, but not good for serious practical detailed information. No table of context, no index.... it is a bad book."
2,Not really good,If you have access to any home improvement stores you are better off to go buy your own compared to this. It is over priced and the 12 oz. goes way to fast. Did it work? Yes it did but not any better than what you buy at Lowe's or Home Depot. I was dissappointed overall.
2,Doesn't help,"Doesn't help to kill mealy bags on my houseplant, as promise in Recommendations to Use. Bottle is small."
4,Effective & Easy to Use,"This product lives us to its claims. It solved the problem after only one application. It took a few weeks for delivery, but fortunately it was worth the wait."
4,Great value overall,"Pros:- Very good quality printing, takes few minutes togo through the alignment (follow the documentation)- The ink's are much cheaper to refill ( best thing!)- Not too bigCons:- While shutting does some noisy operation before completely shutting down.But if you want all-in-one and best value for money- go for this one!"
2,"Bad scanner, (Very very slow!) Good Printer","Scans are slow, slow slow slow!! Slow to the point of uselessness, to scan a copy of my Amazon receipt took over 5 minutes, as opposed to my older Epson 1660 which took 4 seconds.The MP370 is USB 1.0 vs the Epson's USB2.0, (why the Mp370 takes so long?) On the plus side the scans are sharp and detailed once they finally arrive, and the prints are nice, though there are only 2 cartridges: a very small Color one and a cheap nice BW, unlike most other newer Canons that feature individual color specific ones. If I could return it, I would. Then I would get a nice Canon printer with individual tanks and a nice Epson scanner separately. As a bonus this solution would work with my OSX Macs, (the MP370 features NO mac drivers, even just for printing.)"
5,Hefty 39 Gallon Cinch Sak Lawn and Leaf Bags,"These bags are sturdy and good to use for lawn waste. Other bags will rip with the weight of the contents, but these are sturdy and right for the job."
5,Coaching Board,"As a High School coach, this product is of great value when assigning players to defensive positions and batting order. The Coacher Board makes substituions easy and the players understand where they are going to play and where they will hit in the order. A real ""must"" for the organized coach."
2,Significant prolems...,"This book covers a beautiful part of the world for hiking. While the verbal content is ok, the graphic content is very poor. The first problem is that there are too few maps, and those that are presented are not well done. Having good maps -- or even just ADEQUATE maps -- would have greatly improved this book.The second significant problem is that while there are many illustrations, NONE of them are labled...! I can hardly believe it, but it's true. While none of us really need to be told ""this is a bald eagle"", there are many illustrations of flowers and trees that would have real meaning if the species were identified.Too bad.So that leaves us with the actual written content of the book, which is good. Unfortuately that can not stand on its own."
3,Good info but not updated,"If you are an avid SW RPG gamer, you should know this SWRPG supplement is one of the best around for the most interesting planet on the Star Wars saga, it has a lot of info from the movies, the novels and the New Rebellion Era Stuff, the only downside thing is that only covers the things you see in the classic trilogy and Episode I, so you won't get any info on the updated Episode II stuff. Not so bad, but it would be great if they update the thing. Besides that, is a good supplement"
2,A disappointment,"The Swingle Singers are always good, but this is a very short CD (under 30 minutes) and the arrangements are pedestrian. A disppointment"
5,Inspiration for All Ages,"I had the good fortune to see this film when it first came out: when I was five years old. Mum and Dad had already read many of the Beatrix Potter tales to me: this film made me only a stronger fan. This film also inspired me to dance, at first as a five-year-old prancing round the living room and later as a student of dance, and all along it made me a huge fan of ballet. May I humbly recommend parents, grandparents, or aunts and uncles give the gift of this film, the soundtrack, the books, and lots of space in the living room to the children in your lives?And then, after you have shown the kids how nifty the ballet is in the film, won't you please take the little ones to a real ballet? It's in 3-D!Thankfully, everything except the ballet tickets can be found here on Amazon.com."
1,The most useless book ever written,"This book is a waste of money. The authors are two academics with one industry job between them. The writing style and content are bureaucratic and BORING. There are at least three sentences for every thought transition and by the time you get to the point, you've forgotten what you've read."
3,Okay...,"Although it is an exhaustive book on staffing organizations, sometimes it is not as ""down to the point"" as I would have liked. However, the diagrams and summaries at the end are beneficial."
1,Staffing Organizations,"I was very dissapointed when I received the book. It had been advertised as ""like new"". In fact, the text is full of highlights and written notes.This was the first and last time I buy a textbook from Amazon."
1,WORST of the WORST of the WORST,"I have never had such a bad experience with a seller like this. They didn't respond to any email I sent, didn't send out the book before the deadline and send me a book of old edition whose cover is different from what I saw on line when I placed the order. Yes, they did respond my email, but very very late and of no courtesy, rude."
5,Extremely Satisfied,I recieved the book promptly and in great condition. I would buy from this supplier again in the future.
3,Student opinion,"I am currently reading this book for a class. The class consensus is that is has useful information but it is written in a research manner vs. a teaching/learning manner. This makes it an extremely dry and boring read much of the time. The chapter on measurements was excrutiating to read and retain. It is definately written with larger corporations in mind. As useful as the information in this book is, it is written in a manner that is not as conducive to student learning in my opinion. I think that this book could be much better than it is."
1,Not what it explained,I tried numerous times to contact the seller and never got a response back. I tried every type of way to get a hold of them and there was nothing. The book stated it was new and it had highlighting and pen all over it. I couldn't return the book to get my money back because I needed a new book right away because it was for class. Unfortunatly I paid $130 for a new book that wasn't new.
4,Amazing!,"I just connected this monitor and the image is amazing, easy setup, bright image and great colors. My old crt is a piece of junk compared to this lcd. I gave it a 4 star because I just got it and havent done much with it, but I sure recommend it."
3,"So-so. A review of ""SpongeBob SquarePants: The Essential Guide""","I picked this book up at the library to see what it was like. It was interesting but I wasn't blown away. Barely the occasional snicker.There is a map of Bikini Bottom, floor plan of Mr. SquarePant's home, and the requisite biographies about the principle characters, but not the sort and amount of humor one might wish for if actually spending hard-cold cash. [SpongeBob is portrayed as such a two-dimensional character... when we know he has such depth!]**Chapter Headings**SpongeBob SquarePantsPatrick StarSquidward TentaclesBikini BottomSpongeBob's HouseEugene H.

3,It's a statue,"Stealth Jumper Batman is tall, balanced well, detailed, and cool looking. But it lacks the articulate range of other DC Direct Batman figures/ for examples: -Long Halloween/ Dark Victory Batman, -Batman Inc. Batman, -(even my) New 52 DC Direct Batman has more range than the Hush figures. Spend $5-8 at most either MISB or loose. I found a seller @ $6. This was my second disapointment in Batman's DC Direct versions- the first was the Arkham Asylum DC Direct statues. And I know that theyre suppose to be display pieces, but I think you should get a bit more out of it for your buck."
1,Tourists guide Book To Salt Lake City,This book is a reprint of old publication. 1897Very deceptive.Never tells that it is a reprint.
2,countdown to kindergarten,"So I just received this book along with ""the night before kindergarten"". These books came 1 day before scheduled delivery, so thumbs up. I like how the book is large. The illustrations are cute. But I thought this book would be more about preparing for kindergarten. Instead it was about a little girl that didn't know how to tie her shoes, but it all became OK after realising it wasn't a bad thing. Not my personal preference. I am no longer buying kids books from amazon. I'd rather go to a store and read through before buying. Also on the other book there was damage from shipping and/or packaging. Just not worth the hassle buying kid books from amazon."
2,Only for collectors,"Twelve Slovak songs, put to music by Gejza Dusik and performed by operatic voices. Of course, the songs are not Slovak folksongs, they came from the few operettas that Dusik has composed.Sadly, one needs to know this; the sleeve notes make no mention of this, just a list, with the names of the performers. Unfornunately, the sound quality is also poor. There is little base and the heights are audibly clipped. This CD is likely of interest only to those who understand Slovak or at least insist on owning all Dusik's materials.Those, who want the emotional recording of ""Piesen o rodnej zemi"" from the operetta ""The Potters Ball"" should try to get the live Dvorsky's performance taped in Bratislava. The sound is much better, the audience feedback is great and the phrasing is much better as well. The LP's are still available in Slovakia and Czech Republic."
2,Party pooper,"So my cat must be the party pooper because she has very little interest in this toy. She will bat the ball a few times and walk away. I wish she'd use the scratcher, but she prefers my furniture where she can stretch and shred simultaneously. (wah-wah) As far as the price, well it appears that you could buy the base with a ping-pong ball for $10 and a separate starchaser lighted ball for $5. Or you could buy this for $30. Something just doesn't add up."
5,starchaser cat toy,My cat loves this toy and plays with it every day. the middle scratcher was the first thing he used when I brought him home.
4,My cat loves it but I wish the lights on the ball would work regularly.,"My cat loves to play with it, however it came defective. The light on the ball works only sometimes. And when it does, my cat gets the best out of it. Other than that, it is very safe; no sharp edges, nothing loose, nothing to swallow. Plus the scratch pad is changeable.I contacted amazon for an exchange when I realized the light is not working properly. They send me a shipping label for the return but in the meantime my husband got rid of the packaging, so I decided to keep it. Customer service and the product is great. I am only giving it a four stars because of this defect. I would recommend it to my friends and family. Just make sure everything works before throwing out the package."
2,I Want More Dean and Less Kemper,"For a book supposedly about Dean Kamen's quest to change the world, it is surprisingly more about the author and less about his subject. I was hoping for a great book about Dean Kamen - his work with FIRST (www.usfirst.org) and how he truly has changed at least a part of this worold. Instead I got the story of Steve Kemper. Wait for the real story."
3,Kemper got it right,"As someone who is very familiar with the events described, I know that Kemper did a reasonably good job describing the key events that led to the infamous Ginger leak in early 2001. The characters are conveyed well, he has a good handle on the story, and Kemper sees the flaws in Kamen's plan--and the biggest flaw is egomaniacial Kamen himself and the other ridiculously outsized egos he corrals for this project.Regardless of what you think of Segway, this is an interesting story of* what happens when ""genius"" is unchecked by lesser beings* what happens when a business owner doesn't recognize that he lacks the skills needed to run what he created* how VCs and investment banks approach new businesses in what I'll call a suboptimal manner* what happens when someone thinks their (good) idea is more important than it really is.There are lots of conflicts here that Kemper does a good job of outlining. All in all, it's not bad for a business book."
5,aka Code Name Great Read,"I've always admired Kamen and his work. To get this up close, and personal view was a real treat. Kemper captured the people and the process in a way that made the book very compelling reading. His ""fly-on-the-wall"" perspective was fantastic. The meetings (especially the one described in chapter 15) are painfully familiar and funny. The same is true for the interactions between engineers and marketers. Great read!"
5,Perfect for country kids,"I'm a librarian in rural Washington. The Bubba and Beau series is perfect for country Dads and Grandpas to read to kids age 3-8. I especially like this one, because it shows big and little Bubba traveling together. Where I live most kids do travel with their dads running errands for the farm."
3,Finally someone provides an overview of the Armagnac region,"This book has (some) values for all Armagnac-interested persons. For the novice will it provide ample information about Armagnac (what is it, where is it, etc) and for the 'half-pro', many tasting notes and details of producers. For a 'professional' Armagnac drinker, however, the details about the individual producers are somewhat lacking; also it suffers from the absolute lack of color pictures (only b/w), but all-in-all recommendable (basically since no other documentation on the subject exists)"
5,Finally something you can read and enjoy,This book one of the rarest ocasions in SCM field when you read a book and enjoy its contents to the fullest. I agree with ine of the other reviewers that this is one of the BEST books about SCM. I highly recomend it as one of MUST have SCM books.
2,Missing the edition in the description,The book took two weeks to arrive. I wish that they had put the edition number in the description. I needed to get the 3rd edition and this book is the 2nd. I will make sure to email next time to to duble check on everything.
4,practical,This indeed is a very practical book on a difficult subject like supply chain management . Very well illustrated with examples and exercises.
2,"Could be better, not quantitative",Although this book has some good case histories I found the mathematics and quantitative analysis very weak. Equations are just pulled from the blue and put down with no explanation of how they are derived or their limitations. The authors spend a great deal of time describing in full detail the case histories. It took me a long time to get through the many pages of the Barilla pasta company story -- even though I am a pasta lover. From a non-quantitative view the book is good. I did not try the CD with the beer game supplied. I wish that maybe the authors will consider a second edition where they are more careful with the mathematics and explain the quantitative aspects of supply chains more carefully. As a PhD scientist I am curious on how the authors derived some of their analytical expresssions.
2,"OK, what was ALL the hype about","My sister recommend that I read this book, so I ordered it and my only question is, ""What was all the hype about."" It was an ok book but it was NOT a page turner. I finished it because I pay for it. Just another 'hood story"
4,Winter Santiaga,"The most talked about urban book that I know of, is not what I expected it to be. This was the first novel I read by Sister Souljah and I am not overly impressed by her writing, but I do give her the brownie points she deserves for her original story plot.Although the review of ths book has been written much better than I can write it (in the publishers weekly column), I would have to add that this story takes a lot of twists and turns in Winter Santiaga's life since her father had been locked up and her mother no longer around. She is by herself on the streets and this adventure is fascinating.This is a book that I read in only 2 days because of its fast paced character Winter. I would recommend purchasing this book because it is a classic to have in your urban book collection. In addition it is a great book to teach the female youth about whats ""really"" going on."
5,Chills down my spine,"I wouldnt be able to explain to you how jaw dropping this book is. It is too realistic for words. I felt as if I was feeling for Winter but I also felt that she put herself in those bad situations because of her attitude. I wanted her to get what she wanted but she needed to get her act together too. What really got me was the end, when she ends up in a relationship like her parents and ends up disfigured like her mother. I think young girls can learn from Winter's experiences. Life doesnt revovle around you and your needs only. This book is miraculous. I would recommend to all."
4,DISASTROUS END OF A DRUG FAMILY,"coldest Winter Ever is a book that exposes the activities of drug dealers. Sister Souljah was a personality that was used to speak against the drug dealers. She spoke about the implications of drug and how it negatively affects the users. Thus, sister Souljah's mission was to warn the drug dealers about the consequences and also discourage the users.Again, Coldest Winter Ever though a book meant to narrate the unprofitable end of drug dealers but the tone of the book has lots of profanity. The book depicts that power and money, can attract respect, comfort and satisfaction; however, the language of the novel does not have moral background and should not be recommended for teenagers."
5,"""All That""","This book was rivoting and powerful that Sister SoulJah wrote.It was a page-turner,sneak - peeker opener, family oriental.This family developed so much wrong way that they couldn't see no wrong come their way. However, truth be told . Something good came out the situation - twins can turn things around.There is always hope.I just hope whoever is going through this find help,and faithas Winter throught she was seeking.Never take greed for granted. Having ""All That"" only means nothing""."
3,UNBELEIVABLE!!!!!,"I am amazed that the drama of drugs has not been rehabilitated in this day and age of our society.What a waste of writing talent, the story line has been done time and time again but never any success stories, Everybody dies, even if they live, death is present. Ask the real (GODFATHER) GOD THE FATHER our CREATOR. RISE young people above the imaginations of negativity, RISE I say to the freedom of not being a number but you too a SOULJAH!! In God's Army"
4,The best book I have read in a long time,"Sister Souljah's book is definitely one of the best books I have read in a long time. Being a young african-american woman, I felt like the main character was one of my friends. The issues she had I've dealt with myself. Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. I haven't read any of her other books yet but, I must say that if they are all as enjoyable as this, I am definetly going to make it a priority to read them."
5,Insightful and Fabulous!,This book has given me a completely new respect for Sister Souljah. An absolute page turner. Her writing is both candid and three dimentional. Winter has never been so hot! My only question...When is Souljah going to bless us with another novel?
5,THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL!!!!!!,I DON'T CARE WHAT NOBOBY SAYS THIS BOOK IS THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL......PERIOD!!!!!THE FIRST TIME I READ THIS BOOK ( I HAVE SEVERAL TIMES) I READ IT IN ONE SITTING. THIS IS THE ONE EVERYONE TRIES TO TOP. I HOPE SISTA SOULJAH WRITES PORSHA'S STORY...
4,Shorty was straight up on a paper chase,"Dont sleep on women, we know how to get that paper dog!Very good book!"
3,It was o.k,"The Coldest Winter Ever was o.k.Everyone hyped me up to reading this book,and when i finally read it,it wasn't what I had really expected.the book wasn't corny at all.I liked the book,but it wasntt what I had planned to read.I didnt want it to end the way it had,but if you haven't read it you should read it."
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros: This book was a real page turner. The characters and plot were well developed. Entertaining.Cons: I sometimes here this book placed into the same category as Push by Saphire, The Color Purple, and There Eyese Were Watching God. But her prose lacks style and is rough on the edges. I would recommend the above three books far above this one.Edit: As a teacher in the South Bronx, I am well aware of the conflicts that teens face, but I wonder if this book is counter-productive in that I see it being passed around and it's really popular among the kids and I would hope they learn from Winter's story. However, I feel that sometimes Sistah Souljah glamorized that lifestyle, without meaning to off course. The kids like it because of the drama, but I highly doubt they would say, ""Hey, I don't want to end up like Winter."" I'd just read this for entertainment. I know that's what my students read it for."
3,Didn't get with this one,"I give this book 3 stars b/c it kept me interested---for a while, but this is just not my type of book. I was in either middle or high school when I read this, and this was the book that everyone was talking about.I just can't get with stories like this. I prefer more cleverly written stories than this one. It is an interesting read though. Halfway through I started skipping around and then was confused at the end. I just couldn't completely enjoy this book.You might like it."
5,The best book I read this year,This book should be read by all teenagers in a high risk environment. It was so good that I couldn't put it down.
5,This book is a taste of reality!,"Many people don't think that young people go through things like Winter experienced. Unfortunately it's true. I can relate to Winter in most aspects, and most I can't. She had to experience the hardships of life at an early age. I read this book 2 years ago and it's still vivid in my mind. Keep doing what ya doing Sistah and may God bless you."
5,"""Old Man's"" Winter","It was once said, ""if it does not snow in the Winter, something bad is bound to happen."" Otherwise known as ""Old Man's Winter!"" This is in comparison to the life Winter endured, in the novel ""The Coldest Winter Ever"" by Sister Souljah. When her father, Rickey Santiaga, money was cut off (due to some bad choices he made in life), his life and his family's life was headed down a dead end road...I can't blame her for the way she acted. She was taught to act the way she did, which is highly emphasized in the environment her father brought her up in. It just goes to show, you may think you are teaching your child what's right, but yet the whole time no morals toward life are being demonstrated in your lessons. I guess the snow or the money, didn't hit home, as it was expected to."
5,The Coldest Book Ever,"This was about one of the greatest books I have ever read. I usually don't have time to read, but I have to tell you this book made me read it twice because I felt like I was actually in Winter's (the main characters)wonderland. I took it with me when I got my hair braided. It took my braid artist longer to braid my hair than for me to finish this book. I read it in 7 hours. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an entrance into a world they don't know, want to know, or have known."
1,Only gave it 1 star because I had to,"Am I the only one who thinks this book was a moronic, self-indulgent stereotypical-black-girl fantasy that insults the intelligence of young black females everywhere? Winter is drawn with nary an appealing bone in her body. She's rude, crude, shallow and completely unlikeable. Her family is a pathetic caricature of 'power' and 'respect' -- I thought by the end of this 'novel' (hah) we would get a lesson in the dangers of superficiality so severe that members of said family are named after expensive cars, but alas, this was not the case. I'm not sure what Ms. Souljah is trying to do. I found this book completely pointless and offensive. Maybe next time this author develops a yearning to titillate herself with materialistic fantasies, she could try for her own show on BET."
2,A Disapponting Book,"'The Coldest Winter Ever' by Sista Souljah was very, very disappointing. On the heels of her book 'No Disrespect', I would have thought that she came with a better showing than this.For some reason she tries to incorporate every urban cliche and stereotype known to man. The way Winter was a fiend for the latest designer clothes and money, to these elaborate hustles and schemes she was always cooking up or to some girls carrying razor blades in their mouth. Never do any of her characters have moments of reflection or recollection about life. I have been around that culture in the same borough that the book is set in and Souljah's view is nowhere near to reality.All in all, a not-so-well written book."
4,Dynamic,"This book was dynamic to say the least. I enjoyed the trials and tribulations that Winter faced which made the book even better. It is sad to say but this is what goes on in our urban communities with people living the good life off the oppression of a certain people in this case african american. I gave this book 4 stars and the reason why I gave 4 and not 5 is because I wasn't too keen on the way the book ended. I felt like due to the brutal reality this book brought there should have been a positive aspect as well. Being a person raised in this type of environment I know there are people who overcome these obstacles and become productive members of society.In conclusion this is a book that I would strongly recommend. I can also say once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down, its like looking at a movie but what makes it even better you can cast your own actors or actresses for who you see fit to be each character."
5,Best Book ever,The coldest winter ever was maybe the best book Sister Souljah could have ever written.It tells you about a young african american girl who goes through a lot in order to servive. Born and raised in the ghetto Winters father is the top drug dealer who's operation gets busted. So winter and her mom and 3 sisters are out of a home and money. Winter is a hot girl who loves men and sex.She is very atractive so all of the men want her and she just really gets them for their money.There's more to the story but you should read to find out more.I think that Sister Souljah really out did her self and even though I don't know her I'm proud of her
5,Off tha Hook,"This book was excellent. Souljah's imagination is off the hook. This was the one book I read 5 years ago that made me become an avid reader of African American fiction, before this I had no real interest."
4,banging,Man this book was all that plus a put of chicken gizzerts if you'll know what I am talking about. I can't wait until sista soujah comes out with her next joint. Child hurry up...
3,Interesting Read,"I must applaud Sister Souljah for her first novel. With the way this was written, it appears she has a good future as a novelist. I give this book three stars because I felt that the characters could have been more well rounded and true lessons could have been learned by some of the characters. Their was not one redeeming character that had a major storyline in the book and the only person that straightened themselves out was connected, in a particular manner, to Sister Souljah. I found that a little egotistical but I still give props to Sister Souljah for doing her thing."
5,The Best Book Ever!,I loved this book and I think that everyone who enjoys literature about Urban society and it's goings on should read it.The tone of the book is so real. You could just imagine that these characters are real and even at the end you still want to know what is going to happen to them on a day to day basis. This book is very engrossing. Don't start this unless you have 24 hours of leisure time to read. Once you start you won't want to put it down!
4,Sometimes life ends a little bogus,This book was real good. The one thing I didn't like was how the book ended. Winter spent her whole life getting money and living large. Her whole life came to a stand still when her father was arrested and sent to jail. She had to learn things on her own after that. Over all this is a good book to read because some of the stuff is probably happening to someone you know or even yourself.by Yashida B.
3,A fast read but just awright,"I sped through this because this woman knows how to tell a story. But, whatever she writes, she doesn't come across as a teacher or a guide but as a preacher and this book was another chance to get on her soapbox. Souljah is hardly a master of words but she is apt at conveying feelings, which is what makes this book worth the time."
5,ON POINT--A NEW TWIST ON A OLD FORMULA,"THE COLDEST WINTER EVER gave me a different view on the old rags to riches formula by introducing Winter. A young lady who already has everything and lose it all by letting her selfish wants overide her need to have a soul. The fact that her wealth is contributed to her father's illegal activitites and she considers it a blessing as she happily spends her fathers money without realizing his destructive nature made the book even more appealing. I've never read anything like it before and I truly hope that Sister Souljah creates a sequel to Winter's story. Maybe with a early parole for good behavior, Winter story can begin again, this time, with her sister, who seems to be following in the same footsteps. THINK ABOUT IT, S.S.!"
5,Don't Sleep On This One,"Great book. This was a well written, intriguing story. My friends kept telling me this book was good, but I didn't believe them. I bought the book and added it to my collection where it sat for over three years. When I finally got around to reading it, I was hooked starting on page one. This book was the bomb and was better than I expected. I've read it a second time and enjoyed it just like the first time. I can't believe I slept on this one it was awesome"
5,Great Book!,"If you are into black authors/novels you will love this book. When you read this book the main character Winter gives you a step by step tour of her life from drug dealers, and jail to girl fights in the streets. I was given this book in college, and read it in 2 days (between classes). I gave this book to someone as a gift and they loved it too! Sister Souljah does a great job...you just have to read it for yourself b/c explaining does the book no justice!!"
5,The Coldest Winter,"Yes this was a good book. I was told by plenty of people to read this book and I am glad that I did. This book caught my interest from the begining. Winter was a strong, smart, snicky gril. Her girl friends were the same. I feel that this book took my interest because I was just waiting for more to happen. This girl and her family went through a lot of stuff and Winter showed the people around her that she could survive."
5,definitely a good read!!!,"My friend told me about this book one day, and I sort of just was like yeah ,ok ,whatever. The following week I turn around, and my cousin's got it up to her nose, so I thought ...let me see what all the reading is about. And so I did.I thought this book was very well written. The fact that you can identify with the main character draws you to every word on the page. Regardless of how she ends up, I think Winter was very articulate in her decision making and survival skills. However like most good books there is always a few chapters you can do without, and as far as this read goes, the part where sister souljah writes herself into the plot. We didn't need it, nevertheless, I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it."
5,THE BEST ACTION PACKED BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ,"The first thing that I have to say is that this book started me on the road to reading. I realized how interesting reading could be.By just browsing throw the book at a friends house, I was so drown that I bought it the next day. I was so into the book that I would sneak to read it in class. I could not put the book down, no part of the book was ever boaring. The book was so interesting that it never left you thinking if I get past this boring chapter then it would come to the juicy parts again.The whole book left me in suspence. It also left me with different fillings and emotions just like I was a character in the book."
4,The Coldest Winter Ever,"All I can say is .....You have got to read this book. Once you open it you wont put it down. The book was so good, every light I came to in my car I was reading. You definitely wont want it to end. Real tear jerker at the end."
5,WOW,"I am not much of a Sister Souljah fan, and was shocked to see that she had written a fiction novel. HOWEVER, this book was one of the best contemporary books I've read--period. Sister Souljah leaves her self-righteousness out of this one, and writes a damn good novel. I finished it in two days and could barely keep it closed. This is a highly recommended read, and I hope the film does it justice, because it is a must-read for sisters everywhere. I'm keeping my fingers crossed in anticipation that Sister Souljah continues writing fiction-she is truly gifted!"
5,DEFINITELY SLAMMIN'!,"THIS BOOK WAS ""OFF THE HOOK!"" SISTER SOULJAH WROTE THIS BOOK SO ELOQUENTLY THAT I FELT LIKE I WAS SITTING ON WINTER SANTIAGA'S SHOULDER THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THING! IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE NOVELS THAT YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN. THE EVENTS AND THE CHARACTERS WERE SO REAL! ALL I KNOW IS THIS: WHATEVER ELSE SISTER SOULJAH PENS, IS ALREADY BOUGHT!"
3,Left a lot of questions,"Im sorry I have to disagree with all the great reviews. The story left many unanswered questions. Some of the characters were not well developed at all. The worst part of the story had to be the shameless self promotion of the author, that was unforgivable. She could have had a character like herself but to use yourself in your own book comes off a little arrogant. She left to many stories unfinished and never explained what happen to several characters. The story itself was good and was not boring but she should work on character development in her future novels and tie up loose endings. Also I hope she does not get stuck in just writing ghetto fabulous stories, there is so much more and she does have great potential. Im hoping that her next novel will be much better."
5,That's a Wrap!,"I must say that I was reluctant to read this book, however, once I started, I couldn't put it down. The Coldest Winter Ever is an excellent drama that deals with the life and times of Winter Santiago and her family, which happens to be in the drug arena. It also hinges on a subject that I feel is very important - mandatory minimum drug laws. Winter is a 17 year old going on 27. Sister Souljah did a great job with her characterization of all that played a role in Winter's life. The storyline was very realistic and is actually the story of alot of young African-Americans today.It's movie material... Winter - Tatiana Ali; Chili of TLC; or Maia Campbell from In the House; Santiago - Ron O'Neal; ""Mom"" Santiago - Pam Grier; Midnight - Morris Chestnut Sister Souljah - Sister Souljah herself, or Queen Latifah."
5,The Coldest Winter Ever was HOTTTTT!!,"Hats off to Sister Souljah!! The pages on this novel turned so fast, I had to read the book twice. Not a day goes by that I don't see Winter, she lives in so many women. This novel was sooo exceptional that my sisters and I manage to talk talk about the book on a weekly basis. Something just always seems to remind us of the coldest winter ever. This is a must read for all!!! Souljah, PLEASE WRITE MORE! Now, for anyone contemplating reding this novel, DON'T, just set aside an afternoon, and read away. THIS BOOK WAS FANTABULOUS"
5,Can You Get Through This Winter?,"If you haven't read this you're missing out on one of the most intense portrayal of a life that most of use no nothing about. When I read this book I could smell the smells of Brooklyn. I know the people Winter knows, I sense her anger and I cry her tears....You will too. Read this book and see if you could survive The Coldest Winter Ever."
2,Wow,I remember reading this book when I was younger but as an adult I couldn't finish it but its great to have in my collectin
4,Hooked,I just recently read this book after a few friends of mine said it was a must read. I have to say I read this book in 2 sittings and was pleased from the begginning to the end.
3,Good read,"Well can't complain about the book. At first I was not into it but once I continued reading I was not able to put it down, what I would say Winter was a smart young lady for certain thing, for the important stuff she was very native or better said she thought about herself. I guess her daddy never thought her about what goes around comes around.. The reason why I gave it only 3stars was the concept of the book is good have read before but at the end of the day if you want a realistic story you look at your life when you read a fiction book you want a fiction answer some good new at the end not an uncertain story answer that leave you with more answer that when you were reading the story."
3,NO FRONT COVER,"I am very disappointed on how my front cover of the Coldest Winter Ever did not download to my kindle. The book itself was downloaded but not the front cover. ""Very disappointed about this""."
3,Winters a Trip!,"I know I'm late, but I just read this book, and I guess I'll write a review. I thought this book had its good points, and overall the story moves nice, but it had some bad points too, so I could only give it three stars. As far as the good points, the sexual scenes were good, and like the way the author narrated the story. The bad points would be how stupid the main character was. She wasn't smart at all, and it was hard for me to root for her. Plus I think the book wasn't that polished, but overall it was a good read, and I would recommend it."
4,Almost the best,I liked this book a lot and I'm looking forward to the movie but I was disapointed in the ending. It seemed as is she got too anctious with finishing the book an rushed it. Every thing else in the book was good. It was all exciting and kept you captivated. The cruddyness was all too believable. When I first got the book I had only read one E. Lynn Harris and was kind of wierded out by black authors at that point but this book reintroduced me to black litirature. Now im first in line to get books by Eric Jerome Dickey and others(no more E.Lynn Harris). I recomend this book to anyone wanting to get an excellent read Look for the movie.
5,No Doubt The Best!!,"This book demonstrates the life of a teenage girl who is the product of a broken home. She suddenly has to become a women at a moments notice. She's smart, witty, sexy, and vindicitive all rolled into one. This is a MUST reader for all high school students. (Parents you can read too!!)I really enjoyed this book, because it showed me the ways of life that I could never imagine. I took me only 2 days to read and could not put it down until the last page was read."
5,"""The Coldest Winter Ever""by Sista Souljah","This book is...great. Sista Souljah made a book for someone who can relate to the characters experiences. ""The Coldest Winter Ever"" has a storyline about a teenager growing into a women and is going to many problems that actually caught my attention alot. It's not very appropriate for teens, but many teens nowadays may have gone through what the the main character has. This book has suspense and the author did a good job at foreshadowing through the story to make the reader unable to put the book down. This book is ready for a sequel. I felt that the character was someone I knew made a good moral to the story. It makes you think about your own life and experiences even if they haven't been as suspenseful.Sista Souljah brought interesting characters that helped with making this book so good.This book is good for even the laziest readers. It's especially excellent for those avid readers. It'll be even a bigger treat!"
5,GREAT BOOK,"The book it self is great, outstanding and so much more. I just hated the ending.I couldn't put it down. Two nights in a row I fell asleep with the book in my hand. I couldn't put it down."
5,"The Coldest Winter Ever, a great novel","What would you do if everything you had was just taken from you? Everything, your house, your cars, your family, everything, just gone. That's how life is right now for Winter Santiaga. When her father, a drug czar and felonious criminal, Santiaga is busted. The cops come and take everything from the million dollar mansion, to their luxurious cars, even their family was split, now life is a problem for all of them. Now, in order to make a living and stay away from a girl's home, Winter must do everything in her will. She evn begins to date a criminal such as her father. Then, he gets busted, but who gets blamed? Will her father remain in prison? Where does her life go from there? Read the book, you'll love it and find out everyhing else that went unmentioned. Its worth your time and you won't want to put it down. I gave this book a top rating because that's just how good I thought it was. Read this book, you'll love it."
5,The Coldest Winter Ever,Sister Souljah I must say I've never read a book like this one before and I must say it is one of the best books I've read in a long time.Winter is so real and the rest of the characters just fall right into place. This book really has me at a loss for words. I must say you put your heart into this book and gave your complete all. Keep up the good work.
4,Loved this book!,"I read this book and like many of these reviewers, I couldn't put it down. At times I liked Winter, I hated her and felt sorry for her. And this is what you see everyday, women using their body to get what they want, money, clothes, etc.. Without giving away the book, Winter is just like what the title says ""COLD"".I do have to comment on Sister Souljah's description of herself in this book, I guess she is making fun of herself or downplaying her image. She calls herself outdated (in so many words), overweight, etc, etc. I guess she did that to prove a point, that most young girls don't have a positive role model in their lives and when someone tries to help and guide them, they act like they don't need any help.I would like to see a sequel to this book, or better yet, write another one close to it!"
5,The way of life,"Well I think that this was the best book ever because sister souljah was keepin it real when she wrote this book. This book touches everyday problems like, drugs and, relationship problems, family problems &etc. This book is definitely my favorite, and I would love to read a part two. I don't like to read but I read this book in 10 hours or less, it is just that good. So recommend everyone to read this book at least once."
3,The Coldest Winter.,"This book is not at all what I would call an interesting read. I wouldn't call it an accurate description of urban life and culture although the author claims it is. Also there are many questions left unanswered. Only 80% of it is the book, the other 20% is Q%A and other such essays telling you what you were supposed to get from it. That to me means the book wasn't well written."
4,Great Story!,"I read the Coldest Winter Ever and felt that it was a powerful book with a subtle message to those young people out there who feel that getting money the EASY way is not necessarily a good thing. I feel that the main character Winter went through quite a few emotionally disturbing events but never quite got in touch with her feelings or learned any valuable lesson from them. I can not say that I was in love with the main character, but felt her downfall is necessary in order to convey the message. I was much more interested in the character of Midnight, who seemed to have his head squarely on his shoulders.Overall this book is a magnificent one for conveying a powerful message to today's youth. Money isn't everything!"
5,PRAISE TO YOU SISTA SOULJAH!!!!!!!,I first read this book over 10 years ago and I must say of all the books I have read since then this is still one of my top five books of all time!!! If you have not read this book order it and when it comes take that day for yourself because you will need it because you will not want to put it down!!!1
3,a message to the people,"sister souljah has done it again. a successful and thought provoking book while entertaining at the same time. the story is not an new one just done a little differently. souljah wants african, latin and people of color to get it that teenage parenting, absentee fathers and thug life is not benefical to individuals or our communities."
5,I COULDN'T STOP READING,"I feel so bad. I was teaching at school and while the kids had rest time, I continued to read the book. Rest time is only 30 minutes, but an hour later, I looked up and realized that I was deep into the book. It is going to many girls for Xmas this year."
3,good book,"i haven't read it in years, but remember that it was a good book. well written and kept you reading."
5,Cold,"Needed to be aware of the struggle that young women go through to stay beautiful. So lets keep it moving forward,and not be like Winter. I know in my heart that life will end and begin as soon as you open your eyes. Her life never had a chance."
5,1 of the Best,one of the best book i have ever read. i read this over four times i could never get board with this book
5,Keepin' It Real,"The Clodest Winter Ever was an insightful book that kept you reading. It was recomended to me by a couple of my friends and I am indeed grateful for the suggestion. It painted a vivid portrait of the street life so many of us can relate to. That the shiny most expensive things are all that is important in this life. And to obtain those things reguardless who we hurt or endager, some will go to any lenghts. I found my self wanting to be Winter's friend to show her there's more to life. To Winter's simple minded circle of friends she was someone to look up to. But, to the everyday person with common sense she was someone to pity. This story mad me sad only because it was such a realistic story that I see everyday. But, in he same breath I am relieved to see that others share my sarrow. I appriciate Soulja for using her gift to shed some light and try her best to reach out and help these lost souls! BIG UP TO BROOKLYN,"
5,Winter gave me chills,"This book was recommended to me by a close friend who doesn't read nearly as much as I do. She told me that it was so good she couldn't put it down. I read the book and found myself sneaking in the bathroom at work just to get through two or three chapters. The book was so real and so explicit, that I actually thought I knew each character personally. Everyone knows a Winter or a Santiago. It made me take a look at my own life and the things that I put a great emphasis on. The book was good from the first chapter to the end. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a reality check. This is definitely one for the big screen."
5,THE COLDEST WINTER EVER/AUTHOR SISTER SOULJAH,I LOVE THIS BOOK/I LOVE THE PEOPLE SHE CREATED/THIS BOOK NEVER GOT BORING ONE TIME.THE BOOK WAS A FAST READ YOU CAN READ IN ONE DAY AND THATS NO JOKE/THIS BOOK WILL FEEL LIKE SOME EVERYDAY LIFE OR CAN RELATE SOME HOW/EXCELLENT BOOK/SISTER SOULJAH NEED A MOVIE AND NEED A PART TWO.
1,Off the Chain (5 STARS),"This book was so riveting that I finished it in approximately five hours (11pm to 3:30am), could barely get up for work the next morning; it was very interesting, enlightening and empowering. Interesting because it depicts what really goes on in the hood; enlightening and inspiring because it details the road of destruction and encourages me to continue on fighting the temptation of the fast life and the lust for the strength of those type of men, I'm like a magnet to them; which has been an off and on situation in my life but my prayers have kept me safe; it is a warning for black men and women to stay out of the game; it's an addiction, a fast life that ends fast"
1,not my cup of tea,"this book was so highly recommended to me, but i was disappointedcouldn't get past first few pages, put it down and tried again . found b-more careful to much more interesting perhaps because i am from baltimore and it was nice to be able to read about my city even in a bad light. have tried to read other of her writings just don't find her to my taste. but then again i don't usually read books of this genre"
4,This was a great book!!,I did not know much about Sister Souljah before I read this book. I am very impressed by her philosophy and her writings. Winter was so real to me that it was scary. It makes me sad to think about all of the young women out there that think and feel the same way as Winter. My 15-year-old daughter read the book and she also feels that Winter wasted her life and could have learned a lot from Sister Souljah.
5,Hottest Writer Ever,"As a newcomer to Sister Souljah's literature and style, I am estatic to see the queen of hard knocks back at her finest. Her work is beautiful, this I first experienced after reading No Disrespect, another epic work of the Souljah. Which is by the way, my most favorite book of all time. This book I feel will not only be a musy-read but a must-have also...one of the books like my mom would describe to be ""...a book to read over and over again..."" Sister Souljah provides me with some of the most realest words I've ever heard. Her words flow like a song so her literature feels and sounds like lyrics to beautiful, hard-spoken poetry. Her work is an inspiration for I am an aspiring writer myself. It helps me to erase all fears to tell it like it is in my work. Afro Lit is beautiful. Holla @ me if you want to chat...Check my email..."
5,This book will blow your mind,"Winter and all the Winter's of the world - Life is too short.Sistah Souljah really put her foot in this one. This book was one of my top ten to read, making somewhere between 1 and 5. Ghetto and hood rich Winter wanted everything her way, wanted all the nice things and would not settle for less. I commend her on that but what I did not like about her was the fact that she used sex as a weapon and in the end, it came back to haunt her.Great book for every female ages 13 thru 35 to read and pass down as a gift each and every female in your life."
4,ENJOYABLE READ,"THIS WAS A PLEASANT READ, THE WRITING WAS DETAILED ANDVERY UNDERSTANDING. THIS IS THE WEALTHY LIFESTYLE THAT PEOPLE WISH THEY HAD BUT WITH THE WRONG ENDING. THIS BOOK IS A GREAT READ FOR YOUNG ADULTS THAT NEED A LITTLE GUIDANCE."
5,The reality of the streets,"This book was greatly written. From the vivid descriptions of the streets of Brooklyn, you see yourself and the people all right there. The end of the book brought tears to my eyes. It was at those moments that you see the main character Winter in the state of mind that she should have been her whole life. This book is a must read for anyone that thinks that the hustle is worth it, especially for there man. This book shows that your life, and future is more precious than any man, designer dress, or bling bling !!!!"
5,The coldest Winter ever,"The coldest Winter ever is a great book. I enjoy it so much I read it twice. I told all my friends that they must read this book. The chacters was so real, it was like I really knew them. Sister Souljah is a wonderful writer. Please hurry with another book!"
5,the best book i ever read,"WHILE AT MY DESK MY FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT THIS BOOK BUT I WAS NOT THAT INTO IT BUT I STARTED READING IT BECAUSE I WAS BORED AND BEFORE I KNEW IT I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. AS I WAS READING IT I BECAME TO KNOW WINTER AND FELT HER UPS AND DOWNS AND I ALSO FELT AS IF SHE WAS A REAL PERSON. I WOULD EVEN PUT MY CUSTOMERS ON HOLD BECAUSE THEY CALLED AT THE BEST PARTS IN THE BOOK. I EVEN GOT INTO PULLING MATCHES WITH MY FRIEND OVER THE BOOK I WAS SO DETERMINED TO FINISH THE BOOK I STAYED UP TIL 3AM TRYING TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT. BY THE TIME I FINISHED THE BOOK WINTER'S NAME WAS ALL OVER MY JOB AND PEOPLE WERE CALLING ME SAYING WHAT HAPPEN? WHAT DID WINTER DO? IT WAS LIKE WE KNEW HER AND SHE WAS FROM OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. SIS SOULJAH GOD HAS BLESSED YOU WITH A WONDERFUL GIFT THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT WITH THE WORLD MAY GOD BLESS AND KEEP YOU. MY NEXT BOOK WILL BE ""NO DISRESPECT"""
5,"BRAVO, Sister Souljah...BRAVO!","This book was great, and an incredibly fast read. I enjoyed the characters and was constantly surprised by the way some of them were able to ""rise"" (for lack of a better term), while others took a long hard fall. The ending, takes a few very unexpected twists and turns, which I think is what made me enjoy the book even more. I completely expected it to go in one direction, and Sister Souljah took it in the complete opposite. Well done!"
5,21st Century,"When The Coldest Winter Ever was assigned I thought that it would be boring. But this was the best book I've read in a long time. Sister Souljah really got deep with today's society in this book. I read this book in 1 day because I wasn't able to put it down. To instrested in what Winter would try to do next to keep her status she was accustom too. Alot of people wanted the book to end differently but I enjoyed it, because it shows you that what goes up will come down hard. That's what happened with Santiaga,Winter and her Friends......."
2,Cold Alright,"Like most books written for African American women, I found this one to lack substance. I thought that this book was a good read until Winter met with Sister Souljah. That was the ultimate act of narcissism. The book lost my interest there. I would recommend that young women who are fascinated by the easy life read it. It was scary how easy it was for Winter to have her whole life turned upside down in an instant."
1,HORRIBLE!,"So after years of being told how great this book was, I finally borrowed it from a friend. Big mistake!!! This has to be one of, if not THE worst book I've ever read. When I was done, I scratched my head thinking, this cannot be the same book everyone raved about. I wanted to throw it down after just a few chapters but kept reading thinking it would get better... it didn't. There was no growth at all in Winter; she was the same dummy from beginning to the end. I made myself finish, thinking it would get better but it never did. I was left wondering if I actually read the wrong book. I even went back to 3 different people that told me this book was 'excellent' and asked what they thought was excellent about it... blank stares; no one really could answer. They had all read the book 10yrs ago and couldn't remember anything about it. I would suggest re-reading this book now that they're all over 30 and rate it again, but in my opinion, that would just be plain torture."
3,THROWBACK,pepole made this book to be the GREATEST BOOK AKA A MUST READ..SO I'MMA BE COMPLETEY HONEST WITH PEPOLE WHO HAVE NEVER EVER READ THIS BOOK..THE BOOK STARTED OF GOOD..BUT THEN TOWARDS THE END BECAME VERY BORINGAND AT THE END THE BOOK BECAME VEY PREDICTABLEI READ THE BOOK AGAIN AND THE BOOK STILL WASNT ALL THAT GOOD..HOW THEY DID HER MOTHER.. AND PLAYED HER FATHER OUT LIKE THATAND HOW MIDNIGHT NEVER REALLY HAD INTERSET I HER...TYPICAL
4,i dont see what the big deal is,"maybe reading flyy girl first, this book didnt really do it for me. everyone is fascinated like, ooh did you read this and read that. it was very good though. her mother had her when she was 14. i can hardly get over that. anyway its about how she lived a pretty good life. her father was a drug lord then something happened and he ends up in jail, her mother becomes a crack head and she goes from the top to the bottom, climbing her way back to the top then gettin put back in jail. althought this book didnt really do it for me, it was good. i know that probably doesnt make sense. she got by, regardless of what situation she was put in. so i recommend reading this book, you were anyway. :)"
5,"Bad Title, EXCELLENT Book",I'm not a fan of long titles but maybe that's meThe imagery was amazing and as a former Brooklyn-ite I can attest to its accuracy.I love that there was a message; despite how we felt for the heroine (and heroes) the message is very clear.Fiction and fact all rolled into a lovely story
1,I am surprised and confused by all the Rave reviews,"for this book. First let me say I purchased this book based on every ones rave reviews and never bothered to read the synopsis,stupid of me I know. Well, what a waste of time and money, I couldn't even get past the 2nd/ 3rd pages because the subject/content and language used in the book is so stereotypical and juvenile and childish. I really wanted to give it a try but, the abundance of slang used is overwhelming it's like every sentence I am having to decode what a phrase of slang means.Sorry, this book is not my cup of tea. I want a refund of my money and time."
2,I Don't Think So!!!!,This was not the best book ever! I was so disappointed. I thought the book was based on Sistah Soldier and not Winter. The book did have some good parts. This would not be a book I would read again! I just want to know why did the author have to write herself into the story. I guess just to give herself props! I finished the book hoping it was going to get better. At the end it did show what happens when a person is trying to be with drug dealers all the time.
5,A MUST READ STORY,This was ONE of the best books I've read In a long time....WINTER WAS MONEY HUNGARY AND NEVER WANTED TO WORK FOR IT.....THE LESSON SHE LEARNED WILL BE WITH HER FOR A LIFETIME....TALK ABOUT FOLLOWING IN YOUR FATHERS FOOTSTEPS.....SHE JUMPED RIGHT IN IT
5,BEST BOOK EVER,I think the sister Souljgh book was fantastic. I really enjoyed reading this book if i had a chance i would read it again. this is a tough story. this was a book that really interested me. this is a book that i have to just keep recommanding to many others. I'm sure that i have told many people to read this book. Many people told me that they have heard about this book but had neva read the book. i told many people to go and find a library and see whether they have this book. finally if anyone asked me about this book i would tell them to read it.
5,read this book several times,"I have read this book several times since it was introduced to me a few years ago and enjoy it every time. I've lent it to several friends who have all enjoyed it. Wouldn't go as far as to say that its the best book ever written, but I can't think of many that I liked more."
2,Seriously?,"This book has been hyped up for years, so I finally getting around to reading it. This book was horrible,if Sister Souljah can be a writer, than I should be President. I found it amazing how Winter's only concern was her FATHER, SEX and MONEY; what about her mother and her sisters? Immature garbage story. The whole thing was just horrible. I want my money back!"
2,The Dumbest Winter Ever Left Me Hanging,"This book was very compelling, but I was very disappointed by the ending. I couldn't identify with Winter at all, even though I know many people like her. I hated her. All she cared about was ice and men and wearing name brands. She is one of the most superficial protagonists! I kept waiting for her to turn her life around, to realize how utterly STUPID she is for only caring about the BLING BLING and sex and looking good. But she never did. And what is up with Sister Souljah incorporating her own image into the novel? I thought that was a bit pompous. I kept waiting for Midnight to come and help Winter. Somebody needed to help the poor child. Maybe I just wanted a fairy tale ending. Even at the very bitter end, Winter still only cares about how good she looks compared to others. You'd think after all she had been through, she would have learned her lesson. I wouldn't be surprised if she would be back to her old tricks. There was no real resolution.:("
1,Disappointing,There was a lot of hype about this book and that is why I purchased it. Through the years I have heard it was a great book. As I read it I found myself wanting to throw the book away. I found the writing to be mediocre and the topic to be very challenging to believe it was reality. After I finished the book I desperately want my money back and the time I wasted reading it.
5,Great book to read!,"This book is off the hook!Sister Souljah's unique writting will make you feel what her characters go through.Every time I recommend this book to somebody, they can not put it down.Excellent!!!"
1,Waste of time!!!,"Nearly everyone I came in contact with had nothing but good things to say about Sister Souljah's fiction attempt... Notice Isaid attempt. If this is the best book you ever read...You haven't read many books. This book isn't about the journey, but the destination. And let me just say the ride there is boring, predictable, and trite. Souljah doesn't consider language, depth of characters, or universality. If you want a novel that is not written well that's filled with gratuitist explentives. Then this, my friend is the novel for you."
4,You think thid was a cold winter?,"I love her Brooklyn bad bitch attitude. How no one got in her way, she knew who she was and her streets smarts, got her around. I also loved how Souljah got in deep with the main character Winter. If you like the whole ""ghetto"" drug, money and violence, a long with families falling apart, And how a father can't be around to help out his family."
5,Feel the project life of Winter,"This book really caught my attention, it trully depicted project life. I read it in two days. I stayed up late and woke up at five in the morning to finish. I couldn't wait to read more about Winter's journey. This book could enlighten several individuals who think there is a future in the drug game."
5,UNVALUABLE MONEY,"This Book, if you start reading it , you won't stop until you have read the complete book. It' s so interesting to know how one person could let theirs wants change them into someone they are not.Take a lesson from this, its very , very good. Being Bully don't pay off and remember to earn money the honest way."
5,Bringing Heat To The Coldest Winter Ever,"Like many, the novel came recommended. I had some reservations since I didn't expect a creative tale from a great political activist like Souljah. My bad. To put it simply, this was the best novel I've read in years. Her ability to lay out a tale of a familiar 'sistah' we can all identify with from the hood, like Winter, was exceptional. Souljah's additional ability to provide a well, thought-out story involving an array of intriguing characters, plots and sub-plots and a sequence of twists to the very end add up to a classic African-American novel that will endure the test of time. After completing this book, I had to buck convention and send Sister Souljah an email of admiration for her work. I hope she can find the time and energy to generate another tale that speaks to the interests, experiences and values of African-Americans. Much love, Sister Souljah."
3,The Winter Ever,"The Coldest Winter Ever, Wow. This was a good read other than Winter's fetish for clothes, hair, cars and money. Another thing that made me ? the book was Sister Souljah's cameo in the book. What was her porpose of being in the story."
2,Lots of Hipe but Rather Disappointing... I feel cheated!,"By now, this book has compensated the author well, but it is not worth the purchase price that I paid for the ebook version. At 82% into the book, the author goes into this Q&A section about the book when we should have been reading 18% more about closure on the characters of the story. There was way too much explanation and justication about the author than necessary. She could have added much of this information to a blog or something similar. I feel cheated!"
5,Wheres da movie at,this is the best book i ever read i read it in 3 days i couldnt put the book down.its about this girl named winter n her dad is a top drug dealer livin in brooklyn and she always got all the finer things in life but then her dad gets caught and she has to try n survive on her own.Its a real good book. Please read it!
3,Not what everybody makes it to be,"This book was so good the first couple chapters then after that I just skipped it...talking to much about sister soulja and she left out so many details like seriously it was nothing like dirty red that book was so true like a soap opera the author kept you going on the edge of your seat I like books that each page is interesting so good I'm reading the number on the bottom of the page too just so I don't miss anything (lol) but this book had to many gaps like when winter stole the money or when her mama got on drugs how it started, i mean i haven't read in over 6months but it left out a lot of details and a lot of doors was left open with your mind wondering.I definately would not read this again but I still would recommend it to young readers its a good book just little sloppy!"
5,SURE IS COLD,"Winter was named well because she is madd cold. When u get to the end of the book you're like ""Damn, that is madd cold"" (or should i say hot?) Well, n-e-wayz it's about a young girl and i say young b'cuz of her 'the world evolves around me' attitude, that learns life is not gurantee to be nice and goes from being queen of the world to the bottom of someone shoe. Don't get me wrong though cuz this book iz MADD GOOD and believe me you won't put in down until the very end. I hope there's a sequence to this! I would love to tell u more but i'm afraid i get carried away and will keep writing. After u read this book tell me what u think!"
2,Classic? Brilliant? Not so much...,"Mmm...maybe I'll need to read this one again, because I didn't see what was so brillant about it. I've also read Midnight, which is supposed to be the prequel to this book, and I enjoyed it much more. There wasn't anything riveting about this and I didn't really like Winter Santiaga as a character. I thought she was self-centered and dishonest."
5,OFF THA HOOK!!!!,"Man, this book was soooooo good! ...Now, normally, I wouldn't really think about reading a book as long as this one, but I heard so much good stuff about it that I had to tell my mother to buy it. I opened the book up on a Saturady and finished it by Sunday. It was fantastic. I really felt the connection between me and Winter. The book was just so easy to relate to! This book is definetely my all time favorite. I hated to finish reading it, I just wish it would have gone on and on. I love that book to death!! I give 50 thumbs up to Sister Souljah......Girl, you got it goin' on!!!!!"
5,Mesmerizing!,I read Winter sometime last year and loved it. My whole life revolved around this book! If I could have read this in my car I would have! I read it slowly because I didn't want it to end. That's how hooked I was. I read at least 50 or more books a year and so far this is still the most incredible book I've read. . . EVER! I told all my friends to stop reading whatever they were into at the time and pick up The Coldest Winter Ever. Its one of the few books that I feel everyone should read. Young people who think the drug life is glamourous could definitely benefit from this novel. I really would love to see this made into a movie and I hope Sister Souljah writes something else soon. She definitely has the gift!
3,Good in a lot of places,"[..]It's interesting, the story linked above is my work of fiction that was in part inspired by this book but that doesn't mean I think that the book is perfect. The aggression and determination is pretty inspiring, but her word choices and phrasing in a lot of it leave something to be desired. In addition it felt like there weren't clear directions for some parts of the book as they related to an overall outline. That means that your attention ebbs and flows in certain parts instead of being held throughout. Still, very much worth reading."
4,Great read- I wish it didnt end!,"This is a GREAT book! This is the only book I have read by Sister Souljah, I am hooked! I cant wait to get lost in another one of her books!Read this and you will be hooked too! Enjoy!"
4,A Classic,"I love this book ever since I read it in high school.I could never get tired of this book, I wanna know when the movie is coming out, because there really needs to be a movie for this book ASAP"
1,Sloppy,This is the worst book I had to read in college. The author writes like a teenager and paints a story thats hardly believable. Terrible dialogue and unrealistic circumstances. Hard to relate to as well. Skip this one
5,OHMIGOD...have I finished reading the book already!,"More, more more, Sister Souljah! I never wanted this book to end! Sister Souljah has done it again. Her first book, No Disrespect was a great read and I was thrilled to see that Souljah has only gotten better with time. I quickly absorbed each page, the characters are well-developed, the story is wonderfully unpredictable and unfolds at an incredibly well-written pace. What a nail-biter! I couldn't read fast enough. I was reading everywhere I went and everytime I had a quiet moment. I hated to put the book down. I found myself longing for more at the end and thinking about the characters well after the book was finished. Hope to see a follow-up second book to this saga Sister Souljah. I'm begging for more!"
3,Wasn't Sure How To Rate This Book,"You ever read a book and when you're done, you just can't let the characters go? I finished reading Sister Souljah latest, and the characters just won't leave me alone. Maybe that's a sign of a well written story is the fact that you just can't shake it. I didn't think it would affect me THIS much."
5,THE WARMTH OF READING...,THIS BOOK WAS EXCELLENT. THANK'S TO SOULJAH FOR SUCH AN AWESOME ENTRY INTO THE LITERARY ARENA. I'M ANXIOUSLY AWAITING HER NEXT NOVEL.
5,da greatest book eva,i picked this book up from the book store by accident i saw the cover and it intrigued me i wasn't sure wat made me purchase the book but something about it made me wanna read it after reading the first page i didn't wanna put it down the book was so intense and kept me on my toes at all times with each page i fell in love with the charcters and felt like i cud relate to the things they went through this book should not be past by it's a must read i've read it numerous times already i have recommended this book to many people and they share my love for this book sista souljah is truely a talented individual recommened every1 read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,okay,it was okay but it was some time confusing but it was overalla good story and now you can learn from someones else wrong doing instead of going through the same thing winter did.
4,Gotta love the drama,This book was GREAT!! I loved it and stayed up all night just to finish. Winter's story was full of DRAMA and I ate it all up. Sister Souljah had a few unrealistic parts and I did not like how she glued herself into the book. My mother did not like it very well but for young adult crowd (under 30) you cannot go wrong. I cannot wait for another one by this great author.
5,one of the best and most exciting books I ever read.......,"The coldest winter ever is simply one of the best books i ever read. I emensely enjoyed this book. The coldest winter ever is a very realistic portaryl of street, drug and hood life, i have ever read. The book has a postive theme through out the story. The audience gets to see winter's struggles as she tries to recreate her childhood life style. she is in seach of all the comforts that drug money once brought her. Winters journey puts her in one bad sitution after another, all of which plays a emense role in the shape of her future. I don't want to say any more i just want you to read the book."
2,Cold doesnt describe the feeling I got!,"The moral of the story was good, but Winter was just to ignorant for me. I dont like the ignorance of her throughout the book."
1,One of the best books I have ever read.,I truly enjoyed this book. This book took control of my mind while I was reading it. Its very hard to find a book that does that. Im not familar with the lifestyle that the characters were living but the author did a wonderful job of placing me right there. Sister Souljah is a wonderful author. JOB WELL DONE.
1,THIS BOOK WAS COLD,THIS BOOK WAS SO UN BELIVEABLE HOW R U RAISED BY A KING PIN AND DON'T KNOW U DON'T SIT IN A CAR WITH DRUGS IN IT NO MATTER HOW BAD U WANT TO GET PAID I WAS BORED I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO FINSIH READING THIS BOOK BUT I PAID FOR IT SO I DID TRASH IS THE ONLY WORD THIS BOOK NEEDS TO DISCRIPE IT
5,This book is Explosive,this book was great. I had heard so much about this book and finally picked it up. This book was so interesting i finished it in 2 days. The characters were great and it was cool how Souljah included herself in the story. Knowing Souljah as a rapper who would have ever thought she could be an incredible writer.
4,True to Life,"After reading such books, as the Awakening and Tar Baby, it's so good to read and feel a book as passionate as this one. Well written,the author,rhytmically deciphers the story of Winter Santaiga and her dramatic life. Easy to understand and hard to put down, this novel is one that surely will keep one's attention. Personally, as a escape literature fan, Coldest Winter is a knock-out debut. The story of Winter Santiaga is so vivid, imaginative and realistic, it can be plated out like a movie. I highly recommend this book to any female that wants a dose of reality without the Jerry Springer scenario!"
5,Winter Santiaga must live on!,"How about a sequel? Maybe call it ""Winter Storm"".Winter Santiaga is such a well-developed character, I still think about her daily, even though I finished the book a week ago. I'd love to see her in sequel, either climbing to the top of her father's trade (and maybe competing with Bullet for dominion), or becoming a Sister Souljah protege and rescuing Porche. I don't care what she does, she just needs to live on!"
4,Another clulesss sista.,"I finally read Souljah's first book. Winter Santiaga is like alot of other young brain dead girls. I was surprised how well Sister Souljah perfectly molded Winter into a ghetto princess. Winters world turned into a Ghetto Diva's dream into a young girls life spining out of control.I noticed in this book everytime Winter does something wrong she finds herself in a even worse situation. I only wish that the character Midnight was real, because he seemed so down with what these young immature girls out here are up to. I do recommend that any and everyone will sooner or later read this book."
3,1993? or 2003?,"I read the book and honestly it was OK.Back in '93 they didnt have S600 Benz, Pelle Pelle, prada..etcThe story was placed in 1993 w/ a present day materialistic approach. I feel sister souljah should have researched what was the hot stuff back in 93 not 2003.... and also the fact that sister souljah put herself in the book was tacky. There was really no point to her being in the book. But other than that i really couldn't put the book down."
5,THE BOMBBAY,THIS BOOK WAS TERRIFIC. IT ONLY TOOK ME A DAY AND A HALF TO READ IT. I DID NOT WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN. SISTA SOULJAH PUT HER FOOT IN THIS BOOK AND YOU CAN SURELY TELL. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GIRL.
5,Ghetto Fairytale,"I went through get lengths to get this book and was totally satified. I've always been a Sister Souljah follower since she was in Rutgers. This novel was straight to the point and hardcore. I read it in a complete 7 hours. She has a style synonymous to Donald Goines, which is something any person from Urban Areas can relate to."
5,The Coldest Winter Ever,"""The Coldest Winter Ever"", hasn't been on the Essence bestseller list for nothing. Even hip-hop loving teens who wouldn't read ordinarily, couldn't put it down. This book will go down in history as the fiction title that captured the attention of the Hip-Hop audience and turned them on to reading for pleasure."
3,Not what everybody is screaming over!,The book was great when it got to chapter 18 (it was only 20 chapters in the book). I thought the book was more about the author than Winter. I guess I would have liked it better if I wouldn't have read True To The Game first. The book did kick some knowledge that was missing from True To The Game and B-More Careful. I'll give her some props but avoid all the unrelated info that made the book a slow drag.
5,** LADIES! DIS BOOK BE TELLIN' IT LIKE IT IS ***,"""Winter"" may indeed turn out to be one of the most tragic figures literary history. Read the book. And then read it again. As for myself, I'm reading it a third time and then I'm going to have my daughters read it -- and my son! It certainly is one tough and powerful read. Also check out ""The Good Black"" and ""PSEUDO COOL"". Strong stories about African Americans are in demand and I thank Sister S! for helping to meet this demand! God Bless!"
4,It was great,"I found the book the Coldest Winter Ever, to be well thought out, and well written. My only regret is that it had to end. I hope that Souljah will delight us with part two. I would love to know how Winter turns out after spending time in the pokey. Good book... My entire book club read it and we could not put it down."
5,Culturally relevant,"This book should be read by all African-American youth and young adults. It gives insight into family function and disfunction. This book demonstrates the results that people get in life based on the decisions they make on one end, and the influence that the enviornment can have on youth formulating their philosophy of life, morals and values on another end. Someone should make a motion picture out of this book if it is not already being done. Mainly because many people that are too lazy to read still need to see the lessons that this book teaches. It should be read and discussed on a regular basis, it might be instrumental in transforming the lives of at risk youth. It puts a human face on some of the ills that plague urban culture all across America, and gives explanations, critisims, and solutions to various situations that are faced by people everyday. Here is an example of misdirected intelligence, a common problem in black and latino communities."
4,Coldest Winter Ever,The Coldest Winter ever was a very interesting and a good book to read. I believe everyone should get a chance to read and enjoy this book. This book made me shake my head at Winter because it was so much she could have done with her life. I also think if Sister Soulja was so powerful she should have spent more time and influced winter better than what she did.
4,Freezing in Brooklyn,"Even though I didnt agree with the ending, this book, is one of the best ever written. It was definetly a page turner for me. I have read it almost 3 times now. The characters and places really came alive to me. I always wanted to see what would happen next. Winter's actions, stubborness and lifestyle really showed me the values of African American youth. I Loved how Sister Souljah potrayed Winter as a girl who always wanted her way even if the path was disastrous. Winter had so many chances to turn over a new leaf, but it only hurt her in the end. I felt like I was right there, feeling the pain with her, thats how real this book was to me. This book is very much like our society today in regards to our values. I hope ,unlike Winter, that this book can make people see things more clearly think before they act, and see what's really important in life."
3,This was good,I really did enjoy this book. I didn't like Sister Souljah cameo and it could be because I just read part 2 of Fly girl and the Author was in that book way too much. I had a hard time believing that she never once looks at her situation and thought there has got to be something better. She was supposed to be smart. I also didn't like the way none of the secondary characters where developed. The book is really one-dimensional and there could have been so much more. It would have been nice to find out more about her sisters especially the one who ends up following the same path she did. All in all it was a good book. It does deserve some praise and I can't see it being a movie but anything possible.
3,Where's the moral of the story then ??,"Not sure about this one. The book was well written and all credit to the author. However, it appeared to the very end of the story that no lessons were learnt. You didn't read about Winter REALLY reflecting on the choices she had made. Right up until the end of the story the reader was fed the usual things - money, clothes, designer this and that, as if all of that STILL mattered. Meeting her ex -boyfriend at her mothers funeral with her sisters would have been an ideal opportunity. So many things happened to the reader but I'm not sure whether Winter felt the same way."
4,THE COLDEST WINTER EVER,"THE STORY CAUGHT HAD ME HOOKED FROM THE BEGINNING.I SAW EVERYTHING THAT THE AUTHOR DESCRIBED.(I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO N.Y. IN MY LIFE)I DID NOT WANT TO PUT DOWN THE BOOK.""WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT?"" THE URBAN LIFE PORTRAL WAS VERY REALISTIC , NO MATTER WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT YOU LIVE.I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK EVEN TO THOSE WHO DON'T NORMALLY READ THIS TYPE OF STORY."
5,the coldest winter ever,this book was the best book ive ever read. im still trying to find books similar to this one that i can read and will enjoy. if anyone is thinking about buying this book u should. all my friends have read it and we all love it. oh and if anyone ever finds any good books similar to this one e mail me at Babygirl2290@aol.com thanks
3,Its an Ok Book,this was an ok book .. like it started off good .. and then went down hill for like half of the book .. and towards the end .. it picked back up .. like this isnt a REAL GOOD READ .. but it was an overall good book .. but people would make you think this book was like the best book ever .. this book is average ..
4,Captivating,This story sucks you in from the start though it's unfortunate the life cycle of the Santiaga family. I would recommend this book to anyone enjoys a good page turner.
2,Tired...,"Who are these young women?!! The majority of African American women are not ghetto-born with limited mentalities that focus on sex, drugs and clothes, but I guess the author is writing from what she knows and, therefore, speaks to a certain audience. The book is not well written, the voice arrogant and immature. A disappointment. I expected better."
2,BOOOOOOOOOOO,I swear I was the only person who didn't like this book. I thought Winter needed a beat down by her mother when she was growing up and her life would of been different.
5,Reality,"Two thumbs up for Sister Souljah. This is a great piece of work.It's funny how Winter's mom taught her about looking good and to be a bad b%^&*. I beleive that some people should not have kids if they don't know how to raise them. Winter is an example of some teenagers nowdays. It was a great book, i beleive every young adults should read this book."
5,Best Read Ever,"If you are looking for a read that holds your interest from beginning to end, this is the one book you won't be able to finish without talking about it to everyone you know. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have recommended it to friends and family. The main character is spoiled, extremely audacious, and headstrong. She thinks she's street smart and ahead of the game. But her character has flaws that demonstrate her weakness and vulnerability.This book leads you on a journey that wakes you up to the realities of your own life through this character and her support cast of characters. Each one of them along with the various events of this novel will help to define why this is, in my opinion, one of the ""Best Reads Ever""."
4,WANTING,I just wanted more I had hopes that a WINTER would see the error of her ways and get herself together but I love how MIDNIGHT evolves and didn't continue to live the life the was I guess I can't ask for a happy ending all the time
5,Sister Souljah writes back!,Anyone who is wondering if there will be a sequel...... I e-mailed Sister Souljah and she actually wrote back! she told me that she is half way done with the sequel to The Coldest Winter Ever. She also told me her and Jada Pinkett Smith are producing the movie version of the Coldest Winter Ever for HBO. As far as my review for the book...... GO BUY IT!
2,There is better sofware out there for this great game,"I bought this at the store from the clearance rack for $3.99, and it's not even worth that. First of all, even though you download the software onto your computer, you still need to insert the cd into the computer each time you play. Secondly, the game play with computer opponents is terrible. You can choose from three different skill levels for the computer opponent. The more advanced their skill level, the higher the probaility that the computer opponent will have more favorable rolls, and a higher probability you will have less favorable rolls. This is too bad because I bought the game so my son could play by himself. That being said, the layout is nice, and game play with two or more individuals is nice, but the rating is for the unit as a whole. Skip this cd and buy a different Monopoly cd."
2,THIS IS IT NOTHING MORE????,Loved the first two books but this ending left two much hanging.I thought there would be more in the series. I am terribly disappointed. This was too much of the dark side for me.
3,Arrgh! Left me shaking my head...,"I so much wanted to enjoy this book, having thought the first in the series was excellent. Book 2 started out so well, but then it got to the halfway point where Apropos woke up in the desert and took a nosedive for me. Not that there wasn't a lot of humor, but I kept waiting to find out it was a dream sequence or Apropos was going to travel back in time and repair the problems that had been caused. I don't want to give away too much, because the book is worth reading just for the first few chapters. But keep this in mind if you do read it: what happens in part 2 really happens (in the fictional universe, that is), and will never be undone. Had I know that ahead of time, I probably woulkd have enjoyed it more."
3,Not as good as the first,"Still a wonderful tribute to dark humor. However, not as uproriously funny as the first."
4,A Wonderful Woad...,The Woad to Wuin is an excellent send up of heroic fantasy and is full of wisecracks and humor and loads of action. Apropos is the hero but not the selfless kind seen in most heroic fiction. He's selfish and gutless but at times courageous though usually that's for selfish reasons. It can get bawdy at times so it's recommended for the more mature reader. It's not as funny or adventurous as the first book in the series but it's well done and better than most fantasy novels out there.
1,Filthy- dark- sad,"Although I really enjoyed the first book of this series-- I was less than thrilled with the opening chapter of this book. the bawdy parody of the Lord of the Rings was really over-th-top when it comes to good taste. It is really sad--- And the book just gets darker and darker.. and soon, it drops into a tumbling free fall in which the reader could care less what happens to anybody.David's strength abound in the puns.His major weakness was trying to write a followup to the the first book which was a smash homerun as far as I was concerned. This one is little more than an infield fly out."
1,Awful and disgusting,"I liked book #1, but #2 is just awful.The first chapter is an awful sexual parody of the Lord of the Rings.More than half of the book, a magically invulnerable Apropos is a cruel and evil warlord leading a wild horde in conquest, murder and pillage. Somewhere near the end he breaks the evil spell, but the story up to then is simply unbearably disgusting."
3,"Disappointing, but not bad","After devouring the first book, Sir Apropos of Nothing, I was a bit disappointed by this book. While amusing in parts and certainly lacking nothing in wordplay, it lacked the edge of the absurd that characterized the first book. I hardly ever laughed aloud, which I did regularly before. It seemed to lack a great deal of the comedy of before, resorting instead to crudeness in the Lord of the Rings parody, followed by a very long-winded lesson in morality that was the rest of the book. Buy this first. Check this one out from the library."
2,Not for all U2 fans . . .,"Well it's a whole lot better than that sorry excuse of the Philharmonic Orchestra playing U2. A lot of the songs actually work here. Heaven 17's ""With or Without You"" kept teasing with the percussion not kicking in till almost the end of the song. Since I'm not into goth, it's hard for me to get into some of the songs. The Polecats version of Desire as previously mentioned has a ska-ish type feel. Tiffany singing New Year's Day, well this alone should be reason to buy this, in a Shatner-does-the-Beatles kinda way."
2,the Mission does a U2 song?,"Ok, I'll give it 2 stars. And then I'll be completely honest here in that I haven't listened to anything other than the track by the Mission. It's not that I don't like U2. I mean, who doesn't like them... but cover songs are a little weird. (remember, this is my opinion) U2 is alive and well and these songs were great in the first place. If it isn't broke don't fix it. On the other hand - I do agree with some of the reviewers points about a different spin on the songs. It almost seems disloyal to do that (again, my opinion). My question is -- why was this album made? I mean, I know why the Cheap Trick and Queen cover ones were made -- those bands are done recording now. But U2? Is it flattery?"
2,keep this in mind,"I'm a fan of U2, I have 27 cd's which I collected through out the world. These cd does not fit with my soft ear. It's too techno."
1,This Is Wrong!!,"No offense to any of the bands on this album but this is just plain wrong. I agree 100% with a tribute to U2 but tributes should not use the band's songs. It would be much better to write original songs, and would probably mean more to the said band. Anyone else playing the songs is an insult to the band. Especially ""One."" That's the best song ever written in the history of rock'n'roll and no one but U2 has the right and is worthy enough to sing or play it. This is just wrong. I am a long time and dedicated U2 fan and this is wrong."
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"Don't be fooled by reviews which praise this album! It's real junk. I own 37 CDs by U2 and I'd like to consider myself somewhat of connoisseur on our four favorite Irish lads. I wish I could say that my collection only included 36...We Will Follow was a horrible choice. It's not that it's just my worst U2 CD; it's my worst CD. The covers are atrocious and violate the spirit of U2. So if you're curious enough to get a coveralbum, and that's a decent curiosity, get ""Zoovenir."" We Will Follow is just terrible. Save yourselves!"
1,"Sorry, but this is crap!","Don't buy this CD if you think it has good cover versions of U2's famous hits! All the titles are crap. I'm sorry, gotta say that! Don't misunderstand me, I'm a huge U2 fan, I have about 30 different U2 CDs at home, but I gotta warn you don't buy this!"
1,not worth free,These timers are horrible. They are not worth FREE ... if they gave them away you would NOT want one. They are problematic and setting them is beyond hard. Don't make the mistake of trying one.
2,flaky!,"This is a pretty junky curling iron, although I didn't have problems with the locking mechanism like the other reviewer did. But, it is pretty ineffective and, after just a few uses, the ceramic coating started to flake off into my hair. (I actually bought 2 of them, one for home and one for travel, and they BOTH are flaky). I have very dark hair, so it looks REALLY bad when the light-colored ceramic flakes off into it! Gross!"
1,very dissapointed with this horrible product,"I bought this on a whim after my old curling iron finally bit the dust. I figured it was a good deal being a ""2-in-1"" straightening iron and curling iron. I tried it out the next morning and well...it was a mess. For one thing, when you plug it in and turn it on, there's a smell akin to burning plastic that quickly fills the room. I tried to ""lock"" the straightening iron in place so I could curl my hair, but the lock would never work. So I figured, well, at least I have a new straightening iron...so wrong. The plates have a large gap between them when you try to clamp them onto a strand of hair, which did me no good at all. I ended up wearing a ponytail, frustrated and a little nauseated from the overpowering stench. Do not buy this junk...period."
1,Pelican Breif wannabe,"Enviornmental topics always attract my interest,so I eagerly read this novel about NY's Adirondack Mountains. The book initially promises to communicate the message of concern but rapidly becomes an ambitious use of the Thesaurus. Complete with it's soft core porn scenes, The Temagami Factor is a Pelican Brief ""wannabe."" Predictable, disappointing and rudimentary, it is definitely a lightweight summer read."
1,Good...but only the historical part...the rest...skip!!,"This is a book that contains plenty of historical,valuable information. The problem begins when the author start dishing out his views on the subject. He obviously thinks he is well versed on money and economic affairs. Regretfully he only shows he is totally clueless on the subject. My problem with this book is that the author wraps around the historical facts his misguided theories which may create confusion and teach the wrong ideas to those who do not have much knowledge on the subject of economic and monetary theory. This is dangerous and toxic from the didactic point of view.In short, while it does have some historical factual mistakes, you may decide to read it any way. Just skip the author's opinions and you will be fine."
3,Try Hauppauge - the quality is better,"This card worked well with Windows Vista and was easy to install and set up, but my 2-year old Hauppauge WinTV PVR PCI II (23xxx) dual tuner has a much better picture. I noticed the difference immediately. I could see halos around gradient objects and artifacts that are not there with my Hauppauage card. Installed the Hauppauge card back in and the video was clearly superior.Also, this card will only get HD when using an external over the air HD antenna hooked up to it. I do not believe you could use this through an HD cable box to record HD TV, which is what I originally thought."
1,Wait for revision 2,"ATI has pulled this card from store shelves. I don't know why Amazon still offers it, but you can't find it elsewhere. A new revision fixing some buggy hardware will be released in mid October.This is a great tuner, but I'd wait for the revision ;)"
2,HDTV on PC,"The card works and produces a reasonable image, but the ""Catalyst"" software used to drive the card is lacking/buggy. To make work, I had to disable the SCSI CD burner in the system (or the software would hang for several minutes before working). The sofware is slow to open/respond, beyond that the ability to size the TV window is very limited. This card replaced a standard TV card in my system that I bought for $25. I used the old card more because it would open quickly and I could resize the window to be small (non intrusive) while I was working on other things. On the plus size, I can expand the HDTV card to larger windows while retaining a good image."
2,Does not work correctly with Windows Media Center in Vista,"The picture quality with this card is great. It does a very good job encoding analog cable TV. However, with Windows Media Center in Vista, the card cannot be configured for both analog cable and OTA HDTV. Supposedly, a Microsoft hotfix should resolve this issue but it didn't work for me. A Hauppage WinTV-HVR-1600 works fine for both analog cable and OTA HDTV, but it's analog picture quality is not as good."
5,Great Card,"I used this card to for my Beyond TV 4.6 program that I am running on my PC.I am running Digital Cable and it is running great with that. If you are thinking about getting one, make the jump and do it!"
1,Buggy Card...HORRIBLE Software,"I'm an experienced PC builder. I build all my family's computers as a hobby. I've successfully installed some tough (compatibility wise) hardware & software in my time. This ATI TV Wonder card was a worst case scenario by far. The card worked to different degrees with different ""trial"" software (Intervideo, BeyondTV, SageTV, etc). The card did not function completely and/or correctly with any software, especially the ATI Cataylst Software. The ATI Cataylst Software is a total disaster when paired with this TV Wonder card. (I used to have an ATI AIW Pro 9600 video card that worked OK with the Catalyst Software...don't know what's happened at ATI.) I called ATI after 3 days of frustration and their Tech told me to return the card to Amazon. I started the RMA process immediately. This card is not for the fainthearted or inexperienced PC user. (For comparison, I also have a Hauppauge WinTV card that performed, and continues to perform, flawlessly, on my PC."
1,"Junk, don't buy ! I rate it ZERO but was forced to pick 1.","picture quality fuzzy, jerky and didn't sync with audio. support lacking and had me spending 10 hours messing around trying to get it to work instead of just taking care of it while i was on the line the first time. had to leep calling backand going thru their computer phone maze. then there is shipping and 15% restocking! it also messed up my computer. xp, p4"
2,Great picture but that's about it.,"I purchased this card because I have on another computer the AIW9700 Pro. The 9700 Pro card has been a great card and I thought the 650 would be also. Well, the TV picture is great once you get the card working. The catalyst software to record programs is worthless. I cannot get it to connect with Titan. Tech support is also worthless. I have been using the Gemstar software from the 9700 Pro to see what TV guide programs are playing. I can record programs while I am at the computer but there is no VCR type functionality to record while I am away. I am extremely disappointed with ATI/AMD that they would sell a product that does not work fully and at the same time not support it properly. I hope they are not naive enough to think they will get repeat business with this kind of customer service."
4,Horrible support and Vista is unsupported,"""In addition, the TV Wonder 650 is ready for the Windows Vista operating system. In fact, this device is even Windows Vista Premium ready, which ensures that you will be able to take full advantage of the TV Wonder 650's powerhouse media capabilities for years to come.""This is completely untrue. I've been using Vista since RTM and have spoken with ATI support before RTM and after. Before RTM I contacted ATI to see which TV Tuners would be supported in Vista as I was buidling a new HTPC. They responded stating the TV Wonder 650 worked with Vista and would have drivers available for RTM. I purchased the card with this in mind and am yet to see even beta drivers for Vista. The last response I got from ATI customer support was: ""Please note that AMD Customer care does not support Windows Vista.""I gave the TV Tuner 4 of 5 stars because it did work well with XP SP2 MCE 2005."
1,this card is a big joke,"The software install froze on a new windows system! I never got a chance to see it working, and I'm not willing to be ATI's guinea pig and waste any more time with this."
1,Incredibly superficial!,"I found this book incredibly superficial, the only group of people I could possibly imagine recommending it to are those with no common sense. Instead of wasting money on this book, I would recommending putting ""baby advice"" as a search term into your news reader, you will end up with much more in-depth information.Per another comment on here, I watched the reality show 'Pregnant in Heels' featuring the 'author', and was horrified how she convened a group of strangers to name her child. Traditional naming considerations such as family, friends, religion didn't factor in, instead it was all about what would give the child the best 'brand.' Ugh! I couldn't believe it when she stated, completely without irony, how excited she was that that the same people who name toothpastes will be naming her child. This is not the kind of 'expert' I want having anything to do with advice for my child."
3,good for a gift to a new parent,I think this book is good for a shower gift to a first time mom. I bought this when my daughter was 13 months old and I had already experienced and dealt with a majority of the issues covered in the book.
5,Great stuff!,Great information for everything from installing your car seat to communicating with your baby.
2,Short lasting,THIS DECAL BEGAN PEELING WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF ME HAVING IT. NOT GREAT FOR CAR WINDOWS ESPECIALLY IF YOU PLAN ON EVER WASHING YOUR CAR AGAIN. WATER AND THIS DECAL DO NOT MIX....ITS CUTE BUT NOT VERY LASTING.
2,not kid durable,"We have owned this dvd player for almost one year. We wish the battery had a longer life. My 4.5 yr old has dropped it a couple of times and the hinge is broke. Also, it skips when you hit a bump in the car or open the stand to sit it up on the table. You have to hold the buttons in for a couple seconds for them to work and my son gets a little frustrated. We do like the design, but wish it was more kid durable."
3,Worked well until it didn't,"I bought this for long car trips for my kid. It did it's job in keeping her entertained. There were few issues with operation (no skipping, sound issues, etc.) In fact, it strapped behind the driver's headrest, and as long as the volume was not too loud, the driver (me) was not bothered by the volume level. The picture quality and sound (I did climb in the back to watch once or twice) was exceptional for the price.However, after limited usage over 1+ year, the sound and display suddenly went out. After some tinkering (open up and jiggle the optical cable), I have gotten the sound to return. Due to the age of the item (> 1yr) and cost, I can *wish* I got more life than 6-10 long trips, but that's about it.I now have the opportunity to ""crack it open"" and see if I can restore both pic and sound. If you're looking for a durable dvd player, look elsewhere. If you want economical and have low expectations, grab one."
1,general ecology,"service from general ecology was poor---had item for repair, top only for leaking fittings.three weeks later had not shipped back--after calls to rude service people my item was shipped, to the wrong address in another state---"
1,Mixed up mastering of the disc,I was really looking forward to this CD. I like The Sixteen very much. Now for the problem: The actual tracks on the CD are not The Sixteen but a random assortment of other artists. It appears that the company that produced this CD mixed up the mastering and did not do a due diligence to ensure quality control. I returned the first CD and Amazon promptly sent me another CD with the same problem. This was true disappointment.
1,Good Book for The Complete Novice,"I think this would be a very good book for anyone that had no exposure to flats fishing in their past. However, for anyone that has evan a basic knowledge of fishing in these areas, I feel that the book is too elementary and of very little benefit."
3,Good Theory but bad numbers,"The book is good for opening the readers mind to the possibilities of real estate investing. I was amazed at the number of miscalculations and typing errors counting nearly 100. I have an advanced degree in Finance and found this book to be horribly inaccurate, as far as the numbers. Some of the rates of loans, inflation, and Caps you will never see in your lifetime. Based on his numbers property values would have to be half of their current value and produce the same income. Good for principals for the very beginner, please read other books before you really invest or you will have a rude awakening. I recommend a college text. If you don't understand it you have no business investing in real estate."
3,Another..,"basic beginners book. A little better at the math than most, in that it actually covers numbers. Yes, the book is 8 yrs old and the interest rates used are a little out of line, but the formulas are the same. One beef I have with books like these is that they rely way too much on appreciation to make an investment successful. Tanzer uses 5%! Yes this happens in certain areas, but never on a consistent basis, and definitely not in all areas. The way to invest and not speculate is to not count on inflation or even appreciation in your purchase numbers, then when it happens its just tacked on as a bonus when you sell the property.His info on where to find funds is pretty basic. Laughable when he gets to ""Sources You May Have Overlooked"" and his big idea is, drumroll please....family and friends! Puh-lease!Some versions come with a disk tutorial. Did not review this."
5,Well-written and informative,"Mr. Tanzer gives the reader the 'how to' of investing in real estate. Many examples guide you through his methodology. He makes the math easy to understand and his writing style is clear, concise, and understandable. He takes the mystery out of investing in real estate and, for the first-time investor, the knowledge to go ahead with your first real estate purchase. If you're thinking about buying an apartment building, office building, etc., you will want this book. Well worth the price."
2,"Good sound, but very poorly made","sound quality is very good, but the side extender broke many times in both ears. DEfinetly not recomended for heavy users.Pros: Good sound, excellent DETACHABLE cable (great idea), switch to change sound preferences.Spanish:Buena calidad de sonido, pero los soportes de los auriculares son un desastre, tengo estos audífonos casi un año y los soportes se han roto por lo menos cinco veces. Funciona repararlos con pegamento, pero es muy molesto, y sabes que se volverá a romper. Definitivamente no los recomiendo para usuarios que quieren usar sus audífonos todos los días. Adicionalmente para algunas personas los auriculares resultan un poco incómodos.Ventajas: Tienen buen sonido, posee un cable que se puede separar de los audífonos lo cual resulta excelente para guardarlos."
2,Good sound and nice features but still a poor buy,"I got these headphones about two years ago on a recommendation from a friend as my Sony v700s were beaten to death from traveling and djing out. I am going back to Sony after this.The sound quality is strong, nice lows and crisp highs. Also has some fun features like a light that blinks to the beat that would always crack people up late at night. Also a nice kill switch for the lows and highs for some Dj's that look for different frequencies when they mix.But the design and sturdiness is just weak. 6 months after I got them the sound just went out on the right ear. They had barley been used. I sent them to Stanton and after about 60 days they came back fixed. And now two years later the plastic head extension just broke off as I took them off in the studio."
3,nice but not durable,I bought these for my son for Christmas. He is an adult and not a child who would miss use them but they did crack not a month after getting them. When he was taking them off one time the side where it attaches to the ear cup cracked. They are not real durable I guess and they are plastic which for the price I would have expected more metal. He says their quaility of sound is great and he loves them except for the fact they broke easily. Hopefully it was just a fluke or bad set and I hope they stand behind their product and replace them.
2,Standont,I use the Stanton DJ Pro 3000 mainly for video/audio editing and after about two yeas the right side extender broke. Its a shame because they are comfortable and they put out good sound but bad design for sure. They should of lasted a lot more than that. BTW i warped both sided with Duck Tape and will continue to use them.
1,Weak Plastic Design,"I bought these headphones as a gift for a young DJ just before his first gig. They actually did not last through the performance. As he removed them from the top of his head, the left ear cup detached/broke from the head band. For all the hype regarding Stanton, I expected a more durable product. I was surprised, stunned and embarrassed to have purchased such worthless garbage."
2,not made to last,"I used my pair for making/mixing home recordings. Sound quality is good, but the design is poor. The support for my left ear phone simply broke without unusual stress or mishandling. I simply took them off, put them down and the next time I tried to put them on, found the left phone dangling. The design puts a great deal of stress on the plastic support (poor material choice, ultimately, read ""cheap""), something I presume led to stress fracture and breakage over time, maybe 2 years of regular but not frequent use. To the reviewers who have tried to mend with duct tape, I'm all admiration. My duct tape repair wouldn't let the left phone rest vertically on my ear. The broken plastic support, as far as I can see, has really rendered them useless...can't play guitar while having to use one hand to keep the headphones in place! In sum, a good sounding earphone suffering from planned obsolescence. Steer clear."
4,"good price, good quality.","We were excited to save by buying this online instead of paying much more in store. We were more excited when it came, and it was just what we expected it to be. Looks good in our newly updated kitchen. Fits great and works well. Nice and quiet when turned on."
3,Thinner..cheaper feeling than I was expecting. Very basic,"Thinner..cheaper feeling than I was expecting. Very basic. Fan is slightly loud, not too bad--but not quiet. The one I removed was a Broan as well, but more substantial and with dual filters--this only has one and I can't see where it would do much. It looks nicer than the greasy one I removed so that's a plus. I think I would have gone for a higher grade of hood if I had known the ""thin"" feel of this one."
4,Too pricey,"Now that the price has dropped they would be worth the price. They are nice and if you buy matching pot holders, you can accessorize your kitchen."
1,Horrible,"As others have said, these towels do not dry dishes or pots and pans--they just kind of smear the water around. They seem to work well enough on hands, though. Also, I had to wash and dry them many times to get rid of the fuzz they were leaving on clean dishes. They're not worth the hassle. And I bought eight at the higher price! I got my old towels out of the basement closet again. I'll use them while the search continues."
2,How can a dish cloth not absorb water?,"I had looked everywhere for red & black dishclothes and was happy to finally discover these. The color choices are wonderful and they are a bit oversized which is nice, but I bought them as dishclothes and they do not absorb water. At all. I've tried washing them to no avail. Now I have four perfectly colored dishclothes that are basically useless."
1,Too small,This is supposed to be a dish cloth? It's way too small to do anything. (it's the size of a face towel) It was a waste buying it.
2,Don't be confused,"I had previously bought a KITCHEN towel and we loved it. I wanted a second one and ended up buying a DISH CLOTH unknowingly instead since that was the one that came up when I went looking for it.The cost of sending it back would've been almost the price of the towel so we kept it. It was much smaller and much less exorbitant in the kitchen towel. Buyer beware!Calphalon Checked Terry Kitchen Towel, Black LicoriceCalphalon Terry Dish Cloth, Black Licorice"
2,Overpriced on Amazon.com,"Before you buy this item, check out the Calphalon website. MSRP for the dish cloth is only $3.99. Amazon.com is charging $6.99. When I complained to customer service, I just received a canned answer about how they cannot monitor all their prices."
5,The best RTS you've never played.,"KAG is one of the best games ever made. It is a true classic and one of my all time favorites. One warning is that the Kohan series is very different from typical ""RTS"" games, in that it is about strategy more than tactics of rapid clicking. It isn't especially difficult to play, but it is more of a thinking man's game, than your usual click fest."
4,Better then they say,I am not saying this is a literary masterpiece...but it is a good book. I an hesitant to recommend it to younger kids though - it is rather dark. As a middle aged woman I would say it is too dark and deep to be fully understood by kids.
1,Painful to read,I agree. The author seemed to try to write deeply and it came out horribly. I had never found a truely awful book before this one. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Spare yourself.
5,Intrigue on the High Seas.,"Meg Delgado has an exciting career as a private investigator in cruise ship crime. Her latest assignment is to catch a thief. She's already got a suspect in mind, a debonair Cary Grant type named Noah Danforth. They both discover that deceptions and disguises lead to danger...and to romance."
5,"The Faerie Way, by Hugh Mynne is Wonderful!","This book is great. I couldn't put it down until I had read it from cover to cover!This is good if you want to read from a SINCERE author on the Fae. It is evident from his writings that Hugh has a deep admiration & respect for the Fae. I am happy to say that I can recommend this book. I am very pleased! I can see why it was bought up so quickly. I hope it goes to reprint soon. I wanted to buy a copy for some friends. Thank you Hugh, for a fascinating book."
4,Jack's Consistent,"This is another good and well-balanced album from Jack Johnson and crew at Brushfire Records. Everything that Jack personally touches here is gold, but there are some other 'good' (not 'gold') accompaniments. Matt Costa is showing himself to be very consistent as well, offering a well written and melodic piece much like he did on the Curious George album. The one draw back on this album that gave me pause and why I would only give it a 4 star rating is the injections of spoken monologs that are included from the start of the album all the way on through. I am a surfer and I still find them annoying..."
4,EEEEaaaassssyyyy,"Another cool, chill, laid back feel that one would expect from anything with Jack Johnson's name on it.For some reason the Vedder song just blows me away in how great a song it is and how simple a song it is."
2,3 of the SAME Movie,"This is a ""collection"" of 3 of the same movie! I would not buy unless it is a singular movie, or maybe 3 different movies. Who needs 3 of the same movie?"
2,Seriously mixed quality,"This collection feels like they gathered up all the B-list documentaries in hopes they would sell better as a package. Some of the information is even contradictory. I bought this for my daughter who loves dinosaurs, and she really doesn't mind, but I can't recommend this collection to anyone else."
4,Good,"I bought this because my 4 year old is obsessed with dinosaurs, I wasnt sure whether he would like it since it was a documentary but overall he has enjoyed watching it. Parts of the movie are a bit boring but overall it has some great depictions of dinosaurs and it is a movie I can stand to watch with my son without getting to bored. The collection is long and is on two discs so you might not make it through the whole movie."
4,"Good headphones, and may be flawless for you","Ok, for writing a 1000th review on a headphones, I'll just say I've tried or owned about every single headphones they're is on the market. Lightweight, closed, earbud, volume control, ones that elimanate outside noise, and ones like these, behind the neck headphones.One thing I have to say is, they are actually pretty comfortable, unlike other types of behind-the-neck headphones. The sound quality on them is pretty good, with banging bass and clear highs and lows. They aren't too expensive, and they are kind of portable.One thing I do have to point out. The cord is kind of short. Though, for portable player listeners, this shouldn't be a problem. Though, you'll feel like a dog on a leash if you use them for a computer were you have to hook them up far away (that is if you don't have a headphone plug on your speakers.)Overall, these are a good buy. I would get these if you like this style and/or using a portable player."
3,Huh?... Speak-up please,"The headphones are very comfortable and lightweight, but volume is not very loud. With my MP3 player fully cranked-up playing a ""best of"" Van Halen CD on the subway train it's hard to tell if it's Sammy or Dave, once the train gets going."
5,Love It,My son got this for his first christmas. He still loves it among his other toys. You should she him go and loves to hear the sounds. Wonderful riding toy.
2,Bad Connection?,"I installed this switch w/Fender pickups and solid soldered connections. Sometimes if I switch pickups I have to jiggle it to make the new connection , I will replace it with a higher end unit."
1,Did not get a FIVE way switch,Instead of a FIVE way switch like the SEALED package says it contains a FOUR way switch WTF. If someone could point me to the appropriate action to take that would be greeeaaaat.
1,Wrong items in package,"Twice I order two -5- way switches from this store , & each time I recieve only one -5- way switch. The other was a -4- way""packed in a 5 way bag. to have this happen once would be understandable, but twice in two orders is no accident. this company is not reliable. I did not need to open the items to see the differance, the seller can see what there packing & sends the wrong item."
2,4 Way Switch,I got a four way switch instead of a five way. All the packaging said it was a five way so I assumed this was just a one time mix up but apparently this has happened to a few other people. I just kept it (the four ways are more expensive and I'm planning on buying a Tele anyway) but if you're looking for the five way switch it might be better to look elsewhere.
2,Fell apart,"I bought this switch in August 2012. It became loose last week and, when I had to open up my guitar to investigate, the gear mechanism completely fell apart even before I could unscrew it from the pick guard. Perhaps I got a bad one but it's disappointing since Fender is in the name."
3,I like these and have used them in countless guitars but there are better out there.,I've wired and rewired countless guitars and have had a couple fail recently. Don't know if their QC has gone downhill or what. I didn't send them back because they're usually around $10 but it's disconcerting when a Fender product unexpectedly fails. It would have 5 stars but for the recent failures.
5,Sublime,"The audience participation is minimal, as other reviews have noted, and some of the lines are incredible. Dalla Sua Pace brought me to tears with its beauty and emotion--unlike any other I'd heard before. Definitely worth adding to your library."
3,Mozart: Don Giovanni,"Very good recording of an open air performance, but not quite up to the quality of a studio recording."
4,Mud Flap,THis product was exactly what was described and fit really well on my F250 ford pickup. Did front and back flaps and they both fit well. Took about an hour to install.
4,Good fit,These have a good fit and look good on the truck. Couple of the holes lined up with factory and had to drill a couple.
4,Interesting Story with a wonderful message!,"The Phillips/Pella team has a way of making their characters come to life for the reader. The storyline was very interesting and stirred my heart. I have read other Phillips' novels, and he always seems to be able to explain things of a Christian nature in ways that are understandable. I always learn a lesson after reading on of his books. Thank you Mr. Phillips! This is not an intense read, but it was lovely just the same. I am on to the next book in this series and can't wait to dig in to it! I recommend this book to anyone who would like a nice, low-keyed read. Very good!"
2,"A touching story, low keyed, suitable for young readers.","Corrie kept excellent Christian values despite the hardships she faced. Corrie is courageous throughout. It is written so even younger readers can understand. The story line continues in the next in the series and they are both well written, without foul language nor graphic violence. A great alternative to contemporary fiction reading. I would recommend this book to any woman of any age for light, enjoyable reading."
4,"great functionality, poor finish","I really like this lighter. It lights cigars well and is very comfortable. My only complaint is the stuff they use to put the 'gunmetal' panels on it. The stuff comes appears to be some kind of a sticker, and it comes off pretty quickly. I am considering sending it back to Xikar to see if they can put the colored panels on it, since the colored panels are made of stuff that looks like it would be more durable."
3,Nice lighter,"Was a gift for my grandpa, have bought him a few in the past so paid a lil more for this one hoping it would last, it didnt. It died a month after he got it. He took it into his smoke shop and they replaced it no questions asked, but is disappointing to me it stopped working so quickly and he had to replace."
4,lots of fun,"i loved this tale of an alternate possible truth to the noah story. i love anachranism, anyway, so this flood of it (ha ha!!) was right up my alley. i found myself telling others about it over and over, although i couldn't really do it justice. in fact, i'm on amazon right now buying it for a holiday prezzie for a friend. i thought it was lots of fun and wish i could read on....perhaps another one????"
5,OLD SCHOOL EXCELLENCE!!,THIS IS A TOP TEN OLD SCHOOL FLICK THAT DEFINANETLY NEEDS TO BOUGHT IF YOUR A COLLECTOR. IVE WATCHED THIS MORE TIMES THEN ANY OTHER FLICK THAT I HAVE. THIS AND MYSTERY OF CHESS BOXING..AND MAYBE THE VICTIM...
5,Putting the 'art' in old school martial arts,"This is rated as 5 stars for 'needs to be in your collection' not the 'be all end all.' This film is what old kung fu should be, and what remastered dvds from that era should look and sound like today. The picture and sound are great, and includes an original language track. The story is good, if not a little predictable, but well paced.The fights are amazing. Some fights are true martials arts (just to see who is the best with no intention to hurt the other person), some are real fights, some are ambush/brawls. With the different styles, the different masters, the weapons used, and then a story to wrap them together, this becomes such a great sampling of the way it should have been done back then.The rest has been said in other reviews. Buy it if you like, or are interested in, classic kung fu."
3,Good film not great,I purchased this film based on the high rating the other viewers gave this film it's action packed and the Jack Long was good as the old Master. But to see so many 5 star ratings you would expect to see excellence which I did'nt I have purchased several movies that recieved low ratings that in my opinion where very good. To me the fight scenes were basic and the story line was typical done before but dont get me wrong this is a good film and well worth pocessing but not a 5 star.
3,Not all that Grand...,"This is NOT a 5 star flick. It's not horrible. But it's far from great. This movie doesn't even make my top 25. I purchased it because I am in the process of getting all my old VHS tapes on DVD. I consider myself an amateur collector and as such this movie should be in the library. But if you're looking for something with a convoluted plot masked as a mystery, I'd go for the Mystery of Chessboxing. Same cast, better flick.The movie does have great music in it. And it's beautifully shot. But outside of that, I can't see anyone other than a collector being into this one."
2,Not as Good as Other Kung Fu,"I saw a clip of this and then decided to buy it. I was wrong, the story is O.K. but most of it is pretty lame. The other ""masters"" are far to nice. Stick with Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee for real kung fu."
5,WOW !!!,"Wow, that's all I can say about this book. This book saved my life!!! I was so confused and lost in AP Environmental Science I was considering not even taking the test, But this book saved me and my transcript. Thanks to this book I can truly sing out loud: ""I got 5 on it!"" This book is a must have!! After seeing how well I did, my teacher checked the book out and agreed it's better than Princeton review and Barron's combined. Quick, simple, straightforward, WOW!"
2,It's... simply not enough.,"The AP Environmental Science Exam has made, somewhat of a boost in difficulty. After taking both the 2004 and 1998 practice exams, I was relatively confident that the Smarty Pants Guide contained everything that I needed for the test. However, when I took the test just a few days ago (07') the test was substantially more detailed than I expected it to be...It's alright, perhaps, for the previous exams, but it's outdated now... don't get it for a review of basic concepts, at best."
2,too simple,"I teach APES and have read the APES Princeton Review cover-to-cover. There is no comparison. I imagine if you waited until the last moment and had done essentially no review, would be satisfied with a 3 or less on the AP test, Smartypants might help you see the basics of the basic - much like a conceptual chemistry book might assist you with the real deal. But why would you bother when there are other review books and material online that are so much more thorough? I felt this book was over priced and woefully inadequate: it had big print, was double spaced and a mere 117 pages, including tests. And speaking of test questions... you'd be much better off using your textbook's companion website than using these questions. I'm giving Smartypants a thumbs down."
1,Waste of money and time. Unprofessionally written and unhelpful!,"After purchasing this book I was disappointed and even insulted by the pure nature of this composition of such dreadful and unprofessional work. Perhaps it was my high expectations from such highly remarked reviews but I have never been so ashamed for purchasing a book in my life. Being a respectable professional in the environmental science field, I question how this book can help anyone out at all, with the construction of the exam today. This book will do little if any in preparation for the exam, my advice is to do more research or be prepared to waste 1 hours of your life on this short and unprofessional piece of work."
5,LASHAUN IS NUMBER ONE,"LASHAUN YOUR ALBUM IS THE BEST. I AM 17 YEARS OLD, I'M SAVED. IHAVE BEEN SAVED FOR FIVE YEARS, BUT I WASN'T REALLY FOUCSED ON GOD. NOW MY MIND IS MADE UP AND I HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST FOR FOUR MONTHS, AND YOUR ALBUM IS HELPING ME TO HOLD ON. I LISTEN TO IT EVERY DAY. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND GOD BLESS."
5,My Lord Have Mercy!,Listen up everybody!! i am a huge fan of Lashun Pace i have all ofr her cds ...good god the lord must have given this child something great to be able to sing something as amazing as this. I am an aspiring gospel siger and everyday i listen to this angel and she inspires me! I just want to say one thing to my manager you are the worst !andrew ! you could have at least told me about Lashun! if you agree with me that my manger is the worst email me and ill give you his email address! WELL GOD BLESS LASHUN GO OUT AND BUY HER CD!
2,'80's Soul,"Saw some names of artistes from the '60's-'70's I loved, so I bought this without further research, thinking the music would be from that era. Plus Ian Levine is a living legend, so it had to be good!...My mistake.All the tunes are '80's Soul."
1,No Pins - No Watch Band,"This watch band is easy to hand twist on the watch and hand twist off the watch. The problem is after extended wear the pins that hold the watch band to the watch can loosen and fall off the watch without the owner's knowledge. The pins for this watch band are not interchangable with the leather straps. You can purchase replacement pins for the leather straps however, for this ""two-tone Band"" you are out of luck. In my opinion extra pins should be a part of this watch band's package or at least the ""smart folks"" that designed it should be aware that the pins can become loose and fallout. If I am totally wrong and I can purchase replacement pins please let me know other than that 1/2 star for this poorly designed product. Latest Scoop - I was able to find replacement pins at the Steinhausen website http://www.steinhausenonline.com/ it shouldn't have been a problem locating them at all. I give the watch band Three Stars and Amazon 1/2 Star for making this difficult."
4,Great History book for young readers,"I am very impressed with the detail of this book. 2nd - 4th graders are introduced to the Puritans' struggle for religious freedom and their tendency to fall back to old patterns of persecution. Roger Williams and his family are portrayed as the real people they were, making it easy for the ready the empathize. However, the books ends with the comment that the separation of church and state has been secured by our constitution, which is untrue. The separation of church and state is an idea that came through a court decision years after the constitution was ratified."
4,Europa Universalis,"I am a fan of Historical Strategy games such as the Civilization series and Cross of Iron. I would have to say that Europa Universalis is one of the better Historical Strategy games I have played. The game is challanging and will keep you playing. Spans pretty much the whole world, except for the interior of of some of the continents which is fairly accurate for the time. Conquest, Religion, Diplomacy, Economics, and even Royal Marriages all play there part as you struggle to win, if not just to survive. Overall, a very enjoyable game that will be continued to be played."
1,"It could have been great, but...","EU2 could have been a great game, but if you enjoy playing online, don't even consider buying it! Due to the numerous bugs and lack of developer support, the multiplayer function is just useless. Sweden-based developer Paradox does not seem to be working on a patch that would fix the problem. This is terribly frustrating, since such a game would really reach a new dimension by introducing decent multiplayer capabilities.Plus if you have Windows XP, you won't be able to see the cinematics due to a compatibility problem.I'm fed up with these developers or publishers promising things to convince you to buy their products, and not delivering these things. I just cannot imagine what it would give if drugs or car companies did the same."
3,Not Bad!,"You gotta like this game if you have played Europa Universalis I. It isn't much different but still interesting and time passing game. Only drawback is that there no real enhacements for the game, example you find difficulty to find a provision on the map."
1,Refuse to spend more money on this game.,"I owned the first version of this game and found it a major disapointment. Although the game had been in Europe for many months, the English version was very buggy and had several major game issues. It was only through reading the online support rooms that I was able to figure out why the game was acting in certain ways. Once I did I wish I hadn't. Then the game became too easy. I found myself handicapping myself more and more just to make the game interesting. Are you a francophile and want to play as France? Forget it! The game started in 1492 and by 1600 you could rule the world. Someone even did it as Etheopia (although that did take several more years). Sadly games aren't returnable since I'd like to see if this game is the one they should have put out with EUI but I wouldn't risk my (money) on it."
3,Europa Crashiversalis,"I love the game, when it works. The game crashes on me whenever I'm within 10 years of the end. It's not a memory or speed problem, I have more than enough of both in my Sony Vaio. And, the crashes continued even after I downloaded the 1.6 patch. The most annoying part is that my e-mails to the company for technical support have gone unanswered for what is now close to two weeks; I haven't even received confirmation e-mails in response. Very poor service, to say the least. I wouldn't recommend it at this point."
4,WARNING A GAME THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU USE YOUR HEAD,EU2 is one of those games where you have to think long and hardbefore you make your move.You cant just take over a country.Youhave to think how big the army is how big is yours and so forth?Useing diplomecy instead of force is also a good idea.The choice:over 200 nations means that the replay value is quite high.Graphics:so-so Music:A+ Difficulty:you bet Overall:A EU forum:A+So if you a like history-based game that might make you thinkthen get EU2.
4,"If you like Gerald, you'll like this CD","This 1996 CD is great - acoustic (largely nylon string guitar plus pedal steel on some tracks). There are mellow, acoustic versions of Whored Out Again, God Never Lived in My Neighborhood, and To Break the Ice. It isn't all the same material as the self-titled CD -- there are other great songs here [Bender (I'm On One), Third Rock from the Sun, Boozin' Time, I'm not coming Back...] It is definitely worth buying -- and like the self-titled album, it grows on you the more you listen to it."
1,Waste of money,"got this as it looked good in the photos, was a total waste of money as it is very uncomfortable to wear and kinda too small. Dont buy this you have better option for the same price"
3,Good,"Yeah, it's good. I really like the Champs, Voivod's Nothingface, Drive Like Jehu, and King Crimson's Red- and so do Don Caballero. They're good. Too bad every song on here sounds like Discipline by King Crimson and Robert Fripp's League of Gentlemen album, the guitar tapping technique, as can be seen in the KC segment of Bill Bruford and the Beat instructional video I think Damon Che has probably watched over and over again. Don Cab are good. I think their next one is going to be their best yet. Cool cats from philly."
5,After about 1 1/2 year.,"Great printer. I do use cheap ink. most of my black cartridge cost me less than $1 each.until one day my blank print head was clogged. i even try to wipe the black print head with alcohol. it didnt help. i couldn't fix it.After Thanksgiving 2005, I was going to buy a new printer & throw my mp360 away. after doing alot of research, this printer had better rating than majority of All In One out there.i stumbled upon Randy Klingberg's posting, and decided to give it a shot. i had nothing to lose.i used a syringe to inject isopropyl rubbing alcohol into the empty black ink cartridge. i used it to print 15 pages at a time, repeatedly. i filled up the cartridge twice w/alcohol.the results were phenomenal!!!! thank you Randy!!!!DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK"
4,"Nice printer, another possible cleaning method","Hi,I had streaky problems after a year or so, deep head cleaning etc.. didn't work. Was in the process of emptying the black cartridge so I could try the alcohol method. I was printing solid black pages of ink (using a black filled box in Microsoft Word), and found that after one of these pages, the problem had cleared itself up!One other issue too - in duplex mode it prints black using the colour cartridge, I've updated the drivers etc... but it's still a problem. If you want to manually duplex, do it using the odd page / even page rather than duplex feature, unless you don't care about print quality / ink usage."
5,CANONMP360,THIS CANON MP PRINTER IS WONDERFUL!!!!!!! THE COL0RS ARE FANTASTIC AND IT COPIES AND SCANS EXCEPTIONALLY FAST! THE INK IS INEXPENSIVE ALSO. I AM SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS PRINTER. ALL OF MY FAMILY LOVES IT ALSO. MY DAUGHTER BOUGHT A LEXMARK BUT IS PLANNING ON TAKING IT BACK AND GETTING THIS ONE. THE PRICE OF $99.00(WITH $30 REBATE COUPON) AND FREE SHIPPING WAS FABULOUS. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 3 TO 5 DAYS SHIPPING AND I RECEIVED IT IN 2 DAYS. GREAT COMPANY AND I WILL DEFINITELY ORDER FROM AMAZON.COM AGAIN. THANKS SO MUCH AMAZON.COM!!! YOU ARE GREAT !
4,Gorgeous and sexy,"Oh what these shoes did for my 40+ legs! BUT, buy them a size or at least half size bigger than what you normally wear. European sizes are different than ours, I don't care what anyone says, and I cried as I put them in the return box because they didn't have a bigger size. They go with anything, (especially the matching purse I bought but kept!) and have class written all over them."
4,"Good movie, good idea","Maybe the movie isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it does have a great idea. Very Pulp Fiction like in the sense it follows 4 people version of the same story. It's not as twisted as Pulp Fiction, but nontheless pioneering.Salma does a good job acting, but the guy that becomes her pimp at the end is horrible. An okay storyline with okay actingI definitley recommend buying the movie"
3,A Soap Opera with a big twist,"This movie was good, too soap operish for my taste, but enjoyed the twist, check it out..3.5 stars..."
3,Your basic TV book,"This book gives a nice overview of the first five seasons of ""Cheers."" Included are three chapters on the making of the show: the beginning (choosing the location, casting, etc.), the Sam/Diane romance, and a day-by-day description of how an episode is produced. The cast and character bios (Sam, Diane, Carla, Coach, Cliff, Norm, Woody and Frasier) are fun, and lots of pictures and quotes are sprinkled throughout. There's also a short episode guide, a trivia quiz, a list of recurring characters, and a list of awards the series has been nominated for.It's not an especially deep look into the series (and it stops at the fifth season!), but there's enough interesting information here to make it worth a look for fans who don't have every episode memorized."
1,It's not working,It doesn't work the way I thougt it would.One should read the direction/discription of this product well before making purchase.I wasted my money.
5,Great cables,Great cables and fast shipping but one bad thing i ordered the wrong ones. They look like the ones to make your lap-top view on you TV screen. The only problem is they have different configured pins in the plug. Oh well it was my bad because if you look close on the picture you can see it's the wrong ones. Live and learn
2,it didn't work for my pc,it didn't work for my laptop vista and when we hook it up and try to change input on our plasma tv it didn't work so we return it and just got my amazon gift card balance back
1,Unmitigated Propaganda,"As propaganda, this is a brilliant work, evidence being the number of adherents that buy its thesis. Said neglects to mention the ongoing conflicts in Sudan, Nigeria and Indonesia where Christians are politically, physically and criminally assaulted do solely to their faith by Muslims. He fails to mention that Jordan has considered and rejected a ban on ""honor killings"" of women. Said's entire career is intended to shield Islamic ""culture"" from the acknowledgment of its abject failure. Twenty per cent of the world's population and 50% of the world's illiterates. Islamic countries suffer terrible brain drain for a reason. Said lived in the United States didn't he didn't choose to live in any Islamic country, did he?"
3,good,An excellent look into media coverage of Islam broadly. My problem was with the methodology of the book. There is no guiding theory or set of theories developed to explain the wide ranging assertions by the author.
1,Disappointing,"I looked forward to this book, but ended up disappointed. Said spent a good deal of time criticising a range of other's arguments, without giving views of his own. It read like a critical essay rather than a tale of its own."
1,A book intended to put honest journalism on the defensive,The book attempts to discredit any honest and straightforward revelation of events in the Arab and Moslem world. It unjustly portrays those critical of attitudes of Arab and Moslem governments and societies as having a colonial and prejudiced mentality.
1,Covering up on Islam?,"Is this what the author is suggesting? Covering up on the crimes committed in Moslem countries. This cover up is indeed practiced by the media. Since the sixties, more than 1.5 million Christians were killed in the Southern Sudan, and this genocide is till now well concealed from world public opinion. But the book is not satisfied with that. It urges the media to explain away terror, bigotry, and racism if they occurr in the Moslem world. He also wants the media not to report on the mysogenic attitude in Moslem societies. Is it not the moral duty of a fair journalist to report on the mistreatment of women in the Arab world, on their genital mutilation, their inferior status? The pity is that if what the author recommends is adhered to, more suffering will occur in the Arab world."
4,I bet you've never heard of them...,"I bet you've never heard of them but there's a lot of talent here. I would bet this is where the idea for The White Stripes came from. Husband and wife team playing stripped down garage rock. The songs move from hard rock, to punk, to hippie (think Neil Young. But it's all good stuff.The recording quality is poor by most standards but once you realize they play the music, do the recording, and cut their own records you'll appreciate it. In fact the poor sound quality is sort of ""their sound"" and is instantly recognizable once you listen to them."
2,Not good for problem solving,"I didn't like this textbook at all: on one hand, it is easy enough to read (with the simple examples throughout the chapters), on the other hand, it doesn't give you any guidance on how to do the homework problems, which totally differ from the chapter examples. Many of the most important rules were not in the body of the chapter but in a tiny footnotes, which you are constantly required to use in homework problems. Unless you have a great instructor, who can explain the steps for performing tax plannig cases and problems, I would not recommend this book for students who are not familiar with tax laws."
2,It is just below decent.,"Honestly, I think that this music stinks. Even though it is written by a vigorous composer, these two selections for this CD is terrible."
4,What did you do with my mother?,"My husband had this book as a child. My child destroyed it. Now we have it and I love it. Great price, awesome book.This book has awesome 70's color theme. The little boy gets to confront and conquer his fears of the basement and discovers his mom really does believe him. Oh, and who doesn't like cookies with milk?"
3,Great book! Still was afraid of the basement...,"I had a copy of this book growing up. Whether my mother purchased it for me to become ""empowered"" against my fears or they just thought it was a good book, I'll just say this: this book did NOT help me overcome my fears of the dark. They just made me MORE afraid of the basement.However, the story has stuck with me all these years, though possibly because of the terror I felt about it."
3,A bit old-fashioned for my taste,"I purchased this before pre-reading it, and was a bit disappointed. While the message of the book is a good one (conquering one's fears) the illustrations were a bit dull, the text was pretty ordinary, and it failed to charm me. That being said, my daughter likes it well enough. It just wouldn't be on any 'must have' list of books I'd give someone."
5,A Family Favorite,"I remember getting this book when I was in first or second grade in the 70's. I still own the same book today. It has been read many, many times by myself and my family. This story has become my sons favorite as well. I look forward to buying another one to retire this one to the shelf, as it has told it's story for over 20 years."
4,Kidnap the Sandy Claws!,"Harper Collins released this small hardcover graphic novel based on L. Frank Baum's original book, A Kidnapped Santa Claus, adapted by Alex Robinson(Box Office Poison). The book was a followup to Baum's The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus which told Santa's origins. In this story, Santa gets captured by some evil demons, so a bunch his elves and fairy friends(including Zurline)mount a rescue. This actually turned out to be a great comic for young readers, and I highly recommend it as a holiday gift."
4,"A Nice, Different, Christmas story","My son and I read this together (he's 5) and we enjoyed it. It's a different take on Christmas stories, and teaches some nice lessons about the true meaning of giving and selflessness."
2,Meh.,"Okay, so I know this was supposed to be a morality tale, but still....I found it not to be that fun to read, even with the personification of the sins of man, and the whole fairy-forest becoming some kind of army against them...and the subsequent reluctant hero. The whole thing read as one stereotypical farce to me. Maybe I'm jaded, but I won't be recommending this ."
4,Grest! Even for music-maker newbies.,"MTV Music Maker is fantastic! it is the best music software program on the market (even better than acid and a lot of other expensive programs). With it you can use a large collection of fantastic previous made loops, or--once your more advanced--you can make loops of your own! you can add tons of funky effects and make an endless about of groovy tunes. . .The only problem is the poor quality in the sounds, keep in mind the sound quality is still good, but just as long as you keep your song to a minimum on the number of sounds at one time, for example: Bass and Synth and some Percussion will go great, but all that plus vocals, extra synth and more advanced musical combinations will turn up a little distorted. But the sound quality is still good enough to impress your friends, or maybe to add to a video cd of your own. But, as long as you don't care about having super professional sounding music you'll love this program!"
1,cannot get software to run,"I had written a previous review about being unable to install the software with any version of directx higher than version 7. As it turns out, their customer service rep told me how to get past the directx error that would prevent installation. After that however, the program would not run. Have been communicating with the customer rep for several days. According to the info on the jewelcase, ATI Rage Pro chipsets, (what I'm running), are supported. Still the program will not run. Customer service has tried to get it to run, and they did reply promptly, but at this time I can only give this program 1 star, as IMO, a well written program should not fail to run when it's requirements are met. This program did run at one time on my computer, the only two things that have changed on my machine is the Directx version, and the video,(turned off the integrated graphics and installed a video card). It is a good program, to bad it will no longer run."
5,I Love it,Sense I'm a up an coming producer/songwriter the mtv music generator is the best way to test my skills of being the nextp. diddy or timberland. I love it an if your drawn to music like I am you should love this to
4,Sinatra plus Ella: Terrific!,"Contrary to another reviewer, I consider the picture qualityto be quite acceptable. All four specials are excellent,but my favorite is ""A Man and His Music+ Ella+Jobim"".The show's highlight occurs in the last half with afree-wheeling medley by Frank and Ella. It's almost as goodas Ella's amazing blues medley with Dinah Shore on Dinah'swonderful ""Chevy Show"" (you can see it on YouTube).And, by the way, someone should get wise and put out a setof Chevy Show highlights.."
1,Received the wrong item....,"I ordered ""deep cleaning"" 409 that ""cleans to a shine"".... I love it. I couldn't find it in any local store, so I went to this site and ordered 2 bottles of it.... I received 409 ""Cleaner, Degreaser, Disinfectant""... it may be a good product BUT it wasn't what I've been searching for... $15 down the drain... to much trouble to send it back... very disappointed."
2,XBox Rules!,"I used to be a big Nintendo fan and thought Gamecube was going to be the best. I have every system Nintendo has ever made, except for Gamecube. Now I have changed my mind about Nintendo. I think a few of their games are good for Gamecube, but the majority of them are on the childish side. I just pre-ordered an XBox. I just have one thing to ask Nintendo: What Happened?"
1,Bust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a gay system it can not do what the other systems can so it is a big BUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,not excited at all,"Anyway, read styx138's review before you consider buying this. I'm buying an Xbox now and possibly a gamecube later. I've heard too many complaints from import owners of the GCN to be excited about the gamecube. If you're older than 12 then why would you settle for a GCN? As a 22 year old gamer Nintendo games for the most part stopped appealing to me around age 15. My policy on GCN is ""wait and see"" for now."
1,Too Costly,"I have been saving money for a GameCube for about 5 months. I was so excited to hear you could buy it on the internet because I knew my parents wouldn't drive me all over to look for it. Now that I get on the internet and look, all that people sell are ""Starter Packs"" and I cannot afford tose. It makes me mad. I do like the items in the pack (the games and controllers), but there are too many items and it is much too costly. What about: GameCube, 1 Contoller, 1 memory card, and Luigi's Mansion? That is nice, small, and not so costly!"
3,Save your money for a better package,"I've played the Japanese version of Luigi & Wave Race. WR:BS is terrific, and Star Wars is said to be great, but Luigi is far too short (10-12 hours?), not much fun, and with little replay value. [They] should offer a package with Star Wars, Wave Race, and Madden... or any GameCube title other than Luigi's Mansion. Save your money until they do."
3,Ridiculous,"The game launch is a little over a month away now, and nobody is taking pre-orders yet. INCLUDING AMAZON.COM. When will the pre-orders be made available? 2 whole days before the system launches?? I have been told constatnly by Amazon.com employee's that they would start taking pre-orders on Oct. 1...Guess what...that time has come and gone, and no pre-orders yet. What gives?"
2,Gamecube isn't that great,Gamecube is not that great. It has a litle better graphics and color than n64. Overall it doesnt make a big difference. Your better of with Xbox they have almost two times the amount of games for Xbox than gameube. I would say Xbox is much better. The games aren't that fun. They are boring. So whoever wants boring games and a system that is no better than n64 this is for you. Yu cant even play DVD's on it. The console is very small but not worth $200.00. If you want to have fun get the Xbox not the gamecube.
3,Great start.,"Just bought my gamecube today and I am not disappointed at all.For those who say their launch games arent that great, there is Tony Hawk 3, Rogue Squadron 2, Madden and for the 200 price tag, you cant really go wrong with this system.The future looks bright with MANY third party developers on board(unlike N64). like Sega, Capcom to name a few heavy weights. (The next sonic adventure will be on the system.)And I think the main reason to buy a gamecube is this(besides MArio)is Resident Evil. All future resident Evils are Gamecube only, and thats more than enough for me. The future is very bright."
2,Far Too Costly For Me,"Although the GameCube in itself is a stellar gaming console (five stars), this package forces us to buy products that we not do want or need. Unfortunately, Amazon.com and many other online stores have not taken the people with a limited budget, or who simply do not want to spend ($$$)on games, into consideration. Although everything offered in this package is of exceptional quality (except maybe the third party accesories) and deserves nothing but praise, the marketers behind what is offered here believe that people have hundreds of excess dollars lying around to spend on unwanted extras. Do yourself a favor and buy the GameCube when it arrives alone, but do not spend your money on this overpriced marketing scheme."
3,Ok,The GameCube is a great gaming system. It is very strong and will turn out many wonderful games. Unfortunately Nintendo's style of games don't suit my interests. Most of their games are geared for younger audiences. I enjoy adult games. This is a great system for kids.
2,Three ok episodes,"These are a rip-off. They are fun to watch at first, but after the first time they are boring. If you really want to see them, tape them of TV, but don't waste your cash."
4,Better Than Average Serial,"I collect serials and this is one of the better ones,keeping in mind the target/goal of serials in the first place.Suspend belief and enjoy the fun."
3,Magnum Opus?,"What can I say? I loved the first 2 discs in this series and thought that they couldn't go wrong with the last. I looked for the longest time to get my closure and now I wish I hadn't. This is the only blemish to a nicely written, drawn and voice acted Anime series."
5,Great product!,Melissa and Doug products are always well-made-- we love everything we own of theirs!! We bought this puzzle for our 2 1/2 year old and she is doing quite well with it already.
3,didn't hold interest,my 2 1/2 year old boy who loved puzzles played with this a few times but lost interest and hasn't played with it for a while. i will remind it about him in a little while and see whether he is still interested. i also think it is too easy for him and that is maybe why he lost interest.
5,Puzzle,My 3 year old loves this puzzle. It's lots of fun. And I love the thick wooden pieces that he can't tear apart.
2,Great puzzle but poor construction,"We purchased 4 of these puzzles for our kids and relatives. The graphics are great and are great fun for all the kids. However, the first time they were pulled apart, multiple pieces were delaminating. The graphic on the ""nub"" of multiple pieces bent back and there were even a couple of pieces that separated completely from the back couple of layers of plywood. I will probably give these the Elmers treatment and see how long they last. We own a number of M&D toys and have been unusually disappointed with these."
3,Good puzzle but the paper can easily tear,"We liked the puzzle, my kiddo likes to play with it all the time. The paper is of bad quality though, it tears easily. Did not expect it from a known brand such as Melissa and Doug"
1,CHEAP WOOD... BREAKS EASILY,Isn't Melissa & Doug supposed to make high quality toysThe wood used for this puzzle is very cheap. The wood chipped off at the bottom of several jigsaw pieces as soon as I separated them.
3,Beautiful puzzle but doesn't hold up,"We just got this puzzle for our 2 1/2 year old. The graphics are beautiful and 24 piece size with wooden tray is great. My daughter loves this puzzle and has put it together at least 25 times in just a few days of owning it! However, the pieces stick together pretty badly, making it hard for her to get apart or put together. Plus, the lamination is peeling off of a few pieces already. In less than a week of owning the puzzle, I've already glued 2 pieces and I'm not sure that is even going to work. I don't see this puzzle lasting past the next few months. I definitely don't think this puzzle will be a ""hand me down"". This is in contrast to wooden puzzles I had as a child that are still going strong."
4,Love it!,My 4 year old really enjoys this puzzle and can complete it all by himself. I love Melissa & Doug products and this puzzle does not disappoint!
4,Pieces fell apart,"the pieces looked very good, but two of them came apart and we attempted to glue them together, but as the glue dried, the different plys of the wood shifted and now the puzzle is useless. Another M&D puzzle we have is fine and that didn't happen. Probably was just a fluke."
1,"Inspired, but failed.","This spool idea was inspired and I sure looked forward to not using twist ties on excess cords again. Unfortunately the spool didn't feed out any cable, it held it very securely. So the package says that the cable can be removed from the spool, sure I'll do that. Nice try. That spool holds it lid even more securely than the cable within. Oh, I got the cable out alright, by breaking that freakin spool apart! Fortunately the cable works fine, and was quite inexpensive to match the cheapness of the execution of the product I imagine. So if you want a inexpensive ext-cable, it's fine. Just don't expect the spool to work, now I may have had a bad one and others work fine, but be aware that this may be the norm too."
5,Respect Your Elders,"In an era - [NOW] when fake subversives abound -- it's worthwhile to acknowledge music that never considered a polishing. Clever lyrics that dress everyone down, bitter guitars, cut-and-paste rhythms that work -- this is unsanctioned stuff that still manages to make people uncomfortable. I'm no expert, but this is musical, intelligent, and alive in a way that puts a lot of aggresive music around these days to shame. Can't Lose."
5,"Excelent album, buy both albums now","I was really excited when this album came out, a little worried that I would be let down after the greatness of ""Let them Eat"", and to tell the truth I was at first, but then I started to play the album more and more and ""Who put out the Fire"" has stood the test of time much better. Like ""Let Them Eat"" all of the songs kind of blend together into one ball of wonderful noise. Excellent."
2,"An overall let down, but still decent","After listening to their first full length, 'Let them eat...', I quickly snatched up this follow-up album from the now-defuct Monorchid. And i sadly report, I was a bit let down. This album lacks the ""get up and dance"" cajun-core style of the last LP. Although it does have its moments, the album as a whole fails to provide anything worth dancing to. Even at it's brightest, in songs like 'A is for Anarchy' and ' Beard of Bees'....the cuts fall short of their debut's worst songs. If you're looking to try the Monorchid, or if you are a returning fan, I say stick with the first....this will only leave you wanting."
5,Easy reading and Great advice!,This book is so easy to read since the author's writing style flows like she is a friend chatting next to you about suggestions for your upcoming party.It is well indexed so one can quickly go right to an area of interest to get great ideas. Edith Gilbert's recommendations are easy to implement and make even those of us who are not particularly domestic look like seasoned entertainers.
2,not really drums nor hip hop,"I'm sad to say but this cd is absolutely awful, I mean I can dig old skool from time to time, but this cd is really outdated and we already know the roots of the whole movement, the songs are really boring with the same bit and sound, do yourself a favour and don't make the same mistake as I did buying this cd, go buy something else, avoid this cd"
1,The honest truth,"Ok this game is NOT for anyone who wishes to enjoy themselves.The game consists of very power abusive moderators, who also thrive on favouritism and [rear] kissing from the players.The game is rarely updated PROPERLY, The updates are usually hacker fixes but that is a load of [junk] cos the game isn't worth hacking (Stop flattering yourself with the hacker fixes)The PvP system is a JOKE. Nuff SaidCharacter advancement is a JOKE. Nuff SaidThe players that play this game right now hang around in town allday, being idiots and trying to make their [ugly] topless elves look cool (and they do a horrible job of it). And if they aren't doing they, they are cybering in private (Or in public if they are feeling open)This.......game............[STINKS].........GET SHADOWBANE OR MORROWIND, BUT NOT THIS OR EVERQUEST."
4,"Easy to learn, fun, online Role-Playing game","This game was orignally created 5 years ago and is still going strong after so many years. Many of the players who were there when it first started are still playing now. Although the graphics and sound may not be the most updated and 3D as some of the more recent online games, this game still is one of the more interesting games around. The upcoming storyline sounds very interesting and will add a whole new dimention to the game.It's chat interface makes it easy to interact with other players on the Realm, which is one of the nicer features of the game. It keeps people coming back. Some people on the game don't actually go adventuring, but use it as a chat server....this is one of the cheaper online games you can find. However, if you want complex gameplay and fancy graphics, you're best off with another game."
5,Fantastic game,"The Realm is a fantastic multi-player on line role playing game. It has the very best chatting features of any game of this type. Buy EQ if you want fantstic graphics, buy realm if you want fun, friends, chatting, and a great community. Don't miss out on this game!!! and accounts are cheap!!! w00t!!"
4,The Realm - Great at what it is for.,"First of all, Sirbenny and Asterix who wrote reviews here are both realm staff. (i.e. the oppressive moderators other poeple have mentioned) Now, Some people are complaining about moderation here, and some have been affected by strong moderation, but generally it is not as bad as these people make it out to be. They are most likely just people with gripes. I have played realm for about 5 years now, and have never had any problems.The game is a lot like a throwback to an old sierra game like kings quest or quest for glory. The graphics are similar, and play is similar. (this game was actually originally developed by sierra, then bought)Updates come sometimes.. not as frequently as most would like.Basically what I would say is buy it and try it if you liked the old sierra games. The fee is cheaper than almost any other mmorpg's, and it is worth it in my opinion."
1,"Outdated, Boring, and Very Bad Customer Service","This game is more like a free chat channel that's moderated by abusive ops than an actual game. When you get booted from IRC you move on without much regret, but when you pay $$ for a game only to get the same result, you may become angered as I have.Despite the moderation, this game has very little to offer, the game updates are only once in a blue moon, the graphics stink and the gameplay is quite repetitive and boring. Unless you have a 10 year old computer ( which can probably handle this game) and you don't mind frequent account suspensions, I don't recommend this game at all."
2,Rather small,"This clock is rather small, the face measuring only 3 inches.The numbers are dark and clear. The clock is small but easy to read.Keeps fairly good time, I have had to correct it once in the last month.We got this for the bathroom but for me (being blind without my glasses) I cannot read it while in the shower.My wife complains about the same problem.It's too small.I also would not really consider the clock water proof.It is a clock stuffed into a plastic holder that keeps most of the moisture out.Let us call it what it is..... water resistant.The suction cups on the holder have never failed to hold the clock.We have ours stuck to the mirror.I give it 2 stars rather than 3 because the advertisements were unclear as to the size."
4,Good choice; high value for price,"We bought this as a replacement for one that broke after about 5 years of wear. Face size is fine (I've got horrid vision w/o contacts in). It doesn't stick to our granite bath tiles, but is stable on the ledge. Have had no problems after more than 6 months. Recommend."
2,not sucky enough,"The clock is alright, just a clock, but the suction cups don't do the suction, therefore I can't use it where it was intended,needs improvement or instructions if there is a way to make it work."
5,Good product,I use this clock in my bathroom and I really like it.When I get out from the shower I know the time.
2,Not a great clock,Clock loses 5 minutes each month requring frequent resetting. Suction and waterproof case is fine. The hands came off the spindle after a year so I had to toss it. I won't buy this clock again.
3,Too think and heavy for suction cips,"This is a good little clock, but they need to make it thinner and lighter. We stuck in on our bathroom mirror. In addition to taking up more real estate than anticipated, and to looking clunky in our otherwise pretty sleek bathroom, it just wouldn't stay up. Every time I stuck it in place it would stay put for a week or so and then, without warning, come crashing down -- landing sometimes on the sink and sometimes on the ceramic floor. I would put it back together again (battery, battery cover, outer rubber ring, inner clock) and stick it on again. After about two years of this system we gave up and bought a thinner, lighter one. In fainess, though, the clock worked great. It started up again every time I reassembled it."
2,Stopped working after a few months,"I really enjoyed having this clock in the shower. I did not need it to be water proof, just water resistant as at most it would get misty from the shower but never wet. I kept great time and was easily visible. Then it died after a few month. New batteries made no difference. Contacts were not dirty."
5,Little workhorse,"I bought this clock for my husband for Christmas last year and it has kept time really well (except for the one time the batteries died). It has five suction cups holding it in place which do a decent job, however like all suction cups, they do eventually let go if you don't re-set them every few weeks.The great thing about this clock is that the outside casing (that covers the back and rim) is a respectable looking clear/translucent rubber like substance that won't dent your tub if/when the clock does fall.Now if I could just find a fogless mirror with this type of casing I'd be really happy..."
1,"Water-resistant, eh?","Maybe mine was just defective, but I found the claim of ""water-resistant"" to be a little optimistic. Within just a few days of being in my shower, the entire thing stopped working. A few days later, I noticed that mold was actually starting to grow inside the clock. Not on the case. Inside the clock. Water-resistant. Uh huh."
3,"not bad, not great","This clock kept great time for about a year. The suction cups never did stick to the tile, but I put it on a shoestring and hung it over the shower head which worked fine. However, now it is starting and stopping at random. I've put several different brand new batteries in it, but that wasn't the problem. All in all for ten bucks, it worked well for a year. Unfortunately that's about the life expectancy of everything you buy these days......"
2,Fell and stopped working,"I picked up one of these clocks because I thought it looked nice and like the other reviewers said, it falls down occasionally. The first time, the battery became dislodged and I didn't notice until a day later when the hands weren't moving. After the second fall, (which is scary sounding until you realize what it is) the hour hand just hangs down loosely. I had this problem with another quartz clock I had only that one lasted several years.Anyway this thing sucks don't expect it to stick to your tile despite having 5 suction cups. If you want an analog clock get the Zelco one that has a rope you can hang it with. Now I'm trying to find a digital one that I can hang from the curtain rod or shower head."
2,"Worked great, then just stopped one day","When I first got this clock, I absolutely loved it. I put it up in the shower and it stayed stuck to the tile wall for a few months with no problem. After 3-4 months, it started to fall occasionally, which was really no big deal, since most suction cups tend to become less effective over time.However, I was extremely disappointed when, after only 7 months of owning it, water got into the clock and it stopped working. I changed the battery, let it dry out for weeks, but nothing worked. In my opinion, even products that only cost $10 should last longer than 7 months! All this being said, I am going to try to get a replacement because when it did work, I really liked it."
1,Meh,"It's not a Swiss timepiece. On the whole, I would guess that the clocks are fine. Mine in particular, however, stopped working. It wasn't dropped or soaked or anything; the second hand just started ""catching"" and it wouldn't keep accurate time any longer. For the six weeks that it worked, this was a great clock. But I'll probably buy a different shower clock in the future."
1,"This sucks figuratively, noy literally!",This item fell off my tiled bathroom wall within the first five minutes. Then again three more times. It probably would have kept on if it didn't stop working after the fourth fall. The hands on the clock were stuck on 6:30 and would not move. Do not waist your money!
4,Suction Clock Works.,"This clock works great. I have a one piece fiberglass shower/tub assembly with smooth sides, after cleaning the tub and moistening the suction cups and applying slight pressure the clock has stuck perfectly. It seems to keep good time, now all I need to do is get the kids to pay attention to the clock and keep their showers short. The only critical feedback is that it could be slightly larger but the product works as advertised."
2,Doesn't last long,"I bought the clock in March 2008. Yesterday it stopped working. 2 years, 4 months: I've never bought another clock that broke so fast.With a new battery, it keeps right on ticking, but the hands don't move. When I take it out of the case to see if I can fix it, I can change it from hands not moving at all, to hands getting stuck on each other, to hands sliding around the clock face loose, but I can't get it to work like a clock.I'll replace it with something that costs much less."
2,Worked great 'til it didn't at all,"i've had this product for nearly two years. the suctions started failing so i propped it up on the counter. then the clock stopped. changed the batteries and it still didn't work. the clock hands gave way...definitely not swiss engineering. will have to replace, over and over."
2,Shower Clock,"Stopped working after only 2 days. the hands just fall straight down, it's like the turning loosened them and now it is broken."
4,Interdesign 61600 Suctionworks Waterproff clock,This clock works great! I needed one for in my shower to keep me going in the mornings.
3,Bathroom Clock for Shower,"A bit cumbersome to change the battery. Suction cups hold it to the wall but it must be totally removed from the wall for battery change. Every time you do this you weaken the grip of the suction cups. Will not stick to textured surface tile. I had bought the same brand clock in a retail store before and it failed soon after I put it in place. This is my second one and, so far, it works well. Keep the instructions for how to change batteries and have patience when attempting. Inner clock mechanism must be removed (pushed out from the back) from outer ring for battery change and to adjust time."
2,waterprrof clock for outside,this was unexpectedly SMALL I was expecting a 10 to 12 inch diameter outside CLOCK that I could hang outside on my deck near the pool area. Instead this TINY 3 inch diameter thing arrives in teh mail - I thought it was something else entirely! Disappointing. So far it is working - I left it outside in the rain on purpose to see if it works. THe suction cups are pretty awful- don't stick to anything. So i just put it on the deck glass table I have and use it to check the time when I sit and BBQ outside. batteries cannot be changed- once it stops- that it! the back cannot be opened. So put on your magnifying glasses if you want to check the time on this TINY CLOCK!
1,Looks cheap,This ring is inexpensive yes...but should not look like you could get the same quality from a gum ball machine.
2,"Low Quality, Not Solid, Not Recomended","This ring arrived with visible fuse lines on the inside and outside. It is feather light, and is obviously hollow. Not ""solid"" whatsoever. Not worth the shipping, much less the cost of purchase. Probably not .925 sterling (couldn't have it tested, as there is not enough metal mass to have it done)."
4,Very pleased,"I bought this ring as a temporary wedding band to wear during the last month of my pregancy (swollen fingers). I was a little concerned that it wouldn't be comfortable, but was pleasantly surprised - it is almost like a comfort-fit band. It is lightweight too. Excellent ring for the price!"
1,"Lies, Low Quality","My first warning was the 'Made in China' tag I saw when removing this from the box. Obviously not solid, this is feather-light and started accumulating dents days after it first started being worn. And despite the '925' stamped on the inside, I doubt this is real sterling. It scratches far too easily.Still, it did look nice at first, shame you need to treat it like it's made of glass to keep it that way. I would have given this two stars if they didn't lie and claim it's solid sterling."
4,ring review,"the ring was beautiful, in perfect condition. My only complaint was that it came a week later than it said, but may be the postal services fault, I do not know."
2,You get what you pay for.,This looked very pretty. I wore it every day for about a month when I noticed it had a large dent in it. Not nearly as pretty as it appeared on the computer screen.No longer wear it.
1,Silver Insanity BAD Company,I shopped for this ring and payed for it BUT I never received the ring> save your money and shop somewhere else. I sent several e-mails to the company and STILL no ring. Lousy COMPANY and BAD customer service. REALLY PEOPLE buy for some one else
5,amazon purchase-ring,looked all over for a ring like this and finally found it at amazon. it fits perfect and is beautiful. thank you.
5,Excellent read.,Empire of Hate is an exhaustively researched and extremely well-written study of how the Nation of Islam insults not only international Jewry but its own members as well. Even the most devout members of the Nation of Islam will have trouble taking Farrakhan's historian's seriously if they have the nerve to tackle this total refutation of the so-called Nation's ridiculous propaganda.
3,review,"The book has many good comments about the machine tool business in Cincinnati, early. But, clearly, it is a liberal publication. :-("
2,"A poor sequel to ""Folk Socks""","I purchased this book hoping for something comparable to Nancy Bush's excellent ""Folk Socks"" and was very disappointed. The designs and colourways are crude compared to the folk designs they're based on, and Lewandowski's brief accounts of folk traditions are poorly written and patronizing. The book includes some useful information on the construction of mittens, but I would not want to knit any of the patterns."
3,mitten variety,Have it all.... lovely knitting patterns for the basic and energetic knitter. The added history of the patterns make the knitter and mitten receiver know more about the mitten origin. The actual directions with reference to the thumb style info/directions located at the front of the book scared me away from using this book for my first pair of mittens. I just knit from a plane-jane pattern and am now ready to tackle one of these warm yummies!
1,Youngins,"Anybody who rates gamecube a five must be under 12 years old becuase it only plays kiddie game with the exception of Resident Evil. Look at the Gamecube itself it has a handle so a child can carry it around and I quote ""the disks fit in a CHILD'S hand"" If that does'nt give it away nothing will. Stick with a Ps2 or Xbox they both have awesome games. Gamecube has Luigie's Masion. A game you can beat in one night. So if you are smart don't buy a gamecube."
1,Gamecube sucks!!!!!!!!!!unless your about.........8,"gamecube is the worst system ever do not ge t it. The xbox is the better system. gamecube is a kid system with games like pikim,luigi mansion(looks really stupid how good can a game be with a guy with a vacum)wave race(getting old). all the game cube has is kid games and they only have 3 lanch games sad but true. Xbox has better graphics better games and more grownup games. I am sorry if you are 12,13,14,or higher and is excited about the gamecube you are sad and dont know good systems if they hit you. You are not a hardcore game player. Get the xbox you will be happy you did."
5,excellent system for ALL ages,"dont let the x-box fanboys misguide you . the gamecube is a wonderful machine for kids of all ages . you got football , basketball , tony hawk 3 (which from what i been hearing looks and plays the best on this system ) and the gamecube has exclusive rights to the resident evil games now . all the x-box has is regurgitated ps2 games . steer clear of the x-box , and save yourself a hundred bucks by getting this machine ."
1,If you have children...,"This might be your choice console, because it was designed, courted by, and made for kids. With the excception of the Resident Evil series on the horizon, there is not much to look forward to if you are over fourteen years old.The one thing Nintendo has going for it are its franchise game series such as Mario, Zelda, Metroid, etc. If it weren't for those, then Nintendo would most likely cease to exist.I wouldn't recommend getting any console right now except for the Microsoft X-Box. While I am no MS hound, I will say that if you are looking for longevity in a game console, that would be it, because with a Giant like Microsoft backing a console (finally, American competition again!) with a huge array of ported PC games, a hard drive, DVD player, and the best looking graphics on any system (Gamecube could not handle half of Halo's world because it has no hard drive), I would go with X-Box... But if you want fun for the kids, get a Gamecube"
1,GC is overrated. . .,"I have test driven the console competition and Gamecube is by far the most ovarrated console of all time.I recently playe dthe Gamecube at their CubeClub in LA and I played the XBOX at the XBOX Unleashed at the Universal City Walk in LA. And I have played the Dremcast and PS2 for a long time.GC lags behind the XBOX and PS2 in graphics. I wasn't impressed by anything Nintendo previewed. The Star Wars title, Rogue leader, although good didn't take my breath away like some of the XBOX games. I was always disappointed at the diversiy of games I previewed (the launch titles). Gamecube's games were bland and insipid. The graphics were also choppy and lacked detail of the XBOX.i was vascillating between the GC and XBOX, but the GC was such a big letdown. After playing the XBOX for 12 hours straight at the XBOX Unleashed event and playing the Gamecube both in it's imported Japanese form and at their own event, all I can say is that the GC is overrated and that I'm getting an XBOX. . ."
3,Nintendo travelling same route as Sega?,"All right people, let's face it: Microsoft is just better at everything. Get the Xbox. Much better."
1,Buy an XBOX,"Anyone in their right minds would be crazy to buy a Gamecube. No game on the gamecube got me as excited as HALO, which is a thousand times better than any Gamecube game. Regardless of what you think about Microsoft, they are successful and have got the money to make a great system. Buy an XBOX or you will regret it and feel like you have wasted the (money) you spent on a Gamecube."
1,horrible,the game cube is dumb because its for babies. the thing is purple.all the games are mario too.if i were u i would buy a ps2.
5,One small itsy bitsy problem,"If it has to do with gamecube, I'll give it 5 stars. I got the same pack, don't ask me how, my grandpa got it. But there's only one problem: You won't get a chance to play the other games cuz your hooked on Luigi's Mansion!"
3,I bet that GameCube could win over Xbox.,"I have the GameCube and I thought it was pretty fun. And it looks pretty cool, its small and portable. It has a good line of games announced for it, but most of them are not coming out at launch. But GameCube has a better advantage than Xbox because Nintendo has entertained gamers since the NES. And yes, some of the GameCube games could be childish. But that's okay, as long as its good."
5,Gamecube not designed for Younger Ages only,"Someone hasn't been studying up lately, hmm? Lots of MA titles are planned for the Gamecube, including all Resident Evil titles ( With Zero being sole to the GC ), Eternal Darkness, and lots more. Also..you can't complain about it not having a DVD. XBox is $100 ($300) more..the basic equivlent of a Gamecube & DVD Player. I'd rather choose one with Miyamoto any day. Besides..considering the laungh titles, only 2 I want from XBox. Shrek & Dead or Alive 3. Anyway, if you have lots of $$$, just preorder both at a local Electronics Boutique, or surf for hours online."
4,wow!,Any body lookin for fun buy it!!!!I got one and when school is over im glued to it!its worth the money big time!So what are you whating for BUY IT
5,"fun, fun ,fun","Looking for a next gen game system ? Gamecube is the answer.It won't play DVD's or let you surf the net, but if pure gaming is your passion I'd go with this system ... I have PS2 and love it the games are sooo much better than this time last year. And XBOX has to prove it to me.... Just from looking @ it I don't like it. It's too big, It looks like an 8 track player compared to the other systems. I don't mean technically, just visually.And if the Japanese gamers and developers don't support XBOX, it's going to be hard for this system to hang around.... So I say if your looking for a system to do everything buy a PS2, if you want a good system to just play games on get a CUBE.... Have fun"
2,Disappointed with Nintendo,"I've had Nintendo consoles for a long time and just recently picked up a Gamecube. As soon as I got it, I had problems playing games. Returned it, turned out it was a problem with the laser. I got another one and everything was fine until suddenly the screen went blank after about 3 hours of game play. I took it back and it turned out that it was in internal problem with the video card. I finally got a working system on my 3rd try and I liked Rogue Squadron but was disappointed with other titles. I finally gave up and got myself an X-Box. It worked from the get go and I was much more satisfied with the games. Am I anti nintendo? No. I'm just saying that Microsoft may be new but they did a heck of a job. Everyone (including me) says its all about the games, and X-Box got you covered."
1,"Waste of effort, time and money.","This product does not do what anything that the commercials say that it will do. I tried it more than three years ago and it made no difference at all on the hard water deposits on my shower doors, either calcium or lime.I followed the instructions to the letter, and used up an entire bottle on two shower doors, but it had no effect. I thought maybe I had just gotten a bad batch, so I bought another bottle at Walmart four months ago to give it a try again .Even after scrubbing and scrubbing, nothing happened. I don't know if it works for anyone else but after two tries with two different bottles of it around 2 1/2 years apart, and with over two hours of my time and effort, plus the cost of the product wasted, I can only advise that you save your money for another product that might work. I just wish that I knew what that product was."
1,Save your money!!,"Does not work as advertised. A $1 bottle of distilled white vinegar works much better. CLR didn't budge calcium, lime deposits in our pets bowls, after soaking for an hour. Did nothing for the shower head or light soap scum."
1,doesn't work - worthless,"This doesn't work. After days of soaking the showerhead in this, no improvement noted at all in clogged showerhead."
1,forget about it,"MUCH TOO WEAK.FORGET ABOUT CALCIUM IN TUBS, TOILETS AND SINKS. IT HAS BEEN A WEEK WITHOUT ANY RESULTS."
1,completely worthless,I tried using CLR to remove the calcium and rust from my porcelain bathtub and I found it to be completely worthless. A can of soda would probably work better than this crap.
1,Kills Coffee Makers,"The smell of the CLR never came out of our Zojirushi drip coffee maker after running many gallons of water through it. CLR's manufacturer (Jelmar) said that this only occurs in coffee makers with carbon water filters, only in rare cases. Meanwhile our Zojirushi doesn't have a water filter. Jelmar also said the CLR can react with certain metals/chemicals like Tephlon, and that this is a risk of use (meanwhile the label doesn't list any such precautions). Thus, I caution anyone from using CLR in any food or drink application since there is a chance of residual smell or a chemical reaction that could impact your food, and therefore you."
2,"weak stuff, get lime-a-way","I suppose it's better than soap and water, but it won't do much for thick, tough build-ups. A product that's about a thousand times better is lime-a-way. That stuff is miraculous. don't waste your money on this."
5,"Great Drama, Great Action","This is the best of the new generation of assasin series. The martial arts are amazing. Thankfully, they didn't overdo the gun play. There is a smooth storyline, except for the first episode which is just a preview of the series. The soundtrack is the best anime music I've heard. You won't even notice the changes taking place in yourself while watching the main character go through his trials and tribulations. An Absolute Masterpiece!!!"
3,All that work for nothing,"Starts out slow first 15 episodes and they also had 3 episodes that just rehashed previous episodes pointless.15 -38 started to climax good story and action . SPOILER then after all the running hiding and killing everyone involved in manipulating them for freedom. They find peace and are shot dead stupid end credits no explanation of who ,why and how they always are where they are before they get there lmao .Rent it"
5,this series is Wicked!!!!!,"1st off I love creative labyrinth anime series, but any way if your a fan of spy, assissin, type story such as (Noir,MadLax). Then your gana love this, totaly could be a great live action tv series. But this is only the first season there is a season two to finsh the story. This season has 26 ep and 650 min long, you will not be let down when you buy this. I truly loved this series was wicked awesome...........!!!"
5,Aubre is amazing,This is a great ab workout that improves your bellydance technique. I'm never bored while watching it. Aubre is systematic in her teaching going from floor to standing to teach you true ab isolation without unconciously using compensatory muscles to fake bellyrolls. It is a full body workout. Thanks Aubre for a quality product.
1,The syrup turns to thick goo,"This thing is so nasty!I bought it because it was pretty, but I have been very, very disappointed once I started using it. The syrup in the bottom turns to a nasty, thick goo within just a couple of days,and if the wind blows the sugar water dribbles out all over my deck.I've found the same problem with any of the hummingbird feeders that use the tray method: where the syrup comes down from an upside-down bottle into a trough with little fake flowers over it.Very nasty, and the birds don't like it much."
4,Beautiful!,"I bought this for my mom's birthday. She wanted a hummingbird feeder and I wanted to find one better than the plastic ones in the stores. She absolutely loved this one. The painting is great, and the metal flowers are charming! She hasn't put it up yet, but so far we're totally happy."
2,Interesting but way behind other guides...,"This guide is interesting, and indeed it offers insights on some aspects of travel in the region which other guides do not address. But it surely does not match the standard of Lonely Planet and similar guides. The advice is not so up-to-date as it claims, and as much as it can be funny and anecdotal, its advice is not always relevant. Maybe a good purchase for the armchair traveller, but not for whom is really travelling to this marvellous region."
1,Ineffective Mounting,"While the shelf itself is as advertised, the proposed mechanism for mounting the shelf to the wall is inexplicable. The shelf came with two 2"" wood screws. Here's the list of problems:1. The concept is you sink these wood screws into the wall and hang the shelf on them using keyhole slots. IF I could sink the screws correctly, I suspect I'd never get a good, tight mount to the wall... the shelf would always droop.2. I'd like to sink the wood screws into the studs... but the keyhole slots are 24"" apart!3. No drywall anchors were included.I'm not sure if it is easier to rig my own mounting system or just build a similar shelf myself."
2,Mediocre at best,The shelves are mediocre at best. I was disappointed by the quality of the shelves and the installation method. Due to the fact that the shelves are installed using two screws and nothing else I do not trust them to hold much weight. Overall very disappointed.
3,"Looks nice, but very difficult to hang","If you have hollow walls and expect to hang many of these shelves, be prepared for a challenge! It took us 3 people working all day to get 4 shelves hung on our hollow wall."
3,bruce lee the strongest man in the world,this movie is about the life of bruce lee it is an older movie so you cant expect them to jump 55 feet in the air but dont get me wrong the action is pretty kick @$$ ther is not much i can say about this movie ecept it is a good movie for its time. i would rent this movie before buying (but dont go to places like block buster because they might not carry it ). over all id say this movie is very pretty good . as for rating id give this a mild pg13 thank you very much for reading my review.
3,Good choice for any bruce lee fan,"this movie reminds me of Dragon: A Bruce Lee Story, however it is older, translated and bit cornier. This tell the life of the legendary Bruce Lee and stars a Bruce Li who looks remarkably similiar. Plot lacks and jumps around a bit but if you are familiar to his life it will not bother you. Someone who is not a fan to Bruce Lee though probably would not enjoy this too much. An interesting distinction from other movies of his life is the ending explaining different rumors of his death, lol saying he will return in 1983."
2,unsatisfied,"while i find this book a good read, i was left very unsatisfied. i felt there was much left out of this book that could have been touched on. also i found myself bored to death through the authors commentary on what little translation of the sumerian texts there were. while i was led to believe that this book would discuss much of their religious customs,myths, and beliefs, it touches on very little of any. while this is not a terrible read i am sure there is much better than this."
4,Really great; really short.,"I found this book to be a very refreshing introduction to Sumerian mythology.However, like the author states some of the translations are not that accurate. Also, I wish this book was longer.Besides those two things, this book is awesome and I recommend it to anyone just beginning to study Sumerian mythology."
5,Sumerian Mythology,"Great portable sized book. It contains many pictures of artifacts, ancient symbols and ancient texts. It contains the Sumerian writing system in a very organized chart for easy interpreting. Highly recommend this book."
5,love it,"first night i took this i slept 10 hours and never moved. usually i toss and turn. when i woke up i felt VERY calm. it was surreal.i just sat on the couch and zoned. i think it is the state of mind that yoga gurus try to achieve?!? i have never felt at such inner peace. it made me see things differently.i don't take this regularly. i have taken it a few more times since then, only when i have trouble sleeping. i didn't want to get hooked on it. but i like to know i have it handy in case i need it."
2,Peppermint,"I've used gaba before and had good results - I can't comment on this being more or less effective than the other I was taking. I guess the same. However, it has a VERY strong peppermint taste. I decided to swallow as a pill, not let it sit under my tongue to dissolve as I just couldn't handle that! I am used to real peppermint - I make a tea with peppermint essential oil from a very reputable company."
2,Peppermint flavor is awful.,"I can't speak to the efficacy of this product, as I've only just begun GABA. However, the peppermint flavor of this particular product is disgusting. It has a light peppermint flavor, but overall a very strong other flavor that I can't quite explain. I think I'm gonna ditch the bottle and try the orange ones instead."
4,Works for my insomnia,"I bought it for my insomnia. I fall asleep OK, but I wake up after four hours or so. With Gaba-Calm, I still wake up after four hours, but I am able to fall asleep again. It does not work every night, but it does work most of the time.I started with half a pill, then one, and finally two pills. It took several weeks, before it worked fine.Also, I have chronic headaches and it seems to take the edge of the anxiety from the chronic pain."
2,VERY OUTDATED!,"I have used this book several times for classes, but I have to keep supplementing it on a constant basis. I think that it is excellent in terms of organization, theme development and certainly vocabulary; however, I cannot excuse the lack of updating. The copyright is 1995 and since then, several countries have joined the European Union, the Euro has become THE currency of Europe - not to mention the technological advances that have occurred in the past 8-9 years! I beg Gudrun Clay to update this otherwise superb classroom tool - it's a waste to just let it sit. As a result of the lack of updating, I cannot recommend this book for the classroom. Perhaps ""Deutsch im Berufsalltag"" by Thompson Press would be a better choice. It even has a CD for the students to use."
2,"good, but outdated","This book is a great text for those venturing out in the world of international business... in 1990 that is. The content and layout of this book is very useful, however the second edition lacks the necessary over-haul bringing it up to date from its original version. Try again Dr. Clay."
1,The Title is not German at all!,"Even the title ""Geschaftsdeutsch"" does not exist as a German word. Nobody would say this. It is a 100% translation ""Business German"" into German, but is is not accurate German lanuage as spoken in Germany, Austria or Switzerland. By the way, the spelling of ""Geschaft"" (business) is also wrong, correct would be ""Geschäft""."
3,BIBBLE DOLL,"I BOUGHT THIS BIBBLE DOLL FOR MY 21-MONTH-OLD BECAUSE SHE LOVES ALL BARBIE MOVIES ESPECIALLY MERMAIDIA. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED IT IN THE MAIL THOUGH. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE BIBBLE VERY MUCH... I MEAN THE COLORS ARE THE SAME BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. I GUESS FOR A 21-MONTH-OLD SHE'LL GET THE IDEA THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BIBBLE. ANYWAYS, IT MAKES ALMOST A BIRD CHIRPING NOISE AND SHAKES A LITTLE LIKE THE TICKLE ME ELMO DOLL. IF YOUR CHILD IS A BIBBLE FAN I RECOMMEND THE BIBBLE NECKLACE WHICH I FOUND AT TARGET. I PAID 4.99 FOR IT AND THINK THAT WAS A BETTER VALUE."
2,Cheap cables for cheap performance,"So, if you're looking for cheap cables, these will definitely do the trick. The big problem with this (and the main reason why I rated it 2-stars) is the fact that you get exactly what you pay for. If you're like me and you have MANY different components, these cables will pick up interference.Yes, they're cheap and they work. But work well? No."
4,It was worth the money!,The price was very good and received the merchandise in a very timely manner and in good condition.
4,Good enough.,"These works as well as the expensive ones you see at your local electronics store. I highly doubt you will be able to see any picture quality differences between these components vs. other ""high"" quality wires."
5,Exactly what I needed -,Unfortunately it shipped TOO FAST :P - found what I needed already in my house the day it arrived.
1,Poor,"If only I'd realized that this CD is Tony Christie re-recording his best songs in a trashy ""Europop"" style. It sounds like a CD of cheap covers, not much resemblance to the Tony Christie original versions that I remember. Stay away from this CD and buy ""The Very Best of Tony Christie"" instead (ASIN: B00000DB0C). Sorry Tony, but if it ain't broke don't fix it!"
5,"A great live recording, just like the concert.","This CD comes from a 1998 radio recording at the Montpellier (France) jazz festival. It features a new facet to Amsallem's small-group writing. Both""Chanson Triste' and 'Thirty Two More Bars To Go' are vividly expressive ideas and the group (still anchored by saxophonist Ries now on soprano and alto, Johannes Weidenmuller, bass and Marc Miralta, drums) makes fascinating play with them both. 'Affreusement Votre' - which translates as something like 'Horribly Yours'- is more of a jeu d'esprit, but like everything Franck writes, it has a solid backbone of harmonic intelligence. The sound is very live and very present, with nice separation between the component instruments.2004 PENGUIN GUIDE TO JAZZ ON CDS, 7th edition"
3,great pot but needs massaging...,I've used this pot twice a month. I noticed I had to tap the pressure relief valve as it would leak with a wooden spoon until it finally started to build pressure....Now the pot handle fell off and can't find a replacement part.
2,Difficult to pressurize,"Only used it about 20 times.Now, It takes several try's to pressurize.This may be the design issue. The seal may not settle properly upon closing the lid.I will not purchase this product in future.Try fissler (German made). I have heard good things about the brand."
3,Dishwasher safe? Hmmm.,"I recently bought this pressure cooker. It seems to be well designed and works great. One caveat: I see it touted all over the internet as being ""Dishwasher Safe,"" however the manual, on page 80, says, word for word, ""Do not wash the pan, lid, protection cap with cooking times, or gasket in a dishwasher."" Gee, sounds like the whole thing to me. Although I appreciate a well-made product... I'm sick of the lies! ;)"
2,Trust it with steam under pressure but not in the dishwasher?,"I am shocked at how much my boyfriend spent on this pot! This pressure cooker is beautiful and really REALLY heavily built yet the user's manual says this cooker is not dishwasher safe! Not even any part of it! I find it hard to trust this Kuhn Rikon pot with steam under pressure when it can't be washed in the dishwasher! My mothers old Presto pressure cooker was always washed in the dishwasher, and my daughter, who is still using it to cook for her family, is dishwashing it nearly daily to this day. I'm going to ask my boyfriend to send this Kuhn Rikon back and buy a Presto pressure cooker. He'll spend a fraction of the money and get a multi-generational classic. Maybe the Kuhn Rikon is just a level of ""fancy"" above my interest."
2,"Poor adhesion, caused camera LCD to break...","This is a poor product. Caused my camera's LCD cracking at the force needed to ""smooth out"" bubbles and to make it adhere properly. Cost me over $ 300 to fix my camera's LCD that needed to be replaced brand new..."
4,Great...but would be better without Thenien...,"This master collection is insanly wicked. It has the coolest new cards, and Black luster soldier, along with breaker the magical warrior and exodia necross?! That is one sweet deal. But there's somthing I don't get. This collection brings thenien the great sphynx, an okay card except for its wimpy effect. Of course, this collection just HAD to bring the exclusive pack, wich has the same junky card, thenien, and a bunch of other losers. My suggestion? Tear thenien to shreds. Both versions. That's what I did. Other than that, its a great collection."
4,YUGIOH Cards are cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love yugioh cards because u get use your brain alot to win I personsally dont really like yugioh that much but if your good at card games or a brainiac this is the game for you ok!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.P.S The best pack to buy right now is shadow of Infinity!!!!!!!Three new god cards come there Uria,Hamon,um I forgat!!"
4,A good read for 2nd & 3rd graders,Horrible Harry books are a wonderful read for that stubborn child that just doesn't want to read. The books are funny to a young reader and is challenging enough not to cause bordom.
1,Ruins the ending of Charlotte's Web,"This Horrible Harry book tells the ending of Charlotte's Web. What's particularly frustrating with this is that Charlotte's web is a higher level book than the horrible harry books. Most kids reading horrible harry have not read Charlotte's Web yet. My daughter enjoys horrible harry and read them last year, but now that we are reading Charlotte's Web, she already knows Charlotte's fate which has detracted significantly from the story. I'm shocked that an author would ruin the ending of another author's book. Very disappointing, and as a result, I can't give the book more than 1 star (would give zero if I could)."
4,Excellent set,"I was a bit wary about buying this tv, but after reading reviews on other sites pulled the trigger. And I am very happy I did - getting this TV at this price + delivery is absolutely amazing! Great picture clarity, color control that minimizes color bleeding, and I've never seen my dvds look better. BBE simulated surround works great, too. Don't need an HDTV set now, so went with it - over a similar SONY, which was over $100 more expensive. Amazon EGL service delivered it very quickly, helped me set it up and test it. I configured the remote to control my vcr, dvd and cablebox in under 15 minutes. Another thing - the TV is one HEAVY thing - have to buy a new tv stand as the old one is barely hanging on."
2,"Defective, Right After the Warranty Expired","We received this TV as a gift for my husband's promotion.It worked beautifully for 2 years and - completely out of the blue and with no forewarning - it just stopped. turning. on.I did some research, and that seems to be a problem with this particular model (though it seems to apply to the 27-inch version as well). I believe it's the CPUIC that randomly malfunctions (though I could be wrong on the name).Though it served us well for two years, I'd warn all buyers away from this TV. It would cost us approximately $200 (conservatively) to fix this set; we can't afford that, and can't even vaguely afford to buy a new similarly sized set. This was a real disappointment. I did not expect what appears to be a consistent lack of quality from Panasonic."
1,Great until it stopped,I bought this tv and it worked faithfully for 4 years to the date of its original purchase. It just stopped without warning. I am thankful for these reviews as I see that I am not the only one.
2,Nothing great,I saw this video with great expectations. Sorry to say that the bartlett duo of Des and Jean have disappointed once again. This looks like a sub-par documentary with no scene worth remembering of. I think National geographic videos are much more professional instead.Looks like filming zoo lions instead of the wild ones.Barely digestable.
2,"Several years later, Gunnar is right.","I mistakenly subscribed to this for two long years, instead of the intended Rock & Ice. I just received the latest issue only to see on the front cover, a great photo, but one I'd seen in Rock & Ice more than a year ago! This is the second time in the last 6 months this has happened. I've been climbing for more than 30 years and there's nothing in this magazine of interest to me. I'm going to cancel it, and I don't care if they send a refund or not. Going to Rock & Ice."
1,If you want to waste your money; buy this!!,"The most ridiculous magazine you can ever buy. First off it seems to be written by surfers. Gnarly, totally awesome dude, bogus... I'm not joking ""gnarly"" is actually on this month's cover. Second, you learn NOTHING. What a shock that people who failed English class wouldn't have any good advice on the sport. Third, they are so stuck on themselves; any other sports are for the pathetic. Hiker, kayakers... are all second rate people. Basically from the front cover, you have a bunch of `adults' who are trying to recapture their youth by telling everyone dumb enough to keep reading how ""awesome"" they are. If you interested about the sport look someplace else. Although if you just want flashy photos this is a great magazine."
3,"Hello, my name is Johhny!","Ok, I got this off of ebay, and it was worth the $4.25 that I payed for it. System of a Down is the best band, and this single is worth the price for the song Johnny alone. Johnny is one of SOAD's best songs and it's a pitty that it isn't released on any of their mainstream albums for everyone to hear. The two live recordings are a little weak.Chop Suey! 5/5Johnny 5/5Sugar [Live] 3/5War? [Live] 3/5"
1,Not the item pictured,UNC - Chapel Hill NCAA Car Floor Mats (2 Front) NC LogoI purchased this mat and recieved two mats that were black with a tarheels logo not the NC logo on a blue mat.
2,If you don't sail you may not want to read it.,"Well it had a lot inspiring teamwork and hardwork ethics sort of stuff that I see in so many sports/business books, but the importance of many events was lost on me. Interesting tales no doubt for sailors."
3,Poor sound,"This recording is remarkable for the tempos chosen. However, in my opinion, the sound quality really detracts from the performance. The instruments do not sound good, and there is very noticeable hissing. This might be a good remastering considering when it was recorded (1935 for the concerto; 1947 for the Kinderszenen), but I still don't like it. If you don't care about sound, and you want to hear an amzing performance, this is a good deal for you. If not, I would recommendBrahms: Piano Concerto No. 2 / Schumann, R.: Introduction And Allegro Appassinato, Op. 92by Jando.The track lengths for the concerto are as follows:1st movement - 15:532nd movement - 8:113rd movement - 12:344th movement - 8:38"
4,Growing up in Aiken,"I grew up in Aiken, S.C. and this book is a wonderful snapshot of part of that town's interesting history. My father was a butler to one of the ""Winter Colony"" residents which are mentioned in the book. He liked the place so much he decided to retire there. The book is a fun read and gives an overview of most of the different strata which make it a unique place: the old time residents who go back for decades; the ""Winter Colony"" people (many of whose children and grand children still live there); the engineers, scientists and other professionals who inundated the town in 1955; Blacks; local workers. There is not much mention of Aiken's middle class--reading the book you might think everyone was either very rich, a redneck or a Black servant. But this is not a sociological study but a memoir of the authors' efforts to resuscitate a dilapidaded old mansion. Anyone has done any kind of major remodel on their house will find find their own problems here, writ hilariously large."
2,If I was her parents I would be upset also,"It was really hard to read about a young woman who was in love with an much older, overweight, sickly, twice-divorced, unemployed man. What was the attraction because I certainly couldn't find any. She must have really wanted to leave the Amish, but for that?You won't read much good things written about the Amish, mostly this book is about her love with Ottie Garrett and her life after she left.I hope she found the peace and happiness she was looking for since she now makes her living off her Amish heritage."
1,"I hated this book, but had to finish it!","This book was terrible, poorly written. Irene was bashing the Amish, but really she was mad at her father more than anything, and he represented anything Amish. I was just disgusted reading this book. I hated it but had to finish it, like when you pass a terrible car wreck you just have to slow down and look. Irene and Ollie are just profiting off the Amish. I am ashamed that I put money in Irene and Ollie's pocket by purchasing this book. And Ollie totally disgusts me. I wish there were pictures of both of them on the cover, though I have my opinion of what they both look like."
2,"Too much fluff, not enough substance","This book could have been so much more. While it makes for an interesting personal story, it is lacking in the depth and detail that could have made it so much better. There isn't really anything new here for those interested in learning more about the Amish way of life and the difficulties one faces after leaving it. Several chapters of the book seemed to be ""padded"" in order to stretch the story long enough to be bound as a book. For those interested in a light, easy read, it will be an enjoyable journey. For those lusting for the gritty details of Amish life, it will be a disappointment."
5,very interesting,"As someone who finds the whole Amish existence to be fascinating, I was very interested in reading this book. The only thing wrong with it is that it was too short! It held my attention. This book provides insight into the true story of Ruth Irene Garrett. Born and raised Amish, she fell in love with an ""Englisher"". Wanting more out of life and searching for answers, she had to leave behind her family and was ultimately shunned by her family and the community. Her story is told with truth and Love. A real glimpse into what is certainly a society that most of us can only imagine."
2,Moderate,The book gave insight to the more conservative Amish lifestyles but her explanations for their hard life leaves one to wonder if her husband isn't just a free loader. She is definitely the worker in that family.
