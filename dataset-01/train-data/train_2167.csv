5,Incredible performance,"Even though Nvidia is launching a new hardware refresh, the 8800GTX will remain one of the top, if not the top performing video card to have. It is expensive, and you might not need that much power, but with more and more high-def displays being used, that extra power becomes very usefull to keep your gaming experience maxed.I bought this card to complete an SLI setup with another 8800GTX. To be really honest, I did not need the SLI setup, I just wanted to be ready for the newer generation games like Crysis, that could use some more horsepower.It seems to work just fine, rock solid performer and silent like the other card I had for almost one year(same brand, EVGA). The drivers are getting better, but then, I am stuck with Vista 64, so my experience is probably worse than the average. Even then, most problems seems to be with other software, never the video card."
3,Brief biography of America's foremost antebellum general,"This book is about the early Republic's leading career Army officer, a man whose many accomplishments over a 50-year span definitely deserves a full biography. The author covers the battles well and provides some insight into period politics, but does not adequately cover Scott's domestic life (such as done in Remini's excellent biography of Henry Clay) and many years are passed by without any mention or barely a mention of Scott's activities, especially during the turbulent 1850's. For example, the book covers the years 1853-1859 in just six pages. It is gratifying to see a biography of this great warrior, but it will be even more rewarding when a more complete, definitive account is undertaken. From what material is provided, the reader is relieved that such a military genius, but political innocent, did not attain the highest office in the land (e.g., Zachary Taylor, Ulysses Grant)."
2,Deserves more in depth treatment,"Eisenhower does an adequete enough job relating the details of Scott's campaigns, but that is about all that can be said for this biography. A ""life and times"" it definitely isn't, since there is no attempt to examine in depth the political or social climate in which Scott was operating.His personal life is curiously absent from this book, as though his family was strictly a peripheral matter. I am not even sure that his daughters are all listed by name in this book. One has no inkling what ever happens to any of them, or what Scott's relations were with them.None of this helped in any way by Eisenhower's rather wooden prose. He simply does not have a flair for making a book more readable, and with a larger-than-life character like Winfield Scott, this is a shame. It would be nice to see a biographer like Robert V. Remini tackle this subject."
5,Excellent Introductory Bio about General Scott,"This is an excellent introduction to one of the United State's greatest military leaders. It is not an exhaustive account but it never claims to be one. I think this book is perfect for the military history buff who wants to find out who Scott was and what his accomplishments were. The book is less than 500 pages long so Eisenhower's treatment of Scott's over 50 years of Military service is concise. However, it highlights many (if not all) of Scott's successes and failures during his tenure. The book has whetted my appetite to find out more about this illustrous man. Read Eisenhower's book on the Mexican War, ""So far from God"" for a more in-depth examination of General Scott's masterful campaign to capture Mexico City and force the Mexican government to capitulate to the U.S."
3,"Fun, but won't be a favorite game","Kids will enjoy this but probably not past two or three playings. Gives them a chance to be a designer, but it's not as much fun as the show, and won't hold interest for long. Really seems directed at a younger group than advertised - it's great for kids under ten but too simple for an older player. Older kids will lose interest quickly. Not complicated enough."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding- Pass,"Pass on this story. The writing was awful, the plot was flimsy- too many misunderstandings and trivial bickering between the two main characters. I don't know what the author was thinking on this one. Talk about your 'convenience' endings. This is the kind of book you won't want to waste your time on."
3,Overpriced and incomplete description: SINGLE DRAWER,"I purchased this desk for my wife and she is pleased with it. However, the same or similar desk is available from Dynadirect on Amazon for less than half the price. We purchased this one because the other product description stated that only the center drawer was functional. We assumed, because of the higher price and the product description, that all three drawers on this model were functional. They are not: only one drawer works, and the desks appear to be the same item."
1,Don't waste your money,"It's an okay travel Water Pik. It has enough power to remove food particles. The only downside is it doesn't hold much water. I do my upper teeth on one fill, refill it, then do my bottom teeth. It's compact, but did not come with a travel case, which would have been nice. The charging unit is small and takes up little room which is nice as well.August, 2010 the traveling water pik broke. From Nov to Aug isn't long for what it cost and the amount of use. Can't recommend this product at all now."
3,It's ok,It was great and powerful at the beginning. Now I am not very pleased with it anymore. It does the work but you don't feel there is enough pressure . The price is good for what it is.
5,Comprehensive and interesting historic account,Enjoyed the significant day-by-day format -- easy to follow and shows the progression of the trial hysteria. Good index for finding people involved in the trial.
4,Great so far,"This book is huge and a bit intimidating at first, but as soon as I started I was hooked. The author has a way of making the days so clear and I felt I really understood what was going on at that time not only in Salem but in the world around it. I kept interrupting my co-workers at lunch to read them excerpts from it."
5,Interesting book,"This is an interesting book. It gives a lot of background, and it seems very well researched. I am reading it from a historical perspective. I don't really know much about witchcraft, so I can't comment on that regard. I do like it as a historical read."
3,dvd missing !!!,"The first half of this movie was very good and very scary. However, after about 2 hours everyone who is a witch gets rounded up and the DVD ends. At least I know how it turns out. Evidently I am missing a disc."
4,Peugot Pepper Mill,Easy to load and control coarseness of grind. Excellent finish - looks and performs well.
2,"Looks good, works poorly","We have been using this mill for about 4 months, and it looks great on the table, but that's about it. It will grind pepper, but adjusting it is very hit-and-miss (mostly miss), and it won't hold an adjustment very well. On a fine setting, it works OK, but it is nearly impossible to get a coarse grind out of it - it seems to go from fine to medium, and then to too open to grind at all. We got better results out of a 20-year old no-name pepper mill. I would not buy this mill again."
4,Good little mill,"Mill was shipped promptly and arrived unscathed. It functions properly, quite well in fact, and will do well at replacing our old Peugeot mill which was quite worn out."
5,Perfect Peppermill,"I have been looking for the perfect peppermill for nearly four years, and the Peugeot Paris Peppermill has allowed me to end my search. The size and weight of the mill provides for a 5-star restaurant feel while entertaining at home. Additionally the grind of the peppercorns provides just the right balance between the dust you can buy off the shelf in a grocery store and the grainy chunks I've gotten from other mills. This perfect grind prevents the pepper from overpowering the taste of the food. This truly is the perfect peppermill."
4,Love this pepper mill!,"I've been wanting a Peugeot pepper mill for a while ever since I saw/used one at a friend's house. I have a no-name wooden pepper mill that is nice and functional and does great with large chunks of pepper for cooking, but will not grind superfine dinner-table grinds of pepper. The Peugeot is fabulous for the small/fine grind that is appropriate for the dinner table. I also bought the 9"" one, which is a little easier to handle when grinding pepper over a dinner plate! :)The only reason I don't give it a full five stars is that the top adjustment knob tends to work loose and give you a coarser grind. You have to tighten it down periodically (after a dozen or so grinds) to continue getting the nice fine pepper grind. It's a small inconvenience for an otherwise fabulous pepper grinder."
4,Appropriately titled album!,"I recently purchased the anime, Ai Yori Aoshi and it's sequel series Ai Yori Aoshi Enishi. I've fallen in love with the music, especially, Eternal Flower. I recently attended the AnimeBoston Convention and was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that Yoko Ishida was present and would be performing. I was simply blown away as she opened up her performance with Eternal Flower. I could not believe how perfect she sounded live. It just gave strengthened evidence of her singing talent.She truly has a sweet angelic voice that matches well with the musical pieces she uses. She can easily sing the catchy upbeat tunes like ""Sugar Baby Love"" or more moving emotional pieces like ""Thankful"". I tend to love more of the slow emotional pieces and can't say enough about her captivating voice. This album does mix things up well with both types. Highly recommended for any fan, anime-related or not."
4,Enjoyable!,"Yoko Ishida's music is fun! No great elaboration on my part. Her voice and the accompanying music create a pleasent relaxing atmosphere. I might not understand all the words, but there is a cheerfulness to the sound that lightens the office or home. BUY IT! YOU'LL LIKE IT!"
5,Very Moving,"Since I am of Lithuanian decent, I gravitated toward this book as soon as I saw it.But anyone who wants to read about how things really were for the people of eastern Europe during that time would learn a lot.How families were separated, how innocent people were tortured, and how cruel the Communists really were. It disturbs me to hear how the present generation looks at Russia as such a nice and innocent country. A lot of the history is being hidden from us now; and a lot of horrible things are still going on. But we never hear about it."
2,Boring Beethoven?,"Kurt Masur recorded some excellant Beethoven with Liepzig. Why was it done again and in New York? His approach is for the most part good and serves the music well. I'm not so sure of the ocherstra however. The playing is ok...but the sound doesnt seem unified and sections of the orchestra disjointed from one another. If doing a piece like this symphony, it should be an event and the ensemble should be together in all respects.My choices for this symphony would be Karajan. If wanting an american orchestra then get Szell/Cleveland."

2,Disregard what the Penguin Guide says about this recording,"The Penguin Guide gave this recording the full three stars, plus, the covetted rosette, and boy howdy, they must have heard a completely different recording. A lot of the symphony sounds strange in this interpretation. I think this was recorded in about 1993 but sounds terrible sonically, like it was recorded in the 50's or something. I don't have the issue that has a picture of Masur on the cover but the Warner Apex version (I'm not sure if the one with Masur on the cover is any better sonically but I doubt it). Just buy his Leipzig recordings from earlier in his career. STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS AS YOU CAN."
5,probably the only Anthro book to make you laugh...,"the disparity between prof. kulick's earnestness towards his subjects and their bleak, frightening world make for great, grand humor, however unintentional. though i have some reservations about kulick's lack of scientific conclusions, i applaud his efforts. i found the descriptions (& gasp, photos!) of the travestis shooting industrial sillicon into their ahem, ""pundas"" memorable.throughout the book i kept wondering what did the prostitutes think of Kulick? The author gives a few clues, but jezzus!"
1,Another book equating transgenderism with prostitution,"The editorial review says it all: ""In fact, this may be the most readable and engaging study of transgenderism!"" THIS BOOK IS NOT A STUDY OF TRANSGENDERISM. It is a study of TRANSGENDER PROSTITUTION. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING.And anyway, haven't we written enough about transsexual hookers? Possibly an interesting subject, but how about the TS lawyers, doctors and scientists? Give us a break! Make some effort, skip over the easy score! Please!"
1,"Got the wrong item, seller doesn't reply","I ordered an ""ALTERNATIVE"" mount kit for a TomTom One GPS. What I got was an ""ADDITIONAL"" mount kit for a TomTom Go GPS. Completely useless to me. I sent a request for swapping the wrong product for the right one (their mistake, not mine). Seller doesn't reply, and I'm stuck with the wrong product. Seller has my money... I'm not happy. My advice - Stay clear of this vendor (Midway Auto Supply, Inc.)"
3,NOT WHAT I HAD HOPED FOR,"I bought this model to replace an old aluminum coffee urn, I had for many years, that had started to brew over and over again after the initial start brew.The new 30 cup SS coffee urn I have recently bought does the same thing.It also splashes coffee from the spout until more than half empty, then pours well.The removable components are not dishwasher safe.I will not buy this model again."
4,Good Charger,"This is a good little charger, amazingly small. Lots of handy features. I appreciate the cord storage, so it makes a neat, uncluttered appearance sitting on the shelf. The only downside ... it's CHINESE ! Never thought there would be any Chinese named Shumacher .... more off-shore sourcing at work. Mike G."
1,Doesn't Jump start,I found two problems with this item: (1) The instruction booklet is unintelligible to the average person; (2) Neither I nor my car savvy friend were able to jump start a lawn tractor battery (although his 15-year-old Schumacher charger worked perfectly). I'm glad I purchased through Amazon since they took the product back and credited my account without any difficulties.
2,No Good,"The concept of this charger is great, and it even works excellent when it actually works. I used it about 10 times, and the display ""froze"" 5 out of the 10 times. Basically, say the display says the battery is at 60 percent charge, it stays at 60. So, i returned it to Amazon (5 star return policy by the way) and bought the Schumacher SC-10030A. Which i could not be more happy with. It does everything a big old school wheeled charger can do."
4,battery charger,"the charger worked great. it's only flaw is it needs a high amperage boots. my battery was completely dead and i had to use my old charger which had a 50 amp boost. this put enough life in the battery for the 1000a to see a charge and Finnish the job. my old charger wouldn't charge the battery any more but the boost portion still worked, thank goodness. i also use it to maintain the battery as this car sits most of the time."
4,Works Well. Easy to use,"Good instructions, easy to use and works very well. Better than the old non digital charger I have used before. Relatively small in size and light in weight."
5,Battery Charger,Very easy to use and works well. Recommend to anyone needing a multifunction charger.
2,Big issue with this charger,"I used it to charge my deep cycle battery on my sailboat. In order to charge you need to push a button to set it to 10A deep cycle battery. Big issues:1- if the electrical cord disconnects it resets to the normal setting/lower amps charge and it starts RAPIDLY discharging my battery2- if you leave the charge connected to the battery and you disconnect the charger from the AC outlet, the charger starts draining the electricity from the battery, I guess trying to stay on.=> often left the dock and the battery was dead a few minutes later because of #2 problem. I broke 2 batteries already because of this, as they kept being drained by the charger for days until I came to find it dead. After paying for 2 new batteries I finally understood the problem."
1,did not work. i have returned this item.,this charger came on and showed cond. of battery but would never charge. i changed every connection several times and even bought a new extension wire thinking the old wire might be faulty. i also tried it on another battery that i knew was ok. still did not work. i mailed it back to amazon yesterday.
4,small but seems to work,"the shipping time as always with amazon was short. i like how they always get the product to me quick. when i received the charger and opened the box, i was amazed at the small size. i thought maybe i'd ordered a charger for my cell phone. not that small...but it is small. i didn't read the size listings when i ordered. i've used it twice this winter to keep my deep cycle batteries charged. it works. so, i guess in this case, size doesn't matter."
5,Great charger,This charger in my shop has been renamed to the Smart Charger! Is is great as it lets u test batteries. it also has a nice feature that lets u choose the amperage from 2-12 which i find very handy when faced with an odd sized battery.I would very confidently recommend this charger to friends and strangers alike!!
4,Schumacher SSC-1000A battery charger,Excellent charger that meets today's batteries. ie: can switch between regular (acid) or gel batteries along with excellent monitoring and testing.
4,Schumacher SSC-1000A review,"I bought this charger to help maintain batteries for my for my small (2w) solar system that I use for backup power. We don't always get full sun days in Massachusetts. I charge Gel, AGM, and a couple of standard maintenance free batteries that were my `learner' batteries. The charger has a switch for charging each of these types. I usually use the 6 amp charge setting because my batteries are all under 35 ah. The charger works well, first giving an estimated % charge of the battery, and then charging when you press the appropriate switch settings. The desulfating mode is a bonus that I have not needed yet. I love it but everyone who has seen/heard it complains about the noise - a constant fan noise with clicking sounds every so often. A friend who borrowed it wished that it had an on/off button but it starts when you plug it in. Five stars from me but only four because of the noise."
1,I have to return this,"I hooked this up to my brand new 100AH AGM battery, and noticed that it charges at /way/ too high of a voltage.At 15A/10A in AGM mode nearing 100% charge, the charger was showing 15V. As it hit float charge, it should have done the opposite; 13.5V.15V is above the maximum charge current recommended for AGMs in general and specifically this battery's specs (Exide Megacycle here on Amazon). For every .5V overcharged, there is massive long term battery life loss (20-40% for consistently overcharging it by 1V).I noticed the battery was ever-so slightly venting gas (hissing sound) which confirms that it was charging beyond the specs of AGM.Beware! It is not ""smart"" - it will work to charge from XX% to 90% but beyond that, UNPLUG IT! 15V will completely damage your AGM."
3,Worked very well,"I successfully charged a car battery using it. It was very easy to tell when the charge was complete as well as if there were problems. The diagnosis of those problems were a little hard to decipher. The manual is not written well and the error codes displayed on the device are not in the manual. I had to search for the information on the web. Once I found the information, it wasn't any more helpful although they do offer an 800 number if you need assistance. However, the hours were inconvenientThe process was initially frustrating because the error did not occur for about 3 hours into the charge. I finally slowed down and hooked up the battery *before* plugging in the unit. It would only successfully charge the battery when this was done. Overall, this is a great product. However, the documentation could be more clearly written."
4,works well,"i like the 'percent charged' display as it gives a good indication of where you are in the charge cycle. the AMPs settings are small and hard to read. the unit turns off when pressing the AMPs button if it's been on for a few minutes and the button has to be pressed a few more times to start charging again. overall, the unit is well made and the battery clamps are good for a charger in this price range."
5,Excellent Product!,Convenient and easy to use right out of the box...........Displays are bright and easy to read.....Good overall design........
5,Schumacher SSC-1000A auto battery charger,The chager was shipped very quickly. I used it immediately. A neighbor told me not expect over 60 -70% charge. He was wrong. It charged to 100% and my truck finally started.
2,Missing the One song I want,"I rate this low, because I didn't know the name of the song that plays at the end credits.It's Ningyo HimeAnd it's not on this disk.That was the only song I wanted, and so for me it was a waste.Let Me Be With Youis on this one, and that's the opening credits. Not as good, but ok.The other ending song is on this one too, and it's an ok song.I'm mostly just disappointed that the one song isn't on here."
1,Horrible,"The only people who will like this cd are the people still under the delusion that Chobits is a great anime. the music on this cd is too simplistic and annoying. it's very pop like. but bad pop, as in japanese pop. it's just to happy and campy. i don't like the jazz like songs with the ""ba ba ba"" singers. if your looking for a cd that sounds like it's been made by an airhead this is the one for you."
3,Excellent if you are not a novice!,"Of course Jerry Douglas makes playing the Dobro look easy in his video clips on Youtube etc. But the Dobro is not an easy instrument. I have been playing stringed instruments for over 30 years and the Dobro is one of the hardest to get a handle on because of the ""open"" tunings. I would not recommend this DVD for somebody who needs to learn the basics. I would have been better off learning the scales etc. out of a book...You need a teacher who will show you the basic things like how to properly tune, dampen, and scales....Where is Mel Bay when you need him!"
1,Paid over $87 for a $21 DVD and then found out it was defective!,"I stupidly ordered this DVD with ""one click"" because I have often done that with paperbacks in the past although I live in Thailand and the postage was always minimal. I figured that since this DVD weighs even less than a book, there would carry a similar postage charge. I should have checked the shipping cost before ordering. When I later did, I found out I was being billed 86.63. for a 20 buck item. They must have sent it around the world twice. When the DVD finally did arrive, it was defective!!! 2 tracks freeze, break up and are unwatchable. I'm too disgusted to go through the hassle of sending it back. Live and learn. My own stupidity. This is not the first time I have bamboozled myself while trying to order from Amazon. Just sending this as a warning to others who live overseas. Always check the postage before hitting one click!"
5,great purchase,My hubby is trying to learn to play dobro. This went along with his anniversay present. He was thrilled to receive it as he loves Jerry Douglas
3,Not what I expected,The video quality sucks. It was made around 1989 even though the cover picture looks more new. Its almost useless to watch his fingers. In the video vs tablature they are a few spots where they are not the same. He gives a lot of information on chords and how to do things. He teaches two full songs with tablature. I think this is more for a person starting out or someone wanting to learn to proper way to pick each chord. He plays four songs but only two he teaches and one is worth learning.
5,it helped me,It definitely helps you understand the concepts of finance. I got hooked on these back in high school. I still think they're rather relevant. The presentation is a bit on the... strange side. It's the strangeness that makes it stick for you.
3,Good but too funny,The DVD is good and material presented is useful but there is unnecessary fun and caricatures.This can be good for children may be.
2,superficial,"This book is really a collection of superficial open-ended essays on various topics, and the author does not develop or defend any central thesis or explanation of his personal life philosophy. He also doesn't include any relevant facts or statistics, which might make such an open-ended book an enjoyable starting-point for conversation. On the contrary, he often makes arrogant unsubstantiated comments assuming the reader shares his liberal humanist world-view. I often agree with the ideas, but the snide unsupported barbs are only enjoyable when read with an equally-petty and supercilious attitude."
1,Powers that Be:,"Do not buy this book!First it is made with poor quality products.It is very short, out of the 84 pages only 44 pages comprise the actual text of the book. The first 20 pages are notes and introductions. 16 pages of appendixes, mostly of timelines. Then the last 4 pages are a list of other books the publisher sells.I did find the information in the book interesting. However, the complete text of the main article has been posted on the internet by the same people. So you can read the text of the book for FREE!"
3,Phenomenal Music - WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?!?,"Of course Coverdale's vocals smoke... and the version of 'Fool For Your Loving' included here is my favorite. 'Ain't No Love In the Heart of the City' is an awesom cross between melancholy blues and metal. But 3 songs from the 11/23/78 Hammersmith show are not on this CD. Go for the CD with 13 tracks. It still leaves off one version of 'Come On' that was on the original double lp set (and the strongest version, at that) but it is more complete than this one.I'm waiting for the double CD reissue with bonus tracks- hint hint!!!March 20, 2007 UPDATE!The 2 CD version is out. No bonus tracks, but at least all of the original tracks. My favorite Whitesnake release ever!"
5,An underrated classic.,"When Whitesnake attained super-group status, something was lost. This live disk captures them at the pinnacle of their earlier period; and one regrets only that there is not a domestic release to pull the retail price down. Still, it's worth the money."
4,Wonderful recording of Vivaldi and Pergolesi,"This is a wonderful recording by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. His recording of the Vivaldi Gloria is marvelous as is the recording of Pergolesi's Stabat Mater.The recording of the Stabat Mater is quite moving. The soloists do convey the emotional content of the work wonderfully. Yet, they do not transform it into a work of Italian Romantic Opera, which it most certainly is not.All in all, this recording has much to commend it. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Price Good but very thin,Nice long net but not very thick and ball goes thru it too quickly. Probably better ones to be found.
2,"THIN NET, NO RESISTANCE, FLIMSY","This is an extremely thin, and flimsy net. You will notice as soon as you take it out of the package. The worst part is that it provides VERY little resistance after the ball goes through the hoop, which means the ball will still follow its natural projection and end up going behind the backboard, or to the sides where you don't intend it to. If you have a hoop in your driveway with a base, that means it will bounce off the sides of the base and fly into your neighbor's yard.I don't expect it to last long. It was probably 1/3 the thickness/durability of my last net. The only thing I can hope for is that it expands after it rains or that it gets stronger over time. I'm pretty sure it will just break or wear out within several months.Pros:1. Cheap priceCons:Everything else."
3,Good Value,This net has held up pretty good through the summer and winter here in Texas. We have some harsh temperatures in the summer and it is still on the goal outside.
5,Super Cheap add-on that can psyche a kid,Got a Basketball Set without a net the true recycling way: by picking it up from a neighbor that had thrown it away cause of moving. Adding this super cheap net to the set really excited my son into using it all the time!
1,waste of money,"The ball goes thru this flimsy net as if there was nothing there, poorly constructed too. Even at the low price it's a waste of money. I'll get another at local sports store so I can see what I'm getting."
4,Old School Awesome,"The reviewers that like this seem to understand it. I have had a great time with this book - it's one of those RPG books that if you read it as a DM, even if you don't play it, it will inform your play. Perfect level of detail. Quirky and ""pervy"" as we say - meaning it has it's own unique flavor that results from the meshing of the rules details and the setting details. I also found the art charming, and the design really unique and classy. The Boogey Table alone is worth owning the book for, and it lists the Virgin Mary's AC."
1,Scanned copy in 2012? Seriously,When I put this book on my Amazon Wishlist after reading about it in one of James Humes' great books about Political anecdotes I thought that this version would be a professioanl grade book. - Instead it is obstensibly a bound printout of a scanned copy downloaded from Google Books or another similar type book preservation group. Nowhere on the main title or information is it listed that this is a scanned copy instead of a true reproduction that is clearly not a series of photos from the original book. To be fair it was mentioned in the comments/description but it was a poor disclaimer that appears as if it was trying to slip by. - I hope that those who think this is an original or republication are not mislead by this and find this review helpful and will decide not to buy this version but seek for something better.
5,A great gamepad with only a few drawbacks...,"First of all, let me say that I have no regrets after buying and using this gamepad. For $20, it's a steal. The construction feels mostly solid, and the analog sticks are very handy. The ""Smart"" technology software that comes with this product is mostly useless, and all the games it tested recognize the buttons well. A few minor complaints: the shoulder buttons feel quite flimsy and don't always register button presses, and I wish there were more than 10 buttons. Other than that, this gamepad is a great value."
3,Not an equivalent to PS2 controller,"Pros:D pad, buttons and stick all works very well. Nice responses. D pad feels great.Digital button switchs D-Pad and left analogue stick instantly.cons:Blue light - looks good, but it distracts me from gamingTrigger button too soft and large - I often click on left trigger button by mistake.Not enough buttons to simulate PS2 controller - which buttons should I use as start and select buttons?buttons for the right thumb are a bit cluttered.Overall:All provided features works very well. Nice D-Pad, responsive buttons, functional analog sticks. Buttons are a bit cluttered, easy to press the wrong button by mistake. This is especially true for those are use to PSX and PS2 controllers.This is one solid gamepad where all pieces works well. I would recommend it to all PC gamers, but not to console gamers."
4,good controller but...,"I installed this controller on winXP. While I was playing an emulated game I noticed that my keyboard didn't work and there was no way to exit out of the game (alt+enter) to minimize the screen. So i reset the computer and now the keyboard doesn't work at all, must be something to do with that installation CD. I recommend before installing this controller to follow the instructions in the users manual, on creating a restore point, that you can go back to, incase something like this happens."
4,"Good, but hoped for better","I wanted a gamepad to be JUST like a Playstation 2 gamepad, and this is fairly close.Pros:Good feeling / sturdy gamepade. Works well with Madden, Has gripy things on anolog buttons and on bottom of gamepad (where you hold it)Cons:Buttons are clicky, though the more I play it the less i notice... maybe I am ""buring it in,"" and it isnt quite like a PS2 gamepad...Differences with PS2: Instead of an L2 / R2 buttons on the front on gamepad, they added 2 extra buttons on the top, and since I am used to them not being there, I find myself meaning to press the top-middle button (which would be triangle) but I press the right-top button (which acts like L2)... VERY ANNOYING!"
5,THE best game pad,"This is a GREAT (possible the best) PC game-pad. After reading lots of reviews i got me this pad to play ""Price of Persia:Warrior Within ""- after i was told that a game-pad would be much better for game play then using the keyboard.I only can agree with all the positive reviews since i dont see any negative thing about this pad and gaming is *incredible* now :)For $20 this is one of the purchases where you think ""Why on earth didn't i buy this years ago ?""HIGHLY recommended.Stay away from the other junk, especially the logitech one !"
1,Buttons too close,"Buttons are laid out terribly. The pause button right on top of the No#3 button. If you are use to any of the PS controllers, X-Box controllers. DO NOT BUY THIS. Way too hard to get use to the new button config."
2,Not very durable,The directional control broke after a few months of use. The button configuration is cumbersome because there are only two triggers and six closely spaced buttons. There are only eight programable buttons for Madden 2005 instead of the necessary ten. The price is right if you want to buy a new controller every few months.
2,"Well built, poorly suited.","I purchased this game pad due to good reviews.Found it online for $15 with free shipping so had to try myself.Its true its built well and pretty comfortable in the hand.The programming software is alright as well, not as nice asthe Nostromo n50/52 software for example.But what i didnt like about it was much more relavant.Firstly there is a toggle lock shift button.This button is easy to press by accident and since it is nota momentary button you have to go back and press it off agian.Interupting game play.Also buttons 7 and 8 are not paddles but rather thumb, and quite far from normal thumb use. I had a hard time using those buttons quickly.Also the toggle and digital buttons cant be mapped for other uses so your limited to 8 total buttons rather than 10.And finally, for some reason there was no way to invoke fight in NHL06, i couldnt live with that so i had to ship it back, and ill soon go with the logitech."
3,KC-Media Steal-from-us dot com is a ripoff!,"I ordered the Saitek P880 and received a generic PS2 controller instead, now I have to go buy an adapter. However, I read that the Saitek only has two shoulder buttons so the extra 2 fire buttons replace the 2 shoulder buttons. I was looking for the closest thing to a PS2 controller and I'm too busy to return this piece of crap, so I'm just going to keep it."
3,This is US version album,picture was wrongthe picture is japanese version albumbut this album is US version albumUS version was one track removed
5,Beautiful bracelet,"beautiful color, good quality. Hard to beat the price - great deal. Would order similar items again, thank you again."
3,Good analysis but lacks substance,"I have carefully read The Knights Hospitaller by Helen Nicholson and found it very informative. It is a historical book analyzing the Kights of Hospitallers from the perspective of their fighting abilities, their reinforcement of their defence capabilities--in other words how and why they lost or won wars--and additionally their religious stance.I would however like to find instances from the daily life of the Hospitallers in the book,as well, since they were not at war all the time, but unfortunately there weren't any. This is a disappointment from my point of view.I guess that's it."
5,Rostropovich does it again.,"This is the cd that inspired me to like classical music in the first place, and to like cello best among the instruments. Leaves you dying to hear more of Vivaldi's cello concertos (which he wrote hundreds of). A definite good buy."
3,Vertamae Recycles,"Loved Vertamae's two preceding books, learned a lot from them. But this one is just repurposed and recycled diary notes."
4,Works like a charm,"4 star for quality. Had one broke on me but it happens with other brands as well....Scary moment though. No odor, maintains sensation, all around good product."
2,Ultra thin? or ultra SMALL?!,I think these condoms would be perfect for a man of a smaller stature. And they may want to advertise for that. They don't fit on probably a majority of men they are so small. And the times I have tried them they have left me irritated. A no-go for me!
5,Love these Condoms!!,THIS IS AN AMAZING CONDOM!! BEATS ALL CONDOMS LITERALLY!! I have allergies to latex and this has become my best friend!! Plus it has no weird smell and you barely know that you're using a condom!
4,Great but not quite big enough.,"Trojan advertises this as the only non-latex condom with some ""extra room"" for those like myself who may be used to magnums or such. While they're great in general, especially if you or in my case my lady friend are allergic to latex, the supra is neither as big, nor as flexible as the traditional magnum, so those who might be at the larger end of the spectrum may find them to be pretty snug."
1,Too hard to put on!!,"Unless you're extra small, DO NOT BUY! It takes 5 minutes to put the thing on because it is too tight."
1,It don't fit,These condoms are a joke. They are a lot smaller then regular condoms and are not even close to fitting.
5,Love These.....If that's possible lol,"These are Great! I've never really liked ANY condom BUT these DON'T have any bad smell too them and they definately feel better than even the thinner ones but because of the polyurathane they are pretty strong. Also, I tend to have a slight latex allergy and these are no problem =) THEY'RE THIN, STRONG AND NO BAD ODOR. A+++"
1,Near impossible to get on,"My wife and I have been trying out different condoms to find out which works best for us. We will not be buying these again. Condoms should be tight, but these were almost impossible to get on. Nothing worse than spending minutes trying to get a stupid rubber on.So far my favorite is the Lamb Skin Natural condoms, although my wife doesn't like them, says they are slimy. She likes the Lifestyles Skyn.If you are actually bigger than average, and not just pretending to be, buy something else.If you need a non-latex condom get the Lifestyles Skyn."
5,Wonderful for Special Days,"This cookbook has been a staple of mine for more than 10 years now. While I rarely use it on a daily basis, whenever I have a special occasion, this is where I turn. From taking Dixie Caviar to work to fixing Pork Chops with Browned Garlic Butter Sauce for Mother's Day to baking Jalapeno Cheese Grits for Christmas breakfast, this cookbook always has something for me. And the personal stories that acompany many of the recipes are a delight to read. A truly wonderful addition to any cookbook collection and a great gift for others."
5,Great book!,Great reference book with beautiful pictures of lures. Just bought 30 old lures and found all of them in this book. Great buy for the avid collector.
4,performs as expected,"this might not be professional quality, but I've yet to find an stuck bolt on my 20 year old truck that this thing can't break loose. great value for the money, and has saved me who knows how much time and effort."
5,Does the job,"I use this to work on my old jeep, and change/rotate tires on all of my vehicles. I have used it to install bumpers, a lift kit, and nerf bars on my jeep. It is fast, powerfull, and esy to use. It comes with a great case and the 4 sockets as seen. I have not had any problems with this impact wrench, and for the work I do I don't forsee needing to replace it anytime soon. I had heard I should spend the extra money to buy something heavier duty, but am glad I didn't. This thing is overkill for 99% of the work I do. I am not a mechanic, and do not use it daily, but I installed all the stuff listed above on my jeep with this and it worked great."
5,Good tool,I bought this tool to install snow tires on my daughters car and it worked perfectly for the job.
5,Amazing album,"What a wonderful album and group! I heard ""Even Now"" on one of my cable's music channels and had to get the album. ""Even Now"" is worth TWO albums by itself. The rest of the songs range from good to outstanding. You won't forgive yourself if you don't get this album."
4,Flashback,"This disc harkens to the days of A-Train at Humphries on the Square in Shreveport, the home of The Bluebirds. There's no sound quite like North Louisiana Rock 'n Roll/Blues. ""Evangeline"" is particularly nice on this disc as is the old A-Train tune ""Bend Over Baby"" (we been talkin' long enough). The Flett brothers continue to make great sounds. Buy this disc!"
5,Co2 doesnt break guns!,"This is a fine Co2 product, to the reviewer who claims Co2 broke his gun, Co2 DOESNT break guns."
2,I did not like...,"I picked up a sample last weekend and gave it a try. It was ok to lather... but I wouldn't say it was ""easy"". The smell was just not there for me at all. And my skin seemed a bit drier than with my usual soap."
3,Not quite the same as before,"Consistency of same tube-o-cream that came with a prior purchase of a kit including a brush was much more lite and rich than the consistency of this more recent purchase; the cream still lathers fine but the consistency is more milky and instead of lite and refreshing eucalyptus oil ... the scent is more heavy and oddly chemical like. I don't know if Omega has changed the formula within the last year, employed cheaper ingredients or perhaps the batch of cream I received was somehow compromised ... but it's the kind of notable difference between a name brand product and a generic or cheaper imitation. Still 3 stars for lather and functionality ... after all - it's shaving cream ... but where I once thought I had found a quality import product that was just right ... this recent sample leaves me feeling nicked."
2,Not Practical,"I didn't particularly enjoy this book. The book is written by a woman in a Jewish/Christian relationship, and I would say that it is skewed significantly but inadvertantly toward that audience. A lot of the advice in the book is written for laughs rather than practicality. For example, one suggestion to calm fears of cooking a dinner for inlaws is to put so many garnishes on the plate that they spend all their time picking through them without getting to taste the food. Or else, cook a traditional dish from an unfamiliar country so that your mother in law will not know what it's even supposed to taste like anyway. My areas of most careful reading centered upon Islam and Christianity, and I can say that most of the serious advice and religious background was basic. When they say for ""Idiots"", they aren't joking."
2,mediocre,"This recording really plods along. The male voices are not memorable.The females range from unmemorable (the sisters) to whiny and nasal(Despina). Many of the songs have a very heavy sound, with the orchestra overpowering the voices. The overall effect is unmoving and unmemorable. I recommend the recording directed by Solti, starring Renee Fleming. That one, unfortunately, only comes in the complete recording."
5,Gold Bond Medicated First Aid Wipes are THE BEST!,Have read these are no longer made. This is terrible news as they are the ONLY thing that works for me. Work in the outdoors - so chigger and mosquito bites are a given every single day. Nothing has provided the relief these wipes do. I'm down to my last one. What to do now?
5,Way to good,"Okay, Chris Rock is funny, but this guy is way funnier. I recommend it. Kevin Hart has the dialogue, deliver, and body language that go hand in hand to make this an awesome DVD. No matter race, sex, or orientation, this guy is hilarious."
5,A few jokes had me in tears laughing!,"The Thug Talk joke, the Rapper joke, & some other joke had me in tears laughing. Kevin Hart has been one of my fav comedians for a long time, but this DVD made him my 2nd favorite comedian (after Louis CK). I watch a lot of comedy. Movies, comedians, shows, etc, so I'm VERY familiar with this kind of stuff. Name a comedian. Chances are that I know him/her. Whether or not I like him/her is a different story.I would give this 6/5 if I could."
5,TOO FUNNY!,I had seen this dvd over a friend's house and I laughed until I cried! I IMMEDIATELY went home and ordered it. I love Amazon already and the movie arrived promptly as always and I am still laughing.
5,Worth the money!,I like Kevin Hart to begin with from the various movies he has acted in because he is naturally funny. This standup is ridiculous;y funny! I laughed basically the entire time! This is my first writing a review for anything so you know it had to be funny! I bought the new Katt Williams DVD on 10/13 and it had nothing on this dvd. And thats being honest.
1,"Sophomoric Entry Level Humor, ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz!!!!","Fell asleep 3 TIMES trying to watch this. The ppl in the audience must be medicated or something, maybe they need to get out more since they are just in a frenzy for the set that I found to be grade school level humor."
4,"Kevin Hart is really ""feeling his craft"" right now...",This comedy special is hilarious. I will support all of his shows from here on out....
5,So funny!,This video is hilarious! Kevin Hart has to be the funniest comedian out there right now. I would definitely recommend this video to a friend. Get ready to laugh your butt off!
5,"Bill Burr, Gaffigan, Louis CK, Kevin Hart is right up there!!","consistent funniness, i promise you.funny, and comfortable to watch.anyone can watch.and he aint a ""too cool"" comedianthats important.he definitely can hold his own for a hour, two, six.his movies...not good. (probably not his fault)his comedy.Top Notch"
5,Funny little man,"I once saw Kevin Hart when he opened up for a concert I attended. He hadn't ""blown up"" yet but he was funny as heck. As he continues with his career, he gets funnier and funnier. This video will not disappoint. He tells stories of his childhood and talks about his kids and he just makes it funny. If you want a good laugh, buy the video. He's one funny little man."
4,For Everthing a Season,I will be using some of the stories in this type of book for examples or stories in my Nursing home worship services. The residents enjoy stories as part of the message.
4,For Everything A Season,"I personally love anything this author writes because he does so from the heart and actual experience, therefore drawing you into his stories. This book is a series of vignettes through which you can laugh, cry, or just identify with."
1,A lawsuit needs to occur... it's that simple.,"This ILYA is not the ILYA of ""They died for beauty.""This Ilya does a sort of trip/trance sound that is monotonoues and repetitive. Appeals to some, not me.The OTHER ILYA ""They died for beauty"" does a Jazz/lounge inspired but lively sort of music with a lot more... polish to it. ANd a woman who can truly SING, whereas Ms. Rojas (the San Diego Ilya) has a feeble, anon-singers voice that is pleasent, but it's clearly untrained."
4,I LOVE IT,"The product came on time and is decent quality, all my brothers of the fraternity love it. I am very pleased with my service."
5,Great Detail,i bought 2 of them the square and compass is raised gives a 3d effect very good quality very durable...
5,Liscense Plate,"If I have to say so, It really looks good on my Cadi. and now I need to get one for my truck. and I will but I would like to find some different one so I would have a choice."
4,Religion is just part of it,"An interesting and well researched book. This books delves into a large number of subjects, from Eastern and Western Religions, to extreme sports, and even neuroscience. Even though it touches on so many subjects, the book flows well, and doesn't lose the reader. While I found myself envious of the author's freedom of time, that allowed him to do so much traveling and surfing, I'm glad that he took the time to write this book. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with an interest in religion or surfing."
3,West of Jesus,"Good book, but starts out really random in first half. There are moments of brilliance that emerge. You have to be really conscious to find.Maybe also read Golf in the Kingdom and Zen in the Art of archery"
2,The story went nowhere.,"The book was decently written but I found myself wondering half way through what the book was actually about. There seems to be an attempt to tie surfing, philosophy and religion together in some way but it never really happens. It seemed the author picked a bunch of theories and tried to force some sort of analogy to his life and surfing but the connections remained unclear. The book does not have any significant conclusion. I forced myself to finish it just to catch the surfing stories which were ok but couldn't stand alone on their own."
2,Searching for awe in all the wrong places. . .,"If you are looking for something uplifting to read. . .this isn't it. Steven Kotler's irreverent, cynical voice seems at odds with The Transcendent Experience he pursues from continent to continent. Along the way however, he does tell a lot of interesting surfing stories that give the reader a good understanding of how it feels to ride the waves. Besides looking for Trancendence-thru-surfing, Kotler looks for ways to explain it. He does this by reading every book he can find on how the brain works and then sharing excerpts with his readers. The effect is like trying to transmit the wonder of a Van Gogh by explaining the chemical formulas used for his paints (the term ""reductionist"" comes to mind). I found this depressing. However, he does create a pretty comprehensive bibliography for anyone who wants to do further reading on the science of altered states of consciousness."
4,The Lao Tzu Of Malibu,"With dry wit and self-deprecating humor, Steven Kotler examines surfing from a Spiritual perspective, or is it Spirituality from a surfing perspective.This book answers all the big Spiritual questions in life:Why am I here?Why do I surf?Everyone who surfs can relate to observations like, ""I was both addicted to surfing and terrified of surfing."" But it's a great book even if you don't surf. I just wish my temple had better waves today."
5,Thank God for Yuki Kajiura,"I started listening to Yuki Kajiura's music over a year ago when I started watching .hack//SIGN. I know that there is no better music out there in the world. I have searched for so many CDs, but there is no possible way to surpass these songs. Yuki's songs touch my soul in a way that no other artist can and I wish she would produce more solo CDs, because one is not enough, even with all her heavenly soundtracks.If you like this album, check out songs like ""the world"", ""aura"", ""in the land of twilight, under the moon"", and ""obsession"" (to name a few) on Yuki's .hack//SIGN soundtracks. I also recommend her .hack//Liminality soundtrack, as well as the Noir ones.I can not believe that there is one person in the world who can possess so much talent. When you listen to these songs, you have no worries in the world..."
4,a note about other reviews on this site,"some of the reviewers seemed like they didn't know yuki kajiura is NOT the vocalist(s) for these songs. these songs are sang by emily bindiger, Deb Lyons, Kaori Nishina, and Yuri Kasahara. Yuki composes the music, not sings it :)ja ne!"
2,Hasn't been able to charge batteries despite increased voltage readout.,"I bought this six years ago after I left the dome light in my car (since replaced with LED!). I plugged it in as directed, with a long-term charge and a 60A jump start, but it was unable to start my car (2001 Audi S4).Six years later I used this again when the battery in my 2001 BMW Z3 was dead after a week of not driving it. The 2A overnight charge didn't do much, but the 10A charge did charge my battery enough to start the car once. The battery died again, so I tried an overnight 10A charge. It didn't work, and neither did the 60A jump start setting.The built-in voltage indicator seems to show increasing voltage, but it I guess in this case it hasn't really corresponded to the charge level of the battery. To the charger's defense, the battery's built-in charge indicator was also indicating a full charge. I guess I'll pack it away and try it again the next time I have problems with a 12V battery."
3,"Good product, not great support.","The SC-6000 is a good unit as far as size, speed and charging voltage. But the fan on mine didn't see a great many hours of use before developing a problem. I didn't have my documentation so there was not a lot that I could do warranty-wise. Buying a fan at my own expense would have been fine, but customer service was not good at getting back to me. And when they did, they were no help regarding the fan. I found a fan without them and the unit is back in operation. My idea of support is quite different from theirs."
2,too high charge rate???,well i used this charger with new diehard r.v.batteryit charges in deep cycle mode 30 amps/10 amps.well for whatever reason...the battery or the charger...........my r.v. battery only will take 75% charge after 6 charges in 1 year.could be the SEARS diehard R.V. battery.or the charger chargeing the battery @ too high amp rate??? ron
5,this is the string,Alot of my friends use other coated strings the coating comes off. The alchemy strings last and the sound stays bright for quite awile. Mine lasted 6 months and I don't wipe them off( I'm Lazy) don't be fooled by the cheap imitations. I'm on my second set and i only changed them because I got a free set.
3,Elixers are better,Someone said these were better than Elixers. I tried them out and I'm not to keen on them. They feel fry unlike the wet feel of Elixers.
1,Grossly over priced. A perfect example of excessive greed.,"A very bad economic decision to buy this book. Brief, highlighted notations; unclear charting examples - and ""Reading Between the Lines"" is a silly way to pad the book with additional pages. As are the photos of French vineyards.The CD-ROM program that comes with it, is bug ridden, and will not work - contacting their technical support is an excercise in futility. Repeated ""feedback"" messages sent - not one response.About the best that can be said, is if you were required to purchase it for a college course, do so through the bookstore - at least that way you stand a chance on getting some of your money back when you resell it to them."
2,Buy the one by Lieberman,"This book, which I used in my Economics course at NYU was sad, at best. I recommend you purchase a book by Lieberman."
1,Inconsistent is an understatement,"Even my professor agrees with me. I have taken both accounting and finance courses, and the disciplines complement each other, yet this book does an awful job explaining even the most basic economics concepts, and at times it's even contradictory to the concepts of the disciplines mentioned before. I consulted other economics textbooks and noticed that between them they recycle and repeat the same explanations of the concepts. Apparently this is a pedagogical deficiency in the way this discipline is taught; memorized concepts are useless if they are not understood, and when this is because they are not being well explained this is simply unforgivable and unexcusable, and this textbook is a prime example of how you do not teach. And I am a teacher, so I should know."
2,Overly simplistic,"Parkin does a good job of introducing the elements, and is particularly helpful with the graphs. However, he labors, generally unnecessarily, concepts that are quite straightforward. He is not very good in the macroeconomic, especially fiscal and monetary, parts of the book. More applied examples would also have been helpful."
5,Informal (Architecture),"This is one of the most important book about informal architecture.It is about how idea becomes possible reality. Instead of accept the way it is, it playfully explores the other way of merging engineering & architecture."
5,Balmond Student,"Cecil Balmond is passionate and inspirational. When working with him, you know there is something amazing happening. I had the pleasure of having him as a studio instructor at Yale University, School of Architecture. Cecil believes in the possibilities of architecture and engineering working together in ways that enhance and grace both fields. This book brings his insight and passions together. I highly recommend it to engineers and architects alike."
4,The Husbands Rock!!,"Debuut CD van deze meidengroep uit 2003. Lekker iets meer dan een half uurtje raggen op gitaar, bas en drums. Een prettig plaatje om een beetje agressie op te wekken of af te reageren. Voor mij een potentiele topper in de garagerock. Inmiddels is hun tweede CD ook uit: There's nothing I'd like more...Voor de liefhebbers van garagerock zoals de 5,6,7,8's zeker een aanrader."
1,Seagte sucks,Just lost all my data when this drive died - after less than 6 months. Give Seagate a miss.
4,Check before you buy,"I purchased this external hard drive for my laptop computer and after receiving it had to return it, as I did not have the SATA drive on my laptop. Be careful before ordering external hard drives and know what your connection is. Looked like a nice product though if I could have used it. The rating is not accurate as I never used it."
1,Burned edges and undercooked interior,"I bought this because I needed a toaster with extra long slots for my homemade bread. I was greatly disappointed in the quality of the toasting however. The slot was not deep enough, so the top half-inch or so of the bread was above the heating elements. The other edges of the toast were consistently burned, while the interior was undercooked. Overall, very dissatisfied. I returned it within a week."
1,Junk!!,This is a terrible toaster. Burns the edges and doesn't toast the middle. Wife bought it and got rid of box so no return. She tried to save us money but ended up just throwing it away.
3,Not much to it.,"This snowboard game was the hottest thing this Christmas. Every where was selling out. I find it for $20 over asking price...and thought I struck gold. It's boring. Excited that it would be interactive, and prevent the boys from sitting infront of the tv gaming, this snowboard game doesn't require that much more energy than sitting on the couch. Disappointed."
3,GOOD BOOK BUT BAD START!!!,"Jack Horne is a loaner. He lives by himself deep in the mountains. Three girls have been taken by the Arapaho. Horne is the only one who has a change of getting them back. Horne was once living with the Arapaho so he knows their customs. The Indians who took the girls are led by Red Hawk, who once was a good friend of Hornes. He looks for several months and the book is about his trying to find them. There is a lot of action and the book will hold your attention. I gave it a three because of the beginning. You are told on the first four pages how the book is going to end. I dislike books that do that. I much rather find out at the end of the book instead of the first. Shame on you Jory Sherman."
1,heavy and extra long-don't buy!!,These earrings are horrible. They look great in the picture-but are incredible huge and ugly when you receive them. Don't buy!!!
1,I woulndn't recommend this toothpaste,This toothpaste turned my teeth a weird ugly color. Never had that happen with any other toothpaste.
4,Spectacularly made documentary,"This movie goes into great details, it does not attack any religion nor make those that are true believers in the Bible feel attacked. It states facts from many well respected people. This movie opened my eyes to many issues that I did not previously see. I have bought this movie for me and have since watching it I have had others buy and have myself bought more to share with others. I do believe that this is a movie that should be seen by anyone who is afraid of or has a family member struggling to come out."
2,I wanted to like this,"I was really interested in watching this, but it was just a super dry, expected documentary on a very complex issue. Perhaps worth the watch on Netflix if available."
5,"DVD-""For The Bible Tells Me So""","For The Bible Tells Me SoA wonderfully written documentary on the struggle for spiritual equality for gay and lesbian christians. Tells how so-called christians use scripture in order to bolster their own homophobic beliefs and ""beat up gays and lesbians"" with scripture that is not even closely interpreted in a authoritative and biblically understood format.The DVD shows gay christians (and NO - that is NOT an oxymoron!) in loving relationships; it also shows gays in a growing relationship with God - who loves all people and does not make gays and lesbians to be second-class christians/citizens..."
5,Revolutionary!,"I have seen this movie twice, and both times was nearly moved to tears. In this film families of lesbian, gay, and bisexual Christian children share their struggle with understanding God's will concerning homosexuality and also their difficulties with accepting their children. The movie is most powerful because of the honesty and vulnerability of the families. The two screenings I was at, though, were probably attended by people who are already affirming. This movie needs to be seen by parishioners in every church--affirming or not, so that people know the struggle of LGBT Christians everywhere. I truly believe this story has the power and beauty to change people's hearts.Justin R. CannonEditor, Sanctified: An Anthology of Poetry by LGBT ChristiansAuthor, The Bible, Christianity, & Homosexuality"
5,An excellent movie,"This is a very powerful movie. It tells the story of real families struggling to come to terms with a gay or lesbian child. It was wonderful seeing some of the parents showing genuine love and acceptance of their childrenIt was also a treat hearing various clergy people discussing and analyzing the bible's statements about homosexuality. As someone who has spent several years studying the Hebrew Bible, I cannot stress enough the importance of studying the Hebrew Bible in conjunction with Jewish oral tradition and various other teachings. I cannot think of anything in the Hebrew Bible that is meant to be taken literally."
2,Lopsided,"I liked this film because it challenges one to think. However, I think its portrayal of what the Bible says about homosexuality is very lopsided. The argument of the film relies mainly upon emotion and opinion than what the Bible actually says. What little it does allow the Bible to speak it does so in a very bias manner. I would have liked to see some dialogue between the two sides presented in a balanced fashion. Perhaps some scholarship on the original texts of Hebrew and Greek would have served well. Overall, it challenges Christians to see that this issue is not as clear cut as they would like to believe, but its weakness is that it opens questions that are never answered, namely the title. What does the Bible tell us so? You won't find it in this film."
5,Superb Approach to a Complex Issue,"For the Bible Tells Me So is a superb approach to the issue of same-sex relationships and what the Bible actually says. It is well balanced, not only in presenting diverse points of view, but also in mixing human stories with those various points of view.I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to actually learn more, not only about what the Bible actually says, but about the experiences of people are who are gay or lesbian, and those who are their family members."
5,The Cover Doesn't Do It Justice,"I'd come across this DVD several times on Netflix but never saw it because the picture on the cover misled me to think it was probably boring. I was sooooo wrong! I eventually watched it after having reading a provocative reference to it in an article on prop 8. This documentary reveals so much important, insightful and educational information I wish my family would be open-minded enough to watch this in it's entirety. One of my 13 devout temple-recommend-holding siblings has taken my recommendation and watched it. In fact, she bought it. She was deeply moved by this documentary's content and now wishes others would watch it."
5,For every family of a gay person and every church in America!,"Every family, every church in America should see this movie. I'm not sure any mother or father, or person with a heart could watch this movie and not be moved to be more understanding and compassionate towards a homosexual person."
5,TRUE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE,"This movie is a stir of emotions. Very challenging in the area of Unconditional Love. I was angry, sad, I cried but ended with Hope and a serenity feeling of THE LOVE OF JESUS CHRIST FOR ALL. My prayer is that when I as Christian don't have the capacity to Love a certain group of people, That the LORD help me to and leave the rest up to The Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ came to show us Compassion, empathy and most importantly to LOVE Him more than anything in this world and to LOVE our neighbor like we love ourselves. There is no room for Bigotry nor HATE.Thank you to the people that were brave enough to take on this subject."
1,"Biased, Driven By a Pro-Homosexual Agenda","This film gives a very biased point of view. Scripture was taken out of it's biblical context, and any scripture that refuted the film's objectives were ignored, including the many that call sex outside of marriage a sin.If you're looking for an honest, fair and balanced documentary, don't waste your time."
5,Virtual Piano Teacher,"WB is a fine pianist and educator. His three volume set supplies the self-motivated, intermediate pianist with enough instruction in jazz theory, reharmonization, improvisation, comping, soloing, etc., to last a lifetime. Given the various costs of private lessons, a bargain at many times the price."
1,Skip This,"Nice playing, but very poor explanations. A beginner would be totally lost. Starts with extremely basic point or two, then, ""I assume you know chord structure..."" Then says that he is embellishing, and while it is nice and sounds good, doesn't explain what the embellishment is, very frustrating. Nice guy sitting at the piano, laid back conversation. I wish I could say something better, but I can't. I could also rant about it, but I'll hold back on that also...."
3,"I have to keep playing, I find the game a little complicate.","I dont't know. Command and Conquer offers more action... For this one, I need more training"
3,Old but the Rome,"Now i know there're many total war fans who have warm memories linked to the series and bought each one from the day of release and not only for the graphics. I got this one for 30 bucks and i thought its an amazing price for the amount of games i get, but as a installed the games i was quite disappointed. Shogun-Mongol Invasion have no real multiplayer only LAN and because it was the first in the series the graphics are so monotone, colorless, out date that i doubt anyone even singleplays it, the Medieval-Viking Invasion is better in terms of graphics and it has Gamespy Arcade but its no competator to Medieval 2, Rome Total War is the one that knocked my sockes off, i mean the graphics are colorfull, rich, more live, stunning unit details. My advice is unless you played this games and for some reason lost or damaged old cd's and want a full collection get this one. But if you are casual gamer with no memories for this game get Rome:TW Gold and Medieval 2:TW which are most played."
3,Total War: Eras,"Entering the mysterious world of 16th century Japan, the fearsome times of 11th century Europe, or experiencing the majesty of ancient Rome, is exciting, suspenseful, as well as educational. This game package affords the gamer with awsome color and variety. The campagne's set the stage of strategic cultural as well as military decisions and the battle engines are realistic and tatically demanding. This package should get 5 stars but for a mirade of technical problems in running the programs. Constant problems deminish the enjoyment of playing these games."
4,Add this book to your military history library,"Mr. Peters is a thoughtful and provokative commentator about war. The reader should be warned he believes in pulling together essays in this book without editing their orginal state. Thus, there is considerable repetition in many of the chapters. While annoying and somewhat distracting, it does not diminish the impart of his thoughts. He is an original in many ways in his thinking."
5,A must read for the forward thinking military person,"Over the years, I've read with interest LTC Peters' essays in Proceedings, the jounal of the US Army War College. If you have the courage to have your assumptions about warfare and the military challenged, this book is for you."
3,looks better on the box,I was very excited to receive this toy and was little disappointed upon opening it. The head looks strange and the color is off. All in All i would say that this is a good buy.
5,I've seen them all and O'Neil is the BEST,"This book deserves a much higher profile. People usually associate the Teach Yourself series with SAMS, but this is from OSBORNE so be careful and get this one. I browsed through about a dozen titles before finding this one, and can honestly say that it gives the clearest, most lucid and understandable instruction in the Java language of any tutorial out there. I also liked the fact that it covers the java.net package which is one of the primary reasons for using java in the first place. This isn't a huge book, it's just big enough with a complete index and you get more for $23.99 than books costing more. Full of thoughtful examples and useful quizzes with well-explained answers.I was pleased to see the other very positive reviews on this and hope that Mr. O'Neil is working hard on the second edition, and possibly even an intermediate book on Java. This needs to be your choice if you are looking for a solid intro to Java."
5,excellent book for someone new to java.,This book is very good for someone who's new to Java programming. It starts by explaining the very basics of the language then builds you up for more advanced tasks.
3,"Good for beginners, but..","A few months ago I decided to teach myself Java. I purchased a few books, and I am happy with my purchase of this book, ""Teach Yourself Java"".After reading more heavy, definition type programmer to programmer java books, this book has been very helpful to return to for a less 'wham to the head' over-view and tie-together.On the other hand, this book certainly won't cover it all. To learn java, you are going to need to simultaneusly read multiple books.For someone looking to learn java, with little java experience, this book is not a bad purchase."
2,Short net,"I was expecting a full length net - red, white and blue! I was giving it to our local YMCA but was disappointed in its length. The Y is usually cheap, but their nets were the proper size, so now I'll wait until some elementary school needs some nets."
4,Good durable nets for recreational basketball,"This pair of heavy duty nets was defiitely built to last. The material is very durable and the nets are thick enough to withold the punishment that good shooters can put it through. Mine have been outdors, exposed to the elements (sun and rain), for over six months and have shown no signs thay are ever going to shread, as reported with theSpalding 8279S All-Weather Basketball Net (Red/White/Blue).On the negative side, I'm not sure they properly check the ball after each successful attempt. They do the job, but not as well as I have experienced from other nets. Perhaps this is due to the length, because as other reviewer commented, they are not as long as regulation nets. But for non-regulation/recreational basketball I don't think you can get any better."
5,for such a small price increase so much better!,"very happy with this, excellent heavy duty,dont bother with $3 ebay ones get this!oozes qualityeven has nba batch sewed on to it"
1,GEEZ!!!!!!!!,"I find this to be one of the worst albums of all time (category unnessary). I am a huge Maiden fan but this solo effort by Bruce was a bad, bad dream. Yes, the first song (son of a gun)is decent but the rest of the album is for the trash. Zulu Lulu?? Born in 58?? Lickin the gun?? these are all dreadful tunes and Im sure I have forgotten the rest by now. It is because of this album that I never bought another Bruce Dickinson album. At the time I was craving new Maiden material. When Tatooed millionare came out, I was there on day one. He killed the dark mystique of Iron Maiden in that one upchuck of glam trash rock. Steve Harris and Paul Di Anno had to be laughing somewhere. Iron Maiden hasnt made a decent album since the one before Bruce made this album (seventh son). It was like Dickinson planted a bad seed. Iwouldnt play frisbee with Tatooed Millionaire....."
1,Many judgmental assumptions.,"At first glance, this book seemed to be exactly what I needed. However, the author's assumption that a bad father equals a bad impression of god, or even the rejection of a god, is her own belief. While spirituality has its place in our lives, not everyone turns to organized religion for their answers. Drew should learn to keep her religious beliefs out of writing that appears to be research-based and academic. I will pass the book along to someone else, if I don't simply return it."
5,attractive learning tool for beginning Nihongo students,"Ive been studying for 3 months now and was afraid this impulse purchase (cover looks so cute) would be too easy and therefore a waste of $$$. However, in the first 5 minutes of flipping through this, I've learned the words for ""ladder"" and ""to carry"" among others so my fears have been laid to rest. However it has only 500 words and does not include kanji --- so $10 is a bit pricey IMHO."
5,great headphones for a great price,"I got these to use with an ipod, because I don't like using headphones that go inside the ear. I wanted something simple and unobtrusive to use while walking around. They are very comfortable, and the cord only attaches to one side of the headpiece, so you don't have a cord under your chin to get tangled up in. The sound is great. For this price you can't go wrong."
4,Small,"It's small, maybe designed for the teeny tiny heads; also too simple to ajust the volume and without a microphone."
1,"poor sound quality, poorly made;","Its sound quality is worse than all the headphones that I have ever used (more than 20 at least). You are better off with a headphone that comes with such things, say a CD player."
2,"Big claims, little substance.","I bought a set of these to put on my acoustic guitar (a pre-Fender Tacoma Dreadnought) based on the recommendation of a fellow at the local guitar shop. ""They sound better and last longer"" was the claim. Well, while there wasn't anything *wrong* with the strings - that is, they sounded fine, like you'd expect from a new set of strings - they didn't seem to sound any better than my old-standby Ernie Ball strings. In addition, they didn't seem to last any longer; the ""magic coating"" or whatever didn't seem to retard oxidation of the wound strings, and actually developed a weird sort of plastic-like feel after playing a while.The bottom line: they don't seem to sound any different or last any longer than regular strings, and they cost twice as much, so I've since gone back to plain old Ernie Ball strings."
4,used book,Book came in good shape and timely but the class changed and now I get to buy another. DRAT!
5,perfect,"Easy to use, straightforward, perfect third-year book, which most people I know who have used it keep after their classes. A bit old (time for an updated version with a strong spine -lots of exercises on every subpart of each chapter and the idea of the problem words that everybody trips on (""room"" ""space"" 'place', etc.) is great. Excellent book (and if you contact the publisher--ask professors, they'll tell you--, you will indeed get the answer key, despite what another reviewer said - try harder and call them)."
1,French for oral and written review fourth edition,"I am a French teacher and live in Switzerland. I am teaching French to women who travel the world. They usually stay in Switzerland for a few years. This book is simply the best and answer all the questions people could have about this difficult language to learn! My mothertongue is French and I always find - in this book-all the particular questions people are asking me.There is ,unfortunately- A MAJOR PROBLEM with using this book. I have been looking everywhere for the ANSWER BOOK, which is the teacher book. The publisher can not provide it, eventhough it is mention in the first pages that an ""ANSWER KEY"" is available! Therefore, I wouldn't recommand this book. The exercices are difficult and take a long time to be solved!"
1,IT DID WORK BUT....,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR TEN DOLLARS AND WHEN I INSTALLED IT, I REALIZED THAT IF I JUST BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE CHEAP PLASTIC PICTURE FRAMES THAT STAND ON THEIR OWN, IT WOULD DO THE SAME THING. I BOUGHT A PANORAMIC SIZE FRAME AND RESTED THE STANDING PART UNDER MY TV AND NOW IT'S BLOCKED!!! THE FRAME WAS ONLY TWO DOLLARS AND IS MORE STURDIER THAN THIS FLIMSY PIECE OF PLASTIC!"
1,Sucked,I read the reviews however the pictures weren't helpful to tell if this would work. Once I got this I saw that it will not work at all with our TV. The front has to not only be flat but has to be flush with the On button and it can't be at the end of the flat part because this piece attaches with an adheasive! Sucked and I need to return it.
4,Definitely works for its purpose,"My 14 month old son loves to turn off the TV while 28 month old son is enjoying the show and drive my older one nuts. Eneded up they starts fighting and pushing each other. With this, it definitely works for its purpose. My little one can't push the power button to turn off the TV which means less pushing, less fighting. Also I got one for the floor heater that has buttons on the top which my younger son loves to push them and changes the temp or simply keeps pushing the power button to turn it off and on, off and on. But with this, not anymore. I give 4 star because I can see the sticker through the guard so it is not that pretty."
5,great on microwaves and ovens too,"we have an island with a microwave and an oven in it and these work great. my son can take them off from time to time, but at least they deter him a little. and i wonder if it may even be because i don't always push them hard enough when I reinstall them. overall, we're happy with these"
5,"Thank you, thank you for this!!!","This is a life saver for anyone with toddlers. I purchased it when my son was about 1 1/2 yr old. It lasted until at 3 he figured out a way to remove it and hid it someplace where we have not been able to find it. But - wow - this is really good. The velcro system makes it easy to install (1 minute tops) and is strongly held together. So much so, that even I had a hard time taking the thing off the TV (no idea how the kid did it ;-)Would highly recommend."
2,Not for clever little hands,"Our television face is somewhat curved so the velcro tabs that came with this guard would not hold the thing in place. Our 15 month-old son was able to pull it off immediately. So, we tried to glue the strips onto the t.v. and then stick it that way. This would not hold it either. The glued pieces remained in place, but the guard's velcro pieces would not hold.In retrospect, I believe that even with a completely flat t.v. face, my son would still be able to pull the guard off and push buttons on the t.v."
3,If you don't take this game seriously and you love the series you will enjoy it.,"Okay I know all the serious games nuts who sit for hours at a time playing games will cringe at this release but, for people like me who rarely play games and got this one just for fun because I love the series this game is a real winner.Being able to be in Vic Mackies shoes is pretty funny and the general theme is pretty cool, if you don't take the not so great player interface or graphics too seriously you will enjoy it but I would say this one is only for fans of the series. It is not a high speed car chase or constant shoot em up type game but for those times when you want a nto so challenging game that is actually quite playable for the money this one isn't too far off."
3,"okay, but lacking consideringsubject","so much more than any other franchise this game deserves the complexity of splinter cell and the rich environment of GTA instead, what it gets is the simplisticly linear game play of Splinter cell and a nod to the graphics of Grand theft auto. this game is good, but only for the casual gamer who enjoys the tv show and not gaming. for the serious gamer this game will prove un-challenging. breezing through levels will be an ego boost for people just getting into shooters.Love the show. the writing in the game is solid, the levels, and programming, not so much."
2,Half Happy,"If only I had know that only ""one side"" of the pendant had a design! Only one side is designed, the other half/side is blank."
2,"Okay, but not great","Although a relatively decent compilation of techniques in one place, this book doesn't contain much in the way of little-known tips that might be new to you. Also, many of the suggestions are very vague, recommending you do something ""in several different ways"" but not telling you what those ways might be."
5,Practical and Helpful,This book is exactly what I wanted. I work with lots of children with articulation/speech sound errors and I wanted more and effective tips with which to help them. Some of the classic techiques are given as well as some new and original ideas. I like the extra focus on /r/ and lateral lisps. Thank you!
3,Pricey,"I imagine this handy little guide for articulation is required in university classes and hence the big price tag. Somehow I got the idea that a CD was coming with it...no, just the little manual. I wouldn't pay this much for it again."
4,Great Resource,"This is simple, easy to use and is a great resource. Perfect size for bringing it with you to therapy. However, overpriced in my opinion."
3,Not Usable For the Lay Person,"Too much of a technical journal book here for the lay person, who works with special education students, to make much use of. An SLP recommended it to me, so that I can learn how to teach the students that I work with, how to make the sounds that they are missing in their speech. As not all special ed students receive the speech training that they need, IEP or no IEP, others must be able to step in where SLP's are not able to tread.If you are looking to educate yourself in this area, keep looking for another book that may, or may not, be available."
4,Book,"Quick delivery and exactly what i was looking for. It was a gift for a Speech Language Pathologist Grad Student, and she loved it."
4,Look in the mirror.,"I think that a lot of the people who read this book seem very pleased with themselves that they aren't like 'Those People'. But for me, the book made me look at my own character and my own failings. This book made me face my own laziness, my self deception, my own lack of will and follow through as well as my own attitude towards morality. I am not saying that I am a drug addict or a criminal or really, much like any of the people in the book. But I know that I have taken the easy path more often than I should. I know that I have lied when it was convenient and decieved myself more often than anyone else.I think that if you approach this book from a political angle, which almost all the reviewers seem to have done, you will come away from it with exactly what you want to see. The liberals will decry it as 'blaming the victims' and the conservatives will laud it as 'blaming the perpetrators'. But, if you can ignore your own bias, I think that you will get so much more out of it."
4,A physician agrees,"As a physician, I found this book engrossing, disturbing, and a bright mirror of my own experience (admittedly less ""underclass"" than Dalrymple's). To address issues raised by other Amazon.com reviewers 1) To the reviewer who points to Sweden as another welfare state with less social pathology than the UK, I would point out that Dalrymple correctly identifies dysfunctional law enforcement and social attitudes towards deviant behavior as a major part of the problem. From my years living and working in the American midwest, I suspect these are quite different in Scandinavia. 2) To those who decry his lack of proposed solutions, I suggest that the solution is evident in the description of the problem, which is the inaccurate common view of human nature. That element of human nature to which I refer is described in ""The Givers and the Takers"" by Chris Evatt (out of print, but available on this website)."
5,Written and reasoned well,Dalrymple accurately describes the behavior of the underclass (I have observed similar behavior first-hand through our local foster care system) and offers a thoughtful analysis of that behavior. He presents opposing explanations of the same behavior and shows why those expanations cannot be true. He does all of this in an engaging style that made me loathe to put the book down.
4,We will have them with us always,"This is a collection of essays written by a British psychologist over a number years. His profession led him to the dregs of humanity and the penal system. His ideas are provocative, but offer little hope for the future. As a Emergency Room physician I have had to deal extensively with the pathos of the underclass, and the fact that it is largely of their own making and poor decisions. I enjoyed the book, but could find little reason for hope for a change."
3,Data Needed,"No doubt, Dr. Dalrymple's experiences make for compelling, albeit voyaristic reading about life in one small region of lower class England. It's tempting to find in this book some comforting reinforcement for preconceived notions about poverty and crime.However tempting that is, I think it is wrong. What's needed for Dalrymple's work to represent a broader slice of the population is for him to actually study and measure what it is that concerns him.The plural of anecdote is not data, which are the result of measurements and observations. And it takes data, placed into context to make them understandable, to form information - the basis for knowledge."
1,Dickensian,"Dalrymple's argument is essentially that the poor have made many stupid choices, and that the rest of us therefore owe them nothing.Of course some people make bad choices; this is obvious. But Dalrymple's diagnosis of the problems of the lower class are based on his experiences with convicted criminals and with psychiatric patients. What kind of book would he have produced if he had worked with white-collar criminals and patients at a celebrity rehab center?Dalrymple's brand of concern was parodied well by Charles Dickens in Hard Times: a wish that the poor would simply stop being poor. Does it all come down to the individual? Well-written, but as cruel as any other social darwinist tract."
1,"A ""Jerry Springer Experience"" for right-wingers","This book contains nothing which cannot be seen every night (with a more entertaining slant) on the Jerry Springer show - minus the classist,right-wing dogma."
5,"Depressing, with hints of hope.","I lived in the UK for a couple of years during the early 1980's. I'm so glad I did, because I think I saw Britain before it went into a steep decline.Overall, the book is all about social pathology, and how it's reinforced. The stories are mostly depressing but occasionally, for example when he describes poor immigrants and their attempts to better their station, you see some hope.The key lesson in this book is that social pathology expands so as to consume all the tax money made available to ""fix"" it.A great, if depressing, book."
1,Subscription problems,"I had the chance to read some issue when I was in California and I found it quite interesting.When I moved back to my country I experienced hard times on subscribing to it. The customer service is poor. The web system for international subscription wasn't working properly so I wasn't able to proceed.After several contacts via phone and email, I sent my credit card number via fax at the number they provided. The magazine never arrived.I quit and I'm reading an other magazine."
4,More weapons then you can shake a stick at.,"The great Adam Cheng stars as a wondering fighter, caught up in a large tangled web, of hate, dishonor, and murder. armed with his metal fan, and the help of a mysterious swords man, he takes on all evil. The most variety i have seen when it comes to weapons in one movie, each character has his own personalized weapon. The characters are great, villians evil and disturbing, and the fight scenes amazing. Good film"
5,Great for the shorties,"I completely disagree with the last reviewer. Both my 3 year old and my 5 year old love this video... we've worn out one copy already. I hope they release it on DVD.First off, the last reviewer had a problem with the fact that the host is wacky and tries to fly around like a plane. Guess what -- the kids love it when he does. He's actually pretty funny for us adults -- a welcome change from so many of the super-sweet kid's show hosts.I personally learned a lot about planes watching this video. I know my kids did. One great thing is the video didn't talk down to them -- it actually gave them information they could both understand and remember.Sure the production values aren't Disney, but hey, neither is the Crocodile Hunter (which also has a wacky host). Bottom line, my kids -- and their friends love the video and have actually learned a few things about the ""life"" of a plane."
3,OK but not for everyone,"This is actually pretty dated and pretty opaque. It wasn't the approachable and interesting read that I had been hoping for. It hit the library donation pile almost immediately. I recognize that things like this can become dated very fast, the person who mentioned it was obviously a whole lot mellower and willing to ferret out inspiration than I was."
2,not the best!,"this is definatly not the best manga... i gave it 2 stars because some of the drawings are good, but some a nude people..."
1,You want a good book? do NOT read this!,This is the worst book that I have ever read. I dont like anything about it! If you are looking for good manga or anime try Fruits Basket- there are a LOT of books that I have read that are better than this!
4,Yeah!,"This disc is totally cool. You will listen to it over and over if you get it. It's okay if you don't, though. You'll just need to get used to it. ""Blight Blues"" is by far the best track."
5,Mom to toddler in So. Cal,My 1 1/2 year old loves his Choo Choo Charlie train book. He asks for it every night. His grandparents bought it at a book sale and we have actually worn the little wind up train out with all the use..definately worth the price and I'll be ordering another one immediately.
5,So Festive!,"The vendor I purchased this from sent one with the older cover, dated 2010. So I would recommend purchasing directly through Amazon or through the vendor TravelVideoStore, since they produce it. Nonetheless, the dvd is wonderful. A leaflet inside the case describes the locations and music, and each scene on the dvd has a description before the scene begins. Lots of Austrian scenes with a sprinkling of Germany and Switzerland. I would have liked to have seen more of Germany, but the content is still very enjoyable and beautiful. Lots of churches, nativity scenes, and Christmas markets with some beautiful wintry nature scenes. This would be a great thing to have on while putting up Christmas decorations or having a holiday celebration, or just relaxing with a cup of cider or eggnog. If you've never been to Europe at Christmas to visit the Christmas markets, this is an excellent introduction to the way Europeans celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. It is lovely!"
1,Save your money,This hammock frayed and fell apart in less than two months. I emailed the company and they advised me to tie it back together. Save your money. Poor product - poor customer service.
5,Good overall book,I think this book was very good at touching on all the different aspects of interior design. At times it could get a bit technical and if thats not what you want then those parts can be skipped over without loosing the meaning of the section. I enjoyed the book and recomend it for interior design and architecture students.
4,Design,"Altho the book is what it is supposed to be the CD did not come with it as stated in the description. I bought 2 books, one said it had a cd one did not. Neither came with CD."
4,Interiors,This book was bought for online university for design. It has helped me a great deal in my classes. I was required to buy it for the class. It is a very good textbook.
5,Excellent,"This book is about as good as it gets for anyone wanting to think in depth (not necessarily ""seriously"") about humour. It is commendable both for its overview of the relevant theories as well as for Critchley's original ideas. It is short enough to read in an evening, but sufficiently substantial as well. Critchley writes as well as any contemporary philosopher I've read, which helps immensely when tackling a subject like this."
5,The Infection Connection,"I'm not used to reading highly technical books, but Dr. Poehlmann has provided a list of definitions that help me understand the unfamiliar scientific terms. Dr. Mercola's suggested Eating Program in Appendix 5 is difficult to follow, but it makes sense and I'm trying it as far as I am able. The book covers a lot more than Rheumatoid Arthritis. I learned a lot about allergies and keeping cartilage and bones healthy. I found surprising facts (all well documented), for example, that people can have both RA and Osteoarthritis, or why milk is not good for you, or what is the real cause of ulcers (and what to do about it). Mold and mildew are in the headlines right now, and this topic is covered in the book, so I know the text contains the latest research. So much information for such a small price!"
5,Excellent Book on the Topic,This was the first book I read on the topic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. I found it to be extremely well researched. The writing style is straight and to the point and covers all pertinent topics.The book answered so many of my questions. I could identify with the author's desire to take control of her own health. She tells exactly how to do so in this book.I have read 8 additional books on the topic and continue to use this book as a reference. This was the first book to give me a degree of hope. I highly recommend this book for RA sufferers.
2,Evangelical and uncritical,"I was greatly disappointed by this treatment of a very interesting and worthwhile theory. There appeared to be no attempt at evaluation, at selecting points with stronger evidence versus those with weaker evidence - everything was hurled into the mix. Ewald's book is a much better treatment. The recommended diet would likely improve anyone's health - especially if you make an intelligent effort to prioritize between the risks (for instance - eat less fat (kills tens of thousands each year) versus avoid meat stored in plastics because of plasticizer migration - hasn't killed anyone that we know of.)"
3,Not their best,"I have been a Blind Guardian fan for 2 years.I have 4 of their albums,starting with Tales From The Twlight World,Somewhere Far Beyond,Imaginations from the Other Side,and my new favorite, Nightfall In Middle Earth.I listened to this album on [the internet],and I was thinking ""This can't be Blind Guardian,can it?"" Sure,there are some great live classics,such as ""Vallhalla"", and ""Inquisition,""but Hansi's singing just isn't that ranged.You can hear that German voice in his singing,where in Tales from the Twilight world,It sounds like he's from America.I'll give credit to their solos,but only buy this if you're a true BG fan."
4,To Listen is to Love,"Although not quite the Magnum Opus that ""Battalions of Fear"" was, this is still, nonetheless, a great album. ""Banish From Sanctuary"" in particular stands out as a song that was very ahead of its time, showing a sophistication that wasnt very prevalent in the metal scene until much later. Something further to look for are the first of the appearances of the choir-style backing vocals on several of the songs. Beware, however, Kai Hensley (see my description of ""Tales from the Twilight World"" for more insight into this character) makes his first appearance on vocals in ""Valhalla""; listen for the high-pitched annoying voice mid-way into the song."
2,Their weakest effort,"I was disappointed when I heard this CD for the first time and still am. Hansi's vocals are not as good as he usually is and the songs seem boring and basically sounding the same all the time. There are some okay tracks on it being, ""Damned for All Time"", ""Hall of the King"", ""Fast to Madness"" and the best song on the CD is the instumental ""Beyond the Ice"". Fans of BG should like this I guess although it is definitely their weakest effort (not counting ""Forgotten Tales""). However one thing is really good on this CD and should not be overlooked. The guitar is awesome!"
3,Almost Helloween,"This is Helloween style music, but without a great vocalist. So, though the compositions are good, the melodic parts are overshadowed. The guitars are great!"
4,Sturdy,I got this for my wife. It is a good sturdy music stand. It doesn't tip over and it holds the music.
4,Excellent product,"This stand is very sturdy and it provides plenty room to hold my sheet music. In my opinion, this product is excellent and has a reasonable price."
5,Great Music Stand,"This stand is amazing,it will not tip over and the base is heavy and the place where you put your music is wide. The stand is adjustable to every height. This is not portable however, the stand comes in 3 parts and you have to assemble them your self which bothered me first because they could have included tools. My only complaint other than the tools is that the green/purple grease they lubricated the shaft with smells horrible but only if you actually put your nose near the shaft but it is still a very good stand that i highly recommend, I'm sure the smell will go away after a while. Buy This!!!!!"
4,Good,"Good quality and arrived really fast. Easy to assemble and use. Tall enought for my son how is 5 10""."
5,"Very steady, yet not too heavy,","Very Well made, steady yet not too heavy, the price was good too, Hope it will last a long time"
4,Manhasset Stand,"I use the stand for practicing at home and thus it is not subject to much road wear. My approximately thirty five year old Manhasset stand seems sturdier. Some parts of the newer stand are now plastic as opposed to metal on the older one. I also have detected a intermittent vibration/rattle when this is placed on a hard wood floor. Overall though, I'd say it's okay."
3,Lower quality than expected.,"I was expecting the flat bed area of the stand to be a bit thicker. I have bent the edges several times since I bought the stand. Other than that, it is a great stand. Great size. Tall enough to use standing or sitting. I like it, I just expected a better quality product."
1,Bad customer service,"I received the item and notice a sharp notch at the edge of the board (damage). I notified the seller of that and requested for return. The seller wanted me to describe the damage at first and then again asked me to send a photo. Then without any explanation, ignored my request.The second reason for me to give low rate is that its stand is very rough (not acceptable) and will damage the wood floor. The rough stand surface is not described in its product description."
4,Solid for sure,"We alreday had another model of a Manhasset music stand for my daughter and decided to purchase one for my son. My only complaint is that the bolts were on so tight it took awhile to get them loosened. I don't know how my son will be able to adjust the music stand without a wrench (maybe they will loosed over time and yes we tried to adjust so that it was tight enough to allow the music book on the shelf and would hold the weight). A recommendation would be to have a different type of adjustable bolt, (one of those wheel types). The ease of moving the height up and down is very smooth. The bottom of the stand is scratchy, so if you have hardwood floors, get the pads. We ordered those, but they haven't arrived yet, so put a throw rung underneath. Overall, this is a good product and we expect many years of use with it."
5,Best on the market,"Purchased similar stands from Wenger @ $50, and they began sliding down after only 2.5 years of weekly use... they could no longer hold a binder and a hymnal. We replaced them with these quality stands from Manhasset @ $33 and they are STURDY and come with a 10-year guarantee. They arrived in a strong box, well packaged. Very pleased."
5,Music Teacher loves Manhasset,"Can I add a sixth star? I have been teaching now for 20 years. I bought my first Manhasset stand while still a student in 1989. I am still using this stand! It has survived 5 moves, innumerable outside performances and 20 years of music students. I even bought a second one for my daughter and was impressed to see it is still just as well made. Durable, above all other brands and highly recommended."
5,Fantastic quality.,"I had been looking for a music stand for a while and when I found this is in a local shop, I was very impressed. How delightful that Music123 had this item much cheaper online than where I was shopping. The lip is generous, the powder work on the metal is flawless and the stand itself is fantastic, even when my cat decided to try and make it a perch. Music123 shipped the stand very quickly and they are a delight to do business with."
4,Gift,"My niece loves her gift! As for someone starting out playing an instrument, she loves it! Glad we could get it for her."
1,Could not get it to work,I had to return the product because I could not get it to work. Great company. They gave me a full refund.
3,It's okay,"I bought this as a gift for my step-dad and although the concept was pretty cool, I think it works better theoretically. It doesn't quite have all the functions of the universal remote and doesn't always respond to voice command. We weren't crazy about it, so we sent it back."
3,Funny Little Diversion,"This is a brief addendum to the first three Zuckerman novels. It's a funny diversion about Zuckerman's mid 70s visit to Prague.I don't think it really added much to the overall story of the earlier books.It was funny and very Rothlike in tone.It's very, very short.I liked it.I recommend reading as an addendum to the earlier three novels. On it's own, it doesn't make that much sense."
1,Least helpful travel book I've ever used,"I bought this book before a trip to Costa Rica, based on the ""Lonely Planet"" name alone. Lonely Planet usually publishes the best travel books, but not in this case. We found that the directions to many of the establishments were incorrect, as were the descriptions. Some of the locals even pointed out parts of the book that were blatantly incorrect, such as certain restaurants or bars that were in a different part of town than stated in the book. This particular book could have used a better fact-checker. I will not be taking it with me on my next trip to Costa Rica."
2,"Outdated, sorely lacking, get Tico Times in-country","I bought this book for my Costa Rica trip (8 weeks w/ a class, 3 weeks w/o), and replaced it within the first week. Most of the hotels are priced above what is listed, if they even exist anymore. Same with the restaurants. Also, LP over-emphasized many extreme tourist hotspots without giving enough info about smaller towns (don't miss Cauhita!), lesser-known forests (check out the Children's Eternal Rainforest), getting around by bus, super-budget hotels or border crossings. My advice: wait until you get into Costa Rica, then get the Tico Times guidebook, updated EVERY YEAR, written by the local english newspaper. It's easy to find and so much more relevant, with maps of every town, bus schedules, local festivals (where and when), border information, updated hotel + restaurant info, and how to find the information you can't find anywhere else."
4,Very enjoyable,"Normally I don't read ghost stories. In fact, much prefernonfiction and this book is about as far from that as onecan get. Nonetheless, I found this book quite delightful.Maybe it is from the general void in lesbain fiction thatI found such appeal in Out of Time. It is well writtenwith humor and style, with a fascinating blend of pastand present, the real and unreal. Very enjoyable."
4,Herstory from the Shadows,"I've passed this book around to a number of my friends now- women who live with and love other women, and who've had the benefit of those shadowy figures who came before, but left tracks so hard to follow. This novel brings a necessary sense of the past most wonderfully to light; it's far more entertaining to my friends than the history lectures I've tried so often to give. I hope it serves to further whet the appetites of my circle for the quiet, hidden resonance of our heritage."
2,Safety concern in light of recent milk powder scare?,"My 8 months old loves this, but I just read the label this morning and discovered that it containes milk powder and it is made in China. With all the recent recalls of milk products in China due to melamine contamination, I've decided not to give to my baby any more until I have evidence that it is safe. Has anyone done any research on this topic?"
1,MADE IN CHINA,These are made in china...not a good idea at all considering all the food saftey issues of late. also i feel that it is wrong to buy food/agricultural products from another country (a politically hostile one at that) when our own poor farmers are having such a rough time making ends meet because all their work has been outsourced to these unsafe chinese farms. there are many much safer and ethically sound alternatives to these snacks.
1,Made in China!!!,"I loved these until I found out they were made in China. After they tainted baby formula, there is no way Im gong ot give these to my child."
2,Sadly made in China,"I bought the crackers for my baby son and he LOVED them. I liked very much that the ingredient list is so short. But then I discovered that the crackers are made in China - stopped giving them to my son and threw them all out. After all the lead in toys for children and melanin in baby milk, I just try to buy as little as possible that is made in China - and definitely nothing that my son will eat! If these crackers were made in the USA, I would totally recommend and buy them again."
1,Made in China & No nutritional value,"I went to BRU today to buy these after seeing how great a 6 month old was able to handle them. Every time I give my son a teether biscuit (Gerber or Earth's Best), he ends up chewing off a huge chunk and almost choking. The 6 month old who was eating these today had no choking problems because they melt. I was so excited to buy these. As I was walking to the register, I saw that they are made in China. Also, if you look at the ingredients, they have nothing of any value in them. Just empty calories...no protein, no vitamins, no fiber, no nothing."
2,Made in China- won't buy again,"I saw ""Japonica rice"" and made the mistake of thinking these were made in Japan. Realized they are actually made in China. I avoid buying anything made in China, if possible, because of the political ramifications, but particularly avoid buying products for my infant made in China because of the safety issues.My daughter did enjoy these, but I won't be buying them again."
5,Not Just For Babies,"I first discovered this product while stocking the baby food aisle of my local Wal-Mart where I work. I'm always on the look-out for low fat, low carb products and this fits the bill. There are 12 foil wrapped Mum-Mums containing 2 crispy wafers each measuring 4 1/2 by 1 1/2 inches.A serving is two of these easy to open packets,just zip them open from top to bottom along the side. They dissolve easily in your mouth and are still sturdy enough to spread peanut butter between for a sandwich that even a toddler would love, or top with tuna or egg salad without getting soggy. Great as a salsa dipper.They are bland taste wise but they're made of rice and they're a healthy alternative."
5,A big hit with our son!,"After my son had mastered rice cereal, we could not get him to eat any other food. Until we discovered Baby Mum-Mums! They become soft quickly and are an ideal first food.Now that my son is 2 years old he still loves these crackers. We have learned to bring a couple packages with us wherever we go. They are perfect at restaurants...we give a package to my son to tide him over and keep him occupied while we are waiting for food to come to the table. We bring an extra package just in case it takes a really long time for the food to come - best way to avoid a tantrum!"
1,Contains sugar and salt,"It is advertised as a baby product but contains both sugar and salt, none of which is recommended for babies.About salt in baby food: [...]About sugar in baby food: [...]Besides, it's written ""no mess"" on the box - not true in the hand of our baby (5 months).Never again!"
4,Great but kinda messy,My twins eat them as a snack. The are 8 months old no teeth. They live them. I found them at frys food grocery store.However they are messy!!! It cleans up easy. But boy it gets everywhere And sticky too
4,Sound very nice for price...,"I love loud music, bottom line____. Wasnt on a huge budget just didnt want to spend a lot of money on me when i have a newborn son, but i am happy with this purchase. They handle my request for loud guitar very well, of course you need a sub...thats why i have one and thats why anyone who wants bass should have one, people who said "" they dont hit lows very well""...well no crap they handle mids and highs nicely. You wont be dissapointed....JBL duh...."
5,Promise Delivered,These speakers are absolutely awesome for a small space like mine. Quality stuff. Just read the description and that's what you'll get. Highly recommended.
2,Save your money and upgrade to better speakers,These speakers are made for low wattage. Anything over two hundred wattsof power and they fade away. I own a Carver Sunfure Pre amplifier and a Carver amplifier that produce four thousand watts when combined. I will send the JBL Venue Series speakers back and upgrade to the Polk Audio ten series. They cost more but there is no comparison in quality and clarity between the two brands of speakers. These speakers are to light in weight to carry any substain with clarity. I recommend upgrading to the dual eight inch three way JBL speakers if you wish to have a longer life span with more clarity with your speakers.
1,not Lockridges' best,"After reading one of the Lockridges' Pam and Jerry North books, I ordered six more. As many reviewers have said, the prose is graceful and the ambiance civilized -- no gratuitous sex or violence (emphasis on gratuitous). Not so this book, Murder is Served: the conversation is stilted, the clues initially add up to one character as being framed and another character as the one who has set up the frame. About 7/8 through the book, however, a third character emerges as the villain, on far less evidence or stated motivation. Rehashing the clues and watching the cats serve as filler -- much too much filler. The quality of the plot is NOT what keeps people reading this series, but quality of plot, as well as prose style and conversation, takes a big downturn in Murder is Served."
3,Technodog,"I bought this as a gift and I've been told that the quality is very good. Don't opt for the expedited shipping however, as it isn't worth the extra money. All of my standard orders have arrived much sooner than this one did. The Company took four days to process the order and it looked like standard shipping was used."
3,No Mention of Garlic in description,"I ordered this cheese hoping for a good smoky flavor. It does taste smokey, but the garlic added was an unpleasant surprise for me. I think that garlic, being such a strong ingredient, should always be disclosed. I recieved credit from igourmet. ok"
4,"Great Playing, Solid Interpretation","The New York Philharmonic sounds great on this recording. The CD is recorded well. The balance is great between all the sections; with the exception of a few spots where the brass seem a little distant. I think the only thing that brings this CD down is Masur's somewhat sluggish tempos during the Symphony. The individual efforts a great all the players during the first movement, but there were more than a few spots that seemed slow and lacking a little bit of movement. The horn solo during the first movement was nailed. I think the second movement was successful. Overall I like Bruno Walter's interpretation of the symphony better. The Overture on the hand is 5 stars. All the tempos are up and once again the orchestra sounds great."
5,Heavy duty little pan,"Thick, 18/8 stainless steel, very well made, excellent for use on the stove. Measures 5"" in diameter and 2 1/2 "" high. The thick handle is 5 3/4"" long. Check out the 2 cup pan, also, if you're looking for a small saucepan."
3,didn't work,"I purchased Replenix based on my dermatologist's recommendation. While it didn't irritate my rosacea, it didn't help with the redness. Also, it gave me whiteheads on my forehead and I need to use 3 pumps (as opposed to 1 pump with Dermadoctor's Calm, Cool and Corrected)."
2,disappointing,"I had high expectations regarding Replenix since Dr. Bailey is so highly regarded. However, this product did absolutely nothing to reduce or alleviate my rosacea. I was mighty disappointed."
3,this book was necessary but bored me,"Even when I don't know a lot about the subject, I like books that say a lot to me through their format, their content, text layout, photographs quality. Nothing such with this ordinary treaty considered as an exam composition. Disappointing for such an explosive topics. Would ""new media"" be already out of fashion at the beginning of this century?"
3,Pretty good for '87,"This is a good CD from Blind Guardian but it's not great. There are some killer tracks such as, ""Run for the Night"" (arguably the best song on the CD), ""The Martyr"" and ""Battalions of Fear"", as well as ""By the Gates of Moria"" (an instrumental). The only thing is that it just took too long to get really good. This is a good effort for the band's debut and should be liked by fans of BG. Even back then these guys were killer (especially on guitars!)."
4,Battalions of Fear now sounds better,"Thanks to those that are responsable for remastering/ remixing this album, it really needed it. ""Battalions of Fear"" now has the sound that it deserves (Nothing wrong with the original; I have both original and the remastered). I can now listen to this album minus the muffled sound and having to turn the stereo to a high volume. This is definately worth picking up and replacing the original version with this one."
3,Low range,"This is a good addition to your kit but I feel the usage range is not impressive. You need this if you want to shoot in bulb mode. Don't expect this to work if you want to take family portrait, placing you in the middle. Also you would not know whether it set the camera on."
4,Nice enough,"Delivery from Amazon was easy and timely. Remote works well with the minor exception of having to be directly in line with sensor on camera. More design issue than anything. Wanted to be able to be behind or off to the side of the camera, but remote signal does not seem to get to the sensor. Does seems to be responsive when positioned correctly. No real lag time between pushing button and taking picture. Size is good for hiding it in your hand when taking your own picture."
4,works fine with Olympus 4/3 cameras,"I bought this remote unit for my Olympus e-500 camera. It works fine (only the shutter button). It is convenient for macro and long-exposure photos, combined with the mirror pre-elevation in order to avoid vibration.I didn't test it in my father's Olympus SP-510; I'll post my experience when I have the opportunity."
4,Remote control is usable,"The RM-1 is very compact and easily storable in the smallest of places. I use it with my E-300 Evolt Digital SLR. With this camera only the large shutter button on the remote is usable. The other 4 buttons for zoom and +/- are not applicable to that particular camera. A bit of a disappointment after getting it, but I probably wouldn't have used them anyway."
5,RM-1 remote,"had it almost five years, still works well as long as you are in front of the camera and within a certain distancevery useful to have in the camera bagseems well made (i forgot it in my pocket and i put it through the washer and the dyer, works like nothing happened)"
4,Olympus Remote,"Convenient product for self/family portraits and for zoom lens photos on a tripod when you don't want vibration from pressing the shutter release button. However, this remote needs to be positioned almost perfectly in front of the camera's remote sensor, which can be annoying."
5,didgital remote,This little device lets me be in the picture or shoot from a different angle. Glad I got it and the company delivery it on time.Thanks.
4,Great accessory,"this is a great accessory, I really like this for when wanting to take a self picture or for those awesome tripod shots."
1,Does not work for our indoor uses at work.,This is one line in the manual that the remote can be affected by fluorescent lights. For close up work with a tripod and fluorescents I can't get it to work.
2,Did not work for me,"I have an Olympus E-500 and I purchased this hoping that it would allow remote-control of the camera. I tried several different settings and none of them ""worked"". I downloaded a copy of Olympus Studio 2 and was able to make a nice series of 40 time-lapse photos without any problem. I hope the RM-1 works for you; otherwise, try Studio 2."
1,Dead on arrival,"RM-1 does not function. Insulated guard was removed and battery checks OK., but it doesn't light or blink. Will not actuate camera to snap picture. Disappointing for a brand camera. Suspect it will be an ordeal to correct the problem or obtain a replacement."
1,6020 stylus,I recently received a olympus stylus 6020 and ordered a RM-1 remote only to be told the camera does not support remote use.
2,Olympus RM-1 Remote Control -- Overated and too expensive,"I am using this remote with the Evolt E-500 DSLR.For the price? Not worth it... Poor range and delayed reaction time was annoying. Although, there is no other option for the model of camera I own. If you're looking for sustained exposure time, it'll do the trick. Anything more than that don't expect much."
1,RM-1 Impossible to Change Battery without Ruining It,"Aside from complaints about short range, in trying to put a new battery in, carefully, I somehow managed to damage one of the battery contacts, bending it downward in such a way as to make it impossible to reinsert a battery inside the small plastic transport. The tolerances are so tight inside that it could not accommodate the new battery inside the transport after the battery contact was bent downward. Because the slot for the plastic transport is less than 1/16 of an inch, there is enough room to insert a tool to bend the contact back upwards, but not enough room inside to actually bend the contact itself. One attempted battery change, and it was ruined. I'm looking for a non-OEM compatible now. Won't buy this junker again. First disappointment with Olympus after an e-500 and an upgrade to the e-510. Olympus shouldn't neglect these little products, but they did with this one."
3,"Works well, but you have to be close","From what I have found with this remote it works like it should, but I have found that you must be close and almost in front of the camera to use it."
5,A must-have for Olympus digital SLR users,"Having just entered the world of dSLRs, I was looking for a way to trigger the camera shutter while the camera was on a tripod. This does it so much better than the old cable releases - now I can trigger the camera while I'm in a group shot, or I can use the bulb setting for long shots while using an infrared filter or doing pinhole shots (using a modified camera body cap). There are two buttons for bulb--one opens the shutter (and keeps it open) and the other closes it. It is tiny, so it could be easily lost. However, I wouldn't hesitate as the price on Amazon was a deal."
5,Good product,Buen producto que reune las características que se ofrecían. Es suficiente para el uso para el que fué comprado. Buena relación precio-valor.
5,Perfectly balanced sweet and crunch,"These corn flakes are delicious -- not wimpy, thin corn flakes like you find in house brands. And they are just sweet enough. Nothing like Frosted Flakes (ugh).Everyone in our house loves them. Highly recommended."
5,great gluten cereal!,"I have followed a strict gluten free diet for about 7 years now and this cereal, I think, is one of the best out there. I eat this cereal for breakfast almost every morning and sometimes as a snack during the day. What I like most about this cereal is how universal it is. Besides a great breakfast cereal, I also use it to make special k bars (which my husband loves)."
5,Best Gluten Free Cereal,Nature's Path Organic Honey'd Corn Flakes Cereal is the best cereal I have found since I found out I am gluten intolorent.
3,2 very good songs,I ordered this album after hearing the songs on Miami Vice several years ago. The song In The Night was later redone by Ace Frehley of Kiss (the Russ Ballard Version is much better). The song Voices is just great. Play this one to your girlfriend when you can't figure our which personality you are talking to.
4,"More a ""Master Class"" than a piano lesson","I found this DVD to be more a master class with the excellent pianist Warren Bernhardt than a piano lesson itself. On some of the topics he covered, I only understood what he meant because I read a jazz theory book before and have been playing bass for over 20 years.I don't believe this DVD will teach someone how to play the piano. It will illustrate what is Warren Bernhardt's approach to the jazz piano and provide food for thought. To understand the mechanics behind what he is doing, we have to read books such as theThe Jazz Theory Bookby Mark Levine.But the DVD is well done, nonetheless. The camera is well positioned and he talks very clearly. He is a great musician and offers some very interesting insights. After I saw this DVD I got inspired. I called the technician to tune my piano and started taking piano lessons again."
4,Good pocket guide to aircraft,"As the title suggests, this book may be useful to take to an airport or an airshow and identify the aircraft present at those locations. The information presented is somewhat limited, but sufficient to provide a detailed explanation on each aircraft. Each of the aircraft in this book have one page dedicated it, and the page contains color photograph or two, specifications, history and some relevant facts, as well as a three-view drawing of the aircraft, which is useful in its identification. The drawbacks I found are that not all modern aircraft are in this book (the E-2 Hawkeye is missing, for example), but overall, it is very up-to-date."
2,Old stuff.,Most of entries old and complete reviewed in the past. Old but still-actual entries deleted from past editions. A lot of new and interesting entries omitted. I do not recommend this book! It's a waste of money!
4,THIS IS A GRATE BOOK 4 U,"THIS GIVES U INFO ON THE AIRCRAFT BUT IT DOES NOT TELL U THE SPEED,RANGE.OTHER WISE IT IS GRAET."
3,A compendium,"...but not much more. Its principal virtue, in my opinion is its apparent toroughness; not many aircraft still in operation seem to be missing. The quality of the book is very good for a paperback: good weight of paper, well glued spine; but still a book that will suffer if carried around in the field. My version of the book does have an index, contrarily to what someone posted earlier.IN MY OPINION, THIS IS NOT A RECOGNITION GUIDE, HOWEVER; you get one black and white photo, a few of poor quality (strongly croped, grainy or taken from an unpractical angle), silhouettes from below, front and side and a very brief technical comment. This will not allow positive discrimination between many closely resembling aircrafts.If you really want a good companion to go in the field and practice aircraft recognition I strongly recommand the very intelligently written albeit much less complete ""A Field Guide to Airplanes"" by M.R. Montgomery and Gerald Foster."
3,good but agree with the flaws,"I agree with the other review about the flaws. There were no speeds or rate of climb data, something I would like to see as an air traffic controller. More dates and, as I've seen in other books, aircraft that get confused alot would have been nice. But its Janes, were can you find better?"
5,AMAZING!,"I am a huge fan of Manchego cheese, so I ordered this sampler as an indulgence for my husband and myself. It was delicious, and well worth the price. If you're considering this, go ahead and purchase. You won't be disappointed."
5,Good cheese!,"If you like cheese, you will like the Spanish Cheese Assortment. It has 4 different kinds of cheese that were all tasty. Try it."
2,Mine leaks!,"Seems high quality because it's heavy. Handle is riveted to pan below the 2 cup mark, however, and it leaks when I boil water!"
2,Terrible delivery they lie,I paid for expedited delivery and then the day after placing the order I am told the item will take 10 days. This sucks and this is the 2nd thim this has happened with an Amazon client. The last time the item was returned by UPS for having a PO Box rather than a house address. Seems like these clients are getting worse and worse maybe it is time to go to reliable sites and forget Amazon. I wrote Amazon and still have not received a response.
2,Meh,"Interesting in that it showed the perspective of two different leaders. Too many historical details were wrong, so I almost didn't finish the book after a few chapters. Insight into native and Druid culture was nice, though I don't know if it was spot on. The final outcome was glossed over and blah."
3,Wrong Color,No where do I see where I can indicate a color preference on the product. I ordered 2 of the Monster strips. Both came in BLACK! I wanted white. Returning them today.
1,Not Worth The Buy,"I bought these strings last week and have already broken string, and other strings show signs of fraying only one week in."
2,didn't live up to expectations,"I expected my cat (7 months or so) to love this mat, from seeing all the reviews. She sleeps on it sometimes, but usually only when I put her on it. Not that great, wouldn't buy again!"
2,Nice but doesn't work,"I bought this at a much higher price at a pet store recently.It looks great but our cat doesn't seem to care much about it.Since it never seemed that warm when I felt it after the cat did lay there,I decided to try it out myself - both sides - and for some length of time.No noticeable warmth at all."
4,Cats seem to like it,"We bought this product because we have three cats and it was tough to sleep with all of them on our bed. It seems to have worked because at least one of the cats will spend most of the night on it each night. They haven't told me they like it, but I can tell."
5,Our cat likes this mat,"We (or rather, our cat) has had this mat for over two years. She tends to get cold readily and usually sleeps some or all of the night with us. But the rest of the night, and much of every day, she is on the mat. So we figure it must be warming her. She really seems to like it.The mat does make little crunching noises when she works it over with her paws before settling into it, but the crunching is not loud, couldn't wake anybody, and is actually sort of pleasant to hear, somehow slightly comical.It's less garish than it might appear in the photo, not bad at all. After two years, the mat is none the worse for wear.I can contrast this mat with the SnuggleSafe Heat Pad. While us humans have found that it does a good job of preheating our sheets for our feet in the winter, our cat never seemed to like it at all."
5,"Rabbits love it, too!","Very nice bed! I bought one for my bunny rabbit and one for my dad's cat for Christmas. My bunny loves to lie on it and will do so for hours. When he finally hops away, where he was lying is very warm. The bed is also quite plush, I was thinking it might just feel like two pieces of fabric sewn together. It's about 3/4 inch thick though. The fabrics on it are nice and soft and look good. While I've not washed it yet, I think it will wash very well. I didn't think the crinkly sound was very loud at all and it doesn't bother my rabbit, who we just rescued and is fairly nervous. My rabbit will be getting a ""girlfriend"" soon (don't worry, he's been neutered and she will be spayed) and this bed will be plenty big enough for them to lie on together. All in all, I think this was a great buy. It's good quality, was an awesome price and my bunny loves it!"
3,Somewhat works,"The pad arrived--one side is grey with leopard print and the other side is black. It's not quite as plush as in the photo and the inside makes a crinkling noise whenever it moves or my cat steps on it. My cat lay on the mat, so that's a plus. When she got up, where she was, indeed, was warm, but the rest of the mat never felt warm. So, it seems to retain some of the heat directly under the cat, but does not have the heated pad effect that I would have wished."
3,No warmer then anything else,"This bed is suppose to be thermal but it's no warmer then anything else I've ever gotten. I've even sat on it myself to see if it gets warm or hold heat and it doesn't. My cats sleep on it but it doesn't help keep my old cat warm, I still have to find some sort of heated bed for him because my lap can't be his 24/7 heater."
5,Great product,"Cats love them and they are machine washable. I bought 1 then 3 more for the carrier, car and house."
5,My cats gave this 5 stars,They all love to sleep on it. I just bought 2 more so all the cats would have one on the bitter Ohio nights.
3,Practice thermal blanket,"Practice thermal blanket ... serves to carry anywhere, perfect for kennel ... However expected to be a little softer the fabric ..."
4,Pet Mat,"It's a bit noisy especially for cats, but it does the job. All of my cats from 10 months to 12 years use their mats faithfully."
4,Great product!,"This is a handy, convenient item for any cat owner! It provides a soft, crinkly area for your cat to snuggle and nap on."
2,My cats won't go near these,"I'm sure these are wonderful mats for cats that will actually lie on them. However, my cats refused to go anywhere near these mats. I don't think they like the crinkly noise it makes when they walk on it."
2,5 stars? Really?,"Even though this thing is obviously hideous, I bought it thinking it was a good price and it would be great when the winter comes around (and my cat tends to be cold with the a/c on anyway). I liked that you don't have to plug it in, but I think it's crappy. My kitten has zero interest in it and she does like things that crinkle. I don't see that it provides any significant warmth, either. I don't know what people are raving about, but this thing pretty much sucks. I should have returned it."
3,a-okay,At first my cat was skeptical about this cat mat. After trying to make him use it I put it on 'his' spot on my bed and left him to use it on his own. Now he uses it all the time which is great for me because now I don't have a whole mess of fur on my bedding.
1,It's noisy and scares cat!,My cat won't go near it! The mat makes a crinkle sound likes a space blanket and really scares the cat. She runs from it. The dog isn't interested in it. Maybe it would work as a kind of heating pad for me. It uses reflected heat rather than electricity so it could be used with a back cushion.
2,disappointed,"Bought this bed approximately 1 month ago. My cat does not like/use this product. It simply does not get warm enough for her. She would rather sit on the computer or other warmed surface. I regret my purchase and have now purchased a plug in variety. This product's application should be limited to areas where electricity is not available for a plug in heated bed, as it is an inferior alternative.It appears to be a generally well made product. If I had to guess, it is a mylar/aluminum ""emergency blanket"" inside 2 pieces of ""fleece"". The mylar would account for the crinkle noise, which my cat doesn't mind. it only took her seconds to get used to it. It is quite large and I can't imagine that any housecat would not fit on it. At $15 the price is reasonable."
4,quality cat mat,"I bought this to put in a cat house outside, so that our neighborhood cat who roams around would have a warm place to sleep. He seems to enjoy it in the cat house I built."
2,Cat doesn't like them,"I read the reviews and then bought 2 of these for our cat. She doesn't like them. We have put them in all her favorite spots and repeatedly tried to get her to stay on one. Nope, she just moves somewhere else. I think it's the sound the pads make, crinkly. The size is good, no problems there. Well, you know how cats are....go figure."
2,Our 8 cats ignore this mat for the most part.,"We have 8 cats in our household....from a 4 month old kitten to a 15-year old cranky cat. None of the cats go out of their way to sit on this mat. I've tried placing it on the cat tree shelf, in one of the kitty condo cubes, on a bench that several lay on, near the wood stove, etc. The cats don't go out of their way to use the mat. The don't necessarily avoid it...since I have seen three of the cats sit, lay or sleep on it, but it happens infrequently and they don't seem to care about it one way or the other. I don't feel I've wasted money, because I had to try out the mat, but I probably wouldn't buy another."
5,These are better than electric pet beds!,"I bought a bunch of these for my cats and they love them! really great for putting in boxes with newborn kittens and my hairless cats love laying on these mats. great product! not made super well, but it works for the price."
2,Cats did not like them,I take care of cats who have been dumped in my neighborhood so thought getting three self-warming mats would make them happy campers. They hate them and pull them off of the large chairs I have on my front porch. I have three older self-warming blankets that I bought at Petsmart many years ago and some of my cats will sleep on them and stay warm. Good idea but the fabric might be bothering them even though I have washed them twice in case there was a smell to them.
3,didn't seem to generate much heat,I couldn't tell if the cat was warmer or not; when he left the bed I placed my hand on it and it didn't feel warm. Maybe it was helping a little but I doubt if it did much.
4,A warmer place to sit,"The mats cover a wooden bureau under my window. It is a warmer place to sit now. The cats like it. I bought 2 mats in grey. One mat is slightly green the other not. Well, the cats have not complained why should I ."
4,Good for your cool cat.,These warming mats work well. It took my cats a while to get used to them. The one cat uses it all the time and the other one really doesn't care at all. They each have their own.
3,Just another mat,"I bought this cat mat since my kitties like to be warm. I thought since it is cold the kitties would migrate to it. No it is just another mat for them. No one seems to love it. I like the color and size, it would be nice in a carrier too. The kitties could careless though. They rather just lay on the bed or in their kitty cubbies."
4,A bit noisy but seems to work,My kitty didn't want anything to do with this so I tucked it into a bed and put it in front of a heater and she finally decided to try it out. It makes crinkly noises but she doesn't seem to mind anymore and will even make muffins on it.
2,Might as well be an old towel,"They seem well made but my cats don't care for them. I got these so my cats would sleep on them and wouldn't get fur all over my bed. To my great frustration my cats happily sleep right next to them instead of on them. I have only occasionally seen a cat sleep on one of them. There certainly isn't any magic cat attractor about them. Might as well be old towels which work just as well, which is to say, hardly at all."
5,My cat outside cat loves this!!!!,"My outside cat loves this mat! She is a wild cat who sleeps in our cold garage at night and I have had other warming mats which she liked, but this mat is warming for her and is also plush. I put it in a small low sided cardboard box and it sort of cradles her, and she now stays in there much of the day also. I have never seen her so cozy and relaxed. I am so happy for her. It was so inexpensive I am going to order more."
2,cat's don't like it,"This is a nice, well-made mat, but for some reason my cats don't like it. I've tried it in several places where they lay, but they stay off it. I think maybe it's the crinkle. They just like cheap fleece blankets better than anything!"
3,Cats seems indifferent.,"Overall I was very satisfied with this sleep pad.My tom cat and younger female cat unfortunately are indifferent to it. Not for lack of quality though, they are just fussy.The product is well made and looks very comfortable. One thing to keep is the product makes a ""plasitc-e"" noise when moved or touched. I inevitably had to return the mat, it was shocking my cat causing him to be afraid of it.When I saw this item I figured the price was right, considering I wasn't sure if they would take to it."
1,Didn't work for my cat,I have a 12 year old cat and maybe that had something to do with it. She wont get near it. I heard such great reviews and thought it would be for wonderful for her but it didn't work out.
1,bogus blanket not good,"Sorry, this is not what it is said to do. Any blanket would have done the same thing. Not happy at all"
2,Thermal Cat Mat,"My cat does not like this mat, as it makes a crinkle sound when she walks across it. I did wash it to remove the odd smell, and hung it over a towel rack to dry. Will place it in a window where she can watch outside again in a few weeks."
1,"Small, Crinkly and Pretty Much Useless","I'm not sure how anyone gave this five stars but to each <cat> his own, I guess. My cat wouldn't go near his new igloo with this thing inside. It's flat and crinkly... not at all puffy and fluffy looking like the picture. I'm not even sure where it is now. I think my cat nudged it out of the igloo and the wind must have blown it away. Saved me the trouble of tossing it. I couldn't even think of another use for it. Pity."
1,My Cat Won't Use This Item,"My cat is one of those who just won't stay on this mat, no matter what we do. My husband and I have tried leaning on it, and we can't perceive any feeling of warmth, so maybe our cat doesn't either. I've been too busy to return it, but I should, if it's not too late. Guess I'll have to try a heating pad or electrified pet mat for her."
4,2 out of 3,"I have 3 cats, two enjoy it one doesn't. One cat really loves it and took to it right away, second cat took a few days to get used to it, the third one still doesnt use it, i think its the crinkeling noise he doesnt like. I wish it was available in larger sizes as well. Considering purchasing a second one."
4,Great Product!,"I bought 2 of these! My cat sleeps on them all of the time. Her fur is always warm as well, so I believe they doing their job!"
3,Scaredy Cats,"I checked out all of the reviews and decided to purchase not one but two of these mats for my two cats. They have been cold at night and I thought these would make them more comfortable. Well, so far (it's be 2 weeks) only one cat seems interested. They don't like the sound it makes when they walk on it. I will give it some more time, but haven't figured out how I can get them to lay on them. Here's an update-5 months later: Both of my cats like these pads. It took them more time than I thought necessary to adjust, but they do seem to like them and they both look warm and cozy."
4,My cat loves it so much we now have 2!,"My cat never likes anything I buy for her. Toys? She likes crinkled scrap paper and hair ties. Cat beds? She prefers the floor. Until this mat. I think the crinkle sound soothes her because I find her just walking all over it for long periods of time before she curls up. Even then, she keeps her paws out and ""kneads"" the surface."
2,Uninteresting to my kittens,I bought this thinking my 2 new kittens would love it. It may as well mot be in the room - they could not care about it less. On the other hand it is pretty and has a soft rustling sound.
4,"Cat doesn't LOVE it, but she definitely LIKES it","Most of the other reviews seem to be one extreme or the other, either their cat loved it or didn't care for it. My cat was just kinda meh about it. She wasn't very interested at first, and then as she got used to it she slept on it quite a bit for a few days. Now she treats it just like any other object she sleeps on. She doesn't seem to prefer it any more or less than the floor or the couch or the bed, but she uses it. Even though she hasn't gone completely bonkers for her new bed, I wouldn't say it's a purchase I regret. It is very nicely made, I received it quickly, and it looks and feels really good. Only thing is it's much thinner than I thought it would be. It's not an issue that it's thin (to me or my cat) but it's the only thing unexpected about it. Overall it's a good purchase, especially for such a good price."
3,Not sure if cats liked it.,"I put this in a little house I've got for my cats to use when they're outdoors but I think my cats were bothered by the crinkling sound it makes when they stepped on it. However, the opossum that sometimes comes up on the deck and eats their food looked very comfortable on it."
4,Cute! Cats Like It!,"My cats love thermal mats but I'm always worried about the electrical ones so I thought I'd try this self-heating mat. I'm glad I did because all 4 of my cats love it. I bought the gray colored one, it's very soft and it has a nice design.There is a crunchy noise when the cats step on it. They were a little unsure about it but they got used to it quickly.I think this product could have been made better by adding some more stuffing, it has only a little cushioning. However, I am pleased with my purchase overall and I will probably buy another. (1 mat is not enough for all 4 of my cats lol)"
3,Slumber Pet Thermal Cat Mat,"Cats don't really like laying on it. Not as big as I expected.Also, picture makes it look much more padded than it actually is."
2,Cat hates it,"After years of not having a pet, I adopted a Maine Coon cat this fall and after reading the favorable reviews for this product I purchased two of them. The idea was that I would put one in the chair where he liked to sleep and one on the floor near my computer. Unfortunately, he hated them and he ended up flattening out a large paper bag to sleep on. I bought some catnip spray that supposedly would help a cat get used to a new bed. That didn't work either. You can check out my picture on this product--he sleeps fine on the paper bag. Some people said the mat is too small for a Maine Coon but so is the paper bag. I don't hate the product at all, it just doesn't work for my cat."
3,Cat warmer mat,"My two cats will use this mat occasionally. I bought it because we turn down the heat at night. The funny thing is, they tend to use it during the day, but not at night. I'm not sure if they are getting much warmth out of it, probably at least some reflected body heat. It's a nice mat overall, and washes well."
5,My Cat loves it--and so do I!,"I wanted a simple thermal mat for my cat to lie on, as he will always snuggle next to my dog on any blanket or bed the dog lies on. The dog is getting old and cranky and does not always want to share. My cat loved this little mat and has been on it constantly since it arrived.The mat has a nice weight to it, and is thicker than other similar products I have purchased. It also does not have the annoying crinkle sound that the others do whenever the animal shifts his weight. The fabric is warm and nubby, really cute, and there is even a wide loop to hang the mat from if necessary.If you are looking for a simple thermal mat, as I was, this is a great product, at a great price, and I would not hesitate to purchase it. If you are looking for a super-duper pet bed with all the bells and whistles, see my other reviews, for I bought one of those for the prince of the house recently. I am happy to say that both purchases were winners!"
2,Mostly just a crinkly pet bed,"I cannot verify that this mat keeps my pets any warmer whatsoever. Like other reviewers, when I feel the bed either while my cats are on it or having just left it it feels like any other pet bed. Not scientific, I know. I would give it three stars if it were just that but when you add in the crinkling you lose a star! Not a terrible mat, but not a warmer mat. Just get your pets a regular bed with a less offensive print and no crinkle factor. (NOTE: this is a MAT = THIN; it is not a bed)"
5,Nice,"Nice thermal mat. I could tell it works from the warmth radiating from the mat. Funny thing is, my cat doesn't like it, but my English bulldog loves it."
5,very nice package,i've only listened to 5 of the 6 cds but i am pleased beyond my expectations. the musicality and production quality are higher than i could fault. the price is super. great value. enjoy much.
3,NOT THE BEST,"For the past weeks or so, I have been listening to this collection of Bach ORGAN WORKS played by Ton Koopman on various instruments. Some of the pieces are well-known (Toccata and Fugue in D minor), others not so well-known. The overall impression that I have is that of a hurried player, who wants to get it done and quickly. The recorded sound is poor, the phrasing is weak and the playing lacks in consistency and brilliance. I don't mean brilliance à la Virgil Fox. I mean steady methodic brilliance such as Bach demands. I am sorry, but this is not recommended.After rehearing the Toccata in D by this artist, I can safely say it's the worst version I have ever heard."
5,Glaser has another winner,"In a shift from his previous works, Glaser moves from solely gay/lesbian themes to a grand and inclusive view of creation. His crisp, clear poetry blends almost to perfection with the photography of some of National Geographic's most skilled artisans.The depth of Glaser's personal faith is clear even to the casual reader. Those who have read -- and had their lives changed -- by his previous works, will find themselves spending long periods reflecting on the gentleness and honesty of his words.This is a must have. It won't rest on your coffee table untouched. Rather, it will soon be as dogeared as a family Bible handed down for six or more generations.Highly recommended."
3,for the collection,"Not one of Szekeres' best, a little TOO simplistic, but our little grandson and great-grandson love them. Not as much fun to read aloud, though."
5,Strike Force Delta-the answer to terrorism!,"Like the rest of this series, this novel is full of action, and gives a clear answer to the problem of terrorism; hunt them down where they live, and execute them, and their entire families with extreme prejudice!If we are ever to have peace in this world again, we must root out, and destroy terrorism, and those who support it, and not let politics get in the way of what is a military problem.All known terrorists must be put on a bounty hit list, for millions of $$$$ and hunting them down, and killing them should be a highly profitable business!There was no crime a hundred years ago, because criminals were put on a bount list, and hunted down, and killed, for a financial reward. Hunting down terrorists should be treated the same way! If they're on the run, they can't plan, or execute their next attack on our country, or our interests!"
2,Nature Wonders Galapagos,"I am very upset about this. In good faith I thought the DVD would be 52 minutes long as stated on the cover. BUT it is only 9 minutes long. I believe you sent me a DUD. I have no way to get in touch with you, I emailed the Travel Video Store and got no response from them either. Unless this is corrected I WILL NOT purchase another DVD from you or the Travel Video Store. And why do I think I will NOT hear from you or the video store. Really angry."
3,disappointing,"Excellent price and from a respected publishing house but the book itself is, at times, unduly complex for beginners and generally has a flat, almost uininteresting style. You're arguably better off with something like Sams Teach Yourself HTML 4 in 10 minutes."
4,Useful Cheap guide...,"This is a great for learning the basics of HTML.Its also great for reference, if you forget a tag or something.I got my web page started using this book....HTML is rather easy, and this book makes it easier!And at 1 cent a copy what really do you have to lose?"
1,Don't waste your money and buy from SOTA instead.,If you want some high quality figures with over 20 points of articualtion then I suggest you spend your money on the Street Fighter figures that are being made from SOTA. Trust me you're going to get your money's worth.
1,Wow! So nice!,"I did not expect such nice plates and in such pretty little six-plate, round boxes. The colors are bright and the images are clear! The perfect hostess gift times two!"
2,I swear I'm not impressed....,"Being a fan of The West Wing, The American President, Sports Night and A Few Good Men, I assumed this book would have more ""Sorkin"" in it. Primarily it's a collection of folks over analyzing his work and contradicting each other at every turn. These are primarily people in love with the sound of their own reasoning. I give it a C-"
1,personal organizer,"Do not purchase this item. The first one did not work. I could not read the display. I offered to return it . The distributer elected to send me another. I received the second one, whch also did not work. I called the customer service listed on the insert and was told that they no longer manufactured them and could not offer me any help. I hope to receive a refund.I have concluded that the low cost is due to the fact that these devices do not work."
1,are you serious?,"Are you serious? Why would I want to use this little plastic gizmo when there is more stuff on my cell phone? I'm not sure but I'm thinking this is not a useful or functional item. I tried to use it but its weird, I don't know its just small and not easy to see or something like that. Well, anyway I thought it was pretty hot out today and I'm going to go get some water at the store, its just right down the street from my house. Even though I am tired of this house."
2,Spend your time in another way,"I think the basic idea of this book's not so bad, but the development of the story is not fluent: every chapter seems to have been idea without a precise idea of where the story was going to. Not memorable."
1,Poor at best,"Though not a member of the LDS Church, I am fascinated by Mormonism and have spent time studying it. It's definitely difficult for outsiders to understand the Mormon experience but this book sheds no light and does a disservice to it. This is an unfair and biased representation of the Mormon religion. In 48 pages, one can hardly delve into a religion and culture very deeply or accurately. On top of that, it's obvious the author has an agenda of his own and it doesn't have anything to do with presenting the truth. For a very interesting and fair look at the Mormon Church and culture, I highly recommend Mormon America by Richard N. Osting & Joan K. Ostling. Don't waste your money on this tripe."
1,deceived,I was looking for a book that told me about the actual facts and beliefs of the mormon religion and its followers. This book calls out certain elements and is based on author opinions of the religion. The description was decieving and led me to waste my money. I am not mormon but have family that are and just wanted to understand them more not know someone elses biased opinion about their faith.
1,No Better than the Original,"The Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), which can be reached at 1-800-FARMS-15, has published a pair of reviews of the longer Ankerberg/Weldon book on Mormonism. At length, with abundant detail and ample references, the FARMS reviews show Ankerberg and Weldon to be unreliable, sloppy, uninformed, sensationalistic, even bigoted. Of course, as evidenced below, there are some who like that kind of book. So, for those who like such books, this is very much the kind of book they will like. For those who actually want to understand the faith of their neighbors, however, Ankerberg and Weldon are among the worst guides I can think of."
2,Why not just ask a Mormon missionary what the facts are?,"I don't see much point on wasting time or money reading this book. To learn the ""facts"" about Mormons it would seem more wise to ask a Mormon than anyone else. It is clear to me that if you know what you believe is true, than learning the real facts about the Mormon religion wouldn't bother you, for truth is eternal."
3,Interesting but old in its concept,"Although the bok carries abut 6.000 marks, which is an amazing number for any knife collector, the concepto of the book is old, in my humble opinion. In 1998 it was almost impossible to print a good picture at reasonable prices. This may explain why most markings are drawn and not photographed. I hope the author/s would re fresh this book!"
4,Awesome but you'll need high end graphics card,"Utterly awesome. But you'll need a high end graphics nVidia graphics card. It will not work without one. Had to upgrade from my 440mx card to a 7300 gs nvidia. Slow to load and exit, but in between is pure delight. Even with cheat tips the first victory took over 24 hours of play. Highly recommend if you already have good graphics card."
1,DVD rom disc 2 install trouble,"I am giving this game one star in the hopes that I will eventually get to play it. I have a cutting edge PC, but DVD disc 2 of Medieval 2 will not install. Upon putting disc 2 into the dvd drive, I get a message that a certain file cannot be found. The only way out of this installation cul-de-sac is to cancel the installation. Great job, Sega!!! I should take the time to mention that no other games that I've purchased have had ANY installation problems. I've looked online, and have seen that others have had this same problem, yet nobody seems to have any idea how to get around it. Of course, on the games' official homepage, there is no mention of any installation problem. Anybody out there know how to solve this bug?"
5,One of the best strategy games of all time!,"I became addicted to TOTAL WAR ROME quickly, so I was really happy when MEDIEVIL 2 came out, and I wasn't disappointed. The graphics are great, the AI is smart, and the interface is easy. You will find yourself in massive battles in nothing flat. Works best on high-powered systems, so that you can turn up the graphics and really watch the blood fly. Easily one of my favorite games, and I've played a LOT of them."
1,Cannot get the game to work!,They should remove customer support from their website. I installed the game on two different computers that both run Rome: Total War and Barbarian invasion without a problem (and any game out there) and I cannot get it to work.I suspect the CD-Key they put in my package is the wrong one. I have tried everything I can think of and it still gives me an error prompt to install the correct CD to play the game. I have tried it with both CD's for the game.This is very frustrating to say the least. Sega has the WORST troubleshooting FAQ's and online support of any company I have dealt with. I have tried contacting them multiple times by phone and email without success.I enjoyed the series until this experience.
3,"Good, but not much different","The graphics are excellent, but there is not that much difference from the previous game. The assasin is pretty useless.Get it if you do not have Medieval total war, otherwise, I do not think it is too valuable."
1,Customer/Tech Support DOES NOT Exist,"I wish I could write a review of the game. However, I have not been able to get it to work. Whenever I try to start the game, it reverts back to the windows desktop. I have uninstalled/reinstalled it. I have updated everything that can be updated. I have sent NUMEROUS emails (you can't actually talk to a person). I did recieve one response; telling me i used the wrong email address (the one given as the tech support address). No response from the new address. It sounds like a good game, as long as there are no tech issues."
1,Great ideas ruined by terrible glitches,"This game could have been great. Even after the first patch though it remains too glitchy to enjoy. Go to the forums and see the list of glitches which still need to be fixed.Forget about playing multiplayer with a friend too. The server is pitiful. You will not be able to join half the games that are up, so if you have a friend or relative who lives far away, and you want to play against them, you may be out of luck."
1,Medieval 2: Total Freeze,"This program freezes after only a few seconds of gameplay in the campaign mode, requiring a cold boot of the computer to regain control of the OS.Here is my system specs:XP Pro SP2 with all upgrades from the Microsoft websiteAMD Phenom 9500 Quad CoreGeForce 8500 with 512 MB RAM3.3 GB system RAMRealtek Audio integrated 7.1 sound cardFor whatever reason it just doesnt work on this system. If you have a similar system, you might want to stay away from it."
1,Medieval II: Total War,I bought this for my son. I would review it but it would not work on any piece of equipment that we have meeting the specifications.
1,I'm at a loss,"When I got the game the registration code was missing so I was unable to install the game. Since I was unable to install the game, I was unable to enjoy it. So it was a waste of time and money."
4,great game,"this is a must have for any aspiring strategist, huge armies are at your command! One of the only things I didn't like about this game is, your pretty much a pawn to the will of the pope, if he is mad at you or another nation you must kiss butt to please him at all times, that is my only gripe with this game, that being said this is one of the most addictive total wars yet! It really is a must have."
4,Good Simulation,This game was pretty good. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 Stars was the fact that it is too similiar to the Rome: Total War Games. It basically is like a new version set in a diferent time period. It could have used a few more changes.
3,M2TW,"M2TW is an ok game. Although there are improvements from RTW, there really isn't that big of a difference. I still like RTW better.Pros-Graphics are pretty good.M2TW's AI is smarter than RTW's AI.Expanded MapMore playable nations.Cons-You need a graphics card to play M2TW I couldn't even play a battle with two units on the map. whereas I can run a 3500 men battle in RTW on my laptop which doesn't have a graphics card.M2TW's AI isn't that much smarter.M2TW is still pretty much the same as RTW but a different age.There still isn't 3D naval combat.It is still fun, but I would rather play RTW. That's why I'm thinking about selling M2TW. It wasn't the best game to buy."
4,great but slow,This game was a majer leap foward from what I'm used to. the grapics are great and so is game play. after I got this I got Rome Total War and rome runs faster on my computer so I play it more but overall get it if you have the space.
1,big disappointment!,"I am very disappointed with this game! I loved the first one and still play it. I just got this game and i played it for about an hour before becoming completely frustrated. I have a brand new pc with as much memory as you can get and this game runs slow as mud. It is really not like the first 1 at all. It seems like they took all the fun out of it just to improve the graphics a little. The gameplay is ridiculously complicated, and I am no novice gamer(I have played for over 20 years).I will probably never play this again, so I guess I wasted $40 bucks hoping it would be similar to Medieval Total War 1."
4,Medieval II Total War Review,"Nice game, but you cannot fight the battles because of video card issues."
2,Same as Rome total war,"This version is too similar to Rome Total War. Theres no reason to be a pagan who wants to destroy(Mongols, Vandals). You must want to build dirt roads, roads, then paved roads or lose.The new Pope election is fun, and maybe because its something new. The rest is just a repeat.It takes like 50 years to finish making a town."
5,Just One Man's Personal Story,"It is difficult for me to be impartial about this book as I am a descendant nephew of John Daniel. The book is alive as you can see the copies of the actual letters accompanied by the ""translation"". I was enthralled by this book - following John step-by-step through the campaigns and then to find out that he was killed in the battle of Atlanta. His final letter is reminiscent of a Hollywood war film - surprising for a man with his background. I was stunned and excited to find out that his grave is only an hour from my home. Great story about my Great-Great Uncle.This is a rare ""un-filtered"" story about the Civil War."
3,it's ok but it's not bad,it could be better and it could be silver for the same price. now that's a consept
5,Very professional multilanguage building dictionary,Very professional multilanguage building dictionary. Classical Russian dictionary with hihg quality. Recommend. AAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++
4,"Voodoo Moon, my review from Barcelona, high-calibre recording","It isn't classic Blues but is Modern-Blues or also Rock-Blues at its best by this 52 years old notable runner in the Texas Blues, 'Rocky Athas', in the same way as 'Stevie Ray Vaughan', even he often played with him, so you can notice it in the fantastic Blues ""Muddy Water Blues"". Others highlight numbers are ""Road Fever"" open track, marvelous, the sensational guitar work in ""Tearin' Me UP"", the shuffle ""Back On The Road"" and of course the acoustic numbers ""Sleep"" and ""Preacher"".... really all the record is very good, very great guitar and unquestionable rhythmical section work.I recommend it, my valuation is 4 stars."
2,This Quicken Product was a little late,"The software provided a sample of what I needed, yet, I found it was obsolete. I was expecting an updated version. I was not able to do what I really needed without ordering and paying for another version. Quite disappointing."
5,Good Lights,"These were easy to install and work well. Have two sets mounted low and high and all work well even at the ""as delivered"" settings."
5,awesome,"Disclaimer: I love psych. therefore, I have nothing but good things to say about this. I know it's not for everyone - my roommate doesn't think it's nearly as awesome as me- but I enjoy it."
2,One of the worst Psych episodes,"The acting from the regulars was good as usual, but the rest of the cast are plain bad. The dialog is awkward, the jokes lame. After seeing all 6 seasons of Psych, I found the lamest and most unfunny episodes are written by Andy Berman. His episodes often feature car chases, shootouts and stuff, but the story is often boring and the dialog cringe-inducing, making the characters sound un-cool."
5,Season 4 better than Season 3,"I purchased both Season 3 and 4 at the same time. The first half of Season 3 was a disappointment but they got their act together for the second half. The first episode of Season 4 wasn't much and I thought it might be deja vu all over again. But they definitely produced outstanding episodes for the rest of the season, perhaps the best and most creative for the four years available on DVD, so I felt good about spending the money."
5,Just like I wanted,"In true Psych form, this is just what I wanted. The episodes still crack me up, though I seem to be catching on to their mystery formulas. But I don't care since watching an episode remains a fun way to pass 45 minutes."
5,Psych rules!,Psych is one of the best shows ever on TV!! James Roday and Dule' Hill are perfect as childhood friends who now solve cases for the Santa Barbara police department. Each season is more creative and more fun! Shawn and Gus are my favorite TV duo ever!
4,Price is nice!,"I got this for like fourteen bucks. Excellent price! Psych is still awesome. The Yin-Yang conflict in each finale, however, is getting extremely tiresome."
5,Great season for a great show,"Chances are, if you're this far into Psych then you know what to expect and are already a fan of the show. Season 4 offers more of what you've come to love, the obscure movie references, the romantic intrigue between Shawn and Juliet, and, of course, the fantastic chemistry between all the characters. This perhaps the best of the seasons currently available and is capped by what might be the best episode of the series with the season finale. All in all, this is a great show and a very enjoyable season all wonderfully delivered by Amazon!"
5,Nakaraikov is Marvelous,Sergei Nakaraikov is a true artist on the trumpet. Regardless of the genre of music he makes it sound easy.His interpretation of the Gershwim is beautiful. Were I able to play as well.
1,Full of errors = buyer beware,I found 5 errors in the practice exam questions and the solutions.I wrote REA a letter that outlined these mistakes in great detail. REA did not respond to my letter. Five errors in the practice exam out of 132 questions seems like an awfully high error rate. I would not recommend this study guide.
1,out dated,"The basic skills isn't what it used to be. It now covers through your sophomore year of college. This book is outdated and the content is very inaccurate to what you will find on the actual test...75% of all the students who took the new test in October AND November of 2010 FAILED! Save your money, hire a tutor."
5,Kudos!!!Kudos!!!,I would certainly recommend this book to anyone that is overly obese 100lbs.or more overweight as I am. I could not think of money spent more wisely and it works.I have nothing but praise and gratitude to Dr. Nick Yphantides and his miraculous story.He has been there and knows the struggles of weight loss and the emotions carried with it.
2,Wonderful cheese but........,"Wonderful cheese but........Ordered the cheese and when I got it the expiration date was one month out and even immediately, it had a bad flavor. I love the cheese but won't order again from this site. I emailed them with the problem but they never answered. Guess the company doesn't care."
2,tiger cheese 24 oz 6 pk,"I was somewhat amazed that tiger made a 4 oz wheel instead of the traditional 6oz wheel that i am accustom to. The taste and texture are quite different, i will not order that again. I hope that i gormet does stock the 36 oz 6 pack, that i will order."
3,Watch out for different sizes !,"Many people have referred to the fact that this item is sold ""at the Dollar Store"". This is true, it is sometimes available at ""Dollar Tree"" but it is the 100g / 3.5 oz package. Still, that's the cheapest price."
2,cd cases,"these aren't bad cases. they don't randomly break like a lot of cases, but they're fairly inexpensive. good buy."
5,Nice Helmet with lots of optional equipment,"I've had my Metropolis for 2 weeks now. Its everything I hoped it would be.I love the rear light attachment strap. It make the helmet a little heavy but I feel safer with the light up high on my head instead of down on my seat.I also bought the rear view mirror. I have a handlebar mounted Cat Eye mirror which provides a generous field of view. In comparison, the helmet mirror is very small. This has taken some time to get used to but the more I use it the better gets. Regarding how it won't work with road handlebars, I have a road bike and the only adjustment I have to make is to move the mirror up higher toward the visor. That moves it out of my forward line of vision but keeps it in a usable position.I will be looking into the winter kit next..."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book is not good. Lake seems to have had little real hunting experience. His stories seldom match other hunter's experiences in Africa and his ""knowledge"" of firearms and ballistics is non existant. He invents calibres as often as he invents his experiences. But not only does Lake's own stories lack the ring of truth, his tales of others (such as Col.Patterson, whom he absolutes cans) are often figments of a twisted imagination. Lake's experiences of african animals are almost totally opposed to other African gun writers whom I admire and provide evidence to back their stories, as well as having their stories supported by other African legands."
1,You did not have Zero star,This is a racist book probably because his author is a Jew that hates Arabs.
1,Misinformed,"This book is a skewed, horrible misunderstanding of ""arab"" culture and thinking. Anthropology is such a pseudo-science."
1,Racist Garbage,"Substitute ""negro"" for ""arab"" and you have the idea behind this racist swill - the idea that a 'race' of people can have one way of thinking, acting, and behaving. I'd give it Zero stars if I could."
1,The Jewish Mind,You've got to be kidding: an East European Jewish writer opining about the Arab Mind and Americans. I feel the urge to write a tome about the Chinese mind as it applies to South Koreans.
1,Neo-Con Kama Sutra,"If you are looking for the origin of Neo-Conservative thinking (and behavior) in America, then look no further! Just as his present day disciples did with Iraq's WMD fiction, the late Mr. Patai was at pains collecting fictitious stories to forcefully prove his politically-motivated theory about Arabs: a doomed people obsessed by yack, sex & oppression. Wondering were torture techniques in Abu Ghraib & Gtmo came from?!"
5,Non-Arab Review of Arab Scholars,"Patai did a superb job in writing this book. His use of examples of personal experiences and the quotation of Arabic Scholarly sources guarantees a NON-RACIST study of the Arabs. This is a book best read at a slow steady pace, digesting what the author has to say. It offers food for thought and leaves one to wonder what he would say if he were still alive. Going back to the descriptions and examples used in the book, how can anyone call it racist when the facts are clearly demonstrated. For example, Patai presents the discussion on words as wishfull thinking. Can anyone forget ""Baghdad Bob"" saying there were no US troops in Iraq?"
2,Arab Mind? Can there be One?,"I lived in Jordan for two and a half years and read 'The Arab Mind' while submersed in the culture. I can't imagine a scholar of Arab culture would suggest such a bold title as 'The Arab Mind'. That is tantamount to suggesting there is a 'Western Mind'. Do Americans think like the French? Hardly. The book is good as long as you keep this in mind. There is no consistant view of the world eminating from Arabia. All one needs to do is look at the Arab League. A group of disfunctional Arab countries that barely can agree on where the sun sets at the end of the day. Again, there are good points in the book. But beware there is no panacea here. Don't take this book as gospel."
4,not perfect but fairly accurate,"This book certainly has its flaws but I was suprised of how much of it was true. Spending over two years in four different Arab countries I can verify that, in general, this book can help those operating in areas of Arab culture relate to and understand better the people they will come into contact with.There is room to criticize or disagree and some of his statements seem too sweeping and generalized but the charge of racism is off base. The author describes at length the limitations of such a study and admits some deficiencies. One might disagree with the methodology and those cultural relativists that deign to read the book will certainly not agree with any of Patai's conclusions.I have had extensive contact with people from Arab cultures from urban environments to remote wastelands and I can attest that there is much valuable information in Patai's writing. So think critically while you read and try not to let your world view inhibit the learning process."
4,COMPREHENSIVE STUDY,"Although the book was written well before 9/11, it explains why and how it came to happen. If the current administration had read this, most of the blunders of the Iraq war could have been avoided. This is a must read for anyone wanting to comprehend Arab thinking. It would be 5 star if it was shorter."
1,Racism Masquerades as Anthropology,"I was assigned to read this book about 20 years ago, in college, as an example of a book that should not be taken at face value due to the biases, errors and outright racism it contains. Based on my own years of experience living in Arab countries, I can confirm that the prejudices and errors are rampant. Might as well say that all Americans are named Chuck, wear baseball hats and ride skateboards while shooting their guns. I was appalled to learn that the US goverment is using it as a manual for how to deal with Arabs. No wonder they've messed up so badly!"
1,CAUTION FOR OUR MILITARY: research book before reading,"Get some outside scholarly opinions before considering this book. A simple Wikipedia search will suffice (be sure to read the entry's references). The book's popularity and revival mostly comes from neoconservatives and, in turn, the Pentagon's use of the book as a basis for understanding the Arab culture and, subsequently, creating interrogation/torture techniques to be used on Arabs. From other scholars' views, this book seems by no means to be a work of which to base notions upon the Arab culture. ""The book is described as simplistic, reductionist, stereotyping, generic, essentialist, outdated, superseded, flawed, unscientific and even intellectually dishonest by other scholars."" It saddens me that this book is given to our men and women in the armed forces. We can do better, and so can you: do the research."
5,Beautifully done version of classic Pooh stories and poems.,I love all things Pooh and this is the most beautiful and complete version of the classic Pooh tales and poems I've seen. I highly recommend it to anyone who shares my love of Pooh.
5,Wonderful book,"I bought this book as a baby shower gift, and couldn't have been more pleased. It has an attractive cover, sturdy pages, and a good binding -- all necessary for years of bedtime stories! Like most classic Pooh books, the only illustrations are the original drawings, so the emphasis is on the story. One note: This is a big, fairly heavy book. It's something to be read to or by an older child, maybe at bedtime, but it's not as durable for the poundings board books get."
5,It's never too late to love the authentic Pooh...,"Every wonderful story, poem and illustration are here to be cherished in this beautiful volume. Buy it for your children, your grandchildren - and yourself. Don't be an Eeyore - enjoy!"
3,Wonderful Book - Terrible Binding,"We bought this book about a month ago for my Pooh loving 3 year old, and it is amazing. All of us thoroughly enjoy reading it and it is by far her favorite book. We love the stories and the added bonus of the poems. Milne really was brilliant. As far as content, I would give it 10 stars if I could. However, within a month the binding is falling apart so rapidly that we will most likely have to throw it away soon. Huge chunks of pages are coming out and more appears to be on the way. I am very disappointed in the quality."
5,Beautiful book,We purchased this book for our 9 month old daughter. We love it! Pooh & friends are no doubt every childs favorite. A must for any childs book collection!
3,just so so,My boys would usually only eat about 1/2 at a time which tells me they don't care for them. I think it's the weird aftertaste that I found it to have.
1,too much sugar!,"Yes, these bars are reasonably good and your kids will probably eat them. But they are not ""healthy"". Brown rice is good for you, but these bars are coated in sugar. When its called ""cane juice"" its still sugar, and organic foods can also be junk foods. Cane juice is the second ingredient, which means there is way too much of it in there to be ""good"" for your kids. Don't let ourself be fooled into thinking this is a healthy choice - its organic junk food."
1,RETURNED ITEM,"I never Authorized this purchase, so I refused shipment and returned (as AMAZON told me to do)"
4,Good Snack,"My kids love this bar. AND it is gluten/wheat free, so I really love it. Good to take in the car, snack box, lunch box, treat after lunch, etc. & it is organic. They like the chocolate but did not like the peanut butter at all."
5,A staple in Lunch Box Central,"When my kids started kindergarten they needed to pack a lunch everyday. My wife realized that this was a teaching opportunity about nutrition, making the right choices, and responsibility.Each day the kids pack their own lunches from Lunch Box Central. Each lunch must contain a protein (usually yogurt), a grain (some form of cracker or grain filled bar), and a fruit (apple, banana, or fruit cup).EnviroKidz Organic Crispy Rice Bars are a grain staple in Lunch Box Central. They are less than 25% fat (25 fat calories out of 110), and low in sodium (90 mg). I wish they were higher in protein (1 gram), fiber (1 gram), and lower in total carbs (20 grams). They are convenient and the kids enjoy them. They're a reasonably healthy choice.The kids are happy, they're learning, and they're eating well. My wife is pretty smart!"
5,Great taste!!,I really like the EnviroKidz Organic Crispy Bar. My kids who are not gluten-free eaters enjoy them as well. Who can complain about a healthy organic chewy chocolate bar at only 110 calories each???
5,Great tasting snack,"I ordered these after reading the positive reviews here and wanted to return to add yet another positive one. These are tasty, have enough chocolate taste to satisfy and are a very light crunchy snack. The price is great too as well as the convenience of being able to ""stock up""."
2,Defnitely for kids,This too-sweet bar is gooey and not in a good way. It's way to sweet for an adult's sensibilities although I'm sure kids would love it. I ate two and gave the rest of the case away. Not to my liking.
2,koala crispy bars,my kids like all of the flavors but chocolate. They say they just don't taste very good.
4,Solid GF and organic product,"Not delicious but its pretty good and fulfilling. It's a good choice for road trips. Its nice for those of us that eat organic and gluten free which makes it hard to find something to eat on the road, these fill the need. Peanut Butter is my fav or the Envirokidz crispy rice bars but the chocolate and berry are good too."
4,One of my favorites!,"I own more than 600 Barbara Cartland titles, and I have to say, this one is one of the better Bantam ones. Cartland does a lot ot themes with the abused heroine. This one has a particularly evil step-mother who uses caning and starvation to try and kill off the only person who knows her true nefarious deeds. And then there's the hero, who wed this sister in spite, not knowing he got the true prize until she heals. If you're looking for a regency that will keep you reading, don't pass this one up."
1,Didn't received the item,"I purchased ""Call of the Heart"", but I never received this item...so, I rated the seller with only one star, cause I could't give it less rating... :("
1,So Very BORING and UNORIGINAL,"Don't suffer through even one page of GET THE PICTURE. If you are a beginning film student look for a different author because this one will waste your money. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, IT'S TERRIBLE!!!"
1,I didn't like this book,Basically this book had nothing to me as a reader and student on film. I was disapointed by the examples this book used and the entire book was pretty dumb. I must admit the cover was far better than the book.
1,Too Dry....There must be better books about film,"I was excited the day my order for this book arrived, I was wrong. This book sucked. I saw a bad review posted for this book and I should have listened, now I have to buy another film book because this book was no help on the subject of film"
3,Guitar DVD,More a demo of each star playing instead of an actual how to play DVD. Fine if you just want to see them noodle for a bit. For an actual lesson check out Kiss Forever or one of George Lynchs actual instruction DVDs.
5,S Club Juniors are awesome!,"This cd is great to listen to. They have such singing talent. I recommend you all to buy this album. All the tunes are catchy, and you'll find yourself singing to them in no time. Also, buy the S Club 8 album - 'Sundown'."
1,I'm Left Speechless....,"I can tell you this...I'm left speechless, and that's not a good thing. I never really heard about the auditions for the S Club Juniors but I did find out about them until they came out with the first single, One Step Closer. Now, I'm am an S Club fan, probably one of the biggest ones in Wisconsin so don't critisize me just because I'm an S Club fan and I dispise the S Club Juniors. I really tried to like them, I'm serious, but it just didn't work. I mean honestly people, they're just a bunch of two year olds attempting to sing. I'm not kidding you, the music video for One Step Closer traumatized (or scarred me if you will) for life. So to end this reveiw, I only have to say one thing: STAY AWAY, FAR AWAY, FROM THIS ALBUM! thank you."
1,Disco's painful revenge.,"After buying this album and selling it, I finally am going to write a review for it. This CD brings together the reject remakes of awful disco tracks and more modern european kiddy pop. The kids that recorded this album should of waited a little longer because some of the songs are so rediculous for kids to sing. Like, Feel That Beat... this song needed to stay in the disco era where it belongs, the vocals were below-average, and it seems that their ad-libs were un-nessicary. The only tracks that are worth buying are the first 3 the rest are just rubbish.Recommended Tracks(or singles):One Step Closer - Great dance song.New Direction - Has a fun, urban, pop feel to it.We Got You - Its a remnance of kids singing fun and upbeat songs."
1,HELLO,"Hello!! Do u realize wat u r listening to???this ""bubble gum pop"" makes me sick!!!why not buy a worth wile cd like the young and hopeless by good charlotte???"
1,Waste of time and money,"This proved to be a waste of time and money. The pump is too stiff and to let the air out you have to use your other hand. Or, I am not doing it right, which means the instruction manual does not provide proper guidance."
1,too powerful,The pump function was interesting and might be good if the vibrating function wasn't so strong. It was like getting a massage with a jack hammer.
1,dissapointed,"This product was a waste of my money.I'd say it sucks...but it can't.The vibration is wasted on the attachments.If I had a sexual problem&used this,I'd still have a problem&a bigger insecurity."
4,ok Product,The vibrating part of it is amazing. but the suction part dosent always work. above all it dose its job.
2,Disappointed,My husband and I were very disappointed as there was hardly any suction - that sucks!! :)I don't like spending more money for a more expensive one when this had a high rating attached. The ratings SHOULD matter!
1,BEWARE: DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE MONEY!,"I should have read the reviews on this product before I ordered it. However with the Berman's name on it, I thought that maybe it would actually work. There is very little suction- I couldn't even feel it, and as for the vibrator part, it was weak also. I tried to cancel this order but they had already sent it. And of course, since I am STUPID, I just had to open it up and try it out. I do not think that it is right that you can't get a refund. I understand that they could not resell the object because of hygiene problems, there is still the fact that I am a non-satisfied customer. If you want to order toys, look up Adam and Eve. They DO guarantee their products and always give money back on personal items that you don't like."
2,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"The fact is it did'nt work well from day one and only got worse. Vibrator function made more noise than an electric shaver and the pump feature did'nt work without the vibrator being activated. Believed that ""Berman Center"" products, since endorsed on OPRAH,would be reliable. Wrong again."
1,ultimate piece of junk,"This is the worst piece of JUNK, the batteries don't fit in the handle properly and the lid keeps popping open, shutting the unit off. It also kills my hand, wrist and fingers to have to keep pressing down on the button to get it to run while I'm scrubbing, which completely defeats the purpose I bought it for, in the first place. Right now, I am in so much pain, I can hardly type this review, and I only used it for about two or three minutes. No way could I get a whole bathroom or project done with it. It didn't do that great of a job cleaning, either, a sponge or scrub brush works better. I hope I can get my money back, don't waste yours. NOT WORTH IT."
2,Poorly Engineered Product,"When I saw the TV ad for this product, I thought that it would be perfect for cleaning the grout between floor tiles. It wasn't. First of all, the brush head was badly engineered. It was on a ratchet swivel, but the head angle would not stay locked when pressed into the grout. Moreover, the brush head supplied with the product did not have strong enough bristles to clean grout, though this was one of the uses mentioned in the television ad. A toothbrush with firm bristles would work better!"
4,Scrubber,"This product is exactly as advertised. Very good for what you need it for. I only wish it would have a few more RPM's, but all in all it is a great product."
4,Great scrubber.,"Great for scrubbing those hard to get out stains in my hubbies work clothes! Still on the first batteries, too."
1,It is a piece of junk!,"You cannot even load batteries into it. You remove the end to put batteries in, but the end is not strong enough to stay in place when the batteries are in. So all you end up with is a brush with no power. Would love to have my money back. I recommend the Sonic Scrubber if you want one that will work off of batteries."
4,Alternate tunings,THis is probably one of the most approachable title you'll find if you're trying to learn about alternate tunings.
2,Smaller bottle then ordered,the bottle I got was smaller then the bottle that i ordered. As you can see the bottle is already pretty small. So you can understand how upset I am to get something smaller
4,PLEASE don't leave a message!,"This is a great CD but all the radio interludes are annoying. Some advice for Rupee don't let the talk promote the music, let your talent do that!The hitz are:(2) Till' Morning(3) Tempted 2 Touch,(5) Frenmy and my favorite(9) This is Festival(13) No More"
5,Rupee's excellent music once again.,"Following in the footsteps of Rupee's debut solo album, Blame It On The Music, Leave A Message makes you wish the answering machine never runs out of tape because the music is just so good. Whilst many of the songs sample older hits, he masterfully recreates them with lyrics and rhythms that reflect the frenzied atmosphere surrounding Caribbean soca music. A subtle reggae beat can also be heard on some of the slower tracks like Girlfriend and She's a Winner. I listen to this CD in the car, at home, and especially love it when it blasts from some powerful speakers in a carnival party...you'll get Festival Fever and want to Jump Up Till Morning. And did I mention that the lyrics are great and you'll want to sing them?"
2,Installation headache,"Be forewarned - this product is vulnerable to the vagaries of microsoft update patches. I spent over a day pulling my hair out trying to get this to work. The install kept crashing my computer and the uninstall really screwed things up. I finally saw that the manual says that product updates often lag windows update patches so I uninstalled Windows Installer 3.1 (the most recent Windows Update download), reloaded the expanion software and it worked. One other piece of advice - when starting the install process, there is an option to download a more recent version of the software from the Internet. Don't do it - just load the software from the cd and then update it once it's installed. The product seems to work well, but I am wary about how it will react when new Windows updates are installed. Because there is no customer support on weekends, i have no idea if they are helpful. Their web support and product manual do leave a lot to be desired."
5,Simply the best!,I love this product so much and am so glad that i found it! My child loves it with mixed frozen blueberries. According to my taste buds this is the best flavor of all the rest in the series! And it arrived the next day after I ordered!
5,Four ingredients and a delicious taste,"Nature's Own Organic Flax Plus oatmeal has four ingredients -- rolled oats, evaporated cane sugar, flax seeds, and sea salt. That's it. No ""natural and artificial flavors"". No food coloring. Nothing except those four ingredients. Even better, it tastes great. Each packet contains ~20% of the daily recommended fiber (for a 2000 calorie diet, as is always the case for nutrition labels), and, again, it tastes better than Quaker instant oatmeal. Granted, it's more expensive than the ""popular"" brands, but it's worth it, in my opinion."
2,ADVICE FOR A COLLEGE KID ABOUT TO GET ON THE INSIDE TRACK,"This is another one of the books that gives a heads up to a college kid about to enter the corporate world. It works you through a bunch of exercises to see which career you would like, as if you had a choice between careers in the modern job market and every career leads to an executive track. This sets the prospective college kids' expectations too high, misses on the relevant advice of getting internships before graduating, and is useless to anyone who knows what they want to do, anyone out of college a few years, and anybody fresh out of college looking for a career grade salaried position for anything over six months, they are liable to hrow this book down in disguist!"
2,Arrived Broken - poor packaging,"Unfortunately, this teapot is not packaged well by the manufacturer. It arrived with a broken handle. I should have taken heed from several other reviews that noted the same. It's too bad, because otherwise, it's a nice little teapot in a beautiful cobalt blue. I will be looking for a replacement locally."
2,Teapot pours really badly,"This teapot is a generous size, but it dribbles terribly. I replaced it with the For Life Curve teapot, and I love that.FORLIFE Curve 45-Ounce Teapot with Infuser, Mandarin"
3,You Can't Always Get What You Want,"The teapot appears to be a quality item and should last. I'm actually glad that it's made in China, because in my experience Chinese porcelain is more durable. BUT, Amazon sent me a red teapot, not the blue one that I ordered. You'd think Amazon would have the foresight to look in the box to ensure that what is printed on the outside is in fact what is on the inside. I know that I could've returned the item and then re-ordered, but that's a hassle. And not a way to run a business."
4,"High quality tea pot, but too large!","I've been on the hunt for nice quality tea pot for several weeks. While this product meets my high quality standards, I found it to be too large. The description does not give you an idea of how large it actually is. So beware...it's very large! Aside from that, there were no flaws, the paint/glaze is excellent and the color (Blue) is a very pretty."
5,Soldier's Heart will open your heart,This is a heart-rending movie which paints a realistic picture of a Vietnam Veteran who is still living out the pain of war. He begins to unravel the roots of his suffering as he takes care of his dying father. The viewer gets a compassionate window into his struggle and how he begins to resolve it with the help of his family and loved ones. The filmmaker truly understands the true nature of PTSD as a soul wound and an identity disorder. A must-see for anyone concerned about the damaging effects of all war and violence.
5,"I Am Coming Home Also, But I'm Not A Soldier","I have to tell you I was completely moved, although I very much identified in a different way. With my own struggles, today I have the same kind of experiences as Elliot. You don't have to fight in a war to experience post traumatic stress disorder. The fiery outbursts are common in my life. It was scary, really scary, to realize that I was truly looking at myself as I watched him. And just as with Elliot, through self-acceptance, I believe that I, too, will have the opportunity to come home. So you can imagine, at the end, I was completely broken up. Which was good. And necessary. Because it allowed me to identify where I'm coming from, and to see where I will be, as I continue to allow myself to heal, by accepting help from family and friends, just as Elliot did. Beautiful."
5,Soldiers Heart,"Soldiers Heart is a wonderful, moving story of a Vietnam Veteran who is living, painfully at times, with the invisible war injury of post-traumatic stress disorder. The war is over, but the hurtful long-term effects live on in our returning soldiers. There are tender, sweet moments in the film, as well as disturbing battle flash backs. The relationships this Vet has with family and friends are complex. While watching Soldiers Heart you cannot help but think about Veterans you know and wonder how much pain they are suffering through as a result of PTSD. This film makes me proud to be an American. Veterans are to be held in the highest esteem. This film stays with you for quite a long time. It is superbly written. I have recommended this film to friends and family, and they all gave it 5 stars. I sure you will, too."
2,alright for advanced guitarist,"My best advice is if you can benefit from this DVD you don't need it. If that makes any since. Bob Brozman is a brilliant guitarist, not a teacher. The DVD is very short on instruction and long on watching him play full speed with very little explanation or break down of what he is doing. If your a beginner or intermediate guitar player you need to go with something a little more basic."
5,Secrets revealed.,"If you already know your cords and at least a couple of progressions you will tremendously benefit from this DVD. If you have problems syncopating, you are bored with playing the same rhythm over and over again, if you want to enrich your rhythmic vocabulary or simply become a better player I highly recommend you to get this video. Bob Brosman generously shares the secrets that in my opinion make the difference between been an aficionado and becoming a proficient guitar player. He starts from the basics, in fact he starts the class without using the guitar but his bare hands and his feet and moves gradually to show you complex rhythms and polyrhythms that are make you want to dance. This is without a doubt one of the best instructional DVDs I own. And trust me, I own a lot."
3,Mizani Kerafuse Review,"The product was delivered in a timely manner. I was skeptical of the authenticity of this product because the cover was sealed with clear tape (outerlayer) and when i opened the product, like most brand new products the inner layer is always sealed but with this product it was not sealed (innerlayer). The color is yellowish, the texture is lightly thick and it does not have a strong smell. It is easy to apply to the hair and it easily rinses off. My advice is once the product is rinsed off, follow it with a deep conditioner or a hair mask or else your hair will be hard (afro textured hair). I've used it twice and i haven't noticed a big difference in my hair. There is still breakage. I will keep using it until there is nothing left, from there i will make a full review."
4,Good...but read this first!,I had breakage and really needed some protein. I am relaxed with 4b/4c hair. I tried Aphogee a couple of times and loved it but it's so darn messy! Mizani Kerafuse is a cream so I tried it. It works but it is VERY strong! Next time I will mix it with a deep conditioner and probably use another conditioner after that just to be sure I am fully moisturized. Use some Silicon Mix afterwards and your hair will be bouncing and smooth! So Mizani Kerafuse is great but it's very very strong.
5,Most wonderful adventure story I've read lately!,"This is one great book that touches one deeply. Emotions, drama, adventure, extreme sailing, danger, travel all over the world, and on the top of it all, Russia and Russian life from the unusual prospective. It is hard to put this book aside, it is a great story. I recommend it highly!"
5,Tremendous Effort,"""Glorious Failure"" is an extreemly thought-provoking novel. It is, essentially, a critique on our current social system with tie-ins to how our current experience relates to the understanding of mankind's ""unanswerable"" or ""eternal"" questions. The thing that makes ""Glorious Failure"" unique is that it is written from the perspective of an extremely young man. This is a viewpoint that is often overlooked or tackled only by writers of advanced age looking for a little nostalgia. In a sense, the voice of the novel is reflective of that youthful fear and excitement. There is the hope that things could be changed for the better but the fear that we, as a society, lack the power to do it. Most importantly, the work rings true and I think anybody who gives this novel a read will find something in it that is worthwhile."
1,Buy somthing else,This is actually a non official release.It is not sanctioned by the band.You will not find it on their official discographies.Save your money and buy something from their official collection.
5,one great song,"Now im not a huge fan of this band, but i am just slightly impartial to the song ""kayleigh"" cause welll i was named after it. when my mom was pregnant she heard this song and thought the name was beautiful and that the lyrics were really how she felt about her relationship at that time. since i have such an unusual name i lvoe to tell people i am named after such a great song that most people have never even heard of. i am proud to be named after ""kayleigh"" its a wonderful song, and when you listen to the lyrics you will truly feel the impact of it."
2,European DVD,Product is only playable on European DVD players. Make sure you have one or it will not play. I do not have one. Got my money back.
5,Digital For The People,"Ok, what you have here is a disc with 16 R.E.M. music vidoes, plus several bonus ones (added from a recent version of ""In View""), plus three songs performed live. There are some very short pieces of commentariy from individual band members, and that's it. The packaging is alright, though cheap. If you love R.E.M. and wanna get some of their vodeos, than this is for you. $30.00 is a bit pricy, but ""In View"" is one of my favorite DVDs."
1,REM DVD,"I was very dissappointed when I rceived this DVD. When I made the purchase, I was under the impression that it was a REM concert, when actually it was just a DVD of a CD which I already have."
4,obviously for REM fans only,"In a vast, and eclectic collection of REM's greatest hits, the videos emote what REM has stood for all these years. The music. Though fully formed thoughts that went into videos like ""bad Day"" and ""imitation of Life"" balance well against the morning and lathargic feel of ""E-bow the Letter"", ""Nightswimming"" and ""At my Most Beautiful"". Balancing this video emotional roller coaster is revitalizing songs like ""All the Way to Reno"" and ""What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"". In all this collection has something for every music lover....more so for the REM fan"
3,Not the Andy Dick Christmas movie.,"Amazon really needs to add a description for this. This is a Story Store tale described as follows: ""When George sends Pip to Granny Clump with a special delivery from The Story Store, he mixes up the packets with disastrous results. Poor Pip is so upset by the havoc he has caused, that he sets off alone into the wide world and George has to search in the howling storm for his gloomy little chum.""The package contains a 32 page book and two bonus episodes -- Double Trouble and You Must Remember This. Running time is 30 minutes and is rated Ages 5 and up.Gave it three stars as I'm sure it's a good thing for kids, but didn't know what rating to actually give it. Since I THOUGHT I was buying the Andy Dick Christmas movie, I was more than a little disappointed. I'm sure my nephew will love it, though.This review is provided so that you don't buy the wrong movie by accident. Happy holidays!"
4,Beautiful watch,"I like this watch, it was for a gift for my girl and she loved it. It was a good deal in Amazon."
2,Too old to be of use,"Thi book was too old to be of use. It refers to an importent CD which is no longer available, therefore, it's missing an essential element."
5,How your mind can keep you well,"This book holds the key to nothing less than life itself. Roy Masters has found a beautifully simple technique to solve lifes answers ; a special meditation. This words in this book will come alive as your understand how to live your life from the inside out. You will learn how to conquer lifes problems without effort. As you become objective with the meditation, you will experience a content joy with the world around you. You will see the self imposed prisons you created for yourself,let them melt away, and your life will never be the same. Then you will learn how to let your creator lead you to peace. Very highly recommended!"
2,Beware the inaccuracies,"Just browsing through this book I came across two errors in two minutes. It states on Page 22 that Carole Lombard was married to Cary Grant (rather than Clark Gable) and that ""The Philadelphia Story"" won 1940's Best Picture (rather than ""Rebecca"".)Those are pretty big errors that should have been picked up by an editor."
2,Typo in the index,It claims that Doctor in the House is referred to on page 29. Actually DITH (which I don't care for) is written about only on page 28.
1,give me a break,"If you need to buy this book to confirm your own faith, you are in trouble. If you don't agrre with another's beliefs fine. Agree to disagree. Everyone has the free will to belive as they might, but that doesn't mean Mormon-bashing is acceptable. Really, grow up. If you feel the need to share your beliefs, share your own, not the beliefs of someone who condemns others for money."
1,This is a book not to buy!,"The author really has no clue what he is talking about! I Challange him to read the Book of Morman, pray about it, and attend the morman church. Then lets see what you have to write."
3,"Powerful book, feverish response...","The Book of Mormon is a 380+ page book that seems to have a powerful effect on people. Many embrace its words as divinely translated verse to guide them to reconciliation with God. Others are disturbed by its content and vehemently attack it as a fraudulent work of Joseph Smith's fiction. I'm amazed the Book of Mormon has such a power to inspire millions and enrage at least as many others. It seems the Book of Mormon can be everything, EXCEPT ignored. This critique of the Mormon's scriptures failed to be a conclusive agent in this area. My mind is still open, and I'm excited by the possibility that this Book is a modern Bible from another group of scattered Israelites."
2,Oh Please!,"The cover was the best part. I found this book difficult to use. In was my first programming class, I wasn't able to use the book as a reference or a learning object. I would pass on this book and use online documentation."
3,Good laptop...... hardware reliability issue?,"I bought this laptop 2 months ago and found that it has had no problem processing whatever I throw at it. However, the DVD drive has now stopped working unless I physicaly hold it firmly shut, not good. I wonder if this is a common fault????"
5,Makes a great cuppa java!,"More than 5 years ago I started traveling for work, and purchased my first 20 oz. PD french press at a local coffee shop. I've used it almost every day since, and love it. I purchased the 48oz. press for company. It does keep your coffee/tea warm for a couple hours. I've used several glass types, and besides being fragile it's not possible to keep coffee or tea hot for very long.I've seen the negative reviews, I'll just say the prong on the press can get caught on the lip of the thermos, just take care when placing on the container to press the coffee. I do baby my french presses, wash them out by hand. No problems."
4,planetary french press,This is a great product. It filters the coffee very well after it has brewed so no grounds get in your coffee.
4,"best press to date, but . . .",pro:volumethermal carafefilteringcon:flimsy plungerslow to pouri have tried most of them and this is the best so far
4,"Awesome product, but the lid absorbs taste/odor","Easy to use, makes great coffee - I'll never go back to drip. I've got a French Press mug, too, but the lids both absorb the coffee taste and smell. Planetary design says that you can have great coffee in the morning, and then a great cup of loose leaf tea in the afternoon. Won't work unless you have two different lids! The plastic absorbs the coffee. And it gets stale after a while, so the coffee starts to taste bad after a while, too.To fix this problem, soak the lid in white vinegar for about 30 minutes, rinse with hot water, and you're good to go. But if you're going to use it with loose leaf tea also, get another press lid assembly."
2,Planetary french presses,"At the beginning I really liked it. It keeps the coffee warm enough for about 4-5 hours. However after two months of usage, it starts to get rusted inside. And this is supposed to be made of stainless steel!"
3,bottom aluminum band split,"*I like especially that it doesn't break*It keeps coffee hotter than the glass ones*If the inside rim is kept wiped free of coffee grounds it does not dribble*It is attractiveThe only fault is it is not dishwasher safe. But I would not want to give up the rubber seals and the pad on the bottom.10/1/2010 On follow up:I just noticed that the aluminum band on the bottom has split. It is still usable so far, but I don't know the future effects. I am not sure what caused it, but my usage has not been ruff."
4,Just one big flaw,"Great French press, no more broken ""unbreakable"" glass! This thing holds heat for hours and looks nice too, been using it over a year now. My only criticism is the plunger. It is plastic for one thing, though the screen and rod are still metal. It is really hard to describe in short, the bit that seals to the wall of the carafe is the plastic piece and it is angled and cut about every quarter inch. Inside of that is a metal expander ring to press the plastic bits against the wall. So the problem is three fold. First, plastic and hot liquid can be bad for your health. Second, dregs get through the cuts in the plastic. And lastly, if you are not very careful when putting the lid on, you can bend, and/or break those plastic bits.I would give it five stars easily if they did a redesign on that part, I would pay a little more too! If anyone knows they did that, please leave a comment so I can change my review."
2,I really really wanted to love this press,"There are some many things I love about the design of this press on paper that just don't work out so well for me.The stainless steel interior is nice, but I have large hands, and the top edge of the rim is surprisingly sharp. Since you have to hand wash, I always have to be extra careful.The next thing is the plunger. I realize the fit has to be tight, but here again I would point to the rim of the cup. It is not tapered enough for my wife to get the plunger in the cup very easily without breaking the edges of the plunger or spilling the hot contents. She already tore up one of the teeth on the plunger. Fortunately the wire spring in the plunger and the teeth themselves are decently built.I find I have to put the plunger in sideways and then fiddle with it while it sits to get the lid on.I think this is a nice start, but if I need another one, especially considering the price, I would probably go back to a glass press."
2,I hate this pot,"Except for the steel kettle, the rest of this pot is plastic with a little bit of mesh. The press itself is molded plastic and mesh and does not work well, it does not come apart like a traditional press for cleaning. Furthermore, the spout is part of the lid - also plastic - and retains the smell of the coffee. You can NOT MAKE THE POT SMELL CLEAN. I recommend other pots. I wish I could send this one back. I hate it."
2,purchased for a camping trip; leaks when pouring,"We love our glass french press and use daily - sometimes twice! Needed something shatterproof to take camping so bought this. Worked fine first few times, then started leaking from rim when pouring which is quite messy. Also, like other reviewers, wish unit completely closed, have to put piece of aluminum foil over pour spout opening. Coffee still warmish hot after two hours. Wanted to exchange product, but hadn't saved original packaging."
2,Disappointed - Insulation does not work,"I purchased this french press because I was tired of my glass one failing to keep my coffee warm. I drink lots of coffee (especially on weekends) and I had been transferring coffee from my french press to my insulated thermos in order to keep it warm for a few hours. So, I started shopping around for an insulated french press. I was super excited when I opened this one up - it's lovely, it has a great pour spout, it's super large, it looked easier to clean than my other press, etc. etc. HOWEVER, it absolutely did not keep my coffee any warmer than my glass press. Could be a flaw in the design (the spout is always open allowing air to come in). It's a lovely french press, but if you're buying it because you want something to keep your coffee warm, you may have to keep looking :/"
3,I liked my smaller version of this product.,"For some reason, this coffee press gets clogged and the tea comes out in a trickle. I used to own the smaller coffee press and this never happened. Other that that, I love how easy to clean this is, it's indestructible and keeps my tea warm."
3,Works great with no grounds in the coffee-but plastic on the plunger,I have only used it twice and got great coffee with no grounds in my coffee. Coffee does stay hot for about an hour and warm for at least another 2. I have not used it long enough to determine if it rusts or not. I was discouraged and would have given it 5 stars at this point if there had been no plastic on the plunger. The plunger has a steel strainer which works great but it is covered or enclosed with black plastic. I worry about that with cancer and all. If they would make it with all stainless I would give it 5.
5,"SLIGHTLY SPICED, ALWAYS DESIRABLE SCENT","This is one of the early women's fragrances launched by Boucheron. It is more dramatic than Initial, highlighted by a floral Oriental tone.Jaipur or ""jewel"" was inspired by a trip made by the company's current president's grandfather to Jaipur, a city whose reputation for precious stones was legendary. Thus, the fragrance was introduced in a jewel flacon. The original bottles are, of course, highly prized by collectors today.Long recognized as makers of elegant, luxurious jewelry Boucheron began in 1830 when the first store opened in Paris. It was not until 1988 that the first Boucheron fragrance was launched."
1,Don't Buy From Easy To Grow!,"The Easy To Grow Bulbs company does not provide customer satisfaction.I always buy my wife an amaryllis bulb for Christmas, and have been doing so for almost 25 years. One year I ordered an Mmaryllis bulb from ETGB. Weeks later I was still seeing no signs of life. I emailed the company and asked for a replacement. I got a letter back hinting that I was watering it improperly, or that I had not planted it in a timely manner, or that I was just being impatient. One month later the bulb was either dormant or dead, and further requests for a replacement were met with the equivalent of, ""Buzz off, loser.""My wife is an experienced gardener and has never had a failed winter-forced bulb before. Therefore, I recommend that you avoid ordering bulbs from ETGB--becsue they wont' make good if your bulbs are bad."
3,Check file - slim organizer,I bought this to organize my monthly receipts and bills. As I do most of my banking and bill payment online I don't actually use this for organizing checks. If I had to use it for checks only I think it would be great. Otherwise it's a bit too slim for me and I wish it expanded a bit more.
5,12 Pocket check files,These are very useful for a number of thing as well as a check file.(They are rather expensive relatively speaking however)
4,Great Way to get Organized,Want a great way to be organized???This is it! File all of your monthy stuff here! Used these for years..& love them!
2,Too much sugar,"Way too much sugar and not enough fiber. Will not buy it again. Also what qualifies as ""natural flavor""????"
1,Sugars beats the purpose of buying oatmeal for health,"The company does a good job at packaging, so the box looks all ""healthy and organic"". Fooled me even though I did inspect the box before buying. Unfortunately, they are adding an absurd amount of sugar to the product, which defeats the purpose of buying oatmeal for health reasons. Serving size is 50 g, out of which...18 g is sugar! Way to go!Oatmeal shouldn't have any added sugar, period, especially if you are going to use ""healthy"" marketing to sell it."
1,not gluten free,"even the website says they are wheat free only, not gluten free. oatmeal can contain gluten if it's grown where wheat was grown previously, it picks it up from the soil. I wouldn't trust these until the company says they're certified gluten free."
5,Hot Oatmeal,I truly enjoy all four flavors in the Nature's Path Organic Instant Hot Oatmeal. I get it at Amazon and I have it on automatic re-order once a month. I was thinking of having a bowl soon since it is almost time for breakfast.
3,Almost....,"I like all the flavors except the flax. The reason I give it three stars because the cereals were all gummy, no matter what cooking method I used. Other grains are added to the oats, which I do not care for."
3,so so,"honestly, I'm used to sweeter, less healthy instant oatmeals or Quaker slow cooking oats but since I'm trying to eat better I ordered these. I absolutely have to add splenda in order to get it down although I do enjoy that the oats are larger and chewier than Quaker. But other than the oats, the liquid it is suspended in is very strange, almost gummy. The apple does not taste like apple. They are very stingy with their rasins and nuts. I will make myself eat it because of the nutritional content and hope that the taste will grow on me."
5,Very Happy,"Got this very quick. Ordered in May 2012 There were no details as far on expiration date when I ordered , when I received exp date is until April 2013. I'm very happy."
1,Overpriced & Lacks Durability,I was very disappointed in the LapCool 4after about 3 months. At first I appreciated that it kept my lap cool for hours but only on it's high setting. The low setting was a waste for it provided absolutely no relief from the heat produced by my little Thinkpad T41. After about a month I grew tired of how slick the surface was and required an extra tray to keep steady on my lap otherwise my laptop would slide off from side to side. After a couple months the fan kept losing power because the plug-in to the LapCool4 was flimsy. The plug into the LapCool had bad wiring or something for I had to jiggle it to get the power to come back on. AFter 3 months the plug stopped working altogether and jiggling no longer worked. The LapCool4 is way overpriced considering how flimsy it is.
2,"Not for Dell, Not for Me","I only wish that I could give a good review of this product. Unfortunately, I can't.First, while I can see that it might be useful for other computers, it is not well-fitted for use with a Dell notebook. Problems for me include:-- The top is too slippery for the notebook to stay on it.-- It doesn't cool the computer well -- As I type this, my computer (which has only been on for a few moments) is growing hotter by the minute -- something that the product is supposed to prevent.-- No matter how I try to position it, the cooler itself slides on my lapdesk (a wooden/leather one).I'm going to be sending it back as soon as I get done writing."
4,solid performer,"the package comes with tons of extra brush heads and gizmos, but the most important thing is that the toothbrush works well and leaves your teeth feeling clean. High pitch operating noise give the impression the brush is giving your teeth/gums a good workout. My only quibble would be that the battery charge doesn't live up to the advertised 12 days (if I recall correctly), although that also depends on individual use."
5,Bit Pricey-But well worth it!,"I've used all types of film thoughout my photography days and by far Kodaks treated me the best. If your out to capture rich, vibrant colors this is the film for you. So far I've shot 4 rolls of it and I'm amazed at how much the colors stand out. Its definatly the film I'll be using."
4,just not big enough,"I thought this would work well for my husband but when I got it, it was just to small for him."
3,Good for the price,"My only complaints are that the cover opens really hard and wakes up the 4 year old in the morning, and the insulation isn't that great. I would also like to see it a couple of inches wider, so that I could put my coffee thermos inside.The price is right."
4,Nice size and easy to clean,"I got this cooler because my work lunch bags got smelly and gross and weren't easy to clean no matter how well I tried to keep them nice because they held moisture. This is near perfect by comparison. It holds a small lunch and with the addition of ice packs, keeps it cold all day in my office. I'm not sure it would be as effective outdoors or in a hot place, but it keeps my lunch and snacks cool all day if I put in a few ice packs.If it latched closed more securely, I'd give it five stars- as it is, it can open up if tossed around the car or upended.Mostly though, it is great because you can really clean it out to keep it odor free. Take the dishes out of it as soon as you get home and leave it open overnight and it stays free of old lunch stench quite well."
5,A Classic Bio,I bought this for a creative writing class in order to check the writing style and chronological order of the bio. It was very well worth reading and the story was told in an interesting style.
5,A Wonderful Magazine,"Kansas sometimes gets a bad rap. People think it's flat and boring. But I'm here to say it's not true (and I'm NOT a Kansan). Kansas is a beautiful place with rolling hills and wide open spaces and big, big skies and wildlife abounding! This wonderful magazine gives tribute to all the beauty of Kansas. I encourage anyone who loves wildlife, is a birder or just wants to know more about the state in the middle of our nation to subscribe to this magazine. It is an exceptional gift to someone you might know who lives in Kansas, too. It is lovely."
3,Could be improved,I like these tags but I would like them better if I could get them engraved to personalize. Little pricey. Service is good.
5,Best Drug Book For RN students!,"This was the first drug book I bought in RN school. My friends bought Mosby's, Saunders, & Springhouse. They are always borrowing my Mosby's because theirs either does not have the drug they need, or it does not have all the SE listed for CV, etc, or it does not have the herbal interactions listed. Mosby's has all those. It is a complete drug book. I won't buy another brand in the future. Sticking with Mosby's. The only complaint I have is that after 2+ years, the binding cracked on mine, and huge chuncks of pages are falling out of the binding. The book gets kind of abused in my book bag. So, that is why I am buying a new 2006 version today."
1,The CD-ROM & website reference suck...,"I just purchased this book, and I was really excited when I received it. However, after 5 attempts of trying to install the CD-ROM, I gave up, and... the worest thing is, I tried to visit the website the book provided, in order to get to contact with them & ask for help... I was not allowed to view the page... cuz they blocked a lot of IP address, and the cable company that I have is on their list.........If you want to get a USEFUL CD-ROM for drug reference, don't get this book... it will cause you a lot of headache & troubles. Get Nursing200X drug handbook published by Springhouse. The software is good, and I never had any problem with it."
5,Drug Guide,This book was pre-ordered prior to printing. It is everything I expected and more.Thanks!
5,Great Nursing Resource,"Once again, Mosby has provided a thorough guide for nurses (and related health care workers!)for drugs making this one of the best resources currently available."
5,Very useful product. Great value.,"I order several boxes of these every few months. It's certainly true what other customers have said about them being thin. But I'd disagree with the ""flimsy"". Flimsy to me means shoddy construction, and these work just fine and will not tear or separate easily. If you're looking for something thick and sturdy, then this isn't the product for you, but if you just need something to hold a stack of papers separate, then these are a brilliant solution. I looked in several major office supply retail stores and couldn't find a clear poly folder solution that came anywhere near to this product in value. I think the negative reviews are unfair in that they are rooted in the fact that the customers were looking for something else entirely and basing their review off that. As a transparent file jacket (albeit a thin one), it fit the bill and does the job. I even bought the thicker version of this same product and rejected it as I preferred the thin jacket."
3,Flimsy Page Protectors- Not Folders,"These ""File Jackets"" are very thin and flimsy.They are not strong or sturdy like other plastic folders. If you put papers in them and toss in your bag, the ""jacket"" and your papers are likely to get bent."
4,File Jackets *Are GREAT,Great protector to *separate* Important papers be able to see what with out opening & keep clean and tidy.
3,Not what I expected,I was expecting theis to be a bit heavyer than what I recieved. being that they are quite flimsy and open on two sides documents easaly fall out of them when moved around.
2,Mildly interesting war fiction,"The premise of this book is that it is an expose of atrocities during war, focused on the behavior of the Japanese during WWII, Pol Pot's Cambodia, and Stalin's Russia. As another reviewer has said, the author appears to be hiding a gross racism. The horrors perpetrated by the subjects are all well-known and at least somewhat documented. However, it appears that the author has used those actions as a springboard for his own fevered imaginings. Wild descriptions of sexual slavery, cannibalism, disembowlings, and beheadings are strewn throughout this little book. That's not a bad thing in itself; I personally enjoy both horror fiction and extreme cinema. But this book masquerades as history, and with no footnotes, no bibliography, and no documented sources, its claims are highly questionable at best.I'd recommend this book as fiction; but if you're looking for history (and I was), keep looking."
4,Annihilation Zones,"Too horrible to read straight through. Had to put it down and rehumanize myself. The leaders who were characterized here were depraved, inhuman and held ultimate power. It did not matter what nationality the leaders were; once a leader, they became monsters. I also have a new UNappreciation of General MacArthur as a conquering hero."
2,"Good idea, massively exaggerated.","As a uni student actively studying this sort of material, I was interested to read Barber's book. However, it quickly degenerates into a mess of explicit sexual activity, mostly between the males in the book, and includes wild claims - without any references or source given - such as Hitler being raped by Stalin etc. The depiction of the Magadan camp in the Soviet Union is particularly exaggerated, given that when the camp has been discussed in other works, such as Applebaum's ""Gulag"", the sick acts forced upon the inmates were not mentioned at all - yet Barber treats these acts (I can't discuss them here as they are too explicit) as if they were all the prisoners engaged in. All in all, the book can be read as informative but under no circumstances should it be taken as a factual account of what happened."
4,NBA Live 2005,"I am writing about the 2 best game I ever played. I gave NBA Live 2005 4 stars. In the game you can play different things like the 3 Point Shootout, Rookie Challenge, the All-Star Game,but my favorite thing to do is the Slam dunk Contest. In the Slam Dunk Contest you can throw the ball off the megatron do a front flip and dunk it between your legs. These are the reasons why it is a great game."
2,A dissappointment...,"Here is my opinion:1.) Player models do not look realistic..arms too long, heads too big, and backs are hunch over a little too much...maybe it's just me.2.) Defenders are too quick...players move faster than their legs do.3.) Slam dunk contest too difficult for the average gamer.4.) Graphics seem outdated compared to the other basketball games available...I won't mention any names.5.) The only thing I like is the voice commentary with Marv.Sorry if this review sounds harsh....but earlier nba live games are much better...2003 and 2004."
2,Still Arcade-like,"This is still an arcade-like game. Pro Basketball is NOT a game of constant running up and down the floor. Most scoring opportunities are NOT dunks. And, most jump shots are NOT blocked.ESPN 2K5 offers a much closer simulation to real Pro Basketball. Yes, the graphics/animations could be better. But, the overall game is much closer to what an NBA game should be."
4,This game under rates people.,This game is alot of fun it is far better than NBA 2k5. That is probaly why it cost more money. The only thing I don't like is first I think this game under rates most people like Kobe Bryant he holds the most 3pts in game 12 but they rate a 78 on 3pts i mean he i rated a 99 no id say about 85 or so.
1,Worst game i've ever played,"This is the crappiest game ever! It's not realistic at all, it makes me so mad!!!! If Live 06 isn't the best game in the world, I'm suing ea sports!!! NBA LIVE 05 IS POOP!"
5,the best game ever,"This game is the SHIZNAI! NBA live 2005 is the best game i've ever played in my life! The Freestyle Air really took this game above any other basketball game ever. Compared to this game, ESPN 2K5 looks like 1986 Pacman arcade games in pizza parlors. NBA Live 2005 is a bargain at $50 because of realistic graphics and everything else."
5,The Best game ever!,"NBA Live is the best game I have ever brought home. I originaly was going to buy the Harry Potter Collection, until I saw this. Buy this game this instant. It is the bomb!"
3,"Why EA, why!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I like this game but, what happen to the magazines in the D-Mode, and what happen to when U buy extra traning for $300 U dont see the coach, coaching how to do shooting, like in 2004 Live"
5,Cta Digital Mini Battery Charger for Minolta NP-400,Nice & compact ... and affordable.Did the job when traveling and had forgotten original Pentax charger.
2,tiresome read,"I have read roth's books before and usually enjoy them. this book was a chore to read. nathan zuckerman's brother dies in bypass surgery and then we find the same brother in Israel so that the bypass scenario was perhaps a book zuckerman was writing. various characters live different scenarios throughout the book and it doesn't seem important which is the real one. Unfortunately, besides being incredibly confusing it is deadly dull. Roth spends most of the book indulging in tedious , repetitive monologue---i can best describe most of it as blah, blah, blah. so the scenarios really don't matter because there is no story--just a framework for pointless verbiage."
2,Dull. Vulgar. Tries to be clever. Fails.,"One of the problems with metafiction is that once you realise you're reading a novel featuring the clever gimmickry of characters meeting their authors and so on, it all becomes very predictable and you can soon see the next ""surprise"" coming. This book not only lacks imagination, it has no class at all: Roth is bawdy without being stylish and the whole thing just descends into vulgarity and self-impressed cleverness. The anti-Zionist aspects of it are interesting but not enough to neutralise the book's other problems. Which is a pity."
4,Heartwarming story :),"I am a fan of Kristin Hannah's books and this storyline looked really interesting. I really did enjoy the book, but found it to be slow at times. Once it picked up, I found myself wanting to know more and more about the mysterious girl and what happened to her. It's not my favorite, but if you're a fan you will like this book. Hannah has written some really good books...The Things We Do For Love is my favorite along with On Mystic Lake."
5,OUTSTANDING,"What a great writer. Can't stop reading once I start her books. Just finished ""What We Do for Love"" another 5 stars"
4,Great Page Turner,"This is the first book I read by Ms. Hannah. Almost all the characters were very well written and the storyline was outstanding. I saw this book at my local library and couldn't resist getting it. I love the summary of the story. I never read one with this type of story glad to read something fresh and interesting. Only problems I had with it was the treatment with Alice wasn't realistic it seem like she needed more time to adjust to surroundings. Maybe if Ms. Hannah would of put dates in this book maybe it been realistic to see how much time went by with Alice. Also, Julia's sister character was alittle too whiny for my taste and didn't seem that strong being a police chief or sheriff that she was. I would of like of seen a more strong and confident character in her. The love interest for both sisters was very right on and a joy to read about."
5,Exactly what the title says--MAGIC!!!!,"I am a long time fan of Kristin Hannah's. I've read everything she's written and unlike some multi-published authors, Hannah just gets better and better with each book she writes. And MAGIC HOUR is no exception. The title says it all---this book is pure MAGIC!! I don't like to read reviews that give away the plot and so I'm not going to comment on that except to say that this story blew me away. It was everything I'd come to expect (and love) from a Hannah novel--true emotion, deep characters--but it was also a story line so unique and fresh, I could not put the book down. If you've never read Kristin Hannah give yourself a huge treat with Magic Hour. And, if you're a Hannah fan like me, I'm sure you've already pre-ordered the book!! Another winner from an extremely talented writer."
5,Love this book and anything written by this author!!,Love this book. The author really has an insight to the heart of people and understands what it takes to write a fantastic book. Great storyteller. Look forward to more books from her.
5,Magic Hour,I love Kristin Hannah's books and Magic Hour was no different. It is a wonderful story. Kristin Hannah has such a gift at telling stories that find their way into your heart.
3,"A little amateurish, yet compelling","If you can overlook some clunkers of plot, this story of a psychiatrist bent on redeeming her reputation and her life by helping bring a ""wild child"" to civilization will capture you. Not only is there the mystery of who Alice is and how she came to be virtually raised by wolves, there's also the story of what makes a family and how we create community.Not the most believable tale in the world, but a heck of a lot better-written than many titles on the best-seller list (Mary Higgins Clark, anyone??)."
4,Chockfull of magic hours,"You may come to think the title refers to the hours you spend reading this engaging book, for the time will pass incredibly quickly as each page draws you to another. There were many times I intended to stop at the end of a chapter, but refused to put it down as I needed to know the next element. A few too many events were predictable, but the story was certainly well-thought out and I truly cared about every character. I'm hoping for a sequel!"
2,Forced myself to finish this book,"There were times I couldnt put this book down, then times I wanted to put it down and never pick it up again. I found the adult want-to-find-love romance parts of the book boring, typical and predictable. I loved it when the auther engaged me as a reader about Alice and Julias work with her, I suppose I was expecting and wanting something more raw and realistic. I was annoyed with the flip-flopping on the book that was one chapter Julias love life or lack there of, Ellies love life or lack there of and then Alice and her progress becoming a socialized child. It seemed liked I was forcing myself to finish the book simply because I bought it. The ending was good, but good in a very predictable way that you can predict the end of a good romance film. If this book were split up into 3 different novels: one ""Julia loves Max"", another ""Ellie doesnt know it yet, but she loves Cal"" and ""All About Alice""...They all would have been great!"
5,Love,Love love love!! Another must read by Kristin Hannah to add to your list. There isn't a book I don't love of hers
2,"It started strong, then fell flat","I was enjoying the story, the elegant descriptions, and the characters for well over half of the story. Then as the plot progressed, I ended up feeling like a schmuck for wasting time reading it. Wrapping up every loose end in a predictable way turns out to be unsatisfying. I've never felt so irritated at a book for this reason. I don't mind endings that leave you thinking about the characters and what they could be doing. In this case, there's nothing left to wonder about. I wish I could have chosen a different book instead."
5,Heartbreaking and Heartwarming,"This is my first book by Kristin Hannah and I really enjoyed it. I had a difficult time putting it down. I felt compassion for Julia immediately and the love she showed and taught Alice was so touching. The storyline although sad, was beautifully written. The characters were portrayed well and developed nicely throughout the story. I liked how the author introduced each character and throughout the book the character's own story/issue was played out. This book offered hope and a happy ending, which I like in a novel. I was left with wanting a few more details about certain things, but I still thought this was an excellent read!!!"
3,Kind of slow but touches the heart,"This book was honestly tough to stick with. The story moved slowly but had me hooked with wanting to know how and if Alice would find a home and adjust to normalcy. Characters were built beautifully, and had me interested from the first page, I just wish the story had moved a little quicker."
4,"Yep, MAGICAL",Thanks Maryann :) It was worth every penny. And unlike Home Front. I finished it in just two weeks! Maybe Kristin will make a sequel to this one. There is so much more potential for this story!
2,Disappointing and predictable,"This novel was a selection of my book club and as such it was a letdown. While you could classify the book as a ""good read,"" so is a lot of mass market fiction. The characters are not well developed, and the author doesn't portray them subtly or fully enough for you to care about them. The plot as well as the writing is cliche-ridden, and the ending is pat. It is clear early on that the sisters will mend their relationship, find true love, and all will work out in the end. If you are looking for a recent, well-written book about sisters with more interesting plots and characterization, and a nice dose of humor, try Case Histories by Kate Atkinson or Rise and Shine by Anna Quindlen. A second-tier Anna Quindlen book is sharp, funny, and better written than most premiere efforts by other writers."
5,A Special Story,I loved this book. It was so moving at the end I could feel the tears streaming down my cheeks. I always wanted to read on because I couldn't figure out how everything would tie together. I have recommended this book to many because I truly feel it is a teriffic read!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,uptown 4 life by unlv,"its ashame that amazon has not gotten this cd for a better price than 79.00, great cd bad price."
5,very good,u.n.l.v. is great lil ya of unlv will be dropping real soon are you all going to carry it and why don't ya'll carry all unlv cd's
3,Lots of Dropouts,"Prior to using the 83MQ I had been using Panasonic's shorter version, the AY DV63MQ. Since this appears to be no longer available either on Amazon or on eBay I moved into the longer version, but since doing so, with almost every tape I've used so far, I'm getting large dropouts. I haven't done any editing yet, so I don't know how many frames are dropped, but with almost every tape I've done, while playing them back through a video monitor, I see large black holes in the middle of a scene where the picture suddenly disappears and there is nothing. I've never had this before with any tape that I've used, so I don't know whether it's the tape's problem specifically or that the camera is having a problem adjusting from one type to another -- something that does occur in switching brands, but not nearly this seriously. You wouldn't think that switching from one Panasonic master series to another would have such an effect."
3,It's alright I guess,"Nothing is really wrong with it. It just seems kinda cheap, which it is cheap(cost), so maybe I'm being too hard. It works for me so...."
2,candy box,"I was so excited to get this box so I could share with my kids some of the candy that I used to get, but this candy was so hard and stale that I had to throw most of it away. There were a couple of things in the box that were ok but most of the candy wasnt worth what I paid for it. I would love to have some candy that would remind me of the old days, but I will have to order somewhere else so I can actually eat it."
3,"A welcome remembrance of Lehmann, with a spirited El Amor Brujo","Fritz Lehmann's career on disc has been largely overlooked in the U.S. except by specialty collectors. On the evidence of these unusual spanish and French recordings--unuual, that si, because they come form Berlin after the war--he shows considerable flair. I'd say on brief acquaintance that Lehmann could hold his own with such EMI stalwarts as Efrem Kurtz and Constantin Silvestri. His El Amor Brujo is vigorous and pointed, with singing from Diana Eustrati in a fiery, flamenco style. The Three-Cornered Hat excerpts are a bit tame by comparison but beautifully played.The Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun is delicately done, and it's followed by a lively Chabrier Espana that is in rather boxy sound. The Danse Macabre is the weakest thing here, showing little mood or vitality. In all, nothing here stands out as exceptional, but as a souvenir of Lehmann's studio output, this is a welcome CD."
3,FOR THE FANS,"I have to say I feel sorry for people who think this slick production is on a par with Michaels golden period of 1979 to 1992. This video is fun and interesting but lacks the essential magic that drove the world crazy with things like Moonwalker and The Bad Tour. Its all too slick and all too perfect. It has its good moments but really is only considered great by those kind of fans who have missed out on all the good old days hype. Ghosts is not something to make you jump for joy and the special gold CD single is good for 'On The Line"" but the other cuts just suck. A must have for any real fan but I'd rather watch that Bad Tour Documentary anyday, if only I still had it. I gave my Ghosts box set away, I kind of want it back but not much."
5,The 5 stars are for Michael! I luv you.,"I have NO clue if this ""Pal box set"" comes with the video. PLEASE can someone tell me. Does it come in VHS or DVD? I luv Michael. I am waiting to see this video. PLEASE let me know. Thanx."
3,Sad,"This is Frente singing about her boyfriend. It wasn't a very good song because she kept repeating the same words, and that gets annoying. The song made me feel sad, just the tone of her voice and the instrumental of the music. They're usually so happy - what happened?!"
5,"Jade, by Sally Watson, Has Been Republished by ImageCascade","Jade is now available from ImageCascade Publishing. New republication! A must read for readers of historical fiction! Sally Watson has a gift for presenting girls as feisty, strong-willed characters. Excellent role models for young readers, ages 10 to 15. Readers must also read Ms. Watson's Highland Rebel, Mistress Malapert, Lark, The Hornet's Nest."
5,A better way to show off little artist's masterpeices as opposed to taping to the wall.,"I love this product. My daughter feels very proud whenever we put up one of her pictures and I believe this helps her self esteem. She can say ""look what I did"" and we can put it up where everyone can see. The fridge holds only so many pictures on it and I find taping pictures to the wall leads to tears. You use the frames like you would a sheet protector with a sturdier plastic. The hanging itself kind of resembles a tarp like material. I haven't had to clean it yet, but it appears as though it would be easy to wipe off. While the frames are velcro and can be placed wherever, the velcro peices are placed so that you do need to have 3 vertical and 3 horizontal pictures."
3,less than I expected,"From the photos I thought this was a ""quilted"" material. I am sure somewhere it says that it is all plastic. Still, it is very cute and my kids love it. (I bought 2). However, this item, like another Alex product I recently ordered, looks as though it was exposed to heat over time. The plastic coverings for the pictures are warped and wrinkly. If I would have seen this in a store, I would not have purchased it for that reason, or at least I would have browsed through the items to find one that was not in this condition."
4,Cute wall art,"I bought this for my 4 and 2 year old daughters. My 4 year old kept wanting to tape her artwork to the walls in our playroom (and we just had them repainted!) This isn't the highest quality material, but it serves a good purpose and works well for showcasing my daughters' artwork. They love it (and I love that there is no more tape on my walls!)"
5,Dr. Stein's methods work extremely well - was able to stop medicating my child,"Who needs consultants and continuing psychological tests, etc., when you just need to parent correctly and consistently to get results for many children...My child was medicated for ADHD from 1st grade till 6th and using these techniques, we took him off his meds immediately and I literally, ""got my child back."" He was a mess - depressed, failing in school, a discipline nightmare, rude and someone, you just didn't want to be around...using the REST methods, we have a child that we never thought we would have. He isn't perfect (he is a teenager), but we and his teachers are amazed at the difference! A MUST READ FOR PARENTS OF ADD/ADHD children."
1,Dont buy this book,We were so impressed with the book after reading it that we went to visit Mr. Stein. He couldn't help our son and didn't have any useful recommendations. What a letdown!
5,Un gran disco,"Este es un gran disco de Héroes, es el primero de ellos, a pesar de que en este disco Enrique Bunbury aun no tenia tanta fuerza en la voz como en los discos posteriores, aquí están algunas de sus mejores canciones."
3,muy buen disco,"Primer disco de heroes, pero con una calidad tremenda, si no tienes el disco no sabes de lo que te pierdes."
5,Excellent use of contemporary methods for traditional design,"I have enjoyed working with this book. The paper foundations included are much easier to work with than if they were just printed on the book's pages. I did the Double Wedding Ring and the results were teriffic! This is paper piecing for people who are committed to doing traditional work with new methods, and it makes sense to combine the techniques. I have recommended it to my advanced students. Not for beginners! I only wish I hadn't forgotten who I loaned this book to, as now I have to buy another copy!"
3,Another Woman,"I saw the movie first and then purchased the book. The book is nothing like the movie, even the main character's name was changed from Leah(book) to Lisa (movie). I had hoped the book would fill in some gaps/questions I had about the movie, but I was wrong. Completely different storyline. To be honest, I liked the movie version better. I had a hard time bonding with the character in this book. She lied about everything. She was hot one minute, cold the next. I felt more empathy for the husband. I could not understand how she could become so sweet after she was beaten up when that did not seem to be a major part of her character before. I know it's fiction, but there has to be something for me to hold onto. She still should have reverted to the person she really was in the beginning before everything happened to her (beating caused amnesia). If you think the book will be like the movie, it is not. If it does not matter to you, could be a good read for you."
2,ok but...,"this book has too many distracting pictures, it comes across as a childrens book. The book is informative but needs some profesional work done to it. If you dont mind a picture book to learn about digestive problems, than this book is for you."
5,Excellent body system book,"This book has superb diagrams, pictures of body systems and information about caring for each system. Buy it! You won't find any better book on the topic."
5,Timely Insight on Brand Strategy and Customer Service,"This book uses personal examples from the 80's and 90's to illustrate the author's philosophical business approach. Rather than seeming `dated' the reader marvels at how relevant these lessons are for today. As CEO of SAS, Carlzon turned the beleaguered airline around in 24 historic months. He did this very simply by having a single-minded, service-driven brand strategy. What was unique, both then and now, was his commitment to the implementation of this strategy. EVERY single person in the organization, from the CEO to the mechanic screwing on lug nuts, was thoroughly briefed on the brand strategy and then trained on how to bring the service-driven concept to life. Carlzon transformed the organization from the inside out and reaped the rewards in the marketplace. An easy, worthwhile read."
4,Moments of Truth,In this new millenium it's funny to think how things used to be only 20 years ago. A lot of the principles of this book would be second nature now but it definitely highlights how you can develop a struggling business by focussing on what the customer wants - gee radical thinking!!I'm of the opinion that it's good to read about the past lest we forget and make the same mistakes - in life and in business.A good simple read but perhaps a little rose tinted. Left me wanting to know what happened in the late 80's (i.e. part 2).
5,Great price. Great power strip,"These side plug in power strips are made by Eaton Corp. (outsourced to China) and are the best I havefound to date for the money. I use this type of strip for plugging in easy switches to control various musicdevices and each strip will hold three easy switches and the wall wart (power supply) that it shuts on and off.Inline strips just don't do it.They are sturdy and mount well using pan head screws of the correct head diameter.I bought three, but would buy more if needed."
5,Excellent Quality & Service.,"Great customer service, quick delivery and excellent quality. I received my order 2 days after I purchased. About the drama: I've read some reviews comparing it to the F4 boys in the Boys over Flowers, which made me purchase this movie. It turned out to be different storyline and everything else, but it's still a great series."
4,Fun!,"This is a fun historical drama-comedy. I watched it without expectations, and was quickly drawn into the story. It's witty and intriguing, and there's romance, too, with plenty of comical misunderstandings and tension.The subtitles are good until the last two or three episodes, when whoever was translating seems to have been drunk or inattentive: fragmented sentences, incomplete thoughts, and just downright nonsense. However, the gist of story can still be inferred from the actors themselves and from the occasional subtitle that makes sense. (For a better set of subtitles, watch the series online on Hulu.)5 stars for the story, only 3 stars for the subtitles, so I give this 4 stars overall."
4,Very Addicting,"I recently saw an episode (someone around 12) on Korean TV (without subs) and thought it was intriguing despite the language barrier, so I searched around so I could watch it from the beginning.I found this show to be very addicting and their stopping points always left me needing to see the next part. The con to this is that they would replay the last few minutes at the beginning of the next episode which is obviously their way of saying, ""Last time on ...""Overall, there was drama (and I understand why Koreans call TV shows dramas, not shows), which is expected, but it didn't appear to be over the top until the end of the series. I was slightly disappointed as the beginning was very well-done. Still, I think you can say that about most TV shows, so I don't hold it against this one.I think if you like historical dramas, romantic comedies or are simply interested about Korean culture, this would be a good show to watch!"
4,jensen jpa285 amp,"I've owned this amp for about 2 yrs now and it never let me down. This is just a starter amp. sounds really good for 85 watts x2@ 4 ohms rms. I believe the outer shell is the heatsink because this amp never over heated in me while driving 2 S-DAT GF120 12S. If you want to be heard from blocks away this is not the amp for you,but if you want nice clean sound in your vechile that will gently vibrate your rearview mirror then this amp is for you.JENSEN JPA285 POWER AMP 425W - 2/1 CHANNEL"
3,An interview with Romare Bearden,"I am a great admirer of Romare Bearden and when I bought this book I wanted to learn more about him and his art. This book has great pictures but not quite the amount of information I was looking for. I wanted to learn more about Romare's life and the book focus on an interview with Romare Bearden and a brief overview of his life. I believe the author was thinking on the saying that ""pictures say a thousand words."""
2,I liked another one better,"The lens for this monocular is badly fisheye, resulting in dramatic and unnecessary distortion. Plus, the magnification is mediocre. We ordered the Yukon Spirit 4x50 at the same time, and though it's not perfect, we prefer -- and are keeping -- that one."
3,"Good unit for 1st generation, but ...","Being a first generation scope this is a good one, the IR beam has a good range of about 50 yards. But anyone will see you because the IR lamp is strong and glows red. Things are only sharp in the center of the image, but they look clear and you can identify easily anything up to 50 yards.I bought this to watch wildlife, but honestly a good flahlight will be as good or even better because you'll see it in color.My problem wit it is that I was using a military grade scope prior to this and any comparision is unfair ..."
2,Not good thru glass,Infrared beam does not work well viewing through window glass. Could not get a good answer from anyone as to whether or not there was a filter available.
2,Only if you've got money to blow.,"I purchased this item to check out the state of the art for amateur night vision gear. The item is extremely bulky for something that does so little. It also has a very cheap feel about it. Can't imagine carrying this around with me anywhere, it's just not very compact. The power button is also a little too stiff and requires a very deep push. The infrared lamp is absolutely necessary for seeing in those instances where the human eye cannot. As for low light, the monocular is useless. I can see better with my own eyes than through the lens.The seller was fine. The item reached me with packaging that looked a little worn, but it didn't matter considering the less than valuable contents within. Incidentally, the monocular came with a pouch which was unnecessary since I'm more than happy to kick it around the floor along with my socks."
1,"Incorrect translations, Over simplistic explanations.","This book was flimsy, 9 pages for 9.95, and four pages can be read online, so when you get the book, you feel that it was a complete waste of money. If you are experienced at all with China, don't get this. If you are going on a short business trip, and you don't know anything at all, go for it. But, BEWARE, the Chinese language translations were NOT correct. The most simple greetings ""hi"" and ""how are you"" were incorrect. Try to find a thicker more complete volume. The Lonely Planet guides are great."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"It is an absolute waste of money... the only thing I learned was not to buy anything from this company ever! The book is about 10 pages of text, that could easily be made into to 2 by taking out the spacing. The information is common sense, and you can find more by spending 3 minutes on any website. Do yourself a favor, and spend your money elsewhere!"
1,Not worth the money,"This little booklet of advice is really not worth the [money] it costs. It has very few pages, all in large type, providing very little valuable information. My advice, try a different book for learning this stuff."
2,Sheet Music incomplete,"The specification for this product says ""sheet music included"". In fact, the sheet music is included for only 5 of the songs out of 24. And, of course, not for the one I wanted."
5,Awsome and Instumental,This the most original instrumental bands I've ever heard. The songs flow beautifly one into another. A must own for lovers of instrumental energy.
4,WHAT DEEP BLUE SEA COULD HAVE BEEN,"A squad of genetically engineered mako sharks escape from their holding pen and turn the seas red with their insatiable wrath. Sound familiar? Yes, it's the same plot as the acceptable ""Deep Blue Sea,"" but handled years earlier and far more adroitley by novelist William R. Dantz. Dantz's characters breathe with realism and the electric prose makes his mako's jump off the page at you. Solid, unheralded page-turner compares favorably to Peter Benchley's ""Jaws"" and definitely deserves to be back in print. Marred only slightly by a subtle left-wing subtext. Exciting, colorful thriller with a heart. Recommended to fans of undersea thrillers, suspense stories, or anyone who could use a quick but satisfying read."
3,Overrated,"This book is highly overrated. There's no issues with the writing style. In fact, it's written quite well and set up nicely, which is why it's frustrating to know how good the book COULD have been. Two marine biologists (one of them a wannabe novelist, always an annoying character trait in a horror book) are distraught over the behavior of their trained dolphins. They eventually learn it's because the dolphins know there are genetically altered mako sharks on the loose. It's not a bad concept, but there are very few shark attacks. There's even a lengthy set-up for an attack that doesn't even happen. Most of the story's focus is on the dolphins and a conspiracy that the reader will easily figure out long before the truth is revealed. The book kept my interest, but I kept hoping it would get better by throwing in some more shark attacks. I felt rather cheated by the end. I'm torn between giving the book 2 stars and a generous 3 because there were aspects that I liked."
4,it was pretty good.,"Well, deep blue sea, copied off of this book.yes, these are large mako sharks (finally someone had the decency to move away from great whites)so they basically.......... put the intellegence of dolphin, in like six mako sharks.It was good. it wasn't much better than deep blue sea, (a movie i enjoyed)but this was pretty good."
5,Everyday Things,"Harms writes poems that find magic in the mundane of everyday life. On the surface, one sees relationships with others and events that are not earth shaking; however, the power of poetry -- or any writing, for that matter -- rests solely in details. His poems are filled carefully wrought images brimming with subtlety and understatment. Many poets have problems with the universal. Many poets try to address the whole complexity of human experience, which results in abysmal failure. Harms avoids this, as his poetry is far from epic. Yet, the best way to speak to a larger issue is focus on a smaller story. Harms does this and more."
4,Useful guide for people who feel they need change,"What I liked in this book is that it focuses on many different areas people usually don't think about when they want to make the change. It is a good analysis and it is flowing very easy, without too many stupid overestimations that are common in other self-help books.I would recommend it to everybody to read."
2,...,"Book contains a wealth of information, but is overwritten and contains numerous extraneous rabbit-trails of information from the author that are more opinion than fact."
2,Rosemary Clooney missing ... arrangements not the usual!,"If you're a fan of either ""Holiday Inn"" or ""White Christmas"" you really, really should avoid this one. Its recording quality not only offers substandard ""tin can"" sound, but you won't find Rosemary Clooney on a single track from White Christmas.This is not a soundtrack. It's a studio version of songs that sound familiar from the movies but were not performed this way on screen.Disappointing to say the least, as me and mine are avid fans of these Christmas-themed films. The two stars I've placed here are generous, but I couldn't move down to one ... ""hate"" doesn't fit. I am, however, not keeping this CD. Too depressing and not at all what I hoped to hear.If you're a true fan of the films, these recordings won't be what you hope to hear, either.Good luck in finding the real thing!"
3,Would be 5 stars if Rosemary Clooney were on it,"It's a nice cd for fans of the movie, but since Rosemary Clooney was under contract with another record label they replaced her with Peggy Lee on the soundtrack. Peggy Lee was a great singer, but her style is very different and it just doesn't have the same feel."
2,OK,"Enjoy some of the CD, thought it would be the soundtrack with all of them singing together but was a little disappointed with the way they did the music and have seperate songs."
1,Not the same soundtrack as the movies! Remember this,"This CD is not the same music played in the two musicals by Irving Berlin. But MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT IS NOT PERFORMED BY THE STARS IN THE MOVIE. Many times when you buy a classic movie cd - Its performed by the original stars and although the music on the cd is not directly from the movie - it is still a very good studio recording. (This is the case with ""Robin and the 7 Hoods"") BUT this cd falls woefully short. Nothing on this cd reminds you of the movies they represent.I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING IT - YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. I bought it as a present for a friend who knows her movies. I would be embarassed to give her this cd. She will notice as others will, that this is just a knock-off cd.It is really false advertising."
2,What a Disappointment!!!!!!!!,"As a 21 year old, I felt a little out of place buying this soundtrack. But, I was so excited that I had finally found a soundtrack to these two wonderful movies. Imagine my disappointment when I could aurally pick out that Rosemary Clooney's parts were not sung by Rosemary Clooney! I DO NOT recommend buying this album. Enjoy the music when you watch the movies, instead. Trust me, it's better that way!"
2,Disappointing! NOT a soundtrack to the beloved movie,"Like Amy Mattey's review below, I agree....this is NOT the soundtrack to the movie I was expecting. If you've watched the movie (White Christams) over and over, year after year like I have, you'll be able to tell right away that this is not the music from the movie. Save your money and try to find a way to pull the original music off the DVD!"
3,Busted............,"Both speakers arrived broken inside an undamnaged shipping box. I suspect these are returns or seconds being resold with little concern about quality. Full, immediate, refund kept me happy though."
5,Quite Informative!,"Most of us know we live in an imperfect system and that our laws can seem silly at times making our lives a bit difficult. This book takes that little glow of what we think and illuminates the whole room with it. You can not imagine how screwed up our laws are and how counter-intuitive they are at serving the people, which is their purpose right? From preventing nuns from building homeless shelters, not fixing leaking dams that end up causing billions of dollars worth of damage, to taking 20 years to test the safety of insecticides for use on our crops, this book will open your eyes to the nonsensical system that is our government. A book every citizen of the US should read, for the common person it is eye-opening, for an intelligent person looking to work in this system of law it reveals the true insanity you will expose yourself to."
5,Crushing burden of law,Mr Howard explains in laymen's terms how the huge edifice of law and regulation is suffocating our country.I will purchase other titles by this author.
4,Not what I expected,A little too much leagalese for me. I expected more like a comedy format. This is more case law & documentary. However it is pretty good if that is the kind of book you want. Personally I wanted more humor.DON
1,Save your money--this book reeks!,"After reading the other reviews for this book, I thought I'd give the book a try, but boy! what a dud!!! After having read the book, and then re-read the reviews posted here, one really has to wonder if the author isn't writing his own reviews here on Amazon in an effort to boost sales of his book.....Poorly written and VERY amateurish--no wonder the author had to pay the publisher to get this drivel published!! Save your money and choose a quality book from the Amazon site, not this rubbish penned by Eden....."
1,Poorly written and boorish,"What a really, really bad book! Extremely bland, dull, and uninteresting. Wish I could get a refund!!"
2,How does this stuff get published???,Definitely one of the worst books I've ever read! I've been trying to dump it on eBay but nobody wants it. Don't believe the good reviews--this book is a joke!
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money!,"Simply put, this is the worst book I've ever read!! Very amateurish and poorly written, I kept looking for the line ""it was a dark and stormy night...."" After reading the book, it would appear that the author has lived his life by moulding shreds of truth and mountains of fiction in an attempt to fabricate an existence for himself that hides his impovershed upbringing and current status as a washed-up B movie actor desperate for the limelight. The chapters on his sailing experiences were trite, cliche, and frankly unbelievable--and the rest of the book is little more than yet another ""hollywood tell-all"" book by someone obviously frustrated and bitter by a failed acting career. While Eden may be a legend in his own mind, by his own admission you can't believe a word he says. Do yourself a favor and avoid this ..."
3,"Good, but not the best in a market with many to choose from","The empasis in particular on career growth through lifelong improvement as a developer instead of through transitions to management is crucial. I've seen way too many folks allow themselves to stagnate intellecually and then try to get promoted by moving into management, since they see that as the only avenue left to them.However, the reason for the relatively low rating is that _The Pragmatic Programmer_ is a good deal better; Pragmatic is both more approachable in simple chunks for those who can't sit down and read it cover to cover and covers a few aspects of development and lifestyle that Craftsmanship avoids."
3,I expected more,"I'm disappointed. I expected more from this book. Being that I want to become a software craftsman (more on software.kubasek.com), I thought this book is going to give me a fairly clear direction on how to get there. There are some bits and pieces of it, but not very convincing.What I did not like about this book, is that the author is a craftsman himself, but he wrote in 3rd person. If this was based on his experiences, if this book was more personal, it would have been more convincing. It would have been a lot more interesting. Even though I believe in software craftsmanship, I don't necessarily agree with bashing software engineering in favor of craftsmanship. I belive both fit together well.Don't get me wrong, you'll find some useful information in this book (that's why I give it 3.5 stars), but overall it is just a light treatment of Software Craftsmanship."
3,Beautiful watch no doubt,"Its a beautiful watch, but you expect the strap to be better. Dont be fooled when the product says clip, its not one of those clips that come on Metal straps, its a boring old style clip with holes on one strap and fastener on the other. Crummy strap spoils the look, otherwise the dial looks classy, picture perfect."
5,Great Book For Children...and others,"I'm not sure about the modern printing. However, I recently came across a copy my brother got as a gift in the early 80's. I started reading it and was amazed at how good it was. I will certainly give copies to my young relatives. Actually, I learned some things from the book! It doesn't assume stupidity in children and really answers their questions and gets them to think. Certainly a better gift than video-games or DVDs."
2,Good Idea Poorly Executed,"My son and I love to read topics at random, but the writing is poor. This is probably 5th grade level coverage. The authors try to cover too much of each topic in too short of space, resulting in unfocused and uninteresting explanations. I'm going to look at the following books to replace this one: ""Why?: The Best Ever Question and Answer Book About Nature, Science, and the World Around You (Hardcover"" and ""How Come? Every Kid's Science Questions Explained (Paperback)"""
2,Disappointed,I guess I just expected more from this book than what I got. I was hoping for a little more in exercises and direction.
5,Burgess's best-kept secret,"I didn't want to read this book. It was attached to a copy of ""A Clockwork Orange"" and I figured I might as well. The whole time, I felt both compelled and repelled to go on. However, I loved it more than ""A clockwork Orange,"" and am currently trying to find out more about it. Burgess uses an interesting plot that puts full emphasis on causality and contains many twists and turns that were comical and intriguing. I found myself alternately loving and hating Paul, the main character. The thing that I love about it the most is that what appears is a simple plot is really a statement of burgess's personal resentment for the state. If you're a political kind of person, or you want to learn, this is a great, insightful book."
3,Okay product..,"The taste was okay, but different. The product was not bad, but I just doubt that I'd order these again. They actually do taste like pickles, which is good, but the taste is definitely an acquired one and I haven't acquired it yet."
3,great presentation- but very basic!,"This video is put together really well. It makes learning HTML very easy for anyone. However, it is also really basic. I was shocked at how much they didn't cover in the video. If you are just learning how to program then this is a good start. But if you know the basics already, i would pass this one up."
4,Amazon's Gives Good Service Again...,"I haven't had time to watch it yet. However, I did receive it in a timely manner."
3,"Good book about the American West, but too little info","When I bought ""The American Frontier"", I was doing a History Fair project about the exploration and settling of the American West. When I found it here, I decided to buy it because it looked like it covered the time periods I needed. Although it did, it didnt go into the kind of info I really needed, but I did use it to help me because it had tons of graphics in it. If you love cowboys, though, you should think about getting this book."
4,If you like the first CD II will grow on you like fungas,"The lyrics are great, the bass beat is great and i think that II is one of the better CDs in my collection i highly reccommend this CD to any one who likes the Presidents."
2,Not White,"The opals in this bracelet are green not white, and not well matched. I returned it. Length 7 3/8"", width 5/16""."
1,Be aware.,"The item I received was not the item pictured.It has a very different chain link design from the one pictured and the opals are set in a different direction.The clasp is strange and hard to to take off without force.The ""genuine diamond accent"" is one microscopic stone haphazardly slopped on.As for the diamond itself, despite its size i could see that the stones cut is horrible.It looks like it was cut with a hammer.I may smash a drinking glass on the floor and replace the ""genuine diamond accent"" with a broken shard for a cleaner look.But that's what i get for buying jewelry online,One gets what one pays for."
1,Self Praise Is No Praise,"Full disclosure here - I could not bring myself to finish this arrogant and bloated memoir. Pages and pages of lavish self-praise followed by childish backstabbing of just about everyone else who worked on the Ground Zero project becomes tiresome very quickly. And the book is written in the language and style of a college admission essay - extended lists of perceived accomplishments, but with the self-absorbed, giddy presentation of a seventeen year old lacking maturity or perspective. Libeskind may be the colorful sort of personality that gossip columnists love, but his writing is vacuous and the book is largely superficial. I was dubious about Libeskind before getting this book. Now I see why so many consider him a shallow, self-important buffoon."
1,Weak Stuff,"Last time I checked, whinging was not the stuff of great men. Maybe it was the ghost writer who helped bring out Libeskind's inner wuss. For some reason this very sissyish book seems more like a dumb, trashy biography of Jessica Simpson or Anna Nicole. All of the malicious whining about the guys who bettered Libeskind in architectural competitions just seems unmanly, definitely not the stuff of professional role-models. (Maybe because he is so insecure, he also feels the need to remind us that he beat Izthak Perlman in a musical competition over forty years ago.) At best, this is a lightweight, hokey sort of memoir, but mostly it is an unbalanced, miserable and selfish book. Libeskind needs to grow up before he starts telling other people how great he thinks he is!!!"
3,Here's the Sandwich but where's the Meat?,"If readers were to look for a cerebral architectural book, this book isn't it. This book read like an autobiography and it didn't go in-depth describing Daniel's conceptualisation of his major works. It is really interesting to read about Daniel's grievances of his fellow professionals. The title of the book said it all, Breaking Ground (Zero). He explained his rationales for having the building at a specific height and orientation. The third quarter of the book concentrated on the battle between the idealist and the realist (developer against Daniel) of David versus Goliath proportion. Anyhow, I wouldn't say I was enlightened after reading this book but suffice to say that it gave me hope that if we were to stick to our dream persistently, we would get our dream eventually. For serious architectural enthusiast, Stephen Holl offers far more cerebral works. Commendable reading especially for in-flight!"
1,Ego-tripping on Steroids,"A brief synopsis of Breaking Ground: In the first half of the book, Libeskind more-or-less says - Hi, I'm Danny and I am all-round brilliant, my mother was a genius, my wife is a genius and my ancestors were great heroes. The world needs me and deserves my greatness. - In the second half of the book, Daniel seems to suggest that all other architects are barely talented enough to design toilets; that many clients are ignorant philistines; that Germans are stupid, and, that Museum Directors / clients are not worthy of his talent. He wraps up suggesting that life has taught him a lot and, with a bit of effort, you (the reader) could learn from and be like him. - After reading this book I was happy to accept that I'm completely unlike him."
1,"A whiny, thumb-sucking rant.",A whole book of kvetching and moaning about how he was out-politicked and outmaneuvered by a more experienced architectural firm.And take those stupid glasses off.
1,Confessions of An Airhead,"Like Paris Hilton's recently published `Confessions of an Heiress', Libeskind's equally insipid (and arguably much dumber) book, is an appallingly tasteless and opportunistic publicity gimmick by someone who just isn't smart enough to recognize their own limitations. Shoddily written, ""Breaking Ground"" tries to ""dumb down"" architectural design for a lowest-common-denominator audience. But a sort of bossy haughtiness gets in the way, and Libeskind will probably insult the intelligence of anyone who suffers through this supercilious nonsense. His hyper-inflated sense of his own self-importance was unbearable after just a few crass and aimless chapters. (I decided that life was too short to waste time finishing it.) Given Libeskind's predilection for shameless self-promotion, can a reality TV series (a lá The Osbornes), starring Danny and Nina Libeskind be far off? The Comedy Chanel might be interested ....."
1,A Loser's Loser,It takes a small man to build a big tower. And it takes a small mind to write a big book of b....
1,Terrible Book,"Patronizing, dreadful, insincere, badly written book. I cut my losses after about four chapters of this fool's memoir. I don't recommend it."
4,Breaking Ground,"Daniel Liebskind designed the new wing of my local (Denver) art museum, and to coincide with its opening, my book club chose to read ""Breaking Ground."" In reading the book I was expecting to gain a little insight into who this man is and possibly how he came up with some of his ideas. But I never expected to find that he is a very good writer, incredibly well-read, and to learn of the amazing thought processes behind his designs (e.g. the Twin Towers Memorial among others world-wide). It was a wonderful surprise and a book I will read again some day."
1,"Super-Sized Ego, but not much else","Partway through this book, I read a magazine article about how Libeskind had to hire another architectural firm to design his New York City apartment and it opened my eyes for the rest of the book. Libeskind seems very resentful of any other architect who is genuinely professional and talented and most of this book is just a tool to discredit any competitor he has come up against. I've never seen so many nasty comments about other people in a single autobiography. His super-sized vanity gets hard to stomach after just a few chapters. Reading this book about Daniel Libeskind's ideas on architecture was about as useful as, say, reading Rick and Cathy Hilton's ideas about raising a daughter well. The poor results and lack of any integrity prove the point. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this, so I do not recommend it."
3,"I guess you get what you pay for.. and, it was a cheap one.","I would not recommend this item in fact i returned it. the removable pedicure attachments are useless, they dont vibrate spin nothing. the vibrations arent strong and the bubbles just splash every where. it does not maintain heat so if you put HOT water in the bath, within 10-20 minutes your water is cold. i would save your time and money and search for something better."
2,Save your money.,"I purchased this footbath in an effort to help my perpetually sore feet. Unfortunately, after my first use, i found out that the ""massaging"" attachments do absolutely nothing for my feet, and the footbath leaves much to be desired (i.e. not enough relaxing bubbling action on the feet). The water often goes cold after about 8 minutes. I tried to return the footbath to the store where i bought it, only they refused to accept it because i had used it once, so it has become a dust collector in my bathroom closet. My suggestion would be to save your money and buy a higher quality footbath."
2,it's okay,"it's just on okay product. like the reviews i read before i bought it said, the water doesn't stay warm very long. the heater in the tub only slightly warms the bottom of your feet. but it was inexpensive, so you get what you pay for."
1,soap opera-ish,"Beware - herky-jerky, irksome handheld camera used for no purpose. Gawd, that's irritating.I got this because I love Naomi Watts and Sean Penn, but they are wasted on this melodrama where everyone cannot just talk, but must be moving around like headless chickens as they deliver their lines. And, somehow, brushing her teeth causes Watts (Plame_) to break down in tears. And, Sooty Libby is no doubt a sleazeball, but I doubt that he's always-sneering sleazeball.I'm going to avoid this director like super-halitosis from now on."
3,Great acting from Watts ..... fair acting from Penn ..... but ......,"Great acting from Naomi Watts.Fair to medium acting from Sean Penn (suffers from some excess). He usually does better.The story is of course loosely (VERY LOOSELY) based on recent events.The film suffers from the ""Sean Penn Fanatical Preaching Obsession"" he seems to have fallen into in recent years.He is so consumed by some of his political views he can't see straight at times it seems and it adversely affects his movie making.It seems he is only concerned with making political propoganda films these days at the exclusion of all else.That is fine if that is all he is interested in now, but don't be surprised if fewer and fewer people get too motivated to see his movies.I imagine that despite the good acting, this movie will go un-noticed and fade away into obscurity without too much attention or discussion."
1,Worse Kept Secret,It was known all over DC that Plame was a CIA operative. I spent a week in DC doing research and knew about it... Then a few months later she's 'outed'. The movie is based off her mainly fictional and self-serving account villainizing everyone except herself and her husband; then it becomes a Penn vehicle. Watts did a great job considering what she had to work with but the movie did drag in places and Penn couldn't act out of a wet paper sack. Even disregarding inaccuracies in Plame's own story and even more by the screenplay there was no saving this movie. Wooden and Booring.
3,Great Story and world's worst cinematography,"The able acting and excellent script and storyline are undone by the most excessive, unnecessary shakey cam, hand-held camera style shooting ever recorded. This style seems useful to me as a way to communicate short scenes of action or confusion, but it gets downright annoying with Fair Game... This is a political suspense docudrama...not an episode of office or Nascar...wtf?!? I got a headache watching Valerie Plame's head bob in and out of my screen. Complete imitative nonsense.What a pointless exercise."
1,Don't waste 2 hours of your life.,"The worst movie ever made. Only made it halfway through before quitting trying to watch the movie. This movie is considered an action movie and is far from it, all that's in the movie is talking. Nothing in the movie is exciting or interesting at all. It would make any talk show host look good. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE WATCHING THIS!"
1,Fair Game,"I give this film one star for being .999% pure political propaganda. Perfect movie for Communist Penn. He loves to drag America through the mud.I esspecially hated the part where Penn is constanly berating his companions when they have an opinion about the crisis on the news. It screams ""shut up average americans"" because your opinions are just based on racism and ignorant anger; and people like you need to let societies politacally motivated elite handle these complicated matters.This is an elitist lefties dream movie."
1,dishonest garbage,"we knew sean penn was a loon, but when you consider the degree of the lies in the movie and also consider how relatively soon after the scandal this movie was made, it's shocking how much disregard the film shows the truth. as if there isn't detailed information all over the internet to refute the lies. no valerie plame story would be complete without dick armitage and it's almost as if he doesn't exist. so i guess this was a fun little dress up movie for sean penn and hopefully naomi watts isn't part of the leftist scum brigade in hollywood."
2,I Hate to Agree,"""Fair Game"" is about a serious criminal event that occurred during the Cheney Administration. It deserved a far better presentation; it needed less chaotic direction and a male star who didn't bull his way through the role. I hate to agree with those who dislike this film because it tells a politically disagreeable truth that they don't want known, but it just isn't very good. The one star above the minimum is for Naomi Watts for showing up in front of the cameras."
2,"DOUG LIMAN, OPUS 7","** 1/2 I really don't know what differentiates Fair Game from a good TV movie. Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Sam Shepard maybe. Otherwise, one may rejoice that a democracy like the U.S.A. can still produce movies about its administration's hiccups. Now that everyone is happy and has a good conscience, why not regret a time, not so distant after all, that allowed such directors as Alan J. Pakula, Sydney Pollack or John Frankenheimer to direct much more powerful films ? This one is already forgotten. Unfortunately."
4,A GOOD POLITICAL TALE,Based on the Plame affair and adapted from her memoirs. Tale focuses on a non James Bond CIA operative who is betrayed by people within the White House. Sean Penn's acting was better than usual. Themes of integrity were done well enough but not to the point of becoming sappy. People interested in politics or who want to have another reason to hate on George W. Bush (like we need more reasons) will want to check this one out. The actor who portrayed Scooter Libby (that would be David Andrews) did a really good job as a jerkus maximus. The authenticity of this tale is still being debated but most seem to believe Plame. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; THEMES: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; MY GRADE: B to B plus.
3,Fair Game:the movie,"The movie was just ok, the previews made it seem like there was going to be much more action. I read the book and it was fairly close."
3,3 of 5,"This movie, based on a memoir by former CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson, seems to have its political views in the right place. That is, it's not afraid to portray the United States government as the corrupt organization it often is. The main focus goes back to the weeks, months and years after ""9-11″ and the questionable war that started as a result. But the plot, which plays around Valerie's sudden termination from the CIA; the result of her ambassador husband publically denying that Saddam Hussein is using ""yellowcake"" to make weapons; doesn't really untangle itself until about the half-way point. From there, this Fair Game is two people versus the government in what is ultimately anything but.marcellee.com"
4,Entertaining,This movie was a pleasant surprise. I was surprised to learn it did relatively poorly at the box office. This is one that I plan to enjoy on multiple occasions.
3,Complex Story,A complex story already which they have tried to make more suspenseful with the introduction of a subplot surrounding nuclear scientists in Iraq. It's interesting to see the effects of this story on the personal lives of the Wilsons but generally this movie doesn't add anything more than is already known ... and actually is hard to follow if you don't know the story.
5,Hot Sizzling bubbly Raclette! ! Bubbly Bubbly..............,Put in under a Reclette grill or just put it in your oven for 5-10 minutes. Serve with boiled baby potaotes and cornichons. You will be melted by the Raclette aroma and your melted velvelty bubbly Raclette. Experience that you cannot forget!!!
2,Raw milk raclette cheese,This cheese was bitter and very hard to slice. I didn't like it. I wouldn't buy it again but will try another type of raclette cheese.
5,Great book for ages 8 and up,"Very simple, matter of fact, and the language used is easy for children to understand. There are no graphic pictures of adults having sex; it just shows a man and woman together under a blanket in bed. No adult body parts are seen although the couple appear to be naked. This book is a good starting point for the whole discussion of this topic."
3,"Boys, Girls &Body Science","I ordered this book based on the great reviews it recieved. However after I read this bjook I do not feel it is appropriate for my 8 year old daughters. I will put it away until they are a year or two older and continue looking for the ""perfect"" book."
2,Definately explains birds and bees,It is written in a very child like way...in the style for a 6-7 year old...but if you want a cartoon picture of a naked man and women embracing under the covers...this is the book for you! Not quite what I was looking for.
4,"Wonderful voice, wish there was more to listen to...","After listening to samples provided on her website, Origa does not disappoint with this release. A little on the mellow side, this CD is great listening when you just need to chill awhile. The second track ""Diva"" is my current favorite with a faster pace. However, with total running time around 35 minutes, I wish there was more."
2,Not Really Worth It,"I have heard Origa before on youtube especially for her hit for the anime series Ghost In The Shell. I expected that type of music on this album. I was really not impressed, I honestly though the artists could still blend that special blend of techno and orchestra into this album, apparently not."
5,Nikko China,"We bought two sets of this china set, since this was the best value.The plates are simply designed yet this makes them look very classy.We have not tried the china setting on the dishwasher, we only hand wash them.They dress up the table very nicely and this set is enough for a fancy meal.the packaging was very efficient. I was quite worried to receive chipped pieces, but Amazon did a fantastic job."
1,lantern review,I don't recommend this itemI had problems with the on/off botton for the first time to turned onFinally it's turned on but I need to fix it
1,One-Sided View from a Bitter Person,I did not agree with a single thing in this book. I have had successful bariatric surgery & do not think that scaring people away from a potentially life-saving surgery is a good idea. There are alternatives to the RnY surgery that can be explored and are better for many people.
2,Successful Patient of Gastric Bypass,"Sorry to hear that Dani had such a difficult time and had to get a reversal, but this is a unique extreme situation. There are lot more success stories then reversals. I had the operation in December and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I certainly don't think it's easier to live with morbid obesity then it is to take a chance and improve your life. I guess some people will relate to Dani's story, but majority of the patients who had successful gastric bypass will not and it's a shame to deter anyone considering the operation."
2,More research needed,I totally disagree with some of Dani's comments regarding the fact that there is no information available for WLS surgery. I belong to a support group Obesity.help which has tons of information on the surgery. It contains information on the risks of the surgery as well as many different message boards where others share their experience...good or bad!
3,Great Fax Machine,This is a great fax machine for my needs but if you get a lot of faxes DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT THAT IS WHY I RATED 3 STARS.
5,"Oh c'mon, this is a wonderful slice of advertising history",This is a classic and extremely fun book and look at the image of men through advertising during the 60s and 70s. Anyone interested in visual presentation of cultural values and gender would be interested in this book. Also fabulous for the male gay market with many appealing pictures. Great for women too. Highly recommend.
2,The Macho Man Revisted,"The Male Mystique offers an illuminating study of the ""real man"" archetype on which so many of us guys were raised: a hostile, arrogant, emotionally crippled ninny, slowly destroying himself with booze and cigarettes while being fawned over by non-threatening, sexually compliant child-women who somehow manage to be even dumber than he is. Not a pretty picture. However, the most disturbing element of the book lies in the author's attitude: Boyreau seems to regard Madison Avenue's monstrosity as admirable and romantic, an ideal to be cherished. His pretentious text is mercifully brief."
4,Es excelente si eres fan de Fey,"El cd contiene la mayoria de sus exitos... aunque creo que deberian de haber hecho algun remix o algunas nuevas versiones incluidas como premio, aunque tengo entendido que en este cd Fey ya no tuvo nada que ver, tan solo se encargaron de sacar lo que ya tenia sony y volverlo a poner. El dvd esta excelente en cuanto a los videos, aunque kreo ke le falto alguna presentacion o algun mensaje especial o una minibiografia... pero eso si: la presentacion del DVD , es decir , los menus interactivos y la fotografia estan PESIMOS!! hasta pareciera que lo hicieron gente inexperta, o aprendices... pero si te gusta Fey, definitivamente no puedes dejar de comprarlo."
5,Excellent resource,"This was a repurchase after losing the book a few years ago.It's great resource for understanding how food works with your body and providing common sense, reasonable food choices."
5,Get a copy today!,"""Lean Bodies"",I do believe these words to ring true. I've kept the fat offever since I read the book, the second time."
1,Bland and uncreative recipes,"Although the other books Cliff has authored are good, I found that the majority of mock meals and recipes in this book utilized yogurt and egg-whites as the base. Being that egg-whites and yogurt are two of only a small handfew of foods that I cannot eat. This made the book's usefullness and desire quite limited for me - being that the fact that so many recipes relied on these two items. Being an exercise buff (hockey, skiing, biking, rollerblading, weights, etc.) I realize the important of eating many smaller meals a day instead of two or three large ones. I found that this book did not compliment my needs or tastes. I feel that anyone can create a recipe program/book for themselves w/o the use of this book."
4,Dunno,"This is the book howard stern used to lose all the weight for the cover of his book ""private parts&quot"
4,Unpleasant But...,"The author recounts many unpleasant facts. Actually he buries the reader under a mountain of facts and documentation about the conflict in Liberia, so much so that you get the eerie feeling of becoming numb to the violence. That being said, he redeems himself by offering some very solid pearls of wisdom about U.S. foreign policy and how it made, destroyed, and can restore this war-ravaged West African country. I am glad I persevered to the end."
3,Liberia: Portrait of a Failed State,In state as advertised. Will do business with this seller again. Book could have been delivered earlier though; I'm going to chalk the delay to the holiday.
2,Scott Adams is Running Out of Gas,"This compilation of Dilbert comic strips from 1998-1999 begins to show the decline in the humor and quality of the strip. I know that when I have read Dilbert in the newspaper the past couple of years, I haven't laughed much compared to five or so years ago when Scott had me howling. Seeing all the strips together just supports that opinion. I don't know if the strip's reduced quality is due to the fact that Scott has been away from the corporate ratrace for several years and has lost touch with all the idiocy (he gets most of his ideas now from readers) or whether he has focused his energies on other aspects of the Dilbert world (TV show, marketing) that he doesn't focus on the strip like he used to do.This is a good book to have if you are a Dilbert book completest, but if you want to laugh get an earlier Dilbert strip compilation book instead."
1,Rip-off!,Did anyone else buy Random Acts of Management and Excuse Me While I Wag on kindle and find they are EXACTLY the same?!A total rip-off by Scott Adams! Unbelievable.
4,Another Dilbert Bible,"A perfect laugh-along for all managers such as myself. If you got the dough, buy the book!I just hope that they won't be re-used in future books..."
5,Awesome and Refreshing acapella Christmas,"This is a must have for those who enjoy acapella/barbershop quartet style music. It is also a wonderful additioon to any Christmas collection. The harmonies and blending as well as the fresh approach to many of your favorite Christmas standards.The track ""Cool Yule"" is by far the best version of that song I believe I have ever heard."
5,Beautiful performances,"The performances on this CD are wonderful. The musicians are true to the performance practices of the day. The mixing is good. The harpsichord can be heard clearly, as can the low register of the gamba. I've heard many versions of the Pièces de Clavecin en Concerts, including a horrendous sounding one by Jean-Pierre Rampal and Isaac Stern (great musicians, but stay away from Rameau with your metal flute, your rabid vibrato, and your A440s), and this is THE one to get."
5,knob backplate,"These backplates are high quality, and cover the scratches made around the knobs by fingers on our cabinets. The brass is high quality....make the cabinets look like new. Would purchase again."
4,The item is good the seller is terrible!,Never got items had to wait a month for refund...2nd bad expieience with same vender. Consider removing them from reseller list!
3,The first one is better :-(,"I got the first one (Get your Passport) for my 4 year old nephew. He loves it. He asks to see it everyday and he dances and sings during the entire show. So I got him the second one. Its ok but he does not like the songs as much, does not dance and doesnt ask to see it so often. I watched it with him and agree that the songs are not as ""cool"" as the first one."
5,excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best, the most comprehensive, and the most professional and straightforward source on vaccines that I have ever read or heard!!!! It is EXTREMELY WELL worth the money!!!"
2,Not worth the money!,Wish the detailed description mentioned it was a lecture that had been taped. It is very dry and the speaker is extremely boring. I wouldn't pay to attend this lecture in person let alone watching on DVD at home.
3,Be careful with sizing!,"This is a nice product, just be careful with the sizing. My son wears a size 12 jeans and weighs about 90 pounds, he needs a size medium pants. I had trouble finding the sizing chart and ordered the wrong size. Also, the belt isn't a ""true"" belt in that it doesn't go all the way around the pants so you can't buy a larger size and just tighten the waist."
3,RAN VERY SMALL,"I PURCHASED THESE PANTS AND THEY WERE NOT TRUE TO SIZE. I WOULD PURCHASE THEM AGAIN, BUT WOULD GO 2 SIZES UP THE NEXT TIME."
5,Alleson Youth Polyester Football Pan t,"This was a gift for my 5-year old grandson. He loves his pants and they arrived in time for Christmas!Marilyn FitzgeraldCarlsbad, CA"
4,Great service,I received the pants in perfect condition but they did not fit my son. With football season starting the next day I had to go to a local store to purchase a different pair. But the service I received from the company was top notch! Very good customer service with quick replies to inquiries. I will use them in the future with no hesitation.
4,who cares about historical truth?,"Most people dont care about what is really true in history, but Prof. Rashid's case is strong, but who would care about his lone voice? It's frightening how the world is indifferent. Some most notable contemporary economists enjoying huge fame, but under careful scrutiny it reveals that the truth about the emporer's cloth. Steve Wang wrote a very revealing book about Paul Samuelson, demantles his myth piece by piece, who has ever read that book?I think Rashid underestimated Smith's role: anything that we do on this world somebody has done it before, i n one form or the other. Economics is about human behavior, therefore some humans knew it well ahead of Smith. His great historical role is not in being original, but his first putting in strong emphasis and clear thinking."
2,Wish I had not bought it,"Just bought the three Mozart/DaPonte operas as played by Harnoncourt and the Concertgeboug! Wish I hadn't. What changes: slow when should be fast, fast when slow, loud when soft, soft when slow. Such a noisy orchestra drowning the singers. Such liberties with the famous arias. What a mess"
3,Unfortunate,"How I wish that conductors should serve the composers and not the other way around. Too bad that the CD era did not coincide with masters like Josef Krips, karl Boehm or even von Karajan. What a sad performance, and that ""continuo"": this is a commedy and that lugubrious cello is completely out of place!"
2,Product switch,"Ordered TWO (2) Wagner 4509 bulbs. Received one (1) Wagner and one (1) Phillips bulb.Phillips bulb came in a previously opened box and the date on the bulb was 10/31/01!!Where has this bulb been for the past 11 years? Has it been used? Has it been dropped? Under what conditions has it been stored? For a lawn tractor maybe, but not taking a chance in an airplane."
2,A dreary affair,"This was a disappointment. Proves that the most interesting characters are often the villains: the only singer who makes a positive impression is Samuel Ramey. The recording is extremely slow and recessed. It sounds more like a run-through than an actual performance and seems to last forever. Jerry Hadley makes nothing of his key moments, and Cecilia Gasdia is only effective in the upper range. Definitely not recommended."
5,Great book,"As in all of this book series, it is very informative and well written. You can't go wrong with the Mountaineer outdoor expert books."
5,comprehensive,"I got this book to prepare for a job at a nordic center as an instructor, rentals assistant, etc. As it turned out, it was the same book my workplace already had and recommended I read. Lots of well presented advice and pictures on classic and nordic form as well as teaching tips. There's also a great introduction to ski types, mechanics, and waxing."
4,CC Skiing refresher,"I haven't been on CC Skis for 40 years, so it was fair to say I needed to brush up a bit. This was a well laid out book and covered all the basics I was looking for. I would recommend it."
3,Are you f$&?ing high ???,I just received my floor Matt's the fronts fit alright except for having to cut hole for the factory retainer I would not recamend buy rears and you have to cut them to fit witch is a wast of money and time all in all I paid 100$ for the pair and had to cut them what an upset
5,"Insightful, Inspiring & Entertaining!","I bought this book for a friend with cancer and after reading the preface and first chapter just couldn't put it down! Verne Varona writes with an amazing clarity, insight and entertaining style while demystifing all kinds of nutritional myths. His information about acid and alkaline is the best I've read anywhere and his sugar craving information has allowed me to challenge what was a formidable addiction. It seems like he's taken the best of numerous cultural medicines and combined them into a practical and refreshing melting pot approach. Best of all, after five weeks on this program I feel better than I have in 30 years! I have as much kitchen savvy as kangeroo, but his recipes are easy-to-follow and absolutely delicious. Whether you have cancer, concerned about cancer or just in search of good health, this highly motivating book is a must read for anyone wanting to improve or recover their health. That's my take!Chet Davenport, Ph.DDenver, Colorado"
5,Excellent book - *everyone* should read it!,"This book has excellent advice for EVERYONE, whether you have cancer or are simply trying to prevent it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK for health & longevity!"
3,Somewhat,"There is some very good information in ""Nature's Cancer-Fighting Foods"" and yet, the writing is redundant and scattered. I find this book a good reference for looking through and finding things I might need to re-read. There are some good explanations and yet, not thorough enough for text or study. If a person does have cancer - it would depend on what stage they were in - there are some very good food tips for anyone who suffers from illness and yet, if a person was in the final stages of cancer it may not be of help. Thank you."
4,Good reference book.,Bought 2 of these..one for my sister and one for myself. I am just beginning to use it as a reference tool and so far I like what I have seen.
4,Real Special,"Definately a great purchase...have only saw it once, but i'm sure i'll be viewing it again!"
3,Not bad......,"The bit works as advertised, it does however seem to dull faster than other bits i've bought. I might buy it if I was just making a few, or in really soft wood."
5,A great durable computer,i am not very easy on my computers. Then i got this computer with the intel celeron m 512mb or ram anda 40gb hard drive it is an awsome machine. it is fast and really durable and i like the keybord better then dells
5,The Best DVD Series To Own - BAR NONE!,"This is the cream of the crop right here. It doesn't get any better than season one of the Sopranos. The writing is incredible. The twists, turns, devotion to family, the family's devotion to a seemingly evil criminal empire. Getting to watch a certified psychopath come home from a long day of strangling ""rats"" to deal with his kid playing too much Nintendo or get a load of crap from his neurotic mother is just priceless. In truth, the rest of the seasons don't really compare to this one. It's just amazing. The rest of the seasons are strong, don't get me wrong, but if you just watch this first season chances are you'll be hooked."
3,Sopranos,"I love the organized crime drama HBO created. I can't wait until the second season is released. The only bad thing about the DVD set is the compression ratio that was used has created a pixelation or noise that appears in the background from time to time. This pixel disturbance is most noticable while Tony is in the phsychiatrist office, just behind his head you can see the compression factor changing the pixel color back and forth."
2,Very Poor Transfer to dvd,"On a regular size tv I guess it looks ok but on a widescreen 64 inch it looks like crap. fuzzy, pixulation, looks like they just tried to get to much on each dvd. It is watchable but doesnt even get close to a quality dvd."
4,VideoQueen,Love this series. I take my Kindle Fire with me to the beauty parlor and it really helps past the time away watching such a great program. The video plays great and I loved getting it at a sale price. I like the fact that purchasing instant videos allows me to watch away and at home and that I actually own the movie and it doesn't take up space in my home by having the instant video.
3,Good things,"Good conditions, great packing, excellent price easy to shop, i recommend to try, shopping was good, its so great i'll continue looking for it."
3,A Start,How do you rate the most original series to grace TV in many years? The HBO format allows for a more honest presentation than any commercially available venue. The one failing of the set is that HBO waited so long to bring it out. More than a year and a half after it debuted and after season 2. The story are characters all develop well beyond the first year. This may be the best testament to the series is that in year 1 the producers were breaking new ground but still tredding softly. I think HBO perpetuates their mistake as year 2 won't be available until year 4 is about to start. The delay in availability hurts the appeal. For the uninitiated these could be a vehicle to become involved and up to date. The release schedule reduces these to collector items.
2,Vastly overrated,"This pathetic mafia soap opera is an artless ripoff of the fan base built by Coppola, Scorsese, and other masters of the genre. A cheap knockoff. A waste of time. I find it very depressing that this rubbish became so popoular...speaks volumes about the vast wasteland of popular culture. The fact that Don Imus tirelessly promoted it should have been a tip-off that it is bad. Imus reminds me of a barkeep I used to know in college who claimed that -- if he wanted to -- he could switch the whole college town to a particularly bad brand of beer. I think Imus had similarly egotistical and perverse motives for hyping this thing."
5,Excellant,"The Sopranos is by far the best programme to have ever been shown on Television. Buying this set will be the best use of money known to man. At first i tried not to buy it, but it pulled me back in."
2,The show is amazing...the videos are terrible.,"I am a big fan of The Sopranos. Tony Soprano is such a beautiful character and I fall more in love with him (James) and the cast every week. I ran out the other day and splurged on the first season collector's set. I took it home, like a boy at Christmas, and unwrapped it. When I popped in the first tape though, there was this ringing...sort of like a modem or telephone. It made the first tape unwatchable. I returned it from where I purchased it, and exchanged it for another set. I took it home and watched all the episodes, somewhat pleased with what I saw. I popped in the 5th and final tape and it was broken. The tape kept cutting in and out and the sound was horrible. I have to take back my set today (FOR THE SECOND TIME). Take my advice, save yourself some trouble and rent it at Blockbuster."
2,"Its no ""Godfather""","The popular Sopranos series can be summed up by saying that if you combined the elements of four other works, The Godfather, Analyze This, Throw Momma From The Train, and the TV series, Thirtysomething, you would get The Sopranos. Its almost like a comic book look at Mafia life. Not nearly as serious or dark as the original Godfather, the main charachter, Tony Soprano struggles through each episode grappling with the stresses of mafia life, avoiding sex with his wife, abusing his girlfriend, and taking out the garbage. The series does have its moments of interest; the soundtrack is hip and appropriate; the camera work is above par; casting is good. But watching the Mafia boss eating a bowl of cereal in his underwear while he swears at his sister is just a little too much white trash than I can handle for a series of this genre."
4,Enjoyable,"I thought I would rent the first season of Sopranos since I don't have HBO and can't watch it. Also, being that I'm from north new jersey, it made it even more enjoyable because I recognized almost all of the spots that they were filmed in. As far as the series go, it's a hit. I was a bit skeptical first because I thought I'd find it hard to get into after watching classic mafia/gangster movies such as Goodfellas, Casino and Scarface. But in the end I found it most enjoyable with some funny parts. James Gandolfini shines as Tony Soprano. He's the reason to watch this series. As far as the other actors go in their roles, it's mostly hit or miss. Meadow Soprano's performance is borderline fair and quite frankly the son (his name slipped my mine for some reason) is extremely annoying. But other than that, the first season was most enjoyable. Now if I can get the second season.."
5,The Sopranos: The Complete First Season,A great DVD series to add to my TV series collections and it arrived on time and in great shape. Would buy from this seller again.
2,no timely communication,I had ordered a DVD which it turned out they didn't have in stock...........I waited the full six weeks without receiving the DVD ........when I emailed them for an explanation I found out why I hadn't received the DVD..........I would have appreciated a more timely explanation.
4,Why it doesn't have subtitles in Spanish!!!,I love this show!! Infortunately... it doesn't have subtitles in Spanish!!! Why is that??? It's terrible to listen to the Spanish Audio....
3,Seriously?,"This season has my favorite episode. You know, the one where Tony gets mad and his wife gets mad and Tony sleeps with his girlfriend and Tony has to have someone killed but its just business and Tony complains to his therapist that he's just misunderstood and why don't people understand and appreciate how misunderstood and underappreciated he is. But fuggetaboutit. So the scripts repeat themselves on a nearly regular basis. Everybody loves a tough guy. And Tony is that guy. And that's what the show is all about."
1,Bad people!!,"The people on this show are so mean to each other. They holler and cuss all the time, and even worse, sometimes they kill each other. If it's supposed to be a family show why can't they be nice.It is shows like this with all the violence, bad language, and cruelty to mankind that is helping make this nation go downhill."
1,Bigotry at its worst!,"The Italians involved in making this junk have sold their heritage for 30 pieces of silver. Anyone who enjoys this promotion of vice and filth needs help. If this was done about some other ethnic group like blacks, hispanics, irish, there would be such an outcry of bigotry that HBO would stop production."
5,You gotta git it!,"Lemme keep this short....these tapes did wonders in keeping my roommates and I from studying for finals. It's so good that when you get done with one episode, you've gotta watch another. A definate good buy if you're looking to kill about fourteen hours or so."
4,Some of the Best TV has t offer,"I do not have HBO, but I make it a point to ""appear"" at my parents house and it just ""happens"" to be on!Not for Children under 13, this adult drama is realistic, identifiable if your from NY/Northeast, and has some of the best acting ever for TV. The ""Mother Patriarch"" is at times hilarious, and I watch my own mother cringe since she says ""she reminds me of SO MANY in my family!"".On the DVD side, having 14 episodes, in their entirety, no commercials, DVD sound and vision quality, in an attractive fold out case, Emmy winning, the best show in its class...on and on.. and you can watch the whole first season progress with no interruption, or missing part or two.If you can afford it, like superlative drama, and like ""dark"" comedy, go for this. Its a MUST have. '**'"
5,An Aria of Excellence,"I admit it -- I don't have HBO. That being said, I purchased The First Season and watched the entire package over the Labor Day weekend. Gandolfini is magnificent, everyman, threatening, sensitive, boorish, charming. His character is fascinating -- you'd like to meet him on a plane, learn about his life, and hopefully never see him again. The rest of the family, including Livia (played by the late Nancy Marchand) and his ""other family"" are equally complex. My only fault is that the last episode left me wanting to purchase the next set of videos so that I could keep up with the story line. ARRRRRGH -- November is when the next season comes out?"
5,woke up this morning...,"I am a diehard Sopranos fan. I still have that Journey song bouncing through my head from the very last episode. So what is a 'made fan' supposed to do now that the only series I watched is now over? Start watching from the very beginning. I've been a fan since season 1 but how refreshing it is to watch it all again. It is amazing to see how young everyone is back from season 1. The intro to the characters and all the little nuances that you pick up is amazing. The storyline of Tony in his first session with Melfi, how conniving his mother was, Uncle Jun and his old school ways. Most amazing to me how virile and full of hope Tony seems to be and how much he changed over the years beaten down by the life he leads. Incredible writing and incredible acting. A dvd for the ages. Bada Bing!"
1,another cheap copy,Of the past 5 DVD's I have purchased thru Amazon Two are cheap copy's. Odds not good .From now on I will buy local.
2,Had High Hopes For This Series...So Disappointed. I'm Out.,"Note: I just saw this with XFinity On Demand.I'd read about this series and heard about how popular it was on HBO, and that it was a modern-day ""Godfather."" today, I decided to watch the pilot episode to see if I liked it, and i was so disappointed. The story is not very good, jumping back and forth between Tony's relationship with his mother, wife and daughter and his visit to a shrink. I had no problem at all with the nudity; too little of that. Personally, I prefer The Godfather to this crap and that steaming pile of cow dung known as Scarface with Pacino (the 1932 movie is better). I also like historical drama series' like The Borgias. Great storylines, meticulously researched for accuracy and wwell-built sets (unlike the obvious CGI ""Sets"" of Spartacus: Blood And Sand). Avoid this series and Scarface with Pacino. Trashy."
2,The show is great...the videos aren't,"I am a big fan of The Sopranos. Tony Soprano is such a beautiful character and I fall more in love with him (James) and the cast every week. I ran out the other day and splurged on the first season collector's set. I took it home, like a boy at Christmas, and unwrapped it.

Take my advice, save yourself some trouble and rent it at Blockbuster."
1,THE SOPRANOS 1ST SEASON DVD SET,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FROM BILL'S GREAT BOOKS. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM! I TRIED TO CONTACT THEM AND RECEIVED NO RESPONSE! THANKFULLY AMAZON REIMBURSED ME!
1,The Sopranos 1st season,I received this item as a Christmas gift and when opened sealed package the 4th disc was missing
5,One of the best,"Unlike most, I don't have HBO and I'v never watched the Sopranos on TV before. However, I'd heard so many good things about the show, that was the first DVD I bought when I received a new DVD player for Christmas. The VHS version is good, but the quality isn't that great and it's too hard to navigate through the episodes. On the DVD, you can use the features to find a specific episode, then get plot summaries and another feature that allows you to scroll through certain scenes within a specific episode. The VHS version requires you to rewind and fast-forward the cassette to find the right episode and it's too much trouble. For nearly the same price, the DVD is worth the money and the show is one of the best on television. Worth buying if you have a DVD player, and worth buying a DVD player FOR if you don't."
2,Couldn't have cared less,"Many viewers clearly loved the characterizations and found the mixture of mundane family life with mafia family life to be brilliant, but I disliked this show because I found the characters pathetic and dull. Most of what I remember is a bunch of glowering punctuated by a few arguments and gunshots.The bulk of characters seem to represent a very mediocre brand of evil. They are human failures not because they gleefully engage in villainy, but simply because they are incompetent at living their lives. The acting, sound, and camera work were all quite competent, but since I was bored by the story, it was all wasted effort as far as I'm concerned.Certainly I'm aware of how popular the show is; the only other negative reviews seem to consist of people who can't deal with language or feel unfairly stereotyped. I figured I should take the time to say some people simply didn't think this was a very good drama."
2,movie,Just not my cup of tea. I didn't like it. Story line was confussing to me so I had trouble following the story line. I will not buy any more of the series
4,Season one of the Sopranos,"One of the all time great series in the history of TV, for those of us who didn't have HBO when the series was on, DVD's are a second chance to see Tony in action ""Bada Bing""The Extras & Commentary give an insight into the Directors mind.my only downside to this excelent series was the ending.............. fade to blackThe delivery was fast, DVD is in great shape."
3,looking forward to this for a christmas gift,haven't received yet but watched all the shows and looking forward to the classic. My son in law is a great fan
5,Waiting for the second season to come out on DVD!!!!,Just as my title states. I cannot wait for the second season to come out on DVD. Of course then I will buy it and spend another Saturday watching the whole thing!!! It is that good!!!
3,OK PURCHASE,"I recieved my disc's within a week, so the shipping was fast. All the disc's except disc 3 were like new. Disc 3 had a couple scratch scuffs on them that I can not remove. I would rate this as a very good, not as a like new under purchase info."
2,Maybe It's Just me..,".I watched the first episode at a friends house and I couldn't stand this series, maybe it is just me but I couldn't get passed the language, I realize that language is only part of it and I agree there is a strong story line here but does the F word have to be every second word?? Sorry, but that to me is distracting and not very original."
1,Garbage,"For people who like TV series with lots of violence, sex, corruption and excessive use of bad language, the Sopranos DVD's are tops.My purchase, after viewing only 2 discs has gone where it belongs....... the garbage bin."
1,Overrated,"Am I alone in thinking that this series is completly overrated? I get the feeling that a lot people simply can't face up to the fact that they hate this show. The characters and story lines are cliched and predictable, and Gandolfini is actually a poor actor.Anyone who dislikes this show but then publicly proclaims their love for is abusing the freedoms that our forefathers lost their lives to defend. You are un-patriotic and not a true American."
5,Great Deal; Great Product,"I was curious as to where i could find season 1 of the Sopranos and for a decent price. I certainly wanted to pay less than the cost to rent each episode, and didn't feel it worth it to pay $40 or $50 for something i just wanted to catch up on. I found a clean copy at a really good price, that worked perfect!"
4,"Best Series on TV today, but...","I can't get enough of the Sopranos. That's why I bought the collection of DVDs for seasons I and II. It is without a doubt in my mind, the best series on television today. If you don't have HBO and you haven't had a chance to see the show, I highly recommend getting the DVD sets.HOWEVER... as a DVD, I was a little disappointed in the special features. There IS a one hour interview with David Chase (the creator of the show), and he also does an audio commentary for one of the episodes, but I guess I was hoping for a little more.I would have really liked to have seen some features on the actors. Maybe audio commentary from them on some other episodes.All in all the show is incredible, but maybe down the road the DVD will have better special features. I for one couldn't wait, though."
5,Fabulous if you enjoy Mafia entertainment,"The acting is fantastic, the stories gripping. Like a good book, you just can't get enough. My only word of caution is there is strong verbage and some graphic violence. Everything you'd expect in a good mafia story and then some. My advice is get it, watch it, and then patiently await the release of the 2nd season as I am."
5,This is not television but rather...,"...an eleven hour movie broken into one hour segments. The acting is superb, direction is excellent, and the choices of music is very clever. Pay attention to the almost subliminal background music, easy to miss. The Sopranos has become a social phenomenon so I won't push how great it is, so just look at the credits at the end. Note that ""Tony"" has a dialect coach!"
5,my favorite solo piano album,"I first heard a small clip of this CD on NPR when they played music in-between news stories. I have many solo piano CDs and this one is the best I have at transporting me to a different place, a place I would rather be after a hard day, it's like something out of a dream. Many artist have wonderful melodies but this one has emotion, not strong but subtle and soothing. The other reviews talk about how relaxing it is, and it is, but not by boring you, but by taking you on a wonderful journey. Each cut is different, but it all has a theme. I have given this CD away many times, I think this is by far Elisabeth's best one."
2,Maxim's tone is too dry,"Actually I am not quite keen on Maxim's interpretation. The tone is too dry. I prefer Gil Shahm, and Joshua Bell's interpretation. Among Maxim's Russian compatriot, I like Vladimir Spivakov's interpretation. I wonder why Spivakov did not record as much."
1,Disappointing,"This is a very poorly made, cheap-looking ring. When it arrived, I contacted the company because of its poor quality (it had a dent on the main band; one of the feet was ""smeared"" onto the edge of the ring; the black finish was bare in a spot; and at the join was a foot that looked more like a paw). Their customer service is great and they sent me a replacement along with a return label for the first. Unfortunately the second ring was as bad, if not worse, than the first."
5,Plot Synopsis,"Emmy Lane, a child of itinerant workers, decides to go on a Friends Service Project to a very poor Indian village in Mexico. Although she herself has come from a hard life, she is unprepared for what she finds."
5,Leadership Results Coaching,David Rock presents a six-step approach to coaching for results. His methodology is sound. He offers clear sets of coaching questions at each stage of a process that uses leadership coaching to transform results. The tools in this book facilitate learning and practicing leadership skills that take performance at work from good to great.
4,The Leading Edge of Leadership,"Quiet Leadership is the best book I have read for tying the most recent advances in neuroscience to leadership behaviors, particularly coaching. Having worked with leadership and coaching for a long time, and just recently starting working with neuroscience, I am personally thrilled to see all of these tied together. I strongly believe that the use of neuroscience in all aspects of business will grow rapidly, so this is a very timely contribution. It is worth reading just for the first sections.However, the coaching methodology of the Six Steps is too complex for me -- too many steps and substeps. These sections still have some value, particularly the ties to neuroscience, but I would recommend skimming those sections."
4,Big improvement over the airline tray table,"The inflatable travelon pillow was a life saver on a very long transAtlantic flight over Christmas. While it did nothing to create leg room in tourist class, it allowed me to sleep much more comfortably than I otherwise would have. It is not equivalent to flying business class, but goes a good way toward minimizing the pain associated with uncomfortable neck positions caused by lousy airline seat placement. I would recommend buying it for you next long flight.Travelon Cabin Comfort Inflatable Pillow, Grey, One SizeTravelon Cabin Comfort Inflatable Pillow"
4,good for long trips,"This worked fairly well for an overnight trip to Europe. This actually worked better when there was less leg room. When there was too much space between the seat in front and my seat, it did not stay in place (however I then put it on the floor and used it to elevate my legs)."
3,Pillow,"This pillow is somewhat cumbersome to blow up, but it defates quickly. If blown up less than max it is comfortable."
1,Not for the economy class traveller,"First, this item is huge before it is inflated and there is really no way to efficiently store it. It takes up way too much space in your carry on luggage. If it was incredibly comfortable or useful, it might be worth it it, but it isn't. I never used it on my 16 hour flight as once it was inflated, I really had to stay in that position because if the seats next to you are full, there is no place to easily place it if you want quickly grab the earphones you dropped or something like that. Also, it kind of makes the person next to you claustrophobic when in use because it completely boxes them in as well. It is really just too cumbersome for economy class travel between fitting it in your luggage, inflating it and using it. I wish I wouldn't have bought it as I will never use it again. I don't think it is the brand but just the item itself."
1,"Good idea, but nope.","I think this would work fine for a short person. I had to hunch over too far to be comfortable, even with a bulky jacket stacked underneath. Forgot to return it, so shorter folks...drop me a line!"
3,comfortable but unweildly,"The pillow is a good idea and it works if you can work it. The problem is not the pillow but the seats in the airplane. I was so crowded on last flight that I couldn't even get the pillow out of my bag, and it's so big there was no room to blow it up. When it is inflated there's hardly room for both of us ( me & the pillow) in the seat.I wish there was a solution to this problem because this is a good idea but even uninflated the thing is hard to manage. Also it is expensive, but this is the only one of its type. I wish the mfr had some competition and could come up with a design that's easier to handle in a crowded seat."
2,Almost!,"This was a good idea...but way too big when deflated and inflated. A smaller, lighter version would be the one! We bought 2, traveled to Europe and had to abandoned them on our first stop..they are somewhere in Paris. I hate to waste $ but I know we wouldn't have used them again."
1,Bad Design,"As many others say, cuts off blood supply in legs. Wife actually uses it as a tall for rest on the plane. The other problem is that it isn't easy to hold, while there is a arm loop to hold, when you lean in to the shape, it doesn't want to stay in place, just roll forward."
2,disappointing,"This is the second Dumpy book I've gotten to read to my 5 year old, and the second one in which I've been disappointed. The plot is choppy. One second the rich lady is appealing to the paper to write an article about the collection, the next they're driving to the United Nations? And what's with the African Children's Choir that is almost entirely white?The general idea of charity and things working out for the best is commendable, but I felt the execution left much to be desired."
4,terrific first cd,"this cd is a terrific first blues recording with a unique mix of colorado and mississippi. i am looking forward to buying the next effort from otis. i would describe it as fat possum meets popular alligator stuff, both of which have their place in our collections."
1,"Values, Yes; Stalinism, No!","Who in the world doesn't want kids in school to learn the basics of moral deliberation and elements of solid character?? But even on the face of it, to label the values of other people of good will in society, when they want them taught, as merely ""Stalinist"" is hardly indicative of a person who might be a reasonable guide to the whole matter. That is what Kevin Ryan has done, and it should raise questions at the very least about his own goodwill if not more."
3,Does not work properly with wide screen Sony camcoder,I bought these filters to work with a Sony wide-screen camcorder. Even though these filters mounted fine the aperture was apparent lt too small. In the wide-angle mode the four corners are black an the images looked like looking though a tube.
3,"3.5 STARS For Good Old Scool Kung Fu, But bad Editing!","This is an old school Kung Fu Collecters but unfortunetly no effort has been put into making this old school flick look better.I have not seen Ground Zero Entertainment's version but AVOID! Lion Video's version it is so bad I only paid $7.99 for it and i still returned it because the screen would jump,picture brake up,bad Editing ,and it looked like it was copied from a copied VHS. The sound sucks,no widescreen, and only in English dubbed. I can make a better DVD without trying just give me the tools . I'd rather pay $20 for a good version than Lion's version for FREE! We didn't buy a DVD to watch VHS quallity movies, DVD distributers hear me out! Anyway enjoy Shaolin vs Ninja and try to focous on the Kung Fu so you can forget how bad the quality is."
2,"Horrid English dubs, poor quality...","I collect martial arts films on DVD. This one is a bomb and a half. The dubbed voices don't even match the actors and they're so bad you can't stay interested in the movie. The movie cuts out to blackness quite a few times, which is really annoying. The picture fades from color overkill to hardly any at all. I bought the Lion Video version. I have other Lion DVD's that are great, but this one shouldn't have been put out like it is."
4,This is the Ultimate Cheesy Kung-Fu Movie in existance!,"If you love kung-fu movies that are so cheesy, so bad, so hilariously rediculous, then this is the one for you! When this movie was transfered from widescreen format to box format, the original subtitles were slightly cut off. As a result, when the movie had to be dubbed in English, no one knew what the heck they were supposed to be saying. So, the actors who over-dubbed it made it up as they went along. This movie will have you rolling on the floor with laughter with such lines as, ""Why you shukin' an' jivin me?"" and ""My Wife Test Drove one of those american cars...IT'S AIRBAG EXPLODED! And that's why, Mr. Mitsubishi, I want to kill you for your business...""Anyways, it kicked a**!"
5,Yes,"Yes, dis is a great one. To all the haters: pop' em up!5 Points for the beat, the lyrics, the realness, the originality plus the in ya face mentality... all you can do is buy it and bump it too the limitHibe"
4,"The anime is really good, but seriously guys..","Trying to tell a lite box set Ah My Goddess for over 100 dollars used? Are you insane? That is pretty stupid, especially when I've seen it at Fry's for 30 before. The lite set is NOT THAT RARE, and you are totally gouging for a used set"
2,"""Meh!""","Not a bad product, but didn't last as long as I would have liked. I am rough with my phone and needed something to help. This worked well for about two(2) months before it started to crack and break off in little pieces. I thought the softer (rubberized) plastic would fair better, but for the price, I can't complain too much!"
2,already broke!,"I have had the cover about a week and it has already broken. The top cover looks shattered on one side where it grasps onto the phone. Yes I have dropped the phone - which is why I bought the proctective cover in the first place. I was very happy when it arrived. It looks very nice. Is not clunky like the other cases I have tried prior to this one, but at least the those never broke; especially in less than 10 days of use!!"
5,Verrrrry Cool,An awesome little product. I removed the piece that allows it to attach to the clip(it was only held by a screw). Now it feels like I have a batphone that can easily fit in any pocket. Two thumbs UP.
3,Razr Protection,"The V3 cover fits easily and is soft to the touch. The black cover has a matte finish that is easy on the eyes. However, it does show scratches and it unforgiving in that regard. My biggest issue is with the belt clip. While the clip is easy enough to open/attach, it is too bulky. So bulky that I don't use it. In addition, the mount is not a universal one so clips from other Razr covers cannot be used. So, if use of the belt clip is important, one would be advised to think twice about this product."
2,"almost good, but not quite","I was initially impressed with the sturdy cover, but then the swivel belt clip broke in half. I guess it is almost tough enough.Looked good before it broke, almost went 3 weeks!"
1,Picture didn't Match Recieved Product,"First: The part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to be attached to the case with 4 screws. Second: No Fixed belt clip. Third: Only the case is black, all other parts are clear plastic. Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each, spent 35 dollars on shipping. Guess i got what i paid for. Now i have to go thru the process of trying to get a full refund."
2,Not like I imagined...,"I received my case without the fixed belt clip, and that was the reason why I ordered it. The rubberized material is chipping off, and the material under that is really glossy. Oh well for the five dollars and some change that I spent overall on this product."
1,Worthless,"Don't bother with this product. Though it's designed to fit the Razr like a glove and will initially look nice when snapped on, you'll probably get no more than a couple of weeks worth out of it. I had mine for ten days, and already the front panel has broken from normal wear."
2,YAy!! *pause* oh.,"When I first got this item I was very pleased. It was so cheap and it looked great. It snaps so easily on and feels really cool. However, after about 3 weeks, the duller, not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off. Beneath it was a very shiny black coat. I was so disappointed, I took it off and went with my original cover. It looks really bad and just looks like something I've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks. I am very displeased with this item."
1,read the fine print,"belt clip is optional, read the fine print.I ended up buying a leather case of which was exactly what I thought it would be"
1,Black case cover for Razr phone.,"The cover for the phone is fine but the belt clip and screw provide has no place to be mounted, I have to dril hole in casing also screw come with out any locking tread. I would not recomended this to any one and never buy this item again."
2,dissatisfied,Product was what I wanted just did not hold up. Phone fell off as the clip came undone. Reassembled the clip using loctite. Then it broke after a couple weeks. Not thre ideal product.
2,case cover,not bad product for its price. rubber finish started wearing w/ in 2 weeks and racket that attaches to clip broke then also. for its price you pay for what you get.
3,razr v3 case,The cover fits my phone very well and is easy to use. I don't like how thesoft part of the cover wears off. It was coming off after only two days.
2,OK...Not Earth Shattering,"I got this book based on Dan Kennedy's (author of the ""No BS"" series of marketing books)recommendation that Stuart Wilde was a great author with great ideas.It's a decent book with a lot of the metaphysical concepts in most books of this type: expect what you want, visualize, feel the result and so on. The first few Chapters were well written but then he gets into his cutesy, colloquial style which I found a little grating.If you've never read any ""Law of Attraction"" type books, this is a good one to begin your journey. It's small and a quick read."
5,Great book!!,The information in this book will help you understand money better and to help you get over your money issues!!!
5,Great CD,This book was so good i decided to get the CD! Its not only about money. Its a book about life and how to treat others. Sometimes you can get caught up in lifes day to day challenges and others negative energy. With this audio it keeps me reminded and focused on the good i should give to people and this planet. AND make money at the same time!!!!!!! Kudos to Stuart Wilde!
1,Mark CD by John Shea,Only about the first have of the CD plays ... the rest of it skips and/or doesn't play at all. What should I do with it? I bought Shea's other other CDs...but have yet to open them.
4,what the hell?,"Why cant I find this album anywhere? I listened to a few of his songs a few years back and liked it, but now I cant find it anywhere and his website is just black."
5,Microsoft Graphics Studio: Picture It! 99,It is like the MS Picture It I had before but has more features. Love it!
4,another knut buster......,"this title though not as notorious as 5dv and kwga is just as tasy.....the pacing of this film is even faster(action-wise)than just about any sb film i've seen.it's a NORTH vs. SOUTH, E vs.W story but with a ninja crew tied in to one side.the many fight scenes is based all on honor and revenge for one's school.that's enough reasoning for me if the bottom line is incredible fight scenes with creative weaponry that seems to be the trademark of the sb movies of this time.let me note that not all of the movies starring the 5 deadlies were great but this one is definitely one for the ages....i'd give it 5 stars if the quality could compare with today's movies but the quality was very satisfactory.this copy is almost fullscreen proportion-wise which made it more enjoyable.sound also decent.with movies like this and kwga all you need is a late friday night with the fellas and if your girl can't get into this that's just too bad and she's lucky i didn't pick up the warriors yet...."
2,"Great movie, horrible censored print","UGH! This is one of the best kung-fu movies ever made, but was completely butchered on this release. First off, the quality is terrible. There are dust and scratches present as well as analog hits. Looks like the DVD was ripped straight from a bad VHS copy. But the worst thing is this movie is heavily censored. Upon a quick screening I noticed at least 2 flowing blood scenes chopped out, 1 word of profanity missing, and 1 scene of nudity wiped out. I'm sure even more has been cut. Please, someone release this movie the way it was meant to be seen!!!"
2,Daddy Dearest?,"A much less then enjoyable collection of stories. The type of material one expects from a student of the many writing programs around the continent. All of the stories feel incomplete and grounded in the idea of writing about something, but not having really experienced anything in a real life. It isn't that the author doesn't have the ability to construct a story, it's just that she doesn't have anything really meaniful to say. Most of the collection reminded me of the early Ann Beattie. I feel bad, I feel sad, or isn't life a bummer. The passivity of most of the women in this collection was also a real turn-off, in each story their helplessness sounds like a repeat of the past one. And this collection has the strangest group of Daddies around-cold, indifferent, almost always vague. It's interesting that three of the stories were winners of competitions when originally published. It just goes to show that a decent story in isolation does not a great collection make."
2,Not a Father's Day gift,"The author is a good fiction writer. But the cover is misleading. It's a collection of stories about insecure young women discovering relationships with men, with parents, with the world. Not a young woman's relationship with her father, as I was expecting from the cover. Too bad. Also, it is written for a teenage or twenty-something female audience."
4,Excellent review recently on NPR weekend edition; I agree!,Poignant semi-autobiographical account of life with Dad
2,misleading title--,"From the title I thought this would be a book about the tender relationship between fathers and daughters. Instead, it's a collection of stories that have little to do with father-daughter relationships. A father is present in many of the stories, that's about it. There is little tenderness. The farther you get from the front of the book the farther you get from any sort of tenderness. It's a fast read (i read it in a day). Based on the title I was hoping it could be a book I could give to my father on my wedding day (next year). After reading it, I wouldn't even give it to a friend on her birthday."
3,My c340,"I received this camera for my 21st birthday in 2005. The camera is amazing when it comes to picture quality for a camera with only 3x zoom. I like the ease of the settings and controls on this camera. The camera is also durable, I have dropped it a few times and it seems to be holding up rather well. However, the camera does turn on very easily by only bumping the knob on top of the camera. Also, the battery life is absolutely horrible. I can only take maybe 20 pictures before I see the indication that my battery is going to die. It is a burden to have to purchase batteries all the time. I have tried the rechargeable batteries but they don't seem to improve it any. Lately I have also been noticing a decrease in picture clarity. It may be of the batteries dying all the time, but at this point, I can't really tell what the problem is."
1,There are much better choises out there,I've had to beg this thing to work for me since the day I bought it. It would be redundant to list all the reasons why this was a poor choice just read the other reviews. It's been so frustruating - it'd almost be better to have no camera at all. There are so many other really good cameras out there - skip this one!!!!
5,Love it,I love this camera. I takes great pictures and is very easy to use. At first i thought that the picture quality was going to be bad because when it shows up on the cameras screen the quality doesnt look very good but when you upload them onto the computer the quality is great. So far i havent had a problem with the batteries. (...). We used the same kind in our old digital camera and the old one would quickly use up all the charge but not my new Kodak.
3,"User friendly, but is it reliable?","I like the c340 for it's user friendliness. It has a slight problem with the control knob rotating too easy which results in the turning on in the case or when taking in or out.The real problem is that camera died 1/2 year after the purchase (used just slightly ~100 shots). Though it wasn't that easy to find the phone number, Kodak service line was quite friendly so far. Camera was mailed for service. I will update!Update: Kodak's warranty turn-around was great! Camera was repaired and DHLed to me in 4 days. All took less than 10 days.They have a nice service-tracking site too."
2,Do Waste your Money,Never worked and I am very disappointed in it as Kodak has always been such a great manufacturer for photo stuff
4,digital camera for beginners,"Purchased this camera for a grandchild (12 yrs old) and its perfect for him. It makes great pictures and is easy to use . However, video quality is standard and ,didnt come with a charger.. but, I would recommend this for a beginner its perfect and price is reasonable..."
3,"Simple to use, but big","This camera is really simple to use and takes great quality pictures (considering the low price).Compared to other digitals though, it is rather bulky.I HATE the Kodak easyshare software. It is huge and always is always popping up and trying to force extra features on me. And it is sooooo slow. I just bypassed all that and simply drag and drop the photos from my computer to the Cdrive. Simple.It's a good buy for casual photographers who happen to carry large bags."
2,Ehh.,"Loved this camera the first month or so that I owned it. Two years later my feelings are very different. Batteries need to be recharged constantly. Camera rarely turns on after being off it's dock for more than an hour. All I can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying. Zoom is worthless, pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated. Flash is also way too bright, half of my pictures are annoyingly ""white"" looking because of this. Definitely going with Canon on my next purchase."
2,Love affair is over...,I am sooo disappointed. I loved this camera and the docking station when I first got it and actually up until recently. This camera did well for me for about two years with intermittant use. I cannott take pics with it anymore however. Unfortunately I discovered that it quit working on my daughter's fourth birthday. The pictures ALL come out dark no matter what I do. The batteries do not last more than a day or two. This goes for regular AA's and rechargeable. I could go on and on. I hope the newer models of this camera are better and last longer. I am going with an entirely different camera altogether.
1,Stay Away-eats batteries-occasionally works-no customer service,"This camera has been a waste of time and a major disappointment.Always seems to die when you need it most..have tried all types of batteries fresh out of the package and nothing works.It will blink green and then go red immediately.Latest issue... LCD screen turns purple and picture bleeds to the bottom of screen.Customer service wants me to pay to send to Texas(from Virginia) for them to look at it and pay all postage,insurance etc. They also offered me a 15% discount on a new Kodak(really?)Camera is 19 months old.In the trash it goes!!!"
2,Worthless except in bright light,"The camera takes decent pictures in bright light, but it's useless in any sort of dim light. The flash is weak (probably because it has to run on AAs), so only close subjects are well-lit; and there's no autofocus lamp, so it can't focus unless you've got bright light. I returned it and got a Canon SD500 instead."
1,Great buy!,I purchased this for my daughter since I had already had purchased one for myself. The pictures are clear and crisp. If I had to buy another I would purchase the same.
1,Flash too bright,"I strongly dislike this camera. The flash is sooo bright that all of the pictures of my child come out making her look drunk, with her eyes halfway open. I have tried every setting and nothing works. I emailed Kodak customer service and they said the brightness of the flash is an inherent property of the camera and there's nothing they are willing to do to help me. Great company, huh? This is the WORST camera I have ever owned. I am going back to using my old, cheap, HP digital camera. Even though it's only 2 or 3 mp at least I'll get normal pictures."
4,Easy to use .. good pics,The camera is good for someone looking for a point and shoot digicam. The movie mode is the same compared to other kodak digicams. But comparing it to the Kodak z740 and other higher models the build quality is poor and the plastic looks cheap. I own a z740 also and the results are quite similar. Its a good buy for $170.
1,No back up service,I purchased my Koday digital camera and it was fine - until it stopped working while I was at a quilt show. The lens stuck in the on position and nothing I tried would retract the lens. After a few minutes it turned off and now it can't be turned back on. I had pictures in the memory and there was no way to retrieve them.I called customer service and all they were interested in was selling me another camera at around half the original price. They also wanted me to pay shipping to and from their office at around [...] each way.Buy the camera if you feel adventurous but beware that you probably will not be able to get service when you need it most.Also forget about buying the docking port - it is very expensive to print from it... both the paper and the ink cartridges. It's way cheaper to use your color printer and buy photo paper.
2,Disappointment,"This camera is fine for simple outdoor photography, but anything overcast, in motion or requiring any variation of focus will yield a disappointing outcome. This camera is all but useless indoors--I certainly regret having taken it with me to Europe this summer, it was not worth its weight in luggage."
3,Kodak EasyShare C340 5MP Digital Camera,"The camera is nice and the features are quite user friendly, but the camera chews through batteries like there's no tomorrow. I'd recommend perhaps a Canon or a Sony."
4,just short of spectacular,"Based on the cover of this novel (some undefinable creature holding a stone covered in runes) I was expecting a cheap thrill of some rampaging creature ripping the heads off people or something along that lines. What I got instead was a rather smart thriller that was more Alistair MacLean than Stephen King. In fact, this was like a MacLean espionage thriller with quite a bit of Dean Koontz-like horror elements grafted onto it, as a research team attempts to uncover the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster, with various individuals attempting to sabotage the expedition. A mysterious stone covered in runes also features into the story. Though the writing is not quite polished enough to make it a must-read, and the novel is perhaps a bit too ambitious for its own good, those looking for something different and challenging should seek this out."

3,Kinda Long!,"Shirts seem to be of good quality. The only complain is that they are very long like a dress! It's great if you tuck them into your baseball pants, but to wear with shorts or casually, way too long"
1,poor quality,I usually buy Hanes or Gildan. This shirt is too thin and cheap-feeling. The dye ran and the shirt faded immediately. I won't buy this product again.
4,A GOOD BUY FOR A T SHIRT,"THIS WAS A GREAT BUY AND A GREAT FIT, I'AM TALL SO IT WAS TRICKY GETTING THE RIGHT LENGHT, BUT IT FITS JUST FINE, COULD I HAVE A FREE ONE FOR THIS SURVEY? 3X BLACK, BLUE, CHARCOAL ARE MY FAVORITES."
3,Good shirt for the price.,This is a nice shirt for the price. I coach a youth baseball team and bought this shirt to wear when games get a little chilly. It runs a little long (shirt comes down to mid-thigh). Shirt is kind of a tight fit so it may be good as an under garment.
5,Softest baseball shirt ever!!!!,"Bought these in navy and red and I'm in love! Sizing is spot on, colors are great, and they are delightfully comfy and soft. Idk how they hold up in the wash yet, but so far I'm impressed :)"
3,"Early Venoms Action, with a few bumps","I've watched all of the better Shaw Bros kung fu films, and have always been a fan of the Venoms. The fighting in this DVD is well staged, especailly the ending fight where the 2 heroes takes on 5 spear fighters.The DVD image quality is a little poor in the beginning of the film, showing lots of grain but fear not, the image gets better as the film progresses. A major plus is that this DVD is presented in letterboxed widescreen, which is hard to find in many of the old school kung fu flicks.The MAJOR problem with this DVD is the fact that many portions of the fights have been edited, to cut out the violence and gore. Key strikes, like when an opponent is killed are cut, confusing you on how certain battles are won. Its chopped up so badly in some places that the action makes no sense, even if you go through the fight in slow motion. Too bad..."
3,Mediocre Print of A Great Movie,"A Five Venoms classic from Chang Cheh, and a personal favourite of star Lo Mang. Great fights, some character development, even a couple of female characters-- unusual in Chang's normally all-male world.This is a film I've watched, taped and purchased often in the last fifteen years-- and I'm sorry to say that the print chosen for this DVD is not a good one. There are sound quality problems, blackouts and repetitions in the sound, clumsy editing (it appears to have been assembled from two or more prints edited for television...). It is definitely not the best print of this film, but as it IS the DVD print, it's likely to become the definitive version, to the chagrin of purists who have seen it uncensored and whole."
3,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","There is no question this is a 4 star performace,,,however, this is my synopsis on this flick: Definately another tough performance from the venom crew,,and I can't seemed to get enough of them. However, it's starting to feel like if you've seen one it's like you've seen them all. I have watched almost all the venom flicks, approximately 11 thus far,,and they now seemed like the same old thing to me,,which apparently is getting profoundly boaring aswell. For example in all the plots, usually the same guys are friends, and every-time the same one dude (Lo Meng, The Toad) ends up getting killed ,,,,with the exception, Return of The 5 Deadly Venom AKA Crippled Avengers. Respectively,,,I also though the DVD transfer on this one was is kinda poor,,even the audio I find to be poorly transitioned!!"
2,"Killer Army, edited action","Let me say first, I am a huge fan of the Venoms movies, in the mid to late eighties Monday night was Kung Fu night on tv and the Venoms were the stars. I used to get a little frustrated with how they edited out some of the violence, but understood that movies are sometimes edited for television. Which brings me to Killer Army on DVD, I felt I was a young kid again watching the edited version, except all the death scenes are completely edited, if I had never seen this movie before I would be confused as to what is happening. All the fight scenes are chopped up even worse than when I watched as a teenager. All the blood and death scenes are pretty much gone. I have ordered quite a few of the Venoms flicks and I know not to always expect the best picture quality, but this is the first one I have recieved that is edited so bad. I really enjoyed the story and the parts of fight scenes you do see are great, but a die hard fan will be disappointed with the butchery of the film."

5,Utterly superlative,"I rarely review books, however.... Mere words fail to describe the sheer genius that are the Mr. Hughart's efforts on Master Li and Number Ten Ox. The three books in this omnibus are so cleverly written, so unfailingly humorous and so totally poignant that other works will hereafter be spoiled for me. The author does state that he could have written more adventures for these characters after these three, but that they would have been formulaic, and what would be the point in that? As accurate as that may be, I mourn the fact that the world has no more to look forward to from this amazing author and his two phenomenal characters. Should he write anything else, I will snap it up. I also know that I will re-read these books in the future and approach that task with absolute glee, that I am given the chance to do so."
5,Great book!,"It's a classic, definitely did not get as much attention as it deserved!!! Couldn't recommend it more. Pick it up."
5,A wonderfully funny book,"This has got to be one of my all time favorite books, combining a sort of ""folk""tale story with humorous and imaginative characters. The stories are a sort of pseudo-Chinese epic tale of two adventurers and the events and characters they encounter."
1,Official Patient's Sourcebook on Arachnoid Cysts,"This book is absolutely useless. The only time the arachnoic cyst is actually mentioned in the book is when the description of one is given. Other than that, it is obvious that it doesn't matter if you get the book on Hypothyroidism or Arachnoid Cysts, the writers just used ""search and replace"" to change the words out. The book is full of websites that you get for free by doing a Google search on Arachnoid Cysts, and information on nutrition, how to be a good patient (ask questions) and why you should watch out what medicines you take as some may be contraindicated (it doesn't say which ONES mind you, it's a blanket statement.)This book is such a complete rip off.Don't buy it."
1,This Book Sucks,I put together arachnoidcyst.org and I promise that you will find my website much more informative than this B.S. with a support group from Yahoo! where we all support one another. You won't find a lot of the information from the website in the book because the book it outdated and honestly doesn't give you any information or tell you what the long term studies are doing. If you would like please submit your story to me via the site so other people can read about your flavor in dealing with the worst nightmare Steven King couldn't pen. Sorry you have to know what this disease is. Please write to me at info@arachnoidcyst.org
2,Book review,"this is just as described. a source book for the internet. i was looking for more detailed information about what may cause arachnoids cysts, symptoms, but this is just a reference book. not worth the money i paid for it."
3,WHERE'S THE PLUMP?,"The colors are very nice, but where's the plump?According to the manufacturer this lipstick will make lips wrinkle free and appear plumper. Maybe it's retroactive - there appears no difference to me."
2,"Great light, bad switch!!","I bought this flashlight about 6 years ago and it lasted about 5 years before the switch became intermittent. Sent it to Steamlight for warranty repair and they sent it back with everythingreplaced but the yellow shell. The flashlight started to fail(switch intermittent again)after 3 months and now I have come to realize Streamlight has manufacturing problem with the switch. I gave it two stars because the light output is the best for this price range, but the switch issue is the negative on this flashlight. Hope other folk get better results than I did. And no, I'm not sending the light back again, I am going to find another manufacturer for my needs."
4,Seems awesome so far,"I've had the flashlight for the better part of a year now. I don't use it TOO often, but so far on camping trips and stuff it has done its job flawlessly. I haven't had to change the batteries yet and it's still very bright. (All my previous flashlights would always seem to be in a perpetual state of dying..) It will definitely light up the forest in front of you during a late-night walk. And I love the size and shape... very nice and practical design.I do worry about just stuffing it in my bag because if something is lightly pressing the switch, the light will still come on until the pressure is removed, at which point it goes off because the switch has not actually been fully pressed.Might change my rating to 5 stars if it continues to exceed my expectations though."
1,Didn't Last Long,"I bought 2 of these a few months ago...one is so intermittent that it's not usable. Appears to be the switch or the tiny circuit board inside. Will return it to Streamlight ( must be prepaid) when I can. The other one still works. I expected better from a $30 flashlight. I like the size, shape and beam pattern."
1,Disappointedly short lived.,"I thought this was going to be a great replacement for my very old (for an led light) flashlight. I was wrong. When I first got this light I was very pleased with the size and impressive amount of light that it produced (almost too much light in fact). The switch has proven to be very disappointing. After only six months of service the light now only switches on when and how it wants to. Many times when I try to turn it on, I must try several times to get any response at all, and then it may light brightly, it may light at a very low level, or it may flicker for a while and then go out. This behavior occurs with alkaline or rechargeable batteries. My first led light lasted for over eight years; this one is useless and undependable in less than eight months."
5,Best Ever,This is the best flash light I have ever owned.It well light up the night. you can see as if it were daylight.
4,"Floody beam, perfect for tradesman or anyone in the dark about flashllights",You have to spend money to get a good product. This flashlight is one of the best when it comes to price vs. runtimes vs. brightness vs. durability. I can not think of one better flashlight that fills the niche like this little guy. It is a high performance product that has a great floody beam. This flashlight will not be suitable for a cop or for someone who needs a 200 lumen cannon to light up the other side of a ravine. This is for everyone else who is tired of $5- 25 crap flashlights on the market.
5,We've owned one before and it was very useful during Superstorm Sandy.,This flashlight model proved very useful during Superstrom Sandy so we decided to order a few more to have around the house. The flashlights were a known quantity and the transaction went very smoothly.
1,An immense talent - perhaps wrong vehicle,"Sam Ramey has a beautiful voice and is such a wonderful actor, (anyone who has seen him perform opera knows he's a great presence on stage - he also was great in the pseudo-staged production of ""On the Town""), that it is so disappointing not to like this album. However, if you're choosing between this album and anything by (Church, Bocelli, Watson, Garrett or Brightman),then PLEASE buy this instead. A great voice is still a great voice even if I feel Mr. Ramey doesnt seem particularly comfortable here.Sorry, just feel this one is left better sitting on the shelf."
1,HOT FLASH S HELP,I purchased this product after reading an article in my local paper from a lady thartsaid how much this product helped her/unfortunately it didnt do the same for me.
2,Difficult,"I own the Hohner Super Chromonica and thought this one would be a simple 12 hole that I could carry in my pocket. Problem is, the holes are so close together that it's difficult to play one note at a time. The Chromatic is much more comfortable to play despite its size."
3,Pretty good but not great,Right after the tournament this year I was desperate for a college basketball game. I got this one and was not disappointed but wasn't blown away either. The coaching mode leaves much to be desired. How about letting us start off as an assistant for crying out loud!! But the recruiting is okay and the gameplay is pretty good. On the hardest level on a good team's floor you can lose and will always have a hard time for example at Cameron indoor arena.If you want a college basketball game then it's a good buy but if you're just looking for a good game in general then there are certainly better ones out there.
3,"Good game, but major flaw","All in all this is a good game, except for the fact that the A.I has no defence skilz, every time u controll the ball u are able to drive, i scored 89 points, 80 of them were by driving."
1,This is not what is seems,"Was ripped when it arrived and looked like it had been through a washer and dryer, crumpled, shrunk, and cracks in the surface. Buy something else if you want a cover for your blackjack."
3,OK pool toy,"The jury is still out on this one. My kids are probably a little young for it and it is not well-suited for use in pools away from home, since its large and has various parts. You have to find the right thing to weigh down the rings. Water definitely doesn't work, large rocks don't either. I'll be trying sand or gravel next- the only problem being that younger kids might want to unscrew the lids to the weights and check out whatever you've put in. In addition, it is worth deciding how long you want the string connecting the weights to the hoops and at least cutting some of it off ahead of time. The game takes some experimentation and I haven't quite gotten everything ironed out quite yet. It does seem to have potential though judging from the kids' positive response to diving through the hoops when I've just held them.8/26/10 We're passing this one on to friends who have a pool. Its a fun toy but too much trouble to carry around and the pools we swim at are often too crowded for this."
2,Weights that don't drop far enough,I had a set of swim hoops as a child so i thought my nephew would enjoy them. Unfortunately the product is a bit weak. The sand filled weights weren't heavy enough and the rope that ties them to the rings is kind of flimsy. It was difficult to get them to sink and to stay put so we could line them up and swim through them. The whole set was kind of flimsy. Some company should go back to the old way of making them. We had hours of fun in the pool with this toy. Disappointing.
4,"Yes, the Bruch is amazing!","I have always believed that if you can fall in love with a certain work after having hated it up until that point, then the recording that changed your mind MUST be magical - it's a pivotal moment when you realise that anything can be made beautiful if put into the right hands. That was my story with the Bruch - Vengerov really puts so much of his own spirit and joy into the finale - so much life!As for the Mendelssohn, I would still rank Sarah Chang and Cho Liang Lin on top..."
1,Poor design,"I purchased these cuffs after testing a set of the steal cuffs without any issue. I though these cuffs would be lightweight and efficient. I found these cuffs are lightweight but the black plastic has a raised edge inside where the single bar passes through the double bar restricting it's free movement. I thought I could shave down the plastic to allow the single bar to pass freely but now the cuffs are unusable. I bought two pair, they both have these flaws."
3,ASP BLACK TACTICAL HANDCUFFS,"There were two problems I encontered with this handcuff. First, this particular brand is thicker than most handcuffs, so it didn't fit into my Bianchi dual handcuff holster. I ended up having to choose between my older handcuff and this, instead of having both of them on my duty belt. You will need to purchase ASP's dual holster to fit two if you really want it. Secondly, the swing arm that locks to the base gets stuck inbetween its two pronged holder, which makes it harder to ratchet around the wrist compared to my older handcuff. Other than that, this handcuff is light and could accomodate thicker wrists compared to my older handcuffs."
3,"Awesome cuffs, but not for police work...","I'll be straight with you, these are simply not realistic for actual police work. They can flex a little too much and in a situation with a struggling perp, have had occassion where the swing arm can get bent and miss the locking base entirely. Also if your perp happens to have a hidden key, the dual keyways on both sides insure he will be able to use it, regardless of the double lock feature. If your needing a pair for professional use, I suggest the ASP steel ones rather than these aluminum ones.Now what these are great for are some more 'extracurricular' activities that i'll leave untouched. These are very lightweight and comfortable to wear. The plastic overlay and the aluminum housing are plenty strong to prevent escape and simply dont dig into wrists like traditional handcuffs do. While they feel like their entirely plastic, I assure you they are not and quite inescapable."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this pump at Target. It pumps, but the check valve leaks, so the air just leaks back out through the pump. If I furiously pump and take the needle out really fast, I can get some air into the ball. Very poor quality. Not worth the money."
5,"Beautiful compositions, played with vigor and passion","It has taken me three decades to finally catch on to ""classicalmusic"" (I actually disdain these musical labels), and both the music of Brahms and the playing of the Borodin Quartet represent great discoveries for me. Listening to this has left me yearning for more music for strings (I welcome all suggestions). For now I have my ears set on Mendelssohn & Raff: Octets (Chandos - #8790 )."
4,Card Set Vocabulary,"The set is great but in order to use this card set to the maximum benefit, first learn the 200-300 most frequent words used in the GRE. A list of these words can be found in books published by Kaplan, Barron's, or Princeton Review. Learning these words first will provide a good base to get started and they do appear often. Most of these words are found in Set 1 and 2. However, the definitions on these card sets can be a bit wordy and trying to memorize the definitions verbatim can sometimes be tedious. For a excellent GRE vocabulary, make sure you already know the most frequent SAT vocabulary and buy Set 2! Good luck!"
3,Word list not very recent,"These cards are designed pretty well. Definiations are well written and easy to follow. Every word has a sample sentence along with the definition, which is very helpful.However, the word list is out of date. I did not see any of the words on the GRE Verbal."
2,not necessay,"this set of flashcards is definately not necessary for any one who has even average vocab. buy the following sets, but unless you need help with simple, everyday words loke ""literal"" ""covert"" or ""movement"" then save the money, and forget this product."
3,"Good for beginners, but not for fine-tuning","These flash cards are useful if you're really haven't been exposed to the words, but they're not good for fine-tuning your understanding. They'd be good for a non-native speaker or a beginner-- they might take you from a 400 to a 600 score, but not a 600 to 800. The problem is that the definitions are oversimplified: for example, compare their definition of ""acumen"" as ""insightfulness"" or ""diffident"" as ""lacking self-confidence"" to the definition in a good dictionary, and you'll see how much nuance is being lost, nuance that is essential when choosing which of several words is most appropriate. So, overall: quality good, format useful, but really just a starting place."
4,Pretty Good!,"I really liked this book. Rae, the main character in this book, is facing a lot of problems in her life. Her mother is in a bad mood most of the time and her father wants her to move to Chicago, away from the one thing she loves most- surfing! The only problem I had with this book is that Rae gets in a fight with her friends and she doesn't talk to them for two weeks! It's awesome how she pulls off the Day at the Beach. It's soooo inspiring and make you want to do something to make kids who have illnesses happier. Overall, this is a good read and I recommend it."
3,Contains Soy,"No where in the product description does it say that this product contains soy. After I opened it, I had to throw it out. I was disappointed because I have a soy sensitivity and sensitivities that have made me need to avoid certain types of capsules and use tablets instead."
5,BOOKSPART3!!!!!!!!!!,This books are very very particular for those painter who want to improve their skills............................good choice.
1,Rip off.,"This show is the exact same as the One Night In London DVD performance, but with pretty terrible quality. The reason I got it, the ""special guest: The Four Tops"" part, turned out to be clips of their previously released 40th anniversary DVD at the MGM Grand. Just buy those two DVDs seperately, as you'd then be getting better quality recordings of the same performances (and in the Four Tops' case, the full show).LAMEPS,If you stumble upon the Four Tops DVD of this same series (titled Bernadette), by all means get it. It's an otherwise unreleased performance from (I believe) 1999 or 2000. One of Levi's last with the Tops before his retirement from stage. Great stuff."
4,"5 deadly kats,,,,,,,,untouchable at the least",to have this former saturday special on dvd.life is not so bad after all....and the copy/dvd transfer is very decent.of course there are scratches-n-artifacts and some flickering but all of the most important fight scenes are clear.for 15 bucks put your bootleg vhs copy in the back of the closet and pick up this epic/classic.what these 5 deadly fighters can do with no computer effects is special.the sound is fair...i've definitely heard worse on a dvd.if you don't have a copy of this;you're not a true martial art fan.it's that simple.....
4,great fighting,this film has some excellent traditional style martial arts fighting. for the price the disc is great-sure it's not anamorphic but it's not fullscreen like most budget releases. only bad thing is that while it starts of in the correct 2.35.1 ratio it quickly becomes cropped to 16:9-sure that better than 4:3 but why crop it at all? still this can be forgiven at the price.
4,A good Venoms Movie,(4.5 for video transfer more like 3.75 for movie)This movie was pretty decent. The fighting was as you expect for the mid/late 70's Shaws movies (meduim fast). Great hand to hand and weapons work from Chang Cheh and Sun Chien. This is a must have for Kung Fu fans as this is as clear and crisp a copy that you are going to get!
4,Old school Martial Arts Movie,"This is classic Shaw Brothers production, terrible dubbing, but awesome martial arts."
5,The Kid Kicked Butt,I love this movie to death. If you love old school Kung Fu movies. This is a must.
3,"Good movie, bad DVD","I waited for delivery on this disc for many weeks. Boy, was I upset to find that whoever did the sound transfer must have been watching TV when he did his job. Throughout the entire movie there is background noise as if a news broadcast is going on in the next room. I didn't have any beef with the picture quality since it's such an old movie, but I did expect some semblance of prefessionalism in the creation of the disc."
1,Taped from TV,"The video on this DVD was taped from an edited television broadcast of the movie by pointing a video camera at a television. You can see the outline of the TV in the frame. The colors are horrible. Spend (...) more for the Ground Zero Entertainment DVD of this movie- letterboxed, gore intact, and actually watchable."
2,The movie itself - GREAT! This version on dvd - questionable!,"Again we all know this movie is a classic, it's just the company who put this release out on dvd did a poor job with it. I'm giving this dvd a 2 star rating because of the following. I can't remember the original version, but it seems that two parts of the movie are out of sequence. When the gold falls through the floor into the tunnel everyone starts fighting. But during the fighting people keep talking about how Iron Robe has set a ""signal"". Minutes later after the fighting is done, the movie proceeds to show Iron Robe taking away the gold and Hai To sneaking onboard underneath the cart. The cart's wheels fall off and this is where we actually see Iron Robe setting off the ""signal"". This is the only thing that bothers me with this dvd. Other than that the movie itself deserves 5 stars!"
2,don't buy the 5 dollar version. print quality is [poor],"..but you get what you pay for. i did get more than 5 bucks worth of fun out of this bad copy of a cool movie. the ... ""new/used"" version of this DVD of this movie is letter box only, (fine with me) and the image quality is terrible. the opening credits look like they were taped of TV on to VHS. now i have to buy the full price version of the movie too. BR>... both DVDs/cover art looks like somebody made them on a copy machine"
5,Kid with the Golden arm,Great Kung Fu movie. I love the Venoms. I love Phillip Kwok. The action in this movie is great. All Kung Fu No wire works on this movie.
4,Kung fu classic.,"The kid with the Golden arm is a true classic old school kung fu, there are lots of great fighters,exciting battles great all round kung fu action.As i always say don't look for great acting or imaginative story lines most martial art movies lack in that department, but! if you love action pack kung fu """"you bastarts you killed my master"""" then this definitely in the tridition. the end has a great plot to be revealed and i'm sure you will be pleased if you bought this dvd a must for your invincible collection later folks."
3,TOP 10 WITH HORRIBLE DVD QUALITY,"this is no doubt the venoms top 5 greatest and its my 2nd favorite and a top 10 no doubt but the dvd quality is horrible. bad sound, bad picture, and editing the gore. on top of all that this a canadian bootleg and never trust a bootleg from canada. now on the movie there is no doubt that the fight scenes are magnificent and between kuo chui and lo mang steal the show and a surprise ending that makes sense after you watch it about twice. i gave this a 3 all because of bad dvd and bootlegged quality. the movie itself is beyond a 5."
2,Just Cause as the union would have it.,"No employer should ever accept the ""Seven Tests"" as the standard for just cause; it is the arbitral equivalent of ""reasonable doubt"" and much too great a burden. Many public employers have foolishly incorporated this standard into their rules, their training, and even into their labor agreements. If you're in charge, eliminate any reference to it. Most experienced arbitrators will not apply this standard unless it is articulated in the agreement or one party, usually the union, proposes it and the other accedes. For a management representative in collective bargaining and labor arbitration the Seven Tests is at best a know your enemy course. It gets the two stars because it is informative and well written, just wrong."
5,Great 3 track UK import CD,"For those who like Offspring, you can't go wrong with this cd. It includes ""The Meaning of Life"", ""I Got a Right"" (previously unreleased), and a live version of ""Smash It Up"" which I believe was on the soundtrack of the latest Batman"
4,Impact of Christ well presented,"This book does a fine job of describing the positive impact of Jesus Christ upon Western Civilization, offering very specific examples relating to modern issues - role of women, slavery, economic reform, just to mention a few. It is exceptionally readable and useful for any layperson. Some limitations include a very limited schope, for example, most examples rest in the era of Roman empire and the misuses of Christian power as it became a dominant religion were glossed over."
1,Do not read this slanted political-religious.,"This was nothing more than a political-religious diatribe, pushing the author's own interpretation (often out of the main stream) of certain Christian principles. His history was poorly researched, and inaccurate in some instances. It is the worst religious book that I have ever read."
1,book full of false facts...,"The book should be lsted as fiction, and not under history or theology. Mr. Kennedy should keep his act to the TV, where he can present baseless facts. His subjective biased argument does not help in promoting christanity, a more obejective would. ""A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom"" by ANDREW DICKSON WHITE does a far better job in presenting an objective analysis on impact of christanity on science. Struggle of Gallileo with the chruch is complete mis-presented by Mr. Kennedy."
5,classic album,"Some may disagree but this is the best B.G. album to date. Chopper City 97' was great but I can listen to vol. 2 from beginning to end. Starting with the intro by the Big Tymers. I believe it was Mannie that said ""I didn't mean to mute ya playboy/ but I got rims bigger than your future"". I still use that line today. This album showed that Mannie can sample beats and bring the best out that track. You have to listen a little bit harder to know which tracks are samples. If there was a hip-hop hall of fame this album and artist would be there."
2,Very Dull,I found this book extremely dull. I can't believe this is the same author who wrote Wicked. I found myself wanting to quit this book or at least read another book along with it because it is slow and it rambles. Mr. Maguire flips back and forth between the Liir now and the Liir from Wicked. Sometimes there's no warning of the flipping. It's in the middle of the chapters and there's no rhyme or reason. Just sad that he felt the need to write this book without a clear picture in his head of what he wanted. I think this is a typical middle book of a series which he's obviously writing now since Amazon has up as a subtitle Wicked Years 2. Middle books usually are just about what is going to happen. Which based on the ending I think will be something wild. Oh well. I'll chalk this one up as a rush job and try to remember to pick up another one of his books sometime in the future.
2,Lacking,"You may want to read this book, most likely because of your familiarity with his other pieces. You may know he is a very talented writer. This book lacks all of the direction and coherence that Wicked offered, however, and comes off as a confusing plumb-the-depths-of-whatever-soul Bildungsroman. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Wicked and how little I enjoyed this. Alas."
2,Could have been so much better,"This started off with so much promise but fizzled in the end. The pace for the first 2/3s flowed well, defining the characters and tasks at hand. At a moment that changed the main character (Liir), the book also makes a drastic change from a crafted discription of the events of the life of the son of Elphaba to an all out sprint. I was left wondering what happened to the tale? Were the last 100 pages just thrown together so the book could have an ending? If it hadn't been for the beginning, I'd call this work garbage."
2,"Boring book, even more boring narrator","Perhaps I didn't care for this sequel because of the narrator: Maguire himself! I could hardly distinguish characters because Maguire barely mastered one voice, let alone several. Talk about monotonal. I hope next time he gets a real actor to actually engage the listener."
3,"OK, but was it necessary?","With Gregory Maguire's Wicked, we were treated to a fantastical reimagining of the Oz story, one a bit more cynical than the wide-eyed wonderment we got through Dorothy's perspective. It was also a fine examination of how perceptions can make one ""wicked"" or ""good,"" but carried on Baum's theme that a lot of our exalted leaders are really just humbugs.In Son of a Witch, Maguire continues on his exploration of the politics of Oz, centering his story around Liir, the putatitve son of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. The cynicism remains, and the delightful deconstruction of Oz continues apace. At the end of the book, however, I found it hard to conclude that Wicked was a book that begged for a sequel. Son of a Witch is fine prose, but it doesn't add anything to (to be fair, nor does it detract from) the very fine Wicked."
3,interesting though slow,"interesting story. some parts seem unnecessary and too drawn out. skimmed through some of the middle, but didn't seem like i missed much. a good read and sequel if you're just reading for the fun of it."
1,Poor Relation,"Wicked is one of the best novels that I have ever read. Son of a Witch is perhaps the worst, at least the worst written by a serious novelist. The book lacks everything that made Wicked a triumph: complex characters, thought-provoking allusions to contemporary and historical events, and masterful storytelling. Many of the same characters appear, including the title character, Lir, but they are all flatly drawn and down right boring. Even Shell, the younger brother of Elphaba and Nessarose, is boring. Given the expansive personalities of his sisters I would have thought that impossible. The last chapter of the book sets up a sequel to this sequel; if it's as bad as this book, we can only hope that Maguire keeps it to himself. Save your time and your money. Son of a Witch is a waste of both."
3,Muddled,"As most everyone starts, I too enjoyed Wicked and I also really liked Mirror, Mirror but this novel was a disaapointment.The first 200 pages of the book are a long journey for Liir, the main character, and for the reader of the novel as well. I have a dedication to finishing a novel when I start but it was a very difficult decision to continue this one.Maguire's writing is still quite poetic if a bit choppy in this particular work, but ultimately the end of the story is intriguing.I wouldn't rush out for this one."
2,Just okay,"Expecting the story to be a continuation of ""wicked"" and why would i think differently when the author promoted that way...really this story is all over the place, like the author is purposely trying to ""unwicked"" this book. only should read if your really, really a fan of this author. an example of all over the place...the character trism who comes between liir and candle...huh?.otherwise...go back to oz."
2,So...boring...,"Son of a Witch is the story of Liir, who may or may not be Elphaba's son, and what he does following her death. The answer to that is 'not a heckuva lot.' He wanders around, joins the army, meets with some birds...This is a profoundly boring book. It picks up at about the halfway point, but doesn't come to any sort of thrilling conclusion. In fact, this book seems like a bridge. As to what, I do not know. Apparently, there's a third book featuring a lion."
2,Son Of A Witch,Boring and rambling. This made it even longer and more difficult to read. It felt like the auther couldn't come up with any substance for the character and then threw in his own philosophysing. Too weird.
3,Not as good as the others,I found myself plodding through this one. Wicked was an absolute joy. This was more like work. It was overly long and had too many characters that did not advance the story line.
5,It's all good,"I'll keep this short. No need to retell the story. This coming of age histoire was interesting from start to finish. I did not expect a sequel, but expected to be dazzled by Maguire's imagination and writing style. I'm not disappointed. Oz politics aside, I found Liir's physical, emotional and psychological development very interesting and real. He is a survivor as so many men in the real world who face the same challenges -- icy parental guidance with little demonstrated love, learning how to accept and give love, the need to become strong physically and psychologically as a man, deciding and acting on values, and so forth. If one is not interested in character development, this book will not prove to be enjoyable. The ending was superb. Somewhere down the line Maguire will treat us to Liir's ability/inability to be a good father to a baby that appears to be the next witch in Oz. Can't wait."
4,Wicked sequel,"This book was good, but not as good as Wicked, of course. I still enjoyed it very much. It is very dark in parts and exciting. I think I did not like it as much as Wicked because I do not find Liir to be a very likeable character, still it was wonderful to be in Oz again and this book left me eager to read ""A Lion Among Men""."
1,Even worse than Wicked.,"Most people in reviews only criticize the writing in the book, but we all know that Maguire isn't a very good writer. The main problem with this book was the same as the first, only to a much greater degree. Maguire throws the history of Oz out the window and spits in the face of L. Frank Baum's creation. He changes characters and events and completely disregards them, rather than taking the intelligent option and merely writing his story around the original events. This book serves to frustrate the reader, no matter how many original Oz books they have read, but for someone who loves Oz, it is a complete insult."
5,Son of a Witch,"Gift for my Granddaughter, arrived in time for Christmas in great shape...Just as advertised...Love ordering from Amazon on line..."
3,a good read,"This second book by Maguire on the Witches is an interesting story about the son of the main character in the first book.The character is unusual,difficult to understand, undecided about himself etc. but it makes for an interesting read partially due to the other characters which dot the landscape.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,OK,"I read wicked and loved it, so I had to read son of a witch, It wasn't as good but I loved the end."
3,son of a witch,"i haven't actually started reading it yet, but hear it's not nearly as interesting as Wicked. However, the book arrived in good condition (but lacking that cool cover most of these books have), and arrived before the estimated time."
4,Story or political satire?,"As I read this book the haunting notion that I already knew this story kept floating to the surface. It was not until I heard an interview with Gregory Maguire that my notions were proven correct. This is a harsh book to get through. It is not a hard read but hard to read. Shocking at times but nonetheless it smack of a thin veil of our political climate, as sad as that it is, to reveal a masterful story. You go Elphaba!"
5,"Barbaric, disgusting at times, not what i expected at all...i absolutely loved it","Although not as good as Wicked was, Son of a Witch should be a noteworthy sequel to it. The book goes with a much different storyline then the first, and it seems that this book was only written to wrap what happened to Liir, and only raises more questions. Enough questions, infact that a third book might just be planned. Maguire recreates a magical world rich with detail and wonderment. Although i wish there was a little bit more character development, but hey, what can you expect from someone in a coma? But I am hoping for a third novel, at least to tie up some ends."
1,Expected as a sequel to a great book,"I am greatly disappointed after just completing the book. I dove right into it after finishing Wicked. I suppose, I should have just thought about it for a minute. A popular precursor? A sequel a few years later? What will it bring? Major disappointment.Combined with a boring plot (the writer seemed to get lost up until 250ish) and was stringing (barely) a few different situations together, which, in the end, came up to be a huge mangled mess with an open opportunity for a sequel.One thing that caught me off-guard with this novel was the romantic situation with Liir and Tism. What? Where the heck did this come from? Just did not seem to fit. A crush or something would have been acceptable and would fit perfectly because of Liirs' past and his lack of a father figure, but to create a big love triangle right at the end, what?Full attention is needed for this book. You will be reading and suddenly get ADD. BE WARNED!"
4,Entertaining,"I really did not think I was going to like this book, The first chapter started out too violent. I am glad that I kept reading. I read it within a week of reading Wicked, and I really enjoyed it. It was great having some of the OZ characters, that I was familiar with, along with new charters. Wicked was different, a little strange because you know the fate of Elphaba. THere was more suspense in this one. I plan on reading more of this authors books, and well as the original OZ stories."
2,I Wanted To Enjoy This Book,"I guess my mistake was thinking that this was actually going to address the title of the book. After dragging myself through parts of this book, I found that in the end there were way too many loose ends and an obviously stage setting for a sequel. This never works for me, and surely didn't here. If you are looking for any answers this book is not going to reveal them. Wicked was great, this one is not!"
3,Pretty good if you liked the first one,"If you're looking for resolution, don't read this book. But if you just want a continuation of this version of Oz, it's not a bad story."
3,Narration matters,"Author Gregory Maguire chose to narrate this reading of Son of a Witch. Wicked was narrated by John McDonough. Maguire's narration is adequate, and had he narrated Wicked, I would be more satisfied. But McDonough's narration was so good, Maguire's is a let down. This feeling is significant, because while Son of a Witch is an interesting story, the charm of Wicked fades as Maguire moves farther a field of the generally understood Oz universe. McDonough's soothing voice might have helped overcome some of this sequel's shortcomings.As to the story, I did find it entertaining. None of the characters are as rich as Elphaba was in Wicked, but the plot moves well enough to be engaging. I was surprised at Maguire's portrayal of Glinda. It is as if Macguire, in his desire to be more edgy and real, has decided that a character of genuine goodness is too unrealistic. If there is a third book, I wonder if he will address Glinda's future role as guide, mentor, and mother figure to Ozma."
4,Good sequel to Wicked,"After finishing reading ""Wicked"" I couldn't help but reading Son of Witch. All in all I enjoyed it a lot, but not quite as much as Wicked. I agree with other reviewers that some parts are a bit dull, and it slows down for a while towards the middle. However the end picks up again and it has a nice and surprising twist that is worth waiting for in my opinion."
4,"A Good, if not Great Sequel","The one thing that really disappointed me in this sequel to Wicked is that the one question we all want to know, ""Is Liir Elphaba's son?"" is never blatanly answered. (Although you can infer the answer from the last line of the novel.) Other than that this book is pretty good. Very Gregory Maguire. It kept me anxiously reading from the very beginning.One note. One of the reviewers says that Nor is Elphaba's daughter. This is not true. Nor is the daughter of Fiyero and Sarima. She is their only daughter. Just wanted to clear that up."
3,son of a witch,"A fairly worthy sequel to ""Wicked"" however a big problem with the author reading the text in the CD version. Just like ""Wicked"" , a well thought out book although a little intellectual for some, it unfortunately mirrors what is going on in our society today with a very perceptive plot. The book and plot are very good and well thought out but unfortunately, allowing the author to read is a big mistake. Gregory Mcguire may be able to craft a well written book, but he certainly is a very poor choice to perform the reading. Mcguire is very stilted and stiff in his delivery and, although he tries very hard, a very unconvincing and poor oral story teller. It would have been much better to have a professional reader do the job."
4,Wow,I thought this book was so mysterious. It got confusing at times because it kept switching parts of the story and sometimes i forgot where i was in the book. but other than that it was so good. i was really suprised at how liir grew throughout the book. and some of the things he did. and dorthy what a two faced person after reading this and Wicked i can't watch the wizard of oz withought feeling bad and yelling at dorthy. it was very well done detail wise. i felt i could really connect with the plot and what was going on. i hope a seqal comes out for this one if not i'll be dissapointed.
2,REALLY wanted to like it...but I hated it.,"I've read all Maguire's books, I'm starting to think that Wicked was just a brilliant fluke because not only have I been steadily disappointed by every thing else after but he is now approaching the point of being just unreadable to me. If you've read Lost, and you feel as I do that it was just the most awful stuff put to paper, then trust me, you will think this book stinks. It's a meandering, pointless, thunderous bore; I hated the protaganist Liir, he's a pathetic, wimpy character and I am p*ss*d that keep buying this guy's books because they always look so promising. Though I can never bring myself to throw a book away I want to toss this dumb thing in a land fill, I'm so annoyed! Never again!"
4,This has never happened to me before!,"I know a lot of reviewers found this book rather dull. I understand. There were times when it was on the verge of boring, and the one thing that saved it for me was knowing that this was Oz, after all, where anything is truly possible.However, I want to tell everyone what I really thought of this book upon reading it from beginning to end.This book was absolutely worth reading for the VERY LAST SENTENCE ALONE.That has NEVER happened to me!It is also critical as a link in the series, and additionallt, the last book makes this well worth reading."
4,Interesting Read,"I normally go for thriller/suspense/scary books. But a coworker suggested I read Wicked, Son Of A Witch etc. since my favorite movie is The Wizard Of Oz. He thought I would enjoy a different spin on the classic story, and he was right! While at times the dialogue can be difficult to follow, so far this series has been a great read. Definitely not for children, but I'd certainly recommend it to others. It's a bit slow most of the time but interesting enough to keep me wanting to read & now I'm so far into it that I have to find out how this series concludes."
5,Wicked Continued,"This is a perfect sequel to Gregory Maguire's Wicked. Elphaba's legacy lives on, and the reader cannot wait to find out who Liir is and what is to become of him. The ending this book really confirms that Elphaba will never be forgotten."
2,Read it if you want no questions answered,"I really enjoyed the first book in this series Wicked. I thought it was quite enjoyable but it left you with many questions, Was Liir her son? What happened to Nor? And I thought that these would be answered in Son of a Witch. Well...they're not. Liir's mother is only slightly hinted to in the last sentance of the book and *SPOILER ALERT* you never find out what happened to Nor!! That was 3/4 of the reason I read the book. Plus you also never find out what happened to Candle or the Maunuts. It's like Maguire left room for a whole other novel at the end of this book. There are WAY too many unanswered questions that made me so angry I wanted to throw the book across the room when I was done! Don't waste your time reading this if you think you're going to get any type of answer out of it!!"
3,"Awesome story, horrid rendition","Gregory Maquire did a masterful job writing the story of Elphaba's son in this unplanned but completly fitting sequel. However, the quality of his narration just doens't match up. He breaks the sentances in wierd places, giving a disjointed feel to the audio that is hard follow. Unlike a voice actor, he is also not proficient in giving unique and appropriate voices to the different characters. I hope Maquire writes many many more books, but lets the professionals do the audio."
2,Resolves nothing from Wicked,"I was disappointed. This book lacks the passion of Wicked, and it doesn't really continue the story from the original book. It tells a largely unrelated tale about Liir, who is fairly insignificant in Wicked. It isn't really even the story of Liir but more like a sequence of events that he drifts through. So beyond being disappointed that nothing from Wicked is resolved in this book, I didn't find the story engaging. Liir is never passionate about anything he does, which leaves the reader wondering, who cares? Fans of the original book will want to read it anyway. Others shouldn't bother -- but do read the original. And see the musical. Both are outstanding."
3,A Bridge Over Troubled Witches,"This novel is at most a transitional novel to take readers away from their attention on Elphaba (who, after all, melts as we know from OZ) and straining it towards Liir, her possible son.What should have been one clever book about the back story ofthe Wicked Witch of the West is turning into a series with thispiece. The author wishes us to believe there is more than one story here, but, alas, we are unconvinced since he takes us onlyso far without much result. I found such contrivance a disappointment. Part of writing is knowing how and when to end a tale."
2,disappointed,"I typically love Gregory MacGuire's books, however this book was a huge disappointment.This book was very slow moving..very little action. I never came to like and or care about Liir, sadly I was happy to see the book end."
5,One of my Favorite Christmas Presents...,"I absolutely loved the first book - and loved this one just as much. These books have also inspired me to read all the Original ""Oz"" books - And see how the stories match the world that Baum created... So far so good! I could see a third book coming -- and hope it does."
1,Completely Unnecessary,"I loved Wicked so much, and as others have stated Son of a Witch was such a huge disappointment. I was two hundred pages into the book wondering when the action was going to take place. This sequel does not add a thing to the original story, and I feel like readers are better off wondering what happened to the characters of the original rather than reading Son of Witch."
4,A worthy sequel,"If I have to complain about something, I'll complain about the characterization of Dorothy, who seemed very differnt from the way Maguire drew her in ""Wicked."" There are also times when the dialogue feels unnatural and forced.However, I loved the themes of the story and how even the structure of the book relates to those (memory, the past, family ties). While ""Wicked"" tells how Elphaba becomes a hard, stubbord, driven and solitary creature... ""Son of a Witch"" tells how her son stops being solitary, purposeless, and ""talentless."" The characters are quirky and interesting, the plot is remarkably believable despite the magical creatures and technicolor landscape, and the emotions are raw and irrestistable."
1,very boring.,Didn't really enjoy the first one but it was much better than this one. Story is just plain boring.
1,rushed the sequel,"I really liked Wicked, but this sequel was awful. it felt like maguire rushed to write it to appease the publishers...or he was just trying to get it done and out of they way. either way, it was a terrible follow up to Wicked."
2,A bland sequel to a great book,"While I absolutely loved Wicked, Son of a Witch screams of Maguire's want to capitalize on its success. There are some interesting passages within the book, albeit generally slow, but you won't find anything as creative or interesting as those in the original.Liir, the book's main character, feel two-dimensional and lacks a life-like personality. It is true that he is on a search for himself, but he just doesn't seem to find it. The book fumbles around for some point, some climax, but there isn't anything of the sort.Also, the inclusion of the original Oz characters feels gimmicky at best. They spout boring, predictable phrases that make me long for the innovation of Wicked.The book isn't terrible, but it's clearly a corporate move, rather than an actual want on Maguire's behalf to farm his creativity."
2,When a good idea goes bad...,"Son of a Witch: Volume Two in the Wicked Yearsis probably one of the biggest disappointments I have ever encountered. I LOVEDWicked. LOVED IT. Yes, loved it so much it deserves all capital letters. Twice. I wrote my law school entrance essay on the importance of perspective shift and how reality is affected by where one stands in the world. I loved Elphaba from page one. I read it and reread it. I could not wait for the sequel. And then I read the sequel. Wow. How can an author who wrote such a dynamic world populated with such interesting and original characters - characters who retained their resemblance to the iconic selves in the original Baum books, yet were entirely new and original themselves - produce a sequel so lackluster, so monotonous, so completely and utterly and dreadfully boring? (And then he produced another. Which we won't even mention. Seriously.)"
2,Sequel to Wicked,This is the sequel to Wicked. It was slow to get going but eventually got it's rythm. Rather disappointing.
1,Horrible waste of money and time-very disappointing,"TOTALLY unnecessary homosexual themes added toward the end of the book-very angry I had read almost the entire thing and then was bombarded with homosexual agenda at the very end. Very unnecessary to plot and characters, did not add anything to the story and if anything detracted from the credibility of the author and quality of the story. This book is going in the trash and I will NOT be buying the third installment in this series. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Pathetic,"Why is it movie producers and best selling authors feel compelled to send us dreck on the heels of a tightly crafted story well told? Presumedly greed and a profound disregard for the intelligence of the audience drive this. Son of a Witch barely aspires to being a sophomoric (sorry to the sophomores out there) ode to teenaged angst told against a backdrop of the Sound of Music, Dr Doolittle, Lord of the Rings, and The Wizard of Oz all stewed into a thin soup served in a very shallow bowl. One Star because zero wasn't a choice."
1,Really Bad,"This book is not good in any way. It's a collection of poorly imagined pieces of a novel. The fun from the original, the reimagining of Oz, is gone, and we are left with some dreck that Maguire stirs around which comes to nothing in the end. Maguire needs to get a real editor and stop writing endless scenes of bland, characterless dialogue that don't mean anything to the story at large. I seriously cannot tell you how disapointed I am in this book. If you are looking for a pointless paperback fantasy, this book will be fine. If you are looking for something literary, look far from here."
1,Huge Disappointment,"First I should say that I did not read Wicked but saw the touring musical. I loved the show and was excited to read the sequel. What a huge disappointment. The book is dark, dreary, and depressing. It could have more successfully functioned as a short story as most of the book dwells on Liir either denying his lineage or whining about his lack of direction in life. His character is poorly developed, in fact, it's not developed at all until the end of the book and even then he still let's life happen to him. And what a poorly concocted ending that merely sets up another book to milk the Oz name. Hopefully the talented folks who put the Broadway musical together can lend their magic to this sequel and do justice to the character of Elphaba we fell in love with on stage."
1,Grostec,This book is horrible. The world of frank l. baum is twisted from a lovable happy place in to a barbaric and nausiating tragedy. if you are an ancient old lady who reads the hoorifying romance novels this is for you.
1,Son of Witch no match for Wicked,"Got this for my daughters, 13 and 23. They both found it boring basically due to the reader's voice and style. It was so unstimulating that they couldn't tell me if the story was interesting or not."
1,Son of a ....huh?,"Well, after being quite bowled over by the imagination and artful insight that Gregory Maguire showed in 'Wicked' I was excited at the thought of a sequel: so much so that actively sought it out for some months.What a disappointment!In a world that no doubt has changed since the death of the main protagonist of the first novel, the character of Liir is simply not interesting enough to warrant the energies of reading the novel.The insights, in flashback, into aspects of 'Wicked' along with what could have been a very touching finale (if one had not lost interest some 200 pages earlier) were the only redeeming features of one of the most difficult reads of recent times.Don't bother."
1,What a downer,"""Wicked"" had some odd plot points that made it difficult to read, but this book is impossible. And so depressing. I quit half-way through and threw it away."
1,does mr maguire have any training as a writer?,"what please was the point to this book?Fine, I get that this kid was trying to find himself, but why was the author looking for his storyline as well? He tied up to plotlines except the elephant queen, & frankly I could care less about any of his characters. It was a wasted read. (I had not read wicked BTW, so I am not comparing here)"
3,A satisfying sequel to Wicked,"Even though it turns out the witch was a terrible mother, you can't quite condemn her since her son does the right thing, after much hesitation and interesting tangential adventures."
5,A better sequel,"Actually I thought that ""Wicked' was a very good novel--great really, if, like me, you've always been fascinated since childhood by the movie ""The Wizard of Oz"". Definetely should only be read AFTER reading ""Wicked"". Yet, strangely the stronger of the two works-- more coherent and orderly in its presentation. Another advantage is that ""Son"" takes you into new territory, beyond the retelling/re-interpretation of the well-known ""Wizard"" storyline that ""Wicked"" explores--a venture into what exactly did happen in Oz after Dorthey returned to Kansas?"
3,just okay,"easy to read, thanks to the Maguire's style, but more of a transitional book than one to stand by itself. what's next? the return of the witch?"
3,Complicated...,I read this book when it first came out and I really liked it. Some of the parts were very confusing though. Some chapters I would read threw multiple times and I did not get them still. I got the main idea of the book and that was good.
1,The author should have stopped with Wicked!,This book contains long periods of boredom with minimal amount of interest. It is a true let down from it's predecessor. The author should have stopped while he was ahead.
1,Huge Disappointment,"I really enjoyed Wicked, and when I saw that there was a sequel I got really excited. I didn't really know what kind of storyline could be created with Liir, so I was very curious to see where Maguire was going with this. I have never been so let down by a book in my entire life. The whole book seemed pointless to me because it didn't go anywhere, and everything Liir set out to do was never accomplished. The ending was also terrible. I don't even want to read the third book because this one was so bad. Do not buy this book! If you must read it get it from a library, don't waste your money."
2,Son of a bore....,"I'm not sure exactly what other customers are reading, but I found this book interminable wit but a scant few highlights. Yes, I get the themes of finding yourself and forgiving yourself but this book is SO boring. I'm pretty sure I spent the longest time reading this book, wondering why I was continuing at all. From the longwinded descriptions(do we REALLY need 1,000 detailed descriptions of the Kells?) to the story that sometimes gets interesting for a few pages then slides back into it's neverending descriptions of events that most authors would spend a line or two on. Not sure why he wrote this as it really adds nothing to the mythos of the world he borrowed and made his own. VERY dissapointed."
3,A disappointment for Maguire fans.,"This was really not Maguire at his best. Liir, who didn't show a whole lot of promise in ""Wicked"", fulfills it in ""Son of a Witch"". While I agree with the other reviewers who say that Liir is basically kinda boring, I would also add that his ability to commit violent atrocities, large and small, pretty much isolates him from any possibility of reader sympathy. He doesn't feel particularly bad about them afterward. In fact, his emotional detachment is probably the biggest problem of the book, along with the lack of any particular resolution-- just a small twist at the end that you will probably see coming from a long way away."
1,Stick To Writing !!,"Maguire is a fine writer but is way out of his league narrating. His voice and inflection are downright disturbing. At times his reading takes on a monotonic, robotic tone that sounds like Robby the Robot! I hope there is another edition ot there because I don't think I can make it through listening to him. And I do listen to audio books all the time!bob"
4,What's missing for me here...,"as in ""Wicked"", is an understanding of what makes Oz tick. Since all the high-profile actors (Glenda, the military commander, Shell, and so on) are just puppets being manipulated by the real controllers, who are the real controllers? They never show up, or show their hand.Despite my lack of admiration for Liir, who is rather untalented and amoral compared with Elphaba, I'm still interested in the next installment."
4,Great Book,"I bought this book for my grandfather, it came fast and in perfect condition. He was extremly pleased!!"
2,Book review,I bought this book (in a series) for my teenage daughter. She was not very impressed with them.
4,Good read,"A very good continuation of the story that began in Wicked. If you enjoyed Wicked, you should read Son of a Witch."
1,sonofawitch,"Didn't care for this one. I really liked ""Wicked"" but just couldn't get into ""Son of a Witch"". A bit too fantastical for me."
2,What a mess...,"I loved Wicked so I was looking forward to this book. The book seems to have several stories it's building and none of them go anywhere. It's as if it is setting up for another book. A couple of the story lines don't even seem to have much relevance. Personally, I thought it was a mess."
1,If Wicked Left You Wanting More....,"then reading this book and reading the rest of the books in the series will not quench that thirst. If you like laborious melancholy tripe, then this is your book. Personally, the author didn't make me care whether or not Liir was Elphaba's son, which is the main question in the book. There is not anything compelling here, don't waste your time."
3,Son of a Witch is awful,"I listened to this book on CD. This book was awful. I kept wondering when Liir was going to grow a spine and speak up.If this is the author's answer of telling us what happened to Nor, Liir's half sister. The author can go back to the drawing board or in this case the writing board and start over.Borrow this book, don't buy it. Waste of money."
2,Son of a Witch: A Novel,"I read and loved Wicked, so had to read this one. But, it is adolescent and inconsistent in tone compared to Wicked. It has characters that make cheap sarcastic comments that are completely out of character, but instead seem to reflect whatever the author's mood was the day he wrote it. The most annoying thing is an unexpected and disturbing, homosexual relationship that left me feeling dirty and sick."
4,Good,"Interesting tale but a bit too introspective at times. Overall storyline is very imaginative, I will be reading the next book in the series."
3,Expected more.,"I was hoping for a little more closure, but I was left with a set-up for yet another sequel. Quit stringing me along..."
1,Lost time.,"I liked Wicked. He did a great job creating a backstory and giving the characters depth. The ""big"" events in Wicked didn't need to be written as we're to remember them from the movie. Son of a Witch was written in the same way (i.e. just mentioning big events) but without giving the characters any depth. Just poorly done all the way through. Constantly waiting for something to happen, for some suspense to be created, but it didn't happen. Since I've only read two of his works, I don't know if he phoned this one in as a way of cashing in on the musical or if this is par for the course. What I do know, however, is that I won't be finding out 'cause I won't be spending any more money on his novels. Unfortunate."
5,Second Best Book Ever,"This book is only second to its predecessor, Wicked: The Life and Times of The Wicked Witch of The West.Both books weave an intricate and dark tale the likes of which I have never read before. Sad, tumultuous, romantic, wonderful...you'll never see Glinda the Good Witch the same way again! For those who grew up with the old movie, this is not the perky little tale of Dorothy and her friends finding they had what they needed all along, this story leaves you sympathizing with the ""bad"" guy (wicked witch) and loving her and her family very much. I read each book twice, and have now purchased every novel written by Gregory Maguire."
4,Son of a witch,"This picks up where Wicked left off. It resolves some issues of Liir's birth and helps him resolve some of his childhood issues. He continues his mother's search for Nor and just misses finding her. He continues looking for Nor thoughout the book. Along the way, he meets up with numerous characters from the original book. It is well worth the read if you are a Wicked fan. The ending definitely left me wanting more and hoping for another sequel."
3,"entertaining read, not magical","I liked it. I think it had some unnecessary rehashing of the politics of Oz, which slowed it down. Liir is an interesting character, the ""everyman,"" and the weight of his deeds weighs as heavily on him as Elphaba's cloak. I found ""Wicked"" to be a satisfying read, but at times dull, and the same is true of this book. It's a bit preachy, yet some of the sexuality seems out of place. Overall, a good read, but not fantastic. The ending was in some ways expected, but when it ended I couldn't help but think, ""Oh, set up for the sequel,"" leaving this book unfinished. So, in closing, entertaining and well written, but I wouldn't read it twice."
3,Boring,"I remember watching ""Wicked"" the musical and loving its wit and its cleverness. The sequel to ""Wicked"" the novel, ""Son of a Witch"" is a huge disappointment. There's very little plot, and it just meanders on pointlessly."
3,Was it Worth the Wait?,"When you love a book as I loved Wicked, there is nothing better than a sequel. Our imagination doesn't have to do all the work! In this case, however, don't get your hopes up too high. While the story is worth reading, Son of a Witch doesn't possess the same ""depth"" as Wicked. While the book provides the same intelligent and challenging writing style, Liir is the only character fully explored. I also found myself unsatisfied by the ending, not that it was comedy or tragic, but the main plot (finding Nor) was unsolved. Unless there are plans for another book, your imagination will have to do."
2,What a colossal waste of time!,"Like others, I also enjoyed Wicked and have read it numerous times, but I've been disappointed by all of Maguire's other forays into this genre. This book, however, was by far the most disappointing. There should be a warning label on the cover that says, 'Warning! This sequel is nothing more than a setup for yet ANOTHER sequel.' Virtually nothing actually happens in this novel; it only opens up questions for the writer to try and suck you into a series. There's nothing wrong with series, however the writer should try and make each book stand on its own. This book does not do that. There is absolutely no closure and I actually found myself angry once I had finished it. If only Maguire could give me back the portion of my life that I wasted on this novel."
4,Good book. Good buy.,"The book itself was in very good condition and worth every penny. The story itself is a good read and is a very decent sequel to Wicked. If anything, it may be even better."
1,The book itself,I cannot truthfully review the contents of the novel because its physical form was compromised. Pages 213-229 are missing. I went from Candle with a goat straight to Liir with a Heron. I don't even want to finish it.
2,Meh,"Like many other reviewers noted, this story lacked action. The main character was reactive, rather than pro-active, and it really started to drag after awhile. Not nearly as clever or entertaining as his anti-heronie mother, Liir's constant identity angst became grating very quickly. Although there were some good moments, overall the story really seemed to lack direction, and the ending was weak."
2,What a letdown,"Wicked was so good that I didn't question it's sequel. Until I read it.Son of a Witch is very disappointing. Liir's character is poorly developed. The plot was missing something...like an actual plot perhaps. I had a hard time following the story because none of it made any sense. The story just follows Liir around while he runs away from everything (from Kiamo Ko, the army, Elphalba's memory) and leaves many dead ends. Perhaps the author meant to leave loose ends to be able to make another sequel, but I won't be running to buy it."
2,"Random, disjointed, and totally unbelievable","I have to admit I thoroughly enjoyed ""Wicked"", and like many was willing to enter that world again. Unfortunately, ""Son of a Witch"" is just poorly written. We follow a sullen, joyless boy who steadfastly insists that there is no possibility that he is interesting or talented in any way. Unfortunately, he's right.The book is full of non sequiturs both emotionally and in the logic of the story line, including: a completely random episode of homosexual sex, a life changing experience that seemingly makes no impression on the character (not the sex), a random appearance of a wizard like character, and immaculate conception of a child.Who let this book go to press?"
2,Sometimes you have to finish what you started,"I really wanted to like this book. I was a big fan of Wicked and wanted to see more of that world. But this book just one big story about a sullen young man that really has no idea what he wants or where to go. There was some of the book that I enjoyed but the majority was just boring. I seldom finish a book that I find slow but sometimes you have to finish what you started. Others have said that the ending of the book was just tossed together to add an ending but to me the ending of the book seemed like there was no ending just a ""too be continued."" And that is a follow-up story that I will have to skip.2 Stars for some good parts, but not much more."
3,Over priced,"I bought one of these for 30.00,Brand new. Though this is a nice item I would not pay the price."
3,Found the same item locally cost 1/3 less.,"A very nice unit as a cooler and a table on a boat. Easy to carry to the boat too. Unfortunately, I found the same unit for a member special 1/3 less price."
2,coleman cooler,The Coleman 40 Quart Cooler seemed very good when I bought it. The merchandise was dirty with sticky goo when it came and I have to wash the cooler before giving it away. I feel the price of 40.00 was way too much for the cooler.Coleman 40-Quart Wheeled Cooler
3,Not quite good.,"The handle on this cooler is too short. At 5'5"", I am the shortest person in my family, and even I had to stoop over a bit to roll this thing. Taller members found it downright uncomfortable to haul. If you lift up on the handle so that you can stand upright, the cooler tilts far back toward the wheels and at times fell over on its short side. Filled with drinks and ice it gets very heavy, and is difficult to move even with the wheels. To anybody at Coleman: please invent a cooler with four wheels, (with a collapsible long handle) that you can roll along like a baby stroller. My aching back will thank you. On the plus side, the coldness of the thing was great. To experiment, I have not emptied the cooler since our picnic over 48 hours ago, and there is still ice in there and the drinks are still cold."
3,Wheels and axel take up too much space,"When I received this cooler, I was disappointed that the wheels and axel result in a relatively large chunk of the inside of the potential cooling space being taken up by a ""shelf"" to house these. I sent this back in exchange for a bigger cooler with smaller wheels and a different design and ended up happier. That said, if I had read the description of this item more carefully, I might have been fairly warned. I would suggest looking at this carefully to be sure that it will have enough useable cooling space to meet your needs. The handle and wheels looked really sturdy, so that's a plus."
2,Leak after a few used,"We listed this on our wedding registry last year and my friend got it for us.Although we haven't gone camping, we used this a handful of time when transporting food from one home to another (for potluck, party, and such). Overall, our usage of this cooler has been gentle.We really like the size and the cup holders. It also seem to keep food cold. However, only after handful of gentle usage, the bottom start to leak. Since the cooler is useless now as it cannot hold liquid (ice will eventually melt and become water), I cannot recommend this product."
4,Just Fine,This product is exactly as described. It is relatively light and the wheels work well. Items inside stayed cool and the four cup holders on the lid are a nice touch.
4,pretty good,"Pros: Good value for the money. Good quality photos. Preset settings such as ""museum"" are handy. Good quality LCD. I like the Date Stamp feature, my Canon's was limited.Cons: Size, it's kind of bulky. Uses USB mini instead of the standard size, can be a pain when managing all of your cords on your desktop. I've charged the battery twice and when placing it back in the camera I had to reset my date/time, my Canon did not need to do this. Does not have a ""panoramic"" feature that lets you combine several photos together that Canon has. The Kodak ""small"" camera bag is not so small."
2,Not so happy,"I am no photo expert, I count on the camera to be smarter than me and take great shots on the fly. The Kodak EasyShare Z730 does not do that for me. Almost always slightly fuzzy, touchy in room light and almost useless in darker settings. I bow to those other reviewers whose knowledge of cameras makes this a great choice for them. I would suggest that if you, like me, lack the skills and knowledge but would still like to score the occasional decent photo then this camera is not for you."
2,kodak easy share camera,"Disappointed in condition. No memory stick or manual or instructions came with camera. Had to print owner's operating manual, all 46 pages, to learn how to use camera. Have had no success taking photos. Will not buy another electronic device from Amazon.Kodak EasyShare C340 5MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom"
1,unreliable!!!,"from purchase the flash only worked on ""special"" settings!! had to send in for repair. within 3 months the lens worked only intermitently. within 2yrs it was dead!!!"
4,Durable - Affordable - Capable,I purchased this camera brand new for a fraction of the price of my first digital camera. This is my second point and shoot digital camera since I have abandoned film.It is a very solid and durable and it takes beautiful pictures. It has almost no shutter lag time and the battery has never run out on me. I have used it on an entire week long vacation without re-charging it.Kodak keeps making these cameras better and more reliable for less.
5,awesome camera,"I had some gift cards so I went to buy my first digital camera. I went to a local electronics store and I had a certain financial cap. I wasn't thrilled with my choices but this camera caught my eye and I just fell in love with it. I spend more than I had planned but it was 100% worth it. the camera is very easy to hold, its not too small, and its not too big. It fits easily into my purse. the pictures are beautiful, the battery life is great and I have yet to exceed the amount of pictures I can store. I have over 300 now on the extended battery. The only gripe I have is having to reset the time every time I put the battery back in. its a minor inconvenience. The screen on the back is larger than a lot of them out now. that was a major deciding factor.. that and a good zoom. It has a very nice silver color too.for my first digital camera, this was a perfect choice."
5,A combination of genres that equals pure enjoyment!,"Psych, crime...comedy? As a huge fan of crime dramas I decided to give Psych a shot after seeing a commercial on tv. It did not disappoint. In fact, it completely flew by my expectations and I can now say I am addicted. This is the one show that I literally laugh out loud with every episode. I love the pop culture references. It reminds me of Gilmore Girls, but this reaches beyond the female demographic. Please give this show a try; you won't be disappointed!As for the dvds, add to your cart and wait for the price to drop to a reasonable level. At only 16 episodes per season I wanted to be sure to pay no more than $1 per epsisode. The price dropped a little while ago and I snatched it up."
4,My favorite series,"The series was shipped very securely in its cardboard box. The only complaint I have is one of the discs skipped a little on the first play of it. I could have put a finger print on the disc causing this though. I saved so much money buying it here, though, so thanks for that."
5,Perfect!,This product was delivered exactly as advertised and I had it in my hand within a week of ordering!
4,"""Talk Derby To Me""","I am extremely fond of ""Psych""; also, I am a serious fan of the (undefeated!) Memphis Hustlin' Rollers. So I was delighted to see that there would be an episode that revolved around Women's Flat Track Roller Derby. There were some things they stretched or invented for the sake of the plot; other things they got right. The one thing they absolutely should not have done was have O'Hara hit another skater in the face and continue to skate in the bout (as well as brag about the hit later). That's a serious foul and she would have been automatically expelled from the bout. If Shawn had gone undercover as a minor league baseball pitcher (no more unrealistic than an untrained, inexperienced O'Hara going uncover as a Derby skater), I cannot imagine that he would have been allowed to deliberately hit the batter."
2,Disappointed in Season 3 of Psych,"I've gone only halfway through Season 3 of Psych and am disappointed by it. The first episode appeared to be two separate stories/shootings that they slapped together. None of the ""zip"" in the first two seasons. And Cybil Shepherd as Shawn's mother? Gimme a break! Somebody might have owed somebody a favor. I noticed that Roday and Hill have been credited as ""co-executive producers"". If this is true, then it often means one thing: Money for good, original, creative writing is cut back so the big boys can make bigger bucks for themselves. This has happened with other series ... and is usually an omen that the series will go downhill and fold."
2,less than ok picture quality,"I have to say I am surprised others haven't mentioned that the video transfer of the regular DVD set (not the BlueScreen) is not so good. The episodes were unwatchable on my plasma, so I used the Blu Ray machine on my hd lcd to watch these and even then the quality was very poor for much of half the episodes. I returned the first set and received a replacement from Amazon with THE SAME EXACT FLAWS... the first episode of each disc has as much as half the episodes totally grainy, like some really bad vhs copy was used to burn the dvd. And parts of other episodes have the same thing going on. If I didn't get this on sale, I would return it again for refund. Now I don't know if this is some mistake or an attempt to ""encourage"" us to go to blue screen, but this is the worst quality dvd I've seen... even worse than home movies!"
1,Psych,It came with 2 of the disks loose and they were scratched. We didn't know how scratched they were till we tried to watch them and they would skip. I am hopeful to be able to return them and get a new undamaged copy
5,"Very funny, Good series to chill out and laugh.","I choose this rating because I really did love it, I love the actors they played there parts well. I would the 3 series I have see to anyone who needs to get away from the stress of the day, sit back with a coffee and allow these actors come to life in your living room."
5,Excellent Review of Presidential Health,"Dr. Karl Wold gives readers an excellent and detailed analysis of the health of Presidents Washington thru FDR. He includes a short bibliography at the end of each chapter. Although the book was published in 1948, and is now somewhat dated, it is must reading for any serious student of presidential history. He was one doctor, who early on, wrote an article concerning the deteriorating health of FDR. One of FDR's sons took issue with the doctor in a failed effort to cover-up his father's failing health. Much to his credit, Dr. Wold stood by his analysis. Even in the last few years, there has been an expose of how well FDR's doctor (Ross McIntyre) covered-up from the public, his patient's health.Of course, new information has emerged in the last 8 years concerning Presidents Lincoln, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, and FDR. But, Dr. Wold's book remains a ""gold mine"" of information concisely written."
