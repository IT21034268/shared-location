1,Don t waste your money on this,It s just a printout of man pages. Even that is not organized properly. I returned the book. Buy naba Brkakati's book instead
1,"hmm... where is ""mount""?","Here is just one experience I've had with the book (you be the judge):Looking for the ""mount command"", the index refers you to page 27.Page 27 contains the following line:If you want to ""mount a disk""...Use this Linux command: ""mount"".But is the ""mount"" command in the book? NOPE!If mount was an obscure command I could understand it not being in the book. Not including it though, is like leaving the ""meat"" section out of a cookbook on grilling!This book is woefully incomplete. Save your money!"
1,"Don&#65533;t buy this book. If you already bought it, get rid of it","Page viii: ""Think of this book as you would think of a dictionary...""For obvious reasons, a dictionary arranges words in alphabetical order. For some bizarre reason the authors of this ""dictionary"" chose to arrange the ""words"" by category. This renders the book almost useless. There is a complete alphabetical list of commands - not in the back where it is easily accessible, but in chapter 4! Even this list only narrows your search to a chapter.This book does have a few nice features. For example, Chapter 1, ""Linux Structures and Commands"" and Chapter 4, ""Linux/DOS Cross Reference"" are good for those that need them. However, these benefits are far outweighed by the negatives, and are certainly not the main point of the book.Final recommendation: Don't buy this book. If you already bought it, get rid of it. Every effort to use this book has resulted in complete frustration."
2,Okay for teacher of community college students.,"I ordered the book for my job. My company builds CBT's (computer based training modules) The summary on this book is misleading. The only people that could truly benefit from this book are those that teach GED classes, community college classes, and maybe at universities. The book is extremely dry. The author used words that I had never heard of, and could write pages and pages but say nothing. The author could've fit all of the important info in the book into about 50 pages. I really felt like I wasted my time reading it."
4,Brings back memories,"I was after this CD for Ronnie Spector's version of Billy Joel's Say Goodbye to Hollywood, but there's a lot of great stuff on this CD. While many of the songs are easily found & somewhat well known (I Don't Wanna Go Home, Paradise By The Dashboard Light, Cleveland Rocks), several others were long-lost songs (There's No Surf In Cleveland, Have a Good Time) that got a fair amount of play on Cleveland AOR stations back in the day. It was also hilarious to hear the Rovers Wasn't That A Party again. The balance of the cuts were right out of the late 70's/early 80's; some good, some not so good."
4,Plug it in and it works,"This is the simplest, easiest to use networking technology ever. You plug in two of these little jobbies and connect up the ethernet cables and they just work. I networked by parents remotely with these. I use these at home. I haven't bothered to measure the speed because they are a great improvement over the wireless setup I used to go from my office to my living room.I use this model at home, and other companies' models elsewhere--they've all worked."
5,Excellent reference book!!,"Even if you are new to NT, this book will guide you to all that you need and more. If you have never worked with NT's interface, they give you a 120 eval CD so you can work with it and tweak it any way you want which. You definetly will and can use this book in the real world!!!"
5,"The best collection of Paul Kelly, solo performance, ex'lent",This album is truly representative of Paul Kelly at his best. It is THE album to buy if you are going to own only one of his albums.Exellent album!!
1,Loud buzzing,"This product does work, but uses poor quality cabling and creates a very noticeable buzz on both the speakers and headphones, which I cannot put up with."
4,Plantronics PC Headset Speaker Switch,"Easy to hook up and works fine. Very light weight. Would benefit from some way to attach it to something with Velcro or similar. No way this device will stay in one place unless secured. The rubber feet on the bottom are - well, inadequate."
2,"Works, but very noisy","It works, and I still use it, but it creates a constant buzz from both my speakers and headphones, interspersed with frequent high-pitched squeals like it's haunted by the ghost of someone who died a horrifically painful death."
3,Great Idea,"I love this product because of the ability to switch from speakers to headset without plugging cords in and out.Pros: No plugging and unpluggingCons: No upgrade-ability to 5.1 audio. The build quality is cheap. Sure, it's just a switch in there, but that means the footprint could be less with higher quality plastics, rubber feet (to prevent it from sliding around)."
3,As Advertised,"Worked as advertised. I haven't used it much, we just don't need this item any more, so I gave it away."
3,No mic!,"There is only 1 mic input and that is tied to the headset switch, so if you have it set to speakers there is no mic available. It works fine when using a headset, but not possible to use speakers and a mic. Limiting design!"
1,Noise leaks over from other output,"I had this device switching between my Sonos device and Bose headphones. Regardless of whether the device is connected to any input, if I'm switched into the headphones, there's a very noticeable noise coming out of the headphones. If I unplug the Sonos from the other input (which should be switched off), that noise goes away.I don't know whether to 'blame' this switch of the Sonos input line, but at the end of the day the device should be resistant to letting any noise on either output leak into the other output, so thus the one star review."
4,Works perfectly!,"Simple and straight forward, this speaker headset switch lives up to its description. My only ""gripe"" about this switch is that I wish it had the outlet for an extra mic so if I wanted to switch from my headset to a speaker/desk mic combo..."
2,Alternate way that is better,"This seemed like what I was looking for, to go from PC speakers (sound only), to headset and microphone on Skype, without having to un-plug the speakers, and plug-in the headset each time.I was disappointed to read here that the Plantronics switch is cheap, and not stereo.Alternate way that is better (because it's stereo, and you don't have to flip a switch): Get a couple of these, at $6.99 each (see 2 pics), then you will have two stereo outputs, and two stereo mic inputs (I only use one stereo mic input though, for the headset) ...RadioShack Goldseries, 42-25704"", Stereo, Headphone Cable Y-AdapterFor connecting two sets of headphones to one audio sourceAccepts two 1/8"" stereo phone plugs"
1,Amazingly huge flaw,Mutes mic plugged into switch when you switch from headset to speakers. Huge design flaw. Why? It makes no sense. There's no reason it should do that. Totally limits the amount of uses you can use this for. That alone makes this a horrible buy. Only plus is it's a very durable piece of hardware. Meaning I'll be regretting this buy for years to come or till I get fed up and replace it with some insight in the design.
2,No Stereo,"I purchased the said item and it was a gift from above. I could play games with the headset, then listen to music through the speakers.Then I realised that it eliminates Stereo sound.This means that I don't know if that bad guy is coming from the left or the right of me.Not very useful at all.It is now unplugged, and i'm back with headset only."
1,Technical Information Error,"This product does not include any Technical information on how the product works, and therefore it is not known to normal customers(like myself) that this product Does NOT support my speaker setup. The product has ONE speaker jack, and my speaker setup has 3. As far as I know, only the most expenseless speakers have only 1 speaker jack. ANNOYING"
5,NOT FOR COMPUTERS ONLY!,"This device can also be used with any audio unit (for example, a portable CD player) that has a mini-plug output jack--enabling you to switch from headphones to, say, amplified speakers, without the aggravating ritual of removing one plug from the playback unit and inserting the other (and wearing out the jack in the process); and at the computer, it can be used for instantly switching from those typically weak (but often useful) built-in monitor speakers to more powerful desktop speakers, as source material and circumstances demand. (Of course, you'll need one switch for each such arrangement.) A marvelously simple and simply marvelous device, with more uses than Plantronics chooses to advertise."
3,Good for the average consumer,"I have found that any time I plug my headset directly to my computer I get 100 percent loss-less sound. When I use my headset through the Plantronics switch I hear a faint buzzing or interference for my sound, for me as a gamer I find the loss in sound quality unacceptable...so I have resigned to leave this product disconnected from my computer."
5,a must have,"If you want to bounce back-n-forth between your head phones and desktop speakers with a simple toggle switch, this is a must have. Cheap and easy!"
2,Chart = Dates BUT Exam = Trends,"Unlike the European History SparkChart, this SparkChart covers dates and dates only. Since the exam focuses more on eras and trends than specific dates, reviewing this chart is almost a waste of time.Though I did score a 5 on the exam, it was in spite of - not because of - wasting my money on this chart."
2,Should have stayed in the land down under...,"Guido Hatzis' ""Do Not Talk Over Me"" was hilarious from start to finish but this effort for the most part falls short. On this album a lot of the Americans are caught off guard by Guido's accent and can't understand half of what he's saying anyway. Pass on this one unless you get an opportunity to buy it at a very low cost. ""Do Not Talk Over Me"" still puts every prank phone call album to shame as it is nothing short of brilliant, ""Deported"" just couldn't be expected to follow up."
5,An excellent book of tales,This is an anthology of 19 fairy tales from North American Indian culture that have been collected and retold by the author.I. Micabo's IslandII. Ugly ThingIII.

4,Yin &Yang: Understanding the Chinese Philosophy of Opposites,"Simply put, this is an elegant treatment of the depth and practicality of Chinese Philosophy. In Yin & Yang the author moves us beyond the obvious male/female,dark/light polarities and gracefully helps us transform our personal / political paradigms."
5,Great product,"This fit in my cart perfectly, easy to install and cheap. Also shipped quickly. Good buy and will happily recommend."
5,Beautiful story,"A lesson for all people of all ages...that interracial friendships are neither impossible nor implausible. It is a little too intense for very young readers, nor will they fully be able to understand the story behind the two main characters. Pinkus Aylee is exceptionally powerfully portrayed, in that he is fighting against slavery but does not let this impede his friendship with a white boy. He was fighting the INSTITUTION, not the INDIVIDUAL. It is also notable that until he met Pink, Sheldon Curtis, an Ohio boy, had never even seen a person of color or knew what slavery was. Very telling for everyone who thinks the Civil War was fought over slavery alone. Sheldon Curtis would not let his friend Pink be forgotten; let his memory go on in this age frought with race-consciousness."
5,I love this fine book so much I read it to my grandparents .,"I liked the idea of this book. The main idea of the book was to tell the story of two young boys , one white and one black who were complete strangers and how they became great friends during the American Civil War. The white boy's name was Sheldon Russell Curtis or Say and the black boy's name was Pinkus Aylee or Pink. Say was wounded and left for dead on a field, Pink had been separated from his company and found Say. Pink dragged Say to his mother's houser or Moe Moe Bay's house were she took care of them. She became attached to Say and cried when the boys packed to go back to the war. Right before they left marauders came and shot Moe Moe Bay, you'll have to read the book to hear the sad end."
3,Pretty good,"I liked this book. It was about the Civil War. Pink and Say are two boys whose names were Pinkus and Sheldon. Pink found Say lying on the ground after he had been shot by the Confederate Army because he had escaped from military camp. They became friends and they were put in different troops. At the end, they were with each other. I think second and third graders would like to read it. This book did have some sad parts."
1,Not a children's book!,"This is really a fine and interesting story, but it is certainly not appropriate for children. It has the look of a children's book, but the ending is horrible and not something appropriate for elementary children. Two of the three main characters die brutally (someone dead and bloody lying on the ground is not what I expect to see in a picture book). Unfortunately the format makes it unlikely that it will be read by the audience it is most appropriate for (I'd say at least middle school and up) as most people are not looking to buy picture books for that age group."
3,Pink and Say,Triston Corriveau 3-13-07Writing Book ReviewThe book Pink and Say is a bout tow boys that go to war .It takes place in the south during the civil war. Say got shot in the leg pink carried him to his moms house. She took care of him. They had to hide because the other soldier where coming to find them. Pinks mom got shot by the other soldiers that where looking for Pink and Say. A man from the war comes to tell them they have to go back. They go back in their uniforms and they are soldiers again.I thought Pink and Say was a good book. It made me feel like what they felt like. It made me think of my uncle because he going to college for the Air Force. And I want to be in the Air Force.
4,Great for so many ages,"Pink and Say is a wonderful book for children of all ages. It can be used when introducing the civil war, teaching about slavery, tolerance, or just about friendship. Though it is a picture book, even older students will love it. The illustrations bring to life the story. There are so many discussions a class can have through out the story. It is a heartbreaking story of two young boys in the Civil War. It shows just how desperate the troups were during the war. Though they were to only carry the staff or such, the boys were forced to fight when so many men died. Children can see how slavery, and the Civil War affected children. This story allows children to see how wars and the ways of adults do affect them. Though it is a sad story it is one of great heart. I hope all teachers read this to their students."
5,Amazing story!,This war time story will warm your heart...make you laugh and cry. This author has 4 books on my personal top ten list. You won't be disappointed!
4,Tear Jerker!,No one told me that this book was going to make me cry! I love this author and how she writes about true events. Very good book! Must read it to your children!
5,I love it but too short,I love this book because it is great. It talks about a black person and a white person helping each other. They don't care what color they are as long as they are friends. They help each other and share stuff about each other. This is one of the best books in the world because it is very nice. I recommend this book to you.
3,Not As It Seems,"This was A great book but it is supposed to be a childerens book (ages 4-6) but this book was not at all for little childeren. I'm a babysitter and I got this book from the library and read it to the kids I baby sit and in the middle I just put it down because I was afraid of giveing them nightmares. Although, in my eighth grade history class my teacher did read it to us and it was very educational. I do recommend this book if your a history teacher, but if your a parent I do not at all recommend that you read this to your childeren"
4,Read This Book!,"Pink and Say is a great book. Our social studies teacher read it to us one day and every one was disturbed. I'm pretty sure every one felt so horrible for Say. Patricia Polacco is so very talented. The illustrations are so good. You can make them real in your mind. This book brings out the joyous moments and the sad ones. If I was her, I would be so proud of this book. Anyone who would read this would want to read this book again."
5,Excellent introduction for beginners ...,But be aware it is for you only if you are an Arcitecht... if you use autocad for other reasons I think you should consider another one..
5,Excellent book for beginners,I bought this book to use as a textbook for a Beginning AutoCAD 14 internet class. I was on my own in learning and this book was just great. My intructor was amazed at how fast I was learning to draw. I highly recomend this book to any new users.
4,This is a great book if you know nothing!,"This is great for those who have never ventured into AutoCAD and need to start learning. I bought the book because I was starting an internship at an architecture firm and needed to get basics down so that I would be of more use. I have begun working through the tutorial and have picked up enough so that I am pretty comfortable using the application. The project managers in the office were so impressed with the book, and the results they see in me, they're planning on buying it for themselves!"
3,"Great perfume,inferior packaging","The fragrance is great but I was very surprised how shoddy the packaging was for this product. The metal collar on the bottle is cheap looking, sharp and rattles,moves and distracts from the bottle. The designer should eliminate it as it does not enhance the product at all."
3,Not really that much of a story but written well so it held my interest,"This is a 1945 novel. Its about a peaceful period in the American past and was a pleasant read. It's a story about a young Baptist minister in the south, his family life ans struggles with church politics. Again this novel was a pleasant peaceful read but not particularly exciting or educai-tonal."
4,Great 'high priced' product,Very disappointed that Maybelline discontinued this shade. The seller was extremely prompt with this great but 'high priced' product. 5 stars for seller and quality of product but 0 stars for Maybelline.
5,Only place to find them,I have been buying these eyebrow pencils for the last 5 or 6 years online due to the factthat the charcoal gray is not available in stores anymore. You now have to pay alot more for them. I have tried some other brands on the market and none of them can compare with the Maybelline eyebrow pencils. Great eyebrow pencil but the price has more than doubled. I will continue searching for them and may have to bite the bullet and pay this outrageously high price or just give up and try another different color from Maybelline.
4,maybelline pencils,"I received my pencils in a timely manner. I find that in trying to sharpen them, that they sharpen dis-evenly , and sometimes the point just falls off when I line my eyes, causing a lot of waste, because it takes a lot off the pencil to re-sharpen it."
5,finally found what I wanted,Difficult to find these anymore and in the color I wanted...after using the same product for so many years....it was a great find!
1,"they cost way to much 2 pencils for 20.00. They must have been old , they broke",The pencils cost way to much at 10.00 a piece. The pencils broke and broke when i tried to sharpen them. They must have been old.
1,"I need to know how ""2"" eyebrow pencils could cost $15.00??????","Please let me know, I would really like to order charcoal grey eyebrow pencils. Would order by the dozens, but when did they get so expensive? Please respond.Thank You Marcia"
1,"very cheap so bought it,later found d quality is also cheap lik its price","saw great reviews over here,was planning 2 buy it,but it got delayed.just yesterday ws goin 2 a party,so went 2 store as my eyeliner ran off.Was very excited to find this.Came home and tried,goshh,realised why they discontinued this product.It was not even spreading and i hav been using only pencil eyeliners since past 7years!!!blive me u dnt wana buy this cheapster ever!!!!"
3,Charcoal Grey Expert Eyes Pencils,Product arrived quickly and is ok considering it is a discontinued item. Pencils seemdried out and the tip breaks easily. I guess it's old. Can't imagine why Maybelline woulddiscontinue this product since there are so many of us with grey hair!
5,Maybelline Expert Eyes Twin Brow & Eye Pencils - Charcoal Grey,"Why is it impossible to find this product anymore, I don't want black pencils I want this lighter colour? Oh well too bad I have to order this but it is a great product for the colour"
2,I CAN'T BELIVE I DID THIS,"I CAN'T BELIVE WHAT I HAD TO PAY FOR TWO EYE BROW PENCILS, THEY STOP SELLING THE MOST POPULAR COLOR. SO WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY SUCH AN EXPENSIVE PRICE FOR THE PRODUCT AND THEN THEY SHIP THE MOST EXPENSIVE WAY. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO (IF IT FITS IT SHIPS). PUT 2 SMALL PENCILS IN A ENVELOPE AND MAIL IT TO ME!!! NOPE THAT IS TO MUCH LIKE RIGHT.FROM A PERSON WHO LEARNED A LESSON"
5,The Five Love Languages for Singles,This is an excellent book and I would recommend this to anyone. It really opens up your eyes on relationships and how they should work. I think that everyone should read this before getting married!!!
5,A must read!,"I learned about ""The Five Love Languages"" from a former coworker who found it incredibly helpful in his marriage. Not being married myself, I purchased this version for singles.I have recommed this book (or the original) to just about everyone I know and a many I don't!The concepts are so simple but yet profound. Understanding the primary love languages of my friends, family and even coworkers has been very helpful and has strengthened our relationships.The only negative feedback I would give is in regards to the Physical Touch chapter... it isn't until then that you truly realize this is a Christian book! I deeply respect Mr. Chapman but think he should know that people have pre-marital sex and it is not a sin! Aside from that, this (or the original) is a MUST READ!!!"
2,Another relationship book skimming the surface,"I liked this book a lot, but it's yet another one that gives the impression that you can fix relationships by simply applying rules that you learn. It doesn't really get into the driving forces of what gets people into the relationship situations that they find themselves in before they start reading it - and these are always subconscious drivers that need to be understood and learned patterns and responses changed. Otherwise, all you do is try to apply things that are foreign to you, and in the long run that cannot work and isn't realistic. TryFit for Love: Find Your Self and Your Perfect Mate, and then read this. I found that the two in tandem work well, but you need both."
4,Helpful in all realtionships,"I've heard about this book for quite some time now, but after reading it I consider myself a better ""lover"". Not only was I able to analyze my own love language, I'm better equipped to love those around me and understand their love language as well. It really is amazing how differently we express and receive love. I strongly recommend this to anyone especially newly engaged couples."
5,Great advice and insight!!!! Every woman should read!,"This is a great book with good advice. My daughters both read it also and it should help them make much wiser decisions. It's not just ""luck"" to get the right one...it's knowing what to look for and sticking to the ""standards"". Thanks to Steve Harvey!"
5,This is a great book,I am enjoying this book a great deal and it feels like the book is written just for me. Everything the books talks about and describes makes me think so much harder about my past and how come i didn't notice that sign or pick up on that. So this book is simple amazing and i recommend anyone who wants to change the way they look at relationships and to improve upon them get the book. In general it is a great read as well.
5,The Five Love Languages Singles Edition,"I found this book helped me to understand a lot more about my past, and what I need to do now to have a happier future. I was able to learn so much about love. It changed the way I see people in a big way. I would recommend this book to any single."
5,Five Love Languages-book,"So far, every time I order through Amazon, I have been pleased. The book, The Five Love Languages for Singles, was/is in excellant shape and was received right on time! Thank YOU!!!"
1,boring,I find this book to be boring and long winded. They could have listed the five languages of lone on two sheets of paper and had all the use full info.
4,Great,I purchased this book for our single's ministry group. We are learnig a lot from this book. I suggest anyone that is single and looking to date and want to make good dating decisions to read this book.
5,Great Book,I've read this and would suggest it to anyone that enjoys self improvement books. It's an easy read and relatable for all.
5,Wonderful!,This book is absolutely wonderful! I only have 20 minutes of ssr time but every time I begin to read I cannot put it down. It is very insightful and I look forward to being able to apply these principles into my next relationship!
4,Better than science.,Quick and easy reading. Filled with examples on how to sucessfully analysis others so you can express your love for them in a language they will appreciate. You too will learn your language of love and I found this answered many of my questions on how to better the relationships I have with others.
4,Helpful book,"Here is a practical approach to connect more easily with singles by determining whether they have a preference for being helped (acts of service), whether gifts appeal to them the most, whether touch is of primary importance, or whether they respond more strongly to their other senses being stimulated. I think the approach is credible, valid, and practical. I found the book helpful."
5,Love the book,Loved this book. Makes a lot of since and if you pay attention to people you'll see a difference IF you apply the logic from the book.
5,Wish I'd had this information years ago.,"This book makes so much sense. Had I known these things years ago, I could have spared myself some major mistakes. I have given copies of the original Five Love Languages to every married couple I love, and I recommend these books to anyone I hear mentioning relationship troubles."
4,Love language is a great reference book,As a retreat facilitator I am always looking for books to add to our library for both singles and couples. I found the couples kit by Gary Chapman and like it so I decided to purchase this book. This edition deals with how to communicate with anyone and offers tools and advice that anyone can use and understand.
5,Worth your time !,"Gives insight on relating to individuals on their level, thru their ""love language"". We are not all created the same, and this book provides tools which can enhance our communication with each other."
2,Mediocre,"Okay first of all, I read this entire book in about 3 hours. This was part of a study we were doing at a bible study group; and I have to say I'm cynical about this book even from a Christian's perspective.First, take a look at the cover. See those ridiculously happy nicely dressed perfect looking people? Well if you're not one of them, this book isn't for you. It's full of superficial and contrived mini-stories. To methey just don't seem to fit in with real life situations that people have with all the hurting and complicated lives we go through. The stories remind me of those how-to educational films from the 40'sThe basic message of the book is this: learn what makes people in your life feel loved, follow the golden rule, etc. etc. It's pretty much intuition. I don't think however that it will lead to some miraculous change in how you deal with people nor will it do anything to help you establish new relationships."
5,"The five love languages,,,,","This is a book, everyone should read. It has opened my eyes several years ago. Since then, I bought several copies and gave them to people in need. All I ever got back from them was, thank you , thank you, thank you for allowing me to discover myself, and my partner. When it comes to relationships, and understanding people, this is the book that will keep on giving.I hope it will be a blessing for you to :-)"
5,Really Good Book,I honestly learned a lot from this book...didn't realize that love languages were important with your family and friends...wish I discovered it earlier...MUST READ!!!
5,easy to read,"The five love languages as primary language, gift, work service, quantity time,,physical touch,that was all real useful. Just for singles."
1,What a Lemon,This is a true lemon.It does not hold the cold for more 10 minutes.It very clumsy do deal with.Luiz
5,Glorious HD transfer and bonus material must have,"Whereas years ago a Best Of music videos DVD was issued in english, this product offers videos in spanish/2 in spanglish. The video images are extremely vibrant and crisp. The ill-fated LIFE Dual CD Disc w/dvd footage that was canceled by Sony previously, as well as the Almas DelSilencio featurette top off this release with behind the scenes footage and Ricky at work, play and exercise, showcasing his beefcake waist-stripped photo shoots. The discography for all his albums and their track listings is a nice feature. It takes a bit to get used to the menu option to forward/back-up individual videos to play, and there is no ""All"" option.Ricky's dynamic use of either his native language, english, or spanglish, does not diminish the dance/soul urge you feel when his music fills your ears. You can't help but feel emotion when his sound enages your senses."
5,Ricky Martin 17 years 17 songs,"As a Ricky fan, I love this compilation CD. It has a variety of his biggest hits to celebrate his solo career of 17 years. I never tire of his voice on these classic ballads like Vuelve and no one can sit still during the high energy Latin dance songs, like La Bomba. Whether you are a loyal fan who wants to have every Ricky CD or someone who is just checking out his music for the first time, you will love this excellent CD!"
1,The video is Good but....,"There is nothing wrong with ricky or his video, it is all about the DVD format or the programming, it really sucks, the worst in 21st century, ever.....You can't skip to the next video, you must wait until the existing video to play until the end, then it jumps into the menu selection, then only you can select the video you wanna see next manually...."
1,Let's start the class action suit!,"I finished the DVD in 5 min. Bandai, this is a total disgrace. I can undestand if we are in Japan and the production is running slow on the weekly program and these episode are padded in. Or 1-2 episodes are used to add more info with recap. But to inlude these in the US release is just shameful! IF YOU ALREADY OWN DISC 1-3 (I assume you do, otherwise you would not be interested in this one?), save your money and proceed to disc 5!"
1,LAME!!!! I'm so glad i borrowed my friends copy,"So i finish disc 3, pop in disc 4 ready for more action...suddenly i'm watching disc 1 again. except disc 1 is in its case.there was no reason to even have this so called recollection disc. real lame now i gotta wait for disc 5 to arrive in the mail."
2,Buy This One Last,"Ok, I like this series, buy honestly, it did not need four recap episodes in a row. The naration doesn't give any new insightsor reveal anything about the plot. If I had known that I would have bought this disk last, if at all."
1,Vol. 4 IS extinct.....,"What happened? Instead of continuing on with this fantastic series, the animators decided to use one whole DVD volume to recap all events up to this point. Did someone in the production team realize that the series was going to be one DVD short in filling up the box set & they decided to remedy that?Get Vol. 4 ONLY if you have short term memory issues or like looooooooong flashbacks. Otherwise skip to Volume 5, you'll be glad you did."
1,Feeling totally ripped off!,Absolutely no excuse for this DVD except to rip off fans of this anime. Save your money and avoid Volume 4!
2,Let's just say I'm glad I saved some $$,"Well, This dvd is pretty bad, like everyone else said. It's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14, with narration from each character in the background. I believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they weren't getting high ratings on the anime series. Anyway, I didn't buy this dvd, because I have the japanese box set instead, which saved me a lot of $$. I watched each episode, and I must say the only part I liked was the opening and ending theme. Other than that, there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die-hard wolf's rain fan. But, don't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window. I really highly recommend renting this before you buy it, cause otherwise you are wasting your money."
2,It's a recap disc.,"The episodes on this disc are 'recap' episodes, summarising the the contents of the previous three discs. There is little or no new content here. This is because Bones, the Japanese studio making the show, was running out of money, so they needed to do some low budget episodes using already-made video. Thus the four recap episodes were inserted into the series. Also note that volume 5 is being released only three weeks after this one, as opposed to the customary two months for Bandai titles."
5,Cheerful Baby and The Music for Babies Series,"Review from Pregnancy Buyer's Guide.The new Music for Babies series from ABT is something I will recommend to everyone I know!I was so thrilled to hear well-known classical pieces, traditional folk melodies and nursery rhymes played by classically-trained musicians on ""real"" acoustic instruments.The choice of instrumentation is perfect for Baby's ears, and all selections are beautifully-arranged so that you will actually like listenign to them as well.I can't say enough about this wonderful CD series!"
5,recommended by mom with an out-of-sync kid,"Our occupational therapist recommended these Advanced Brain cds for our son with (mild) sensory processing disorder. We play this cd when the little man wakes up in the morning and from napping, and it has made all of the difference. He is happier, and doesn't lose his temper, or melt down quite as easily. I am talking about extremely regular and consistent playing, but it really seems to be working. I don't know how or why it is making him a happier kid, I just know that he is."
5,I really like this CD.,I really like this CD. The music is great for infants - cheerful but not over-stimulating. Good purchase.
4,Happy tunes,"I bought this as gift for a friend's baby. Was told by the baby's Mom,that the music was beautiful. She, Daddy, and baby are very happy with this gift!!!"
1,Does not fit well,"The Putnam underbed goose install for chevy/gmc trucks does not fit well. Holes in brackets do not align with holes in truck frame, L-brackets do not fit where they should on top of truck frame and bend truck bed. Very disappointed with this entire system."
5,Great for Newbies and Veterans,I think this is the best book for someone whose about to replace an NT server with a Linux box. The added bonus is if you're sharing Samba with Netatalk or NFS. Great tips for how to make 'em all coexist.I hope a version covering the 2.2 Samba series comes out soon!
2,THIS IS NOT A WORKOUT DVD*!!,"If you have absolutely NO knowledge on how to hit a heavy bag than you shouldn't even be using one. This brief dvd will NOT educate you on the proper way to hit a bag. Just different combinations that even the most clueless to this sport would know.. The jab cross combos ETC. It does not provide you with even ONE ten minute work-out routine. It's just one hour of this man talking, basically. To return it isnt even worth the money I would get back after I paid for shipping.I give it 2 stars only because it educated you on how to adjust your speed-bag platforms and make changes so you can have the proper rhyme.. IE. adding a wood panel the same circumferance on top of the platform and drilling through.. I suggest you keep looking."
5,Buzz Froward and Space Boy,"The album is a pleasure to listen to and breaks away from the ""ordinary"" music."
4,"Works for Acura Integra Front Ball joints,...","I primarily work on my two Hondas (Acura Integra, and Honda S2000) and took a chance and purchased this product with no prior reviews. Thus far I've only had a chance to try it out on the front upper ball joints of my Acura Integra and I'm happy to report that it works as described. Hopefully those of you that see this will be less hesitant to buy it for working on a vehicle similar to mine."
1,does not work for honda civic 2001 lower ball joint,The tool is average. The quality is questionable. The upper 2 fork pieces broke when trying to pop out the ball joint. Will not seat well on all car applications.
3,Ball Joint Lifter's thumb is too big,"The ""thumb"" portion of this tool is very husky. There isn't enough clearance above the ball joint stub for me to slide the tool in place. I'll need to try to find a meeker tool with thinner parts. So I don't know if the tool works well or not."
1,this sucked,the spindle that holds the fork and lifter together broke the moment i started to use it. so i had to use an old steel drill bit to replace it. as i cranked it the lower lift arm broke in half. really disappointing. oh well it was only a 20 dollar loss. i used it on a ball joint so if your wanting to use this dont but this. it may slightly decent for the tie rod but for sure it will not have any use for the ball joint.
4,Adequate Tool For The Job,"I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this tool, because it looked to be too bulky for my 1997 Honda CR-V's lower ball joints. It actually worked pretty well with a couple modifications to its usage. First, contrary to the instructions, I used a hex nut on the end of the ball joint stem, being sure to seat the nut flush with the end of the stem (instructions say to leave the castle nut in place, but it seemed too tall - may be different on your particular vehicle). Second, the forked portion of the tool wouldn't fit all the way under the ball joint boot at first, so I applied a little grease to the fork so that I could gradually slide it under the boot as I turned the tool's bolt to separate the ball joint from the lower arm. Done.All in all, this tool was a good value for its application.Caution: Do not hammer aggressively on the tool to force the fork under the ball joint boot; you risk tearing the ball joint boot by doing so."
1,"Broke on first use, cheap material","One of the fork tines snapped off with minimal force applied, consider this a single use tool. Not worth the money."
2,For the money,"it can't be beat. However, as another reviewer mentioned, the thumb is too large and doesn't fit ball joints with longer threads. The fork also broke after a few uses, so this really isn't a quality alternative to the pricier option. This should be fine if you're doing a couple ball joints. But for frequent use, pay the extra money and get something that'll last."
2,It broke,"The hinge pin sits loosely in the tool and will bend and snap. I snapped the hinge using a small 5"" ratchet and minimal effort. The arm I was trying to separate was nowhere close to coming off. Also, if you are working on a smaller car, be aware that the forked part of the tool can be too bulky to fit between the arm and the boot. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because you can replace the hinge pin easily if you really need to keep this cheap tool."
2,F. F. Bruce's New Testament Documents: Is This Edition Reliable?,This was the most poorly printed text I have ever purchased from Amazon. Almost every page contained gross printing errors that made the work difficult to read. The print job must have been outsourced to Lower Slobovia.
1,Great book: Terrible publication,"This book (in general, not from Wilder Publication) is one that a person who is getting involved with defending the Biblical manuscript texts is one of the best. Unfortunately, the image of this book has been smeared by this AWFUL rendition from Wilder Publications. During this review, I am currently not finished with the book and I still have found countless errors-most of which could have been handled by brief proofreading. It is unfortunate that the late F.F. Bruce's book could have had such a great book put in such a terrible way. I am appalled by this book, and disgusted with Wilder Publications. Shame on them."
3,Good book but to many mis-spelled words,"The book is very interesting. I would rate it higher but there are so many mis-spelled words in it. I like the book but when I read it, the words that are spelled wrong are very distracting. Looks like someone could have proofread it before printing it and used spell check."
2,Worst. Editing. Ever.,I had to stop reading this because the editing was so poor. It was evident that a previous manuscript was sent through a scanner and the results were sent to print without review. At page 13 I had already caught 4 errors. Terrible. Find any other copy than the 2009 Wilder edition.
4,Solid Scholarship,"As most reviewers' have already commented on the scholarship attributes of the book, which I generally agree with, I will focus my comments on the publisher, Wilder Publications, LLC (2009). This is by far the poorest book I have ever tried to read in regard to the printing accuracy -- it is literally full of typeset errors. It is so bad in certain areas that it is difficult if not impossible to make sense of what is written. So if you desire to purchase this book, please try to get an older version from a different publisher, even if you have to buy it used. My rating of the book is out of respect for the author but in no way reflects my satisfaction with the publisher. I would not have bought the book if I had known the publishing was so poor."
4,"In your face, deconstructionists!","Bruce is a world class scholar, yet his work is accessible to the masses. Fairly short book, but packed with a lot of information as to why the New Testament documents should a priori be considered as historical, though not necessarily inspired."
1,disaster,Bruce's original is excellent but this latest version is a disaster. Do not purchase the Wilder edition of this work. Whatever system Wilder employed to re-fit the text was not adequate. The book is full of errors.
2,Poor publishing,"I ordered this book for an Apologetics class I am taking in seminary. I was very disappointed to find out that the publisher had apparently made no attempts to proofread the text before publishing it. The book is fraught with printing errors with severely detract from the reading of this classic work. F. F. Bruce is a masterful writer, but this edition of his work does not do him justice."
3,Typos,"This is just a comment on the quality of the Kindle Edition. I've only just begun the book, but I've found the many typos frustrating. I still haven't figured out what year is meant by ""AD a7.1"", in the third chapter. It seems clear the text was scanned in and never proofread by a human."
3,Who edited this edition? DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE EDITION,"It is difficult to give this book a poor review, which I purchased on Kindle format, since I am familiar with F. F. Bruce's work and I know that his material is very good.My complain is on the shameful editing of the book. This seems to be the complain even among some of the four star ratings that I read which is unfortunate since we are rating the product as a whole and I believe that editing is very important.The book contains many errors which made the reading of this book an unpleasant experience. Below I list a few of these errors:1) Punctuation missing where there should be some or added where there should be none.2) Added words to sentences or missing words.3) Misspellings throughout the entire book. The most memorable one for me at this time is ""m"" for the word ""in"".I recommend the book, just not this Kindle edition.Soli Deo Gloria1"
3,They're More Reliable than the Proofing for this Kindle Edition,"My review is a review of the Kindle edition of Bruce's 6-star book. I'm currently working on a doctorate and have a large stack of books. So, the appeal of having this text in an e-book is incredible. This edition, however, was not ""ready for prime time"". I appreciate the effort in getting this book into an electronic format, and I really do use it, but F. F. Bruce might not be very flattered."
4,Want Proof?,"Don't let the title fool you! Mr. Bruce's motive is to prove beyond a shadow of doubt of the validity of the New Testament scriptures; he does drive his point home. He did an outstanding job in uncovering many sources that the above average student of the Word could even begin to find. He covers the four Gospels with stuning detail( even their dates of writing) as well as an overveiw of the various epistles. He also discusses the canon of scriptures. What I found to be the most helpful was his covering various writings by the early church fathers, Jewish literature, and even some rather interesting gentile(pagan) writings. Purchase this book and be prepared for some interesting reading. Go with God."
3,Decent but messy,"I have not made it beyond page 11 and am already extremely frustrated with the amount of typos, misspellings and incorrect punctuation. Although the material itself appears scholarly and well-researched, this particular edition is so full of mistakes that I find it very difficult to take anything within its content seriously. As a Biblical scholar and youth pastor I was hoping to add this book to the reading list for my youth group. However, I must seek out a different edition which contains fewer mistakes, otherwise I could not take myself seriously as a legitimate English reader. Perhaps, buried within the misspellings, random numbers, incorrect punctuation and random paragraphs, there is important information. Unfortunately, I am too overwhelmed by the shoddiness of this edition to give any credence to the presented facts. I am unable to follow any of his arguments because I keep getting distracted by the poor publication."
5,Excellent in Substance and Style,F.F. Bruce was a top notch scholar whose love of Scripture comes through clearly in his writing. This book is an excellent and readable resource for learning about the history of the Bible we now read.A good source for understanding why the Da Vinci Code is so incorrect.
2,Not her best work,Some of her earlier work (1966) and certainly not her best. The stories themselves wander aimlessly lost among unformed and unrefined characters. Convoluted plot lines that twist back upon themselves with no development or direction. The Hainish connection is not enough to join the three works in any meaningful manner. A disappointment from an author whose later works among the best. Useful only as a study of her development and growth as a storyteller.
5,Too cute!!!,"I recently bought this set for my baby boys nursery. It is totally adorable!! I, of course, washed the sheet, comforter, bumper, dust ruffle, and headboard before I put them on the crib. They didn't fade or shrink a bit. The characters on the mobile are SUPER SOFT, as are the ones on the headboard!! All of the other pieces are great, too! The lamp, the door pillow, the hanging wall pic's... I was a little nervous about the price being a reflection of the quality of the fabric, but I couldn't have been more wrong! For the money, you cannot beat this nursery in a bag!! So far, I cannot find a single thing wrong with this set, and I think that it is PERFECT!!!"
4,Informative,I found this to be a very good summary and overview of the history of the Episcopal Church. I learned more about how the church was formed and developed than from other history books of the Episcopal Church.
1,Camera no longer being sold,"I recently bought this camera and found it to be very easy to use. It also takes great pictures. However, I have since found out that this model has been discontinued. How did I find that out? My dog chewed the camera to PC cord in half. Now I can't download my pictures to my computer to save or send them. I can't find the cord anywhere including on the internet. So now it is a very nice but useless digital camera. Thanks, Fuji, for thinking of the consumer. I won't buy another Fuji product."
2,Autographed Copy,"I purchased a numbered, autographed copy. I think I purchased, say, 1000 or so. . .that being said, I'm sure that is a good number because the first 900 likely went to the band's friends, record executives, etc. Nevertheless, I got Eric Singer's autograph and Bruce Kulicks. . .nothing against them, but KISS' autographs include ONLY Gene, Paul, Ace, and Peter. Period. The book is heavy, glossy, with lots of good photos. . .but if you are thinking about buy a copy now, the ONLY way I'd buy it is if it is autographed by the original members. That being said: stay way. 2 / 5 stars."
3,Knowing what I know now.....,"would I purchase this book? The answer is no. While the original series was autographed (by Bruce and Eric in mine) the stability of the book and the time it took to get the thing both were/are sub-par. When it appeared that the original band would never get back together - this was a very good document to the past. Now, it's nice for pictures, but a lot has chaged in the world of KISS. I would recommend Extreme Close-up or Second Coming as video documents. Much cheaper and about the same content. Pictures can always be found on the web anyway."
4,Very beautyful & a must for any KISS-fan !,"I love this book, it's so heavy and so full of KISS ! Everything you ever wanted to know can be found in it. I got a real kick out of seeing the real signatures of Ace, Paul, Gene & Peter : I've got them a bit more in my home now ! I was lucky to buy it at the concert in Holland (03-13-1999), but otherwise I would have bought it through the Internet ! The only reason why I don't rate the book 5 stars, is the price. OK, it's worth the money, but there should be a cheaper version of the book for the less fortunate KISS fans !!!"
2,Who do they think they are?,"Got this CD for my husband for Christmas. Maybe I did not read the fine print, but I was shocked to find out that this CD is really SHORT, something like 12 minutes? Why whould I pay this much money for one short song? I was really disappointed."
4,Great Item,"Got this as a gift. It's a great item and the biggest bonus is the handy pullout function. I use this mainly when I am coordinating conferences, so having a quick way to see the conference schedule is very helpful. The gray strip on the side make it look a tad less professional but gives it a unique look."
5,Group theory for beginners,"This is simply brilliant. However, it is also different from John Derbyshire's other book ""Prime Obsession"". It is more abstract and I myself had to read in a second time to understand the concepts fully. But what a reward! Once the reader comprehends his deliberation on groups and invariance, he or she can enbark on other journeys in understanding the nature of physics (and by corollary the universe itself). So in summary, it is as clear as it can be, and as engaging as Derbyshire has been."
5,enjoyable history of algebra,"This is a good casual read for those with a passing interest and familiarity with algebra and some higher mathematics. I gained an appreciation for the foundations for many elements of algebra that I had taken for granted. For example, many principles of algegbra are older than I realized, but they were developed without the benefit of the notation we now use. That is, what we easily do by symbolic substitution and rearrangement was developed and practiced entirely in the form of what we now call ""word problems"". The old timers didn't have or use equations as we now know them. To me, that just confirms their genius."
5,Amazing,"I hate how mathmatics is taught in such an anti historical manner; teachers should take a lesson from this book and others that shed so much light and motivation on the subject of mathmatics. This the type of book that makes me want to change my major fron engineeing to mathmatics, and in that respect i hate this book, because its going to make me a poor man one day.Keep it coming Derbyshire!"
1,Poor binding,"Though the subject matter was not what I expected, the real problem was that the pages started falling out as soon as I opened it."
5,fascinating,"The histoey of algebra,as told in this book, is full of very interestig biographies of famous matthematicians.But what is even more interesting is the history of development of human pure thougt.""Cogito ergo sum""."
1,better unknown,"Some people never know when to shut up.What begins with promise degenerates intoa tabloid journalism approach to(mathematical) celebrity along with somenaive political comments straight out ofthe establishment playbook. All this ismoot, however, as the author by this time-and by his own admission - is in so farover his head that he doesn't even under-stand the topics he's trying to cover."
5,Loving Poems that Immerse Us in the Flow of Life,"These poems take us deep down, into glowing river gorges dripping with canyon wren song, still dark pools fed by luminous tears, and that place of inner peace where we feel our measured breaths mingle with the essence of earth and spirit. There's a hopeful resonance in Chris's poetry, a knowledge that through meditation, quiet observation, and loving engagement we can achieve a strengthening bond with the sacred beauty that surrounds us. I take this book on the road with me, read the poems around sunrise and sunset, and feel both comforted and refreshed as I wander into wild places."
4,Good Product,I use this on my face after I shave in the morning. It is soothing and does not sting like some other Aloe products on the market. I would recommend it.
2,Very sticky.,"This gel is very sticky and sweet, also seems not completely absorbed (50% is absorbed and 50% dry on the skin surface and then seems to peel).I had to mix it with other creams, in two equal parts (mix with cream for very dry skin).It also works better if you mix it with drops of essential oil or olive oil. (5 drops of oil per arm or leg, if you still feel sticky or syrupy, to the next (the next day after the bath), repeat the formula but with more oil until you get the desired sensation."
2,Stings,"As many other have said: this product really stings when applied to the face (not sunburned either). I don't track the formulation changes, but this iteration lights my cheeks up something horrible."
3,OK - sticky and too much fragrance,"This is OK - but just that. It's thicker than it should be and has way too much fragrance added to it to the point of being offensive (to me, to you it might be great!). I am also quite sticky after applying it and if my skin gets wet the stickiness returns. Won't be buying again."
5,Good Product,Good price for 16 oz size. Seems like a good product with fewer additives than many aloe gels out there.
2,New formulation is CRAP,"Short review: I have been using this Jason Aloe Gel for years (primarily on my face). And it has been great. Right up until they came out with the ""new bottle, same formulation"" formula. Well, as you can see from some other reviewers--it is anything but the ""same great formula"".The new gel is thicker/tacky/sticky.. almost feels like a runny glue. It is horrid to use.. particularly on the face where it will have strange stuff peel off after it dries. So you kind of look like you're getting a bad sunburn peel.Not sure what other products to recommend [yet]. But the Jason Aloe Gel is a no go for me anymore. It's unfortunate.. seems like Jason did this on a few of their products (apricot scrubble, for example), and they've either cheapened them out or somehow managed to ruin the previously good formulation.Update: After searching a bit, this product might be a better alternative. I am going to try and update. So far looks decent: ""Aloe Life Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Skin Gel"""
1,"The author is an unoriginal, untalented illustator & writer","This is an absolutely pathetic book. The illustrator/author merely copied famous works of art from the Reniassance period. Wait, I shouldn't say copied: He made weak attempts at the imitation of these masterpieces. Could he not come up with something slightly original in text and drawing? Please save your money."
2,...not the best one,"This book has really nice pictures at all but after learning so much about the history of costume at university I was really unsatisfied with this book. It could have been more structure in it, too."
4,"Awfulness of Epic, and Hilarious, Proportions","Jersey Shore Shark Attack is one of those Syfy original movies that was made for a handful of spare change, with CGI special effects that represent the state of the art for the Commodore 64 era. It's also a very, very funny film, and not just in an ironic way. There is a witty screenplay here, and fun performances from a bunch of unknown actors and b-grade celebrities who are very good sports (Joey Fantone, you are awesome!). It takes a talented cast to play characters this dumb and make it believable. An enjoyable film for a Friday night with some beer and a bunch of friends."
1,Weekest movie,"I don't like writing bad reviews, but this is one of the saddest movies that been put out. And I couldn't watch anymore then 20 mins. I don't care for the Jersey show, and sure there people who like that. But to make a movie just like the show, thats really low, lame, can I go on more. Some may like it, but again, I just rather go get dental work done without pain killers to watch this. Thats how bad it is to me.But if you like the Jersey show, then I can see you may like this movie, think its all beyond...Only good thing I can say about this movie. It's and effort to make a interesting movie..."
4,A very good book! Definetly worth reading!,"After seeing the only one review, giving it a one star, I felt I had to respond. Even though this book is not 'perfect' (like 'Replay' is), this is a very very good book. It has a very unique perspective, since some of the heroes of the book are actually dolphins - and Mr. Grimwood has done a very good job telling the story from their eyes. You can actually feel how much Mr. Grimwood loves the sea, dolphins and other sea creatures."
4,Dolphin in My Mind,"This book is cool. It does such a great job of exploring the concepts of dolphin intelligence and sentience, and it does it in the context of a compelling adventure. Ken Grimwood is probably not too far off the mark of what we will eventually discover about dolphin intelligence and communication. He really has thought this stuff through. If you know about dolphins, you'll know more.. and if you've never thought about them as thinking/sentient beings, you'll definitely have something to think about with this one."
3,It was okay...,"It was an okay book to pass the time. I was hoping for something more along the lines of ""Replay"". Mostly I just wanted to say to whoever cares, lobsters are NOT only red when they're cooked. I work in a restaurant and have seen live red lobsters with my own eyes."
3,It's not THAT bad,"While the book does have bad grammar...and yes they capitalize words in the middle of the sentence AND explain the more difficult words, the stories are entertaining. I have read it to students in Kindergarten and Grade One, and they seemed to enjoy the stories, in fact they ask for more! I agree that the author isn't perfect, but she is entertaining and I would like to read more of her books."
2,A bad book with bad grammar.,"This book is great (if your seven!!). The grammar is so bad and they capitilize every other word and explain simple words as if we were all some kind of idiots. In closing, this book is so bad that you should give it to your worst enemy for Christmas and annoy her by reading it to her every day."
2,Not Even A Good B Movie,"Malcolm McDowell plays an evil Nazi and doesn't even do that very well. The rest of the movie is pretty irrelevant.Spanish peasant farmer is recruited to bring some guy wanted by the Nazis (never did figure out why), across the Pyrenees from France into Spain. Wanted man insists on bringing his family with him (any resemblance to the Sound of Music is purely coincidental).Lots of, stupid action shots (trains exploding when shot at with a machine gun), unexplained events (why was the train full of resistance fighters), ridiculous over dramatic clips (pouring 2 cans of gasoline on a peasant during war time, reminiscing about the 3rd Reich in the middle of the interrogation of a prisoner), and a terrible ending (you are going to die in a few seconds).MM was the only character worth watching, every other name appeared to want to get this rubbish over with asap.At least there was no singing."
3,Bright lights,"The AIWA FR-A200 AM/FM Clock Radio works about as one would expect a low-end clock radio to work (if its music you are after there are better radios in the $60.00 range, but for news and early morning traffic reports who needs fine reproduction). The controls are fairly easy to get used to, although the ""Sleep"" button is sometimes a little difficult to locate in the dark. The ""Snooze"" button is a snap to find. The only drawback of this Clock Radio is that the green luminous numbers on the clock are VERY bright and may keep light sleepers awake. The light from the radio might fool you into thinking dawn has come earlier than expected. Otherwise I have no problems with this machine."
3,ok i guess,When i got this creme it was not very much of a creme. i wanted something more thick but it does the job.
3,OK -- but they're ICE TEA spoons,"I guess I didn't understand that what an ice tea spoon is -- but they are long and skinny and small. Good for stirring and eating yogurt, but that's about it."
1,careful,be aware this is an upgrade product...you must have an older version of windows before you install it
1,Dang it!!!,Was hoping for a smooth upgrade from Windows 2000 to XP Pro.Didn't happen. FYI - always back up before monkeying withupgrades!What a pain. I hope the OS works better than the upgrade process.
4,A Classic Children's CD,"This recording is one of my children's favorite. Yes, the narrator's voice is different, but so what? These traditional stories have great humanity. And I love listening to them as much as my children. The music is pleasing for all generations. While these are ""magical tales"" there is no oversimlification; you feel as if the family is siting at the knees of the local story teller. It's wondeful."
4,I like the phone,Nice phone. Looks and feels great. Just some problems. Mute button is definitely in the wrong place and when you dial a number you cannot hear any sound so one doens;t know if it has actually got pressed or not. Otherwise its small and works very well. Has a great battery life. Hasn't died even once and I keep it off the charger all the time.
2,Take a pass,I have owned this phone for awhile. The range is worse than my 900 MHz phone and the battery cover keeps slipping off. Good look and feel to it but that's it.
5,Dream Theater Continues to Rock,"I'm a huge Dream Theater fan. My favorite CD of theirs is Scenes From A Memory...now onto the new stuff.Train of Thought definitely has some great songs. Dream Theater continues to rock in so many ways. This CD really brings out the best of everyone in the band. DT is still at the top of the game. I've played guitar for awhile now, and I can't wait to start learning some of the riffs from Train of Thought. You've gotta buy this CD."
4,NuMetal ?!!! I don't think so ...,"ToT is one of the amazin' Progressive Metal album ever made. For people who called them selves DT's/Prog's Fans n said this one is NuMetal Album, ""Did you have listen this entire album ???"" This is Prog, Man!!! Which have no main regulation when the musician playing the music n show their skill n talent.Can't wait for their Asian Tour >>> Singapore ..""Play It Loud, Man !!!"""
2,bland boring blah,"I've been a fan since '89 when nobody knew they existed and it pains me to say that TOT is just short of an absolute flop. I wanted to like it and listened several times hoping it would get better but it never happened. This album has no life, no soul, no nothing, never goes anywhere. Unbelievably Petrucci's solos are also boring. Shredding for the sake of shredding. The first 4 tracks drag on and on and on for a minimum of 10 minutes each, totally formulaic and going through the motions.Falling Into and Six Degrees were mediocre overall but had flashes of brilliance which warranted extended listening. Not the case here as TOT will gather dust in my CD rack."
2,Compared to all other DT's- this is soooo weak,"Not much to say- this album is just full of forgetable songs, It plays the least of all my DT albums- Its just kinda sad. Buy the new one 1st- its way better. Maybe start with Scenes from a Memory.......uuuugggghhhh I dont even want to look at this album again- I cant go 1 star- because I like DT. ITS 2 stars for DT- not comapred with all other records"
1,haha who cares!!!!!!!,you take this way too seriously-- i almosy feel bad for you-- almost- THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!!!
1,A Train Derailed,"Dream Theater needs to lighten up. The band represents the five best musicians in today's progressive rock field but lyrically and musically this effort has slipped off the tracks.Detractors have long debated that DT's output is musicianship and not music. This CD makes their case. Complex time shifts appear to happen randomly without consequence to the song as a whole.The musical tone of these songs is bleak and joyless with anger and self-pity as the supporting lyrical content. This isn't entertaining, it's oppressive. I'll take another Liquid Tension Experiment release over this threnodic collection."
2,Disappointing.....,"Let me say first that DT is still the best band in the world!!Having said that, even great bands can put out bad CD's.....or maybe I should say bad idea for a CD. Past DT CD's mixed heavy, driving songs with songs that allowed you to breath. A DT CD was a journey, taking you through a mix of emotions.ToT is one emotion: angry. It sounds like they were going for the Lincoln Park, Godsmack thing; only with more musicianship!"
1,Rip off,"From the moment I heard DT, I was mesmerized by the brilliance and inovative drive behind this band. Petrucci is of course a great guitar player and the band, as a whole, a group of very talented musicians. This album makes all of these accolades go away. This album cannot be described as anything but a huge rip off. I bought every other DT album without listening to it first and, granted that some are better than others, never felt cheated. I will never buy another DT album again without listening to it first, if ever. Do not, repeat, do not buy this album. Specially if you're a DT fan... if you're not yet, it's not with this album that you'll be one."
3,"Spammer, all is forgiven","I've found that of all DT albums I've listened to, this one gets the least play. I'm thinking of selling it, rather than let it collect dust. Man, I must have been in denial or something.Much as I hate to say it, this is definitely the nadir of DT's career. Hopefully, we'll hear more of Rudess on 'Octavarium'."
2,Could have been MUCH BETTER!!!,"I am a big Dream Theater fan. They are my all-time favorite band. I greatly enjoyed this album, but it is definately their worst release so far (too heavy, not outstnding songs). it gets 2- 2 1/2 stars because though it is still a great album, all of their other albums are much, much better; I expected more from them! I hope they go back to Metropolis pt. 2-style for Octavarium."
1,no title needed,"This is another pedestrian album from a highly overrated band. Don't get me wrong: these guys have chops to kill, but good chops do not make great progressive rock. The biggest problem I have with this band is that all their songs sound alike - melodically clumsy and harmonically poor. There just is not enough original ideas, although there are occasional interesting instrumental passages. The vocalist just sucks, and overall they sound like a neo-prog band on steroids"
1,Worst DT,I like all of the other DT's a lot! But this one just doesnt cut it- i hope their new one is better! A LOT better
2,Mmmmm !!!!,"For DT : Please, please, please. Make a clear line between Metal and Prog Rock. I'm sure you can mix between it.I have a suggestion, maybe you should working together with Spock's Beard (Although, I know you already work together !!)."
1,no,"I love Dream Theater, but this album is for me the biggest disappointment in prog music. It's definetely their worst studio album. It's monotonous, repeating, with interjected John's solos which are technically perfect, but not captivating. I also miss Jordan's keyboards and Mike's typical drums. It seems to me that they lost invention, they repeat the parts from their previous albums (especially mid part of ""This Dying Soul"" is pure copy of ""Glass Prison""), but this I wouldn't mind the most. The worst is that the whole album reminds me of Metallica, at first I didn't want to admit it, but it's a matter of fact. I hope that they won't go this way."
3,"it's DT, but where is the music","what in the world's happened to DT? First of all I don't own the previous 6DOIT, I've never even listened to it so I wouldn't be able to talk about the progress. what I can say is that this is by far the worst DT album I have yet listened to.Uninspired is the word. These songs don't only all sound alike they also sound like a dozen other bands (Metallica for the most, but also KORN (seriously), and even Linkin Park (the rapping parts in As I Am)).this is not the Dream Theater I have fallen in love with. I am a musical person and I love inventiveness, creativity etc in music. when I heard SFAM and IAW for the first time I was totally startled by the musical wit and talent the band has.but this is just a bunch of very, yes nu-metal-style low chords and cheesy lyrics. no kidding. I hope there will be better times for these guys and until then I'd rather recommend real progrock like yes, pink floyd or just the older DT stuff.-3 stars still cause it's DT"
4,This is not Nu-Metal!,"How can anyone say that this album sounds like Godsmack or Tool(who, incidentally, are not Nu-Metal --> that would be Korn or Limp Bizkit, and yes there is a difference)?I have to wonder at the people that give this album 1 star. Do they even like DT or are just faking so they can seem intellectual to their friends? Clearly, this album is far and away better than anything else out there right now and probably will be as long as Blink 182 and all the wannabe punk bands are on EmptyV. That is justice enough for at least 3 stars.To call this Nu-Metal is blasphemous."
3,2 1/2 to 3 stars- in between,"OK OK OK- some of these reviews are too harsh- 1 star? CMON- Here is my REVIEW- Images and Words, and Scenes are their two best Albums- hands down- you could also throw in Awake- THEY ARE 5 STARS- no doubt- Falling was a bit of a comercial let down- 4 stars- Six Degress was OK- 1st cd sucked- 2ns cd saved it- 3 1/2 stars- TRAIN is thier worst by far- NON- PROG and fake metallica/ish metal- STREAM is the only good prog song- the rest is just petruccis abusing his talents and Rudess not even noticeable- I HOPE THEIR NEXT ALBUM IS MORE PROGGY!! dont let us down DT!!!!"
3,I was expecting more,"I'll preface this with saying that DT is my favorite band, and my fave DT album is Images and Words, so I was hoping for something along the lines of Six Degrees, which was freakin awesome also. I liked ""As I Am"" when I first heard it before I purchased the album, but then when I listened to it through I was kind of turned off by the ever-present pounding and rumbling that kicked your rear seven times to sunday. Sure if you like that kind of stuff, this is the best, but I was looking forward to more melodies. Of course this is just an initial review- I've already listened to ""In the Name of God"" again and liked it much better the second time. Hopefully it'll grow on me."
2,Very Disappointing.,"I want to start off by saying that i am a HUGE fan of DT and i went into this album thinking i was getting a great album, as we've come to expect from DT. Well, let's just say i was very disappointed. DT totally dropped the ball and made a mediocre Metallica-esque album that is not bad, just not DT. All of the songs sound almost the same, except the pitifully terrible Vacant, and the Superb Stream of conciousness. All of the other songs are okay, but they don't have that talent or oomph that we usually get from DT. There are some monstrous Petrucci and Portnoy moments, but they don't seem to match the song they're in. It wouldn't be a bad album if it wasn't from DT, because we expect so much more from them. Unless you're truly diehard, or you are open to new types of music, AVOID."
4,Grew on me...,"When I first got this album I thought it was OK, but nothing special. I listened to it a few times and then put it away. I just pulled it out again a couple weeks ago and WOW...all of the sudden it ROCKED!! I have no idea why it suddenly appeals to me so much, but I really enjoyed it when I played it this time. I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought ""Images ans Words"" due to the good reviews of that album and I was NOT disappointed - that CD is AMAZING!! My favorite bands are Opeth, Pink Floyd, In Flames, The Cure, Hypocrisy, Katatonia, Into Eternity, Porcupine Tree and Tool, so if you have similar interests you might like Dream Theater."
2,If you like good songwriting...,"don't get this CD. Nothing grabbed me. I've listened to and been a fan of DT since '92. I've seen them on every tour, sometimes multiple times per tour. I can appreciate the artistic endeavor, and I can't fault them for doing the music they want, but I just don't care for the writing on this album. The musicianship is nothing short of stunning, but who cares if the song isn't worth listening to in the first place.Jordan's performances were great. His restraint and new sounds worked well. James's performance is also quite good. Those were the two bright spots on the album for me.I was so disappointed in this cd that I gave it away. I hope it is appreciated more by the new owner. I'm passing on this tour. Sorry guys. I just don't think this is your best effort to date. In fact, I liked Falling into Infinity more."
2,Not the Same Band!!,"Being a Woman- I like the songs that emphasize more vocals- Past Dream Theater songs really got me into this band- (and my husband showing me the songs) When he bought this album I was very excited to hear it- after listening to it for a while- I had to turn it off- there is one slow song, but its not very good- I feel the vocals here are not that good- This album is WAY too heavy, and ""not proggy enough"" - explains my husband.- He likes it however-"
3,Dim visions,"Although it is pretty depressing to see such poorly calculated nu-metal mediocrities infect the band's dynamic synergy to this point, many a fiercely extended instrumental passage and a strong finish helps keep the album from becoming a total mess."
2,LEAST FAV DT ALBUM- BY FAR,"This album is my least favorite of all DT- except ""When Dream and Day Unite"" of course- Its just not very progressive- a lot of technical showing off- its just not DT- Labrie- I really hope you dont RAP in DT's next album! Its prob 2 1/2 stars- get it if you like DT- but I dont reccomend for a new listener- start with Scenes from a memory, or Images and Words."
2,I shoulda read these articles before buyin',"Some reviewer wrote ""Buy it...You won't regret it""...He was WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. It's been said many times...NO Melody...Blistering, forgetful, scale guitar solos...NO Melody (oops, I already said that). These are probably the most talented rock musicians and I meant MUSICIANS on the face of the earth, but where's the MUSICAL creativity? It hurts me to say it...A waste of phenomenal talent. A BIG dissappointment. Good keyboard solos, though. (Mom always told me to end on a POSITIVE note)"
5,It's A 5 Star Album....From A 10 Star Band,"This album is fantastic. The music is all great (with the exception of the fairly dissapointing 'This Dying Soul') and the songs definately don't lack appeal. It's a nice, heavy departure from the bands progressive roots.But there-in lies the problem. Basically they've stripped down the progressive feel of Scenes From A Memory and Images and Words and just come out with a straight up heavy metal album. It's still excellent, but it's not Dream Theater excellent.Highlights on the album are As I Am, Honor Thy Father, Vacant, and In The Name of God. Each of these songs - with the exception of Vacant - are very heavy, and very loud. Mike Portnoy's drums don't quite stand out as much as I'd like, but have their moments, such as Honor Thy Father.While it it's not up to par with everything else Dream Theater, the album definately deserves credit as better than most metal albums."
2,boring!!!,I agree with some of the reviews below-- esp the one right below me- but its better than 1 star- Id say two- Images and Scenes are 5 stars- awake 4- change 3-- THIS ALBUM just doesent work
5,They wrote the album in THREE WEEKS!,"If you watch the video clips on the enhanced CD, Mike Portney and John Petrucci talk about how they wrote ""Train of Thought"" in three weeks!Dream Theater never ceases to amaze me. This album is the epitome of modern progressive metal. There aren't many bands out there who can write, produce, and execute as well as DT. This album is exemplary of their development into one of the best progressive rock bands of all time.Musically, this album departs from the more melodic and borderline rock tradition evidenced on their previous album. Train of Thought takes on an aggressive and serious theme reminiscent of Images and Words, with Petrucci trading off solos with Rudess like a tennis match! The rhythm section is as tight as ever on this one...and you can actually hear John Myung!I can't wait to see them live again.BUY THIS ALBUM!"
4,Kick [behind] from Start to Finish,"This album is heavy, fast and full of pure emotion that only DT can deliver. From the Orionesque instrumental ""Stream of Consciousness"" to the raw power of ""Honor Thy Father"" this disc has it all. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up!"
1,HYPOCRITE-,GUESS WHAT- IF I DONT LIKE THE NEW DT- GONNA SPAM THAT ONE AS WELL- YOU WONT BEAT ME- HAHAHAHAHAHA
1,TOT dissapoints- STILL,this album is now a coaster for my drinks- it is that bad- STREAN is the only good song
1,"worst DT- bad, bad album","This album is a disgrace to prog music- it should be in the metal section, not prog"
1,This is Horrible,to give this cd 5 stars is plain disgusting and pathetic- only nerds would think this is 5 stars
2,come clear!!!!!!,"Ive been reading some of these reviews- and the 5 star reviews a few below does not make sence at all- he said ""True its not some of their best stuff"" SO WHY GIVE IT 5 STARS????????? ruins your review---stop there- SCENES and AWAKE- are 4/5 star albums- dont rank this one with them--geez"
2,Bleh?,"Stream is a very good prog song- As I Am is decent as well, as for the rest of the album- its plain horrible progressive music- its crappy metal- WHAT HAPPENED? This Sying Soul is one of the worst songs I have ever heard--- its amazingly bad--- 2 great songs"
5,what an album!,"the review down was really helpful.,though i don't agree with some of the reviews...the latest was accurate,though i really thought petrucci would add a little bit of old school dreamtheater.His riffs seem robotic and without life.I liked myung,how his bass starts in ""as i am"" with the harmonics.It tells people how bass can be versatile.Rudess gave a little bit of flavor in TOT especially in ""in the name of god"". Overall, i liked the content of TOT. A classic album which i'll listen to while headbanging.keep it up DT!"
1,3 stars? haha Hardly!!!,"This is easily the worst DT album to date. The songs are so boreing I couldn't listen to the entire thing. I had to come back to it several times before I heard the entire thing. It's a total waste of time if you own any other 2 DT CDs as every riff and rhythm is on every previous CD. Reminds me of the Who song ""Same Old Song"" ....... ""We write the same old Song with a few new lines and no one seems to hear it"" It's the same scale contest with a bit more metal influence. YAWN"
3,After 5th listening,"TOT requires patience. Dream Theater requires patience. Not a single record persuaded me at once, not a single one disappointed after further consideration.TOT is not brilliant. Especially Petrucci, a very skilled guitar player, confuses inspiration with - partially - stupid and senseless speed.Some songs like This Dying soul are simply too heavy, too fast, stupid.The very clear MEtallica and - how awful!!! - new metal influences are not to be overheard.But some parts in some songs are really good. As i Am, Stream of consciouness, or In the name of god.Dream Theater has released a good, not a very good album which contains a mixture of occasionaly atmospheric parts, over-complexed and stupidly-fast guitar parts, as well as some Dream THeater (""As I am"", Stream, and In The NAme of God).A good, but the worst album so far."
1,DT headed in wrong direction,I know that im not in the band- but they need to wake up- and go back to their roots- they are getting worse and worse
4,Damn Good,"Train of Thought may not be Dream Theater's high-point of their carrer, but it comes damn close. Train of Thought is not much of a prog album, but more metal. The songs are long, the riffs fast and dirty, and James LiBrie's vocals match the songs perfectly. The highlights of this little album are ""Honor Thy Father, Endless Sacrifice, This Dying Soul and In The Name of God"" Each one is a monster, ripping and tearing through the minds of people who can enjoy such a good effort by the best band out there today. Nothing will ever match DT's ""Images and Words"" or their ""Scenes From a Memory"" but it can come close. Train of Thought does that. One of the best metal albums out there today."
4,A Great CD From Dream Theater,"This CD is great. Dream Theater added a more heavy, distorted feel to their music, but the songs still have their sense of technique and style. Tracks 1,2,3, and 7 are some of the best songs I have ever heard. John Patrucci has some wicked guitar licks to go along with this CD. Rudess also has a lot of time blocks to show his talent as well.I don't know why some of the fans don't like this CD. Maybe it's because they don't like heavier music. Keep in mind, it is still Dream Theater's style. Endless Sacrifice is my new favorite song, so I'd recommend listening to it.If you liked ""Images and Words"" and ""Scenes From a Memory"" you will definitly enjoy this album. The only reason I gave the CD a 4/5 stars is because Scenes From a Memory can't be beaten."
4,Worried,"A lot of this has been said before, but I would tend to agree that I'm concerned for where DT is heading. I enjoy the metal/angry/dark aspects of the CD, but the lyrics for most of the songs are not quite there. The biggest problem for me is that the ""vocal experimenting,"" that some have praised this for, is heading in the direction of nu-metal rather than prog-metal. Don't get me wrong, LaBrie still has a great voice, but it almost sounds like he's trying to hard to fit in a rappish style in some of the songs."
3,Good for what it is.,"I was very disappointed upon listening to this album the first time and even more so the more I listen to it. Yes, the playing is as stellar as is to be expected which is why I gave this album a 3 star rating. However, this is certainly not what I expect out of a group with the talent level of Dream Theater. The song writing is rather poor and undeveloped and the lyrics are about worthless. This album accomplishes one thing: Anger. There are no textural layers or growth in the music. The lyrics don't take you on a journey, they just pontificate. There is no depth of emotion as with previous albums. Yes, the album is great for what it is...But it's not worthy of a Dream Theater title."
3,Pieces but no where near whole.,"There are shades of individual brilliance, but this album is far from cohesive -- the chemistry is completely missing. It would be unfair to compare this with any of their earlier records. Was it bad production or was it the band? When I heard the whole album my mind couldn't help think whether most of the material was written individually by Petrucci, Myung and Jordan and put together much later in the process without great emphasis on unision, as opposed to the band working together and trimming loose ends. What ever they did, they didn't do it right. Since it is Dream Theater we are talking about, it is hard to believe, they are lacking in effort. But something could have been done do make good individual performance sound better as a song. May be they just need a long break to relax and put together some fluid music."
2,.....?????,"Fabulous musicians, beatiful production and excellent sound .... but music must have a little bit of soul, creativity, fantasy! It's terribly long and annoying, they just wanted to show us how well they play their instruments. Strictly for fans."
2,"Train of ,Thought master of puppets was all ready written?","I've been into DT since images and words. Unfortunately this record is not what I I've been waiting for, if I wanted to lission to metallica I would have bought it."
5,Chunky,"When I reach for my Dream Theater CDs, I'm looking for an outrageous musical experience. Train of Thought picks up right where The Glass Prison left off (undeniably the best track from a lackluster Six Degrees album) and delivers. Take it or leave it, on this album the boys look to drop your jaw with excessive speed over thick and ballsy riffs, with great success. Rudess and Petrucci have never sounded better since Jordan joined the band, dueling and exchanging solos throughout the album (save the first keyboard-less track). Although sometimes the musical interludes seem out of place or even pointless, they will never cease to blow your mind. Seeing them play it live is all the more mind-boggling. How they remember it all, it's hard to imagine.For those of you who think Petrucci plays with no soul, listen to the ""soaring"" melody throughout This Dying Soul."
2,the end,"This is definitely the end of a great band, they should've retired a long time ago, the music in this cd is just opaque, james labrie's voice is ridiculous, jordan rudess should play in a circus, john petrucci is a great guitarist but simply stuck on the same style mike portnoy is the same as petrucci but 100 times worse and john myung is the only one worth a listen, really if you're new to dt buy the first 4 albums starting from when dream and day unite until a change of seasons, if you're a dt fan buy it you'll love it if you plan to evolve in life and look for quality don't even come close to it."
2,Huge disappointment!!,"Their is not much to say, I am a long time fan of Dream Theater and have seen them live several times. This album only sounds like Dream Theater on some songs. It's heavy and lacking feeling, other than anger. I am extremely disappointed. If I wanted to listen to old Metallica, Pantera, or Joe Satriani I would put their cd in. Two stars is very generous in my opinion."
1,Very disappointed,"Has anyone noticed that Dream Theater have gotten more weird with time. This is at least as weird as 6DOIT but with less effort and time spent on it. This is a very heavy, dark, and angry CD. As one of the other reviewers noted: ""If you are a true DT fan, you already own this CD"" and I do. It is aweful! Being a guitarist for 30+ years, I certainly appreciate great chops and Petrucci is one of the best. This is an excecise in non-musical over-indulgence by Petrucci and Portnoy. I am disappointed in the ""token"" keyboard passages...Rudess deserves better. This is Metallica doing Dream Theater doing Metallica. DT needs to get out of the 80's and at least get into the 90's with their musical direction. Images and Words is BY FAR their best effort and it has been down hill from there. Don't waste your money on this. Buy Megellan's Impossible Figures instead."
1,1 1/2 STARS,"For Dream Theater- this is not very good- i never thought i'd give a band like DT a 1 1/2 stars- but im comparing this album to others that they have done- Awake is my favorite, followed by Images in words- then Scenes from a memory- falling is next- then 6 degrees- this is last on the list- hope their new one is prog- and not metal! Sorry DT!! I still love ya--"
4,good 'n heavy,"this one's very good and has many heavier parts than their other cd's.the heavy parts are also technical as hell,though,so it doesn't sound like most the ""heavy"" crap on the radio-this is what""nu-metal"" should've evolved into!it is a definate must-have for any dream theater fan,or probably the best cd for beginners along with ""awake"".also,if you want somthing that's a total trip-and-a-half go to the dream theater website and order their live cover cd of metallica's master of puppets(yes,the WHOLE thing start to finish!)."
2,Why do they insist engrossing Metallica?,"When I listened to the previous DT album (6DOIT) I thought that 1st CD whas really awful, a stupid and fruitless replica of Metallica, however the 2nd CD made that album a decent album. This one, unfortunately, is simply an evolution (maybe a regression) of that 1st CD. Perhaps DT have definitely lost their melody.. However, if you like the previous (real) DT album, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!"
2,I shoulda read these articles before buyin',"Some reviewer wrote ""Buy it...You won't regret it""...He was WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. It's been said many times...NO Melody...Blistering, forgetful, scale guitar solos...NO Melody (oops, I already said that). These are probably the most talented rock musicians and I meant MUSICIANS on the face of the earth, but where's the MUSICAL creativity? I hurts me to say it...A waste of phenomenal talent. A BIG dissappointment. Good keyboard solos, though. (Mom always told me to end on a POSITIVE note)"
5,Heavy Metal Thunder!,I have been reading the other reviews comparing it to metallica and that like and I have to say that who cares!!! It still sounds like Dream theater to me. If there can be any comparisons at all maybe at the start of the first track it sounds a bit like Black Sabbath but again who cares!! Like anything that D.T. does it is done to perfection and in this case while they decided to do a heavy metal explosion! it still is brilliant!. These guys are very talented and I trust the band will keep changing and keep progressing with the art form. Dream Theater have proven themselves over and over again with the writing and production abilities. Train of thought is a classic in every sense unlike that St Anger rubbish that i used as a frisbie!!! It seems interesting to me that it takes a band like Dream Theater to set the record straight about how a metal album should be. I cant wait to hear the next one.....
3,pretty funny joke,"This really is a Liquid Tension Experiement project. People should know this before buying. As Dream Theater, it is 2 stars. As LTE, 3 stars. So I give it a 3 to be charitable. One star for each week they supposedly spent laboring over this.6DIT had a few great songs among an otherwise fairly inchoherent double CD. This time , Dream Theater admits up front it has run out of ideas so blast away. To see how how a band that respects its fans enough to actually spend effort on a CD (and also change its sound), try Rush's incredible Vapor Trails. They spent more time on one song than DT spent on this entire CD, and it is obvious.But I'm an optimist and assume they will enjoy touring, relaxing, and _then_ put out a real Dream Theater CD. It will be great to have in 2006."
1,Progman,"What can I say about this 'homage' that has not already been said? A total waste of time and talent is my opinion, they are akin to Genesis taking a break during 'The lamb..' and instead of looking ahead and trying something new, taking a break and doing an 'homage' to 60's soul music... Glas that DID NOT happen to Genesis, but DT seemed to have taken it upon themselves to be a 80s thrash metal band here for a CD. Do I actually hear the song 'Blackened' from Metallica's '88 album '..and justice for all' in there..I do! 'As I am' is DTs 'Enter sandman' and 'Stream of conciousness' is their 'Orion'. Oh dear, oh dear... SUCH a phenomenal waste of talent, energy and time. The MOST shocking thing to me is that most fans dont see it, but I guess most of them are the ones too young to ever see Metallica when they were not a pop band. I LOVE DT, especially 'Images and words', 'Six degrees..' and 'Metropolis2' but this is not the right way for them to go. Sure I made a few enemies now.."
1,NOT SO FAST,"If you put the disc in your comp- you find out they wrote this album in three weeks!!!! IT SHOWS!!!!!!!! None of these tracks are worth many listens- except maybe STREAM- (agree with reviewer below) but unlike the moron below- 3 stars is too much- to be soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo disapointed by this band pisses me off- like a friend betrayed you--- I USED TO LOVE DT- NOW I JUST LIKE THEM- bring on symphony x, vanden plas, and pagan's mind!!!! ( yes i know these bands are all heavily influenced by DT- dont care!!)"
1,1 1/2 stars,WAAAAYYY below previous efforts- and worse than even their 1st album- for DT- 1 1/2 stars- I used to think they were prog...but... i guess not........
3,"Hey, it's Dream Theater, so it's okay.","This album isn't horrible. It's clear that DT wanted to create a more thrashy, heavier, sound on this release. However, I thought the first track was painfully awful, and it took me some time to recover before I could start digesting the compositions later in the album.Ultimately, there are some maniacally genius moments here - but, for the most part it just isn't accessible enough. And I'm saying that from the point of view of a DT fan who has listened to and thoroughly enjoyed some of their other albums. There were too many times when this album just lost me in the sludge between the more interesting structures.Still, DT do what DT does. And this is exactly that. They aren't just a progressive band on the track level, they are also a progressive band on the album level - where each album progresses and introduces new styles and nuances. All is forgiven."
5,Another Master Piece From Dream Theater,"This is a great album. I love every dream theater album, and most require you to be musician/dream theater fan to really appreciate it. However I think this will be more popular among the people that don't fit this category. This is way better than anything out there right now. Damn near everything out there sounds the same. AND nothing has a guitar solo anymore, let alone any kind of lead guitar, nice drum beats, etc. Everything out there is just a couple riffs, verses, and choruses. Nothing has the diversity and trasnition that are in these songs. Most musicians out there in todays popular bands do not play nearly as well these guys. My best suggestion is that you see these guys live, nothing compares.A lot of this ablum has the sound that Metallic should have had that not created that piece of trash St Anger."
5,Different Approach,"I have been a HUGE fan since the video Pull Me Under (off Images and Words....second album for those who don't know) hit Headbangers Ball on MTV (When they used to play metal...... actualy, when the used to play music in general.) If you have been following the updates on them before the album came out, they did say that they were putting out a classic metal album (old Metallica, Megadeth.) Knowing this, I was very surprised that the was the typical technicality and length of DT....the way that DT can only do and not make it sound boring. All their albums were different and this one continues the tradition. Unlike Metallica (where all albums are different) this one is actually awesome. If you like The Glass Prison (off 6doit) and its heaviness, you definately will like this album. If you are looking for Images And Words 2 or Metropolis Part 3: Stream Of Consiousness, then this album is not for you."
2,Ouch,What the hell are these guys thinking? Why do they thinking people can handle 12 minute average songs that intense? The solo's are just shredding and technical show off. I'm disappointed because DT starts to sound like a loony tune soundtrack instaid of honest thoughtfull songwriting. Training of Wrists is a better name!Im waiting for the New Symphony X- porcupine tree- and i would rather listen to Dreamscape- this is horrid!!!!
2,"What was their ""train of thought"" when doing this?","This album sipmly just blows and as a DT fan I'm very disapointed. It seems obvious that they have forgoten the lesson of ""Falling into infinity"" and released something really commercial. It looks like now they are going for that Godsmack/Disturbed/new Metallica sound which I can't stand. When bands used to say thay they are playing heavy they meant something in the vain of Iron Maiden/Megadeth/old Metallica, but now it is used to discribe the Nu Metal sound. Not to say it doesn't have its moments, but over all this album is a downer. Overall the complex technical and song writting that they are known for is gone in this album. I think that a two to three year break is in order for DT and they should remember why they have had the following they have had for years."
3,Not Typical Dream Theater - NOT GOOD that is!,"I also own every Dream Theater release and a few bootlegs. I thought DT set the bar for success and good progressive metal. Well they just lowered it. Maybe its because I found bands like EverGrey and musicians like Arjen Lucassen. But I had this CD overnighted to me - and I was hugely disappointed. I did NOT expect something great, or something that was mix of this and that album. I just expected a solid outing by a band I really like. I figured there would be some re-hash, some new sounds, some great songs, and some great concepts. I was wrong.I was BORED! Train of Thought was a good song (but still had weak moments), but I bought the whole CD not just a CD/Single.I also found myself in familiar music territory with some of these melodies and progressions. Not overly creative. I amazed that this got any perfect reviews.If you are a DT fan - buy it. If you are not - buy Awake, Images and Words or another earlier release first."
5,ungodly amazing,"dream theater never ceases to amaze. this album is not another awake, or SFAM. it is not a new Images and Words, instead it is the progression of the greatest progresive rock band today. more metal, more balls, more speed from petrucci, everything you could want. some people said the songs didnt grab you like awake did, just listen to ""This Dying Soul"" (track 2) its an amazing song and the solos are incredible. in my opinion one of their greatest efforts, comparable to 6DOIT and Awake"
1,The decline continues,"The question is when DT will hit the rock-bottom. I hope ""ToT"" is and that they will rise again. I think the fact that songwriting for this...took not more than 3 weeks says everything. And for the people who claim this to be their heaviest: PUH-LEEZ!!!"
2,Dream Theater's Grunge Debut Sounds Like Alice In Chains,I realize I have made enemies here but th title says it all. The thought of this band trying to sound like AIC is a nightmare from beginning to end. Boring and disappointing. A few sloppily played speed metal solos don't save grace either. Returned to the store for a refund.
1,NOT GOOD,"FOR TRUE DT FANS- THIS IS A NIGHTMARE- PLAIN AND SIMPLE- If we wanted a metal album- we would have boght Metallica- I WANTED DT!!! Stream is the only good PROG song!!!! I know many agree with me!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED DT? i feel used.....excuse me while i go shower (just tried to listen to the horrific ""dying soul"""
5,Clasic Dream Theater,Includes two of their best songs. This is one of the darker DT albums. It also includes part of the 12 step suite
1,AGREE,i agree with the last review- but i think its worse- not good prog- check out the new pagan's mind or symphony x instead!
5,Stupid 1-star reviews,"This is not a 5-star album, but that idiot's influence needs to be neutralized, thus..."
1,I Agree- time to move on,There are plety of bands out there- that are surpassing this band- They used to be at Prog Top- Now they are slipping into the middle
4,TOT is the best metal record since Master of Puppets but...,"Dream Theater could (and has been) so much more.I am not a muscician so I will not discuss the merits (or lack thereof) of the musical performances in this recording. However, I will comment on the direction this album seems to be taking the band. DT has often been a band of stylistical imitators (not originators). This seems to be increasingly the case and will likely remain the case if Portnoy and Petrucci continue to self-produce their recordings. To fully fulfill the potential, this band needs an outside viewpoint in the rehersal and recording studios; think how different this record might have been with any number of producers: Steve Albini, Brendan O'Brien, Rupert Hyne, etc."
4,Awesome,"Dream Theater still has it and rocks on Train of Thought !!These guys are in a leauge all by themselves... This LP has enough drive and musical mastery. The best thing about this LP is that it never gives up and gets better with each song...I don't have a favorite song on this LP because all the songs are fantastic, but if I had to pick one it would be Stream of Consciousness...."
2,Eh.,"It's an ok album. I wasn't expecting much from it to begin with, and aside from Stream of Consciousness and In The Name of God, I don't really hear anything interesting on here. The band just sounds like they ran out of ideas and took a bunch of them from the Metallica/Megadeth playbook. I don't mind constant change and progression, even occasional tributes to influences (but not as blatant as the ""Blackened"" vocal section in ""This Dying Soul""). But this... just doesn't do it for me. ""Going metal"" does not equal tuning down, playing uninteresting, unmelodic solos and trying to sound like a tough guy. It's like they're not even trying anymore."
2,sort of funny,"It's weird. The people who like this album compare it with the recent DT albums, which aren't good either. I can only say that this is not DT."
3,Decent,"Dream Theater's hard and heavy album, with metal riffs galore.I enjoyed Train of Thought's assault the first couple of songs through, but it eventually bored me. The heavy metal sound works well in some parts, especially on This Dying Soul and Endless Sacrifice (the best songs on the album), but the almost nu-metal feeling of songs like As I Am and Honor Thy Father drag them down. John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy blast through these long, pounding sounds with a ferocity like no other DT album out there, and they play so fast and furiously that at times it's hard to keep your head from spinning. One can't help feel like this is the angriest of their albums, and it works really well through about half of it. If you loved the DT of Images and Words and Metropolis Pt. 2, this will be a shock. It's still better than most other prog-metal albums out there. Worth a listen to, if not just for the always impressive Petrucci and Portnoy.More like 3.5/5"
5,Here we go again...,"...whenever an asinine 1-star review is posted, it shall be neutralized, and then some. Those are the rules, peeps."
1,0 stars- i agree,"What can I say about this 'homage' that has not already been said? A total waste of time and talent is my opinion, they are akin to Genesis taking a break during 'The lamb..' and instead of looking ahead and trying something new, taking a break and doing an 'homage' to 60's soul music... Glas that DID NOT happen to Genesis, but DT seemed to have taken it upon themselves to be a 80s thrash metal band here for a CD. Do I actually hear the song 'Blackened' from Metallica's '88 album '..and justice for all' in there..I do! 'As I am' is DTs 'Enter sandman' and 'Stream of conciousness' is their 'Orion'. Oh dear, oh dear... SUCH a phenomenal waste of talent, energy and time. The MOST shocking thing to me is that most fans dont see it, but I guess most of them are the ones too young to ever see Metallica when they were not a pop band. I LOVE DT, especially 'Images and words', 'Six degrees..' and 'Metropolis2' but this is not the right way for them to go. Sure I made a few enemies now.."
2,What is this???????????,"Ok- I have been overseas for a long time- (NAVY) When I left- I was a huge Dream Theater fan- I came back two months ago- and I couldnt believe my ears- This is Dream Theater? What happened? I should give this 1 star, but I'm such a fan- I just expected better than this!!!"
1,this constitues as prog? how?!?!?!?!?!?!,Someone please explain to me how this is prog music- to me it sounds to me like prog poop!! DO NOT BUY
1,please!!!!,"Well... If I want to listen Nevermore or Pantera I buy a Nevermore's or Pantera's CD, but when I want Dream Theater, I buy a Dream Theater's CD... Is a god albun, but it isn't Dream Theater... Comparate this Whit WDADU, Images And Words or Scenes From A Memory is like an Ant Fighting a Lion! KEVIN MOORE COME BACK!!!!!!!!!!! I love Dream Theater, but this album is for me the biggest disappointment in prog music. It's definetely their worst studio album. It's monotonous, repeating, with interjected John's solos which are technically perfect, but not captivating. I also miss Jordan's keyboards and Mike's typical drums. It seems to me that they lost invention, they repeat the parts from their previous albums (especially mid part of ""This Dying Soul"" is pure copy of ""Glass Prison""), but this I wouldn't mind the most. The worst is that the whole album reminds me of Metallica, at first I didn't want to admit it, but it's a matter of fact. I hope that they won't go this way."
1,the end 2,"I agree completely with Eddie's review called ""the end"". Since ACOS, not even SFAM has been good in my opinion. SFAM pretended clearly to be an apology for that disaster that was FII. But even its lyrics are the poorest romantic literature. From then on, concert, video and the newest studio albums, terrible. And as I said in a previous review, I came to relate this new DT with MP. He does everything.Sad, really sad. WDADU, Awake, IAW and ACOS were excellent because they were composed, thought, planed, corrected, not jammed."
1,What a waste....,"If I could rate this album a zero or below I certainly would. I was not impressed with this album at all, because these guys could do so much better than this. Right from the start, ""As I Am"" seems to be an attempt at a single and getting nu-metal mallgoths into Dream Theater, and this is so not like them. I burnt this album off Best Buy Rhapsody, and it was free since it was my first burn, but man....what a waste of a perfect, blank, unused CD-R. I'm SO glad I DIDN'T have to pay for this piece of garbage. The songs are just not interesting. The music SOUNDS good, but it just does not have that special stuff that Dream Theater have always brought to their previous albums. I was not interested and quite angry at what these guys ""accomplished."" IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not buy this album, if you think you may like it then do yourself a favor and burn it from someone else. Although you may of course find it to be a waste of a blank CD-R, so try to get a rewritable."
2,Down moment of DT,"I saw it in the stores and bought it at first sight, after listenning to it, I felt I was ""stolen"", it's by far, the weakest album from them, the tracks looks lost in a non-melodies songs (even their fist hit), should be the ""unispired"" moment every band suffer through, if you are a fan of DT, avoid this one or borrow from a friend, it is not worth to buy it, in my opinion, there are only 4 ""classic albuns"": Images and Words, Awake, Falling Into Infinity and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (disc 2)...."
2,Not Progressive Rock - don't be fooled,"I have been exposed to Dream Theatre via Transatlantic and Keith Emerson's opinions on Jordan Rudess. Saw them back up ELP in 1998 (Forgetable). I am a long time Progressive rock fan, ELP, Yes, Genesis, KC, Marillion, you name it. This is not and I repeat NOT progressive rock. It is just Metal and nothing else. I was so disappointed when purchasing this album, so much so that this is the first review of any album I have ever bought (over 400). Anyone who calls this or anything by this band progressive should be shot. Metal is not progressive. I loved the work Portnoy did with Transatlantic and I am not denying the incredible musicianship of Dream Theatre, but this is metal and nothing but. A waste of money for any progressive rock fan. I rate this album 2 stars only because there are great musicians at work(?)here."
1,Oh No!,"Let me first say... I love DT, but for the first time....this is boring.What happend to the great melodies in ""Six degrees...""?What happend to the arrangments from ""Metropolis part 2""?Dream Theater goes Scorpions."
3,Needs a few adjustments and it'll be great,"I agree with others that this album definitely is not up to DT par, but it has potential. They simply need to take out the moments where it gets lame, like the rapping section on the 4th track, or the lame keyboard/techno sounds on tracks 4 and 7. If you could just eliminate these small parts, it would make the album much better. The only track I must say is truly unbelievable is the instrumental piece called, ""Stream of Conciousness."" This track has the old fashioned formula that has worked in the past: odd time, various groove sections, solos by each member, and NO LAME KEYBOARD OR VOCALS. I think in order for this band to succeed, they have got to stick to what has worked in the past. Train of Thought to me was more of an experiment in the realms of metal. This somewhat failure may actually help them learn and grow from their mistakes and help produce future masterpieces."
1,so disappointing,"Dream Theater have been my gods of music for a long time now, and still continue to be. but only because of their older stuff. i wanted to love this album so badly, but after listening to it a bunch of times i just couldnt. all in all a complete disappointment. put your money to something good like their New York concert."
1,For True DT fans-- HORRIBLE,"The only song that is good on this album is Stream of COnsciousness- and coincidence- no Labrie singing? LOW POINT OF DT's career- Petrucci's worst- least innovative solos- just 32nd notes up and down, up and down- BLAH!!!! 1 good song- ST just looking to make a quick buck here- IF YOUR NEW TO DT- BUY IMAGES IN WORDS- OR SCENES FORM A MEMORY! NOT THIS!"
2,high hopes...,"i will agree with all the people above who actually mentioned that this album is way below my expectations! and since i'm more like a progressive fan rather than a metall fan, i find this album sounding very ""hard"". i believe that having a great album out every year, while you are not frank zappa, is VERY difficult to do. maybe they should take a rest and get some fresh ideas in order to achieve something near (the unachievable for me) Mp2:SFAM!"
3,The Beginning of The Decline,"Ever since Kevin Moore left DT has been getting a little worse each album they put out. I really liked Metropolis part 2, but that's the only exception for me. The records at this point are starting to get heavier and more pissed off sounding. I'm not really pissed off about very much, so it's hard for me to relate and get into this stuff. The musicianship on this album is really good, and the songs aren't too bad, but the best DT music is long passed and it only gets worse at this point."
3,Foward but not Progressive,"There are some good songs on this recording, but who's songs are they. It's like Godsmack made some good songs that sounded like Alice in Chains & Metallica when these groups weren't at their best. But to jump on the Alt -Rock train, I'm not sure if that is a progressive move. I guess it takes too much effort to come up with some new. Maybe they are tired of being Dream Theater and want to be Tool for a while."
4,dream theater r dream theater,"Lets face it , dt hav earnt the right to do exactly what they want and how they want whenever they want !! Sure they won't satisfy everyone but lets face it, they do what they do for themselves first and foremost !!! All the little pimply headed wannabe's r just gonna hav to keep practising day after day to reach their level ?? DT kick some serious arse... James legendlabrie """" .."
1,haha,I dont even know if i like prog anymore- i agree with some of these reviews- but i think its even worse. The fact that its DT makes it cccrrraaappppyyyyy
1,"No, no NO!!!!",I WISH DT WOULD READ THESE REVIEWS- THEN MAYBE THEIR ALBUMS WOULDNT BE SO BAD ANYMORE- ATTENTION DT- YOU ARE A PROG BAND- STAY TRUE TO YOUR FANS- YOUR FANS ARE WHY YOU EVEN FREAKIN EXIST- PLEASE THEM- NOT YOURSELVES!!!!
1,LOL,be prepared to defend octavarium- or whatever that stup[id album is called- if it sucks- of course- if its like scenes then you shoudnt have to defend-- haha
1,No big deal,"If you wanna listen virtuoso musicians than can WRITE SONGS instead of indulging themselves, listen RUSH. Skip Dream Theater."
1,PLEASE HELP ME !,help me please ! i'm egyptian and the cd is not sold right here ! so i only can download it ! i need the timing of each track and if possible its size ! cauz there is a fake train of thought published on the net !if anybody knows a way to download the tracks also please tell me ! thank you..
3,not quite up to their usual standard,"I only discovered DT one and a half years ago, but since then I've been hooked on their albums. So, after waiting patiently for the new album, it was truly disappointing. This is really the album Metallica should have written instead of St Anger. From DT I expected much more. I don't think they've used even half of their talents in producing it, and the result shows. Most of the time it is nothing more than a bunch of heavy chops lumped together, instead of interesting riffs. Petrucci seems to be trying to break the record for the fastest guitarist ever, but he seems to have missed musical creativity in the effort. Myung's baselines aren't as interesting as in previous albums. ToT represents a couple of steps back in their musical career, especially after producing two excellent albums like Awake and 6DOIT. Anyway, even a lame DT thing like this has it's heap of good moments. Only that it's not worth paying 20 for it. Just burn it from a friend"
1,No dreams,"IMO, after ACOS nothing has worked for DT. It is as if that insult that was FII had pressed them to try to fix it pretending to please their progressive fans. But being classified as progressive (or as anything) should be the result of songwriting, not the purpose. That is why their songs are long, boring, fast but soulless. A song must be composed to sound well (a definition that is left up to the reader), not to comply with rigid schemes."
3,This is AVG prog,"If you want to listen to good progressive music, check out these insane titles instead of this CD-Porcupine Tree, DeadwingAdagio- any of their two albumsSymphony X- may I reccomend VTiles- Window Dressing (if you like Rush, get this band!)Opeth, Damnation"
2,a slight improvement from their previous release,"still their new release is awful... this shows how bad 6doit is! dream theater has become a shadow of their former selves. dream theater is not a thrash or industrial sounding band, so they should stop pretending they are one and write the kind of music they are best at (like those on i&w, awake). james labrie has gotten so annoying on the vocals, and he should stop trying to sound like hetfield. too bad another band has gone down the drain!"
1,BAD- HORRID- NASTY- prog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"read the reviews of this album on progarchives.com- this 5 star reviwer is either drunk, or this is the only DT album he owns- do not listen to him- or her"
1,Why??!!,"DT is my favorite band and the epitome of prog rock today. But this CD is disappointing. The lyrics are angry, which is okay if it is cohesive like the 2nd CD of Six Degrees). DT has always been melodic, challenging and awe inspiring. Most of the album is derivitive of nu-metal. Very little melody, muddy sound, too much use of ""telephone"" voice, intricate guitar parts are extremely self indulgent and lacking soul. <sigh>"
2,Dream Theater Goes Nu-Metal,"D.T. have been on a downward spiral for sometime, but Train Of Thought is a new low. This is not something I say lightly. I've been a fan since Images And Words, but when I hear Linkin Park style rap on a Dream Theater CD something is wrong! And it's not just the rapping, it's the muddy sound, lack of melody and juvenile ""angry"" lyrics."
1,Where did their sense of art go ?!,"I have listened DT since IAW came out, and I have all album they've made. ToT is just a bunch of guys showing off their skills. Compared to IAW & SFAM, they are losing their sense of art."
1,I agree,"see below- i was thinking about doing that lol- try symphony x- or adagio, redemption, pagan's mind- stay clear of this ""prog"" album-- haha"
1,NO,A disapointment after such classics as Scenes From a Memory and Images And Words. DT have almost abandoned their prog metal on train of thought. 10min + songs with below standard riffs and emotionless solos.
2,Unremarkable,"I'm going to be brief here. Compared to ""Images and Words"" or ""Metropolis : Scenes from a Memory"" or the first disc of ""Six Degrees..."", this album is very unremarkable. Seriously, what's the point? After listening to the album through multiple times, it's just very uninspiring and lackluster. Boring, even. Nothing is worth listening to, and it just goes on and on....There isn't one song that ever screams, ""Listen to meee !!!!"" Nope. And then one might think, ""Well, it must be an album experience then?"" Nope. Just annoying and useless.2 stars."
2,Get back to the art of SONGwriting,"Since Images and Words, DT has progressively (pun intended) put more and more emphasis on chops and the expense of songs. What made Images & Words and Awake so great was that they had these incredible instrumental passages *within* great songs. But no longer. Now the ""songs"" are just excuses to go wheedlywheedlywheedly at blazing fast speeds. Too bad."
2,Boring as hell.........,"All members of this band are extremely talented musicians, but that doesn't necessarily mean they can write a GREAT song. At least, not on this album. The first two songs conjure up familiar riffs from other heavy bands and just twist them into 10-12 minute snooze fests...random guitar pyro, killer drumming but just DERIVATIVE and Loooong...almost just for the sake of being long. Check out Images and Words for true brilliance and catchiness.........also, the new kings of progressive metal with MEANING? Do yourself a favor and pick up KAMELOT'S: THE BLACK HALO....the singing and musicianship and songwriting put Dream Theater and all others in a sea of mediocrity."
3,"If you wanna take a nap, buy this album...","I've always loved dream theater, for there progressive music thats always entertaining. This album does not match up to anything previous in my opnion. 'As I Am' is the only song I really like on this album. They have less prog. influence on this album, its just not the dream theater ive come to know.. A mediocore album."
3,"Please, make Portnoy stop writing","I will say this again, as I've said before:Portnoy's lyrics are horrible. Dreadful. Obviously he's STILL writing to fill the void left by Kevin Moore, who is surely missed - at the very least in the lyrical department.I agree with most of the reviewers that outline the overall ""lack"" that this CD has - melody, cohesiveness, etc. And it's sad. Apparently they peaked at ""Awake"" ... the last song that was a true masterpiece was ""Scarred"" ... though ""Trial of Tears"" (off, yes, FII) is great in it's own right.I'm giving them one last shot before they drop off the must-buy on release day list. Please don't let me down again, DT. Take some time, recharge the batteries, and get back to writing some musical AND lyrical classics once again."
5,A terrific album,"Train of thought is one of the greatest albums from DT.This album features some of the best prog rock music like As I am,Endless sacrifice and Stream of consciousness.This album is superb and is highly recommended."
3,Good album,Ok dream theater nalbum. This album takes a different approach from previous albums and they are beginning to experiment with different writing styles. Worthy buy.
3,??????????????????????,I dont know if the guys were thinking when doing this album or at least some of its songs. Probably the only great outstanding song is As I Am. on The Dying Soul they have taken out chunks of some old songs including the Glass Prison. and they have also added some unnecessary nu-metal crap which totally destrys the impression after the first song. everything else on the album is average and im extremely dissapointed in such a great band.
2,can't believe this.,"i really cant believe that the guys that have made masterpieces such as ''images & words'' and ''change of seasons'' have come with this album, i though that 6DOIT was a bad album, but this one is even worst. this album dont have any kind of emotion on the songs, and a lot o people are only saying ''its heavy, its heavy'' so what? metalica's st anger is heavy and still is a big crap so heavyness is nothing that makes an album good or bad.they are just not taking the time to make the songs."
5,One of my favorites,"I see that there are a lot of people that don't like this CD. I've been listening to DT for about 6 months now and I think they're one of the best bands to ever come togeather. I've listened to their old stuff, and I've listened to there new stuff. I think this CD is just as good as any of there other CD's. Then again I love just about any rock or metal CD you can throw at me. I think DT had something to get out of there systems, and they did it on this CD. There is a ton of very cathy heavy riffs, especially in ""Honor Thy Father"" its a pretty nice song but gets a little reapeatative. But it's not like the whole cd is heavy. ""Vacant"" is a pretty slow song, and ""In the Name of God"" is slow mostly twards the end.So the bottom line is - If you like old DT, and like heavy stuff as well, then you'll probly enjoy this. otherwise, you might just want to stick with the old stuff."
1,NO DT,"What can I say about this 'homage' that has not already been said? A total waste of time and talent is my opinion, they are akin to Genesis taking a break during 'The lamb..' and instead of looking ahead and trying something new, taking a break and doing an 'homage' to 60's soul music... Glas that DID NOT happen to Genesis, but DT seemed to have taken it upon themselves to be a 80s thrash metal band here for a CD. Do I actually hear the song 'Blackened' from Metallica's '88 album '..and justice for all' in there..I do! 'As I am' is DTs 'Enter sandman' and 'Stream of conciousness' is their 'Orion'. Oh dear, oh dear... SUCH a phenomenal waste of talent, energy and time. The MOST shocking thing to me is that most fans dont see it, but I guess most of them are the ones too young to ever see Metallica when they were not a pop band. I LOVE DT, especially 'Images and words', 'Six degrees..' and 'Metropolis2' but this is not the right way for them to go. Sure I made a few enemies now.."
4,Singles of Diorama,"If you liked the album Diorama and take interest in Silverchair as a band, you`ll like this. The great songs from the album, and the bands comment on the work with the album and additional previously unreleased tracks (like the great ""pins in my needles"") makes this full value for money.Additional to this singles box I recommend the DVD Emotion Pictures- if you`re a fan that is.Jon"
2,Not good for old eyes,This is a reprint of the original. It is a complete volumn and I would rate it 5 stars except.....When the book was reprinted the type size is the equivilent of a 8 or 10 point type at best. Even though the book is full size and the pages are full size the printed area only covers about 1/4 to 1/3 of the page. The illustrations are reduced to a single page unlike the original and are very faint.If you don't have 20/20 eyesight of an eighteen year old this book will be very hard to read.For the reasoning of readability I rate it so low. I unfortunately will be returning my copy.
4,Not A Gingerbread Man,"These do taste very good. However, they are not gingerbread men as you would expect from the picture. They are medium/large round cookies. In that respect I was disappointed because I wanted to give my kids Gingerbread Men for Christmas."
2,I See They've Changed The Picture.,"I see they've changed the product picture so they appropriately look like plain round cookies. The picture that was up when I bought them made them look like gingerbread boys, so when I got them and saw them I was disappointed. I was going to have my granddaughter help me decorate the gingerbread boys. I ate one and it tasted pretty good, but left a long, foul aftertaste in my mouth. I wouldn't order them again."
2,disappointed,"I received this as a gift. The bracelet is dainty. The sapphires are a dark blue, but the luster is ok. The quality of the diamonds do not meet all the specifications advertised. I can see black spots on several of the diamonds on my bracelet. They are more of an I than SI. I'd return this if it wasn't a gift. If I had known the quality would be below what was advertised, I would have asked for jewelry from costco. I will not be buying jewelry from amazon again without a certificate."
3,Look at what Detroit has become..,"70 years after the government began its myriad programs of forced racial intergration, affirmative action and progressive communist policies, we can see WHY the White working class, circa 40s Detroit, bitterly resisted the racial totalitarianism which has brought White Christian America to her knees. I don't think America will ever revive, much less Detroit. Its looking more like ruins each decade that passes."
5,It really worked for my baby!,"My mom bought this CD for me because I was having so much trouble getting my baby to fall asleep. Even with rocking and singing it would take him a long time to fall asleep, and he would get so overtired that much of that time would be spent crying. I rolled my eyes at the idea of a CD called ""Sleepy Baby"" and that that was supposed to solve my problem, but I was so exhausted that I was willing to try anything. Wow, was I wrong! Within a minute or so of turning on this music, my baby calms way down. He stops wiggling and fussing and starts to look zoned out. He often falls asleep before the first song is over - no matter which song I start on - and even if he doesn't, he is at least quiet and calm. If I play this CD when he starts looking tired, he never gets to the point of being overtired and screaming. He just calms down until he quietly falls asleep. What a relief!"
4,This cd is ok,"I don't see how it is really sleepy time music, it never lulled my baby to sleep. But it is really pretty to listen to or to have as just background music when trying to calm your child when starting your night routine."
2,Nice music but it did not work on my baby,"I think the music on this CD is simply nice slow music. But to be honest, it did not put my baby to sleep. In fact, I gave Sleepy baby to a friend and it did not work on their 2 year old either. But I will say that it's nice music and maybe should be marketed as a relaxation CD."
1,It just did not work !,I would assume that a CD entitled Sleepybaby would put a baby to bed. Well this one kept her up and was not effective. I went to www.themozarteffect.com to complain and found out that there is another CD called Music for babies that really does work.It is by a man named Don Cambell
2,Impossible goal,"Naturally, every song on this album is incredible. After all, it is Pantera. However, putting together a ""greatest hits"" album with such a limited amount of tracks was an impossible mission to complete.Every Pantera album is nearly immaculate and it is too hard to say which is best because they are all slightly different. While this album has some good songs on it, every Pantera fan would be less than pleased with it. It is lacking too many awesome songs that every fan would agree are worthy of ""best of"" status. If you are truely satisfied with calling this album ""Panters's greatest"", then you simply dont appreciate Pantera that much. Spend the extra money and buy yourself thier albums. Every one of them should be in the record books as some of the best metal albums ever."
2,"Awsome band, mediocore album","This is one of my favorite bands ever. It is a shame that these are the only songs that are called thier ""greatest hits"". I could go on and on about what songs should be on here in my opinion but that could be forever like where is F@#king Hostile? Which leads me to something else that is irratating me.A lot of people are on here are talking about how bad Pantera was and calling them Panterible. IF YOU HATE THIS BAND SO MUCH THEN WHY ARE YOU RATING THIS C.D?!!! You rate C.D.s based on how you think it reflects the bands ability and how good it was produced. You don't use this rating system to judge a band or artist. Do you see me rating 50 Cent's new C.D. only to talk about how much I hate his music. NO! That is what blogs are for!!!R.I.P Dime"
4,I'm Here to Direct You to REINVENTING HELL,"I have seen the Reviews for this CD here, Many are frustrated that this Set leans too Heavy on the Later years while ignoring a Few Earlier Gems...I Agree, but there is a Solution to that Problem: There is an Austrailian Import Version of this CD available, Titled ""Reinventing Hell: The Best of"" , I have it, and it is The Greatest Metal CD One Can own! The Pointless Nugent Cover here (better done by Ted) is absent on Reinventing Hell, but Present are 2 Early Scorchers ""Fu***ing Hostile"" and ""Domination"", Dimebag's been Gone a Year from last night, Reinventing Hell displays the Pulverizing Licks that can always be Ours to Treasure....SEEK OUT REINVENTING HELL"
3,well...,"If you are already a pantera fan there shouldnt be anything new here for you, but a good collection of tracks for people unfamiliar with pantera.buy it now and give it to that linkin park fan you know."
4,Best of Pantera,"Perfect title for this album, could have a few more songs but it was made up for with the bonus dvd."
4,Buy it for the bonus DVD,"From the greatest heavy metal band of all time, comes Reinventing Hell:The best of Pantera. However, I don't believe that this is actually the 'best of' Pantera, there are a lot better songs out there by the band. These songs just being the best of the commercially released singles. I would suggest buying the entire catalogue of Pantera albums if you don't already own them and get right into their music. For all fans, this is more of a worthwhile purchase for the bonus DVD, which features 10 music videos plus a couple of live bonus tracks, it is worth the money for the DVD alone. It also includes a 14 page colour booklet with pictures and a brief timeline and bio of the band. A good summary of a long successful career."
3,Good idea...,"Not really the greatest collection of songs by Pantera in my opinion. The first half of the cd is actually killer, ""Cowboys from Hell"" is the perfect song to start of this cd. I'm really disapointed that there wasn't more tracks from ""The Great Southern Trendkill"", ""Floods"" is my personal favorite Pantera song and thought it should've been included. I get lots of use out of the DVD though, all and all its worth the price."
3,i dunno,"according to live 101, suicide note 2 was ""their hit""...at the pantera shows i've been to that song got the biggest pop....hell even at the down show i was at there was chants for it....can't figure out why it wasn't included, along with other songs mentioned in the other reviews....phil's my boy, but i dunno what the deal is on this one"
5,"Yup, very good indeed!!","What can I say that the others haven't said already. If you love Pantera and have all or most of their cd's, why would you buy this one?. Well because it rocks and is a must have. Like one reviewer said, a great way to say goodbye. Buy it and remember what a great band they were. The bonus DVD is also a cool feature."
3,2 very rare must have tracks!,same as far beyond great southern cowboys vulgar hits buy the late 2 tracks 15-16 immortally insane and the badge are heavy tracks are very rare from movie soundtrack but on FBGSCVH(track 12 cat scracth fever-16 hole in the sky are great too.but very much the same tracks best of great but lets face it your buying it for the bonus track anyway right buy both cheap!
2,whatever,"f****** hostile is one of their most known songs and their record company didnt put it on it.... bs. Use My 3rd Arm needs to be on there as well. All in all pantera had a great run, but everything must come to a end."
4,COME ON EVERYONE,"I don't care what anyone says. This is pretty much all Pantera has to offer, spaning there short and very successfull career. They came in the same way they left. Unlike groups like Metallica or Megadeth they never changed. In some ways thats honorable and in some ways thats stupid (Evolve your music in accordance to whats hot and fresh). And if you think I'm just some idot. Just turn on your radio and tune it in to your local hard rock station and listen to whats being played(Excluding TEXAS of course).Buy it for the slightly inhanced sound. Then bring it home, pop into your cd deck, and unleash the beast. I also recomend Cowboys From Hell specifically for the non live version of Primal Concrete Sledge.The DVD is nothing in comparison to Rob Zombie's, but the visuals bring energy to the table that the sound doesnt. Kind of intimidating in my opinion."
2,"No es ""The Best of Pantera"" que yo esperaba!!!!!!!","No es un mal disco pero tampoco es verdaderamente lo mejor de Pantera. Si quieren lo mejor de este grupo compren sus primeros 2 CD'S!!! Especialmente ""COWBOYS FROM HELL"". Pienso que este ha sido su mejor trabajo!. ""THE BEST OF"" solo ofrece dos canciones de ""cowboys"" y deja afuera favoritas como ""PRIMAL CONCRETE SLEDGE"" Y ""PSYCO HOLIDAY"" de su primera producción ""COWBOYS FROM HELL"". Aparte de esto, aparecen muchas canciones del disco ""REINVENTING THE STEEL"" (que en mi opinión no son muy buenas) y mi favorita de ese CD, ""HELL BOUND"" no esta incluida. Por el lado positivo incluye 2 canciones que originalmente habian salido en recopilaciones con varios artistas. ""PLANET CARAVAN"" (De Nativity In Black) y ""Cat scratch Fever"" (De el soundtrack de Detroit Rock City) que son bastante buenas! (aunque no el estilo de pantera). Mi recomendación seria comprar ""COWBOYS FROM HELL"" y tal ves ""VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER"" en ves de ""THE BEST OF""."
3,Totally Freakin' Dissapointed,"#1. Where is The Badge? #2 Use my third arm and good friends and a bottle of pills not on the C.d. #3 Wher eis domination? #4 Wher e is Floods, Suicide note 1&2, sandblasted skin, and underground in america? #5 Except forrevolution is my nmae And yesterday don't mean s''t reinventing the steel sucked. #6 How about some actual live songs ( cold gin maybe) #7 These are radio hits, and if u r gonna include covers where is cold gin or electric funeral these covers suck. #8 LAST BUT NOT LEAST WHO IS THE IDIOT WHO SAID "" HEY MAN WE DON'T NEED TO PUT F''CKING HOSTILE ON THE GREATEST HITS C..D..?people stick with superjoint and down-pantera has oficially sold out"
3,I want more,"I got this cd because i like pantera, but didnt want to buy a lot of their cds also because it came with a dvd. It kinda did the opposite because now i want to get their other albums. Some of the tracks such as the covers of planet caravan and cat scratch fever seem kinda out of place on a greatest hits, planet caravan sounds EXACTLY like the original and just takes up space. I would NOT recomend this to anyone new to pantera because you will probably end up wanting to get their other cds. Kinda a waste of 15 bucks because i'm going to order vulgar display of power and cowboys from hell now"
3,What about the first four?,"Greatest hits packages are typically what you get from your grandmother. True fans don't own things like this and Pantera is a band that doesn't really have hits. The biggest problem I have though with this collection and with one of my favorite bands, is the complete lack of songs from their first four albums. Metal Magic, Projects In The Jungle, I Am The Night and Power Metal are always totally ignored by this band. Power Metal is where Phil finally entered and all four albums have musical ranges from Judas Priest to Poison to Pantera as most people think of them. These four albums contain some of the catchiest and best songs in Pantera's catalog and should be re-issued on CD and included in any future compilation release from the band. Don't ignore or be ashamed of the past. Let us see the full development of the band and it's music."
3,Not as good as her debut,"The storyline was okay, albeit a bit far-fetched. The main problem is that the writing was tedious. It appeared as if the writed was herself bored as she wrote the story. I liked the Maiden's Revenge, so Hillary, try replicating your debut novel."
5,Great tray,"I'm very pleased with the quality of this tray for the price. Well-made and seems more substantial than some of the wooden trays I've seen at discount stores. Henckels is a great brand and this product only adds to their reputation. My newOneida Flambe 45-Piece Stainless Steel Flatware Set, Service for 8looks great in it!"
4,"Good, basic tray, if a little bland","Well, it's a flatware tray. It's a pretty standard size and should fit in your drawer, and you shouldn't have any problem fitting your utensils in as long as you don't have any oversized serving spoons, etc. It was quite a bit larger than I expected, but that's not a bad thing. The construction is sturdy (actually pretty heavy for wood tray) but aside from that, there's not much here. I gave it four stars, only because it's pretty bland. Yes, it's a flatware tray, but it's also 12 bucks. I saw a slightly cheaper mesh metal tray here on Amazon, and that had a bit more character to it (although the metal would probably be a bit more abrasive on the utensils.) Just something to consider. It gets the job done, but it'd be more worth the money if it was stained or painted black or something. Other than that, it's a fine product.The bottom line:- Large, sturdy, quality flatware tray.- A bit bland for the price, but still worth it."
2,Flatware Tray,"The tray is nice. I wish it were a tad longer. It always slips towards the back of the drawer when opened. Not that much but still. It also could be a bit deeper to hold more flatware. For a place setting of 4 knife, fork, soup spoon, and teaspoon it will be fine. But (2) 4 piece settings of the same it just about overflows."
4,Nice Size,"This fits perfectly into my old ""kitchen junk drawer"" and now organizes my serving pieces and knives. Nice piece, would recommend"
4,Oooops,Tray was what we expected however it arrived with two split panels -manufacturing flaws- that were obscured by the packaging. Fortunately we were able to repair the cracks in the wood with glue and clamps avoiding the need for a return. Changes in the assembly process are required to prefent similar occurrences.
4,Reviewed by ex-subordinate of the author.,"I have read this book from cover to cover. Roy Carruth offers an excellent perspective on different tactics involving leadership and motivation. He also incorporates several years of experience and first hand knowledge in his writings. He is very ""down to earth"" and conveys his views on Leadership and Motivation in a manner in which all can comprehend and understand! In addition to the above, I have had the pleasure of having this author as my supervisor when he was in the criminal justice system and contribute a large portion of my success to his supervisory skills. Simply put, the man was a walking moral booster and an excellent leader. Roy Carruth has been away from the criminal justice sytem for several years now, and to this date, everytime I teach a class on Principles of Supervision and ask for an example of a great leader and motivational person, those who worked with him always bring up his name!"
4,I just couldn't put it down,"This was the first time I've read Yoshimoto's work and I'm really impressed. Not so much because of the storyline or anything like that, but I just couldn't put it down. Banana Yoshimoto writes in such a way that captivates anyone who's willing to take time to read her work.She deals with very deep subjects in ""NP"" without getting too heavy and depressing...she has such a simplicity that makes you more and more interested. Read it!"
1,First and LAST Yoshimoto book I will ever read,"Throughout the story, characters talk about the powerful and touching nature of the 98th story so much that the reader can't help but feel jealous -- if that story is so transforming, why am I reading this melodramatic piece of drivel? Dialog is flat, narration is trite (more than once the narrator describes another character as ""someone I could really talk to""), and the characters are melodramatic and self-absorbed. Plus, the author feels the need to provide a note at the end of the book explaining the character of Sui -- Doesn't Yoshimoto know by now that a good author shouldn't have to explain her characters? Their actions and dialogues should explain themselves! I picked up this book because of all the positive reviews that Yoshimoto and her earlier book received. But this is the first and last Yoshimoto book that I will read."
2,'Hello Kitty' w/ a pinch of incest,"I don't know whether it's the way Yoshimoto writes or if the book loses something in the translation, but this novel seems to seriously lack depth.The dialogues all seem so contrived/staged -- very matter of fact -- kind of unusual for a book that deals w/ themes like incest and suicide. Too cute and terribly annoying."
2,Leisure Reading,"Easy to read, quite interesting, good for leisure reading, positive, and yet not arresting, somehow too simple to be remembered.I read the English translation. Perhaps it misses the freshness of Yoshimoto's simplicity of expression. Anyway, in English, it is too plain.There is nothing wrong with simplicity, though. Good literature does not have to be ""deep"" or ""complicated"". This is a good read. But, still, it lack the kind of appeal and power that one would feel reading a great book. It is a pleasure to read this book, but one could hardly make much out of it.By the way, it reminds me of Fumiko Enchi's ""Masks"", the same kind of spiritual possession."
3,A SATISFACTORY EFFORT;BUT KITCHEN OUTWEIGHED IT BY FAR,"AFTER HAVING READ KITCHEN IN ONE SITTING AND HAVING THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT I WAS KEEN ON READING HER OTHER BOOKS. YET UNFORTUNATELY, NP LACKED THE GRIP AND EMOTION OF KITCHEN AND FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON IRRELEVANT ISSUES.I'LL STILL READ HER OTHER NOVELS BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE."
3,Something oddly addictive about Yoshimoto...,"Having devoured Huraki Murakami, Yoshimoto seemed like the next progressive step.And really, they do have some similarities. There is something beautifully refreshing about their aloof, sweet descriptive style and their covert intellectualism.However, Yoshimoto's works seem to lack a certain something, a certain zest or life. While they are compulsively addictive, they tread so lightly as to be almost unmemorable.'Y.P' is certainly less impressive than her tiny bestseller 'Kitchen'. In both works, there seems to be a lovely layer of foggy glass between the reader and the characters, yet in 'Y.P', this is tainted by a sense of distachment from the work.I found myself liking the book, enjoying the descriptions and the complexity of the characters, but not really caring about the outcome.'Kitchen' is undoubtedly the better read."
3,Good read but a bit dry,"N.P. was the first novel I've read by Yoshimoto. I was not so captivated by it because it seemed too dry. The characters, except for perhaps Sui, are all very dense, including the narrator, Kazami. The plot is a bit scattered, and the speech is a bit difficult to follow. However, it is interesting and worth while to the open minded. Her metaphors are enchanting and the symbolism of the environment and events are easy to catch. I think Banana would make a great poet, as I've heard others say before. But she is young and future novels by her should tend to only get better. I'm still willing to read her _Kitchen_, which I heard was 10x better than _N.P._ I think Yoshimoto summed it up best herself, to read this book: ""On a sunny November afternoon, with a cold, eating a persimmon."" To spend much more time on it would be wasteful."
1,"Dull, Peculiar, Sexist","A father has incest with his daughter, writes a story about it, ultimately kills himself. The daughter has an affair with the man who is translating the story -- the translator kills himself. The daughter then has an affair with her brother, the son of the writer. The daughter becomes pregnant by her brother, flubs a suicide attempt, then disappears, much to the relief of the brother and the story's narrator (a second translator of the story who had an affair with the first translator . . .). The brother and the narrator travel to the beach, and there is the suggestion that they will now live happily ever after because the messy sister is now out of their hair.Socially retarded & best avoided."
3,Good for Lopez aficionados,"This book is good for fans of Lopez, who want to know more about him personally. I found it an eclectic collection of writing, some on journeys to places, some on appreciating crafts, some on Lopez's adventures in fast cars as a young man. I appreciated the travel writing, especially about the islands of Bonaire, Hokkaido, and the Galapagos archipelago. Overall, the writing is very rich, and too poetic for easy reading. I personally prefer his other writing, which usually has a more outward focus on other people and external environments."
5,Lopez is the champion storyteller,"In an era where American storytelling is all but dead, Lopez may be the resurrection. Lopez gives us his sketches about life with the precision of a master craftsman but with the story telling skills of my grandmother. All essays are compelling, and the only disappointing moment is when the reader realizes that he or she is on the last page."
2,Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed with this product. The mp3 cds play fine, but my burned cds wont play! It was made me so angry with this product! If someone knows if I can do anything to fix this problem, please tell me, but otherwise I do not recommend this product to anyone."
3,"GREAT QUALITY, But...","i have owned this product for longer then I ould guess most of these reviewers have, and like most of them, I saw the good reviews and the cheap price and I bought it. The first problem I had was batteries. It only takes rechargibles. And I need strong ones since I was going on a five-hour plane ride. It cost me about ten more dollars. so really at the price I could have gotten a much better CD player. I have recently found out about how great it is that it can play MP3 CDs, which really adds to make this a really high-quality CD player.The sound is great, it is very durable, and other then recent problems it is very good."
1,Hmmm...,"First of all. I was looking for the best CD/MP3 player out there. I came up to this (because this was the one that the worker there said was the best)... I checked it out, and I was happy that it had easy navigation but the bad stuff about it is that it is slow at changing songs.... There is no controller!!! and finally there is no light! How are you going to tell which songs or albums you wanna play next?!?!?!?!?! You gotta use a flashlight or something...... I recommend getting the newest SlimX player, cuz its the best. I bought the Slim X a day after I bought this RCA (really crappy appliance) player. I do not recommned this!!"
1,Disappointing product,"I purchased this product as I was going travelling. I started to use the MP3 player in late June. By early August, it has stopped working. It didn't fall, get water damaged or anything - it just stopped. Wouldn't recommend at all. As I'm currently abroad for 12 months, I have had to replace it at my own expense and am not happy about this."
1,too any problems!,"So many problems with this thing...I bought this specifically to play background music in clubs between band sets. Great idea uh, 150+ songs, put it on shuffle play and it can go for days!!! WRONG!Lets count the problems: Occasional looooong delays between songs, a few songs just cut off and jump to the next (after a LONG pause), It usually shuts down by itself within 30-45 minutes, meaning I have to start it up again. It can take 30-60 seconds to boot up and start playing the first song, and then you have to go into preferences each time and turn shuffle play on. All of these things happen while using the power adapter. Problems grow when trying to run it on batteries.Sounds like a great idea, and using the power adapter, I would expect to have solid, effortless solution to running music for an entire evening. NO WAY! This thing usually can't play for more than 15-20 minutes before having a problem.If it were FREE it wouldn't be worth the effort"
1,Not the greatest book on Christian dating,"This book does offer some helpful advice, but is primarily geared toward younger, dating singles (high school and college). These singles are at the greatest risk of investing too much time into the relationships instead of cultivating the lifeskills they should be developing. I don't agree with Holzmann's take on the ""Brother/sister"" angle. It's true younger singles can find themselves giving too much time and energy to dating instead of building their lives in other areas, but the idea that you can go from being a platonic friend to being engaged (as the author did)is not realistic. The best part of Holzmann's book is on page 167 where he advises readers to develop life habits, how to relate and to ""make even ordinary circumstances extraordinary."""
1,ive read some (...) in my day,"Pentacostal rhetoric. If you date according to this, I suggest you pack it up fast. This book is about 90 years late. If you are Ned Flanders you might find this usefull as well."
3,omnimount stand,These stand are good for the price.Good quality overall.The only thing I didn't like is that they are not so steady on think carpet.
3,Nothing In This Book is True But That Is What Was Written,"That's the feeling I get after reading the whole book. Which part of it is true or the whole book is just plain fantasy stuff?I also realized that some of the ridiculous ideas that people have are perhaps originated from the source for this book. It goes to show how gullible people can be. On the other hand, it goes to show why some people considered Padmasambhava (aka Guru Rinpoche) to be a charlatan. You are encouraged to read also ""Tibetan Buddhism, With Its Mystic Cults, Symbolism and Mythology, and in Its Relation to Indian Buddhism"" (ISBN:0486201309) by Laurence Austin Waddell.If you are going to buy this book, be prepared to think of it like a Marvel comics without pictures but only words ---- pure fantasy."
5,Important Dharma Material,"Lotus-Born is a Dharma book. As such it should be sold and cared for in a proper manner. If you believe that this book is not being sold in a manner consistant with your teaching, please refrain from buying and causing the seller bad karma."
3,santa print,"When I purchased this print I expected the print to be 16x20, it was but had a large border around it making the actual picture much smaller."
5,Classic Love song,This is a classic love song by Joe it is really good and wasa huge hit it went to #4 and was #4 for the year greatLyrics 10/10 Production 10/10 Overall 10/10
3,Nonsense book,Book was not as exspected. Contacted seller and they were willing to refund or exchange. Decided that the black ink markings in this book would be fine since the book is for my five year old daughter.
4,"Lots of info, not many pictures","This book is lovely. Written in a simple and accessible question-answer format, it encompasses all kinds of doubts you may have, even the silliest ones! I specially enjoyed the chronological listing of every mission that has been launched to the moon and planets, which even includes the missions that failed - it's a great way to understand how dangerous, yet fascinating, space travel can be. Unfortunately there are not many colored pictures - the book is printed in simple, even a bit cheap paper, but the inset in the middle of the book is printed in high quality gloss paper that really makes the pictures pop! They are not very big, however; one or two per page. There is also the issue of this being such a chunky book sold as paperback - feels awfully fragile! But it's understandable; the book is meant to stay within reach, both for your mind, and for your wallet! I only wish it had more full-color pictures..."
3,poor mastering,"needs remastering. Does anyone know if the japanese pressing is really remastered? Because many things say remastered, but aren't.I would rate this album a 5 but the mastering (including the original vinyl) is poor."
4,"Witches, Treasure, Romance - Enjoy !","This is great mystery/romance novel based Cape Cod. Clate Jackson moves to Cape Cod on whim after buying an old Cape Cod property. Piper encounters her new neighbor while digging in his flower bed in the middle of night. It is nice mix of romance, mystery and Cope Cod. I would also suggest 'The Ice House' by Minette Walters.Carla Negger has a new book coming out Summer 2005 ~ 'DARK SKY'."
4,Very enjoyable...,This was my first Carla Neggers book & I have to say that I was very delighted. I've already purchased many more of her books & I can't wait to get started. The storyline was great & although I found it just a tiny bit slow to start out with the middle to end of this book sure made up for that. You'll love meeting everyone in this town & you'll be going crazy trying to solve it (I figured it out sooner than I probably should've but...) but that's the whole fun of it right? I would highly recommend this book.
2,Great value; Even better sound deadening; Broke easily,"The price was great, the decibel level dampening was on par with more expensive offerings from other companies, buuut the set broke while I was simply folding the headphones back up to store in my range bag. I was neither roughing the headphones nor i a hurry in putting them away, the holding pin for the left hinge just simply fell out and I was never able to find it on the range's retail floor where I was using them...If only the things stayed together, I would have given this a 5 star rating (ESPECIALLY for the value)."
2,Look elsewhere,"I see I am not the only one to have problems with the pins falling out of the earmuffs. Short of peening the ends over quite violently with a punch and hammer, the refused to stay in. Not the best thing for the muff to fall off while your on the qualification course for the department. Thanks Remingington for making me look like a doof in front of my squad."
1,Quality is poor,"I purchased three of these protectors. The pins holding the muffs to the band all fell out; I used hot melt glue to hold them in. After being used about 20 times, the plastic headband broke on one pair in 75 degree weather. Do not waste money on these."
4,Folds into a compact package.,"A good quality product from a trusted name brand in firearms. Perfect for use on the shooting range, mowing grass, or other high noise situations."
2,vbzzzz,"In a nutshell: crummy. Subwoofer: 0/5. Satellites: 3/5.The subwoofer resonates right in the middle of the bass band, you'd think they'd have done some testing on the box acoustics. I'm surprised it doesn't jump around like an old 15"" paper speaker.All four satellite speakers have silly little runners on the bottom with a wire between - a big wire on the right front, so it doesn't sit level nor stay where you want. I ended up hanging them upside-down like bats.The subwoofer level control has a bad taper. Keep turning, but it doesn't get much softer after 1/4, until the point at which it shuts off completely.The power is on all the time, even with the switch turned off. ""Make this connection last"" is right.. but unplug the wallwart first.The satellites are tight, even though they seem insubstantial. The package would be a 4/5 if the subwoofer didn't have those nasty harmonics."
2,worn out,"Bass has vibration that cannot be fixed. Speakers are lighter than expected and sound is sort of ""tinny"". I have a set of AL stereo speakers with bass that are probably 12 years old now and still sound great. Just wanted to add a rear pair. Will keep using my old ones."
2,It looks cheap,"This molding is cheap, and it looks cheap too. It is not a hand carved or machine carved molding. Actually it is not a carved molding at all. I prefer some thing cost more but looks better."
3,for portuguese & brazilian readers,O livro tem fotografias de todas as faces/ambientes. A parte difícil é voc ver um foto spoiler. No sei se é melhor ler o livro original primeiro e só depois visualizar as fotos ou fazer os dois ao mesmo tempo. Vou tentar a segunda opo; é muito chato quando ao ler o original vc tentar imaginar sem ter alguma direo. Daí esse livro de fotografias entra p/ ajudar na sua imaginao.
4,Beautiful Artwork,"This is a wonderful book, with MANY different artist interpretations of the landscape and characters that play parts in George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series.I have an excellent imagination, but it was (IS!) wonderful to see other people visions of the lives you read about. It certainly helped me in a few places, especially in getting the perspective of a Direwolf to a man.Highly recommended for any big fan of the series. If you LOVE this series you'll greatly enjoy this book. If you just LIKE this series then you may not get as much out of it and it may not be worth the purchase price."
5,Great for the avid fan.,"If you are a loyal fan to the Ice and Fire series, than you will enjoy this collection.A high pecentage of the art was from the Game of Thrones CCG game, so if you have the playing cards, you wont find a whole lot new here. I have seen most of the art online at different fan and artists websites, but to have them all in one format that you can look at anytime is worth the price to me.It is interesting to see the different ways people picture the characters. Some were spot on to what I imagined and some where not even close to what I picture. Either way, it is great reference material and the artwork is fabulous weather your a fan or not."
4,Must have for Westeros fans,"If you love the fantastic series of Ice and Fire half as much as I do, you must buy this beautiful collection of artwork. My only complaint is I want more!!!!"
2,Just another card game...,"Disapointed. From a promising cover, the content goes downhill from there. If I were Mr. Martin I would have probably found a better company for my CCG, this ""art"" is marginal at best. Does not capture essense of series.D"
2,"Nice try, but...","I suppose the people who loved the artwork in this book also thought that Martin was serious when he swore on everything that was holy that his series would not go beyond 3 titles. Now, as we await book 4, we at least have many side-line products to keep us busy. This book of card game art should not be one of those diversions. A few of the images were truly good, but for the most part, seriously lacking. I'm just as rabid a fan as the next reviewer of this product, but I am also honest, and won't label something extraordinary just because someone's name is on it... And while the quality of writing in the series itself has not suffered so far, it concerns me that this series now seems to be marketed more as ""The Wheel of Time and Money - Part 2"" than the great work of modern literature that it is..."
2,"Product OK , but title is deceptive","The product was advertised in the section for Captain Underpants books. I thought that these were books about his sidekick; and since I had never heard of Super Diaper Baby, I thought it was a new character, particularly since it was labeled Prepack of 5--they are not books, they're 5 four inch dolls. Just thought it would be good to put this point out there in case someone else was curious about it."
5,Track list?,The track list above is definitely NOT thel track list from Allies.Is this a misprint?Allies is a great album. It's on of the few cassettes I've held onto because of the scarcity of the CD.I recommend cranking For What It's Worth to 11.
1,Con Artist,"Alex Ransby conned me and others like him into believing his campaign was real. I highly recommend not buying this book and thereby not lining the pockets of a fraudster, conartist and cheat."
3,really fun but it gets old,i played it non stop for about 2 days and havent touched it since. but still a great game for a good price
3,Make sure you read the system requirements,"Like many, I 've put together a hodge podge of older computers for the kids. This game requires a recent computer to run. Three computers of fairly recent vintage (Windows 2000 or XP) all failed to have the right memory, processing speed or graphics boards to run this game. The game was a hit as a present, but we'll probably return it instead of buying a new computer for the children."
3,More Sid Meier Fun,"A good extension of the ""tycoon"" concept. Excellent for both boys and girls, but a little light on the stategy aspect that makes Sid Meier games so much fun. Overall, not as strong as previous efforts such as Railroad or Rollercoaster, but fun none-the-less. Absolutely fabulous for the pre-teen set."
5,What an improvement!,"With the expansion pack, this game simply is awesome to play. Well, still good with out it too.Great graphics, tons of animals, and locations. Comes with a freeform mode with no monetary restrictions. You can walk around the zoo. Clean up trash, empty trash cans, clean up excrement, groom and heal the animals. Or hire staff to do it.My 4 year old cannot get enuff of it. And has played this game, sitting quietly, for as much as 5 hours at a time. And has no trouble using the interface. The freeform mode allows him to do what he wants with no penalty.Even my wife, who almost never liked playing PC games has been playing it. When she can fight my son off :)If you or your kids like animals, this will be a hit. Should grab the expansion pack as well!"
3,Zoo Tycoon 2 Endangered Species,"My kids have spent hours on this game. They love the virtual animals and zoo, and especially being able to construct the zoo however they want. It actually teaches responsibility in that they have to take care of all the animals! We are very happy with this game!"
3,Let the Buyer Beware,"Though I can not play it on my computer, this game looks great. I've Been told that the animals are not as picky as before and the guests are smarter. When It is working, I am sure I will play it a lot. The reason it didn't work is it was created with DirectX, a program that does not work on 90% of PC video cards, including mine. I will have to buy a new video card. If you are going to buy this game, I suggest you look very carefully at Sytem Requirements before buying."
1,Cartoons are for toddlers,"Zoo Tycoon 2 is an extreme disappointment. It should be called Zoo Tycoon 1/2. It is a kindergartener's version of the game, with icons replacing words (for those who cannot read), animals that look like cartoons and a ""biome paintbrush"" that reminds one of the huge, balance-on-your-shoulder pencils that we started making our first letters with. I keep waiting for Bugs Bunny to show up. There is no challenge, no realism in the environment and a truly awkward interface that makes creating a zoo a battle of man-versus-machine. Blue Fang would have been better served to work harder on the original Zoo Tycoon. Most players simply wanted a zoom feature and some control over the behavior of the characters.I consider purchasing ZT2 a waste of money. It is not even fixable. Blue Fang went from high school to kindergarten with this game. They would have been better served to go the other way..."
1,Don't touch it unless you have the right graphics card,It's not just me. Read all the other reviewers who are warning about this. The list of perfectly mainstream graphics cards that this game won't work with is on the Zoo Tycoon support page. ([...]) It is LONG. We have the bog standard: an ordinary Dell with a standard ATI card. Thank you Microsoft for the look of dismay on my son's face as yet another Microsoft game refuses to work... not! I do not think this game is fit for the purpose for which it was sold.
2,Overcomplicated the game while taking away things that made it good,"I was so hyped up for this game. I have been playing the first one for so long so I was excited for being able to upgrade to the 2nd one. Unfortunately, this game is very disappointing.First of all, it seems like everything has been dumbed down. Everything so much more cartoony. The scenarios are not difficult, campaign is not hard. Making an exhibit is extremely boring now. There is no guesswork at all. You just go on the biome tab and just paint out the biome. It comes with trees, plants, rocks, the works. Sure you can put in the trees and rocks yourself but you really won't know how many to put in. They took away the animal interaction system so there is no way to know whether or not an animal likes what you put in.Stupid Zookeepers.They over complicated the game while taking away things that made it good.I would not recommend this game to anyone. It is not fun."
1,Not compatible with Video Cards,"This game is not compatible with so many video cards it is ridiculous. If I were you I would check this list (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/889368) before buying the game. The list wasn't in the paperwork in the game, on the box, or here on amazon. It was a total waste of money and now I am going to have to lose money returning it! What a waste of time and money! My daughter was also very dissapointed when she couldn't play it on our brand new computer! Very dissapointed with this game."
4,The amazing Zoo Tycoon 2,"I enjoyed Zoo Tycoon 2 very much It has a lot of cool things about it .the 3d graphics are awesome and you get to be a zoo keeper in a way . The only bad part about this game is that if you have a large zoo you run out of space to put your animals in , and If your not excperienced with the game you could have a lot of problems running the zoo."
3,hi,this gane is kind of fun. it is a good idea but it gets kind of old after a while. there also isnt much to do overall.
4,Fun,"I really liked this game especially how it was fun but only for a little while. After a while it got old then it came back and then I lost intrest again. But if you really love animals and couldn't wait to make a Zoo of your own then perfect excellent choice. But it you are looking at rollercoaster Tycoon and this get roallercoaster first you can put a waterpark, rollercoasters, and animals in that but these games are both very fun."
3,"Good game, but bad for a slow old computer","This game is a lot of fun, but it requires at least 256 MB of RAM (which I didn't have on my computer) and I didn't know. This game is really fun, but if you have less than 256 MB of RAM it could be quite frusterating to set up."
4,Zoo Tycoon,"I got started on these with roller coaster tycoon, which I still think for the time was/is the best of them all. Somewhere I saw a bundle with the latest roller coaster tycoon, and this one, which was about the same price as this one alone. A better deal I think, but this is still good."
3,another tycoon..........eh,"there is so many tycoon games that i lost count. this is the same......eh. built a zoo, get money and have allot of awards and customers. BUT(the magic word...but)you can get close to your animals and have MORE animals then before. still a same ol' tycoon BUT with good new features. this is NOT a must buy if you have the first one, BUT it will be fun if its your first zoo tycoon. this game is a........eh. bye"
3,Less is More,"The new zoo tycoon 2 definitely has great graphics and it's also definitely more fun -- but I think it's more fun for the younger set! I loved the first zoo tycoon and that would still be my preference -- it required a lot more thought and strategy to complete the goals and keep everyone happy. Over the years I completed all of the scenarios. I bought zoo zycoon 2 because my [...]grandson was visiting. He enjoyed it, but I still haven't been able to get in to it myself."
4,COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!,"When I first found the game I was SO HAPPY! THe first version is TRASH JUNK WORTHLESS compared to this!! Oh, and if it gives you a little dialog box saying you don't have enough system memory and the dialog box has a 'don't show me this again' check box thingy and a continue button then check the afore mentioned check box and click continue. It'll probably work alright.The grahfics when you walk into people (it seems to ""cut"" through the people) aren't so great. {Minus one star.} Other than that its great!!! To all the people who don't like the game BE QUIET SHADDUP!"
2,Still Fun But Not As Good As The Original,"Well... I got the game last night and I already dislike it. It just doesn't seem to have enough. Not enough animals, buildings,folige, or places to build. Of course this may be helped by the Endangered Speices expansion pack. Also there was somthing I liked in the original Zoo Tycoon that they took away here, in the original when you put somthing into an animals exibit, the animals would give you a happy or sad face showing if they liked it or not. Here they took that feature away making it much more difficult to tell if they like that(i.e.) maple tree that you are puting in their exibit. Overall I suggest you stick with the Original Zoo Tycoon, and if you add the dinosaur digs and marine mania expansion pack that will result in hours of fun. I just couldn't have as much fun with number 2. I hope this review was able to help you in your desision."
5,fun,this game is so cool i can't say how much how do you get all the cheats to work oh i think this game is amazing to have more fun put meat eaters with plant eaters and it will look just like the wild just my idea of fun
4,"Kids, and parents, love it","I wouldn't buy this game for kids under 8, unless you intend to sit and help them with it. BUT, I have loved playing with them and think it's a blast!"
1,Systems Requirements,"Beware of the systems requirement. They are not entirely accurate. After much time spent with Microsoft Customer Service, I was very disappointed to hear that my three-year-old Toshiba laptop would have to be updated with some kind of video card in order to play this game. We haven't had a problem with any other computer games (Sims2 plays fine, for example)...."
1,Not Win7 64Bit Compatible,Tried every trick in the book and could not get this game to run in Windows 7 x64 environment. Nice box.
3,"OK, I suppose...","Be warned: this game has some pretty specific requirements and will not work on many machines! Read the box carefully before purchasing it.The actual game is quite different from the original Zoo Tycoon. The graphics are nice, the animals and guests do more, and you can zoom way farther in than you could in the original game (and there's a nice guest mode), but this one seems to be directed more at children than the original was.The animals are way less picky in their exhibits. This allows for more creativity, but it makes this less of a strategy game and more of an elaborate toy. Additionally, there are less animals to choose from. The species are diverse, but number only 30, and considering the complexity of the animals, I doubt that there will be many user created ones in the future."
5,An Obligatory Handbook on Interviews and Interrogations,"Nathan J. Gordon, et al have authored an outstanding publication which is well documented, authoritative, well organized, and an easy read as well as a page turner. This reviewer,who has authored several textbooks on polygraph testing, highly recommends this book to anyone involved in the art and science of interviewing and interrogation."
3,"Looks cool, feels solid, but not sharp and poorly designed","This knife looks and feels solid, but that is where the good part ends. Firstly, it is not sharp at all. After sharpening it for a bit though, it is now pretty sharp but still not as sharp as my Henckel's paring knife. Maybe I just need to keep sharpening it. Another problem is that it is shaped more like a mini cleaver than a true Santoku because the edge has very little curve. I think it is a good knife for the money, as long as you sharpen it. I think it is better to have one really good sharp knife than many ok knives. I generally never use this knife because I will always reach for the sharper Henckel's. If you are on a budget, try Victorinox knives- they're sharp."
5,I love The Proud Family!!,"I watched this on the Disney Channel. I first thought it was going to be dumb. Then turned out really great. I can't wait till the dvd comes out. Disney is finally releasing the Disney Channel Original Movies on dvd. I reccommend this and these other great DCOM's Get a Clue, Cadet Kelly, The Even Stevens Movie, The Cheetah Girls, Halloweentown/ Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge, Halloweentown High, Under Wraps (a rare dvd), and Miracle in Lane 2."
5,the proud movie,Great movie for the kids and they enjoy it very well and watch it all the time they love it so good movie
3,proud,arrived safely and was wrapped as part of the angel tree kid presents. cute and appropriate for the family -
3,cute movie,such a fun and cute show with no sex or violence.I love movies that teach and help. This one does jsut that.
4,Sounds good... doesn't compute.,"I heard a track on Comcast Soundscapes and liked it. I checked it out on Amazon and found a ""New"" CD for $17 and several ""Used"" from $32. This doesn't compute. Also, I can't hear parts of any other tracks. Without better assurance that I'm not tubing $17 I'm unwilling to buy this."
2,Wish It Was Easier & More Visual,"To be fair, the language is easy to understand (some can be too ""techy""). Depending upon the program, I don't always like the simplicity of the 'dummies' books. It has been difficult for me to locate a book for PhotoDeluxe Home Edition, so that is one reason I chose this item.I have found this book slightly difficult to work with as the instructors give 'instructions' but without many ""screen shots"" directing you. This program came w/our computer so I want to learn what we have. I'm also new to photo editing & graphics, so I suppose I need more ""visual guidance"".If you're like me and sometimes need the additional assistance that visuals provide, then I recommend that you try another book."
4,Deserves a wider audience,"I stumbles across Hudson Bell on Pandora and cannot believe the band does not have a wider audience. Even though this is fantastic, ""When the Sun is the Moon"" is staggering."
4,Floor puzzle fun!,"My son is 3, he loves thomas the train and puzzles. He really enjoyed figuring out how all of the pieces fit together to make his favorite character."
5,Excellent Puzzle,Purchased this for my three year old nephew who is a Thomas fanatic. He loves this puzzle and does it almost daily. This has continued for more than 9 months and he still enjoys doing the puzzle. Would highly recommend it.
3,Very annoying for a 3-yr old!,The pieces do not hold up as you are making the puzzle. And this for my son who is good with these things.
1,Happy Gumbo,"I purchased this book several years ago in Louisiana, but lost it. I wanted to buy it again, so I went on Amazon web page and purchased it. There are several recipes in there that are really great. Give it a try you will love."
5,Very Pretty,"The ring looks exactly like it does in the picture, actually it's even more shiny. It came in a cute little box with a bow on it and the delivery was quick. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
5,Wonderful,I was looking for a simple heart ring and found this one. It was exactly what I was looking for. It is absolutely beautiful and I love it. Thanks!
5,Smiling Wife,"My wife loves this ring, altho she has more expensive rings, she says its the thought that counts and that makes me feel good too so if you want to make her happy, amd feel good yourself try this little honey, you wont regret it."
4,Great as a gift!,Got this as a gift for my little cousin and she absolutely loves it. No problems with size or anything! Item came as described and it was a late gift just before christimas and they got it to me on time. Will purchase from this seller again
3,Nice,Ring is a lot thinner than i imagined but good for the price. i would like it if it were a little thicker. Cute.
3,Not same product,"Not the product shown in either the web site or in the picture here. Cheaper, smaller, and tapered too much."
1,Really small and chinzy,Did the other 5 star reviewer actually see the product? These are tiny rectangles of fly paper that have holes on each end so you can put the (included) toothpick through it and stick it in your plant pot. I found them to be small and useless. The package could fit about 10 times or more of the contents it comes with. Disappointing - useless...
2,kind of works,"The product only partially works for gnats. The bugs are not really drawn to the sticky pad itself, but they do buzz around alot and if you put them in places where the bugs congregate you do catch quite a few this is certainly not a solution, but does reduce their number a bit."
3,Not what I expected,"The product is ok, but it did not get rid of ALL the gnats. We still have a few."
1,Bad Investment,"Dont waste your money on this product. Followed directions and placed product in multiple locations. They have been in place for 5 days and not attracted one gnat, in fact the gnats can be seen flying around them. Absolutely a waste of money"
3,Recycled,"Made in AUT in 1991, Serial# 468853-2, Playing Time 67:40This 16-track compilation lifts material from numerous CT albums, up to 1988's ""Lap Of Luxury"".The track selection is not made up of all my favorites, but the nice thing about the CD is that it covers 9 of their first 11 albums: only ""All Shook Up"" and ""The Doctor"" aren't represented here.For the novice, you get good tracks, but more importantly, a great overview of the group's first decade of recordings, enough to stimulate you to buy specific albums. Each album is previewed by 2 tracks at most. Also note that tracks 1 and 4 are taken from their live ""At Budokan"" effort.Not spectacular, but a great sampler..."
4,Another great complilation! Where do these foreigners keep coming up with these great sets? Why can't our CT cmps. be this good?,"Five very good songs from the Jon Brant/Cheap Trick era are on here: Cover Girl,If You want My Love, She's Tight, Dancingthe Night Away and Tonight it's you. Out-standing! Great cover, too. Jon, you arethe man! Cover was originally back of Oneon One lp. Good stuff! Pick up on it!"
3,Important but difficult book.,This is a classic book on the theory of elastic stability. Most graduates students in engineering these days would have trouble understanding much of this book because they are not taught many of the analytic methods used in the book. The book assumes a solid understanding of analytic methods of structural analysis (e.g. slope-deflection method) and differential equations. Lots of good information on special cases whose solution is tabulated/graphed. Fortunately this paperback edition is cheap enough for anyone to buy.
1,Not for submissives,"This book isn't at all what i thought i was getting. i was looking for books dealing with Master/slave relationships, this is a book about submission as God designed in relation to the Church. Don't buy it if you are seeking information about D/s relationships."
3,Disapointed,"when i ordered this i was expecting something similar to the Ryuichi plushie, but its not.1 it can only sit, or rather NOT sit, as it cannot balance in its perpetual seated position2 the face is painted on, its plastic-decal which means over time it will wear out.3 the black spots on the costume are decal too, and only the ones on the ears are fabric4 its NOT an 8"" plushie but shorter since it just sits there. (about 6""-7"")5 its obviously poorly made because the ears are just pieces of felt, the same as his cow-lick, which have a danger of easily being ripped off6 the costume itself is of a rough polyester material instead of brushed plush-like material. (so beware if your allergic to synthetics)so really, this plush toy is ""for display purposes only"" as its not really ""cuddle quality"""
5,movie,my sister asked me to order this for my nephew and he's loved it since he got it...it was a christmas gift
3,meh...,I only like about 2 songs on this disk. I would recommend looking up the mp3's of the songs you like on this cd and downloading them instead.
1,Worst Customer Service..............,"I purchased this coffee maker last year and it died before a year was up. The customer service was horrible, and it will cost me over $30 to get a replacement sent to me. The return process was a 5 step process and included MY check for $15 to send me a new coffee maker. Excuse me, didn't YOU fail the test? Why am I sending YOU $15 for a product that failed? I also had to pay to send it back. It took two phone calls to customer service to get that answer, and all the e-mails to them with a copy of the original receipt.I will never, never purchase a DeLongi product again. I recommend you don't either.BYS"
5,Awsome Coffee!,"Ok, I was a bit hesitant after I read some of the reviews as I was replacing my Cuisinart Grind & Brew ($159) that I've loved for the past 5 years.Well, the DeLonghi 14 cup coffeemaker is even better!! The 14 cup capacity is wonderful. The aroma button really does allow you to use so much less coffee and if you're using an expensive brand this is a huge plus in our current economic situation.I've had zero problems...no leaking, no cleaning issues-much easier to clean than the machine I replaced. Sleek design. On top of all this I saved over $20 ordering it thru Amazon as opposed to Macy's. So all in all I am one happy coffee drinking gal!!"
4,Amazon perfect in response to issues,"We were in need of a good 14 cup coffee maker. After reading reviews, we ordered this one. With the first one, the carafe was clearly used as it had a dried coffee stain in the bottom. I cleaned it easily, but the carafe leaked badly. Amazon happily replaced the entire maker. The second maker was used approximately 2 months when the carafe began to leak. Amazon again replaced the maker without issue. We have had this one and are very happy with it. (Please know all carafes were washed by hand, not the dishwasher). The point I wish to make is that Amazon stands behind their products and for that reason, I feel confident with any order. By the way, great coffee!"
1,"awful ergonimics, average coffee, poor reliability","As a coffee maker, it isn't anything terribly special. Has a marker/stairstep inside to indicate water level instead of one of those bulbs that will eventually stick. Warmer doesn't burn the last of the coffee, but probably because it has turned off by then.Has an ""aroma"" mode which takes 75 minutes to brew a pot. Only used it a couple of times and decided it wasn't worth it.Setting clock and timer is a pain. One button and you have to wait for it to go all the way around. No fast/slow buttons. One direction only. After a while it will start blinking and nobody can explain why. Unplugging it clears it and then there's is 5 minutes of joy to reset its clock. A two second power failure is all it takes to clear it.Machine beeps every 15 minutes to let you know it is a pain. Shuts off after two hours whether you like it or not. I really don't prefer cold coffee to slightly overcooked coffee.Died after less than a year."
1,worst coffeemaker ever,"This is the worst coffeemaker I have ever purchased. It has the most annoying beep every 15 minutes to let you know it is still on. The coffee is not hot when the brewing is finished and it only keeps it lukewarm for 2 hours. After 1 hour you certainly have to put your coffee in the microwave to heat it up. But the best feature of this coffeemaker is that it only lasted 6 WEEKS!!!! Can you imagine that, it stopped working, died dead in a month and a half. I have purchased other DeLonghi products, but our relationship is permanently ended, kaput. We put the coffeemaker in the trash bin, exactly where it belongs. Cusinart makes a much better product, the Italians should pay attention to their competition!!"
1,No More Delonghi Products,"A year ago this month I purchased this coffee maker after reading a rave review. It worked great until October when it just quit working completely. Delonghi replaced it (although it took over a month). Just six weeks after receiving the replacement, that one quit also. Now they decided to replace it with a 'new' machine which is a totally different one (DCF2212T) This one isn't any better as the pull out basket area won't stay shut and also was supposed to have a button to push to open the basket area. It doesn't. You just pull. I have only had it a week, and several times while getting coffee, the basket area opens. I have to actually slam it shut to keep it shut. I will never purchase another DeLonghi product."
3,2 months of great coffee,"I purchased the DeLonghi 14 cup for a group at work. We make one pot of coffee a day. It was great for two months, excellent coffee. Everyone was happy. After two months the heating element died - back to the good old Mr. Coffee for us. It was a great coffee maker for almost two months - a little pricy for two months, but good coffee."
1,Less than a year old and already broken.,"We enjoyed excellent coffee from the Delonghi -- it was a gift to my husband -- until it simply stopped working two weeks ago.Less than a year old, and completely defunct. I have a braun coffeemaker that's nearly 10 years old. The Delonghi did not last 10 months and it was three times the price.Extremely disappointing."
2,GREAT COFFEE BUT BREAKS,"I agree with the rest of reviews, Brews great coffee, but likes to break after nine months to a year!!!!"
2,Excellent Coffee; Lousy caraffe,"We've owned this for less than a year and enjoyed the coffee it makes. Programming is easy, coffee prep is a breeze, and the charcoal filter improves the coffee taste. Unfortunately, the pot has a design flaw, as mentioned by others: After awhile the plastic rim around the pot expands and allows coffee to leak just under the pour spout. In order not to spill it all over the kitchen counter, we're forced to fill our cups at the kitchen sink. Going to contact Delonghi and see if they'll send me a new pot. I was also disappointed that this brand is made in China, because I've had other DeLonghi appliances that were made elsewhere and the quality is much different."
1,"good coffee, bad coffee maker","Too bad the coffee maker died after about 12 months. Coffee makers should be made to last more than a year, but that may not be the case anymore. I keep buying the beautiful counter trophy ones year after year while my ugly ones sit in the cabinet, faithful, durable, yet hidden. Now, this one, still looking beautiful, died and I am angry with all the beautiful coffee makers."
3,Attractive but has good features and bad,"Makes good coffee but the reason I purchased this is because of the 14 cup feature. The problem is the coffee filter basket is small - it is the same size as probably an 8 cup coffee maker so you can't get much coffee in it to make 14 cups of strong coffee. If you put enough coffee in the basket to make 14 cups then grounds splash all over the top of lid, where the water holes are and you get all kinds of grounds in the coffee. It is a mess to clean up. Plus the constant 15 minute alarms are just plain annoying - adults of coffee drinking age are usually smart enough to realize the passage of time and don't need beeping every 15 minutes to remind you that there is a pot of coffee on your kitchen counter.Plus I have seen many reviews on many web sites (after I purchased) that said that they don't last and they all cite the same problem, the melting of the hoses.On the plus side it is attractive and makes nice coffee."
4,Like it,"Was looking for a coffee maker with large capacity for my coffee drinking family. This makes a good cup of coffee, the carafe does not drip when pouring ( a big plus!). Also has auto shutoff, which we need at our house!Resetting the clock and timer after being unplugged is a bit of a pain -- you have to hold the button in and cycle through the 24 hour clock to the correct time. Otherwise, it works just fine."
3,easy to use and nice looking,that is where it ends! delivers coffee that is warm not hot very disapointed in the temp i wish i would have bought another cuisinart!
5,What is not to like?,"Easy to use, attractive design, makes aromatic hot coffee. I like the aroma function that brews the coffee slower and uses the ""shower head method"" to better soak the coffee grounds while brewing. As long as the machine doesn't break down, the 5 stars will remain. Silly me, I thought maybe was made in Italy, but no, made is China. I bought this because of good price, free shipping and attractive design. It has more pluses than that. It is a good buy!"
1,Only worked for about 10 days,"Seemed like a great product out of the box, but after about a week and a half it stopped brewing coffee; the warming plate didn't even stay hot. I've obviously got a lemon -- and so far the Amazon vendor that shipped the product hasn't responded to e-mail describing the problem launched from Amazon's ""your-recent-orders"" page. Now I've got to try to get someone on the phone & see what it will take to get a replacement. Ho hum."
2,Nice Looking and worrks fine,"It is after all just a coffee maker but it does the job well. The coffee is hot and it even smells great if you push the aroma button. I have no idea how that works but the coffee smell is stronger if you push it.It loads easily with both coffee and water. Everything works as it should.Pay attention to its size..it is a bit larger than most and I have to slide it out from the wall to open it up to load in coffee and water. Oh and the amount of coffee is suggests is insane, use your own judgement. It does a good job with 2 cups or a full pot.I don't think you will be disappointed.Addendum: It just died one morning it was less than a year old. I now think much less of it obviously and advise you to look elsewhere for a coffee maker."
2,Heatiing element stopped working,This was a replacement for a long used Delonghi coffee maker we loved that finally broke. This one worked great for about a month then completely stopped working. 6am - no coffee! The heating element seemed to completely stop working.
2,I've bought two of these--both died within 6-7 months,"I really liked this coffeemaker -- while it worked. Unfortunately, the first one I bought died after just 6 months of use. The second one I bought died after 7 months. While I have the original receipt, the hassle of returning it to the manufacturer isn't worth it. I'm not willing to see if the ""third time's a charm"" with this coffee maker."
3,coffee pot,"The coffee pot works as advertised, however, the reason I chose this product is because there was no mention of a ""charcoal filter"" as with my previous Cuisinart product. I was very disappointed that this product requires the use of a charcoal filter with absolutely no mention whatsoever in the product description."
3,the beeps will drive you crazy ..,"The coffee pot was well constructed ,made great coffee ..one BIG problem ..there is a freshness feature on this pot that has a signal that sounds off every fifteen minutes , there is no way of shutting this off...do not understand the need for this but it will drive you crazy ,,,had to return the the unit ..."
1,Won't Try It,"I wanted to buy this DeLonghi coffee maker, but the amount of reviews stating various parts breaking nixes it for me. I won't even try it. I don't want a broken carafe due to faulty handle, or melted plastic base, or dead, short-lived heating element etc! Wow. It sounds like a wonderful, short lived piece of junk."
2,Poor pour!,"After some shopping I purchased this coffee maker because of it's review from Consumer Report. I also wanted the larger carafe which is a 14-Cup. Two days after the first use, the carafe leaked around the rim spilling on my counter and floor. I went online and after a couple of weeks, recieved a new one in the mail. Well, it took two days again for the new one to leak and it is worse than the first one. The weight of a full carafe with hot liquid in it pulls the glas away from the black plastic. I now pour my coffee over the sink everytime.As with all coffee makers, it is only a matter of time before the warmer or something else stops working and I will replace it with another highly rated model only to be disappointed by a poorly manufactured product. Buyer beware!"
1,Leaks coffee when you pour!,This is one of the worst coffee pots I have ever had. The plastic around the lip of the carafe expands as the coffee is brewed which causes the carafe to leak coffee everywhere when you try to pour a cup. I will not buy another coffee pot with a plastic ring around the top of the carafe again! The coffee didn't taste bad although a little slow to perk. I bought this pot to replace another leaky pot by a different manufacturer. That pot had a plastic ring around the carafe too. I just didn't make the connection until I got this one. I wouldn't recommend this machine to anyone!
2,You pay for what you don't get...,"I bought this coffee maker about 8 months ago, and it was great! Then about two weeks ago it started leaking water EVERYWHERE while brewing. I thought if I dropped more money into a nice coffee maker that it would last me a long while, but I was wrong. I'm going back to cheapy coffee makers that I know will last longer than this one did."
2,"Great size, leaky pot","Was really excited to come across this cone filtered coffee maker with 14 cup capacity, however, after less than a month the silicone seal between the glass carafe and its plastic rim gave out and we end up pouring out nearly a cup of good coffee each morning as it dribbles out the neck. Solid glass carafe would have been a small but crucial improvement. Now having to replace it out of frustration. It was hard enough finding a cone filter machine now here we go again..."
1,Drip Water from Below,Loved this coffee maker for 1 year and 1 month. Then water started dripping out the bottom. About 1 cup per 8 brewed. For this amount of money I need at least 3 years of use.
3,Great machine...that died after two years,"I don't expect electrical appliances to last forever. But a $50 coffeepot? I expected to get at least 4-5 years out of it. No such luck: after 2 years of use (brewing about 4-5 pots a week), the heating element died.While it worked, it was a great coffee pot that never scalded my coffee and treated it with the respect java deserves, which is why it extracted even 3 stars from me.RIP Delonghi. Hello, mechanical / pour-type coffee mater!"
2,"Good Coffee, Poor Reliability","We wanted to find a coffeemaker that made excellent coffee. Our internet research led us to the DeLonghi DC514T 14 cup coffeemaker. Reviews were correct, this machine makes a very good cup of coffee... HOWEVER, I made the mistake of not checking product reliability because after 5 months this machine started leaking water all over the counter. I would have known this if I had checked reliability. If you are reading this then you have covered all bases and probably will not buy this product. ""MY loss is your gain"". I sent a comment to DeLonghi today, not sure if they will make good on this defective machine."
5,A terrific album,"This is truly a great album. It combines industrial style beats and sampling with pure punk aggression. There is not a bad song on the album.Super Cool Nothing seems more complete than 16 volts previous records (which I also highly reccommend). Each track makes sense and leads you into the next.This is easily the best album I bought in 1998.It's very sad that 16 volt broke up and we will not be able to hear any new music.If you like any kind of industrial, punk or other aggressive music you will certainly enjoy this album."
1,For sheer voyeurism,This book is terrible. It is not journalism. It is not fiction. It is the worst of both.
4,Better Than Expected,"I began my reading of this book with a sense of lessened expectations due to the poor reviews McGinniss had received from its release. While moving on I found myself relating rather easily to the stylistic approach he used. Any frequent reader of the Kennedy's knows how difficult it is for authors to obtain any amount of information concerning the ""mythical"" family. I would find it hard to believe that Joe McGinnis would be the first Kennedy author to take liberties in interpretation of certain aspects. The book my be an even better read if the authors note is read first, as to create an understanding of the approach McGinniss took in this project. While nowhere near the best of Kennedy books it certainly is one that all Kennedy fans should find interesting and insightful."
3,Hold your Horses,"It seems people blow simple things out of proportion when it comes to a book about a powerful political figure. In the book when Senator Kennedy had to borrow JFK's suit to wear for the funeral of his brother. Since Ted Kennedy is too large for the suit, the author writes ""Ted descended down the steps, no doubt praying the pants would not rip."" How this can be interpreted into ""makings things up out of whole cloth"" I have no clue. This is just the author's way of describing Ted's want and need to fill in his brother's shoe's, and his fear that he couldn't live up to it. And when an author describes a true life event that happens to be written about in another book can be considered plageurism?Well being a Kennedy, I guess he can have anything made from hay to gold.Don't believe everything you read in Vanity Fair."
1,This book is part plagarized part made up,When are you going to learn Joe McGinness? Start labeling your books fiction because most of them are. I would advise people not to even waste thier money on this fiction book.
5,Excellent speaker stand!,"I purchased for my bookshelf speakers that were placed too low. 16"" hight just gives right amount of lift I needed. It is now in level with my ear while sitting on sofa/chair. For the money, I think this is good buy. Assembly was easy and didn't have any issue what so ever.. Yes, it is not made of solid wood but what would you expect at this price level? They look good/slick and solid/sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone needed bookshelf speaker stands."
3,Cheeeap! You get what you pay for...,"The stands look alright and do what they are supposto do. That sed, they are poorly finished the outside of the wood on the bottom and speaker base plate are grainy and the paint will rub off if you try to wipe them down. I had to take the spikes off the bottom because they were punching holes in the carpet."
3,A little flimsy.,"The instructions for assembly are totally useless, ignore them and just use some common sense.For example, step 1 says to set the base on the ground and bolt the uprights in place... how are you supposed to tighten the screws? From Australia?I, instead assembled the top platform fist, which is smaller and thus more manageable; I then turned the thing over and bolted the base from the top. Screw the spikes and you're done!"
1,Just Awful Sound!,"These songs demand more care in the quality of their presentation. The sound is uniformly terrible. Beware, and don't buy unless it's a last resort to obtain these classic recordings. Sounds like copies off casette of copies that were scratched. Avoid!"
5,Packed with Knowledge!,"Planning a corporate party or special event? Don't lift a finger until you've read The Business of Event Planning. In this highly practical book, author Judy Allen covers every aspect of the process in exhaustive detail. Allen, an author, writer and experienced event planner, contends that events are more than just feel-good activities. Events, she says, must be staged as strategic tools with return-on-investment potential. If you want to know how, she covers all the basics. Even though the book is geared toward large events, the principles can be applied to functions of any size. Allen includes details of proposal writing, itineraries, contract negotiations, fee setting, high tech applications and security concerns in a post-September-11 world. We from getAbstract recommend this logistical guide to corporate staffers or event planners who want to master the fine details."
2,Should be named corporate event travel,"This is a great book if your planning a corporate trip to a tropical island. This is a book about booking caterers, airline tickets, hotels, etc... and how to make a proposal outlining how you will do these things. There are no ""behind the scenes secrets"" for actual event planning. Very mis-leading title and I am looking to get my money back."
4,new vs used book,Its a book i needed for my events planning class.Its agood book howeveri was buying it new and when i recieved the book there were already pages higlighted as if it was a used book.
1,Not Enough Chinese,"I took Just Enough Chinese with me to China in October 2001 but never used it because I found its phonetics to be faulty. For example, the first phrase to learn is Xiexie, which means thank you. This book would have you say ""Sie-sie,"" by which I guess it means ""See-see."" However, ""ie"" in pinyin spelling is said like the ""e"" in ""yes."" Furthermore, the pinyin ""x"" is much closer to our ""sh"" than it is to ""s,"" so nothing about the pronunciation offered is sufficiently accurate. Our tour guide in China said that ""see-see"" is the Chinese equivalent of what we euphemistically call ""tinkle"" (urination by a small child). Is that what you want to say instead of thank you?"
3,How to get frustrated in China,"This book is better than nothing. But don't fool yourself by thinking that the subtitle of the book, ""How to Get By and Be Easily Understood,"" is anything near accurate. There is NO WAY any Chinese speaker is going to understand a thing you say from this book, unless you have had a semester of college-level Chinese. On the plus side, the contents are divided nicely into useful sections such as everyday expressions, meeting people, shopping for food, etc. Since the Chinese characters are included with each phrase, you can at least show the person with whom you are trying to communicate with."
2,"Not for a saxophone beginner, but a jazz improvisor","This video is not for a saxophone beginner. I would rather say, this video is for a beginning improviser who wants to develop or learn to make his music more jazz, or the most important thing --- to play Faster!Yes, the instructor has a good tone, and a good embouchure, and ofcourse he is good at everything as a teacher in Berklee. But in this video, he doesn't tell any secret of playing fast, but an open secret --- practice. Actually, he doesn't talk much in the video. I think over 80% of the video is his demonstration over the exercises from the book given. Yes, i like his demos, because at least i know how does he start a phrase, end a phrase, and all that jazz. But the 1st phrase of each exercise is good enough. He tries to show each phrase in ALL KEYS throughout ALL the exercises! I appreciate his effort, but that's too much, sorry."
1,"Avoid, save your money",I am still trying to understand this video. Just watching Jim Odgren play notes does not advance ones learning. This DVD is not for a beginner. No emphases on embouchure is included. Save your money.
3,"a bit involved, but worth it to stick with","i think i'd go 3.5 on this one. overall it was a good book, there were just some long periods that were a little slower and i found myself rushing through to get back to the more interesting parts. i also had to read another book while i was reading this one because you kind of had to really be in the mood to read this one which i'm not always after a long crappy day of work! ;p i would recommend the book but w/the note that it can be a little involved but overall it is worth it to read the whole thing."
2,"Great book, terrible on a Kindle","I was really eager to read this book, but I found it to be one of the worst candidates for Kindle reading ever. It has a lot of footnotes that are great and add a lot to the story (a la Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, one of my absolute favorites!), but the process of clicking on these footnotes in order to read them and then attempting to get back to the location where you were when you originally clicked was a NIGHTMARE. I ended up giving up after several frustrating experiences clicking a million times to try to get back to my spot and just ended up checking it out from the library. All in all, a total waste of money.The book itself is awesome. Just don't buy the Kindle version."
4,Captivating and engrossing story,The first book I read on my Kindle and what a read it was! I don't know how much the novelty of using the Kindle or the actual book is what made me love the story but it is one that kept my attention for hours. I purchased it after downloading the free sample and read it before starting one of the books I had downloaded earlier. The story is a real page-turner and is well worth the time to finish it. Highly recommended!
4,Recommended!,"This novel starts off too slow for my liking and takes quite a while to get going, but once it does - you can't put it down. Some of the twists are quite obvious, but on the whole this was a good read. Recommended."
4,Intricate & Detailed,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit! Meticulously researched, the historical detail did bog down the book, but that was really its only flaw. The characters, and their surprising actions, were fascinating and the intricate plot moved unpredictably. I really enjoyed this, though when I was halfway through I originally had no intention of reading the sequel (it does get a little slow in parts), but now that I have finished, I am quite interested in reading it! All in all, it was very well done!"
2,Struggling to get through it,"I picked this book up a few weeks ago. Opened it and began to read that same night...then it just failed miserably for me. I am going to set it aside and try it again some other time. I can't really give it an appropriate star rating as I have just barely made it to page 50 and its just so terribly ""MEH"""
3,It's okay,"This is the first of two books that make the full story complete. The basic idea is a long, twisted tale of revenge. I like Victorian mysteries, and this book sounded appealing. I usually read a 300 plus page book in a few hours, especially if it really pulls me in. This one went a bit slowly, picking through the footnotes and details of the plot. It reminds me of the scene in Amadeus when the Emperor says Mozart's music has too many notes. There were many pages that I scanned and flipped to get to the action of the story. The second book flowed more easily and I skimmed less of it. So, be ready for a book that takes a bit more attention to detail and longer to get to the point, but is very true to Victorian times and has a good plot."
2,Dreary,"I found this book to be long, drawn out, dreary and impossibly dull. I kept waiting for the story to take off and it never did for me.If you like to read a lot of footnotes in a work of fiction then read this book.I am donating my copy to my local library-- not a book I feel compelled to have in my personal library.Boring, ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
2,"A long, tedious, tiresome read","By volume, this book competes with 'Crime and Punishment' by Dostoevsky. By content, it fails superbly not only in story, but in writing style as well.In a nutshell, the story is about an individual who feels betrayed by fate for his insignificant rank in society and one day decides to punish a man he believes is responsible for this misfortune. In all honesty, this is it. For 700 pages the author introduces mundane dialogs and meaningless characters and finally manages to convince me, no, to force me to ache for the death of the poor man, just so that I can see this book end. I seriously don't recommend this book.If, however, you are determined to spend many, many, many hours reading something from the distant past, try 'The Egyptologist' by Arthur Phillips. It is a much more entertaining novel and will make the time you invest reading it seem a lot more valuable.by Simon Cleveland"
1,much ado about ??,"This book has been touted as a real wonder, so marvelous, blah, blah, blah. Boring, slow moving, and highly overated!! I'm sorry I bought it - got suckered in to another foolish purchase by reviews. When will I learn?"
2,"Great beginning, but downhill from there...","This book is sold on its remarkable opening sentence. Alas, it's downhill from there. Well, not quite, but almost. That is, up until the author detours to give us the backstory (after just a couple of chapters), it is a gripping narrative. Unfortunately, the backstory is much, much longer than it needs to be--the author losing his focus, it seems, and falling into repetitive and unnecessary detail. Then, when he finally takes us back to real time, the ending is without surprise or irony and I, for one, shrugged and wondered why I had invested the effort.The writing, to be sure, is good. Not great, but good, and I wonder if all the historical footnotes are for our benefit, as they certainly don't help move the story along, or the author's need to prove how much research he did."
5,Beautifully written atmospheric mystery,"This book has been out for some time, so I'm just writing this to give it another 5-star review. If you enjoy dark mysteries in the faux-Victorian style, this is for you. And it's better than anything Wilkie Collins or Dickens ever came up with when writing during that period. It gives Charles Palliser's THE QUINCUNX a run for the money in atmosphere and plot and has the advantage of being shorter and less intellectually challenging/puzzling. The latter statement is not meant to be a criticism of THE MEANING OF NIGHT. I'm still not sure about everything I read in THE QUINCUNX but Cox's book is accessible to all."
5,Victorian Redux,"I loved this big, intricate novel with its Victorian England setting, complete with country houses, class distinctions, atmospheric descriptions, and the blurring of the lines between good and evil. There are enough plot synopses here so there's no need to rehash that. Suffice it to say that there are enough twists and turns here that I caught myself pulling for someone who, in the opening sentence of the book, confesses to the murder of an innocent man. The narrator/killer is far from being the nastiest character in the book.It's a great story that will take you out of this place and time for a while. At 700ish pages, it is not a short read, but it is well worth the time you put into it. Highly recommended."
3,I Book I Cannot Stick With,"Sigh. What can I say? This sounds like a brilliant piece of literature. Brooding. Moody. Atmospheric. Well-written. Intricate. The story of the writer completing it after years of effort (and dying soon after) only adds to the mystique. But I tried three times in a year to finish this book and finally had to give up because I would lose interest every time I attempted to plod thru to the end. So I'm sorry to admit I just wasn't able to get into The Meaning of Night, and if that tells you anything, then...good."
5,This is a book you will always keep in your home and read often.,I think this is one of my all time favorite books. At first I thought the main character to unlikeable and too neurotic. As the book progresses I begin to understand him. I love this book and want my kids to read it in the future. It is a classic.
2,Far too long,"The story dragged for me and because I found the main character so unlikable, I couldn't finish it. I really wanted to like it because it was recommended to me."
3,Slow start but a worthy ending,"This book was very slow to start but, once it did, it was very intriguing. However, I never really found the main character to be very sympathetic--though I don't think the author aimed to make him cuddly. It was because of this that the book didn't resonate with me all that much. In fact, I found the character unsympathetic enough that I never ceased to doubt the veracity of his story. Still, the ending was very sad and was the only real place in the book where I did feel some sympathy for Edward."
5,wonderful movie collection!,This was a wonderful collection of movies for a very good price. We are enjoying them a lot with our grandkids! Thanks so much for a great sale.
5,Love these movies!,We think these are the cutest movies. The whole family loves them. They will make a great Christmas gift!! Yeah!
4,Collection of Wallace and Gromit,"Purchased the dvd's to update my outdated VHS format. Love all three original movies. Was a little shocked by the content of thenew movie, ""A Matter of Loaf and Death"". A little adult for small children and not my favorite. I like the innocence of the originalmovies. Would recommend the three originals."
4,Golden Oldie,"I'm a major W&G fan, and these 4 episodes are the very reason. The DVD set is great, with the minor caveat that there are about half a dozen promotional spots prior to the actual episodes. Fortunately you can fairly easily skip them."
4,Blue Ray jip,Wallace & Gromit is a fun watch. I paid for Blue Ray and I'm mad. The title is Blue Ray and nothing else. I was robbed.
1,Don't buy this unless you love commercials,"We bought this set to replace a single CD of the 3 original short films, which got scratched. The single CD version has no commercials at the beginning, so you can navigate pretty quickly to the actual film you want to see.This set has each film on a different disk, and each disk has about 5 minutes or more of commercials before you can view anything else. These include a promo for some kind of Wallace and Gromit game, a Saun the Sheep video, another W&G; video _which is included in the set_, a Bob the Builder video, and a Thomas the Tank Engine commercial. And I may have forgotten some others....So, if you don't have kids, or don't mind being harassed to buy yet more videos and games and toys every time you want to watch Wallace and Gromit, this set should be fine to you.Otherwise, DON'T BUY IT!"
5,A great collection,"This collection is a bargain. Wallace and Gromit are household favorites here. The collection is thoroughly entertaining, including the supplementary material on how the characters came to be, how the movies were made, and so on. Be aware that there is a fifth movie not included --""The Curse of the Were Rabbit"". That's a ""must buy"" as well."
5,Lots of fun!,Loved watching every episode. Brought back lots of memories..haven't seen these in a few years. Good old Gromit always saves the day. Hooray for Wallace and Wensleydale!
4,Laugh out loud funny!,"This is one great package for the whole family, no matter what the ages! I first saw ""The Wrong Pants"" on TV a few years ago, and vowed that I would treat myself to owning it, but I couldn't find it in any of the stores. Well, it took a few years, but what a nice surprise to find the 4-CD product at Amazon! The whole collection by the brilliant Brit Nick Park! I'm giving this as gifts to everyone now."
1,Bad Disc,"Disc 1,2 and 3 played OK. Disc 4 played tht ads and previews but would not play the movie. I returned it and received a replacemrnt with the same problem. I assume the coding or software must be incorrect since since all my other DVD's play OK."
4,HA HA!!!!,"This is a wonderful addition to your family collection. Very entertaining and awesome. My son is ten and is thrilled by the clay-mation, characters and story line. Very good!"
4,"Wallace and Gromit is clean, clever fun for all ages!","Anything Nick Park had a hand in creating is worth watching, and the Wallace and Gromit 4-disc collection is no exception. My son loves these little short films (about 50-60 minutes apiece), and I do as well. Wallace is the sweet, earnest, inventive but still bumbling owner of Gromit, his loyal (and much smarter) dog, who is always helping Wallace to clean up the messes he invariably makes.As I said - it's clean, clever fun for all ages. The animation is great, the scripts are great, the voice actors are great, and Nick Park is just awesome. You're doing yourself a disservice if you're not watching this stuff. Parents who, like me, try to avoid the tripe Disney produces 90% of the time, and aren't into forcefeeding their children idealized unrealistic love stories -- BUY THIS SET. Your kids will love it and you will too. This is quality high-class entertainment for the entire family."
1,Johann,"Pathetic,pity I`m so far of in South Africa I wish I could send this book back for a full refund???"
4,Evocative disco,"At the time in the 1970s, the Disco genre was often sneered at for its supposed shallowness and superficiality, But some of the music has passed the test of time with flying colours, for example Donna Summer, Grace Jones, The Bee Gees' Saturday Night Fever and Odyssey. This album displays the multifaceted talents of this great dance group that created some real classy pop. There are mellow, evocative tracks like Native New Yorker and gripping, passionate numbers like Use It Up (And Wear It Out), an up-tempo classic with killer hooks and an irresistible rhythmic structure. Other hits on this great album include Hang Together, Easy Come Easy Go, Going Back To My Roots and If You're Looking For A Way Out. This is stylish pop music with dancefloor appeal, full of great tunes and appealing lyrics. I suppose one could call it proto-house, but it has much more personality than most of today's bland club efforts."
2,Yawn,"You're not likely to find a Stephenson fan out there who's more willing to praise his work. And as for Bury, well, all I can say is that this collaboration is 1 for 2. Everything that Interface is/was, The Cobweb is not. I was barely able to finish it, and I'm sorry I did. It's not so much that it's horribly bad...not at all...it's merely adequate, which comes as a shock based on the fact that *everything* else he's written has been flat-out superlative."
3,Cobweb = Middle of the Road,"I did not know Neil Stephenson wrote Cobweb under the ""Bury"" name. (Just finished his ""Cryptonomicon"": great book but too long). The Cobweb is a frightening peak at the production of bioweapons of mass destruction, made of course in America, and sold to, you guessed it, Iraq. The scenario/plot is realistic enough but the dialog and characters often seem rather contrived and formulaic. If you have nothing else to read, this book is it. At least you'll learn what ""cobwebbing"" is. IF you have another book that's better, read it instead."
4,A pretty good book with a pretty mediocre ending,"Although the 'hero'(Clyde Banks) was a very intriguing character and the portions of the book dedicated to his story were great, the other parts of the book were good but a little flat compared to Clyde's. All in all... a good read and worth the 7 bucks."
5,I Am Your Misfortune,"This is a great little storybook. I am Lithuanian. Stories from the old country are important to pass to the younger generation so, they do not die. This book does that and teaches a really important lesson too. It is geared to 5-7 year olds but can be read to younger. The pictures are pretty however not too colorful. It is the lesson that is important."
5,Grandma & Kids,I ordered this game for myself. Now my grandkids compete with me for top score. We enjoy this game alot. Found out my 7 year old is much better at the matrix mix than I am.
3,Slingo deluxe review,"I like the slingo games, and although this was fun, it wasn't as fun as I expected. I had played Slingo Supreme online, and I thought this game would be close to that, but it really wasn't."
1,Still waiting for my game,I would like to write a review for this game. I ordered it onApril 9 and it has not yet shipped. This is very disappointing.
4,Twin Peaks=Deke & Mickey,"This is a band, every member is a force, kinda like Deep Purple Mk. II. But there would be no Man w/o guitars...and we mean Deke Leonard & Mickey Jones. Very tasty, very tight. Plus they sing, and well, at that. Check em out, live @ the Roundhouse. Wish I could've been there. Welsh Connection, Born w/a Future...take no prisoners!"
1,Bad surprise,"Cheap but still worth less than that: no info or data of any kind for this short (around half hour!)release! The Eckstine band of the forties is woth more respect. Rather get any other release!jc (Paris, France)"
3,200 lb. weight limit,pro.s fits well and lockable and economical. Cons 200lb. weight limit meaning I cannot stand on it. It scratches easily which immediately rust. For the looks great but would have not bought if I had known about weight limitations.
2,"Cute, but not for easy children...","I love the Backyardigans but this book is not worth purchasing. The pull tab system they use is very difficult and hard for children to do themselves. The pull tabs are supposed to be pulled to two seperate settings but they get jammed easily (especially when pushing them back in). Needless to say, my book was broken the first day I received it."
3,"Cute, but flimsy","This book was cute, and my daughter loved it because she loves Backyardigans but it fell apart easy. The tabs fell bent and it was hard for her to work."
4,Cool pull tabs!,"I've never seen a book with pull tabs like these. You pull it and the picture ""moves"" in and out of an open ""box"" - usual. BUT when you pull it all the way it kind of clicks and when you push it back in, another picture moves in a different box. There are four such pages!DOH! I'm revising my review. IT BROKE!!! I pulled it out and didn't go far enough and now it is stuck. I tried to fix it but I'll have to tear the book open to do so. NOT COOL WHEN BROKEN!"
2,Way Overpriced!!,"I just received this crib set today and I must say that I am really disappointed! After paying $249 for a crib set (that didn't even come with a dust ruffle)I was really expecting alot more than I got. From other posters, it said it was soft??? The COLORS may be soft, but the material is not. Hopefully with several washes that will change. The Pooh wall hanging is cute but I would rather have the dust ruffle. On a good note, it is one of the cutest looking Pooh sets out there and can be used for a boy or girl. The blanket is very thin, but we have several other plush pooh blankets to add that will help keep our son warm, as it gets cold here in New England in the winter."
5,It was about time for a book of this caliber to be offered.,It was about time for a book of this caliber to be offered.I took great pleasure in reading a well written book by a Christian and actually understood how the story line developed and made since too me. I thank the author for having not only an outstanding imagination but also keeping with sound Christian believes in developing the story. It was refreshing to see no demonic charters were needed or some outrageous story line to capture your attention. I am looking forward to this author's next book.
2,Author Needs to Work on His Craft,"This book received great reviews here on Amazon. so I sprung for the whole series. What a mistake! The premise of the book promises to be a great story, and it probably is a great story, but the poor writing gets in the way. He obviously has not learned the writing mantra ""Show, don't tell."" I could not get drawn into the story because I'd constantly think, ""I can't believe he wrote that!!"" Also, Mr. Burton has made his book a soapbox for his particular theology which is quite irritating.I believe that Mr. Burton should hone his craft of writing and republish this book. Anything worth doing for the Lord is worth doing excellently."
3,its ok....,"this port of doom kinda dissapointed me when i purchased it years ago, i mean it isnt lacking anything from the old school pc version, but it really didnt offer anything more either. With the capabilities of the 32x it shouldve had a lot better graphics and controlls, instead it was almost identical to the pc original, which really dissapointed me when i was a kid and saved and saved to buy it thinking it was going to be the most awesome version of doom ever, after playing it i was really kinda bummed as i already had the pc version of it and couldve spent my money on somthing i didnt already own! We all know how long it took to save the kind of money these games cost as a kid! I still own it and still play it sometimes, because i dont own it on my pc these days, and it is a cool classic FPS, but i would reccomend getting the old school pc version before buying this one, as if you look online you can most likely download it for free :)"
4,"Looks good, works well, but seems cheap","The first thing you notice is how cheap the materials are when you receive these. I had no problem assembling these and attaching my Klipsch B3 speakers.Once assembled running a wire through it and out the hole in the bottom wasn't a problem on my carpet but it was close.They look nice with my speakers, just seem like they would be easy to destroy or break."
4,Solid Stand,"Good solid stand. I didn't like the spikes on the bottom for adjustments since I have a wood floor but I was able to find some flat head hex bolts that worked in their place. Running the wire through can kind of be tricky with the way the back is made, but everything now looks nice and clean."
3,WOMENS NIKE PRESTO DIGITAL CHRONO DATE WATCH,"Takes a likin' and keeps on tickin'. Well, NOT! I'm addicted to the design of these watches, unfortunetly it has a 1 year waranty for a reason. It dosen't last more than a year. But glutton for punishment that I am, I keep buying another so it must not be too bad."
3,Good,I got what I expected and the purchase was a good one. I have no further feedback or issues to report concerning this product.
5,Great Deal!,"A super beginners guitar for a super price. Comes with lots of extras too. It does come with cheap strings, so I recommend buying quality strings for it."
5,Simply love it !,"Good Starter Guitar, I played it straight out of the box.It came pre-strung with a grimy strings and I had to change the #5-B & the #6-E strings the same day.However the package had the following much to my surprise.1.

1,Oh those who plan on purchasing this DVD- beware!,"One star is not a rating of a film, but rather rating of DVD... Movie might be good, but I never got to watching it. The reason is that DVD is not playable. Nor by PS2, computer, DVD player or anything else. One of the reviewers recommends not to get ""Video Asia"" products, but any other Video Asia stuff worked. My advice is to watch out for a little label that says ""Fortune 5 DVD"". I purchased a DVD box called ""Martial Temple Collection"" that holds five DVDs... Four of them work well, but the one with Fortune 5 label doesn't work. Coinsidence? I don't think so."
4,"The Facts on File Dictionary of Mathematics, 3rd Edition","The Facts on File Dictionary of Mathematics, 3rd Edition, does have a few mistakes, and my daughter Elisabeth Shippee has had fun finding them. We have corresponded with the author(s) once in 2003 and they promptly responded with a detailed email; and we just sent them another email and expect a reply shortly.A handy reference book, with some mistakes, yes, but these are acknowledged by the author(s), to be fixed in a later edition. A good buy based upon the authors' willingness to follow up on correspondence regarding the book.Steven Shippeeshippee@jcs.mil"
4,Good work by a great author.,"John F. Bayer takes us to periscope depth with ""The Omega Deception"" and sometimes even spooks the socks off of us at times!Join Mark Shaw, a man who has lost everything, summoned to take on a most dangerous assignment. He becomes one of the SS, in an attempt to find a most secret and dangerous weapon that could indeed destroy the U.S. While taking on his role, he finds confidence in Kurt Daluege, discovering him to be a Christian in a most hostile environment. Shaw seeks nothing more than revenge against the despicable SS, yet comes to the realization that revenge belongs to our Father in Heaven.Prepare to meet the likes of Winston Churchill. Or maybe even feel what it is like for Heinrich Himmler to be under the likes of the icy darkness of Fuhrer Adolf Hitler. You'll also see names such as Wild Bill Donovan, on the creative side of Bayer's writing.A good read, but not the page turner I expected, fans of Bayer will be pleased with this work."
4,Durable seat covers,"I love the look of these covers, they are very fitted and have a very durable feel to them. The only problem I have with these are the stickers to hold the cover in place in the armrest compartment, within literally minutes the stickers came up so I have to find something alternative to hold it in place."
4,Fit the need,"These covers are elegant, and meet the need exactly. The color scheme isn't is not an identical match to the F-150 charcoal, but it looks great - it's a better charcoal scheme than the stock charcoal color in my 2004 pickup. It fits snug. About the only downside is the instructions for install - they could use some improvement. All in all, a fine product."
2,Incorrect information,"I am Russian and a teacher of Russian Language. There is no such word as ""razbliuto"" (!!!) in Russian! How I can trust that the words in other languages are correct? Obviously, native speakers have to evaluate this book."
2,Questionable,"I am not a native speaker of any language except English, so I cannot evaluate the veracity of these words. The entries look interesting, though often verbose. The chapters are not very helpful, though I don't know how else you would lay out a book like this. That brings up the index as the only remaining tool to tie the book together. However, the author has unfortunately used the index to promote the sources of her words (this could and should have been a line-entry under each word).With no way to find the words you are looking for; nothing to tie the multitude of entries of this book together, the best I can give it is two stars. Without an exceptional index this book cannot stand as a ""wordsmith's reference""; indeed, the best it can be is interesting or quirky.There must be better books out there."
3,A bit didactic,"I was turned off by Rheingold's opening to this book. I like etymology and playing with words, but I don't need to be told how to incorporate them into my life--or even that I should."
3,FOR FANS ONLY,"I think this was her first album. Never released in the states, I picked this up on a trip to Vienna. It was a must-buy. It sure did surprise me. The music is closer to that on ""The Wanderer"" than ""Bad Girls"". Not a trace of disco to be found. ""Born to Die' is a chugging little rocker that could have been a hit, in my opinion back in the 70's. ""Hostage"" is a story song that really should never have been put on record. The title song is really nice. ""Let's Work Together"" is another good song. Really the songs on this album are really not that memorable, but still I am glad I bought it. I was the envy of a few people that love Donna and did not know of this cd's existence."
4,Small but works,"This item looks big but the actual hood is a bit small. If you plan on using this item for roller sets, depending on the size of your rollers, your whole head may not fit in the hood like other bonnet dryers; hence the reason for the 4 stars. The different temperature settings are very convenient. I've owned this dryer for a little over a year and it has never giving me any trouble. It is very cute and easy to store away. Like I said earlier there is only one downfall with this product; If the hood was bigger it would be perfect."
5,Just as it says...,These are just as advertised. Good price for the net. Paper is not flimsy and fits easily into my calculator.
5,Best calculator/pos rolls,"We were having a huge problem at work with our calculators, which we use all during the day. Took us about half a year to understand what was going on. They were not printing readable numbers - we thought it was due to dust. At least once a week I had to clean the numbers on the roller with a toothbrush. I prefer not to go into the messy, not always successful, time consuming details! After researching online, it turned out that it was probably lint from the calculator paper. Bonded paper is lint-free. So I purchased these PM Company rolls to see if that was the solution. After about a month - all the residue lint disappeared, and we were finally able to read our numbers! All thanks to PM Company's well priced, well packaged, and delivered on time calculator rolls. I will purchase these again, and again, and again...... and recommend them to everyone who uses calculator and POS rolls."
5,Lot of tape for a little money,Not much to review. Twelve big rolls of adding machine tape for $8.19 (as of 7-24-11). These fit my Sharpe EL-1801pIII which is a fairly common adding machine. Bright white paper onto which the machine prints very clearly. I would recommend.**
1,Miller Newton Child Abuser,Before purchasing this book look for information on all the abuse he perpitrated and forced others to participate in
1,Miller promotes violence against drug users,". . . it was ""almost unbelievable"" that the director of the program, a man with ""supposedly"" strong credentials, would allow and condone the use of violence. ""We find the institution highly questionable and someone should look into it. We think there's something radically wrong.""--Secaucus, New Jersey Municipal Judge Emil DeBaglivo referring to Miller Newton (Straight's former national clinical director) upon convicting three of Newton's counselors for beating a client at Kids of North Jersey. ""We were basically breaking his will,"" one of the counselors admitted; also stating that Newton ""did tell us to do it."" [The Record (Hackensack), New Jersey, 12-24-93, p. D01]."
3,Read this on a recommendation...,"Sound ideas if you don't mind plowing through all of the stuff and fluff. The author spent way too much time trying to make his points compelling by the use of awkward and fanciful historical connections. Oh, and the liberal use of Capitalization To Play An Idea Up As A Fundamental Law Of The Universe gets annoying pretty quick.I recommend reading ""Lean Thinking"" instead. You'll get all of the same important concepts without the need for literary corn-husking."
3,RC,"I like that the book tells the story of Nimrod and his wife, but it fails to present some facts. Cush did not meet his wife on the streets. Cush made indecent acts with his daughter, which is how Nimrod came about, and as Nimrod grew older his sister/mother lusted for him and later they became husband and wife, through incest originating from Cush. There are other misinformed writings in this book, too many to write. Do your research first, then read the book and you'll see what I mean by leaving out facts."
3,too biblical,"Is not an imparcial book,there was a lot of wisdom down in Babilon(part of the cabbalah came from the magical books of babilon) but the book only shows the old and knowed biblical side of the history.In fact i was looking for another book of nimrod trough Amazon,but was impossible to find.Very strange..even the book maker didn't had a copy."
2,yawn,"I thought I'd give this book a try because it came up in connection to another author. However, I found it extremely boring. It started out with a lot of promise, but just didn't go anywhere. I've only gotten half-way through the book because I just can't stay interested."
4,Buy it for the Bruch!,"The Bruch was recorded c. 1970, a period when Rosand's technical polish and personal style were a nearly perfect amalgam. The impulse and drive in these performances, especially the Bruch, are tremendous. The orchestra support is better than the usual Rosand received. The live recordings are clear and relatively quiet considering their provenance. I'm less sanguine about the Paganini; thus the four stars overall. Buy it for the Bruch, which easily holds its own with Perlman and reminds me even more of Heifetz."
1,Stick with Tufte,Don't waste your time on this one. Get Ed Tufte's first two books. Wainer spends many pages regurgitating and adulating Tufte's previously published work--unfortunately with less clarity.
3,Not Great,"This work has been covered by Tufte Generally better, and Tuftes books are cheaper. The material is sound but the print quality in this book is not as good as Tuftes Graphic Press, The majority of the charts are reproduced in the text in black and white, while some are duplicated in color plates (many look like Photographs) the quality is very Variable. However the Subject is worth while and demands wider coverage, especially given the strange directions Tufte has taken in his 4th book , lets hope the Author will be encouraged to ""try"" again."
2,Cheaply made!,"The beads are too spaced out, not enough rows. You can hardly tell that the ying yang symbol is there. Not happy with this item. Would NOT recommend!! Does NOT look like picture at all!!"
5,"happy, charming, occasionally wacky","The Pascha Mass is happy, charming, occasionally wacky 18th Century hybrid of baroque conventions, dance rhythms & Czech folk music. Sleigh bells & some sort of double reed folk instrument like a Platerspiel or small bagpipe are used. The score itself makes little attempt to absorb & fuse the various styles. One type just moves into another; this Mass definitely has a ""Gloria"" apart from the worlds of Bach & Vivaldi in everything but joyful song; it is more like an aural assemblage. The Carols are fitting ""filler.""Hard to imagine anyone being better at this than Musica Bohemia & Jaroslav Krcek, who record for the Czech import labels Supraphon & Panton, which is probably where this recording originated. Edmund Pascha himself is bit of a mystery. The price is right. Even when Media Partners includes liner notes, they aren't very detailed & never have a libretto.Bob Rixon"
1,Garbage,"I'm no novice but I couldn't even install the hardware, never mind the drivers. The CD-in jack didn't fit on the J4 or J5 input on my (Intel 815e) chipset; and the card didn't seat properly in the PCI slot.Brought it back the same day and got the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz audio card. Installed like a dream and the sound ROCKS!Don't waste your time. The cheap price says it all - you get what you pay for."
2,Flawed and incomplete yet still a good read,"When this book came out, it was considered to be groundbreaking and astonishing as far as new information about Soviet operations goes. However, it is almost completely irrelevant. If one takes a close look at the book and compares it with ""The Mitrokhin Files"" (Mitrokhin being another KGB officer who defected several years later), it will be noted that much of the information Gordievsky SHOULD HAVE KNOWN if he really had access to all top Soviet files is missing. This, along with several other contradictory statements, leads us to conclude that the Soviets knew of Gordievsky's activities and so were using him to feed false and/or irrelevant information to the West."
5,Loved this book,"A relative gave me this book as a Christmas present. I could not put it down. KGB opened a new world for me. I was blown away by what the soviet revolution did to its own people.Murder on a massive scale. Who killed more Russians, Hitler's Army or Stalin and Lenin?It has been several years since I read this book, but I still remember the sections detailing how they took over the eastern block countries.People in Hollywood should read this book.Chris Shaker"
2,Inadequate,The main problem with this book is the presentation of the materal. It is a confused and jumbled narrative that lacks clear structure and looses the reader in minutia. It's as if the authors had no plan for organizing the material and are just information-dumping for 700 pages. I don't think one would have to look very hard to find a better-written work on the subject.Not recommended.
5,"Absolutely wonderful, but not absolutely easy","I completely agree with all the glowing reviews. Handknit Holidays is gorgeous to look at, and, even more importantly, the patterns are charming and elegant. I want to make up all of them now!That said, I have to warn my fellow beginning knitters that this is a fairly advanced book. In fact, although I just went to the bookstore to buy this book, I didn't end up bringing it home with me. It's just too hard for me right now.But there's always next Christmas!"
3,Is there an errata sheet?,"I am working Snegurochka's Party Hat on page 123. There seems to be an error in the chart. When I work (or count) row 31, I end up with 37 stitches in each of the three sections. But row 33 requires 36 stitches. Help! Has anyone else had this problem or am I losing it. I admit this is the first time I've knitted from a chart like this. In general, this is a lovely book to look at, but there are only a few designs I might try."
4,Very nicely done!,"I love all Melanie Falick's books and especially her photography. I highly recommend buying this book, but I would suggest looking at it first in a store to see if the patterns ""speak to you"". As far as I know, this book isn't marketed as ""for beginners"", so beginners beware! There are some simple patterns here however. One other issue I have with Melanie Falick, is that there seems to be lack of a website with an errata page on it, which is disturbing for some knitters. I throughly enjoy looking at the book for inspiration, and am currently making the tree skirt, and am very happy with the pattern so far. A beautiful book for any knitter's collection!"
4,Wonderful book,I got this book as a gift and I absolutely love it. It includes many inspiring projects through many knitting levels with beautiful photography. A word of caution: there are patterns that need clarification or corrections. I would recommend doing a search on a knitting site (like ravelry.com) to see if the project you are thinking about contains errors.
2,Definitely not for beginners,"I would like to give this book more stars but what is the point of a knitting book if one cannot follow the instructions very easily. This is no better than a picture book. Look how pretty, but forget about being able to knit it. I've tried two recipes and I am ready to toss this book, and I consider myself a pretty skilled knitter. The directions seem more as if they were just copied from someone's notes, comprehensible to its author only, and not clear and explanatory enough for everybody else to understand.Sloppily done, with really only a small handful of worthwhile recipes, if you can make any sense out of the directions."
5,Beautiful book,"This book has some unique, lovely patterns. Published a few years ago, was new to me, so compelling I had to buy it."
3,Its OK,This book is just OK. Not too happy with it. The bag in it is cute and that's about it; but that is what I bought the book for.
5,THIS BOOK ROCKS!!!,I love this book. The variety of patterns in this book are great. I can't wait to start knitting Christmas presents. I plan on making the ruffle scarf first.
1,Don't waste your money on this fan,"Can't say I should have expected much given the low price for this fan. The batteries were defective and one of the flimsy plastic blades broke off when when it touched my hand (a good safety feature I guess, but poor quality). Don't waste your time and money on this, despite the low price."
4,"It worked well for me, but.","I purchased both SG Tool Aid 87900 and Advanced Tool Design Model ATD-8562 Windshield Knife.Two side windows & one windshield are removed to date. The blade on the 87900 SG Tool Aid is starting to twist and will soon break.I could not have done what I have accomplished with out BOTH tools. The ATD is just a BIG RIGID utility knife and as such it uses standard utility knife blades. The instructions with both tools are virtually nonexistent. It took me a while to find the blade inside the handle of the ATD.The adhesive on the windshield was so wide I had to remove the dash and cut from both sides, over and over again!Will need more blades for the 87900 Amazon does not list them. Will post where to buy here if I find them."
2,broke 2 windshields with it,"Not necessarily the fault of the tool, they are offered all over the place. Probably more the problem that the adhesive holding windshields in place is so hard they are extremely difficult to remove under any conditions."
1,Be careful of albums with the same title...,"I was sent this album thinking it was a Harry ""Sweets"" Edison album. The album was some type of Latin American rubbish and I was very disapointed when I recieved it in the mail. I did however get a refund from the seller. I still havent seen the coverart to a Harry ""Sweets"" Edison Cd called Arte Amada. So i sill do not know if the album exists or not. So be care full with album titles and do your research before you buy."
5,Motorcraft YH1624 Damper Door Switch,"ExcellentThe part shipped to my house in 4 days and came in a Motorcraft box. The part itself fit perfectly, and resolved the issue."
5,"Worked great, but broke again a few months later...",This part got me through the worst of winter but turns out the problem is further down in the box and it keeps snapping the cable. I bought another part from a local dealer that has a year parts guarentee and just keep having it fixed at the cables snap. Before winter sets in again this year I'll take my car to a Ford dealer and get it fixed correctly.
3,Not so great.,"This review is for your average person. If you adore Rainbeau Mars you will hate this review, but I'm being really honest. I truly like all of Rainbeau Mars dvds except this one. Ra'yoka is similar to a Cameron Shayne dvd, without any detailed explanations of how to perform the movements. I find it strange that there are not many explanations and alignment cues, considering she is so talkative. The program is martial arts style moves mixed with yoga poses that we already know. It would earn 5 stars if it had a tutorial section. I am very disappointed. I gave it 3 stars because I may have been impressed by it, had I not seen Shayne's dvds first. The average viewer might feel the same. Sorry Rainbeau, but I would not recommend this to a friend. Rainbeau should stick to what she knows best; and I feel bad to say it is not this combination of movements. It appears that many of the non-yoga movements are new to her :("
2,Couldn't get into the book; left it unfinished,"Title of review says it all - just could not get past the socio--political commentary enough to get interested in the book, much less finish it. Will be going on the the next trip to the local used book store. Not Recommended"
2,Obvious,"This book will give you some statistics you might not have known, but other than that, skip it if you have any familiarity with development in third-world countries. Hard to believe anyone actually subscribed to many of the old dominant theories of development..."
5,Land Use pitched battles,"Fascinating treatment of the burgeoning struggle of urban sprawl (now exurban sprawl) vs. planned development in 21st century America. Another ""inconvenient truth, blending the source of the energy crisis, ""green"" concerns, local food production, and legal armageddon over eminent domain.Lively writing from a former Boston Globe reporter."
3,"GOOD STUFF, JUST NOT ENOUGH OF IT!","My rating on this book is rather middle of the road, simply because it did contain very inspiration and wise words, but there was nothing new here that cannot be found in many other self-help books. That is not to say there is anything materially wrong with the book, it just lacked originality and skimmed the surface of some very important issues. The author emphasizes the importance of inner beauty, a beauty born of blending mind, body and soul, and finding inner peace.If you are looking to expand your knowledge on the topics presented in this book, I highly recommend, ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle, ""Healing Society,"" by Dr. Seung-Huen Lee, and ""The Art of Happiness"" by the Dalai Lama. I found these books to be more in-depth and all are spiritually uplifting regardless of what your religious background or beliefs may be."
5,"Uplifting, fun book!","Love this book! Entertaining and fun. I bought one as a b'day gift for a friend, and she loves it, too!"
3,Not so much new,"I was really disappointed by Lit from Within. Amongst books of this type, it's rather cursory and a little self-serving. Very little new here. Try ""All the Joy You can Stand"" by Debrena Jackson Gandy for a real treat."
2,another ME book,At first I was enthralled but as the book went on it seemed more like one of those toddler books where each page shows some aspect of a child's day- My Breakfast- My Friends- My Bath. I really don't care to know what she has in her closet. How trite!! I agree with several of the other reviews. There is nothing new and seems to be more of an ego trip of a woman with too much time on her hands.
5,Best Spawn toy yet!,"I am a huge Spawn fan and love to collect and play with them! Since I bought a Redmeer like 2 years ago i have been looking for an origanal Spawn toy, I got it! So I bought this toy and can't go anywhere without it! Now with my Redmeer and Spawn toy i can play with them! It truely is the best Spawn toy yet!P.S. Doesnt move a lot of parts!"
1,Was broken upon opening,"I seriously hope I missed something here, or I misplaced the instructions, but the box was opened and the leg fell off as soon as the plastic surrounding hte figure was removed. I've tried to pop it back in but it seems like the leg was never meant to be attached. I'm very displeased. I've never had a problem like this with one of McFarlane's toys before."
2,Cool,"I gave this toy two stars for fun because there is not a lot of body parts that can move, but I have a big imagination, so I thought it was really fun. I gave it three stars for durability because no parts on my action figure broke, but a lot of people are telling me how the arm broke off or the leg broke off. I definitely don't think it's educational because Spawn isn't exactly the best role model or even superhero, since he kills a lot of people and stuff like that. Although this doesn't have to do with the toy, just so you know, the Spawn comics are NOT for kids."
5,A lovely collection of short pieces,"""Famous Violin Miniatures"" brings together a wonderful collection of 12 classical pieces by a variety of composers: Claude Debussy, Charles Gounod, Antonin Dvorak, and more. The music is performed by Aladar Mozi on violin, accompanied by Danica Moziova on piano. Together they bring a lot of emotion to these pieces.The overall tone of the collection is sad but sweet. The pieces that made the biggest impression on me: Christoph Willibald Gluck's Melody from ""Orfeo""; Mozart's elegant Minuet in D Major; N. Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Song of an Indian Merchant""; Fritz Kreisler's upbeat, playful ""Beautiful Rosmarin""; and the fast, exciting ""Romanian Dance,"" composed by none other than Aladar Mozi (I don't know if he's the same Mozi credited as violinist, but it seems likely). I don't know much about classical music, but I do know that this is a great CD."
3,Abridged versions of the originals,"This CD has many of Grupo Niche's greatest hits, and the sound quality is fine.The buyer should be aware that pretty much all the songs are cut short compared to the original - up to 2 minutes per song.Do the cuts make the songs better or worse? I am not completely sure one way or the other (you won't notice that the cuts are there unless you know the original very well), but I'm sure purists will have something to say about it.BTW, there's at least one other Grupo Niche compilation apparently with the same abridging job."
3,Not his best,"Disappointing if you have the rest of his CDs, like me. It's not awful, but doesn't match up to his other output. Interesting to hear earlier versions of a couple tunes. Sound quality uneven as you would expect."
5,Beware the Advertising Copy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The saw itself seems well made and solid although I don't have it set up yet.Shipping was fast and the product seemed well-packed.I have dealt with CPO-Delta customer service and the rep was polite and helpful.BEWARE THE AMAZON LISTING FOR THIS ITEM. My saw was delivered WITHOUT A STAND. I called CPO to inquire and was advised (politely and helpfully) that this saw 'doesn't come with a stand.' The rep explained that Amazon had 'gotten the listing wrong.' The rep said that CPO had been trying to correct the problem 'since Christmas' but that Amazon had not corrected it.Bottom Line: Saw seems fine; CPO seems fine; IF HAVING THE STAND IS IMPORTANT TO YOU DON'T BUY FROM THIS AMAZON LISTING.
2,Bad,"The sound produced can get pretty loud but as soon as you start turning up the distortion the quality nosedives. The thing broke when I lightly tossed it onto a pillow. A pillow! Come on. I mean I know you shouldn't be tossing amps around, but this thing broke way too easily."
1,Hightower Oval dessert/soup spoon,"Because the outside edges of this spoon aren't sufficiently polished, it feels like the edges are cutting the inside of your mouth with each spoonfull."
2,"Nice Picture, Disappointing Product","We bought this pattern 30 years ago for our wedding. The pic looks the same, but the spoon (and fork) are comparatively lightweight and lacking the buffed finish of the original; feels tinny in your hand. I would have been happy to pay more. I really don't think it's reasonable that the price 30 years later should be the same. Buying online will take a hit if it is typified by this kind of pictorial representation posing to be the original item. We'll save these for the picnic basket and continue looking for the well made original."
1,You don't always get what you pay for.,"...They didn't cancel out as much noise as the cheaper ones, and the sound quality from the headphones was much worse than that of any other ones I've tried. They cut out nearly all the high pitches from the music/DVD I listened to while trying them out.The only good thing I can say about these is that they were fairly comfortable, and I like that the battery was actually in the headphones and not in the cord.Regardless, I plan on returning the pair I purchased and buying something else."
1,It doesn't work!,"I installed the battery, turned it on, the red light came on and everything, but it doesn't do squat. I even had 3 friends try it to see if they could tell any difference, but other than a slight hiss when they're on, I can't tell any difference between on and off.As for sound quality, I tried them plugged in to a cd player and the sound was acceptable, enough bass, but the treble was lacking.I am going to return mine."
1,A disappointing product,"I bought these hoping that they would help me work in a room with a TV playing by listening to music. They were totally ineffective. The noise canceling feature was JUST noticeable i.e. there was a barely detectable difference between ON and OFF. But the frequency response was poor - almost no upper register which made listening to music hardly bearable even with TV off. I returned them for credit,"
2,Not worth it,"Incredibly poor treble response. Noise cancellation nearly non-existent. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. Mine are going back."
4,Great Value!!!,"..., these headphones are a great value. For [the money], these headphones can turn a long flight into a more enjoyable one. I tried these out on a couple of flights and boy was I impressed. I am one who can appreciate good sound. The noise cancellation was about 85% effective which is good considering I am on an airplane. Works really well with widebody aircraft entertainment systems (i.e. Boeing's 777/767). If buying for other than travelling, I recommend another type of headphone. Last but not least...comfortable. More comfortable than the Aiwa HPCN5. Enjoy!!"
3,The truth about sound cancellation,"First of all this review aplies to all headphones (over-the-head, on or over your ear headphones) that ""actively"" cancell noise i.e. w/ electronics. They are only made to reduce certain frequencies, talking isn't among them, however, things like airplane roar, computer noises (hisses and such) and reduced. This aplies even to extremely expensive headphones like the Bose Quiet Comfort (250-299 depending on new or old version) which act the same way. This explanation also helps in figuring out a reason why some people report NO cancelling (probably using them w/ wrong frequencies) why some say they're wonderful, most who say that talk about airplane roar being reduced, the thing their meant to do. I hope this clears up some of the mystery about active noise cancellation headphones"
2,Could be better,"I'm not an audiophile and have no complaints about the audio quality. However, I found the active noise cancellation to be less effective than I hoped. These headphones knock out perhaps half the engine noise. That still leaves a lot of noise! Without these, the engine noise was quite fatiguing and left me with a headdache; with the headphones, the noise is merely unpleasant and I can still function. There is a noticeable difference in engine noise level with the active cancellation on and off. Other, higher frequency noises (voices, etc) are not quieted by the active cancellation. For these noises, the Jensen's are no better than reqular, passive headphones.I agree with other reviewers that the retracting switch is poor quality. Requires a lot of fiddling to push just right so the cord retracts. Battery life is no problem."
2,Sound quality bad-canceling okay,"The noise cancellation eliminated the hum from computer fans, window fans, etc, or reduced it significantly...but the sound quality coming out of these things was really bad. I'm not even a super-anal audiophile, but I at least like to hear the highs and the lows...this headphones sound like the upper ranges are coming through a jar, and the lower rangers are muffled a little as well. The cancellation just isn't worth the bad sound quality."
5,Great Product! Amazing Value!,"I had been looking for a pair of Noise Canceling Headphones and jumped on this deal when this pair went on sale at Amazon. The noise cancel feature is great! I mean, the noise cancelling is not 100%, but there is no better for under $50. Additionally, the collapse feature makes them very easy to take on trips or throw in the gym bag. Well worth the price!"
3,Decent for the money,"I got them for under $20 here at amazon. Simply could not pass up on the deal. They don't cancel out everything, only certain frequencies. For example, they won't do anything against a TV, but against a fan, it will quiet it down by quite a bit. Sound quality is iffy. I think someone else here posted a review saying that they were too bassy, and I would have to agree fully. I bought them just for recent travels and if you need some cheap noise cancelling headphones just to relax, maybe listen to a little music these are a good deal considering the very low price."
1,can not block the fans noise from my server,I bought this one to cancel the server's noise in my cube. Turns out to be waste of money. Not any better than the regular headphone I already have. Also not quite comfortable.
3,okay for the price,"i had these headphones for about two days and i really liked the sound quality and the noise canceling worked great.<br />the only downside was that they didn't stay on my head tightly enough and kept falling off.<br /><br />except for that, these would be great headphones to buy for home use and... u can't argue with the price! :D"
3,Ok for the price,These work fairly well for the price I paid. Over the long-term they are uncomfortable. The hinges on top that allow folding also cause some pain. The ear wells are shallow and make your ears sore after a while. They work well enough for a few hours of mowing.
2,Comfort not part of the comfortable price,"I had to review this simply because it was not that great. The noice cancelling did its job, the sound quality was ok, but a little to the bass side, but the way the headphones sat on your head is just uncomfortable. Its plastic head thing that folds nicely into a pouch is annoying because the crack at which you fold the headphones sometimes gets your haird caught in it and pulls it out when taking them off. With me having glasses, I often have to readjust headsets often because they push the sides of my glasses to my head too much, causing discomfort. So with me having to readjust them, I often pull out hairs! And just the plasticky hard feel to them--it's just not comfy.I'll admit that I got quite a bargain of ten bucks for this item, but I would never pay 40 bucks for headphones like these, especially without a cushioned headband that others, for cheaper prices, often offer."
5,Daughter loves it,My daughter loved getting this for Christmas. It gives us more choices for our family movie nights. Will be looking for more movies soon.
5,AnimeFanGirl - DVD's - Collection,I Purchased The Barbie Mariposa and her Butterfly Fairy Friends Moviefor My Sister's Little Girl to Watch at My House Win She What's TheI Love The Artwork in All of The Barie Movie's and My Favorite Movie's Are1. Barbie Princess Charm School Movie2. Barbie & The Diamond CastleBarbie Mariposa
2,o.k.,"I eagerly bought this movie for my four year old. We were expecting to enjoy it as we LOVED The Island Princess. We were also disappointed. The skeezites are scary and my daughter also asked me to skip those parts. The eating of the fairies wasn't necessary, and could have been done differently. This movie will definitely be shelved for a while. That being said, the imagery and colors of the movie are beautiful, which would be the only reason we would dare to watch it again."
3,not the best,"I knew my daughter was a little young for this dvd (only 4), but I gave in because she begged me for it. Nice marketing job they are doing! Anyway, she may grow into it. I don't think it's because it's too scary. I'm not sure what it is."
2,Why not hire true Hispanic actors?,"My girls liked this movie, but I couldn't help but notice that all of the Hispanic characters were voiced by non-Hispanic actors. Are there not plenty of Hispanic actors looking for work?"
1,Too scary and oddly animated,This was the first time that my daughter and I had watched a Barbie movie (of any type) and we were disappointed. My daughter exclaimed it was too scary - the skeezites (sp) eat the butterfly faries and the characters are catty and pretentious. If one was 13 I would expect it would be ideal.Also - something didnt ring quite right with the accents. And the characters spoke as you would expect them too - that is - they reformed to stereotype. This is something that i feel is wrong = especially as at 4 years old they are establishing opinions that have a long lasting effect. It seems to be narrated by someone who has english as a second language. (no offence to anyone) - but the dialogue is slimplistic and trite.
1,CHEAP,"way to scary and disturbing for little girls. Monsters trying to eat fairies is just not fun. Also production not even in the same ballpark compared to 12 dancing princeses, Swan Lake or Princess and the Pauper. No singing, no songs, not even as pretty as mermadia or island princess. Clearly this was a rush job to make money. Very dissapointing.In the past, they have used Martin Short, Kelsey Grammer, The NYC Ballet, Real Mozart, Beethoven and Tchaichowski music....and in Mariposa? Just cheapness."
2,my kids like it (but it is not one of the best barbie movies),"They are releasing a sequel soon, my children enjoy the movie but there is no singing, but it is still far better than barbie thumbellina"
5,YES,It is exactly like it was described on the site. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something like this. Very pleased with my purchase. My daughter is crazy in love with the movie. Finally some Mom-Time alone!
3,fine,"We like the movie, since we have 3 little girls and they all love to watch it once in a while and relax a little from playing."
2,Unhappy with Condition,"The condition of the disc stated that it was supposed to be in 'very good' condition. When my daughter put it in the video player it stopped within seconds after the opening credits. Much to my surprise when I looked to see what the problem was, there were some major scratches on the disc. I cleaned it with the disc cleaner we use for damaged/dirty discs, and still it will not work without stopping. I paid a few dollars more for this disc - using the 'condition indicator' as my guide to which disc I will purchase...has always worked for me in the past as I have purchased many used movies and audio books online. Very disappointed..."
3,Only worked once,"I agree with other reviews. The skeezites are a bit scary for children and my 5yr. old and 3yr. old did talk about it, but did not ask me to fast forward through those parts. We did however, have problems with it after purchasing yesterday. It does not work in our machine. My husband was able to get it to work one time yesterday and today, I can't get it to work. It is going back to the store today."
5,Cute Movie,"Have two daughters, ages 2 and 3, and they love Barbie. I thought this movie was really cute. Both girls will sit down and watch the entire movie which is a shock given their ages."
4,Cute,Cute movie. Not Barbie's best movie....my 5 y.o. loves all the others. But we're glad to have it in our video library.
2,Just Okay,"In keeping with the Fairytopia storylines, the Fungi in the other movies were scary looking but funny. The skeezites were just scary looking. My 5yr. old was okay with it but my 3yr. old did cuddle up once she saw them. It also seems that they need to put more effort into the plots. And I also had some problems with the dvd. It stalled a couple of times."
4,A good book,"The book is very precise and gives a lot of mathematical related things that's relevant to Navigation and Guidance. I somehow liked it's approach, mainly because it avoids a lot of descriptory jargons and talks straight in mathematics: the language of scientists and engineers! Before reading the book, a good hold of the mathematics related to system theory would be a definite plus. However, the book has an introductory chaper for the relevant mathematics too."
3,Good as a complementary book,"This book is good as a complementary book and I was glad that I bought it. The good about the book is that there is a definition for most of the variables and the equations are clear. The bad is that part of the material is missing, and the reader should refer to other books and articles to complete the knowledge."
5,A touching and emotionally satisfying film!,"The subtle yet powerful influence this little creature has over the lives of the humans he comes in contact with makes for an entertaining and thought provoking film. The performances of Ribisi, Collins and Caan are great! The supporting cast is also excellent and includes a sweet bit by Don Cheadle as Ribisi's therapist. Watch this film with someone you care about-smiles, hugs and a few tears of joy will be assured!"
1,MESSED UP DVD,THE DVD I WAS SENT HAS CHAPTERS OF THE MOVIE RECORDED/BURNED OUT OF ORDER. NOT A GOOD PURCHASE HERE AT ALL!!!!
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Being a huge fan of the Anniversary's ""Designing a Nervous Breakdown,"" I was initially put off by their songs on this split because of the drastic change in style. Having given the songs some time and a chance to prove themselves, they mostly seem to prove that their authors want to be John Lennon. ""Anais"" rings awfully close to ""I'm Only Sleeping"" by the Beatles, and ""Up In the Sky"" similarly reeks of Lennon influence (not that there's anything wrong w/him or the Beatles). Granted, these are enjoyable enough songs (which is the point of music anyway, right?), but it feels a bit like ""let's play dress-up"" or a caricature. Also, I feel the Anniversary did a better job crafting songs with this style on ""Your Majesty.""The Superdrag songs are listenable enough, but I bought this for the Anniversary tracks."
3,Different,"This release certainly suprised me. The Anniversary completely changed their style from powerful melody driven emo to unfocused 60's sounding stoner music. Although the songs were not that bad, they could not compare to tracks on ""Designing a Nervous Breakdown."" Gone were the intense, focused emo vocals and beautiful instumentation. In its placed was light, airy pop that lacked definition. The lyrics did not impress me either and left me wondering what they meant by them. Vagrant said ""it will be considered a classic in no time"", but by whom. I personally like progressive sounding emo instead of 60's influenced rock. However, i enjoyed the Superdrag songs. Superdrag penned thoughtful lyrics and played good, driving mainstream rock. Although only a trio, Superdrag uses their instruments to their potential to create varied songs with catchy hooks and great melodies. I would suggest listening to the MP3's before you decide to buy because it is not for everybody."
3,Inspiring,"If I consider this dvd as an inspirational dvd, I'd give it five stars: unique style, attractive and well played combos. Otherwise, if I consider this dvd as an instructional one, I'd give it only one star: many difficult combos are demonstrated only two or three times without giving you the chance to understand the machanics of the movements. Furthermore, Fayzah doesn't show you the movements from the back not even with a mirror.The zill section is very poorly done and doesn't give you any explaination for the most common rhythms.Definitely I'd suggest this dvd to a tribal fusion addicted bellydancer who is looking for new ideas."
3,Ok But Not Great,"Let me begin by saying that I think Fayzah is an AMAZING dancer and a great inspiration to watch. I was really looking forward to getting this. With that being said, I have been studying Tribal for a year and this is not a ideal DVD for a beginner. It moves very quickly so if you don't have any understanding of the Tribal vocabulary, do yourself a favor and save this DVD for later once you have all your basic ducks in a row.I also found the way that everything was laid out to be a bit awkward. For instance there were minor drills in the warmup (or did the warmup suddenly become a drill... I can't say as that was not clear). Then she suddenly goes into a variety of movement but the breakdowns seem rushed and the video editing itself not very inspiring. Also, the fact that I can hear her breathing at times is a bit distracting.Over all I am happy that Fayzah is sharing her great talent with us but I wish it was presented better so it would be easier to absorb. Hopefully next time."
3,Hope you know what you're doing,"I was being generous when I gave it 3 stars - more like 2.5. This goes fast! You must have a background in belly dancing in order to keep up. I can dance, but with some of the belly dance moves that are new, she doesn't go over them enough before moving on. I even paused the DVD at times in order to practice the moves over and over but after that, when she shows the routine, it is rushed over and I don't get to exaggerate or actually do the move properly. I wound up getting frustrated and gave up."
2,not an instructional dvd,"do not purchase this dvd if you are wanting instruction on how to do these techniques. all of the techniques listed on the dvd are shown once in a broken down form. then she goes straight into the move at full speed. each move is worked on about twice then she moves on to the next one. this is more of a demonstration dvd than an instructional dvd. fayzah is a wonderful dancer,but as far as teaching this dvd is not a good one to purchase. if you allready know these moves and want a little more demonstration, than this is for you. if your like me and a beginner looking for something to view to help practice between classes,skip this one. i did like the zill section but other than that im disappointed."
2,not my cup of tea,"After viewing once, I do not pick it up again.It seems she keeps talking more than getting us to drill on the techniques.Talking is not a problem but please give us some time to learn from the talks by drilling instead of moving on immediatley to other things.Just not my type; guess others may like it."
1,Western,"This one is bad. I am a big fan of Randolf Scott and never thought I would stop watching one of his movies but I did on this one. Maybe it was his first. I am glad he got better. Can't say much more, except don't bother with this one."
5,perfect size,I purchased this for a small backpack/diaper bag for my toddler. It is a good size for the things he needs and he can carry it if I don't over fill it. Good Quality and expandable.
1,Didn't work for me,"In preface, I am a great fan of Amazon.com & Puritan's Pride, the latter was the seller of this product - I struggled through all but one of these packets in search of some relief ... and found absolutely none ... and no side benefits such as Ginkgo promises. Know that on beach vacations, I have no allergies, asthma, related problems but where we live was/is cnsidered the USA #2 allergy capital and there's some reaction to indoor cats. Thus, I found NO improvement nor ANY relief from these assualts, although Promoting Respiratory Health was the hook that got me to buy. Additionally, this product did not enhance memory nor circulation - except in the sense that one would remember it's foul taste and circulate away from taking it if not dedicated as a believer in its promotional literature. I will give it this - it IS probably all natural - like tree bark."
1,"Great when it is working, but................","This is an amazing color printer - fast and perfect color reproduction. However there is a serious flaw with the toner cartridges. We have had toner leak out of two of the color cartridges, covering the inside of the unit with the powder. This was not due to installing the cartridge incorrectly since they both worked fine for 3-4 months before the problems occurred. It is nearly impossible to clean out all the toner powder from inside the printer (my company has outstanding IT support and they have given up). Everything now prints with a hazy yellow background. Our IT guys contacted HP and they deny the problem, but if you search the web you will find many other folks with the same problems. Between the down time, the cost of replacing the cartridges (around $250 each), the mess (we still have a magenta spot on the floor) and now the printing problems I have to recommend avoiding this printer until this problem is corrected."
1,Total Garbage,We've had this printer at my office for about 2 1/2 years. It's a giant waste of money. Magenta cartridges spew toner everywhere. Cyan cartridges streak. It's even worse when you use the manual feed. HP has no answers because they deny all the issues. HP's support is lackluster at best anyway. The first time when this machine was under warranty it took me three weeks worth of phone calls to get anything accomplished with them. Stay away from this printer at all costs. If you own one it makes a nice doorstop or paperweight. This is totally unacceptable considering toner and printer costs. I expect more from a product with the HP brand stamped on the box. To bad you can't give 0 stars.
1,Magenta toner leaks on this model,Obviously HP has a design flaw on the magenta cartridges. I have also experienced leakage from only the magenta (why only this one?)
1,"HP 4600 Expensive, Worst Investment, NO HP Support","My department has had this printer for a few years and for the last year it sat unused because the toner leak problem ""renders"" it useless. We have even used it a few times with the smears and it developed a horrible noise. We paid to have it cleaned and adjusted, which worked for a month. We cannot afford to pay this much again for so little productivity. My opinion is that HP should have had a recall on this model. I really like HP a lot but will question HP in the future and am now looking at reviews of other printers before we consider replacing the useless behemoth. Very, very disappointing. [if zero stars was an option here it would get it]"
1,Wide Multi-Color Page Streaks Render Printer USELESS.,Printer has had very light use and suddenly developed mostly magenta & cyan toner leaks. The excess toner is streaked and transfered to every page resulting in full length page striping. The print outs are absolutely useless for presentation and barely useable for drafts. HP denies there is a problem however I see that I am not the only one with this issue. Won't buy HP again. This is clearly a defective product design. There is no resolve. Your printer is now an expensive and rather large doorstop.
2,HP LJ4600 Quality issues with cartridges and support,"Now we have this printer for nearly 2 years in office use, and before purchase we find that this printer has a good price per printout. But noone expected that some of the cartridges make stripy printout (with black, cyan and margenta)when the cartridge is only 50% used.... so the price per page doubles due to some misconstructed cartridges.The support is also annoying - noone feels resonsible for this problem and the printout price rises by 100%We won't buy another HP color printer"
1,Same as the others,Powder from the toner cartridges get all over the inside of the printer and then ruins every page that is printed. Every page that is printed from my printer has a greyish color due to the powder dirt inside. It is impossible to clean it since the powder is everywhere. The only way to get it clean would be to bring it to a car wash (obviously this would leave the printer with bigger problems than page color). What a waste of money!!! Good thing my office bought it and not me or I would be furious.
3,Half the battery for half the price,It lasts about 1-1/4 hours in our CPx after the first charging. Enough to move it from plug to plug still alive but not much more. I've had some simultaneous trouble with waking our laptop from sleep-- not sure if the battery could be a cause...
4,Beautifully Done,"Nicodemos was born with the name of Nicholas Kallivourtsis on the Aegean island of Naxos in the year 1749. He studied at the `Gospel School' on the island of Smyrna where he majored in Greek, Italian, & French. Later the Turks invaded the Island & Nicholas returned to Naxos to become a secretary to the Metropolitan of Paros & Naxos. In 1775 he left the world behind to become a monk on the Mount Athos where he changed his name to Nicodemos. He wrote many writings, his most famous were his help in the editions of the ""Philokalia"" (a collection of early Patristics) & ""The Rudder"" (a commentary of Eastern Orthodox Cannons). This book ""Nicodemos of the Holy Mountain"" is his own personal reflections on acquiring the divine virtues. Nichdemos died in 1809. Paulist Press does another fine job with its series `The Classics of Western Spirituality'. Makes a great gift for your Priest or Spiritual pastor."
5,an entertaining and compelling must read!,"I loved this book and couldn't put it down! Captivating from beginning to end, The Migrant is drama, suspense, and love story all rolled into one. The plot is original, creative and heart-warming with characters you love and despise, but all of whom you can relate to.The twists and turns in this story can be viewed as fate or coincidence, depending on your beliefs. In either case, it leaves you thinking about choices you can make, things you can control, and relationships you can nurture, which lead to ultimate happiness..."
5,A MUST-READ FOR ALL FEMALE LAWYERS!,"Congratulations on the fantastic book, Ms. Blohm and Ms. Riviera!"
5,Good stuff,"Light in flavor, not bitter at all. If you like the sort of tea often served in Chinese restaurants, this is a good choice (not to mention, pretty cheap!)."
3,Pretty Good,"I bought this book thinking it would be another great series like Fearless. However, there isn't as much action as one might find in the Fearless series. There is a lot of talk and high school drama. The novel is sometimes hard to follow along with i.e when Chloe dies. The scene where she dies is very brief with no substance. She just falls and um that's it!?! Chloe and her actual powers don't seem to be the actual ""meat"" of the book. It's more about Chloe and her friends treating her badly. I feel Chloe and her powers should have been further developed. This book was just okay and by no means a must read."
1,NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!,"this book is an awful book. for one thing, it is a horrible story. for another, it is completely NOT appropriate for anyone under fourteen. it comments on things such as crack, alcohol, making out, periods, crotches, breasts, and worst of all, teens having public sex. i mean really... does anyone want to read something that cusses every two sentences and talks about that? i know i dont. i hated it and it is awful."
1,Not Worth The Money,"I bought this book after watching the fist two episodes of the TV series. I really like the series and thought the book would be even better. I was very disappointed. The characters in the book spend way too much time drinking, dropping the F bomb, thinking about sex, and doing things they shouldn't. I'm pretty open minded, but I wouldn't let my teenagers read this book. This is too bad because the storyline is creative and has so many possibilities. I think it could be really great without all the extra ""stuff"". I ended tossing the book before finishing it. I think I will just stick to the TV series."
5,"1 LIFE DOWN, 8 MORE TO GO!","I DIDN`T EXPECT TO ACTUALLY LIKE IT, BUT SO MANY PEOPLE HAD SAID IT WAS GOOD, SO I THOUGHT, OK, I`LL TRY IT. IT ISN`T THE TYPE OF BOOK I USUALLY READ, BUT I COULDN`T PUT IT DOWN. IT`S ABOUT A 16 YEAR OLD GIRL WHOSE TWO BEST FRIENDS START DATING SHORTLY AFTER FALLING 200 FEET FROM COIT TOWER AND SURVIVING. SHE STARTS TO FEEL NEGLECTED. THEN HER LIFE STARTS CHANGING DRAMTICALLY. SHE GETS A NOTE THREATNING HER LIFE SIGNED ""A FRIEND"". SHE HAS A STALKER, AND GUYS START LIKING HER. PLUS THE FACT THAT SHE HAS CLAWS, AND THE SUDDEN ABILITY TO RUN, JUMP, AND FIGHT.I CAN`T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONE!"
5,Love It!,"I love this book! It really is my favorite book! I give it too many stars to describe! Five isn't enough! I also love the show, but the book is slightly better! I LOVE THIS BOOK! Somebody comment if you like Alec more than Brian!"
3,Good to pass the time with,"This is a fun story about Chloe King, who once had a normal life until she survived an impossible fall and her best friends that she knew forever started going out with each other. Oh, yeah. And she grew claws and became as fast and agile as a cat. I don't think this is really an original story. She gets powers. Has a boyfriend like her, and another one that is part of an organization that tries to kill her kind. I mean, it just doesn't seem new at all. This is fun to read and everything, but its definitely not one that I would want to read over and over again.(Reviewed by Rachel R. 14)"
5,I disagree,I disagree with the lady who wrote the review. This book is definitely a page turner. Also it's wonderful because it's great to reread (I've read it 3/4/5 times). The second and third books are also great with wonderfully twisty plots :)!!! The one downside is that there isn't a fourth one yet. (every time I remember that I sigh :( How sad!)Overall the nine lives books are definitely 5 star worthy!!!
4,Awesome book,"This book was very good. Usually I just pick up random books with interesting titles/summaries from the library, and I have struck gold with this book. Chloe is an average teenager, (except for the fact that she has 9 lives), and I can definitely relate to this book, being a 14-year-old. The only thing that took one star away from my rating was the fact that I didn't really like the fantasy part of the book, like when she is getting attacked, because that is just not my taste, but the rest of the book was awesome and I look forward to the other 8 books in this series."
2,Big disappointment,"Wretched packaging - cheap, graphically amateur-looking, bizarrely designed - and dubious sound in places, though it's a nostalgia kick if these are the versions you grew up with. As another reviewer mentioned, the Stones albums have been lovingly restored, remastered, and repackaged for CD release. Why does Capitol insist on treating the Beatles catalogue so shoddily?"
2,Inferior US Releases,"I borrowed The Capitol Albums Vol. 1 from the library and am glad I didn't buy it. Other than nostalgia, there is no reason for this set. The mini artwork is too small and fuzzy to be appreciated. It's better to have an old copy of the original LP.The English albums released on CD in the 1980's have (on average) four more songs than their inferior American counterparts. The stereo mixes invariably have the vocals in the right channel and the drums and bass in the left. The mono mixes are indistinguishable from the mixes released in the 1980s.If you have the original CDs, keep them. If you're new to The Beatles, buy the original British releases and Past Masters 1 & 2.[DW]"
1,A shoddy release-the Beatles deserve better,"Capitol has to be the most scurrilous record company in the history of recorded music. It's unfortunate that they hold the rights to the best act in music history. This release is shocking in its appalling lack of taste. It's almost as if they REFUSE to do a good job with the Beatles catalog because they know the Beatles will sell no matter what piece of [...] they put out.Every other act from the sixties (except Capitol's own ""Kingston Trio"") has gotten a respectful remasters treatment.Why they can't do this with the Beatles is beyond me. The huge shocker on this set is the release of the horrible ""Something New"". ""A Hard Day's Night"" and mediocre filler material without the film's three best tracks ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""I Should Have Known Better"". Has Capitol ever heard of ""bonus tracks""? Come on! Beatle fans deserve to hear these classic tracks in stereo and this project gave Capitol a good opportunity to release them."
4,FINALLY!,"What the h*@% took Capitol/EMI SO LONG?! Actually, I think we all know most of the reasons. EVERYTHING ""officially"" Beatles-related takes AGES to be approved by the various entities involved, not the least of which is the Beatles themselves.At any rate, I say ""better late than never!""If you are old enough to remember the original Beatles ""invasion"" of the U.S. in 1964, then you will appreciate hearing these songs as they sounded then (actually better!) and also IN THE ORDER THEY ORIGINALLY APPEARED ON LP.Capitol/EMI finally correct a BIG error in judgement, and the truth is that they could have done this MUCH sooner.Minor gripes: the included booklet is virtually worthless, containing no information on the mixes used, etc. Of course, all this info can be found elsewhere, but still...I'm deducting one star for missed opportunities in packaging and timing."
2,"awkward, cheap packaging doesn't do justice to the music","Capitol's creative team should take a cue from the folks at Rhino, who know how to lovingly package old material. While it's hard to argue with the release of the Fab Four's first four albums issued in the States (and it's nice to have the stereo and mono versions), this is vastly overpriced and aimed at triggering Pavlovian instincts in Beatles fans, who are yearning for the old covers and the old Capitol rainbow label. The skinflints at Capitol aren't just satisfied with squeezing last drop from the franchise; they must also shortchange fans with a substandard, flimsy packaging that is awkward to use. I bought the collection at a big-box retailer, apparently at near cost -- and still I'm disappointed. The packaging is cheap, plain and simple. I would recommend buying the previous British-album issues in jewel cases, mono or no mono."
4,Some Random Thoughts,"In the end, there are pros and minuses to this box set. Having more stereo mixes are welcome, as I think they provide more spacious definition of instruments than the mono. Some of the fake stereo with the delay and reverb on some of the tracks may be objectionable. I discovered these albums back in the 70's, and I thought the fact that the singles were used on these lp's were great, because I didn't have to track down all those 45's. I liked the fact I could listen to them on full length lp's without changing records every 5 minutes. Past Masters ironically, can also be considered a piecemeal release. Having these songs in a form as orignally experienced is a consideration. Still, I don't know how far they can go with this series box set projects, as I was never a fan of movie soundtracks, as on the original US Help and Hard Day's Night."
2,The Capitol Albums Vol. 1,"The Capitol Albums Vol. 1The Beatles The Capitol Albums Vol. 1. The sound is excellent. But the packaging is extremely terrible. This edition is a mockery of the Beatles and looks like very mediocre low priced one which must be distributed free to the poor Beatle maniacs. Please, Capitol - EMI look at the Japanese editions of Vol. 1 and Vol. 2! Probably the Japanese love and respect the Beatles much more than you!"
4,Not all songs included!,"Bought vol. 1 and 2 as a birthday gift for someone. Thought all songs would be there, but I know of two that were not included. Misery and There's a place were not on this! I believe they should have included all the capitol releases!"
3,Packaging by Dummies,Whoever designed this package should be fired or go to work for K-Tel. The errors are countless and beyond stoopidity.
1,Nothing learned in 40 years except greed.,"Why bother? The UK versions are better value and are as the band meant them to be heard. The US versions are poor value, cannabilised versions of the real thing. This rubbish was a rip off in the 60's, don't fall for it again."
3,What is Capitol thinking?,"We all know the music. Superb. Historic. Capitol has again done a very poor job in ""packaging"" (i.e. session notes, historical information, chart information ... and more) the greatest selling band in history. Where is the Marketing team at Capitol? Expectations were high after ""1"" and ""Anthology"". I agree, the folks at Capitol need to take a hint from Rhino (or simply hiring their Marketing team)."
3,poor packaging,the music of course is what i expected. but for the dollar that i paid for this you would have expected better packaging instead of paper sleeves basically.
5,You will love this box set,"The sound of this box set is as close as it gets to the original 1964 Beatles' U.S. albums. In my opinion, this is the best CD box set of the year. I hope the upcoming volume 2 will have the same standard. I can not wait for that."
1,the music and the fans deserve much better,"Having been primed by recent excellent remasters of a lot of old catalogue, from this period and even prior (think the excellent Sinatra Capitol '50s era remasters), many will race to buy this, perhaps most cherished, catalogue of my generation.They will be sadly disappointed if they expect to get the sonic improvements we have heard on the Stones remasters, the superior Hendrix, the revlatory Miles and even the uneven Dylan remasters.Neither the stereo or mono versions, show any great step forward in sonics, over the already available abysmal transfers to CD format. The cheesy outside cover speaks for itself in terms of the packaging. It also serves as a good clue to what can be expected inside. The included booklet is no prize either for that matter.If negative stars were an option, they would apply here. For a catalogue of work, as much a keystone of my generation as this is, this shabby treatment shoud not be forgiven, much less patronized."
3,When will they learn?,"Nice to finally have these songs with decent sound quality. I've skimmed through the albums and I definitely prefer the mono versions. The stereo versions all have tons of reverb and the instruments and vocals are hard panned to the sides. It's like listening from the top seat of an empty basketball arena, with the band on opposite ends of the building. This is not what really bothers me though. The packaging is what really bothers me.They put the discs in cardboard replicas of the the vinyl covers. THESE THINGS SCRATCH CDS!!!!!! My Pearl Jam - Vitalogy, No Code, Tragically Hip - Trouble at the Henhouse, Rurouni Kenshin box sets, all scratched like crazy because of the stupid cardboard cases. Now I buy slim cases and leave them in those instead. A couple of these discs even got scuffed when I took them out to put them in the slim cases. Please, I'm begging you, no more cardboard cases!"
4,"Great Place To Start, Long Time Fans Think Twice...","The sound here is fantastic, the packaging below average (hence only 4 stars);but, the music is beyond reproach. For anyone interested in starting a Beatles cd collection this is a great place to start.This is the best sounding version of these songs to date. Purists might disagree with the way these albums are compiled and may be better off looking to the individual UK releases.All and all an excellent set that will make a great gift for any Beatles fan regardless of her/his level of interest in the band."
2,EMI dropped the ball again!,"I will not buy this product simply because of the awful packaging. Just read any of the other reviews here and you will see why. Capitol Records should be ashamed of themselves. The Beatles were and still are their ""cash cows""....how could they do this to them? Disgraceful."
1,RIP-OFF!!!,"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? How many more configurations of same, same music is Capitol Records going to SCREW Beatles fans out of their money? HUH?!! Someone should grab the executives by their neckties and MAKE them remaster ALL of the original British catalogue with stereo and mono mixes ON THE SAME DISC!!!!!! Don't fall for THIS [...]! RESIST! Better yet, put pressure on them to release these in the SACD format and BE DONE WITH IT!"
3,No sera mucho?????,"Desde que me regalaron mi primer disco de The Beatles cuando solo tenia 4 años de eda marcaron mi vida, siempre he pensado que despues de ellos no hay nada nuevo, pero....esto....es demasiado, es decir, la totalidad de las canciones que contiene este Box las puedes encontrar en todos los discos ya en venta, ademas es engañoso ver que traen mas de 16 canciones pero...repetidas, vienen con el sonido en stereo y en mono, nada mas, nada nuevo, aparte de algunas fotografias el resto lo haces tu grabando un cd por el orden de cada disco.Es recomendable para fanaticos incondicionales(por algo lo compre) pero si estas empezando es una buena alternativa..para el resto ocupe el dinero en comprar los dvd de Ed Sullivan o el libro de la Antología."
1,MINUS ZERO,"Everyone knows (even a so called fan of these antique pillows) that their first five albums were THE WORST as they are from your greatgrandparents' time and smell of stale water, the cat's whiskers after gnawing on a dead rat and sweaty socks.You have to be one bit of a sentimentalist to adhere to such sensations.Excuse me, the truth is THE truth"
3,Now give this treatment to the British albums.,"Now that the early Capitol LPs got the stereo/mono treatment, how about doing that to the early British Parlophone LPs, ""Please Please Me"", ""With The Beatles"", ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Beatles For Sale"". All four, which were all released as stereo LPs, are on CD only in mono. The first two are one channel music, other channel vocals. The last two were recorded on four-track tape allowing for good stereo mixes. I've never forgiven Capitol Records for the butching of the British LPs which I heard in the 1980s to the point of getting the more recent Beatle CD compilations such as the Anthology volumes, ""1"" and ""Let It Be...Naked"" in Canada. I am not getting the Capitol Album sets even in Canada. I prefer hearing The Beatles the way they came out of the Abbey Road Studios."
2,Marketing - Money Issues....,"I Admire The Beatles, but can't they release SACD form? I mean, the music company who manufacture the CD must take into consideration the sound system before. Also, they had released several greatest hits - for me that is enough. Over exaggerating the artist's success...."
3,ANOTHER BEATLES COLLECTION,"Wow, I'm so surprised Capital recordshas released yet another Beatles collection.I own the original:""THE BEATLES, EP Collection""The original mono recordingsas it sounded when they firstappeared as the FAB FOUR.I wonder how Capital Records'added fake stereo improves or killsthe raw sound of the Beatles?Someone give me a clue"
2,what garbage,"i was brought up on listening to most of the early beatles ( british ) lp's on mono. why oh why would i listen to it now on stereo which isnt the original sound. i like the mono sound, its how they recorded it. apart from the fact that the american mixes are all butchered like somebody already said. dont buy it. go buy all the originsl cd's in the british recordings."
4,They shouldn't get away with it,"Although the music far outweighs the packaging in terms of importance, this release almost beggars belief in its shoddy presentation: Capitol/Apple need a reprimand for undermining this set's significance with REALLY bad packaging. The box, the sleeves, the booklet, EVERYTHING is cruddy. It's a small miracle the remastering is actually ok, regardless whether you prefer the stereo or mono mixes."
4,Tube sound and 24 bits!,"Yes, the packaging could have been better. From what I understand, there was a time problem and the notes by a respected Beatles expert were not included because of this.Otherwise, the CD's sound like the original American LP's and 45's. The tapes were not remixed, or altered, and Capital used vacuum tube (aka valve) equipment for authentic period sound. Don't go for expensive imports and audiophile vinyl (I have some Mobile Fidelity Beatle reissues) until you've heard these. Capital did a fine job in the sonics department, and their decisions were appropriate."
5,They're in true stereo & twin channel duophonic,"Those condemning the Capitol albums often claim that the company remixed the songs and issued everything in fake stereo. That is simply not true. Most songs appearing on the first four Capitol albums are true stereo mixes. The important thing to know is that The Capitol Albums, Vol. 1 marks the stereo debut on CD of 32 Beatles songs. Hearing stereo mixes of songs such as And I Love Her, If I Fell, Things We Said Today, No Reply and I'll Follow The Sun on CD will certainly be a treat."
4,The packaging complainers are NOT just being picky,"Love the CDs and there's plenty to read about them elsewhere, but the packaging is really as crappy as you've read--you either have to pry the outer box open with your fingers and yank or whack the back of it to get the inner package out. Once you do that, it's just the opposite. On one of my first two handlings, all the replica albums fell to the floor and two of the CDs fell out since there is no internal sleeve to hold them in place. If you want to store the long box away and just use the inner, it can be folded in two and placed in your CD rack, but as a flimsy piece of cardboard with no information printed on the end. For the money, we deserved more."
5,Beatles forever!,"I have been waiting for almost 20 years for stereo version of early The Beatles' tracks. Overall, I am very happy with this volume 1 box set. Two thumbs up for the sound technicians who did the remastering job splendidly."
3,Package designed by a blind person. Should be recalled!,How embarassing to have the most popular band ever be represented by a hideously badly designed package. Should be recalled!
3,Savate VHS,I come from a Savate background with French instructors and French champions. This is not one of my top videos on Savate but there is very little out on Savate so it's worth adding to your library.
1,VIDEO CARD ISSUES,"I bought this game because i enjoyed the original version and was really excited to play this one.After installation i got a message saying my video card was too old for this game! It's a one year old DELL laptop with every bell and whistle. The card is ATI Mobile 7500. I updated video drivers, but it was a no go.I guess you need a top of the line PC bought in the past 3-6 months to play this. I'd say stay away unless you want a nasty surprise, especially since the game box has NO warning on it."
4,Zoo Tycoon 2,I loved the game. It was so much fun taking care of the animals. Taking pictures in Camera Mode was fun. The interactions the animal gave were so real. It isn't a surprise that it already won awards. The graphics also blown me away. Using unlimited budget in free form was also a great option. Zoo Guest Mode also gave a feeling of what a guest would feel when you're in the zoo. One disappointing thing was the lack of animals. This game is not too easy and not too hard. First download the Zoo Tycoon 2 trial at Microsoft. This is a great game for Zoo Tycoon fans.
3,not better just different,"We have Zoo Tycoon 1 and all the expansion packs. They run fine. This game is veeery sloooow at times. In some aspects they have made the game easier. The animals are far easier to please and you don't have to know much about them or their enviroment. Just hire a zoo keeper and you're set. The graphics that allow you to walk through the zoo as a guest are interesting but it is also frustrating to get where you want to go. Overall until the price comes down, the earlier version is a much better game for the money."
5,A Great Sequel to Zoo Tycoon,"Zoo Tycoon was great, but Zoo Tycoon2 is much more realistic. You can adopt 29 animals, 4 of which are different from what you get in Zoo Tycoon.You can assume the role of different people in your zoo; a zoo guest, a matinence worker, a zoo keeper, and the zoo owner.In this game, you can actually choose what you feed your animals. You can groom, wash, and heal your animals. You can also build waterfalls and moats.Another good thing is that in the freeform games, your cash is unlimited, so you can buy whatever you want. But in the campaign games, you don't get very much money, except for in the first one.One con is the system requirements. It was days before I could actually start playing the game becuse first we didn't have a 3-D graphics (video) card, then we didn't have enough memory, and we had just gotten a new computer a month ago."
5,One of the best games ever,"Zoo tycoon 2 is A great game! Graphics are awsome and the option of being able to feed and clean your animals is cool!I do like the Zoo tycoon Complete Collection better only because it has so many more animals including dinos and marine animals, but this game is still very fun! This game has far more pros then cons and is diffently worth the money!! I made a list of some pros and cons.Pros1. Its got great graphics2. Its really easy and quick to install3. Its not hard to learn how play4. It can be as challenging as you want it to be depending on the options you choose.Cons1. I wish it had more animalsThere is diffently more pros then cons! I'v played a lot of tycoon games (they are my favorit) and by far this is the best tycoon game ever I diffently recommend this game and if not this one try Zoo tycoon Complete collection that one is great too!!!"
3,"Good game, if you have the right computer","If you liked the first Zoo Tycoon, you will love this one. It lets you get really up close to your animals, and you can see your zoo from your guests' point of view.The graphics are cool too- the animals look really cool! The only problem is, it is really slow and it can mess up your computer. When I was playing the game, it was hard to build paths and cages because it was really slow. Then when I was done playing the game, it took my computer like 5 minutes to go back to normal. And my computer isn't even old! Its a windows XP and its only about a year old. So, unless you have like the best computer ever, this game is pretty slow. I might buy it."
1,BLAH!!!!!,I got this game on hopes that it would work.It did not work on any of my computers or the 3 other computers i tried it on!!! DONT BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL WASTE 40.00 JUST LIKE I DID DONT BUY IT OK?
5,Zoo Tycoon 2,"To start I'd just like to say I think this is going to be a great game. I can't wait until I can get it. It hasn't come to where I live yet (I live in Canada) but it should be here anytime now I'm sure! The graphics look certainly better than the first, but the best looking thing about this game is the fact you can get up close and personal with all your animals, (especially if you go into the new Zookeeper mode I'm hearing about). I think the photo mode is going to be cool too, because since you own the ""zoo"", you can actually go inside exhibits and take pics of the animals. The biome brush tool I read about on the website looks like it's going to make it a lot easier to make exhibits too. You can also mix animals in the same exhibit, without the lions chasing after those gazelles and eating them in one big cloud of dust like the original Zoo Tycoon. Overall this is going to be an excellent game. (I totally can't wait till Christmas now, so I can get my copy.)"
4,"Unknown in the US, but should be",Even has a unique and pleasant voice. I think that his work will only get better. Each track gets a little better after each listen.
3,work fairly well,"These fit my 3 & 6 year old's heads, but they shut off at certain angles. If I hand it back to my daughter, it shuts off. It may have been just a quirk with ours, but I sold the van a few weeks ago and I have no need to figure it out. They did turn themselves off after a perid of time which saved the batteries. And they were very comfortable for my daughters. It was almost like a short in the wiring that shut them off if you moved your head wrong. Very annoying for a 3 year old. She just took them off & watched the movie without sound."
5,Headphones,"Very nice product but did not meet my needs and was incompatible with my equipment, so I had to return for refund. Merchant promptly refunded purchase price upon return of the headset."
1,Not with Apex,"I took Michael's advice and bought this remote at a local store. I needed to replace a lost remote for my Apex DVD player (1100W). The back of the packaging lists Apex under DVD players. Got it home and it didn't work. Tried the ""Code Search"" feature with no success. I happened to have a second Apex DVD player (different model) so I tried the Apex code on that and it didn't work either. I'll be returning it."
2,Not Compatable,"I origionaly purchesed this item for three reasons: one, the price; two, the the looks, and three, the functions. To my dissmay when it arrived it didn't work for my Philips TV which I bought last year. I was surprised that it did work for all the other components though. My adivce to you about this remote is if you really want go to the store so you can see what componemts it is compatibale with."

2,"Old product, isn't worthy for 200","With my KEF iQ10, the quality of the sound is pretty good. I actually bought it for more than one year. Mine is not old, but the manufacturing design of the product is too old. High heat production, prolonged small noice, and intermittent big ""bump"" sound (I have no idea why it could make that sound) are the problems that I'm suffering. As my advice, if you are going to spend 200, you can even buy a new model with 5.1 or 7.1 channel."
3,Missing parts,"Amp did not come with power supply. The amp itself appears to be in good condition, but I am curious about functionality. Will update when I get power supply to see if it works."
4,Onkyo,"Hello, For the price a good value. My Onkyo M504 sound exactly the same. You'll notice a slight hum when the main is off. Turn the unit off manually or use an external switcher. The hum when the unit switched to stand by is something shared by all Onkyo amps in my experience. The Rca inputs are well served with high power inputs if you can bear to cut rca cords and are willing to run a risk of burning out the input IC for huge volume gains.UPDATE 8/20/11i now have four of these value built amps. Each run a set of speakers. It would be nice if i didn't need to step up to say the peavy amp for more power. The humm is a power supply noise albeit a very slight hum. Four stars for really lame power. For $176.00 i'll want double the power to keep me happy."
1,Clips Out - Doesn't Work,"Purchased this unit to drive multi room speaker set up. With all of the advertised wattage I assumed it would have no problem replacing my underpowered 40 watt Marantz amplifier. Unit worked for about 2 weeks, and like many others who have reviewed here, after about 30 days, clips out whenever the volume is increased or if I try to drive more than 2 speakers (the old marantz amp could drive 4 pairs of speakers no problem). This product is a rip off and I should have listened to the warnings of the others on this site that have said that the unit is cheap and unreliable. They were right.Also, I reached out to J&R; to tell them about this issue and ask for help - they were unresponsive. Don't buy this product."
5,AMP ONKYO,"Compre este artículo y funciona de maravilla.Lo que más me gustó es que tiene un control de ganancia por aparte, lo cual ayuda mucho."
3,ONKYO M-282 POWER AMPLIFIER,"I'VE OWNED THIS 2CHANNEL AMPLIFIER FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW. IT'S CLEAN. IT'S RELIABLE.IT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE IT HAS 100WATTS PER CHANNEL HOWEVER. MODERN DAY POWER AMPS SOUND ABSOLUTLYGUTLESS TO ME. THIS AMP REPLACED AN OLDER (1977)MARAMTZ 125WATTS X2 RECEIVER. 25WATTS PER CHANNELSHOULD BARELY BE PERCEPTABLE, ..IF AT ALL. ...WELL, ...THEY JUSY DON'T BUILD THEM LIKE THEY USED TO.MAYBE SOMETHING WOULD COME OF THIS AMPLIFIER, IF IT WAS AVAILABLE IN MONO. I'D BUY TWO. THIS AMPLIFIER IS PERFECT FOR LISTENING AT MODERATE VOLUME LEVELS WITH BOOKSHELF SPEAKERS."
4,Good Zone 2 amp,"I use this amp to power zone 2 along with the Onkyo TX8555 Receiver and a multi-speaker selector switch box.Both have great sound quality; the M-282 is a good compliment to the TX8555 receiver. Note that the M-282 is only an amplifier with limited ability to adjust audio signal intensity in-line, so I'd recommend using it along with a receiver that can adjust the base/treble/balance and control the volume of the audio signal. I'd recommend the M-282 to anyone looking for a mid-range low-cost zone 2 amplifier with plenty of power at 8 ohms."
4,a dependable power horse,Got this to replace the Pyle amp that died after a couple of days. I only use it to power two small speakers in the back yard as part of a remote system hooked up to an old HK receiver. It is clearly capable of much grander status but I couldn't found a cheaper one that I felt would last. In my experience the well-made Jap amps last twnty years plus and are usually bullet-proof to screw-ups in our power supply or speaker short outs.
5,This thing... THE POWER!!!,I have two CerwinVega XLS-28's both run at 6 Ohms and 200 watt peak. There is a little volume knob on back and its turned almost 1/4th the way up. It powers my beastly speakers no problem! A simple interface that you know you get your moneys worth out of! I highly recommend this for someone who is just looking for something simply with TONS of power!
4,Realized,"That my receiver already kicking 135 watts per channel. However, there is only 2 channel in my receiver this will give me an extra channel. I'll call it channel C."
1,Gadgit Geeks only apply,"For the average layman, this remote is hell to use. The manual is terrible, as is the software. Viewing in the dark is a pain since the backlight stays on for a very short time...and you are FORCED to look at the screen instead of feeling for a hard button. Do some research...you might prefer the MX-500 (Universal Remote). There are NO bad reviews anywhere for that unit. Took back the Pronto and ordered the MX-500 today."
1,Dirty with scratches,"The product came on time, but so dirty. It looks like it was stored for a long time. It was full of powder and with some scratches. I almost returned it."
4,Buggy good toy,"I bought this toy for a four-year old who loved the toob, the globe that turned on the top, and the insects inside. He took them all out and named each of them (two of each) and just loved moving them around. A success. This toy was was a great price including s/h with this vendor compared with a toy store nearby, but the shipping packaging of a manila envelope was shoddy. I thought the toob would've been damaged without wrap; by sheer luck it wasn't."
1,smells aweful!,"Normally, Safari toys are great. And these insect figurines look really good. But, these insects have a very strong chemical odor. My wife and I tried to wash them, but the smell will not come off. I am guessing that the smell comes from adhesives used to attach the wings on the winged insects. Something that smells this bad (it actually made me and my wife dizzy/nauseated) can't be good for young children."
2,Insects,These insects were ok. I wouldn't buy another set of these. The smaller ones looked cheap. The butterflies was the best quality of them all.
5,very creepy crawlies,"These bugs are fantstic! Bright colors, vivid details. They look just like I wanted them to. The toob is a little flimsy, as some have mentioned, but they probably won't be stored there long. The bugs are realistic and seem durable. I did notice a slight chemically smell, but most plastic/rubber toys have a little bit of this. I didn't find it overwhelming. I would definitely recommend!"
3,review of ATI All-In-Wonder card,"Haven't yet been able to use the item as I can't get the software to load.No reason to think anything wrong with the card, though."
1,be very careful,"I have a dell 600sc (a server machine). The ATI installprogram either (I tried about 4 diffrent version, on the CDand their web site)1) hung the machine hard (had to reset)2) complained I wasn't the administrator (I was)3) ran for a little bit and then terminated doing nothingI tried it in a gateway 6400 (another server machine) and itseems to work.All times I tried it with windows xp -- eventually I'll use linux but I like to try out boards with the ""vendor supplied""software -- ATI may be the exeception to that rule.On dells web site in the customer forums, I read about others who had the same problem..."
3,Logo Key Chain,"I ordered three of these Toyota Logo Keychains, and they arrived in two separate packages. The Keychains in the 2 pack did not have the Toyota logo attached. Both logos were floating around in the envelope. I used crazy glue to put them together. The other single pack arrived in one piece. So, I used one key chain, I do not know which, for a couple of weeks and then the logo fell off and got lost.The base item seems to be well made, but the method used to attach the logo is very poor."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this key chain thinking it would look great with my toyota camry key. Think again...The key chain was fine for the first month, and then it went downhill. First the Toyota logo on the front fell off (I don't know where, or I would have reattached it with glue). Then the part in the middle where the logo is affixed (it's round and it spins) came loose and fell off. Now all I have is a big silver ring next to my toyota key, which completely defeated the purpose of buying this product!"
1,Price,"Even if this dvd did the studying for me, I wouldn't buy it.The price is outrageous and to pay $129 for a 32 min tape is just down right ignorant.ARE YOU NUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Scholarly writing,"Perhaps the most intellectually driven L & H book, an analytical bio., if you will. Their personal and professional histories are in a 5-section format, covering early years, character development, film technique, development, film critique, bibliography.For the casual fan, this might not be the one; for the deep historian, it will be very satisfactory.In today's internet world of mass researchers, one might hope for more detail, however, on ""lost footage"", rare photos, concentration on the 1945 to 1956 period, when they remained a working team, but the show business establishment didn't seem to care. There are other, lighter books out there, which will bring an even bigger smile for the determined sleuth."
1,"Wallace, The Hero of Scotland",If this was written by James Paterson then he was having a very bad time. The story was disjointed and written in a form of English that was very difficult to understand. I kept waiting for James Paterson to begin the story but gave up
3,historically informative,a bit messy to follow with the ongoing commentary as the book is written but it didn't put me off reading it.
4,Is Snoop Trying To Keep People Interested?,"Could this track be Snoop trying to bring back the popularity the orginal did? This certainly is an example of Snoop's style and rapping power, with some killer verses and an incredible chorus. It all comes down to wether your a fan of this style of rap. If you like this track, then you could be limiting yourself to Snoop's latest stuff, such as ""Dead Man Walkin"" and ""Tha Last Meal"" instead all the old stuff. If your a Snoop fan, this is just going to add to your collection of Snoop records.Happy Rapping"
4,A Must Have Addition To Any Tang Soo Do Collection,"I enjoyed the Complete Tang Soo Do Manual by GM Ho Sik Pak very much, I thought the layout of the forms was very well done, I especially liked the intermediate photos to help see how the framing was done,and the interpretations for the applications of the forms was very nicely done as well, I can honestly recommend this book to anyone who practices Tang Soo Do"
3,Not really applicable to my class,"Very few of the cases in my text are listed in this E&E. I realize that it is not keyed to my text, but that makes it frustrating to utilize to supplement my material. At first, I thought I might have bought the wrong book. I hope that later in the semester it becomes more useful in explaining the concepts."
2,Not nearly as good as the other E&Es,"The quantity of typographical errors in this hornbook (and it is a second edition!) are sufficient to make me recommend that you don't purchase it. The errors are not just simple misspellings (though there are plenty of those), but the kind were the wrong word, or party name, is used in such a way as to destroy the value of a hypothetical and cause unnecessary confusion. I get the sense reading it that the authors hastily jotted this book on a plane ride and had one too many scotches on the way.To put it simply, when I found myself going to other sources to ""hornbook"" my hornbook, I knew it was time for a negative review. At $37, you shouldn't have to double check what is supposed to be your backup. Skip it until they clean up their act with a third edition."
4,I much prefer the taste. My husband has ...,"I much prefer the taste. My husband has always used Scope, and I've avoid using it as much as possible. This new Scope is much better, and I definitely prefer it. With regular Scope and some other products I've used, I hate the taste so much that I rinse my mouth out and lose the fresh feeling that the mouthwash gives. With new Scope, I don't have to do that. I would definitely recommend it -- especially to people who are not good at tolerating strong tastes in their mouthwash."
4,The new Scope was very pleasant and friendly ...,"The new Scope was very pleasant and friendly to the mouth. Loved the new """"cool"""" sensation it gave. Didn't burn my mouth like other mouthwashes I've tried, and the aftertaste was very fresh. I also liked the closing method for the cap -- easy for adults but tricky for a child who shouldn't be using it without adult supervision. I will definitely recommend and buy this product in the future."
2,I would not recommend this product to friends ...,"I would not recommend this product to friends and family. Although it works pretty well as a breath freshener, it doesn't provide protection against gingivitis and other gum diseases (like Listerine does)."
3,"I have never been a mouthwash person, but ...","I have never been a mouthwash person, but I did try this for a week. It had a strong mint flavor that could be considered refreshing by some, but was a bit too strong for me. My morning cup of coffee tasted terrible after using the Scope. I don't think I would use this product everyday, but I might use it occasionally."
4,I really liked the Scope Mouthwash. It left ...,"I really liked the Scope Mouthwash. It left a very refreshing, clean taste in my mouth. I also have the mouthwash from Tom's of Maine, which is supposed to be an all-natural mouthwash and I prefer the Scope mouthwash to Tom's. There's just something about it that left a clean, refreshing taste in my mouth. Definitely recommend it!"
4,I recommend Scope Smooth Mint mouthwash. It has ...,"I recommend Scope Smooth Mint mouthwash. It has a spearmint flavor to it. It isn't medicineal like many other mouthwashes. It doesn't have an overpowering flavor. I also like the fact it helps cover my husband's """"cigarette breath"""". Other brands we've tried haven't been able to. I highly recommended this mouthwash to anyone who wants a mouthwash with a light minty flavor that lasts."
4,I liked the new flavor of the mouthwash. ...,"I liked the new flavor of the mouthwash. It was a nice minty taste. The mouthwash was slightly strong and stung a little when using it. However, it seemed to keep my breath fresh for a long time. It also gave my night guard appliance a cool fresh taste after soaking it in a diluted sample of Scope. Overall I found this new flavor of Scope to be very effective at freshening breath, and a great new alternative flavor. I would recommend it!"
5,This product is different from other mouthwashes. I ...,"This product is different from other mouthwashes. I like it. The smell is different from other products of this kind, too. I love the name """"Smooth Mint."""""
1,No.,I don't even know what to say. This book was so inappropriate. As a devout Mormon I can say that this is simply unacceptable.
2,Pretty but not well made,"Unable to wear them after the 1st washing. Stretched out at the waist. Size is right, Elasticity is gone. Definitely would not recommend or buy again."
1,Gigantic,"The size 8 is huge, at least 6"" wider in the hips than the size 8 Olga I buy in stores. Do not trust the sizing!"
3,"Nice litter bag, but tissues a little hard to retrieve",This is a really nice litter bag. It is extremely sturdy but the tissues are a little hard to pull out unless you're sitting in the back seat.
3,The Enforcer: Spilotro,"I was looking for a good summary of mob connections between Las Vegas and other cities. The book does a pretty good job of summarizing Tony Spilotro's life and the activity of the Chicago and Milwaukee mobs in Las Vegas, but there is too much Bill Roemer in the book. It reads like a war story told over drinks in a tavern."
1,Exclamation points aplenty!,"This book is all about the author, Roemer. His writing style is completely in first-person and Spilotro is only brought up about every 3rd chapter. All he does is list the names of his FBI buddies, who all were ""the best FBI guys there ever were."" He also uses exclamation points very graciously. At one point in the book, he mentions how one person whispered something, and he ended the quote with an exclamation point. Wow. Roemer, you're an FBI agent, not a writer. Let me whisper something to you: ""You suck!"""
4,same as last year,"this game is basically the same as last year's game. I actually think that it is much easier to play against the computer this year. they did change the controls a little bit which is a plus, but im not sure if its worth buying unless you're a die hard college b-ball fan."
3,Less than I expected,"If you already have NBA 2K7 then there's no point of buying this game. Game play is basically the same, but with less skilled players. This is also a guards game. Very hard to get an efficient post game going. Even the best post players will shoot a jump shot from under the whole instead of dunking. The manual has some complicated instructions from doing a drop step, but this doesn't seem to work. The positive is that it's only $19.99. I guess it will hold me over until March Madness comes out."
3,"GOOD PRODUCT, POOR SERVICE","The product is good, no complaints yet. However I was extremely disappointed with the condition in which it was sent.Granted the post can be brutal, however this does not mean that the box should be battered beyond recognition and the printer itself, came with ABSOLUTELY no cables none for plugging it in or for attaching it to your computer. Additionally, NO instruction manaul was sent. The printer had several black smudges on the top and sides.For the money I paid, at least cables should have been included. Thank god I have at home, however this is by far the worst service I have encounted since being an Amazon member.Totally appalled."
3,"Well made, but not too comfortable to use","The Rada Cutlery Cooks Spoon is very well made. It is a substantial thickness of stainless steel with a unique matte finish that will not show scratches. It is sized right for use in cooking. It has a straight front edge that makes it useful for scraping across the bottom of a pot or pan. But ... it is stamped from one continuous piece of stainless steel and has somewhat sharp edges on the handle. The edges are not sharp enough to cut the hand, but are somewhat uncomfortable. A more rounded handle would be better."
2,"Disappointed, Made in USA","Must admit, I purchased this serving/cooking spoon specifically because it was made in USA. The quality of the spoon seemed ok, (I never used it for cooking), but the handle was so flat that it cuts into your hand when you grip it. The spoon it replaces was very old, but had a riveted handle similar to quality cutting knives. It was very comfortable; this replacement just did not measure up. As usual, Amazon/Vendor were great about the return/credit. Just wish this was a more useful product, being made in the USA."
2,Short Spoons!!!,"The design of this spoon is a good attempt to fill a need for scraping the bottom of a pot. The short length of the spoon handle defeats the purpose because anyone needing to stir a deep, full pot of food will burn his/her hand using this spoon.Does Amazon or anyone know where I could purchase a Richcraft, made in LA, USA, 13 1/4 inch stainless flat edged spoon? I have one and cannot find any for friends."
5,Return of the Mountain Man,I purchased this book for someone who isn't much of a reader. He loved the book from its first page and read the book through in no time. He is currently reading his way through the rest of the series.
3,Did not grab me like a CALEB CARR book..was ok,"This book was interesting, but it had WAY to much courtroom time!!! I want the nitty gritty not the courtroom drama.. The guy was a sicko, which was interesting to read... Glad I read, but don't think I would buy for a friend as a gift...I ripped a review out of a magazine in the doctor's office and ordered it immediately and after reading it, I was disappointed, which sucked because I was psyched to read after I saw the review!!!"
4,Good show,I received this product in prompt time. It installs easily and can be removed if you are going into rough areas like the timber. It is not as clear as glass but ok and it keeps the wind out of your face. Good buy.
3,ok product,"I am satisfied with this product. It worked as well as I had interned. The windshield is a little blurry, but nothing I cant deal with and I have had no problems. Thanks Amazon and seller."
3,You'll be looking through plastic,"Most of the reviews of this product for other UTVs comment on the price, for good reason, as the price is so much less expensive than a glass windshield. However, this product definitely is plastic/vinyl, which means there is no illusion of looking through glass. It is quite apparent that you're looking through not very smooth plastic. So, if you're out on your UTV to enjoy the scenery, this ""windshield"" will be detrimental. It is very easy to install and does block the wind."
1,Wild west...not,"Oh my. I don't know where to start. What good things can I say about this movie? Other then it was in focus, not very much. There were so many ""jump cuts"" (dialog, clothing and items that are out of time in a peirod movie)I was sure this western was supost to be set in the 1880's. Now I'm not a history expert, but I'm kinda sure they didn't have plasic poker chips in the 1880's. There are too many others to mentionThe plot was weaker then watered down drink in a cheap bar. The acting was...bad, very bad. This was not even a B movie. The only good thing I can say was it had some ok kung fu...but what white guys knew kung fu in the 1880's? Maybe this was just a tax right off for some studio head. Who ever green lighted this should be sent back to the mail room, or worst, producing day time soaps."
1,HORRIBLE JUST HORRIBLE,"I really felt an honest review of this movie was extremely important in order that poor innocent people not suffer the fate I endured watching this hideous movie. I sat down with an open mind, I mean I have seen some bad pornos,B movies,home videos but this one stunned me. As the movie progressed it kept getting worse and worse and just when I thought it couldnt possibly get any worse I was proven wrong. First of all the story line was totally confusing, the acting was bad....really bad, editing was bad, I even heard the director say ""cut"" in two scenes. After the movie all I kept thinking was how could this bad of a movie get produced. Please dont waste your time and money as I did and avoid this movie from the school of movie making hell."
1,Tragic,"A number of familiar, good actors with a horrible script.Good Points : Jeff Fahey steals the scenes he's in, cause it's the best acting in the movie (without trying hard, it seems).Bad Points : Busey is not at his best. The scene w Savannah Starr (Lano)*towel*, no frontal (disappointed). The oriental actors parts come right out of a ""D"" Western (not low grade ""B"" but ""D""isappointing D-Grade...Full of cliche's and not really worth buying, or renting really, IMHO.In all, should be considered a bad comedy rather than bad Western!"
4,Eastwood With A Blackbelt,"I have never liked the idea of karate in a cowboy movie, but this one did it just fine. The story was good. As usual, Garey Busey portrayed the antagonist as well as anyone can. Being a huge fan of Michael Worth, the karate was great, as ususal, but I do not think I have ever see him do a better job of acting. Busey and aoo of his antagonists almost dominated the movie as much as Worth's character. The reconcilliaton of the brothers at the end was great, and unexpected. This movie had a little touch of comedy which offset all the killing. I really enjoyed this movie. Andrianne Barbeau is as beautiful as ever. Would have liked to seen her ""one knock out punch"" more often.This movie combined karate and cowboy just great, but I never want to see Clint Eastwood turning fifty flips in the air , screaming at the top of his lung , just to throw a karate chop to the head that gets blocked by a 357 Magnum. Great movie. Would love to see something of a sequel."
3,Martial arts Shoot 'em up.,"Based on the reviews I've read about this film here on amazon and on other sites(imdb,etc.) I knew I'd either love or hate the film. If you're a fan of westerns or martial art movies then you'll appreciate how Ghost Rock tips it's hat to many of the old and new classics. But beware. This is a B-movie with C-list actors. If you can only watch A-list movies then stay away. Cheers! To Lions Gate for giving a fairly average movie a chance to find it's audience."
4,This is a true review.,"This movie, judged alongside all the movies in movie history, is terrible. The directing is nonexistant, the acting is wooden and hard to watch, and scenes lack any sort of cohesive flow. Also, the writing is beyond bad. Also, the movie has several onscreen mistakes e.g. A flag with 50 stars in a western, an A/C unit, guns with no recoil.However, this movie is so bad, it is funny to watch. Roll with laughter as you try and follow the unbelievable ""story."" Slap your knee when you see the karate-infused fights. Belly-laught when Busey shoots a bartender and then screams, ""FEELS GOOD TO KILL!"" Just watching Busey smile is a credit to the film. So, I would recommend this movie, because for $3.45, you won't find a better ""comedy."""
1,Wow,"I did not think a movie made this poorly could actually make it through production and be released. I picked up a copy because I witnessed a few sceenes being filmed in Old Tucson....I thought I would keep the DVD as a novelty. No way. Bad movie. Bad acting, camera work, cinematography, and especially bad writing. A few actors looked as though they could have done better with higher quality writing...I felt a bit sorry for them. Maybe good to view for a quick chuckle at low-quality movie making. Otherwise, avoid this flick."
5,This book captures the English countryside.,I went to England for the first time and loved the countryside! It is so vibrant. My own photographs have never turned out very well so I bought this book while I was there to capture the England that I fell in love with. It has a wide range of beautifully photographed cottages and gardens. I am online buying 2 more copies as gifts for friends.
2,Serious design flaw............,"We purchased this system in April of 2001 for our van. We loved having it and it really worked nicely. Nice picture and sound quality. After about 12 months it began to develop stress cracks behind the screen near the hinge area. It was under warranty and we sent it in for repair. They replaced the screen and it was reinstalled. Again at the 24 month mark it is developing stress cracks behind the hinge again. Its a matter of a few uses until it completely drops off again, held only by the cables inside. After calling the customer service center and discussing sending it in yet again to be replaced it occurred to us that this will probably happen again in 12 months. After asking the customer service rep we found out that they will not replace it if the defect shows itself again after the 3 yr warranty is up ( from original purchase date). This product has an obvious design(integrity) issue and it needs to be adressed."
3,The Alekhine Defense Playbook,"This book is a playbook based on the Alekhine's Defense. This means that if you play this opening (1.e4 Nf6) then it will give all White's moves, but will suggest only one line for Black. Not a recommendation for anyone buying the book because they play 1.e4 but is for Black to find a specific line to play against all White continuations and therefore only suited to anyone who wants to take up the Alekhine's Defense. Having said that, if that is what you want to do, then this book is definitely worth having!"
3,New try for writing opening books,It's a new approach to writing chess opening. But it cannot cover some new mail line.
4,Need to be a little wider,Can't dip in with a one cup measure for flour and sugar. All the other containers have been put to good use. Suppose I should have measured first.
3,Fair for 4-wheeling,"Bought this to provide power for a GPS on a 4-wheeler. Works OK on more level terrain, loses contact when the going gets rough. Needs to be less loose in the cigarette lighter to truly be useful on a 4-wheeler."
2,Not Very Durable,"This worked for a little while, but not long enough. The appliance end became loose and eventually quit delivering power to the GPS. It didn't hold up very well. I am not hard on my stuff. It's just a bad design I think."
5,Made for a computer,"If you buy this for your computer and you complain about the speakers being distorted, thats usually why 5.1 sound cards was invented. Buy one for 50$ at an entry price and use the 5.1 slots for full 5.1 sound without distortion. Don't worry about the bass being distorted, the software from the sound card will let u set the controls on your computer. Find the right setting for you and the speakers will work much better then it did with crappy intergrated sound cards."
3,Good..but a problem,The sound that comes out of these is fantastic...but for some reason...one of them now sounds tinny...I don't know if it is the amp or what.But you can still crank these up and they sound great...I just wish they all worked.
5,Avant garde masterpiece!,"In the past decade or so, the music world has seen two of its most unusual legends championed by the alternative side, only to be pushed back into obscurity by a string of cookie-cutter CDs. This is a beautiful return to form for Daniel and Jad, with help from an unknown newcomer named Chris Bultman. A noiser (mostly) accoustic album one could not ask for, from their strange-but-somehow-straightforward retooling of ""Ruby Tuesday"" to the brilliant clatter of ""Pancakes Flop"". Reportedly written and recorded during a stay in Daniel's parent's garage, SOMEWHAT HUMOROUS stands at ease alongside their IT'S SPOOKY as a collaboration to seek out and cherish."
3,What I expected,"I expected a campy, suspenceful sexploitation film, & that's what I got. Plenty of gratuitous sexuality, with a hot actress who actually keeps the story interesting by having more to sell than just her looks...she is a more multi-layered character than a lot of girls in films such as this. It was sexy, and the plot is chilling as it's something that happens a lot in this world--girls get in over their heads when they try to earn a living though sex work. It was fun to watch."
1,"Garbage, unfortunately.","Well, I fell for it again. I'm a huge fan of horror/exploitation/sleaze flicks, and this has none of that. We do see the ""Cam Girl"" do her thing for a little bit, but that's about it. I hate to bash independent filmmakers, but come on, this sucked.I could have made a better DVD menu with my eyes closed. They have some horrible emo music video tacked on the end of the film as well. I feel cheated."
1,Don't waste your money,"I wish I'd spent the extra $30 and gotten an upgraded brand/model. It barely chops the ice. And the spout gets clogged unless the ice has already begun to melt. And if you use bananas in the mix, it clogs it up completely beyond use."
5,My Ruin is just what music needed!,"Gotta love that Tarrie B. A fallen would-be rap queen turned into a loud angry rock goddess. As lead singer of My Ruin she's found her true voice. A Prayer Under Pressure... is My Ruin's best CD and worthy of repeated listening. Despite a past fight with the band Kittie, music reviewer taunting, and record label and band memeber changes I know My Ruin has a bright future and I wish them much luck. Give us more quality and entertainment like this CD and we'll be happy. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they'll tour around my area one day now."
1,10064 is not a Good Number for this Item,"I ordered this No.10064 for the controller and got a Mike/Headset combo from a different supplier,and not the controller I wanted. It also was nearly 6 week before a refund was made altough i returned the Item the next day.10064 Is not the correct no. for this controller."
4,summer reading,This is the perfect book for relaxing on the beach. The characters are easy to relate to and the plot is pretty good. The story follows the lives of two girls working as nannies for families high up on the social meter. great book
3,So So,"This must have been a ""quick"" money maker for Sharon Stone. The plot was good, but the overall story was BORING!!! I really do not have much to say about this film...other than, skip it, it will make you feel better if you do!!"
5,It works great!,"I haven't had any issues with this card. I have used it in my Nikon D40, Canon point and shoot and my Garmin GPS. None of these devices had issues with this product."
3,Great music REALLY shoddy package,"This bizarre compilation matches some interesting early Torme's work with few more recent performances (with Red Norvo!), some jazzy arrangements with 40's style pop,all that with next to none info on players and original occasions of recording...Interesting enough, young Torme sounds very much like young Sinatra (not only because of vintage recording technology); it is intriguing to find out how they developed in different directions.However, this is probably not the best Torme compilation to start from.Incidently, Peggy Lee co-stars on several songs."
3,"adequate, but not a keeper","I bought the 4x8x6 kennel for my bigger dog but it seemed a little flimsy. Any determined dog could get out of this. I decided to sell mine and used the money to buy a better quality gently-used (Preifert) kennel found on Craigslist and am much happier. This kennel is probably fine for small dogs, though."
5,Perfect for our needs,"The Lucky Dog 4 x 4 x 6 uptown enclosure was easy to assemble,a good price and makes the pefect enclosure in our garage for our 2 cats. No more cold winter mornings driving to work because our cars have been sitting outside while the cats were inside the garage. Our cats are comfortable and safe while we park or back out our automobiles."
3,Competent but Not Majestic,"I picked this up after hearing the excellent title track on the 'louder than the dragon 2' compilation and I must say the album is something of a disappointment. While musically the band is decent enough, the songs are not memorable and really don't do anything to distinguish themselves from the sea of current power metal offerings out there. LMP has a bad reputation for just churning out generic power metal albums, and 'silent company' seems to uphold that reputation. Again, it's not a bad album, but with almost 20 years of power metal under my belt, this album just isn't interesting"
5,I enjoyed it,I finished it in one sitting. I really enjoyed this flashback to the 70's that I remember. I'm rereading it now.
3,Go Diego Bike,My son enjoys this bike. It was easy to put together. The only problem was the pieces to put the training wheels on did not come with the bike.
2,"the price is good, but the part does fit",The price is good. But the part of the from wheel does fit. I don't not sure it is because of the damage from the shipping or because of the quality of the product. I have to use some power tools to fix it.
4,A Very Innovative Idea...,"I have to say the idea of marrying hip hop with classic opera was waaaay ahead of it's time when this album was first released. Most of the songs on this album were masterpieces which effectively showcased the talents of the featured artists. What I loved most about it was the fact that introduced a generation to a style of music they would never have been interested in ordinarily, myself included. I do recommend it highly to every serious hip hop/rap fan out there...you cant say you've heard every thing until you hear this!"
1,No Miracle,"I bought this product for my 15 year old son. The product website makes claims that I found not to be true. Fortunately, our pharmacy gave me a refund. Here are quotes from the Zanfel site -""Zanfel is effective at any point after contact with poison ivy and will provide relief regardless of how long you have suffered with the allergic reaction"" and the most ludicrous ""After completing the first treatment, you should be itch-free and, within 24 hours, 75-80% of the rash also should disappear. For most people, no more treatments are required."" No way does it or any other product make the rash disappear in 24 hours. Save yourself the 40 bucks."
5,Worked great for me,"I used this 3 days into poison ivy rash and it worked as advertised. The itching stopped within seconds, I didn't have to reapply and the rash started going away within 24 hours. I think this product is a miracle from heaven !"
1,Zanfel didn't work for us,"My daughter removed shrubs and got into a patch of poison ivy over the weekend. By Tuesday, she had oozing blisters all over. She used a whole tube of Zanfel over the course of a day and said that it only worked to relieve itching for a very short time between uses. There was no decrease in the rash at all. She's still extremely uncomfortable and we will not buy this product again."
5,PHENOMENAL!,"On the 1 year anniversary of my own brain injury, I wanted to salute the 1 and ONLY book that made sense to me on my journey! I'll Carry the Fork! is written easily, yet not condescendingly. It is written with compassion and humor. It is honest and insightful. Most importantly, it has given me the courage to know that I am not alone!I wanted to write to Kara and let her know immediately last summer how much her book meant to me. Instead, like a crazed rock star fan, I tracked her down at a conference. I met her, cried with her, laughed with her, hugged her, thanked her and have become great friends with her!Kara's book has supported not only myself, but my family as well. Thank you, Kara! You have written the one and only book one needs on their journey through traumatic brain injury!I, too, am carrying a fork......PROUDLY!"
3,Why is this book so costly?,"I haven't read this book yet but will be looking for it at my local library. I plan to purchase the book titled, Over My Head, which is much more affordable for me in my present income bracket.Having had my own TBI in 2000, I've had my own issues over the past 8 years, including a significant drop in incoming moneys. So, trying to afford $63 and more for a book about TBI is simply too much for me..From the reviews I've seen, it promises to be very helpful and inspirational and I look forward to reading it."
2,Index is incomplete,"Mr. Fitzgerald specifically stated that he didn't intend for this book to be a comprehensive reference manual. But you would think that the index would provide a decent cross-reference of topics. Try looking up xsl:value-of, or xsl:for-each. You won't find them no matter what topic you search under. Usually OReilly does a great job explaining technical topics, but as with most XSLT books I've read, the examples are trite and provide minimal insite. I have to say I'm disappointed."
1,Waste of Money,"Everthing you find in this book is available online. Examples are so simple(to be fair, the author did state he will use simple example in the book)that it doesn't really increase your understanding.Afterward I got Michael Kay's book on XSLT by WROK, it soo much better."
5,"Not the Most Interesting, But Definitely a Good Start","Based on it's cost, this book is definitely worth every penny. If you are interested in coding in XSLT, this is the only book you will probably need for a while. Of course, I'm assuming that you have a decent background in Java which supports XSLT translations. Once you've mastered the concepts in this text, you will be ready for one of the larger reference manuals. Of course, XSLT reference ( from wrox for example )are pretty much only necessary for those who are looking to become XSLT gurus. This book is very informative and helpful but a bit dull, but then again so are a lot of other O'Reilly titles. Then again, if you're looking for excitement, read a book on skydiving or something."
4,A good beginning book,"Hi,Recently I need to become a little more than a beginner for XSLT. The word of XSLT is very wide and can be seen as simple as a formatting tool or as deep and complicated as calling java object from your tranformation.If you are already an expert on XSLT this is not your book, but if you need a start that doesn't require that you already know the topic, this is a perfect book to start with.Max Pellizzaro.http://www.maxpellizzaro.com"
3,good and bad,"I found Learning XSLT confusing from a beginner's point of view. It's poorly indexed, and Fitzgerald often uses XSLT vocabulary in examples long before he explains what they are. For example the ""select"" attribute first appears on page 105 in an example describing the lang() function, without any explanation of what it is or how it should be used. It's not listed at all in the index except in relation to the ""for-each"" and ""sort"" elements. He has a nice list of string functions but not much explanation of what kinds of contexts they can be used in, and few examples. He doesn't really explain how ""match"" and ""select"" are used together, or how processing works hierarchically by jumping between xsl snippets. Like a lot of O'Reilly books it presumes a pretty sophisticated programming vocabulary (like what does ""normalize"" mean anyway?).Some sections are quite useful however, and the fact that there are lots of examples is very helpful."
2,"Poorly Organized, and a Useless Index","Granted that XSLT is a confusing topic, and granted that this is supposed to be an introduction rather than a reference, but this disappointing book does not make the subject any more approachable. The author skips all over the place, including coverage of peripherally related topics that would have been better in an appendix (e.g., code points?).The book is further flawed by an absolutely useless index. Many important terms do not appear in the index at all, and others reference a passing mention in the text rather than a useful discussion."
5,Great Little First Aid Kit,"I havent used it yet, as no one has been Injured :) But it has SOO much stuff in it. I like all the burn aid inside since I work with Fireworks, people get burned sometimes. I put this kit in my Travel box with all my Fire Gear. I plan for it to come to use, during a show at some point. Ill also be buying at least 3 more of these in the near future! One for the home, the truck/car, and one for my backpack. I highly recommend this kit to anyone looking for a decent kit that covers anything from cuts to burns and even alil more! It even comes with a decent First Aid book, for anything your not familiar with."
4,"Perfect for car, hiking, or outdoors","Last summer, I had a little accident when on an outing and didn't have a first aid kit for my backpack. I've had one at home for years, but realized I didn't have one for my vehicle or backpack. This kit is so compact, yet comprehensive, it's perfect to take long to the mountains, beach, park, etc. and doesn't take up much space. The piece of mind knowing it's in the bottom of your bag is worth way more than I paid for this kit."
4,Good value,This first aid kit was a great value. All the items inside seem to be of good quality. The case it comes in is mediocre but for this price you can't really complain. The improvements I would like to see for a 5 star rating is for the manufacturer to add a few more antibiotic ointment packets and possibly a better interior design of the case.
3,OK product,"This product is OK. Basically at 205 items and under $20, you going to get what you pay for.When I opened it, half of it popped out onto the floor. The contents are not secured in anyway internally. There is no contents list, so combined with the parts being all over the place, I can't tell if it has everything it's supposed to (For example, I'm sure there's a safety pin in there somewhere, I just can't find it).It has things like single use sunscreen and a single one-use tongue depressor which have spurious value in a first-aid kit. I would suggest looking at kits based on their contents and quality (both of contents and container), rather than the total item count.But for $20, it's good."
3,Good value for the price but not very organized,"Its really good value for the price but they need to work on the organization of the pockets. Everything seems to be crammed in the pockets. When an emergency occurs you don't have time to go through each and everything to see where is what. It should be, you see, you grab and you take. With this one, you see, you see again, you finally grab and take. But yeah lots of bandages and what not. I do like the soft cover though. Its florescent orange so its easy to spot. I am not regretting the purchase."
5,"great kit, can't complain","great complete kit for the money. no complaints and it's exactly what i wanted and expected.yes, the inside could be organized better but that's no big deal. it would most likely ""disorganize"" itself after having it in your backpack and moving around with it anyway"
4,Just what the doctor ordered.,"Just about everything you might need for a day hike or a overnight trip short of splints, which you can always make and wrap which you can improvise."
3,Some important things missing,"It is important to keep in mind that while it says 205-pieces, that counts each individual band-aid, swab, etc. This is okay, just keep it in mind. One item you might consider stuffing in there is an ace bandage, and a bit more tape. There are two rolls of adhesive tape, but there isn't much on the roll. It is a good starter kit, but it is worth going through it and deciding what you might want to add."
5,Good first aid kit.,This kit has a variety of items to use in case of an emergency. I bring it with me when riding my motorcyle.
3,"Pouch is cheap, but stuff inside is good","The first thing that struck me when I opened the kit was how bad the organization and pockets were on the inside. I decided to take out the cheap plastic pockets and replace them with ziplock bags, and as I was doing so, the nylon shell basically fell apart. Wasn't too much of a tragedy though, I just replaced it with a more durable nylon EMT pouch I bought from voodoo tactical. All the stuff on the inside was good, name brand stuff. The scissors and tweezers are especially useful and seem to be of good quality. There is actually so much stuff crammed in this package, that I don't usually take it all with me at once on a hike."
2,Poor quality band aids,The band aids in the kit have poor quality glue. They tend to fall off by themselves within a couple of hours.
3,more of the same but poor diagrams,I found this book to be ok but the diagrams for lighting set up are very poor- orinetation is not even correct and there is little to explain the finer details of the light positioning etc. Only some of the photos give a diagram/explanation of how lighting was achieved and even then its poor and difficult to replicate. Master lighting guide by christopher grey is a much better book in my opinion.
4,the same,"its a good one but it says the same like in others books, it talks about the nature of light, then of every type of photography you can make and the main characteristics of the light to get those.I would have like it to talk more about the light ratio in each picture captured."
4,Effective,This is a good product. I like this company better then rosetta Stone. I feel like I actually am learning the language. I think more people should use this product then others that are out there.
3,Confessions for the Armchair Theologian,"This book essentially just goes though Augustine's early life, following the outline in Augustine's Confessions. It uses the Confessions as an window to Augustine, assuming that readers would start with that book and graduate to others---not a bad idea.It does really help make the Confessions even more accessible to readers unfamiliar with Augustine or his work.The only downside is because this book focuses so heavily on his life as described in Confessions it fails to really wrestle with any of the issues that Augustine was so influential on later in his life (for example, the problem of grace and free will).I'd like to give the book four stars, but am unable to change my star rating."
2,Hmm...,"I may have acually considered buying this, since I dont own any of the movies on bluray....until I saw the price. Holy Mary Mother of Christ, are you kidding me? No justification for that price for basically all the stuff thats already been released in a cool box. I'll pass unless the price drops dramatically."
1,What a disappointment,"I'm glad I went ahead and got the other bluray set. I see nothing worth 350 bucks here. It's just padded with cap and nothing really new. If you want the set, just spend the 80 on the one everyone told you not to buy. Big money and time saver."
1,RRRRIDICULOS!!!!!!,"The fans of this series all deserve much much better. Let's push the reset button on this one, shall we?"
1,"No new extended editions? Reserving final judgement, but...","... my wife and I have been waiting for the extended versions of all 8 films to be released in one collection. To date, the extended versions of only two films are promised in this product. Unless that changes, I see no need to order this set."
1,WTH!!!!,"As the title of my review indicates WHAT THE HELL!!! I love, love, LOOOOOOOVVVVVEEEE HARRY POTTER. I have not bought any of the movies because I knew there was going to be the ultimate edition to come at the end of the series. I am very disappointed on that this ultimate edition is basically going to cost me a mortgage payment for only basic materials. What is so special about five hours of never before seen content??? Lord of the Rings three movie set has over twenty hours of special content on top of the special feature's content when their ultimate edition first came out. I am very disappointed in WB and their money grubbing ways. Because we all know that there will be special editions to come when this series meets 10, 15, 25 year anniversaries and so on. This is a sad day in Potter Land.... :("
1,Sweet deal if you have nothing else to spend $350 dollars on,"Sort of ridiculous to pay $43.75 for each movie that you can buy at a fraction of the cost for just a couple extras. I was holding out on buying the complete bluray collection just because I heard this was coming out, but ya SCREW THAT. I'll just go buy the Blu Ray collection for $60 for like $7.50 a film. HA"
1,Please don't do this WB,"There is still time WB, take a look at all the angry comments here. Go back to the drawing board and give us an ultimate edition worth spending $300 on, because this is not it."
1,Don't Buy!,No extended editions means that I won't buy this. The extended editions will most likely be released at a later date and they will try to milk you for even MORE money. I can wait for the product this should have been.
2,They must think teachers don't LOVE HP,"Absolutely overpriced! When DH part 2 came out, I went and bought all of the other movies on Blu-Ray and they were each about $10!!!! I've been waiting and waiting for this huge collection to come out because I'd LOVE all of the behind the scene material but I just can't pay $350 for me to have 3 copies of each movie! Maybe they'll have a contest where we can write an essay to win one for free! LOL because otherwise I'm out of the running."
3,Expensive and Where are the Extended Cut's for all of the DVD's,"At first I was very excited to see this but now I am disappointed. Where are the Extended Cuts for ""ALL"" of the DVD's??? I thought with this collection they would finally put all of the movies out with Extended Cuts. Very upset. Then the Price is very expensive. How do they think can afford this?? I will have to save most of the year for it. This is Crazy. People don't have this kind of money, especially with the way the economy is right now. I hope Warner Bros thinks about the price and adding the extended cuts before this comes out."
1,Occupy Warner Brothers for this Ridiculous Price!!!,"When products are being reviewed, price should always be taken into account to a certain extent. Although this set is pretty cool for HP fans, the cost of $350 is not justified for the middle class HP fan. Why aren't the extended versions included? Because when the hype dies down for this set, they are going to release another one with the extended editions, plus who knows what else....maybe a wand, a cape, butter beer mix? Hopefully these 1 star reviews will get the attention of the movie studio to lower the price sooner rather than later. To the people who can afford this set and think it's worth it, congratulations on being able to purchase it, myself and the rest of the middle class are jealous."
1,Ummm.... no,"Wow! Look at all that amazing fluff wrapped around the same products that have been available for a MUCH lower price for quite a while. Let us look at the finer points of the package:UltraViolet-completely worthless unless you enjoy having yet another online account and wasting bandwidth.Blu-Ray AND DVD's-You can already buy these combo packs, and for about $14-20 each. 9 movies x $20 each = $180. Nope, the pretty box isn't worth the rest of that mark-up.That seems to be about it. No bonus materials other than taking the same clips we have seen before and making them into new features. *Yawn* I didn't buy into that for Star Wars, and I am not about to buy into it for Potter.Someone tell WB that unless you have something interesting to sell, keep your horible marketing ideas in the meeting room and not on the shelf."
1,Way too expensive!,How can they charge so much I understand that its a big package but seriously who can just blow that much money! Im a huge!!!! harry potter fan but this is ridiculous !
1,OVERPRICED,"I can't understand how Warner Bros can justify asking us to pay this much for movies that we all already have. Yes, all real Harry Potter Fans want this, but is 350-500 a fair price? I think we all know the answer to this. How do you people sleep at night!? Sure, this is the last hurrah for the HP cashcow that it has been, but really? I literally felt violated when I saw the price tag. I hope that fans ban together and not buy or pre-order this set until they set a fair price. I know I'm not going to take a loan out to buy this.No other franchise in history could ask for more loyal fans, and this is how they repay us?"
1,"Thanks a lot, WB...","I've payed $250 for the Blu-ray Ultimate Editions over the past 3 years, and now Warner Brothers decides to not come out with Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 & 2 with the Ultimate Editions, but this stupid ""Wizard's Collection"" which is simply a box set of the Ultimate Editions. $500 for the whole set is ridiculous, so thank God it's only $350 with pre-order. But the only way I would even pay that is if Warner Brothers will take back the 6 Ultimate Editions I already own and knock off $300 from the $350 price (which would amount to the retail value of all 6 Ultimate Editions). I would gladly trade in my 1-6 Ultimate Editions to get this for $50. I think we loyal fans deserve at least that, and not the company taking a massive dump on us."
1,Too expensive,"Warner Brothers, you did a limited-time release of the 8th film, promising something wonderful for fans. Then you come out with all the hype about this set, priced at $500, at a ""deal"" on Amazon for $350.00 I'm sorry, but no DVD set is worth that much money. They're wonderful films, and I was really looking forward to all the Ultimate Editions coming out so I could collect them, but this is just plain greedy.Many of your fans are teenagers and young adults who have grown up with the series, why are you making this so inaccessible?"
1,WB loves the people who are throwing their money away!,I fully enjoy reading comments from people sticking up for WB's. They are being made fools by a greedy corporation that has made billions off a product and show no loyalty to their fans.
1,"No Extended Editions, No Thanks.","When will Warner Brothers get it? For years companies got away with selling movie sets knowing customers would come back and buy the set again when they released the extended versions. Well not anymore, thanks to the internet customer ignorance isn't as prevalent. So instead of admitting they had a good run at it and just giving the customers what they want, they continue with this scheme of trying to get every last nickel out of the public they can. So I'll vote with my dollars by NOT BUYING this second rate ""set""."
1,Ultra-Violet-- No Way,"As long as WB insists on Ultra-violet digital copies, there's no way I would buy this set. I want a digital copy I can actually watch without having to stream or sign up for another service."
1,DVD's don't work and there's no replacement,"I have to say I'm really disappointed. We've only looked two of the years so far, and already 2 of the 8 disks don't work. You can actually see where the coating on the DVD wasn't applied evenly so it's no wonder the DVD won't play. I've tried the faulty DVD's in several different players, including 2 different Blu-Ray, and they just ""chug"".Unfortunately, short of returning the entire collection, there's no recourse. There's no way to talk to real human at Amazon, and even if I did, Amazon can't get replacement for just the faulty ones. There's no information on the manufacturer or a way to contact them. So we're SOL.Very, very disappointing. Not up to JK's quality standards."
2,Cheaper from UK,"The reviews are definitely not for this wizard edition as they are dated and this product is going to be released only on Sept 2012. Anyway, the price in US is so much more compared to the UK and they are Region free (for the blurays but DVDs are still region 2). Don't forget that you do not pay VAT outside of EU."
1,Ultraviolet = ultra NO,"I might consider buying this if the digital download was a true download. I refuse to buy this as long as the only option for download is ultraviolet. I plan on telling all my friends, acquaintances and strangers on the street to not buy this."
2,This price makes me cringe,"Sure some of the movies were good, but $350 good? I think not. Not even special features and and whole extra, never-before-seen-alternate-series(that's 8 alternate movies) of this would make it worth the money."
4,Some discs scratched,"The box is fun to go through, and really packed with extras. The actual design of the box is really pretty awesome, and finding all the trinkets and stuff is quite the experience. After reading about some people experiencing scratched discs, I went through and checked as well, and found about 4 of the DVD discs were scratched. I doubt that it would've happened in shipping, as I just don't see how that could happen. Personally, I think these sets were put together by hand, and the DVD's were stacked on each other prior to being put in their place. While the item is brand new, and seeing scratched discs is pretty disappointing, it's not something that can't be fixed if I really wanted to, and having a blu-ray player, those are the discs I will be watching. TL;DR, it's sad to see scratches on a new item (hence the missing star), but, for me, not a deal breaker."
3,Harry Potters wizards chest,"Extras are disappointing and set is overall very expensive. Otherwise great quality. I guess when you are a huge harry potter fan, it's worth it!"
1,ARE THEY NUTS - OR JUST GREEDY?,"I am so sick of corporate greed in general but this takes the cake! I love the Harry Potter books and all of the movies up until Book 7 (movies: part 1 and 2). I was outraged that the movie industry would take advantage of the HP fans by breaking up that last book into 2 parts - TOTAL GREED - and thereby creating 2 substandard movies. They knew everyone would still flock to see both movies so in effect we the fans were in between the proverbial ""rock and a hard place"". And now they come out with this absurd product. Who in their right mind would pay $350 for 8 movies (which should have been 7 movies) - that's $50 per book!?! Do they think we're stupid? I for one am boycotting this outrageous behavior - I hope you'll join me!"
1,Too High!,"I was happy to see that this was coming out then I found out the price! You have got to be joking me! I wouldn't pay half that. I imagine that the thinking here is ""get the suckers to overpay way too much and then drop the price gradually"" -- fine -- you won't get my money until it's $125 or lower."
2,Price gouging,"Yeah, I love Harry Potter since I'm a huge film fan. What an amazing series of films. I think this box design looks very cool, but the price is just WAY out there! Not worth $350. I don't care if they are numbered. Nothing really different except for a nice box."
1,Give me all the extended versions instead,"All I really want is extended versions of each films. Not a few deleted scenes tacked on to the end, but put all the cut scenes back in the movies and show me a 3-hour version of each. Maybe then they'll seem less jumpy and more complete.I don't even need a fancy wizard box."
5,THIS IS AWESOME!!,"My wife wanted this for Christmas and I was reluctant to purchase it for 3 reasons...1. We already had each movie on DVD and Blu-ray 2. The cost and 3. The reviews on here!! But after closely reading the review dates I saw that most of the negative reviews were dated before it even released! So, I decided to purchase it wife's happiness trumps cost! This was the right thing to do because it is pretty damn cool. The extended versions were worth every cent!!"
1,"Nothing ""Ultra"" or ""Copy"" about ultraviolet digital copy","It is digital, however! As soon as I saw Ultra... I knew I would never give $3.49 for this collection. I have dvd & blu-ray copies of all the movies & would consider getting this because I love the Potter dynasty. Then realizing there are essentially no extended versions besides the initial movies cut the $3.49 I already wouldn't pay down to ""I wouldn't even take it if it was free."" Ripoff in the most fundamental meaning on the word. WB was already on the proverbial marketing Titanic for not providing iTunes compatible digital copies of their DC Animation series & now they attempt to jump to safety on the Hindenburg..."
1,I'll Pass! Another Capitalist Adventure with nothing real to offer...,Nice pretty box! $350? Yeah right.Nothing new here folks just the same old rubbish for the 5% to get even richer off the other 95%.Let us know when you are ready to give the people something for their money and I am sure they will buy.Fans are everything and without them you are nothing.Lack of money does not equate to lack of IQ.
3,Are ALL Extended versions???,"I just want to know, very simply, does this set include Extended Versions of EACH movie???? The only place I've seen extended versions is on ABCFamily network."
1,"Ok, really?!","I think its funny as hell that Warner Bros. released all of the movies in stores, let them sit till the end of 2011, stopped releasing the movies, and then are expecting fans this p.o.s. beyond-overpriced collection. That thing has to worth at least $50 at most. If ur behind on the collection and looking to get the movies back dvd or blu-ray, go a store or ur pawn store, and they probably will have em all. Save urselves a lot of money, and a LOT of pain. Shame on u, warner bros!!!!"
1,OMG! how about no.,"I'am a MASSIVE Harry Potter but this is taking the p**s i mean come on? that price is way to much, especially for fans who don't have that sort of money. First the vault now this nice way to treat your fans WB, and all your getting out of this MASSIVE price is ultra violet - which is rubbish and 5hrs off new stuff, don't wait your money potter fans!."
1,$349.96 Are you kidding me?,This is a total ripoff. You are going to charge $349.96 for an over packaged box set that is full of everything people don't want? Save your money. What a waste. If I could give this set 0 stars I would.
1,VERY DISAPOINTING!,"I was so looking foward to this coming out this year. You way missed the mark on the pricing, no way can I justify buying this, no matter how much i love harry potter. I don't even want to give it the one star!"
1,Bait and switch,"I love the HP movies - and, in fact, own the ""Ultimate Edition"" Blu-rays of movies 1-6. I was really looking forward to getting the Ultimate Editions of the last two movies - only to find out that they are only available as part of this 8 movie set. And the featurettes, ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" (parts 1-6 of which are in the editions I own)are only available on those Ultimate Editions that are part of this 8 movie set. So, in other words, if I want to complete my set, I am out of luck. I guess Warner Bros. wants me to just forget about all the money I spent on the first 6 Ultimate Editions and spend another $400 to $500 on this new ""set."" Well, this fan is not biting. This decision of Warner Brothers speaks to me of a company totally out of touch with the market. I think we should all refuse to buy this set and ask Warner Brothers to fulfill their implicit promise and release the final 2 movies in the separate Ultimate Editions that we all expected - and deserve."
1,"Some nice extras, but another incomplete release!","So ultimate it doesn't include extended versions of all the films! Hogwash, bullarts, no way! And the price is ludicrous!"
1,"Resounding chorus of ""NO, YOU GITS!""","Dear WB, I love HP. I went to the park. I have seen all the movies. I haven't bought them because I was waiting for a collection somewhat like this one. Here's why I won't buy it.1. Price. No matter how much I love HP, I will not spend 350 dollars on the movies.2. 31 discs. Who are you trying to fool? I don't need each movie twice. I just need them on blu ray. If people still buy DVD then you should sell a separate set for it.3. Ultra violet. I have no interest in Ultra Violet. Give me a real digital copy.4. No extended cuts of the last movies. What are you waiting for? You won't get my money until I feel I'm getting my money's worth.So until then, I will just re-read my books. I'm in no hurry to own them or give you my money. When you do right by the fans, the fans will happily buy your product. Everyone knows this is just greedy cash grab. BTW, the collector's edition in France is so much prettier. I'd rather have that one."
1,Ultraviolet? Good luck selling this stinker set...,"As many others have pointed out...this set does NOT include the extended cuts of most of the movies, and ultraviolet? Not thanks. It's pretty tough to have an internet connection for my kids in the backseat of the car so they can watch the ultraviolet editions...gimme a break. You can't watch them on a plane either. Ultraviolet is a joke."
1,Faulty product.,"I should have read the reviews before I ordered this. First the box came in awful shape. And there were cd's missing from three of the films. I know this isn't Amazon's fault, but still...I looked at what this collection has and definitely, you should get the 11 discs version of the movies. Much cheaper and has the same special features without the bunch of booklets and stuff, which you are gonna watch once, and never see again (they are totally useless).The box is very pretty though..."
1,Just go buy the books!,Save money and get more Harry Potter by reading the books. The movies will never compare to the books and this set is ridiculous. I would never pay that much for a boxed set that has 31 discs when I'm only going to use about 10 of them. What a waste. Loose the wasted discs and drop to below $200 and we have a winner.
1,Ulitmate Editions for Deathly Hallows pt 1 and 2!!!!!!,"Warner Brothers is really irking me beyond belief right now. Do they really think everyone who has spent money already to collect the ultimate editions will just say ""Hey oh, well...guess it's time to drop another $350 to get my Deathly Hallows extras!"" I don't THINK so!!!!! I couldn't care less about most of the extra stuff it's claiming to have. They are money hungry jerks at this point. I want my Ultimate Editions collection to be finished, and I will refuse to buy anything else they try to shove at me until they release them."
1,BEWARE!! TOTAL RIP-OFFS!!,"No extended versions for this Blu Ray Box set.We care less for the huge documentation.The customers are Kings and we'll not buying it.We already had the same problem with The Lord Of The Ring Blu Ray until they were forced to releasethe extended edition.We'll do the same with Harry Potter.Please everybody, stay strong, don't buy it and wait for the full extended versions."
2,"Huge fan, but...","I don't think I'll be buying this. It's way more than I'd like to spend, and I'm not really interested in the packaging and all the extra memorabilia it comes with (that will take up a lot of space!). I just don't collect things like that. I don't really need the ""digital copy"" either. I'm interested in all the extra feature DVDs and the movies themselves, but that's it. I would gladly pay around $200 for all that content minus the books and trading cards or whatever else it will come with."
2,"Great except for the ""Digital Disaster...""","I bought this for my wife as a birthday present. She is a die-hard fan and was very excited to receive the set. The fun extras like hidden compartments, maps and etc were fun for her and I. Well, until she attempted to access the digital version. If you are a Mac user then you might as well forget it. It isn't real. My wife spent hours and a few tears trying to get the digital version for her iPad and after several irritated emails to Flixster and Ultraviolet, she was still unsuccessful. She jokingly referred to them as ""The Companies That Will Not be Named"" due to her frustration.So if you are cool with just the DVD and BluRay versions and some other neat stuff, this is for you. If you truly want the digital versions, then send WB a nasty gram and tell them the rest of us that bought this set are waiting."
1,UltraViolet is a huge ripoff,"Do not buy this set. The Ultraviolet claim on any of Warner's sets is a crock. You have to BEG them via email to give you a code so that it will work through iTunes. Even then, they might - or they might not - provide you with one. So, then you're just screwed if you want to play this on your shiny new iPad, iPod or Apple TV. They didn't want to pay Apple the small fee any more, so they came up with their own system - which does not inherently play nice with the established system. Idiots.I will never purchase any disc claiming a ""digital copy"" that I can't use on whatever device I darn well please."
1,Injustice!!,"I have waited very patiently for an awesome box set of the HP series. But this is just bull$%#@! WB is just out to make a buck. Seriously, the 'Ultravoilet Copy' is like a cloud service. This IS NOT A COPY. And no extended versions of the last few movies. Sure there are some nice special features, but for me to shell out over $350 for a box set like this...I don't think so. Even the box that it comes in looks like my fiancee's sewing kit container!Come on WB, you can definitely do much better than this.I like most HP fans have all the regular DVD's already, so by bumping the disc count on this set is just ridiculous. I think all HP fans should unite and boycott this cheap and poor excuse of a 'Box Set' attempt by WB just to make more money. Trust me you have lost respect of a lot of hardcore HP fans like me and not to mention, you have gained nothing by putting out this crap.I hope you (WB) read all of our (true HP fans) displeasure on this soon to be release box set."
1,Yeah Right.,"I don't own this, I am a giant Harry Potter fan.That being said, this set is so ridiculously overpriced it's straight up an insult."
1,Don't Bother,Let me know when one of these has some commentary.Stop rehashing the same movies in different boxes. The fans deserve better!
1,Bad Warner Bros.!,"I've been waiting for this set so that I could get extended editions of the movies. $350?!? What a joke! For that price, that box ought to be solid mahoganyAt least now I know I can save my money and I won't be missing out on anything."
1,Slapping Harry Potter Fans in the Face,"No. Don't buy this. I was thinking about it. but since almost everything in the description is misleading, I said 'forget it'. All WB is trying to do is screw us out of our money. Only extended editions for movies 1 and 2, and we don't even get TRUE digital copies, but the stupid UltraViolet streaming versions they suckered us with for the last movie, and that expire after three years. How about you release a true collector's edition, with what us HP fans want, or just let out the Ultimate Editions for the final two films?WB, you should be very ashamed for trying to take advantage of the fans of a worldwide phenomenon. I hope you get stuck with every single one of these sets and maybe then you'll realize that we're not going to settle for your crap anymore."
1,"Is this all you got, WB?","Warner Bros.... This is ridiculous. Any real collection will include the extended versions of all 8 films. The digital copies will be true digital copies; the UltraViolet copies I have say that streaming rights will expire in a couple of years!?! What is up with that??? I do not care about ""specially produced memoribilia"". I want the extended version films. I want this to be something I don't already have."
2,Disappointed.,"I haven't purchased the movies through out because I knew I'd want the big collectors set. I really thought they were going to do right by us. I don't have a problem with the price. I was fully expecting this and that's exactly why I've been waiting. But Ultra Violet DC? Come on now. How bout an option between normal DC and Ultra Violet? *sigh* There are a couple other things, but that was the big bummer for me. With being willing to pay their price, I should be able to get what I want and expect (e.g. maybe a copy of ""The Philosopher's Stone"" and/or extended versions of all the movies)."
1,They're crazy,With so many people out of work - and I am one of them - there is no way people can afford $350 for a boxed set!!
1,Harry Potter Wizards Collection,"Well. I've been waiting for this because I had read that, after Deathly Hallows Part 2 came out, that the movies would all be released with all the deleted scenes added back into all the movies and the 3D version of D.H. Part 2 would be included as well. As I have seen by the overview by you here at Amazon, I know that I will NOT be buying it. All it is is the ""Ultimate"" versions repackaged and sold together. All the extra footage done for the Lord Of The Rings movies was what made the ""Ultimate Editions"" of them so great! I guess I will just have to wait until the movies are all shown on the ABC Family Channel to see them with all the deleted scenes added back in. It is a shame, because WB will lose money on this."
1,DON'T BUY THIS SET!,"EVERYONE KNOWS BY NOW THAT ULTRAVIOLET IS A SCAM AT BEST. POTTER FANS WANT ALL 8 EXTENDED EDITION MOVIES IN ONE BOX SET. WARNER BROS. WON'T PROVIDE IT THINKING WE'RE ALL SUCKERS. I'M NOT. DON'T YOU BE EITHER. DON'T BUY ANOTHER REHASHED,RETREAD COLLECTION. SOONER OR LATER THEY'LL GET THE MESSAGE. THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FOR THIS PRODUCT SPEAK LOUD & CLEAR. ARE YOU FINALLY LISTENING WARNER BROS.?"
1,Don't Do It!,PLEASE don't buy this!! At some point these companies have to learn a lesson about taking advantage of consumers. The only way that will happen is if we don't give them our money -- especially for things we've already bought!!
1,Stick together HP Fans!,"I, like most of these fine people, won't be purchasing this set. Maybe if you keep adding things (like the recently added Horcrux Locket) until its actually worth $500, I MIGHT consider it. If you included the extended cuts, stopped advertising ""digital copies"" that are a trick, and make it better than buying a cheap printed box you'd probably have a lot less angry people here. Perhaps you should start RESPECTING the fans that have already given you billions of dollars by seeing the movies and purchasing merchandise and multiple copies of the movies already. I'll stick with my Ultimate Editions, to which the 7th and 8th better be added soon, thanks!"
1,Hello Warner Bros.! Extended cuts of ALL 8 films please!,"The subject says it all. This collection will only be worthwhile if you take the time to produce the Extended versions of all 8 films. Get busy, and we will buy..."
1,Price Gouge Much????,"Seriously, this is just harsh to fans. Even at $199 (it would be alot but in the realm of not screwing your fans THAT hard). I would never buy this for that price. I think all 8 movies on BLURAY for $89 bucks is a good deal, this is just insulting. Hopefully no one buys this until they drop the price by 75%! Thanks! The films are good, but I'll save over $400 with my muggle edition!"
1,For Fanatics Only,"While many of us where anxiously awaiting WB finally announcing a box-set of all 8 films in extended editions (which I believe is still to come since WB had a photo on it's website of a red slip-case with all eight films in it coming soon) they dump this on us.I suppose for the collector, the fanatic, it seems ok, a fancy box, all the material ever released and then some, except, of course, 3,4,5,6,7 in extended versions, in a limited and numbered (should be signed too, at least the major characters and Rowling) but for anyone else, just an expensive dust-collector."
1,We may be muggles but we're not blind.,Seriously? I didn't buy the latest collection because I knew they would eventually be coming out with the complete bad a@@ box set that would actually include every possible footage from all movies. The box looks really cool and I give a star for that but only because you have to rate at least one star. I'm so disappointed they would try and trick us. So how much longer do I have to wait for the actual box set? All I will say about the price is....RIDDIKULUS!
1,Where are the Ultimate Editions of Deathly Hallows 1 & 2?,"What happened to the Ultimate Editions of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2? I have already invested over $200 buying the Blu-Ray U.E. versions of the first six movies, and I don't plan to spend hundreds of dollars to re-buy them in a tacky themed package with some cheep versions of memorabilia that I have already bought high quality versions of from The Noble Collection, just so I can own the last two HP movies with the features promised in the U.E.Save your money and instead write an email to Warner Home Video and tell them to finish releasing the Ultimate Editions of the movies before they try and sell us this odd looking box set that would look highly out of place in the middle of someones Blu-Ray collection. While they might not be perfect and not have the extended cuts of the movies, they at least look a whole lot nicer sitting on a shelf."
1,Ill keep waiting.,"For that price I expect more, more features and extras, it's really disappointing, I've been waiting for a while, I can keep waiting for something better."
1,OVERPRICED!,"This is overpriced for what you get, considering most of us already have it. They need to just release the Special editions for the 7th and 8th movie, like they did for the 1st-6th. This leaves alot of people with incomplete sets. Considering the only new thing we're truely getting is a box, this is way overpriced."
1,What about those of us who don't have blue-ray,"How come all the ""extras"" are only on blue-ray - what about the rest of us who have never bought into the ""blue-ray revolution""? I guess this will be one set I'll pass on. Not to mention that I agree with the other reviews - I was so looking forward to getting all the films with extended versions."
1,Looks impressive! But the price is RIDICULOUS!!!,Are they serious? No no no wait. ARE THEY SERIOUS???? Warner Bros actually think they can milk this whole thing out to the most ludicrous level possible?Do they think we are that stupid? Gotta admit that the whole set looks incredible and I would love to own it being a huge Potter maniac but come on. Thisis just impossible. WHO THE @#$% WOULD SPEND THAT MUCH OF MONEY TO BUY THAT??Unless you hate your money. Then go spend on this.A mother could buy a year worth of milk for her baby with that amount of money. (weird comparison I know but necessary)I really really want this boxset but COME ON!!!! That kinda price is just crazy.
1,Buyer Beware,Wizard collection is missing content!!!!!!Creating the world of harry potter part 7 and part 8.[...]TAKE A LOOK!!!Is still worth the money????
3,cardboard?,"The set does look really cool, and I would be willing to pay $350 depending on what it is made out of. If it's cardboard, absolutely NOT!"
1,WAY!!!!! Over Priced!!!,I would have to agree with most of the people here. Not much that is really new. Not worth the money.
1,Cruciatus Curse on WB,No ultra Violet. Inude iTunes version. Extended editions of all movies. Reasonable pricing. No wasteful packaging.To this Collection: Avada Kedavra
1,Don't Buy This - A much better and cheaper alternative,"Amazon will not let me post a direct link, but go to the Amazon UK site and search for Harry Potter - The Complete 8-Film Collection [Blu-ray] [2011][Region Free].. Over 600 reviews at 4 and a half stars. It is 1/7th the price of this set. Read the reviews. There is no ""glitz"" to the box, but I don't consider cardboard and pressed on paper glitz to drive the price up to what Warner Bros. feels is now a better price??? Think about anyone that actually paid $499... Hopefully since it hasn't shipped yet, they'll see their cost reduced.."
1,Not interested.,Though I am sure this box set is very beautiful and will make a great gift for someone who doesn't own many of the films already but for fans over the years much of the bonus content as already been released on previous DVD's. And it's dissapointing that extended editions of the later movies won't be released. Is that how a company rewards it's customers? By starting a massive DVD collection for the entire series and then not finish it? I'm sorry but I won't be spending any more of my money on HP DVDs.
1,Ultraviolet! Really?,"There are two big negatives with this ""deal"" for me. The first is that we should be getting extended or director's cuts of all the films. The bigger problem is the lie that is Ultraviolet. What a sham."
1,Missing Disc,"Any missing disc makes the set incomplete and incomplete is extremely unacceptable. It was missing the Creating the World of Harry Potter disc, for year 5, The Order of the Phoenix.Also could have got it $50 dollars cheaper at CostCo if I would have waited a month, plus saving shipping, but that is aside the point."
1,Not Worth the Price,"This boxed set is a rip-off and an attempt to milk the last money out of loyal HP fans. I already have the boxed sets for movies 1 through 6. I thought WB would put out a boxed set of DH 1 & 2 so I could complete my collection. There's no way I'm paying out this much money for movies I've already seen a dozen times each. Sorry, WB, count me out! Or I'll wait 'til Best Buy or Walmart lowers the price when this scam doesn't sell."
1,Bummed!,"I can't believe they have the gall to put an msrp of $500 on this and only include the extended versions of 2 films! Do they really think that whatever ""additional"" content they put in would make any of the franchises hard core fans (which, let's be honest- if you're reading this you probably are one) be willing to put up that kind of nut to essentially duplicate their collections in a fancy box? Come on! Seriously- we all have the theatrical versions on dvd/blu-ray, a good portion of us have the Ultimate editiions as well, and if this was the only way to get 7-1 and 7-2 in extended format I might be able to swallow buying it, but just to get the same movies I already have?? Really?? I encourage anyone reading this to voice your opinions- because I want people to know that this is an attempted hosing- and that they shouldn't fall for it!"
1,Overpriced,This is a 1 star because the price does not fit the product. There are barely any bonus features in the collection that are not already avaialable and if you just buy the movies through amazon or wait until they are on sale you can save yourself a lot of money. Just way too overpriced.
1,Wow!,"I was excited to see that this came out, all the bonus features and what they said was all included... Than I seen the price! $350 and that's on sale! I buy this and I don't get to eat for a good month and a half.. Seriously WB make a change your not even giving is everything we want or said you were going to include in this product! You make it sound excellent then it turns out to be rubbish. Not pleased at all and I am a big Harry potter fan.. For anyone that has watched the movies countless time this won't be anything new.... Disappointment!"
1,No digital copy? No thanks...,"How unfortunate that they are choosing to go with the Ultraviolet ""service."" Flip this to a true digital copy, or through iTunes, and I'd consider it. Add truly new content and I'd definitely buy it. Sometimes companies make it really hard for me to give them money..."
1,Splitting each movie on to 2 disks?!? AYFKM?!?,"Wow...the audacity is appaling. I bought the ""Complete 8 film set on Blu-Ray"" for $40 bucks months ago, and except for the useless ""special features"" and waste of packaging, I already have this. Really, is anyone stupid enough to buy this? God, I hope not."
1,Bummed,"What I was really looking forward to were all 8 discs having the directors cuts or theatrical release versions, accompanied by a book with some photos and memories cast and crew contributed over the years. That would have meant something and really made me buy this. I already have all that they are offering in this set, for the most part. So there's nothing making me want to get this. And, for the price and what you get, it's just way too much. I'd rather wait a few more years for the directors cut versions to be released (if hopefully ever), and just get those. You figure 8 movies at about $20 each is $160 for all the films, vs. what WB is charging for this. $160 is far more appealing. And, even if they did bring the price of this set down, I still wouldn't get it. It's not what I'm looking for as a fan."
4,Harry Potter,"I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, so I'm biased. This is an awesome set. I could care less about UltraViolet, it's absolutely useless, but the other extras are nice. I love the documentary, the bonus disc, the cloth map, and the necklace! Is it worth $350? Maybe not, depends on how big a fan you are. Didn't stop me from dropping the money."
1,WE WANT EXTENDED VERSIONS OF ALL MOVIES!!!!!,"This is nothing more than repackaged blu-rays and dvds. When will WB listen to the comsumers and put these movies out with the extended versions? Many have asked, including myself and it obviously fell on deaf ears. Very disappointed and won't waste my money on this."
3,ALright,"I found this box set pretty cool. My complains are that some of the discs wont play, and very pricey. I thought the set itself was beautifully executed and i love it."
2,Unfortunately they sent us the wrong box - for US region,The box itself was great and we would have loved to keep it.However even though the box was sold as an 'All Region' - it contained DVD's for the US only - and thus we couldn't see them.It actually said on the cardboard box - that is was to be sold only in the US - and we are from Europe....We have now returned the box - and are waiting for our refund.
1,Garbage,This is $350 and won't even be the last release. WHY IS THERE NO EXTENDED VERSIONS OF THE MOVIES WITH THE EXTRA SCENES APART FROM THE 1ST TWO? HOW LAZY ARE YOU WB?! A RELEASE OF THIS LOW QUALITY IS JUST INSULTING
1,An insult to our intellegence.,A blatant money grab by the studios. Time to put our money where our mouth is and stop buying all this crap. Its insulting to our intelligence and we should not reward this kinda lazy profiteering.
1,RIP OFF... Buy from amazon UK!!!,"I got all 8 blurays with special features, in one box set from amazon UK... for $44!!!!You just have to make sure your bluray player can play ""region free"" discs... Samsung's are usually pretty good about it.Takes a week to get to you but well worth saving 300 smacks for the wait.Here's the link:http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00543RC0Y/ref=pe_217191_31005151_dp_1"
1,Love the Harry Potter Series... But there is no way I would spend $349.99 for the box set!!,"I really love the Harry Potter Movie Series... But I wouldn't spend $349.99 for it!! I don't much care for extras, I would have preferred a a set with All Movie Extended!!! And only if it was a decent price..."
1,Rip-off.,The price is ridiculous; the fans already have the DVDs; it's a rip-off to anyone who bought the films before they were taken off the shelves. Don't buy it.
1,From an ultimate Harry Potter Fan!,"I love everything about Harry Potter! I guess you can call me a Harry Potter""geek"". I was really looking forward to this set. I was really dissapointed reading the discription and reviews. I might spend a couple of hundred but I certainly wouldn't spend $350.00!"
1,sounds lame,"The packaging looks fancy...but really...it sounds lame. The content for the movies seems inconsistent. Why only extended editions for the first 2 movies? I agree with others that they should release an edition with all extended versions. Not to mention, you can probably buy all of the discs in this box set for less than they are selling it for. You just get a fancy box for the hundreds of extra dollars it costs you. LAME. I mean i got all 8 films on blu-ray for $32 from amazon UK...its definitely not worth paying over 10x that amount for some dvd discs, 5 hours of extras, digital copies i will never use, and a cardboard box......numbered limited edition or not."
1,"I was excited, until I was informed :(","I was all excited about this box set until I noticed that this wasn't the COMPLETE Harry Potter Collection. All I want is a Harry Potter Box Set that has EVERYTHING, extended, bonus, digital, all the bells and whistles... majorly bummed that this is NOT the box set I've been waiting for :("
1,Expensive fake crap,Is the box it comes in real handmade wood? At that price there are alot of things i could buy. 350 for movies already out. And you wonder why so many ppl download movies. They dont have that kind of money. Even 150 is to much for this crap
1,Ridiculous!,"This is a huge letdown.I have not bought any of the Harry Potter movies because I was waiting for a really cool box set that contained everything. This box set, at first glance, looks really neat, and it is actually kind of cool, but it is way too expensive and I was really expecting better from them. I think it is pointless to have both the DVD versions and Blue Ray versions together in the same set. I just want one ultimate version of each movie that has everything I need with all of the extras, not three different discs of the same movie again and again. This is one of the reasons why this box set is so expensive and I don't want to be paying more for things I don't need or already have. The ultimate box sets released in other countries were a lot better than this.Right now, I am a truly disappointed Harry Potter fan...I just really hope this isn't going to be the last/only ultimate box set they release because they could do soooo much better!"
2,Gotta Milk It...,"I love Harry Potter...enough to spend money on the full set, provided that it is worth it. However, I will not spend money on this set because there is too much missing (i.e., extended cuts of ALL the films, etc...). I see this release as a way to milk as much money as possible from the success of the Harry Potter series. I will keep my eyes open for when a more comprehensive box set becomes available. I would imagine that will happen a few years down the road after Harry Potter fades from the limelight and most people's memories..."
3,Ultraviolet is a DIGITAL copy,"Are you guys kidding me? Everyone that is saying that UltraViolet is not a digital copy, the you probably didn't try it out. Once you sign into your account you can access your movie anywhere there is Internet but also there is a section for you to download the movie to your computer hence the digital copy. Check your FACTS first please."
2,$344.99??? 31discs?? there are only 8films...!,"The price is too high and the fact that it has more dvds detailing ""extras"" is total BS. WB aware of the times, and hard to come cash? buy the small box set with 8films TOTALLY WORTH IT....you get the same dvds/blue ray that comes in this fancy box...that truttly not worth paying $344.99 for the behind the scenes...NOT WORTH IT"
1,Harry Potter Wizards Collection US,Getting this item was a horrible experience. Though it clearly stated 'all regions' in the description we received a US coded copy which basically rendered it useless. Long story short: if you want it and you're not in the US then buy it from Amazon.uk.
1,really,"This isn't a review, this is just a criticism. The price is to high, we control the demand for a worth while product. If you cave in, you get strung along... and i for one am tired of just getting the piece instead of the whole apple. When I hear complete, that's what I want to pay for, till then I'm waiting."
2,scammed with ultraviolet,"Not happy with the fact , that I get an email after bought and delivered that the box set was incomplete as the audio was missing, and I HAD TO CONTACT WB to get new discs sent, why wont amazon replace them? If youre paying this much money for a gift at least have the decency to provide full copies.secondly, the ultraviolets are not available to anyone in australia! what a crock!Also having read above comments, if you need a live stream, dvds can be converted anyway to be able to be watched on Ipad/ipod but dont advertise false material!I love Harry potter movies but please at least be honest , all the other extras are great! but they blatently lied about the content and extra footage etc.Not a happy customer"
1,Too much money for very little,"For the heavy price there has to be something extra besides a different so-called 'collectors' numbered outside package - Warner Brothers is gouging the Harry Potter fans... which makes no sense at all. All I see if previous released materials - there should be a wand, a cape, special T-shirt, the Blu-Ray discs and never before seen footage - directors cuts and extended scenes and deleted scenes. It's wrong to ask us to pay for nothing and calling it a ""Wizards Collection"" and it doesn't reflect the type of series it should be."
1,i have not bought it.,but i've been waiting for a whole box set since i do not want to buy each individual movie. but as i read all these reviews i can tell its not really worth it. which makes me sad. i guess i'll just have to wait. plus the price for this is ridiculous.
1,Too Pricey,"I own all 8 films, the first Ultimate Edition, and the two disc special editions of 2 - 6 and 8. I just can't justify spending $350 for a set that won't provide me with such a small amount of new material. Ideally, WB should just release a set with just the special features that we haven't seen yet. But for now, that $350 is going towards college tuition."
1,REALLY!!!??!?!?,"No Extended versions of the last 6 films, no deal. As simple as that WB. Why is this so difficult?"
1,It would take an Imperio curse to make me buy this!,"You have GOT to be kidding me. $350 for the same footage I can watch for free on YouTube and the same movies I have already?! Warner Bros. is out of their gd minds if they think we care about a fancy little box enough to buy this. Go to the GoodWill, buy a $5 wood jewelry box, insert dvds you already have, put a Hogwarts logo sticker on it. Win."
1,Another Warners rip off.,I have bought several WB sets over the years i.e. Pro Football & other movie collections and was disappointed.I was really excited when I learned of this set coming out. But after scanning the reviews(which I do on any product) I agree with the the one star reviews. Please pass the word around the world & black list this set. Just Sayin.
1,Is there at least a Nimbus 2012 included?,"I stopped buying the HP movies when I got a Blu-ray player in eager anticipation of the final, all encompassing, everything included box set. Come to find out we will still be waiting. No new extended editions... that's really all the extra features I am truly interested in. The extra features are interesting to me once, but only once. This huge box has will not fit on my shelf, I don't need 8 DVD's (6 of which I already own), and for $350, it should AT LEAST include a working Nimbus 2012.... the bare bones 8 disc box set for $80 is looking better and better."
1,"Harry Potter fans - open your eyes, and don't let them get your money","Still pissed off that they haven't even finished releasing the ultimate editions (oh yeah, they were supposed to be the 'ultimate' cant get any better than this' dvd releases right?) and now they are trying to get us to buy films we already own, plus pay for the blu-ray discs when a lot of us won't even have blu-ray players so we can access a few cheap props thrown in and 4 extra hours of special features? The only way they could get me to buy this would be to throw a new book written by J.K Rowling in and even then I'd be pissed. It's just so they can sell the same product multiple times... Each to their own, but they're not getting my money."
3,"Well, Took Long Enough","While none of this is NEW, this is a box set of what was previously the ""Harry Potter Ultimate Editions,"" which I had personally already started buying because I wanted the documentary discs. I'm personally upset that WB wouldn't have the foresight to just release it like this instead of making me pay on the side of $40 a Blu-Ray, which didn't include the UltraViolet copy, or the DVD. So now, already half-way through buying the series, I find that they've decided to release a box set. Really freaking cool, WB.Maybe, instead of trying to milk Harry Potter fans for all that they're worth, you can save them money by doing one big release instead of a bunch of individuals.And of course, making it a goddamn reasonable price, instead of $300."
1,Waste of Money,"Thanks but no thanks. This is a huge waste of money from a greedy company. After all of the support from the fans, you'd think they would treat us a little better. There really isn't anything that new here. I have the blu-ray ultimate editions, this looks like a compiled version of those. It's the movies we're really after, so save yourself a few hundred dollars and buy more affordable versions."
1,Not going to purchase this.,"I already purchased the Ultimate Editions of the first 4 movies. (I have ALL of the blu-rays and the 3d ones as well.) The only thing ""Ultimate"" about the 3rd and 4th was the price. No extended version. No actor commentary. Sure they added the cards, etc. BFD. I wanted the extended releases and my fiance wanted the actors commentary. I am done. I am purchasing no more HP merchandise."
5,Perfect for the fan.,"People no matter how much you moan and groan it's not going to change. Here's a fun thing: if you don't like it and don't want it then MOVE THE FREAK ON. DON'T BASH THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE. And be honest with yourselves, if this set included everything that you are complaining about it would be well over $1000. So be happy with what your getting. If you don't like it and feel that the other set is a better buy for you then by all means go get that one but don't complain for things that just aren't going to happen.I personally can't wait to get this set, not only does it look cool but it also has tons of stuff in it. Pre-ordered mine and I can't wait."
2,meh...,"Honestly not all that excited for this after seeing it. Wish it included the extended edition of all the movies, with deleted scenes added in. Also, anyone besides me notice that the colors are all off in the inside of the top of the box? The Slytherin snake is blue, the Gryffindor lion is yellow, etc. It just does not look right to me. Actually highly disappointed in WB."
1,Not all 3D???,"I don't understand why this ""magnificent"" set doesn't contain ALL the movies in a 3D version. What a waste of money! There is already a blu-ray set out now, so this set should be better. It just contains the same versions but with a lot of junk. What a rip!"
1,Enough is enough,"If your even looking at this set, then chances are you already have all the movies. Stop buying stuff you already have that comes in a nice shiny package. WB needs to cut the crap and provide a set with everything they have. Every cut scene, extended scene, outtakes, auditions, special features, etc. Follow in The Lord of the Rings footsteps and give up everything."
1,I don't need DVDs.,Why would I want any DVD's in my set? Could have been less expensive if they left the DVD's out of a Blu Ray collection.
1,Such a waste,"I am a huge HP fan, and WB is spitting in all of the fans faces. I see no reason to buy this, there are no new deleted or extended scenes, no extended versions of the last 6 films (which going over all of the released deleted or extended scenes, 7 part 1, and part 2's could have easily been put back in for extended versions of the films), and all of the bonus content from the Ultimate Editions of 1-6 with nothing added it seems. I am clearly disappointed at not just the content but the OUTRAGEOUS price. Nice try WB but you won't be robbing me (or a lot of other fans) blind with this set."
1,What a rip off!,"No extended additions so not worth the money, it's as big a disappointment as the ultimate editions were (I didn't buy them for the same reason). I refuse to buy any Harry Potter DVD that does not have deleted scenes added into the movie. I so don't buy that nonsense that there wasn't enough material left on the cutting room floor to add scenes back into the movies. Until there is a Lord of the Ring's like book edition for Harry Potter I will not give my money to WB."
1,No extended editions/director's cuts?,"I just saw Half Blood prince on ABC Family in the extended edition, which I did not know existed until this point. Now, looking into all the various incarnations of HP in Blu-Ray turn up only 2 of the 8 in extended editions? Sorry WB, no more Galleons from me until you put out a boxed set with ALL EIGHT MOVIES in extended editions."
1,No Way WB,"What is WB thinking? Options are:1) Release a lame DVD/Bluray extremely over priced set that sure a few hardcore rich people will buyor2) Release an awesome DVD set and and Awesome Bluray set with the features we have always asked for and a decent price and millions of millions will buy it.It seems like simple math but no, apparently they can't add 2 plus 2."
1,Screw you warner,"We petition for complete extended editions, so you respond with a $500 set that repackages all the old features and the same damn cuts we own. Not buying, total rip-off. If you looks at the amound of discs, just know that about 18 of them were already released..... I own them. If you buy this your just encouraging Warner to ignore customer damand and steal our money."
2,Talk about overpriced!,Gotta say as a Harry Potter fan nothing excites me more than seeing a full box set for the series. But I gotta say that at $350.00 this is ridiculous. I could just buy the whole series on Blu-Ray for cheaper than that. Gotta agree with a few reviewers saying that WB is just being a bunch of money grubbers when it comes to this set. It disappoints me that I waited for months for this box set but now I'd rather just buy a different set of the movies. Way to go WB. Epic Fail
1,I agree with everyone else,This is basically just a rehash of what nearly everyone else has said. I just want my voice to be heard and WB to know that fans are not happy. This is a sucky set and I'm not buying it and I wouldn't even if I could afford it. Good day.
1,So many better options than this!,I purchases this set in November. http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005GTJEZC/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_detailsHas all 8 DVD and Blu Ray copies. And special features.It is also Limited Edition and Numbered.A LOT CHEAPER with the same material and looks nice also.Glad I got it instead!
1,Terrible collection,"Though I've been holding a clump of money for the long-awaited blu-ray collection for harry potter, this isn't it. To charge for blu-ray, dvd, and ultraviolet for 8 films, and to not have extended/unrated versions of ALL of them is really disappointing. I was really looking forward to disposing income toward the perfect collection, but looks like I'll have to wait a little longer."
1,Really????,"No way!!! If you read carefully you will see that they are just a greedy hungry company like every other company out there. WB is just trying to make more money on stuff we already have accress too and the sad thing is there will be people who don't read what they are buying thinking ""MORE HARRY POTTER????!!!!! YAY!!!!!!"". Please people don't be fooled!!! Read what your buying!!!!!!"
1,"Fabulous box design, but","...a bit on the pricey side for the actual content, particularly considering how it's an afterthought for people who have been following the books/movies and collecting them as they came out. Complaints are as described in numerous one-star reviews. If you're in it for the movies, buy them individually. If you're in it for the bits of paper, save yourself three-hundred bucks and grab this instead:Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey"
1,Don't fall for WB's Dark Magic!!!!,"This is a complete joke, over priced, crappy cardboard box with neat stickers attached to the sides and only two extended films. All the other films have extended cuts like all the others have been saying and yet im sure they are saving them for 5 years from when they try to pick our pockets again. Vote with your wallets and DON'T BUY!!!"
1,OUTRAGEOUS!!! - Shame on you Warner Bros.,"I agree with the other reviewers on this site this is a blatant rip-off!! With the economy as it is now and the price of older Blu-Ray releases going as low as $7.50 apiece and even new releases going for $20.00 or less this price is disgusting! Even at $30.00 each that only comes to $210.00 - What IS Warner thinking?! Rowling is already a multi-millionaire so she can't possibly need the residuals. They should package a Blu-Ray set with just Extended or Director's Cut versions of EACH FILM and LITTLE To NO-EXTRAS (No 'Behind-The-Scenes' /Games/ Digital Copies Etc.) at a reasonable price in GOOD (NOT FANCY) packaging.Harry Potter has been a wonderful phenomenon please, don't spoil it with naked greed."
1,Crazy price for what's already available,"Even at $100 I would not pick this up.The refusal of Warner to offer Fans the extended versions of the films just seems stupid at this point.Originally I thought only the first two films ever had any extended versions, but then last night I was watching Goblet of Fire on ABC Family and sure enough, extra scenes all over the place. So obviously all these films probably have extended versions somewhere. What did they do, sign an exclusive deal with ABC Family?!?If you've already picked up all the Blu Rays, PLEASE save your money. Don't waste it on this."
1,The Harry Potter Franchise is finally destroyed!,"This product is such a waste of money. If you already own the ultimate edition sets for Harry Potter 1 - 6 and the 2 disc special edition sets of the Deathly Hollows Pts. 1 & 2 (I already do) on DVD or Blu-Ray then you practically already own all of the material that is in this release. I for one will not be spending $350 for only 5 hours of new bonus features (give me a break). Actually, Warner Bros. should be held accountable for misleading the public over the fact that they said & advertised that they would be releasing the ultimate editions of all of the movies with extended cuts, but in reality they only released the first six films and only the first 2 had extended cuts. I do admit the packaging looks nice, but I am quite sure that it is cheaply made and is not worth the price tag they have stamped on it."
1,Ultra-Violet Digital Copy? How About No.,"My wife is drooling over this set. She loves the way that the packaging looks. However, I refuse to buy ANYTHING with Ultra-Violet attached to it. I don't want the studios profiting off this monumentally bad decision."
1,"Warner Brothers, stop punishing HP fans!","I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I am willing to spend good money on a seriously fantastic DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital set, as long as it's actually worthwhile. Meaning it's full of truly never-before-seen footage and extended versions. This set is just a re-packaged (and overly-packaged, IMHO) load of everything else that's already been released. And the price...AYFKM?! Cruel, greedy, lousy, money-mongering, ungrateful--this is what Warner Brothers has become towards HP fans. The ones who have seen its movies repeatedly at the theater and who have already bought all the other HP releases, as well as a ton of its other HP-related products. Thanks, but no thanks. Give us something we want and something we truly deserve, and then price it so that people can actually buy it without having to feel utterly gouged. As Ron would say, ""Bloody hell!"""
1,No way for what is being offered.......,Add it up at for what you get and it is not worth the money.I have seen all but the last one on tv and I own most of the rest.I did not pay near this much money and have the same MOVIES.I would order it at half this price as a gift for someone because thats what I paid for what I have in my (H.P.) collection.Like I said I have all but the last one thats out and it will be out soon for retail sale and I only paid about half this price for what I have and I have all blue ray movies...Not worth what they are trying to charge people.I think this is out of line price wise...You can order most of this from amazon and you want have near this much in it.You can look around online and find the rest like I did and save yourself alot of money and have the same movies...
1,THIS VERSION NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This version is worthless. If you want true digital copies I would look at the Canadian version or even the UK version which is region free :-). Both will play on US players plus I believe they are cheaper.
1,REALLY??,Horrible. Absolutely greed and corrupt. Too over-priced for an average product. Come up with something better to impress all the HP fans.
1,Disappointed,"When my wife and I first saw this product we thought it was THE collection to get, but looking at the details of what is included it turns out it's nothing special. We will NOT be purchasing it because of the following problems:- Does not contain the extended versions of most of the movies- Unfortunately it includes the ""UltraViolet"" Digital Copy rather than the normal digital copy most people are used to. (I've tried ""UltraViolet"" digital copies and don't like them).- Only includes 10 hours of new bonus material and 5 hours of never before seen content.- Better packaging, something like this http://www.amazon.fr/Int%C3%A9grale-Harry-Potter-Blu-ray-sp%C3%A9cifique/dp/B005EOU9LWWe will continue to wait for a true collection to be released - unfortunately this collection is just a weak attempt to get more money from Harry Potter fans."
1,A lot of extra nothing,"Why in the world would I pay $350 for this, when I can go pick up the complete set for $100 at Best But, Walmart or for $80 on Amazon? The only the extra with this set is the cost. I don't want watch the extra features to see the deleted/extended scenes. Just add them into the movie. I will pass on this and wait until they extend all the films."
2,Where are the extended versions,"I do not care about 3D or Blue Ray nearly as much as I do about the extended versions. The Chamber of Secrets is MUCH better with the added material! Most of the additions to movies 1 thru 5 add to the flow as well. I think I will wait for the extended versions rather than overpay for this ""collection""."
1,Was looking forward to this.....,But then I found out that they are not including the extended versions of the 8 films. If they do not do this what is the point? And don't get me started about the price...
1,LAME,"Don't be a sucker and buy this. Its a complete waste of money. When they release ALL the films with extended versions, ill buy it. But not this garbage."
1,Waste of money!,"This is complete waste of money, unless you don't own the films before buying this. They need to stop holding back on features just to make more money from the films, with every update."
1,Obscene Price for what is included!,The Wizards collection set is so overpriced it is insulting. Only a little bit of new material is in here. Warner just wants to exploit this and take advantage of fans yet once again. Just a horrible decision to make this set so expensive. Even if this set was half as much it would still be too overpriced.
1,"Extended editions, please","I have put off buying any Harry Potter films due to wanting the entire boxed set with the extended versions of the film. I'm sorry, but this boxed set does not deliver according to the details on here and from the Harry Potter website. In my opinion. This is absolutely unacceptable for the price. Warner Bros. you know what people want, and expecting people to buy this in the interim is just insulting."
1,Riddikulus,"While I think some of the extra items of this set such as the map of Hogwarts and the cloth map of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are absolutely fantastic as well as the bonus Creating the World of Harry Potter discs, I simply cannot even begin to imagine spending over $300 for what I essentially already have. Absolutely unbelievable the lengths they're going to to get people's money. There is certainly no way I will be spending any of my money on this."
4,Can't Wait to Receive,Watch the youTube video if you want a good description of this product. [...] Everyone is complaining that they own the videos and that WB is trying to rip them off: It would not have been possible for them to release all the movies at once and still give people what they wanted. A less greedy consumer waits before buying them. Anyone who is a fan of series movies knows not to buy the movies until all are released. There is always going to be something bigger and better and this looks amazing! I LOVE Harry Potter and I can't wait until my kids are old enough for me to share the books and this set with them. In the mean time this will be a great 30th birhday present for me and 27th birthday present for my husband.
3,WOW!!,"At the price that WB is wanting for this, I don't think so!!!!! AYFKM with that price, I mean seriously this has to be a mistake. There is no way someone is going to fork over THAT much money for something that has already been released previously, just all packed together and WB slapping a huge price tag on it hoping and thinking there is going to be fans lined out the door to grab one! We have all seen the movies, and many of us if not ALL Harry Potter fans have every single DVD or Blu-Ray that has been released. Please, don't try to tell me there is 5 hours of never before seen blah blah blah, we've seen it you just want to rip us off by having us HP fans think we're getting something brand new. Now if you want to include a couple replica wands with an autograph of the actor who used that wand in the film with a COA, then the price would make more sense IMHO."
1,WB is taking advantage of us,We are the best fandom in the world. It's as easy as that. And WB is taking advantage of that! 350 for basically no new information? What. The. Hell!
5,Ground Breaking Christian Industrial Album!,"This was a ground breaking album for Jyro and Jerome. The song ""Enfleshed"" reamains a defining song in the genre."
5,Easy & quick recipes!,"I made several recipes in the candy making section of the book and they all turned out great! One of my favorites, which also got rave reviews from friends who received some delicious gifts, was the home-made hot cocoa with tiny marshmallows. It is so good that I no longer buy the canned powdered mixes from the store. This recipe puts them all to shame and it only takes 5 minutes to make! This book has so much variety with the different chapters: cookies, candies, breads, main dishes, etc., it would make a fabulous gift for anyone who enjoys cooking; (even if that's only around the holidays). Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"
5,Various recipes from simple to more complex,I used this cookbook at my sil's this past weekend when doing our annual cookie marathon. This cookbook has many great recipes and I'm looking forward to trying more in the weeks to come before Christmas. I think it would make a great wedding present as many of the recipes are not just for the holidays.
2,Nothing unique,"I spend a lot of time baking and making edible homemade gifts for Christmas. I was looking for something unique and though I'll try some of the recipes, they are pretty standard."
2,Nice watch. Cheesy for the price,"I ordered this watch thinking cool, swiss and golf. I really looks like a golf ball. For a $100 novelty watch, I would definitely avoid it. The watch is nice, but looks incredibly cheesy. By a nice ESQ or a Movado. This will just make you look like a wanna be."
3,"old ""skool"" kung fu","I was extremely dissapointed in this Gordon Liu flick,,,infact I still can't figure out why he accepted or even played the roll he did,,an evil ruler. It did not fit him what so ever and he played it very poorly!!! Also,,,bad picture quality, bad story line and the fights were nothing special. Yeah,,in the end he did a few things,,but like I said nothing special. I would not recommend this flick what so ever!! I'm gald I only paid $3.89 Canadian!!"
3,Albioni Concerto...so lovely,Just heard Guy Touvron's interpretation of Concerto for Trumpet in D Minor Op. 9-2 by Tomaso Albioni on Accuradio. Touvron's rendition is lovely and enchanting. If the rest of the album is as good I'll give it a try.
4,Overall good,"Touvron's playing is good in most areas, but his tone is occasionally a bit nasally or shallow. For the most part, however, this an album worth purchasing. The Albinoni transcription in particular is a good recording, with a beautiful second movement. Touvron's lyricism is impressive."
3,A little disappointed,"I bought a video for my son for Christmas. The video plays fine, but the cover which was described to be ""rough around the edges"" was totally trashed. Bent, crinkles,ripped, etc. I was glad he's only 2 1/2 and could care less and my older kids knew I bought it used and it wasn't from ""Santa"". I would have liked to know how damaged it really was, but video played well, and that's what's most important."
5,Wonderful!,"I recently ""stumbled"" onto Cliff Richard again (was a fan in the 80s), not realizing what an icon he's been/still is everywhere in the world, except the US! I've since been buying everything I can get my hands on, including this, his latest CD. At first I was nostalgic for the old stuff (Devil Woman, We Don't Talk Anymore, etc.), then I really gave this one a listen. Each time I play this CD (which is everyday in the car), I have a new favorite...""I Will Not Be a Mistake,"" ""Simplicity,"" ""I Cannot Give You My Love,"" ""The Day That I Stop Loving You,"" ""I Don't Wanna Lose You."" ""What Car"" is a blast, as is ""Thousand Miles to Go""! I agree with one reviewer that Cliff isn't being marketed properly, if at all, here in the US. He could easily be in the Top 40, Country, and even Smooth Jazz markets with the mix of songs on this CD! I'm just thankful Amazon is selling it!"
4,Good Value,"This book covers it primary subject (outdoor photography) pretty well. The thing I liked best (and what motivated me to write this) was the numerous tables and diagrams, especially related to basics like depth of field. For the very small investment, I'd rate this book as a very good investment for any serious ammeter."
3,Lunar eclipse,"In section 12, Celestial Photography, page 134, it is stated that the earth's shadow covers part of the moon most of the time. Wouldn't this be a lunar eclipse. I think the author needs to visit a planetatarium. Also, my book only has 160 pages, not 192."
4,Good coverage of the basics of outdoor photography,"The ""Bible"" is a good entry-level selection for the serious amateur. After shooting for over a year, I found several helpful ""a-ha's"" throughout the book. There are plenty of tables and numerous photos to illustrate the authors' explanations/techniques. It's a very easy-to-understand book and was quite helpful for someone who's just beginning to understand the basics of lighting & metering, composition, film selection, filters, etc. Another nice feature is that the book applies to those who are shooting on automatic or manual systems--i.e., it did not discriminate based on your skill level or the type of equipment you own. I'm glad to have this book in my collection."
3,I liked the opportunity to Test Drive this ...,"I liked the opportunity to Test Drive this product. I, however, found this to be somewhat complicated to use. It comes with an instructional video that helped somewhat, but it took quite some getting used to compared with the traditional needle injection. I plan on practicing and using it more."
1,altec lansing 221 speakers - mud,"This system is total rubbish. Too many reviewers are skirting around the lack of bass control: they are amplified speakers, so they should come with some sort of control, or advise to that effect at point of sale. I contacted them to ask for advice: perhaps I was missing something in the way of software. The person who responded obviously wasn't familiar with the problem, or the product either - I was told to keep them away from the walls, and put them on a carpet. Duh. Altec Lansing should know better than to let their name be put on such Far Eastern originated junk.Reviewers - let's be honest. They are good pro audio company's poor attempt at branding. I doubt they ever saw the inside of an AL factory, or warehouse. To say ""well, what do you expect for the money"" - is not good enough for the AL brand. Don't encourage others to purchase.AL - stick to pro."
4,good value-good performance,"These speakers are inexpensive, compact, good looking, easy to install, and most importantly-they sound good. Others have complained that the bass is too loud, but you can easily adjust this from your sound software. You don't need a bass switch on the subwoofer and I for one would gladly give up such a redundant feature to save some money. The only drawback of this system is that the subwoofer unit is not magnetically shielded so it must be kept a couple feet away from hard drives, storage disks, and monitors. The satellites are shielded and can be placed anywhere."
4,"Great Sound, too much bass","The satelite speakers sound great and have great treble. Although the sub pumps out sweet bass for the price, there is no onboard bass control (which makes the bass overpower the satelites with some audio sources that do not have an equalizer). One way to fix the bass problem is to do as I did. I took apart the sub enclosure, cut the positive wire leading to the sub speaker, then spliced in a good sized variable resister (same device used for the included volume knob, but a little bigger), then drilled a hole in the side of the sub enclosure and mounted the variable resistor, then reassembled the sub. I also put a black plastic knob on the variable resister for a better look. I now have a perfectly working bass control knob on the side of the sub, and it looks and works like it came with the system."
2,the bass bin a real loser,"i was taking my old Altec ACS45.2 speakers home so these new ones were to replace them on the office machine. you would think that the same [money amount](Canadian) 3 years later would get you something better, not worse. the bass is farty and there wasn't any amount of mp3 player eq tweaking i could do to get it to sound even remotely as warm as the older ACS45.2s did. very dissapointing."
2,have to agree with below,"[a local store] sells these great-looking speakers for [$$], which seems a very low price until you plug them in and find that while the desktop speakers are clear and crisp, the subwoofer is muddy and very loud an has no separate volume control. I'm returning them. Bad value so give it a miss, I advise."
2,No bass volume control??,"Unless you like alot of bass all the time and do not mind the fact that you have absolutely no control of it's volume, you will be dissapointed with these speakers. The small speakers sound good, but you can't even disconnect the sub since the systems power source runs through the sub. Not happy at all....where's my receipt?"
4,cool speakers,"My old speakers was nothing comparing to this speakers. Everything sounded just right, doesn't really matter if it's games or just music. It's just perfect for me."
2,"excellent treble, disappointing bass","surprisingly crisp and crystal clear, way way too bad that the bass was not complimentary.quite powerful for its size, too powerful actually to turn that power into good sound.looks good, but that really does not matter does it.even at low volume the bass sounds like a banging on the bottom of a plastic pail. i've done all i could to tweak it digitally for better results but still no good. i played music of various range, it performed the best when i played enya, the speakers beautifully reproduces her voice. but when you get to those orchestral soundracks with flooding drumbeats it is hardly tolerable to hear.i really hate giving anything a bad review. but this one deserved it.i love music and i think that my sounds deserve a better conduit.this one's going right back."
1,BADE,No base control the base over powers the rest of the sound I have worked in sound all my life and i must say these must be the worst thout out speakers sound is good if there was no basei do not recommend you get these speakers.
4,Too Much Bass is never Too Bad,"For those people whose eardrums are fragile, I do not recommend these Altec speakers. I for one love rich deep bass and these speakers have plenty of it, maybe too much. One thing which [is bad] is the inability to control the bass output from the subwoofer itself, because without the ability to adjust, the bass gets distorted. For those of you with the same problem, I recommend that you use a media player that has an equalizer control. Most Pc's have Windows Media Player and this player has a great equalizer. Without windows media player, i would have returned these speakers. Overall i recommend them to those who love deep bass; these speakers are like a ""minie me"" of a nice car audio system if adjusted properly."
2,Not for music with lots of bass,"I had these speakers for about five years now, and I didn't like them ever since I bought them. The bass is way too overpowering, and there is no control for the subwofer. For genres of music like rap, techno, dance...this set of speakers are not for you, unless you like to hear your walls vibrate along with your music. For rock, and classical music they will reproduce the sound fine. Even if I manually control an equalizer from a player, there is no way to control the bass.I only bought these for forty bucks, but I could have saved that cash for something better. Mostly they are forty dollar paperweights."
4,Good sattelites,These speakers I must admitt do have good sattelites for there price but I dont know what you people are talking about when you say good bass. My little sister bought a pair of Creative I300 speakers and they have ALOT more bass than these. Also these things do have a bass control right in the back of the sub unless I got a older model. Well I did buy these speakers used so maybe thats why they dont have the bass you are all talking about maybe they were abused. These things do have surprisingly good satellites alot better than any other brand for the same price in my experience. Overall I guess I would reccomend these speakers because they give you the option to upgrade to 5.1 with the extra ports in the back but if you are going for bass you are going to need to spend alot more money for computer speakers. If you want a good computer speaker with EXELLENT sound I would reccomend the klipsch promedia 2.1 THX!
1,poor,I wear a size 12 normally and the large was too tight for me. These are really not cut very well at all and i am extremely disappointed that a size that should have fit amply did not and caused me an issue in returning the item.I think you should be able to rely on correct or market sizing.
5,Works as advertised,"So far so good, Seamless install with windows Vista. Protects PC,Modem,and 22"" Flat Monitor @ 30% load. Run time 17 Minutes. Just as I expected so no complaints. Software runs in Background is small low cpu/Ram Load."
2,Disappointed - Very Disappointed with Amazon,"Pro's: Small(er)Con's: Only 4 Battery OutletsOnly 1 large battery outlet (no bulky plugs for this ups)Front light cannot be dimmed or turned offNo volume control (all off or loud)SOFTWAREThe software included to manage this unit its really a joke. This alone would make me return the unit, so with all the other failures (didn't even get to test how the ups actually performed...) I would ask for pain and suffering payment from cyberpower.EDIT:This item cannot be returned due to Amazon's return policy. More frustrating then i would have imagined. Amazon just lost most of my trust."
2,It's a loose cannon,I've owned this device for about a month now. Since I've purchased it the device has failed twice while no power disruptions to my residence where experienced and once when the power went out.It has since started emitting constant tones twice at random intervals and randomly stops without power interruption. I'm attempting to get it resolved through the manufacturer.To anyone reading this: Stay away.
4,No more hard drive crashes,"I bought this thing for my mac pro dual quad computer. Recently, a storm shutdown the computer and crashed my hard drive in the process. Luckily I was able to recover all my files but the hard drive is gone. The trouble of bringing it to the Apple Store 2 times in a day was hellish. I had to buy a new drive and then reinstall all my settings. ARggggg!!So I bought this this backup power supply to save my sanity. So far so good. If another storm hits I should be ready! What I like about it is it gives me a piece of mine. I don't really think I need this much protection but it's better save than sorry."
4,good performance but need better outlets placement,"The ups have worked pretty well. I have had already few instances of power outage without any problem. The only flaw is that the outlets are too close to each other; therefore, if using a transformer you end up blocking 2-3 outlets."
4,A great power backup,"I use this product for my CPAP machine. The only downside, like all battery backups, is the alarm when power goes out - but then again, I guess its good to know if/when the power goes out."
4,"So far, no problems, but...","I have NEVER heard of any UPS that actually works as long as claimed when the power goes off. I just have my tower and an LCD monitor hooked up to mine and I think it shows on the display that it will go about half of what was claimed.However, it has worked flawlessly and it was affordable. I'm glad I bought this as it makes me feel pretty secure about my computer hardware and about the prospect that I'll be able to save any new data if I have been lazy. I'm usually a sav-o-maniac anyway, but it doesn't hurt.I have read many ""expert"" opinions on this subject, and they ALL say, ""Get a UPS!!!"" This one is a decent choice. Your surge protector won't really keep your computer safe."
5,Better than expected with zero lag,"Works very well, I have a dish network 622 that is very, very sensitive to power interruptions (the lights would flicker and it would reset!) and the reboot takes a long time. This works well and has my 52"" LCD, DVR, aTV and two routers plugged in, kept it all running for around 30 mins with no interruption during a recent outage.Just buying another one now to split the load."
3,"works, but questionable","I had a previous 635va unit and it keeps the same system on for 14 minutes. This 600va unit only keeps it up for 6 minutes. Weird..... So questionable ratings.However, it works and works well. It was installed in an area with many power fluctuations."
1,"Tried to go green, almost","5-26-10 this thing is junk, we lost power last night everything went black no time to shut down, now the back up wont even power up. stay away12-09 This UPS seemed like a great idea, but it only lasted 2 months. I had to pay to return this to manufacture, and I m still awaiting a replacement."
1,Electric fire!,"When it arrived the battery claimed to be fully charged. Plugged in some stuff and popped it back on, it started beeping and powering on and off. Removed items one at a time - and then there were none and it stopped beeping and power cycling. At this point the battery showed completely dead. I left it plugged in to charge. Per the manual it should take up to 16 hours to charge, after 20 it was still only at 60%, an hour later it was down to 54%. I unplugged it and there was a flash from inside the unit and it started smoking. So thanks CyberPower, going back to Opti-UPS, I had two units for almost 5 years before their batteries died... and no fire."
4,Completely silent!,"After years of listening to various APC, Belkin, and TrippLite UPS units run their noisy 4000+ rpm fans 24/7, I decided to give Cyberpower a try. I am extremely happy to report that this unit makes zero noise when it is running in a normal (wall powered) state and has a barely noticeable fan that turns on about 30 seconds after the switching to battery power. The size of this unit is also very nice.I have a dual processor Dell machine, a 24"" LCD monitor, and a DroboPro with 8 hard drives connected to this unit and it is running at 44% of capacity (~18 minutes of battery time).The only reason I didn't give this UPS 5 stars is that I would really like to see a port on the back to allow you to connect an additional battery - similar to what APC offers in competing models."
4,It works,"I ordered this UPS to replace a 6 year old BELKIN that finally gave up the ghost. The UPS sits in a room that doesn't have stable power -- I thought about not replacing the unit, but I discovered that the computer and routers started ""acting up"" without the protection [random reboots, hanging, etc.]. Once this unit was installed those symptoms of inadequate power disappeared.I had been worried that the display screen on the front of the unit would be annoying -- but it conveniently shuts itself off when you are not asking for information. The information displayed on the screen is helpful -- especially if you want to know how much power your computer (and other attached devices) is using."
5,Excellent - Definitely Recommend,"I'm an IT guy and my systems staying alive is 9/10th's of my livelihood! I compared the APC UPS units to this one and the Cyberpower's price is much better, they're not noisy like the APC's (this one is silent), the digital display is easy to understand (even for novices), I get the same (or better) backup abilities, and this one is not as bulky and heavy. Thumbs up! Look no further and best of luck to all!"
4,Nice little UPS with Linux support,"This is a great little UPS.I'm very happy that it has Linux support via the USB port. I downloaded an rpm package from the CyberPower web site, and the daemon runs well on a CentOS 5 32-bit server. The auto-shutdown is not enabled by default, so make sure to edit the scripts installed with the package to enable alerts and auto-shutdown. A command-line interface allows you to retrieve information about the UPS state.I have not had a power failure yet, nor have I tested by pulling out the plug, so I can't comment on that (which is why I limited my star rating to 4)."
3,Doesn't support Gigabit!,"I purchased this for my NAS solution. It works as expected, with one caveat. It doesn't support Gigabit LAN. This was a real letdown because, with Network Storage, speed is everything. It only supports 10/100. The product description really needs to be updated. This is the only reason I rated it 3 stars. If the product description was clear when I purchased, I would have looked for something different."
2,"Probably ok, but was returned back","The company is extremely reliable and easy to work with. It was my fault, that I didn't test it upon receiving. A similar model was working great for years. This new box was not good enough and my PC started rebooting several times when we finally got several power outages in our area. It was about 90 days after I bought it, not 30 as it would be expected. I contacted the company that sold me this device and, to my surprise, they contacted the vendor and got an approval for RMA. I got a complete refund for this box. Excellent job, people! I will definitely recommend you to all my friends and will buy from you again. Maybe I was unlucky this particular time, I have idea, maybe the device was a little defective, switching between the modes a little slower, than my desktop was expecting. So I decided to skip that and live with no UPS for some other period of time. I have already gotten 2 UPS at home, enough fore now. :)"
5,Great job!,Does exactly what it is supposed to do! Holds a lot of juice and keeps a server going for a good while when the power goes out. I would recommend.
4,Pretty versatile,"One feature this unit needs is receptacles that swivel, as many extension cords have - it would be easier to plug in some of these power supplies that have an awkwardly large plug, without blocking adjacent receptacles. Otherwise a good unit, I use it for a home network & print server and some adjacent goodies. The unit came with a full charge on it, packaged well and in brand-new condition, along with a pretty good manual."
1,Beware!,"Installed Cyberpower on my brand new computer with a brand new printer only 2 months old. Noticed a warning printer light started to glow a few days after the UPS connection. A printer tech support said firmly that meant printer hardware failure. Soon after my printer stopped working. The Cyberpower was the only thing that I installed. Nothing else was changed or modified. I had to replace my spanking brand new printer. Cyberpower won't replace your printer. Read their policy. It's a nightmare.I replaced this Cyberpower with another Cyberpower rated at 1000VA and over a short period of time my monitor began to make a very loud hum. That one was sent back immediately also. Note, all my computer ""stuff"" is brand new.Bottom line; if you value your ""stuff"" be careful about installing Cyberpower VA850. It's made in China. It is also advertised with Green power but this VA850 did not have the official ""Green"" sticker on it or the logo on the box."
1,Warning: 4 UPS protected sockets but can only control 1 computer,"I was disappointed to find out that in spite of having 4 Battery protected sockets on their system, the CyberPower CP1350AVRLCD UPS system/software can only supervise the shutdown of one computer (or device?)in a power out event.This doesn't make sense to me. This means that the computers/devices on the remaining 3 Battery protected sockets will QUICKLY consume the battery reservoir and subsequently they will fail in the same manner as though there was no UPS to begin with.My advice is: on ANY UPS purchases to check for the ability to manage the controlled shutdown of more than one computer (and other devices)."
5,BEST for the money... Probably just the BEST!,"I read all kinds of unfortunate garbage about this UPS, then decided that Amazon would take care of me if I had a problem. Not only is there not a single problem, this unit blows away Belkin's products. UPS's have come a long way in the last 5 years. This unit has EASY to change batteries. That is worth the price alone. Replacements go for $13.00 each on the net. Give this little wonder a try. If I have to find something that I would change, it would be that you cannot lock out the beautiful control panel on the front of the UPS so, if you have small kids around, you need to keep them away from the UPS or you may find your system(s) down. The Online Software is Excellent. Best I have seen."
4,great product,During the Hurricane the power in my house went down twice in 10 minutes. After the second power loss my computers operating system was corrupted and I had to reinstall everything. I vowed never to have that happen again. I didn't want to pay that much but I felt I had no choice. 2 days ago the power went down again while I was working on a major project and the backup power worked and saved me. Well worth it and was very easy to install.
5,Great Product,"This easy to use product has saved me so many times. I live in an area where there is monthly power loss. One time I was working on a very important project. All of a sudden the power shut down. I got worried a bit, but the cyberpower beapt, letting me know that it is running on battery. So I just kept on working on my project and nothing was lost. This is a very reliable product. I would also sometimes plug in a lamp during a power shutdown. I just want to say, that this product is a life saver."
3,lasted about 5 years and six months,Mine broke today. The power button does not work so the side that is supposed to be protected has no electricity at all. I don't know for how long these things are supposed to last so I am just sharing for how long it worked for me: about 5 years and six months.
3,"Power keeper, yes!","The cyberpower CP825LCD arrived a little over a month ago. We have experienced two power interruptions and it worked fine . The LCD display is hard to read, unless you install it at eye level. The real test would be a direct lightning strike at someones residence. That's the review to pay attention to.A power surge would be harder to measure for the value of this product.The software is easy to use."
1,Specs way overstated,"This unit is rated 600VA / 340Watts. I bought it for an LCD projector that the user manual says draws a maximum of 290 watts, so should be 50 watts to spare? No, the projector overloads the UPS within a minute or so causing it to shut down and beep constantly, and this while electrical power is still on to the unit. I had to quickly pull the projector plug and plug it into the wall socket so the cooling fan could cool the projector bulb down. Returning the unit as defective and buying another brand with more wattage."
5,"Excellent surge protector/backup, just as advertised.","A snap to install, works great, perfect selection of outlets. And a great price! We've had a couple of power outages, and it performed exactly as advertised. If we've had power surges, it's taken care of those; we haven't had anything severe along those lines, and I hope we never do! Love the LED readout - even though I have it tucked way back under my desk, it's on end where I can reach the button to read and see the LED easily."
5,A peace of MIND!,"I'm very pleased to say that this product does what it says it can do. I experience many brown-outs at the first sound of thunder. I've had two brown-outs since I've had it and my pc didn't skip a beat during the brown-out. The feature I enjoy the mostly, besides the backup power, is the application that comes with it. The app allows you to schedule what time you want your pc to turn-on and turn-off. I have an 800 watt power supply on my PC, so when the power is interrupted I have 17 minutes to safely shut down my PC or let the Cyberpower shut it down for me, after 5 mins of being on battery power. Its a great product and VERY easy to setup."
3,Easy setup,"As stated above easy to setup, but in my opinion the plugs are to close together making it difficult to use items that use adapters. such as routers, modems and so forth"
2,Does not provide UPS Power as intended,"This is for the CP750 Model. I received this as a gift. It claims to only be at a 30% load, with 100% battery power, however after a full over night charge, running the self test does not provide backup power as intended. No alerts or issues, other than everything turning off and a constant tone, indicating the battery is over loaded?? The display says I'm at 30% capacity so I don't understand what the point of that feature is if it can't handle a 30% load for backup power. At the time of testing the software says I have 125 watts of usage. I will try the biggest model they make next, but I really figured 410watts would be a enough for the following:19"" LED MonitorCustom PC:AMD Athlon II 95watt CPUnVidia GTS250ASRock 990FXonly 2 HDs powered, total of 4 HDs but 2 are in standby at time of testing1 Case FanZalman CPU Cooler1 Linksys 5 Port Switch1 Linksys WRT54GL Router1 Linksys CM100 Modem1 IP Camera"
3,First unit faulty,"The first unit was defective after tying some trouble shooting tecniques suggeste by Cyber Power, had to return the unit. Friendly and knowlegable customer service. E-mail prepaid shipping labels. I just got it on the way back to them but don't anticipate any problems based on the level of service received thus far."
5,Works perfectly,This has been a very good battery backup. It is small and frees up some space in my home office.
4,nearly perfect,I like everything about it except the bizarre arrangement of hanger holes in back. There is no way to mount it right side up. This is a minor annoyance in an otherwise excellent machine.
