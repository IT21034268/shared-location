3,Warranty Service is really Baaaaddddd!,We bought four of these units. Three are working great. One needed service after only a few weeks. They have had the unit for four months and I still do not have a replacement.
1,Portable DVD,"I bought this dvd player for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas 2005. After about 4 months the screen went black and it had a butning smell every time we tried to use it. The machine was very well taken care of and never damaged. Unfortunately, I can't return it for a refund and can't seem to find out how to have it repaired so I guess I will be purchasing another one this year. I would not recommend this product."
1,Broke quickly and horrible customer service,"I purchased this item for over $200 from Amazon.com in the summer of 2005. After fewer than ten uses in less than a year the screen went completely dead. This item was treated very carefully, never dropped, etc. Getting in touch with customer service at GoVideo has proved impossible, either via phone or the web so I am stuck with a broken DVD player and no recourse. I strongly recommend that people do not buy this product."
2,stop him,"This is an average portable DVD player, no better than the Magnavox it replaced. It doesn't reliably play burned DVDs and at times has trouble with new store bought DVDs. The volume is just loud enough for a car. I looked around a lot. It sounded great but isn't. There must be better ones out there."
4,The best account of the Martha Moxley Murder,"Having followed the Martha Moxley case for ten years now I was pleased to find Leonard Levitt's new account that sums up the last 30 years through the trial itself. Levitt's prose is prosaic, but he is lucid and clear about not only the murder itself but about the subsequent infighting around the events. He reveals little that is new-at least to long-time followers of the case. But he brings in all together without covering old ground in more detail than is necesary.Levitt actually covers two controversies in fact. The objective drama about the crime itself and the multiple clash of egos about the solution.Levitt's most telling conclusion is left implicit. It is that the Michael Skakel defenders, from Bobby Kennedy, Jr. on, always ignore, namely that any so-called flaws in the case were caused by the Skakel family themselves. They are truly a pack of loathsome drunks and psychpaths. And that is clear beyond a reasonable doubt."
2,Conviction,This was not a crime investigation...it was an autobiography. I got lost in the author's accounting of his personal life and didn't learn much about the Martha Moxley murder.
4,Great Book,"This book seems to be the most reliable book as to how the case unfolded. It was absolutely to Frank Garr's credit that this book and the case ever got to trial.Len Levitt says in the book that it was coincidental that Herr Furhman's book came out and the grand jury was convened. I agree. However, I agree with RFK Jr. that there was not enough evidence presented to convict. I was floored when M.S. was convicted!"
1,Conviction,"One of the three suspects was convicted in 2004. Legally, in my opinion, the other two (including the murderer) cannot be tried. Very little new material was introduced in this book."
5,"Greta, intense book!","A friend told me about this book, I read it and quickly ordered it so that my huband and family can pass it on. A prophetic writer whose bear witness to the Bible."
2,dougv,"I bought the book because the author is of high integrity and has an excellent Christian track record.Reading the book showed me it was a mistake to buy it.The author doesn't give references for his quotes or facts, which is basic for a book such as this.He repeats comments over and over. Thus chapters 3-end of the book are not worth reading. This is a shame,because the topic of judgment by God is so important. The US is now a post Christian country and no longerdeserves to be blessed by God. If we're not blessed, what remains is curses. All that can save us is God, andthus Christians need to pray and repent for the sins of the US.The author says that times of prosperity precede God's judgment, and that the prosperity is given so the people will repent. I don't agree. Prosperity will lull us into enjoying the good times, followed by greed andseeking power. Look at the book of Revelation and notice the God brings judgment so people will be led to repent."
1,Why does he fail to mention Christ's role?,"Wilkerson refers mainly from the Old Testament. He holds up Christ as a prophet. When someone speaks about God's judgment it matters greatly where they speak from. Wilkerson claims to know God's voice. He says that God is going to purge America, because God's holiness demands it.Wilkerson has not represented Christ as God's only Son and our Lord who was crucified, died, was buried, arose again from the dead on the third day, and shall come to judge the living and the dead. Wilkerson has chosen to speak about God's judgment and he has chosen not to acknowledge Christ's role. How can this book possibly represent a Christian world view?"
5,Suspenseful and intelligent . . . Recommended read,"When a yuppie banker finds an abandoned baby girl on the floor of a bus station restroom, he ignites the passions, greed, and madness that were lying just beneath of the surface of seemingly ordinary lives. As we watch helplessly, the situation slowly spirals out of control, and the characters' carelessness, secrets, and lies lead inevitably to tragedy. Livesey shows us that we are all criminals waiting for the right set of circumstances to reveal our crimes. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and would recommend it. Not exactly a mystery, or even a thriller, it is a well-written, intelligent, and suspenseful novel which I COULD put down but looked forward to picking up again."
5,It Isn't Always What It Seems To Be,"Psychologist Michael Stone deals with some fairly complicated cases of unusual sexual expression. When a physician comes to her for assessment, we are led into a web of events that are thoroughly engaging. Author Anna Salter provides Stone with a wonderfully strong and likeable personality. Michael Stone is a woman on a mission. She is strong and determined. She speaks her mind. She is no pushover therapist who accepts everything her clients have to report to her without question. White Lies grows into a complex mystery that takes time to unwind. As a reader, I was totally taken by the story. Salter is an excellent storyteller."
2,A book about women's issues?,"The author seems more intent on presenting women's issues than a good story. The men are all ""lightweights"".It would have been better if she had told the story as a story and not a set of hidden lessons."
3,Timpa Duet Lace,"This bra accomplished what I wanted in lift, sheerness, and attractive. But, I wore it to work, and by the end of the day, the hooks felt like a knife poking into my back."
2,so-so bra,"The bra looks like the picture, but the material is flimsy--you can see right through it like gauze--and I'd sure hand wash it because I think machine washing would do it in!"
2,mesh fabric is not flattering,"although, the overall shape is very sexy, the mesh fabric is not very flattering for small brea breasts. it pushes the breasts down. maybe, a size b or larger would not have an issue with this."
3,Question,Does the lace texture show through t-shirts and sweaters or is it actually smooth? Please let me know if any one has had texture show through problems. Thanks.
4,Great bra!,"For a small breasted woman like myself, this bra is perfect. I don't require a lot of lift and I don't want to ""add"" size. I just wanted a bra to hold the girls in place and this bra delivers. It is sexy enough for those intimate moments and still functional for everyday wear. The lace is pretty, yet sturdy. I don't dry it in the dryer, but you can wash it with your regular loads. Overall, this was a great purchase, and I will probably buy one just like it. The only negative is the shoulder straps don't have a lot of extra material to lengthen the straps, so if your weight fluctuates a lot, it may become too tight, but I don't have that problem. Hope this helps."
4,great start to learning about Southeast Asia,"This is a wonderful introduction to the history of Southeast Asia, ranging from the early modern period of the region to the influence of colonialism on the society and culture of Southeast Asian countries. There is also good background information on the individual countries which comprise the area."
4,"excellent, don't listen to the other reviews","This is a fantastic movie if you like animal house type humor, 5 stars, baby!!!"
3,"A few gutbusting moments, but not stellar overall...","I'm an ardent fan of the Farrelly brothers; they make FUN films. However, this sophomore entry is easily their weakest. This could be attributed to the lack of Farrelly involvement in Kingpin's screenplay, and the entire film would generally be a waste if not for Bill Murray. This man, given the proper role, is the funniest supporting actor I have ever seen (Caddyshack, Rushmore, etc.), and is responsible for this film's truly funny moments. The rest of the film consists of weak gags combined with half-hearted attempts to make you care about the characters they abuse with the aforementioned gags. This combination was successful in Dumb and Dumber (because it was actually funny), but not in Kingpin.Definitely watch Kingpin (if only for the Bill Murray segments), but don't purchase it without viewing first..."
2,FATAL PINHEADS: The Brothers had something here!,"Kingpin (1996) Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, Vanessa Angel, Bill Murray, Chris Elliott, William Jordan, Richard Tyson, Lin Shaye, D: Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly. A former bowling champ ends up a haplessly hook-handed (and bald) bowling manager for an innocent Amish man, who has a powerful swing. Blood relative of DUMB AND DUMBER (with the same two pinhead directors) has a lot going for it, some outrageous gags and laugh-out-loud punch lines, others just plain disgusting. But very stupid . . . and heavy-handed comedy lurches in the gutter. A spare that had potential. Running Time: 113 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude, sex-related humor and a drug scene."
2,Who wrote this? What were they thinking?,"O.K. i'm a huge fan of the Farelly Brothers. I loved ""There's something about Mary"", ""Dumb and Dumber"" is my favorite comedy of all time ""Me, Myself and Irene"" was not bad either but what the ... were they thinking here? This movie is not funny. It has a horible cast. Besides ""White Men Can't Jump"" Woody Harrelson is just a waste in every movie he makes, Bill Murray is another overrated un-funny actor. This plot is so stupid, bowling ladies and gentleman the Farelly Brothers did a movie about frikkin bowling. Haven't seen it? Don't bother."
5,God bless the Farrellys for bringing this to us,"Oh how I love this movie!! I'm tired of people, namely critics, panning it!! It's just too funny. There are so many scenes that are truly memorable, I can't even begin to tell them. One that truly stands out is what Roy has to do in order to appease his landlady. You feel quite sorry for him from that point on. Bill Murray proves that he is a comedic god when given good material; Harrelson and Quaid do very nicely in their respective roles. Good film to watch when you're in the mood for outrageous comedy. If you like this, you should also check out ""There's Something About Mary"", the comedy that took the theaters by storm last year. Please, guys, don't keep us waiting!! Bring on the next grossfest!!"
5,If you've never seen a Farrelly Brothers Movie Make This One Your First,"This movie has enough dark humor but unlike ""dumb and dumber"" it is actually funny and doesn't rely on stupid fraternity jokes to make it work."
5,Great comedy movie,This is one of the funniest bowling movies ever. The DVD I received was in great shape and I was thrilled to have it.
5,"""I think you shook something loose, Tiger!!!""","Yes it's irreverent and disgusting, but that's what makes it work so well! This is such a cleverly written film, I don't see how anyone would not be rolling in the aisles laughing. If you found this to be a bad movie, I hope you get Munsoned!"
5,Bill Murray is just hilarious,"As the rival of Roy Munson.Quaid is decent with the role of a naive,Amish protege of Munson who shows promise as a bowler.Disgusting humor and Bill Murray combined make this one a winner.Better than Dumb and Dumber and Something about Mary...Put together."
1,This movie stinks,I sent this movie to my son and it got there (in Arizona.) In perfect condition. That's all I can say.
3,not in condition as described,"DVD not in condition as promised, movie is scratched and does not play towards the middle to the movie. Love this movie and can not watch it, unhappy about it."
4,Too Crazy,"Mix a mormon, a tough woman, a failed former bowling champ and a smarmy bowling rival, and this hillarious film is the result. Just as gross, juvenile, and tasteless as you would think from reading the description, but don't let that put you off!"
2,Not what I expected,"Seller of king pin DVD stated this was a new copy of the movie. Although, it was a good copy, it was a homemade DVD probably dled off the Internet. The case, was flimsy and the actual DVD was plain silver, without the title o the movie on it. The picture was perfect clear, and it was an excellent copy, however not worth the price of a new, original DVD, as was stated when I purchased it."
5,This is one funny movie,"How can anyone say this movie is not funny. It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The bathroom humor is sickening, but hilarious. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would."
3,Original Theatrical Version MUCH BETTER--WHERE IS IT?,"Again, as in The 40 Year Old Virgin, we have what was a classic comedy re-edited for its dvd release, and made all the poorer for it. Why won't they release the original theatrical version of Kingpin on DVD--it was PERFECT as it was. The gags they re-inserted for the DVD release add nothing and actually detract. I wish I'd never sold my old VHS, which had an untampered with version. The original version was easily the best flick the Farrelly Brothers or Woody Harrelson ever made.The original Kingpin was FAR superior to Something About Mary.Bring us the original!"
3,Funny Movie,"I personally thought the movie was ok. I originally bought it for my boyfriend because he is a big bowling fan, but it is defitnitely funny. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who dosen't neccassiraly get dry humour."
1,I had to give it one Star - That is as low as they go!,"There is only one reason to watch this movie. And that is for Bill Murray's performance. Horrible story line, with an ex-champion bowler (Woody H.) who loses his hand because he con'd some high rollers in a bowling game.Now 17 years later he is a boozed out, washed up bum. Murray is wonderful in his part as a slick, fancy talking bowler. I can't believe I watched the whole thing. There should be a minus rating on this one. Do the dishes instead."
1,Pointlessly gross,"As Monty Python suggested, ""eating a lump of freezing cold poison"" would be more pleasant than watching this film. By losers, for losers, and about losers."
1,One of the two worst movies I have ever seen,"This movie is not only bad, it will make you feel like taking a shower after watching it.Let me first say that I think that most comedy like South Park, George Carlin, Monty Python and the like are great -- I'm not easily grossed out or offended, but this movie was staggeringly bad. Awful writing, unforgettable (in the worst sense of the word) lower than bathroom humor, and just a mean, depressing, completely unredeemable movie."
1,disgusting movie.it grossed me out,"there are just so many nasty parts in this movie.if they would of left those out,i would have liked this movie.like when woody harrelson threw up.and when randy quaid was flossing and chunks of food flew everywhere and all over the mirror."
5,STRIKE!,If slapstick humour is your thing and you enjoyed Dumb and Dumber you will love this. The Farrelly Brothers have once again created a comedy masterpiece. A great script coupled with outstanding performances from Woody and co make this a must have film for anybody with a sense of humour. Don't be a MUNSON buy it now!
4,"That was oh so funny, but just a little long","I think the scenario here is slightly too long, because we're a little tired waiting for the Reno tournament. But hey guys this is still a great movie that can't wait to deliver some laughter in cans to you and your video. You gotta see that one, and try not to sleep when it's getting a little boring for ten or fifteen minutes. You will also find out that the fourth or fifth time you see Kingpin, you wanna kill Bill Murray. Don't worry, that's a normal reaction..."
5,ONE OF THE BEST COMEDIES EVER MADE IN HISTORY !!!!!!!!!,"I sae this one when I was six years old. Of cours I didn't understand then, but I laughed my ass off. Now I rented it two days before Christmas last year and I understood more and laughed even harder than the last time I've seen wich was seven years ago. I love this one. I'm not gonna tell you the plot about this one either, but I strongly suggest you watch this one right now. This is the best FARRELY'S BROTHER movie along with ""There's Something About Mary"". I love this two. I'm not that much of a ""Dumb And Dumber"" fan.I think you should purchase or rent this one. It is simply one of the best comedies of the century and the best perfomance by Woody Harelson. I think I am gonna watch it again right now. If you want to do the same, then I'm with you."
4,Hilarious bowling comedy,"Think of ""The Color of Money"" but with bowling instead of pool and that's Kingpin, oh plus add a (...) load of laughs. Randy Quaid is fantastic as a clueless bowling amish, I mean this guy does number 2 in a urinal for gods sake, lol. Woody Harrelson is great too as a former hot shot bowler that loses it all including his hand but gains something back when he takes Quaid under his wing. Oh plus Vanessa Angel is good too especially the scene where she dances around in small skirts to disract the other bowler. This film has a lot of rauncy laughs and then some yet the funniest thing about it would have to be how serious everyone takes bowling in this movie. Kingpin is the Farrelly's least popular yet it's the funniest in my book."
4,A fine comedy,"Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) is a former state bowling champion whose hand was destroyed by gamblers. Years later, broke and down on his luck, he gets a second chance when he meets an Amish bowling whiz named Ishmael (Randy Quaid). The two head for a million-dollar bowling tournament in Reno. Bill Murray is excellent in a small role as Munson's nemesis.The Farrelly brothers are quite good at making raunchy, disgusting films with characters that we can still care about. This film also boasts an excellent soundtrack."
5,Hilarious movie!,"Ok, this movie is hilarious! If you like any other movie by the directors, you'll love this movie. Personally, Bill Murray is the greatest in this movie. In my opinion, right after Woody asks about the sugar, the face that Murray gives is the greatest part of the movie. Anyway, the DVD is great! There are quite a few new scenes, all which add to the great movie. However, pick it up at a best buy or circuit city, its only 10 there."
3,Oddball Fun,"What do you get when you mix a washed up bowler and the Amish? Kinpin, of course. Starring Woody Harrelson as Roy Munson, a once talent, now over the hill want to be bowler. He takes an Amish bowler, Ishmael (Randy Quaid) under his wing, hoping to use him to win the national bowling championship to make up for his lost chance. Craziness takes place and all heck brakes loose (to not give too much away). Great movie for a night when you just want to laugh yourself stupid at, well, stupidity itself. If you liked Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber, this one is for you."
4,A book of truth,"This is a great book with Harvey at times unleashing his full venom at the medical profession, food industry and fellow dieticians. He is speaking up for the truth and I happen to believe him. Why? Because I have tested and followed the Fit for Life principles myself and they work.However before reading this book, I would advise buying and following the principles laid out in the first two books i.e. Fit for Life and Fit for Life II. They are easier to read, gentler (probably because they were written in partnership with Marilyn!) and cover the essential dietary/lifestyle principles you need to follow.This book contains virtually the same text as Fit for Life: A New Beginning, so if you want to save yourself some money I would buy that one instead. I would have rated the book 5 stars, if it was not for this point."
4,"For westerners,a wonderful introduction","The late Fr. enomiya-lasalle, german jesuit and along with Frs.Henri la saux,Bede Griffiths, William Johnstin and Thomas Merton,are the great bridges from west to east. Fr Lasalle was a survivor of one of the Atomic blasts{a tv movie made about Hiroshima cast max von syndow as a composite],and an accepted Zen master while retaining his standing{as it was] as a catholic priest. the fact that he served in Japan with dom pedro arrupe, later to be general of the jesuits was certainly advantageous.This book, then is a compostite of fr enomiya -lasalle,a week long retreat ,as it were,a 7 day zen reatreat. The writing is non esoteric[somehow, zen can appear like quantum mechanics], clear and clean,like calligraphy. A wonderful intro, for people like me without the backround,though most definitely NOT A NEW AGE FUZZY WARM BOOK. There is effort[or better NON_EFFORT] involved here. Well, done, very well presented ...."
2,Gack!,"After enjoying Independent People, I picked this up and...dang...the bizarre, peculiar fable lost me completely. I nearly didn't read another Laxness book, which would have been a shame, since Iceland's Bell, for example, is a total charmer. Try his other books first, the ones that earn him a place alongside Marquez and Dickens, in my opinion."
2,Perhaps better in Icelandic...,"Even though I was intrigued by a review of this book in my local newspaper, and even though I often buy books, I checked this one out of the library. I'm glad I did. It may be ""one of the funniest books ever written"" in Icelandic, and I can only suppose that Susan Sontag, who reviewed it, reads this language fluently. How else to explain the discrepancy between the English translation, which is clumsy, full of archaic words, and often muddled, and the praise heaped upon the novel? Disappointing."
5,great cd,"if you already own their self titled album released by solid state records than this album basically the same with ""a little sugar on top"" (sorry about the bad analogy.) anway, love herren shows a small humorous side to blindside, it sounds like it might be a cover of some swedish hymn maybe. blindside is one of the premiere hardcore bands, Christian or not. the lyrics on this album are very deep and very insightful, i recommend this cd to anyone who like hardcore. especially korn, deftones, or selfmindead."
4,Sublime with only one problem,"The movie is beautifully made and the story is interesting and full of emotional content. The acting can be so convincing that one wonders if the main character is acting or if she actually suffers from the portrayed condition. The only problem is the quality of the translation in the subtitles, although I can only speak for the Spanish version which is the one I used.All in all, this is definitely a film I recommend strongly to anyone."
2,Imitation Is Not Always Flattery,"This was just a Bollywood remake of The Helen Keller Story. I do adore Rani Mukherjee as an actress. I like how she takes risk and this was a big one, but not one I favored. Also why did the actor, Amitabh Bachchan, keep on that stupid hat throughout the movie? Anyway, this would have been better with an original screenplay like Barfi, or My Name Is Kahn. Nice try but not convincing. Sorry."
2,black=blank,"holy smokes, what a cheesy, horribly acted, poorly scripted, highly rated (by indians i can only presume) flick. ive seen better film on dishwater that's set all night. perhaps coming from bollywood this is quality, but in relation to any films that are actually of merit or well made, this compares like macdonalds to homecooking..there is none. from the starting scene where the ""blind"" lady is noticing the snow...you can tell she sees it, from then on the acting is weak, the story telegraphed, and the scripting..well, you can take a film out of bollywood, but you cant take bollywood out of the film. amazing these other reviewers are so blind..or so biased."
3,monotonously dramatic but good acting for an indian production,"The same points constantly recur throughout the movie and the end is predictable, but the for a Indian production this movie is a breath of fresh air since it's void of villans, romance, songs, and dance"
2,the one week watch,"For a watch designed for kids, I would expect a MUCH more scratch resistant face. All of its nice touches are basically useless after a week when the face is so scratched that you can't read the time any more."
3,Battery life is suboptimal,"It's cute (I'm an adult, and I was looking for a fun watch), but the battery life is rather abbreviated. It stopped ticking after a few months."
2,you get what you pay for,"I bought these chips thinking that I had found a bargain, but it turns out that they are lower quality than many other chips that I've played with. The finish is not as nice, and the cuts are a little rough. These are about 20$ cheaper than most 500pc sets and I think it'd be worth paying extra."
3,Kinda worked,Used for an experimental project and to no avail. Not saying its the product but since it did not work....
4,Best bond game so far!,"I have the bond games Agent under Fire and Night Fire, and this game blows them both away. From Russia with Love is the first bond game based on a movie. Graphics are great! This game has plenty to do, with extra footage on how producers created the game! There is plenty to unlock, and many missions and goals in three different difficulty levels. Also, It's not only a shooting game, but a little bit of adventure and action is also mixed in. The game is third person, which is different from most bond games, but still delivers the whole package of fun and exitment. Anyone can enjoy it, especially a James Bond fan. 5 stars!"
2,FPS action,This is based on the James Bond movie. I tried out the game and it seems to demand a lot of button-mashing. It looks like the graphics are good.
3,Everything or Nothing it's not,"Like most of its predecessors, this game is a mix of explore/shoot and vehicle levels. The shooting is similar to E-O-N and still good: head shots are harder and you can pick grenades off the badguys' belts. Hand to hand is still there, but way more constrained and decidedly worse than E-O-N.The main problems are that the game is too short and multiplayer is TERRIBLE -- no cooperative mode and no `bots. That was very disappointing.Overall, a tasty morsel, but Everything or Nothing is way better. How about just a little more effort next time EA?"
5,Glad I picked this one,"I have a rather large collection of music and it was a shame I didn't own anything from Sarah Vaughan. I enjoy many types of music. What I enjoy most is a wonderful voice with talented musicians and I'm open to just about any genre. Sarah has such a wonderful voice, such a range and so clear. It gives me goose bumps. Clifford Brown and company are tight and clear, great stuff. I read all the reviews and decided to purchase this particular version. I have nothing else to compare with but I'm very happy with the quality of the audio on this CD."
1,Hillarious!,Thank god I got this at the library...and took it back the next day. This book had the nerve to even suggest reading backwards as a time saver. Not even worth pulling off the shelf. I have looked at several speed reading books and this by far is the worst...pure garbage. Check it out for a good laugh!
3,it works,"Made in Chinatown,China.Some how it is working, it said ac delco on the box, but its not made by them. I'll most likely need another one in a few months. I kept the old one because the one from China does not have any numbers stamped on it. I'm not 100% sure its the correct part . It's not kicking out a code, I guess well see"
2,All woo no substance,I repeat what I said in reference to DH book 1. I really didn't find it helpful or useful at all. Books 4 and 5 were by far the most relevant.
5,Woven Wire Jewelry,"The new and beautiful new magazine, Art Jewelry, has panned this book. I had decided to skip it based on the review. I just had a look at a friend's copy and I'm going to buy it. It is very detailed and the PMC stuff in the end is interesting.Anne"
5,Woven Wire Jewelry,"This is a must have book. Very easy to read, and understand how to make this wire jewelry. The pictures are very clear. Even those who don't speak English, could learn from this book.Hope to see more of these books by Linda Chandler. She is so talented and a wonderful teacher."
5,I finally found it!!!!,This is the perfect how to book. The pictures make everything clear. The last book I tried was very confusing. I read the same instructions over and over with no luck. Woven Wire Jewelry is easy to understand. You can learn from the pictures alone. I might even get my husband to try! I will be looking for more books from Linda Chandler.
3,Okay if you like lots of the same thing,"This book was a bit boring for me. While I am no wire expert, I was bored by the sleepy designs the book laid out.. I know there aren't a lot of options, but I was hoping for more creativity..."
3,dissapointing,"pros: elegant designsvery detailed instructions, step by stepcons: different designs but same technique. lack variety. there are many different types of woven chain, but not much in this book.i thought this book was all about weaving, but i found a lot of precious matal clay stuff in the book. it can be good if that's what you are interested"
1,Wtf? Only one weave pattern.,"I am a graduate student studying jewelry design. I was hoping for a book to explain different metal wire weaving techniques, and was very disappointed. This is just the same weaving technique repeated 6 times in the form of different objects. There is ONE other design for a bracelet, that a 5 year old could make without any instruction. The pictures are great, the tutorial for the ONE technique is great, but for the most part its a waste of paper.If you want to learn this ONE technique, feel free to purchase the book. However, you can find the same information for free on the internet or on Youtube."
3,"Lovely patterns, but too hard for me","Bought it for myself, but turned out to be too hard for me. I ended up giving it to a friend who had worked with twisted wire jewelry before."
4,Woven Wire Jewelry,Glad to add this book to my jewelry references. It came in good time and was in great condition. The book includes information about melding precious metal clay and wire work.
3,I was kind of bummed,"Based on the more glowing reviews this book received, I assume these techniques are invaluable to serious artisans. But, as one looking for new techniques in jewelry making beyond wire-wrapped loops and coil-making, this takes too many steps beyond what I am willing to involve myself in as a casual hobbyist.For the majority of the projects, you must either be able to solder jewelry, or have access to a kiln for firing precious metal clay. Silly me, I neglected to notice Amazon's printing of the first sentence, which is: ""This book assumes a basic knowledge of soldering."" It is a sentence that would have saved me $15."
4,Great space battles with and emotional side to War.,"Overall this volume does not contain a lot action but more character development. Kou takes out the Gundam for space battle before it is ready and ends up totaling it. Afterwards he is emotionally crushed at what he has done and wanders around in a city on the moon searching for a way to deal with his failure. He meets a retired Zeon officer who teaches him to be strong and to be a warrior. He regains his confidence and pilots the repaired Gundam once again. In this volume there is also a development of a ""relationship"" between Kou and Nina."
5,yosemite Sam VHS,"Yosemite Sam: The Good, the Bad, and the Ornery [VHS]Great movie. Seller great to deal withdi"
2,outdated,"kind of dissapointed in this book. fun to read, but it is just too outdated to get any real info....."
5,Keeps you guessing all the way,"Extremely well written book which holds your interest from beginning to end. It keeps you guessing all the way through. There is mystery and intrigue; tenderness and sorrow. It lets the reader see inside the head of its heroine and feel her pain and fear as she leads her platoon through a war, as she copes with the murder of a lover, and as she struggles with maintaining her sanity when it looks like she may be the next victim. The book tackles such issues as domestic violence, and what it is like being gay and living in a straight world."
4,"A great book, but get out your red pencil","Christina Bartolomeo's books are funny, engaging, and well-written. I read all of The Side of the Angels in one sitting, and I definitely recommend it. However, if you are from DC or you know the area well, the typos and inaccuracies will drive you NUTS...Loudoun is misspelled Loudon, (Upper) Marlboro becomes Marlborough, and so forth."
1,borin....,"good actors, ok acting but less on story-borin, not that interesting-who cares? no one?--waste of time/$ just to see it once. what can i say-no more i guess, one other good thing-id have to see it again to see if i can reap any more interest out of this one."
1,"depressing, almost scary","I was highly recommended this book and I couldn't be more disappointed. I expected a sweet goodbye to a beloved home, reliving fun memories of time spent there, helping the child emotionally deal with leaving that place. Instead, the illustrations are dark, serious, melancholy, ominous - like something bad is going to happen any minute. The people are frowning, the whole mood is very sad and depressing. If that was my home, I'd be running as fast as I could to get anywhere else. The prose is nice, but not for a young child. My 5yr old was frowning and confused through the whole book and afterward said he did not like it and didn't want to read it again. I agree. This book is for an adult who likes artistic esoteric children's books."
4,Nice Dress. Great Price,I bought this in black for a military dinner. It fit great (I used the guidelines they provided). I got tons of compliments. Only downside for me was that it does not have a clasp above the zipper. I used a safety pin.
3,"Fits like a charm, but misleading color","I am 5'8"" and a 36B and a large fit me beautifully. It hugs curves in all the right places and the fabric hides any extra tummy you might have. I purchased the sage, which looks lovely in the picture, but when I received the dress it is actually a bright lime green. I was looking for a gown for a black tie event, but the lime green seemed much too childish a color for it. I was sorry that such a beautifully fitting dress did not have an accurate color portrayal, and I will be returning it. Be wary of color selection!"
2,not for the pear shaped,"I bought this dress for my friend's upcoming wedding. It arrived quickly.However when I tried it on, I looked like a cow!I weigh 125lbs and I'm 5'6. (It was long enough) But I am a size 4 on top and a size 6 on the bottom- you know, the evil pear shape.Thus, I think the sash made my hips look really big and then the top sash covered my small boobs and voila- I am a silk clad sumo wrestler! I did try a padded bra- but to no avail. I was still kickin it bertha style.So if you are similar to me in size or shape I suggest passing on this dress. Even though it does look smashing in the picture. *sigh*"
4,Great Expandable Solution!!,"Panasonic has always made great cordless phones. This product is not exception. They work great. Take 5 mins to setup all 3 of them and you only need one phone jack - wow!. The VE (voice enhancement) feature is not that great but you can tell it does try to amplify the voice on the other end - it just is too loud and gives off an echo. The features are great and the volume adjustments leave you with my options (ring tone and ring volume). If you are looking for a 3-phone solution at a unbeatable price, this would be it."
2,snap crackle and pop,"the range is shorter than i expected, by far. there are irritating popping and crackling sounds when talking, when taking off the cradle, when dialing.mom has a motorola, shoulda taken that advice...i am becoming less and less a panasonic fan..."
3,It's a good phone,"It's a phone. It does what it is supposed to do; I can use it to talk to people. There seems to be a slight delay in between pressing the talk button and the call being answered. Other than that, the phone is good."
3,A modular with faults,"The selling points are that it goes together great.The cube is sturdy, and the laminate attractive.The sides, the top, the bottom are solidUnfortunately the design has not been carried through--the doors don't close tightly - a little attention to detail?the back is paper thin-- why not the same as the rest?The small brackets supplied for connecting another module are inadequate.The laminate itself is attractive, but is very delicate.I shall have to get a plywood backing to cover the back,and to anchor another module.Rank this somewhat better than an orange crate-- would gladly have paid a premiumto get a good product-- now I am spending it anyway to fix it."
2,Flimsy,"This value of this product does not even come close to the price I paid for it. The panels are hollow core, but the covering is only a flimsy piece of laminate - I hesitated to store weighty items in it, as I could see the laminate bending. The corners of several pieces arrived damaged because the pressboard is so cheap. The instructions were incredibly vague - I was able to figure out how to put the thing together without too much trouble, but I ended up with a bunch of unidentifiable hardware left over. Overall, not impressed."
3,No Quality Control,"Quality control was a bit lacking. The veneer was chipped in several places and one of the doors doesn't align right. Not worth sending it back because it's just being used for storage but annoying enough to mention for those who place it in a visible spot. On the plus side, it was simple to assemble."
2,very light weight,"I was surprised to lift one of the sections of this cabinet. It was so light weight. Very light weight for the price of the cabinet. I think there is a lot of hollow space in between the outside layers of the stock used for this brand. That being said, I decided to keep it anyway as I am not going to put a lot of heavy stuff in it. I would look for a different brand and will certainly look at the shipping weight next time. I couldn't recommend this brand to anyone at the prices they are asking."
2,Cheap,"Hollow, lightweight, and can be made into any shape. Just do not put anything heavy on them or have kids around them. They will break right through!"
5,Easy extra storage,"I purchased these to go above some white cabinets in our utility room to provide additional storage in wasted space. Although there's ""some assembly required"", these went together very quickly and easily. I'm very pleased with them."
3,Doesn't match exactly,"I was expecting the tray to be outlined in blue, like the dishes, as my mother's kitchen is a shade of blue and a shade of pink - the wide color stripe on the tray is green! Not blue. It will do as it was a gift but I wish I had known, I would have bought something different. I also bought the tea kettle (which is tiny but so was her last one) and it's handle is blue like I expected."
3,Tray matches the dishes,"This plastic tray is similar to Melmac. It's nothing special, but it matches the Corelle dishes and is reasonably priced. If you don't want it to match the dishes, you might want to consider other trays that are larger."
3,"NOt a bad ""New Timer""",Shaving sharp out of the box. Only disappointment is the china stamp on the base of the blade and the general fit/ ease of use is not up to the standards I am used to with my previous old timer knives.
4,Excellent study Bible,"This product was mostly as expected.....arrived in excellent condition and the size was expected, except for the thickness of the book. It is at least 3"" thick and it is heavy for me to hold......otherwise I am quite pleased with it."
2,Bible,Zondervan NIV Study Bible has very fine print. You also have to have someone who knows the bible to explaine it to you.
2,Okay bible,"I have been reading this bible and not really impressed with it, I have a King James study bible by Nelson and it is the best bible I have ever used, This NIV study bible, the editor gives alot of his interpretations of the scriptures in the commentary section. I don't think the bible has rightly divided the word, more personal beliefs. This bible is good for someone who is new to God's word and has trouble understanding it. Print is small on personal size."
3,Hefty filling cookie,"This cookie is truly substantial and filling, and can serve as a good on-the-go meal replacement. Reading some of the other reviews suggests that this cookie's flavor improves when microwaved. I try to stay away from microwaving whenever possible,(destroyed enzymes and all that)so I haven't tried that option. Served as is, the flavor is tolerable, but not exciting, hence the 3 stars. As far as an appetitie suppressant goes I would definitely give this a 5 star rating."
4,OK for some folks but not for me,"I had major hip problems and couldn't get up and down the stairs, so I ordered EZ Step. I bought every kind of equipment made to make my life easier with less pain.We had 1 stairlift at the time and I wanted to save money by not buying another for just 3 steps. But the visiting nurses thought it was too dangerous for me because the contour of the railing was not suitable. So we had to buy another stairlift for those 3 steps, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to go to my doctor's appointments.I had double hip surgery in Dec. 2011 and I no longer need any aids except 1 cane to go up all 14 steps. I am now pain free and doing physical therapy.I would tell the buyers to give it a try, it might work for them."
1,Not what is pictured,"I ordered these and I got a different kind of syringe, like the cheap kind that they give you at the pharmacy with your prescription. I needed the ones with the tip cap and the plastic black line for acurate dosage."
1,repeating our mistakes?,"A book of some vintage, yet we are hearing more of the same from a number of quarters now! As a church planter and pastor the subject area is of vital interest.Whilst I loved the chapter on relating to the world, I have one important question. If the church's debt to modernism is so bad, why buy into postmodernism in such a wholesale fashion? What is really unexamined in the book is a theology of relating to the world. Rather than capitulating to the latest trends, shouldn't we be a bit more discerning and affirm some things whilst rejecting others? The post-modernist project does not mind if the church tags along for a while, but is ultimately going in a different direction."
4,Touche! Second installment delivers the goods!,"The second Sheriff Joanna Brady mystery delivers the goods. It starts out with a premise that has you scratching your head as to how this can make a murder mystery or where can it lead? But it all sorts out throughout, especially tying up the ends when you understand what happened. It is sometimes painful to watch Ivy and Burton Kimball freak out. But Joann, her family, her friends, and the storytelling is so enjoyable, we can easily forgive this annoying side-family imbalance."
4,Officer Down,"TOMBSTONE COURAGE is the second from J.A.Jance of the Joanna Brady series. This series evolves around the life of a single parent, a child who has lost a beloved father, a perfectionist mother and a newly elected sheriff.What problem does the ex-insurance agent tackle first, the sex-pot receptionist, the deputies who can't handle a woman in the main office or murder, abuse, incest and danger. Fast paced till the end when Joanna finally has time to read a service manual on staying alive on the job. OFFICER DOWN's number 8 mistake is failure to call for backup or TOMBSTONE COURAGE.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County Novel"
4,First Brady Series Novel,"I happened upon this and 2 other Brady novels and am enjoying them...but then I really like the JP Beaumont series as well.So far the detail and writing isn't as ""rich"" as the Beaumont novels in Seattle...but then maybe I know Seattle better than Arizona. But the details in the character haven't built up as well either....maybe this will improve as the Beaumont series did."
4,Love Joanna Brady!,So glad I fund these books. They are really good - easy reading. And I like Joanna Brady and look forward to seeing how she progresses in the books.
2,What?!,I cannot believe the good reviews this book gets. It's 407 pages long and next to NOTHING happens in almost 200 pages. I was falling asleep. The only suspense in this novel was waiting for something to happen. It never did. I donated this book to the library after I made it past page 216.Skip it.
4,Really liked it!,"This is a must read after Desert Heat. It is able to stand on its own. Again, J.A. Jance is able to make it seem as if anyone could have committed the murder -- keeping the secret to the very end."
5,Very enjoyable,"This is a suspenseful story.Joanna has become the sheriff upon the death of her husband. She has a difficult crime to solve and faces difficulties in her own office and among her own staff. Many people are unhappy to see Joanna, a woman, as sheriff. Joanna (and the author) handles these issues with an appealing firmness and dignity.Very much recommended."
4,Entertaining book,"This is book two in a series of books about Joanna Brady. In this book Joanna is running for sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona.The author, J.A. Jance, does a good job of detailing the life of Brady and I felt that I got to know her fairly well throughout the story. I thought she did an exceptional job of outlining the relationship between mother and daughter during a rough period in their lives.This well written book takes you through the life of Brady as she runs for Sheriff just at a time that two murders are discovered in her town. The murders revolve around a 30 year old family feud of a respected family in this small town.Although the book was fairly slow to start it picked up quickly towards the end. Maybe a bit too quickly for my taste as I felt some things were left unexplored.Overall I found this to be an entertaining book, even though I hadn't read the first in the series. I recommend it to anyone who wants a bit of a mystery in an easy to read book."
3,"""...a Beginning""","That is what this rather simple book is, a beginning. Having been out of the MAC world for years and, over the past weekback in it, I was expecting more. But I read (or skimmed) cover to cover and found that one week of hands on has brought me to a point beyond this effort.With 10, 10.2 and 10.3 out already, this book is a bit behind. There are WONDERFUL (and I mean that) links, resources and 'further reads' listed and that is a great part of the text. But for anything beyond basic, I'd go elsewhere or wait for Hart to follow up. More performance issues, some step by step (for instance, updating Macs, bringing across email in a Windows network? How? Something I ran into in replacing older Macs)Overall a great effort and does simplify. It's a beginning."
1,No subtitles - don't buy,"No subtitles - don't buy. Good luck understanding what is going on if you are hard of hearing, deaf, non native English speaker etc...."
2,Decent,"It's a good practice balisong, however, the handles are not of good quality. When I first held the knife I had several random sharp metal pieces along the handle I had to scratch off with another knife. After a week of owning the knife, the tang pin (the small metal circle at the base of the knife) had dented the handles making the blade stick to the handles. I had to take another knife and crave at the handle around the tang pin... One of the handles was too loose also, so I had to took a hammer and hammered the handle. Paint is peeling too."
4,Which Rite is Right,The book is a concise overview of the current controversy in use of the prayerbook. It is not overly technical and gives just enough history of prayerbook development to background a lay person in church thought leading to the problems of today. If the author has a personal axe to grind he conceals it well laying the comparisons out for the lay person as well as the scholar to examine. I found it very informative and readable. Its brevity alone kept it from a 5 star rating.
2,Frosty Tragedy,This tragedy written by Mr. Samuel Johnson is as frigid as the regions of Nova Zembla. Now and then you feel a little heat like what is produced by touching ice.
5,Jose Jose's 1980-released classic gave him more hits.,"This classic album can be considered a natural follow-up to his 1979 bestseller ""Si Me Dejas Ahora"". Both the title track and the moody ballad ""No Me Digas Que Te Vas"" became major hits and helped to further solidify Jose Jose's stature as the most important Latin pop balladeer. While never released as singles, the album-only tracks ""Te Amo Y No Te Amo"", ""El"", ""Perdido En La Obscuridad"" and ""A Ratos"" remain both definitive Jose Jose masterpieces and among his best early-1980s recordings."
4,Very helpful for graduate class in computer games,"I found the first few chapters very helpful when writing my final paper for a graduate class in computer games and simulations. I was surprised when I conducted a survey for my paper that very few of the mostly female respondents supported use of computer games designed for girls in the classroom. They thought software should be free of gender bias. Of course, they didn't realize that much of the software being used in the classroom now was designed for boys!Ann Williams"
1,Don't bother.,"I expected more from this book. The title is misleading, for one. What the contributors offer is a lot of opinonage about games for girls, etc. When they start getting to the meat of the matter, commenting on female characters in games made for males, they drop the ball, and offer wishy-washy ""answers"" to potentially interesting queries. I knew this book was gonna suck (offical Art Historian's terminology) when I searched the index for Lara Croft references and, upon finding a few, realized that they spelled ""Croft"" with an ""s"" EVERY TIME. Do these people even know the games/characters they're talking about? I guess it's up to art historians to pick this topic up, dust it off, and talk about it with respect. This book will make an excellent doorstop."
1,Didn't get past the first chapter .......,"What a great idea for a book. It seemed really well thought out. I'm reading chapter one, and enjoying it greatly when BAM it loses me. While talking about Mortal Kombat, the game in the title of the book, it claims the game has no female chracters. So much for doing research ...... Yes, Mortal Kombat has females, even as far back as the first game with Sonja Blade. In fact some narrow-minded people objected to her at the time as she could kill or be killed. Street Fighter II which started this whole genre of games had a female player character and almost every game after it has had one or more. Recently released ""Dead or Alive"" features three females on the cover -- just the girls, none of the guys. Next time, check the facts. Anyway, I didn't read any more, maybe that was the only mistake in the book, but I don't know. Too bad, it's really good idea for a book."
1,laughably constructed,"This book has such potential. The topic is interesting and could offer insight on gender and technology issues. However, the writing is shabby (Nikki Douglas, anyone) and the book is a disappointment."
5,Grandioso,"¿Qué puedo decir? Bueno, que es una de las mejores bandas argentinas. De cualquier cosa. No sólo de Rock. Porque Santos lo tiene todo: Electrónica, Pop, Rock...Los Highlights: ""Desaparecedor"", ""Hombre Montaña"", ""Anti-Cuerpos"", ""Acople"", y el excelente cover del tema de The Beatles: ""Eight Days A Week"".En una palabra: INCREÍBLE."
5,A Very thorough Examination of the Nightfighters,"To try and capture the images of nightfighting in the second world war is a difficult subject indeed but our authors have succeeded very nicely. From the early days of Wolfgang Falck upto the bitter end in 1945. Close ups of conditions and aircraft with insights into the lives of the nightfighters. This book truely encompasses the whole period during which the Nachtjager were involved in the war. The rise and fall of the nightfighters is all there. The loss of valuable crews to useless tactics like dayfighting for nightfighters, the loss of Becker for example. The loss of highly experienced officers like Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein and Helmut Lent to attrition and accident is all covered in pictures and words. This book is a must for those interested in the story of the nightfigters."
2,Too tight,"I have pretty skinny legs, and these feel like they are cutting off the blood to my feet. Way to tight to use. Gave them to my girlfriend to use."
5,Quick Service,My order was filled and shipped very quickly and I received the exact style of pants cuff clips I wanted. I could not find these clips locally. I ordered my cuff clips through BikeWorldUSA.
3,"So-so, sometimes slips off","I bought this pant clip because it looked easy to put on and take off. It comes off too easily and doesn't hold my wool work pants for more than a few minutes. I'm going back to my velcro, homemade straps. Might work better with denim or thicker pant legs."
2,Tight and snaggy,"I had hoped these would be the answer I was looking for. Although they do keep your pants legs out of the chain, they are extremely (almost paintully) tight. Also, even though the ends are rounded, they are still sharp and can easily snag your pants when putting them on or taking them off. The search for an easy and effective solution continues...."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"THIS DVD IS A WASTE OF MONEY. IT ADVERTISES THE SHOW AS A CHUCK BERRY-BO DIDLEY ALL STAR JAM, BUT THAT IS FAR FROM WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS. IT'S APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR LONG, AND THEY SING A TOTAL OF 8 SONGS ON STAGE, ONLY TWO OF WHICH WERE PERFORMED BY CHUCK BERRY. FOUR OF THE OTHERS ARE BO DIDLEY SINGING ABOUT HIMSELF, AND THE OTHER TWO WERE SUNG BY SOMEONE ELSE. THERE'S A LOT OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES STUFF THROUGHOUT THE DVD, WHICH JUST MAINLY KILLS TIME AND IS USELESS. I WAS TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE WHOLE THING, AND WOULDN'T GIVE YOU A NICKEL FOR THE THING. WISH I HADN'T WASTED MY MONEY ON IT."
5,Inspiring story with never-before-seen footage,"I thoroughly enjoyed Man On A Mission. It's a unique and engaging story of a man with a lifelong dream to go to space and made it happen with lots of hard work and extraordinary focus on the end goal. One of my favorite films ever is Apollo 13, and one of most tense scenes of that film is reentry from space, but that was all movie magic. What a treat to see ACTUAL footage of a spacecraft burning through the atmosphere to return to earth. I highly recommend Man On A Mission for all space fans."
3,Tunnel vision,"It is too bad Miller seems to lack a general knowledge of the human body as it relates to cause and effect. His myoptic view has allowed patients to go untreated in pain as he focuses on a limited area for a cure, perhaps because that suits his student's studies. If you have numbness, even a ignorant person would suggest the spinal column. Not Miller though! Experts are great but they have their limits and should not pretend as people live in pain while Miller guesses."
1,Disappointed,"The 12 or so pages of what appeared to be photocopied questions that were assembled in a duotang folder should not be called a ""study guide"". The unanswered questions provided virtually no value and we were very disappointed."
2,Just like regular trash bags,"These bags are ok. They fit a standard box but could fit a larger one if needed as they are a bit large for mine.I use yesterday's news litter and I think if your cat has claws, they will dig holes in these bags. But they make for easy weekly litter changes. the draw strings are a bit awkward and my litter has slipped out of the bag a few times! I won't purchase these again, I'll go to the 99 cent store & get small trash bags."
4,van Ness eliminated the drawstring,"I love using litter pan liners, which I have done for years now. I can't find these as easily at stores anymore, so I bought them online. However, these liners no longer are made with the drawstrings nor does the liner fold over the sides of the litter pan as far as before. However, they are still the best liners on the market."
3,Pureness large drawstring,Fit ok and were not bad. Didn't really like the drawstrings they ripped a little bit when trying to remove them.
5,amazing,"This bundle is much more complex than its simple title, with in depth information on all aspects of music business, you'll find in the pack:-detailed pre printed contracts that will help your work and dispose you of any other outside help including lawyers-a great guide on how to do things and earn more money in the business-a great directory filled with the most important contact information oft he most important people in the business"
5,Bargain!!,"This is what you need if you want to get started in the business! This package contains all the legal forms you need, as well as the phone numbers (like the yellow pages) so that you can make your contacts. Also, it contains Ty's famous books that are guaranteed to be able to get you up and running in no time. All of the hints and tricks of the trade are well worth the price!"
5,Great!,I love this flavor for baked potatoes and veggies! No more butter needed. All of the Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasoning flavors are yummy!
1,Terrible movie.,"The other day i saw this movie sitting on the shelf. It looked kind of cool, so i bought it. After watching the movie i decided that i would rather be punched in the face for 82 minutes than watch this movie again. For 3 reasons......1. The video quality is at its lowest, it looks like it was filmed with a VHS-C camera. 2. The zombies in the movie are pointless, they basically play the parts of hobos. 3. The story is rediculouse, and so is the acting.Bottom Line: DONT BUY THIS MOVIE!"
1,Not even worth one star!!,"What was I thinking?! Whatever you do, do not get this film. I really shouldn't call this a film. It's like a home shot video, from someone who has never seen a movie before! I watched the first 4 minutes and fast forwarded thru the rest looking for something, anything to make my purchase worthwhile, alas, I was sorely disappointed. In case you missed my earlier rant...Do Not Get This Film!!!"
1,[bad],"I'm the biggest zombie movie fan ever and i also love a good ... movie, but this film fails in both respects. It's not even funny bad, just annoying and so low budget, the film looks like a home movie. And if this doesn't scare u away from the film, i think the fact that the zombies talk and beg for change on the street might keep zombie fans away. A huge waste of money."
1,find another movie to buy,"I read about this long ago in fangoria magazine.they said it was great,they were wrooooooong.I love low budget movies that have style or story,this flick has nothing.It does have lots of nudity by some people who honestly do not need to be flashing there stuff.you would be better off renting a dumb b movie than ...this."
5,Low Budget But Awesome!,"Booyah! This movie is great! According to the website for this film, amazingschlock.com, it was entirely made in under two weeks. That includes the writing and whatnot. I'm impressed. Clearly parts could have been better, but given their time frame, it is hilarious. It's about some weirdo college student who builds a ""frankenstein's monster,"" if you will, for a class project. As one can imagine, wackiness ensues. I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in the truly independent film market."
1,god i can't believe people like these movies! don't get it,"boring, dumb, retarded, unworthy of anyone's viewing pleasure. i could continue but i won't. very boring movie to say the least. i guess if you like a fair share of nudity then maybe you'd enjoy it but i still doubt it. the girl's carrying around plastic guns. at one time you can see the plastic gun bending and about ready to break in two. just couldn't believe i watched this movie. there is plenty of blood but i sure wouldn't recommend this movie. very bad living dead movie."
2,Ruined by bad performances!,"This could have been a interesting little addition to the mostly crappy shot-on-VHS subgenre of low-budget horror films. It's got an original take on the zombie mythos----concious, intelligent,non-cannibalistic zombies----and a fair amount of style considering it was shot using a video camera.But the lead actress is so untalented and wretched that she utterly ruins the movie! She shows no facial expression, and mumbles all of her lines in a very nauseating mush that reminds one of drug addicts or mentally retarded people.None of the other actors are in the least bit capable either, but at least they TRY to act. This woman is, beyond a doubt, one of the worst performers I've ever seen on film (tape?) and every moment she speaks on screen is torture.But then again, some people have said she did a good job! So who knows. The director is talented, and there are some nice moments in the film. You might like it, but I'm betting you won't."
5,a classic.,"Wow. What a great, original book. I read if for the first time in the late 70s...when I was 12 years old. It was a stunning work then, and remains such. I didn't care for the sequels that I discovered and read several years later, though. I think the story works best as a stand-alone book.Regardless, this is an awesome book. Do yourself a favor and read it!Don't get caught!"
3,very distinctive and original,"This is supposed to be a young adult book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone younger than 16. Much of the language and emotional content is very harsh. The plot involves a small gang of hoodlums with arrested development going to asassinate little furry bunny like creatures that live in a very posh burrow. There is an element of prejudice and hate crime to this. It is very harsh and aggressive. It would only really appeal to boys with more than a small touch of larceny in their souls."
5,"An extraordinary fantasy, why so neglected?","The Borribles trilogy is to anyone who was brought up in Post-War London, an evocative chronical of that City. This is a London peopled below 'knee' level by a band of waifs, who the Author describes as having 'Been given a bad Start', battling to survive against middle class Laws that condemn them. These stories are original and follow no other theme or type of adventure series. The Borribles as Heroes are in the main a fairly unpleasant tribe, but totally fascinating. Come on Publishers, for all those who have not been as lucky as me to have read The Borribles."
4,The bottle is 80% air?,"Seriously! The tablets only take up about 1 cm along the bottom of the bottle. Literally 80% of the bottle is air stuffed with cotton filler. What's up with that? Why bother making it falsely look like a lot of pills if it's not?Bottle size aside, these tablets are awesome. I've used several brands in the past, all around 200 mcg, and this dosage/formula is more gentle, balanced and even, and in my opinion, works better.But c'mon, MegaFood, it's not the size that counts...it's what in your package! ;)"
2,Not helpful to a traveler,"I found this book close to useless when I was in Brazil recently. It just didn't have the phrases I wanted to say. When I would point to a word in the book to try to explain myself to a Brazilian, they still didn't get it. I am going to look for another book before I go again."
5,The Future,"Central Intellegence is in a great position to make predictions about tomorrow. For example, CIA-Weathermen were the ones to tell the world about huge Mexican oil reserves a generation ago. Today, the CIA and the intellectuals who work for it, have a better grasp on the present than most American institutions. This edition of ABC News Nightline examines the forcasts and what they mean. Let's give ABC News props for tackling this topic on television in thirty minutes. The printed word does handle it better. But that takes nothing away from this program."
2,The skylark dives,"I am hooked on ""the Rogues"" series, and Jo Beverleys' books in general, but was very disappointed by this book. It was great to meet briefly a few other characters from previous Rogue stories but this story left me unsatisfied. The storyline had soooo much potential. Stephen finally gets a chance to woo the love of his life after 6 years and makes all the correct initial moves. Laura is about to finish a years mourning after a disappointing marriage.The villain has potential but after a good start doesn't show up to the end. Both lead characters seem to have constant mental sexual plans for each other, have both abstained from sex for 12 months and are alone in adjoining rooms for several days, yet for approximately 300 pages they act like siblings and not lovers."
1,LAME,I have found this author to be hit or miss and this one was a definite MISS. I spent .25 on it at a used book sale and feel that was a waste of money.
2,Ennui,"This novel seems to be an homage to Georgette Heyer's wonderful novel Sylvester or the Wicked Uncle which features a novel with an uncle trying to kill or banish the true heir to the estate.I generally enjoy Jo Beverly's work, but this dragged. The characters are poorly drawn, they jump to illogical conclusions and they spend far too much time thinking about themselves. It was, however, a great cure for insomnia.Do yourself a favor and read Heyer's Sylvester instead!"
1,Beyond disappointing,"One gets the impression that the author was being pushed to finish this novel. It lacks the attention to detail shown in her other Rogue books. I found Laura's obsession with sex, or lack of, repetitive and boring. This book was like eating chocolate chip cookies without any chocolate chips."
1,Tedious Reading,"I have read all of the previous Rogue books, and thoroughly enjoyed them. I kept wondering as I was reading if it was the same author, because this book was boring, and just plain tedioius. I thought the plot was really kind of dumb and there was really little romance. I would definitely not recommend this one."
1,So Bad...,"This story went round and round with dialogue on several pages of the same conversation. It was very frustrating. I always liked Stephen, but he couldn't possibly shine here."
1,I Was Reluctant To Speak Out...,"But now that I've read the reviews, I can see I'm not the only one who thought this a boring book. I was like, get to the point of it already."
2,Glynn's book falls short.,"When I bought this book I did not expect any new breakthrough on the proof of existence of God. After having read it however, I believe that the title should read ""God: Some Evidence, However Tenuous"". I do agree with Glynn that those who believe in the existence of God generally live happier lives and have better mental health, but this fact alone offers no proof of God's existence.One of Flynn's ""proofs"" relating to the effects of prayer on ill people is so unscientific as to be laughable. Near death experiences as well offer no such proof and are subject to many interpretations, one of which is that the human mind (of which we use a very small percentage) is a marvelous and wondrous thing and may very well be capable of such observations, fueled by one's life-long instruction and very strong belief in God and life hereafter.Lest one think I am an athiest, I am not. Having been raised a Christian, I, like others, struggle with the concepts of ""belief"" and ""faith""."
1,Not very inspiring,"I was given this book by my ladies in my book club group who are mostly Catholic, in the hopes they could sway my atheism. I gave it a good try, however the book has left me even more convinced that there is no God.The author misquotes Carl Sagan, not to mention that much of his science is incorrect an misrepresented.Science does not want to disprove the existence of god it simply wants to explain the nature of our world and universe. Science will hopefully continue to work to unravel the mysteries of nature and if religion would just allow scientists to do their work we can move closer to a better understanding of ourselves.It seems to me that when I see these books their tendency is to attack science as an enemy to religion, when religion is really the enemy to science. Science, it seems to me, has no interest in the existence of God."
1,Gylnn's argumentation is deeply flawed.,"From the point of view of a philosophy student, this book committs all the fallicies of argumentaion that I am often taught to avoid. This book left me unconvienced and empty. His arguments are deeply flawed and Gylnn gives very little reasons to back up his claims. It is a philosophically and rationally poor book."
2,Self-righteous and strident,"In the introduction to this book, Glynn states that ""there is no good reason for an intelligent person to embrace the illusions of atheism and agnosticism."" He maintains this strident tone for the remainder of the book. It is obvious he means to further a conservative political agenda; he later proceeds to dismiss ""existentialism, Marxism and Freudianism"". His ""scientific"" arguments are flimsy; they basically amount to: We're here, therefore we're supposed to be here, therefore there must be a God. Glynn's premise seems to be based on wishful thinking; he felt emotional discomfort being an atheist, so he decided to change his beliefs."
4,Good - but could have been stronger,"The argument presented in the book's first section regarding the 'anthropic' theory are by far the author's strongest ammo. After that, the book loses steam and evolves into more of a 'why I believe' line instead of the original 'evidence' suggested by the title. The point of disproving the accidental universe is gripping and hard to refute. I don't know why that could not have been expanded -- with less emphasis put on the NDE stories. ( To me, a folly of NDE as proof of God is : are we to believe God makes a 'mistake' of when to start the afterlife transition only to say 'Wait a minute - he's not quite ready - send him back'?)A good ( not great) book that ultimately sells itself short by going for the wrong target."
2,Unconvincing,"I was looking forward to reading this book. It purports to give evidence for god's existance that made this atheist believe!Then I read chapter 1.I'm no expert on physics or cosmology but I know enough to realize Dr. Glynn's assertions about modern physics are very weak. He is too quick to account the anthropic principle to god because science can't currently explain it. That is not evidence, it's just annoying. The section that sticks out the most for me is when he calls the possibility of multiple universes ""pure products of scientific imagination."" Maybe he should consider that it's possible his god is the pure product of his imagination."
2,Much better apologies out there,"This is evidence provided by the author that he studied to go from an atheist to a Christian. Although there are many interesting facts and points, the book lacked any connection and Glynn should really try his hand at something besides writing."
4,Repetitive arguments,"Patrick Glynn has done a good job of putting forward arguments for an intelligent creator of this universe. If they ignore the references to Jesus, the New Testament and Christianity in the final chapters of this book, this book could be valuable for followers of other religions too."
5,"Worthwhile read, well done","Some of the negative reaction to this book presupposes that the author intended to provide a priori proof of God's existence. The purpose of the book was rather to show how reason and faith are not in conflict, as we often hear. A good introduction to the research concerning near death experiences. Recommended for anyone who thinks that reason and religious faith are not compatible."
3,Raises intriguing questions it half answers.,"First, this is a short book of 169 pages. Unfortunately, that which the author does best, refute the implausibility of Darwinian science, doesn't apply to the whole of this work. It is in the first 55 pages that this book is at its best, and in the latter two-thirds that its sinks into new age mush. Too bad. Frankly, Phillip Johnson did it better in ""Darwin on Trial"". On the very plus side, however, the book raises intriguing questions about creation, which the Big Bang confirms. The incredible predictable order of the universe, and the existence of universal constants, the slightest alteration of which would have made life impossible, or completely changed the universe, leads to a conclusion that design, not randomness was at work. More on this, less on near death experience and pop psychology, and it would have been a gem. As it is, it's a struggling ""6""."
4,An Excellent Refutation of Atheists,"Our society is so skeptical that sometimes we refuse to stop and see the apparent. Dr. Glenn presents a valid case for the existance of God citing a new scientific theory, the anthropic principle, near death experiences, and a strong refutation against Freud. Although this book does not present nearly as much of an analytical approach as C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity did, it does allow for open argumentation with atheists on the very basis of their disbelief, science. This is genuinly a wonderful book, and I advise everyone to read it for it can be a guide in reaching a true spiritual connection. Atheists must sit back after reading and reason once again. Hopefully this time however, they will reason in favor of Glenn."
3,Interesting - but has some major flaws.,"This book was interesting, but ultimately left me unconvinced. As a Christian wrestling with doubts about my faith, I did not find some of his arguments definitive. In particular, that some people's near death experiences is evidence of an after life was preposterous and clearly does not hold up to scientific scrutiny. A much better book for others wrestling with their faith is ""Farewell to God"" by Charles Templeton. Charles Templeton is a well known Canadian journalist, as well as a former preacher and theologian. His arguments are compelling and presented in a much easier to read format. Although these two books have not resolved my spiritual angst, they are both interesting reads."
5,A fantastic guide to the Zippo collector,"The book is very detailed and offers a depth of information never seen before. It offers accurate guidelines for dating Zippos as well as a complete and accurate price guide. However, prices can vary significantly. Some of the items are priced lower than the market would allow today. The quality of the publication is very good. Excellent photos. Very well done.Christian Wenger for 'Spark International' lighter collector's club"
5,ZIPPOS,"The Bible of Zippo, packed with info, prices out of date, but the information alone is outstanding. Tons of Pics, dating and history of the Zippo. Awesome!"
5,"Great game for PSP, especially for those who also love play hoops","Ya'll, this is a dame great game, ps2 pic on your plam, Image that, and the game is easy to control, great sound over all. Only took me 4 mins to learn. Nice play back and videos."
3,First It's A Candy...Then It's a Gum..Then it's time to Spit it out!,"First it'a a candy, then it's a gum, then it's time to spit it out! They are ohhh so good, for about 4 min. My mouth changed colors just like it did when I was a kid. The issue, after about 4 min the gum was like chewing those wax bottles with the sugar juice in them. Terrible. None the less, it was good to have a few minutes of fun, and 40 grams of sugar in one pack. Who puts just 2 in their mouth! Have fun..."
4,"Good, Solid Steak Sauce","Heinz 57 is a good steak sauce. It has a unique flavor from other steak sauces. It tends to taste a little more like pepper and mustard offset by a mild, tangy sweetness. It's a solid choice for steak sauce."
3,"Not bad, but not worthy of a single release","This should have been part of a double A side release for ""I can't sleep at night"". It would've given Dannii a chance to finally release ""Sleep"" and throw her loyal fans a new single.The mixes of this single are pretty good, but like another reviewer said, the first 2 tracks are what this disc is all about. Stays true to the original."
2,Why?,"Dannii is a truly talented artist with an okay voice and good pop songs. But she rarely releases an album and prefers releasing dance tracks in general.I actually liked this song, but the reason I am giving it two stars is that it almost sounds like the original - and Dannii really did not add much to this to make it more sound like a ""Dannii track"". It is fun to dance and listen to - but I am sure it is not the best of her. She needs to release a full-length studio album to reflect her true talents and present a unified Dannii album with novelties as well. I am really sick of her single cds with 12 remixes in it. The price is very high too - I would prefer buying an album including this track in it , rather than hearing countless versions of a song which almost sounds like its original."
2,child's monkey costume-brown,"i purchased this as a halloween costume for my son. he is 21 months old and weighs 33 pounds. the toddler 2-4 size fit perfect! last year, i had a hard time finding something that fit because i feel children's sizing is skewed as far as what age it's supposed to fit vs what age/size it actually fits! anyway, this fit great, fabric was soft, and my son enjoyed wearing it. however, the fabric snagged easily and after being worn several hours on halloween only, it now looks old and ragged, and we were only outside for about 5 minutes. the rest of the wear and tear took place while wearing it inside. i expected some wear and tear, but the fabric snagged so easily and it looks well-used far before i thought it would! somewhat disappointing, but when i didn't know the fabric style or quality, i didn't know what to expect.cute style, easy to put on a toddler, seemed to be comfortable. would purchase again!!!"
4,Super Vac,"I've had this for about two months now and I have to say...it's a great purchase. It works so much better than my former uprights. And the turbo attachment picks up pet hair wonderfully. THe directions that come with it aren't the greatest...otherwise, I would have given this 5 stars."
5,"nice little unit, and a good deal","We're very happy with our refurbished Harmony vacuum. It seems well-made and performs as advertised. Very quiet for a vacuum cleaner: when used to clean hardwood floors most of the sound comes from the air rushing into the nozzle around the bristles.As others have stated, I wouldn't recommend this vacuum to use primarily on carpet. It doesn't have a powered beater brush head. But for hard floors and above floor cleaning it's a champ!"
5,More than what I had I hoped for,"Got my machine yesterday. Used it right away and love the experience. Vacuum used to be such a struggle for me and now it is fun.1) It is quiet! I expected it after reading the reviews but THIS IS AMAZING.2) It is powerful! You can adjust the suction level, I only use mild to mid range and that's better suction than anything I used before.3) It is light and easy to handle.4) I have hardwood and tile floor through out the house with area rugs. This machine works great on hard surface. It works great on furniture and area rugs as well.5) It takes care of my fine clay dust; cat hair(from 3)and kitty litter bits they carry around the house.Overall, I can't believe how quick and easy it was to vacuum the whole house, my cats were not disturbed, I was not exhausted, and the house was clean in no time."
3,"Great product, bad shipping!","Anyone who has ever used Red Line fluids knows they are the best. I have no issue with the product and have bought several gallons of the Heavy Shockproof Gear Oil over the years.My issue is with how Amazon ships the product. This last batch arrived to me smashed. The box was soaked through with gear oil. The container was saturated in gear oil. After pulling the cap off (which was smashed open and seal broken), I found I only had maybe a quart left in the bottom. I'm returning to Amazon today for a refund. Let's hope they do better next time."
4,Pelican Pic-n-pluck Foam,"Well, The replacement foam, came pretty quickly, and everything was there. It's a bit difficult to review foam, since, it's foam.. :D but i'm happy with it, does what I need it to do."
1,Do NOT Buy This Product,"My player worked less than a dozen times (and this was for 30 minute yoga lessons). If a company gives you only a 90 day warranty, you should know already that the quality is not such that they expect it to last long. I try to buy from companies I haven't heard of to give them a boost against the big names. Their service department was completely indifferent so the unit is in the trash and the battery recycled. Now I have the speaker units i had to buy in order to hear my lessons and no player."
1,ehhhh.,so this is a great deal and it comes with lots of extras but its already quit working making a horrible sounds and wont work now used it 3 times and now it a nice paper weight probably could have returned it even though it was past the return date they contacted me and all i just never got back to them as i see it as more of as hassle to return it for how little i paid for it so basically you get what you pay for!!!
1,Coby DVD5000 malfunctioning units,"We have two of these units and both come up ""wrong disc"" after several months of use. Coby says it is due to a damaged laser eye and there is no remedy so we'll have to replace them at our own cost. One was shipped back to Coby for replacement and the same thing happened after several months of normal use. I believe it is a malfunctioning product and Coby doesn't want to fix it. I will never buy Coby products again."
1,Extremely disappointed,This coby product functioned only two months for me. Hardly worth spending the money on.
1,Falling apart,"When I received this textbook, it was falling apart. The front and back cover were falling off so I had to tape it back together. In addition to the book falling apart, it was also covered in highlighting, which the description failed to mention and did not contain the CD it claims to come with in the title (which I needed)."
2,Jkhan,I got the shipment pretty late like there were delays en all and secondly even though it says that it comes with a CD rom it doesn't come with it like I didn't get any CD rom with it tried contacting amazon but they couldn't help since it wasn't there seller or something so yeah the book is fine i guess.
4,Finally something to watch,I really don't like what is on TV lately so I ordered these DVDs. Aside from the fact that one of my discs skips I really like it.
5,Very funny,"Its pretty funny. Great collection of the silly things that a lot of different people do on a daily basis. Defiantly worth buying, and reading. Puts a smile on my face."
1,Yawn,"There are some funny obsessions and compulsions in here (no, no, ""quirks and idiosyncracies""), but there's such a low-grade sameness to it overall that if you're leafing through the book looking for the side-slappers, as opposed to reading choice samples in a review, you have to be a very special type of person to stay amused. It's not particularly nasty--the author must be a nice lady--but it palls very quickly."
5,A Personal History of Ulysses S. Grant,"I enjoyed reading A Personal History of Ulysses S. Grant. The book was written so it was not dry factual material, but enjoyable to read."
4,john is an idiot,"I have something to say to this john guy, the reason you have the rights you have in the ""greatest country in the world"" is because of protesters and bands like anti flag, and the fact that you have had relatives in the military also gives you a biased outlook on war in general, just because the government says its true doesn't mean it is, think about all the stuff they ""have to hide"" in order to ""keep us safe"". Oh yeah, good cd"
4,"Not Bad, Why Complain?","I don't have a clue why everyone seems to down on this band. They're not bad, sound entertaining, and for a punk band, YES, can play their instruments and can sing, so what's wrong?Nothing!Enjoy, if you like face to face, descendents, etc, you WILL like this band.Peace From the Mid-East,Jickie"
5,Holy Wow!,"This CD is the best by Anti-Flag and definitely one of the greatest in punk rock. Their's a new era of punk where there's a purpose: politics and attacking the government for them killing and lying to us. The CD's focus is going against the regime of George Bush. No problem with that for me. It's really a matter of your politics. If you're a republican you'll hate this CD. If you're a democrat, anarchist, or just an independent Bush-hater you'll die for this CD. Honestly, I reccomend this to anybody for a try. To really understand what it means you're going to have to read the lyrics under Justin Sane's fast paced, yet remarkable voice."
1,Ha Ha,"Ok, the jokes on us right? The singer sounds like a 5 year old getting a shot. Anti-Flag? What an original name, bet it took longer to think it up then it did to make this album. Someone said this band is more political then the Dead Kennedys. That is like saying that AFI is darker then the Misfits. These new bands calling themselves punk are a joke. One right after the other trying so hard to be the next Backstreet Boys, America's pop icons or whatever. This is just more cookie-cutter pop putrid music calling itself punk."
1,Bin Laden's favorite band,"Once again we have here a horrible band with a horriblemessage. It's bad enough that anti-flag has to torture uswith extremely bad music, but the pro-communist propagandacrap just makes me sick. Here are two suggestions:1. learn how to play2. and for god's sake, if you don't like this country, thenplease get the hell out of here....please"
1,Sick ot this garbage,"Why would anyone listen to this crap? How anti-American can a group of white guys be? This country gives them everything and all they do is complain about how bad it is. If they hate it so much, why dont they just go somewhere else? We would be way better off without them. Last time I checked, not everything about America is bad. Being political shouldn't mean being anti-American but thats what this band makes it seem like. Anti-Flag should just get on a plane, fly to Ahfganistan and join the damn Taliban just to get their revenge on the US, the country that took everything from them and made them so miserable. Yeah right. I think they just complain to get attention. I understand that there are some bad things about this country. No country is perfect but to fill up every minute of every one of their cds complaining about it is a waste of time. I laugh at garbage like them."
2,Letter from Ray Reynolds ?,"First off let me say I really dont like the band Anti Flag but I do agree with their politics. I came to this page to look at the links for similiar bands hoping to find a band that sounds better but has similiar opinions. Anyway I was just glancing at the reviews and saw the one about Ray Reynolds. It says quote: """"I have met many, many people from Iraq that want us there, and in a bad way."""" but if you will go to this well known urban legends website: http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/reynolds.asp you will see that although there is such a man and he is in the army he wrote this letter before he ever went to Iraq. Basically proving this is a propaganda peice. How did he meet many Iraqis who wanted us there when he was still in Idaho ?"
2,I'm disapointed in Anti-Flag,"So many punk bands have been going away from there punk roots. I never thought Anti-Flag would. But after this album i am starting to think that they are. This album is nothing like Anti-Flag's old stuff. If you like Sum 41, Mxpx and Simmple Plan buy this cd. But if you're all for the old Anti-Flag stuff and loved there previous albums don't waste your money. The only thing i like about this cd is Anti-Flag's political statements to the American government. I'm disapointed. I'm going to see Anti-flag in January and I don't know if I will enjoy the show as much as I would of. There are some ok songs but still a really weak album."
4,terror state..,"You know, i was not impressed at all with the first four songs. But i find this cd got a little bit harder as it went along. Im tired of the pop riffs with catchy lyrics. Im not a fan of their new stuff as much as their old, but i guess when you become a band you try new things. You can't write the same music each record, if you do it gets boring. Hopefully anti-flag will get back to their old street punkish sound soon. Get this cd though, its worth it."
1,An insult to leftist propaganda everywhere,"Well, Anti-Flag has done it again- that is, put out another insulting album dedicated to the far left's cause. Being extremely liberal myself, Anti-Flag and their fans should take this review as a serious insult. The lyrics are terrible. Wait, seriously, before you pass this review off as another cliched insult of Anti-Flag, hear me out... Anti-Flag honestly writes lyrics like those you may find in a rebellious fifth grader's diary or something. Whatever. Listen to the Broadways for an actually good emotional and socio-political band. Their lyrics are extremely well-written, clever, and are not ""in your face- our beliefs are better than yours"" propaganda. Again, I am very liberal, but honestly who needs someone else's opinion shoved down their throat? That's not punk, that's sheep in a barn dude!"
4,crosen70,crosen70 is a idoit. Very intellectual. She is a prime example of the level of incompetence democrats expierence. - For your viewing pleasure-.
3,Older stuff i better,"Yes, this cd is good. I mostly say that because I am a fan of Anti-Flag myself. Their music has grown and now has a pop sound to it. I HIGHLY reccomend A New Kind Of Army and/or Underground Network instead of this one. If you are new to their music, I reccomend Mobilize, it has a mixture of old and new on it so you can get the feel of their music."
5,A musical masterpiece,"I love John's review of this album (somewhere on this site). He urges people to go to college yet spells every third word wrong like the uninformed moron he is. Tip: Learn to spell basic English words like 'rebellion' and 'believe' before telling anyone they are uninformed. Oh, and as for Saddam killing people, our good friends in Turkey continue their mass genocide of the Kurds - but hey, they don't have any oil. Take John's advice - get informed. Read a book. Go to college. Buy this album.The album is 100% political, and there honestly isn't a bad song on it. This is the finest punk rock CD I have bought in years. Musically brilliant, lyrical thought provoking, unless of course you are one of the blind idiots who claim to be informed just because they never miss Bill O'Reilly. Don't be a moron. If you like this type of music, get it.... otherwise stick to Toby Keith or some other idiotic, 'patriotic' rubbish."
4,the terror state,"fu*K you-this albums good, you want better go see them live,then tell me they're pop punk:)"
3,ALRIGHT,i think the music is pretty good and the guitar is amazing but i remeber from a new kind of army on the front of the cover it said something about not being anti the american flag but then it has a picture of bush and it says a 1-term president. i say just keep it anti the goverment then just anti america which they do on this album. i'd like to know what they think about the iraqis cheering in the streets today when sadam was captured.
4,Great Overview Book,"Hymowitz has provided a great overview of our current cultural syndrome. Unlike Kirkus, I do not think ""anticulture"" thesis is a strawman. Instead I find it to be a fascinating and effective description of the phenomena parents fight (or ignore) on a daily basis. The culturaly elite perspective (which permeates the Kirkus review) takes a deserved beating. I have placed this book on my website recommend list bookshelf because I think this book will help intellegent parents discern the background that drives and intensifies their parenting concerns. Good Work! Dear Mrs. Web"
4,Excellent Cautionary Tale,"This book is a through, annotated and well-considered inspection of some of the social problems related to youth and maturity.It's arguments are clear, generally well founded and helpful to parents who undertake this awsome task without the aid of a how-to manual.I recommend it to parents trying to make some sense of the crazy, bewildering and trackless journey that is childrearing."
3,Survivor Series:6th Annual REVIEW,"The sixth annual ""Survivor Series"" was the first to not feature a line-up of elimination matches. The night was headlined by a tag team main event as Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage and Mr. Perfect (a last minute alternate for the Ultimate Warrior) took on ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair and Razor Ramon. We also saw the beginning of one of the WWF's most historic feuds as the newly-crowned WWF Champion Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart battled Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels in their first pay-per-view match.We also got to see two specialty matches- The Undertaker versus Kamala in a casket match and Big Bossman versus Nailz in a Nightstick Match. The late Yokozuna made his WWF debut against Virgil. The night also saw the PPV debut of The Headshrinkers, Tatanka vs. Rick Martel in a grudge match, and a special appearance by Doink The Clown.The 1992 ""Survivor Series"" was not one of the better events but still a decent night of action. The traditional format was sorely missed."
3,WWF Survivor Series 1992 review,The only 2 two worth seeing are the Bret Hart-HBK-World title match & the tag team match bewteen the team of Razor Ramon & Ric Flair against the team of Randy Savage & Mr.Perfect. The rest stink like the movie:Mr.Nanny. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.
3,"Take your fill, take nothing less...","As stated elsewhere, this IS a great concept album...or more accurately, a great concept side. Side A can really be skipped entirely, not much there musically or conceptually.Side B is where the narrated tale of Happiness Stan unfolds, and it's really more a case of narration punctuated by songs rather than vice versa.Careful listening bears multiple rewards, as the story is charming, enlightened, and wonderfully psychedelic.The songs themselves are short and restate main themes of the story. ""Mad John"" is brilliant, but ""The Hungry Intruder"" may step a little too close to Hendrix's ""Foxy Lady.""My version of the CD is the Sony Special Products version which appends a live track (""Tin Soldier"") to the album. The CD's sound is generally atrocious and overamped, but the story of Happiness Stan is not one I can imagine my collection without."
5,"Brutally Honest, Wonderfully Hopeful","Avoiding the Greener Grass Syndrome is an absolute gem of a book. Nancy's honesty is refreshing and makes the reader trust Nancy's advice that comes after she shares her own story of infidelity. Her words are filled with the sort of wisdom that one learns only through making a tragic mistake, but the book is also filled with words of hope for every couple out there. Laced with humor, practical tips, and spiritual insight, Avoiding the Greener Grass Syndrome is a must read and re-read for every pastor, counselor, and couple who are ready to understand fully what God can and will do to not only save a marriage, but grow it into a thing of beauty."
5,Loved It!,"This book is amazing! Not only does she tell her story very honestly but she gives tools to help better marriages. These tools would be good for couples who have or haven't gone through what she's gone through. She made me laugh and cry. The only negative thing I have to say is that she didn't add in much of her husbands point of view. Since my husband and I read the book together, it would've been nice to hear the husbands side a little more. Other than that, I recommend this book to ALL couples trying to better their marriage."
5,Great,This book is excellent reading for any couple who has had to deal with an affair. It is told by someone who has had to live the experience. I would recommend highly. My husband and I both thought it was useful. It is full of suggestions on how to avoid falling into old patterns.
5,A Top-notch Tribute To Rainbow !,"As far as tribute albums go,this is one of the best I've heard.Niji-Densetsu nail the material musically and guitarist Akira Kajiyama does an amazing job on every song.The icing on the cake is that two former members of Rainbow take part on two tracks each-keyboardist David Rosenthal and singer Joe Lynn Turner,who has an outstanding guest shot on ""Spotlight Kid""."
2,It isn't new!,"I purchased a DVR as ""new"", placed it in the machine and it started skipping soon after movie started. Audio and picture were affected. When we examined the DVR we saw fingerprints and scratches. We flipped it over and the other side did work. There is no way the item was new."
2,Guarding Tess,"I liked what I saw of the movie but the dvd is defective and I need to return. It was a Christmas gift for my mother, Janet Young, who took upon herself to order a new one before I returned the original defective dvd. Please tell me how to do this. Thanks."
4,Guarding Tess === one of a kind lmovie,"Guarding Tess ******This is a fun, adventerous, well done movie. Wife and I like it. we had an off air recording, and wanted a DVD copy. enjoy an ocasional viewing. It shows Great on our large screan TV. It is A clalssic movie, one of a kind."
5,Rewards...,The entire movie is interestly woven to ensure the tapestry of justice is prominent in the final scenes. There is such a thing as validation.
3,the true life,"i was told by a retired agent to watch this movie to get an idea of what agents have to do! it is ok, kinda sudden ending"
5,Tess has the power!,"I hadn't heard of Guarding Tess until i found it in my parents movie collection. I was maybe eleven at the time and only picked it out because it had my nickname, Tess, in the title. Since then i have become a N. Cage lover. So i brought the movie because i forgot what it was about.(i just remember i liked it). The only reason why i say this is because by reading the other reviews, it hasnt been teens buying this movie which is a shame. You could really feel Cages emotions through the screen and Cages and Maclaine has a relationship that was pleasant to watch since you don't really see that kind of loyality anymore. And how couldn't you love the ridiculously bossy widow who everyone is afraid to say no too. Which is always a great element of a good comedy."
3,okay,okay movie i liked it but i like nicholas cage's comedy and action movies better but nicholas cage delivers a wonderful performance also i met nick cage in new york a couple of years back he's a super nice guy
5,Shirley and Nicholas good combo,"Shirley MacLaine once again shows her versatility as an actress as Tess, the wife of a Late President still receiving government protection. Nicholas Cage as Special Agent in Charge Doug Chesney, of her protection unit begins his relationship with Tess on a bit of a cantankerous note, you are drawn into the movie. When the President calls Doug rises to the task. When Tess is kidnapped, Doug and his team take the steps necessary to find her, even when the odds are against them. You'll laugh, cry and see two strong willed people overcome life's adversities. A must have in your family collection."
5,Must Have Movie!,"Maclaine and Cage, love them together. If you don't have this one, buy it! Very good Movie."
3,NOT Spring Assisted,I would certainly recommend the Icon model over this one. Not a bad knife but certainly not as well designed as others offered by Gerber.
2,Gerber's Product Quality Has Declined,"I bought this knife exactly 6 months ago; which means that after shipping and handling, I have had this knife for a couple days less than 6 months, but the screws on the side of the knife have come undone and the siding of the knife has fallen off, along with the two screws that were holding it in; they aren't regular screws, so I'm forced to now pay shipping to Gerber for a knife, which I have owned for less than 6 months, so that they can take it and screw the screws back into it... I have no doubt this will be a recurring event, might as well just throw it away. This isn't the first Gerber knife I've had this problem with, their paraframe II did the same exact thing, but with that knife the damage from losing screws was far worse since it was a paraframe. I use to recommend Gerber, but I'm afraid I can't any longer."
5,Great casual carry knife,"I chose this knife as a birthday present for myself and I love it. I've had other Gerbers before but they were usually fairly small and felt awkward in my hands if I had to use any kind of force or pressure to cut something. The Torch II Tanto feels good in my hands. Like the other reviewer said, it is heavy but I'd rather say that it's just big boned.The finger flip opening/finger guard works very well. This was my first knife with that type of opening as an option and it took a day or two to get used to it but now I can flip it open just as fast as a knife with assisted opening. The finger guard is just a big plus.The blade isn't as sharp as I expected a Gerber blade to be but it is still very sharp and cuts very well. Overall a great knife that I carry with me everywhere but to work."
4,Good daily carry knife.,"I have carried this knife for a few years as a daily utility blade. The opening mechanism is efficient, and the blade adequately sharp with good edge retention. The retention clip does well at retaining the knife in a pocket or similar, and went through three years of daily carry and moderate use before the clip screws loosened (once loosened, however, they were fully unscrewed and lost within 48 hours). The knife is still my daily carry blade, and will be a little more comfortable once I reattach the retention clip."
3,Didn't fit,It shipped quickly and arrived in 3 days. However...it turned out not to be the one I needed as it is very inflexible. I ended up buying a different Danco overflow gasket (flexible and adaptable) at Home Depot.
3,"Lacking quality, but a good cheap shoe!","The quality on this shoe leaves much to be desired (I could see the glue and spaces where the base was put onto the shoe), but it's a decent shoe for occasional wear. Do NOT buy at fully price, as you will be disappointed if you pay that much - I bought both the tan and blue when they were $12 and I'm glad I didn't pay more than that."
1,Don't Waste your Time or $$$,"I have used the old Version Videowave 5. I made several productions with it and burned them on to a DVD. There were some problems, but not many, and the DVD's worked. I upgraded to Videowave 7 thinking it would work just as well.Well, Videowave 7 has many nice features, and in some ways is easer to use than Videowave 5. However, the program is loaded with bugs or bad code. It just does not work correctly. Support for this program is worthless.So, save your time and $$ and buy something else."
1,It is sad,"Videowave 7 is an extremly difficult program to use.The company appears to be deceptive in its marketing by leading a customer to believe that they can be contacted by e-mail with help questions. When a question is sent to the company they send back a form response to look at there website.The program that is supposed to help you learn is beyond difficult. It makes no sense and tells very little.They also pretend to have a video training program that comes to assist the customer. This tells almost nothing and just stops.I was going to contact the company but I am sure they are well aware. How could they not be? Someone that they know must have tried to use the program.Their success in sales may have more to do with customers thinking that they alone are having such a difficult time.If you would like an experience in frustration have fun.David Morris, Ph.D.Professor of Marketing"
1,Videowave 7 - Not Responding - NO SUPPORT,"The program seemed to work fine for a while, but the more I used it, I began having problems with the program not responding. The more I used it, the more this problem occurred, and now I am not able to even open a file with it, while several other similar programs I have (not made by roxio) work just fine. Uninstalls, and reinstalls do not help. Whatsmore, the support from roxio, works as well as the program, which is not at all. The program is absolutely useless to me, and roxio could care less. Buyer BEWARE!"
1,"After trouble-free year, AUDIO PROBLEMS!","I thought this was a dream program, and it woked well for about a year. But for the last two videos I have shot, the audio has been anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds out of sync with the video. Extremely frustrating, and I have not made any progree fixing it. I'd buy something else."
1,Her books were plagiarized,This author was accused of plagiarizing all of her books and they were removed from publication. I thought they were good until I found that out.
5,Love it,None of the spin off's have ever captured the chemistry of this one. Every episode is a treat even if you're not into cars.
4,Typical From The Trio,"A clever compilation of winter-related stunts from this infamous trio delivers the typically high entertainment value for which this series is known. Die-hard fans of the show may find that these two episodes come up a bit flat in terms of the outrageousness of what's attempted, but the tried-and-true ""What would happen if we...?"" formula works like a charm as always."
4,Only starred the Hamster,"Great content and being able to see TopGear, my favorite television series alongside the Bond franchise was great. The only thing that could have been better was if Clarkson, May, and The Stig would have shown up."
5,Cute for summer,I have used these once for pineapple upside down cakes it was easy to use and baked up some good mini cakes.
5,Upside Down Pineapple Mini Cake Pan,"Awesome pan, very heavy, great quality! The cakes slide out easily with just a little Pam prepping. No need to grease them. We made 50 cakes for a Tiki themed baby shower that we threw. With all that practice, we found that if you fill it a little fuller than the instructions say you will get a better result. We also added more sugar and butter than recommended.The cakes were a hit and everyone got a kick out of them actually being in the shape of a pineapple. Very original. I am so glad I bought this pan....I really wish I would have bought two!BUY THIS PAN...you won't regret it."
4,Yum!,"Ok, so I ordered one of these pans and it came scratched. I was sent a new one and that one was scratched too.It seemed as though they were damaged during the making of this product, because the scratches were underneth the cast iron coating or whatever its finished with.I figured thaat they were all probably like that so I decided to just keep it.For the price, I wish it were a little better made. However, it hasnt effected the use in anyway.Other than that, these make the CUTEST mini pinapple upside down cakse!I buy pineapple cake mix in a box and use that as the main cake. I melt butter and put it at the bottom of the pan along with brown sugar. I put a pineapple ring on the bottom and then ad a marachino cherry in the center of the pineapple ring and then pour the cake batter on top and cook. These are so good and my kids just LOVE them."
5,Original post: Vocals missing.,"The product is in great condition, the vocals have been found :) haha (see original post below).I love The Electrics' music and this is another great CD :)Sorry for any confusion about the original post!Original Post: The vocals are very hard to hear over the instrumental part. It may only be my copy of the CD, but it was quite disappointing to get my CD in the mail and not be able to hear the words to the music...if they exist?"
1,Not worth the $400,"I was delighted to find such a great deal on diamond earrings, and I read the so-so review on here but bought them anyway. I was mortified when I opened the box and saw a big black inclusion in the diamond so big that you could see it from several feet away. Who would dare sell something so awful?! I thought about exchanging it for a fresh pair, but I was so pissed at the low quality that I returned them for a full refund. Fortunately they refunded my money right away, although I'm still upset that they wanted $400 for these, and with an original price of well over $1000! WTF?"
5,Steve Mcqueen's best movie,"This was originally aired in the 1950's in the TV anthology series Studio One. I didn't see it when it was originally aired but I did see it on the TV channel TV Land. I thought is was fabulous. The best TV movie, and courtroom drama ever."
4,For me it was the best of the genre,"First of all I appologize for my writing, 'cause I'm not a native English speaker.I became very interested with Arthurian literature and with the Quest. I've read many books, and this is the one I have liked best. This book is the full version of the quest that Thomas Mallory included in his book La Morte d'Arthur. So the storyline is somewhat different than it's near predecessors Chretien de Troyes and W. Von Eschenbach. I find this one the deepest in terms of symbolism, and the most valuable one.For those who would like to go a bit back in time to Merlin's origin, the beginning of King Arthur, etc, you can find that in the book from Robert de Boron."
5,Poetic and Beautiful,"The cycle of 'grail romance' from which this book comes from was unfairly slammed by the late Joseph Campbell to millions of people. Comparing it to Eschenbach is like comparing Spenser to Shakespeare. Yes, von Eschenbach's PARZIVAL is the greater work (and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in these worlds), but the QUEST OF THE HOLY GRAIL is a jewel in its own right. It's a book that radiates light. The influences and impressions one receives from a book like this should not be passed up. They won't make you rich or satisfy your sexual desire, but they will help to build your spiritual body. Did you know you have a spiritual body?"
4,Book is Excellent,"This book has really excellent content. It is large (like a coffee table book). The book I purchased was in overall good condition but had something spilt across the top edge and down the front of it. I spent some time cleaning it off and it came off easily enough, but I wondered why it would be delivered like this instead of cleaned off prior to shippingl"
4,Complete Book of World War II Combat Aircraft,This book was more than I expected. Very detailed in every aspect. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this subject.
1,regulator,i bought the part i got it and it doesnt work i have emailded the company very very poor service i call like 50 times all i get is an aswering machie that says they are bussy helping other customers i have sent several emails no response i dont think amazon should let them sell on their web page
1,Incorrect part,Use caution when buying this part. Went to go replace the motor and found that the track system on the 2000 grand prix I was working on had a completely different design from what was shipped. Had to return part. Refund issued. Take a look at your door and make sure you have a single track design like what is picture here before you buy. I had a twin track design that was incompatible. Ended up buying the motor from a local parts store for $2 more.
3,Bent,I installed the product but my window struggle rolling all the way up. I had to take apart my door again and after playing with it for a while found that the top portion was bent. So when it got close to the top it wasn't a smooth straight track anymore. I had to leave one of the screws out just to get it to kind of work.
2,There Are Better Choices,"This collection is from the early Aussie years. Its cheap and is not remastered. If you want quality, I would suggest, ""Brilliant From Birth"" or ""Birth Of Brilliance"" for quality and many more songs."
3,Why not better,"This album seemed that it wasnt well remastered. But if you want to listen to the Bee Gees's earliest Australia's hit song (or maybe they think so), this is a great collection.Quite cheap too!"
1,Over-rated,"Skocpol's ""comparative analysis"" leaves out only one minor detail: people. It seems never to occur to her that social revolutions are ultimately the consequence of human agency--that is, people taking history into their own hands. Marx's famous dictum from the opening of the ""Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napolean"" that ""men make their own history, but they do not make it exactly as they choose,"" is lost on Skocpol. Rather, such phenomena as socio-economic classes, states, political institutions, etc., exist for her as if they were variables in Euclidian geometry. By comparison, Stalin could pass for Kant, if not Hegel, and Althusser might as well be Lukacs. If you care about this subject, look to Barrington Moore, Jr., E. P. Thompson, and more recent studies of each ofthe three revolutions Skocpol compares."
4,"So tiny, but what big cabezas!!!","I liked this game,and I don't even own a DS yet! Movie tie-ins are a fun waste of time and money, and this game is no exception! I bought this cart on sale, borrowed a DS and had a blast. The mini-games are movie related and hilarious. Earphones are a must. Playing with others wirelessly (up to 4 at a TIME) will make you giggle out loud. The art style reminds all of the wonders of supermarionation. The big heads and little bodies make me think of either Liddle Kiddles or Thunderbirds. I think if you liked the film, this will be an easy choice for you."
3,"Fun, but too short...","Okay, so I got this game yesterday, and beat it within 20 minutes, but other than the short length, this is a really impressive game.The game actually does a pretty good job at following the movies plot (When compared to other movie-based games), and the best part is that (like movie games for the Playstation) a lot of the cutscenes are actual clips from the movie (And even if you hated the movie, you have to admit that that's very impressive for the DS).The gameplay is made up of minigames (which most of them are pretty good), and cartoon-style wreslting (for example: Ripping off people's body parts and squishing them) although it's pretty easy to win.In the end, I'd say if you liked the movie, there's a pretty good chance you'll like this. But if you didn't like the movie, then why are you even reading reviews for the game?"
3,"Seem to work fine, but try to send different colors.","The toothbrushes themselves seem to do the trick, so no complaints there.I like the fact they have replaceable batteries, but the heads aren't (which is like the sonicare, except you can buy heads but not replace the battery). No one seems to be interested in making a toothbrush where you can make the hardware itself last. Such a shame.I was disappointed to get two of the same color. Not a great thing when you have two kids. I slapped a sticker on one to distinguish it from the other. Even if I was getting a 2-pack for one kid, just having two separate colors wouldn't hurt."
3,Great idea but died after 10 days,"We got it at a store for our 7 year old. The buttons are soft and easy to use. Overall it worked great until the batteries started slowing down...We tried to change them and none of the new ones worked. So, I guess, some water got in, or maybe it's just a short life brush."
2,Not what I ordered,"I am giving this two stars because what I received is not what is pictured here. My daughter picked this one because she likes the color blue and she likes Gary on it. What Amazon sent me was an orange one with only Spongebob. It took a lot of coaxing to get her to use it. Other than the color of the toothbrush, it works great."
4,I fell in love when I heard her voice!,"I saw a clip of P.P. Arnold's version of ""The First Cut is the Deepest"" on Youtube and I had to hear more. She has as much soul in her voice as early Aretha, though a little less polished.Lots of cover songs here, but P.P. does her own thing with them. In most cases that's good, but I didn't think ""Eleanor Rigby"" suited her.My favorite cut is #5, ""The Time Has Come."" It just hits me.All that, and she was cute as a button in the 60s! (And if you go to her website today, she still looks good.)"
3,"Great singer, poor sound recording","Fabulous voice, great style - her version of First Cut Is The Deepest is the best I've ever heard. Unfortunately, the erratic editing and overall poor sound quality just trumps the performance of a fine vocal artist. I wouldn't buy this disc again."
5,Simply great,I had used this book in spring 2000 . I was quite impressed by the detailed explanation this book cover. It was for the first time that I was using Excel for statistic class. This book cover various functions of statistics in such easy and simple manner that I was thrilled to see my own performance with Excel .I would recommand this book for any student want to learn business Stats using Excel.
4,Great Macro and Add-in Resource,"This book is gold if you want to write macros or add-ins for Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003. It starts with the basics for writing macros in Visual BASIC .NET and gradually leads to writing full-blown add-ins in C#.My only complaint of this book is that it seems to lean rather heavily towards VB.NET and most of the examples are in VB.NET unless they absolutely have to be shown in C#. For example, when covering features that you really would only want to do in an add-in, the code snippets showing how to carryout certain tasks are shown in VB.NET. Converting from VB.NET to C# isn't too hard for a veteran programmer, but there are some pitfalls that can be time consuming.But all in all, a great resource if you want to unleash the full power of Visual Studio via macros or add-ins."
3,Title is misleading,"The title of this book should have been "".NET Add-in's and Macros"" instead of ""Inside Visual Studio .NET"". I wonder how many people have been misled thinking they were getting a book on how to use the IDE. In fact the first few chapters seem to indicate this confusingly!"
4,Cop This Ghost,"I liked 100 Feet, I found it entertaining as a woman who is under house arrest finds that the past really does come back to haunt you. Famke Janssen is a pretty good actress and plays the battered wife, now victim, now fighting back, very well.I liked also how the film builds and doesn't show all its cards too soon as it ropes you in to a real showdown.Ok so this is no academy award winner to be sure and they seem to be pumping out films of this ilk every other week, what is different here however is it's not just about haunting or revenge, it's about survival, even under the most supernatural encounters.As far as ghost films go, this is not a bad effort, not a bad effort at all."
3,100 Feet,"A woman kills her husband in self defense, goes to jail, but she gets beat up (something you'll hear about long into the movie), and she is put under house arrest. Her husband was a cop and his partner is the one who puts her under house arrest. He hates her but she says she called him several times about the abuse and out of the blue toward the end, he believes her. Anyways, she starts to see her husbands ghost as he attacks her. The lovely Famke Janssen puts on a very good performance but the story has several plot holes that makes you ask why. She is given 100 feet to move about but she clearly goes past the that several times in the movie and the ending was quite stupid. I think this was a very enjoyable film if you can suspend your mind for 90 minutes."
2,Had so much potential,"This movie started off on a really strong note which is maintained through much of the film. I had been prepared to give it four stars. However, the ending ruined it all. The action sequences and haunting were well-done, especially when Mikey beats up Marnie's current lover, but the ending was just so cliche and sloppily done. I just did not buy the way Mikey was defeated, it was utterly anti-climatic, and this movie ended up disappointing me gravely, which is sad since it started off so well."
3,eh ...,"This is okay. It starts out a lot better than it actually delivers by the end. Acting is actually pretty good throughout, but the FX were just annoying. Premise is a great one. With a tighter script, better fx, and a better ending, this could have worked really well. Not bad for a spin though."
3,suspense filled,Not something for the kids to watch. Lots of blood and gore with a pinch of suspense to get your panties all in a bunch. When you think its over its not.
3,Ghost stories................,"Her husband beats her and does so continuously until she reacts by stabbing him repeatedly in self defense for her life. Just released from prison and under house arrest, she is trying to pick up her life again. However, the ghost of her dead husband will not leave her in peace. This movie is classified as a horror movie. It has good action and is very intense. It stars Famke Jannsen as the battered wife. One classic love scene and then the ghost attacks and gruesomely destroys the male partner. Blood flows and the wife has panic attacks while trying to escape. This movie wasn't bad. I thought it was okay and good enough for 90 minutes of fun. I would not recommend to children because of the adult content. For adults, 3 stars. And then, there is this classic:The Mystery of Edwin Drood (Thrift Edition)"
2,1000 Feet,"I'm not sure why this movie got such high ratings. The story was stupid, simplistic and very predictable. The graphics, however, were ridiculously crude and contemptuous; a cartoon for horror effects, how bland and stupid do they think we are?The actor playing her dead husband's dumb cop of a partner (Bobby Cannavale) looks the part, as he's a stupid idiot.The movie had potential but as it goes on and on, the story goes into the toilet.Of course, the ending left me with a ""I'm going to puke"" impression."
5,Just plain moving and rewarding,"Somehow, despite a realistic story about hard-bitten people, this first novel is also sweet, moving, and not depressing. Maybe it's because the characters, despite their faults, have character. It's on a par with the best novels about life in the United States (in this case a small town in Pennsylvania) that I've ever read. It passes an ultimate test: I'd readily lend it to anyone. My father liked it, too."
3,Psych reports,"A fairly introductory text that proposes a common model of psychological report writing for most health related purposes. Don't feel it goes beyond the ""essentials"" series or most general psychology texts, and little coverage of forensic or neuropsychology settings."
4,Excellent,This book is an excellent introduction and guide to writing psychological reports in practice. well written containing practical information in a clear and concise manner. Recommended.
3,look for newer edition,"There is a newer edition I was looking for. I believe it is 1998 give or take a year. I borrowed a colleague's and was impressed, especially with the suggestions for writing and organized personality section of a report."
3,Oh well!,"Great Illustrations but unfortunetly the text is not its equal. For the amount of money that it cost me, I was disappointed. You are better off buying Peter Brown's ""The World of Late Antiquity""which is light years away from this."
3,Not quite what it seems,"This is an odd book that gives the appearance of being a general reference, but in fact it is just a collection of essays in two parts: longer articles such as ""Religious Communities"" and ""War and Violence"", and an alphabetic section of short articles on a wide variety of topics. This second part is maddeningly arbitrary: three columns on the Himyar tribe, for example, but no entry for the Alans. Entries for people are particularly spotty, with the emphasis on religious rather than secular figures. Anyone looking for a late-antique version of the Oxford Classical Dictionary will be disappointed. Nonetheless there is a wealth of information here, covering a wide variety of subjects. The scope includes the growth of Islam, which is well represented in both sections.NOTE: The long essays in this book have been published separately asInterpreting Late Antiquity: Essays on the Postclassical World."
2,dissapointing,"I was very dissapointed. First, as I took them out of the box I could see how steep they were. Then, they were too small!!! I have no problem with my number in other shoe brands, but I would easily need a full extra number to fit into this."
4,Stories that make you want to live it up,"One of Mary Troy's sympathetic and world-weary characters says near the end of the book that understanding your luck in being alive makes you ""want to live it up."" So does this collection of stories set in St. Louis. Though many of her characters are lonely, confused or down-at-the-heels, Troy portrays them full-on, with their own humor and grace to console us in the reading. To write simply is like hitting the bullseye--it's always harder than it looks, and Troy shoots for the targets of Welty, early Faulkner and even Chekhov. Buy and enjoy."
1,assembly instructions are useless,"The photographs in the manual are poor quality. It seemed that the provided tools were not needed, but that can't be right. Can't widen the base. The instructions often don't match the actual product. No instructions or photographs regarding how to use the sling. This might be a good product, but I still haven't figured out how to safely use it. BTW, I have a Masters in Manufacturing Engineering."
2,Only the cover item is cute,"None of the knitting projects, besides the one on the cover, are very cute. Don't buy the book. You can buy the individual patterns through Elann, and pick the patterns you like, rather than have a book full of projects you'll never want to make."
3,Just OK,There are a few designs I may make in this book. I personally don't like the rest at all - gaudy and impractical. I also think they will become dated quickly.
2,Live @ the Marquee,"It is a neverending search to try to find good quality recordings of early Peter Green and this is not the end of that search. The sound quality is fair, at best, and Green stays in the background too much for my taste. This maybe due to Danny Kirwan not being on this one, leaving too much Jeremy Spencer. I am glad I have this recording though as Mean Woman Blues is GREAT despite the sound quality. Green is dynamite at the end of it. So far, I still think you're better off with the Live at the Boston Tea Party discs."
2,terrible sound quality,"I have a ""Collector's Gold"" disc of this recording. What a joke. Putting out an absolutely terrible recording on a gold disc. The performances might be very good but it is too hard to tell with sound quality as bad as this. Probably was recorded with a mic in someone's pocket."
2,For Completists Only,"When one is shopping for arhival music, one has to balance sound quality with performance quality (one assumes you already have a passion for the artist...). Not including the rockabilly throwback Green and Spencer loved to perform, there are a little over 250 officially released unique Fleetwood Mac w/ Peter Green tracks available off and on in the market place. This recording is for the completist only - while the performance is a rare glimpse of the very first formal incarnation of Fleetwood Mac (Bob Brunning on bass, not John McVie), and a view into the famed Marquee club atmosphere, the sound quality is at the bottom of the aforementioned 250+ tracks one can collect. BTW, while Green would always play backup to Spencer, the reverse was rarely true. Much Peter Green listening requires attention to subtleties."
1,Not what I expected,"The diamonds were quite yellow, so much that I debated whether to give them to my wife, and she visibly debated taking them. I don't think I'll buy jewelry from Amazon again, just because I have no way to see what I'm getting until the day it arrives."
2,Not worth the price,"First set came in with a diamond loose, so you know the setting isn't that great. Second set came with much lower quality stones than the first. Returned for refund, and went elswhere. For about $40 more I was able to pick up much better quality and clarity. I can not say enough good things about the customer service at Amazon on this item though. Not one commment or critque of my taste or of my decision. I would shop Amazon again but look for higher quality."
2,"large carbon spot on one earring, perfect on the other",One of the earrings had a very large carbon spot just under the surface of the top of the stone. Visible from 20 feet away on a 3/8 of a carrot stud.
2,Worked well for 6 months,"My Netgear FA120 worked well for 6 months, until the circuit board fried. I gave it a 2 because of its large size and detachable (easy to lose) usb cable, plus it failed when I needed it the most. I prefer usb adaptors as a temporary solution only, if possible go with the PCI type."
5,Works with Tivo!,"Had no problem networking our two Tivos with these adapters. Transfer isn't as fast as we would have hoped, but I think using the wired network is still faster than a wireless."
5,It DOES work with TiVo,"I just got this with a Netgear WGE101NA to wirelessly connect a new TiVo to my home netowrk, and it worked without a hitch. My router is im my basement and the master bedroom on the third floor still gets between 65-75% signal strength. Very happy with this product for how I'm using it."
5,"Masterpieces of Style, Elegance And Beauty","One of the greatest pleasures of music is listening to it with someone special who shares your musical tastes and at the same time appreciating the beauty and charms music has to offer, like for instance, this lovely album ""Moon Beams"" from Bill Evans Trio. It consists of some of Bill Evans greatest recordings with Chuck Israels on bass and Paul Motian on drums.""Less is more"" applies to this album of eight remarkable tunes, two of which are his very own compositions, ""Re: Person I Knew"" and ""Very Early."" My favorites include ""Polka Dots And Moonbeams,"" ""It Might As Well Be Spring,"" and ""Stairway To The Stars."" These are masterpieces of style, elegance and beauty.Listening to this lovely album creates an atmosphere of coziness and you'll surely fall in love with Bill Evans' tastefully exquisite piano playing style.With my heartfelt recommendation for your listening pleasure always and ever!"
5,Pure genius.,"This is a great album. If you can get it on vinyl as I did, do so and relax to the incredible music of Bill Evans and his Trio. This album is in my top 10 Jazz albums of all time. Enjoy."
3,funny,I think this book was a funny book with the dog trying to play all sorts of instruments.Michigan
2,Book was a somewhat beat up..,This book arrived and I was somewhat disappointed because it was somewhat beat up. I do not normally have this problem when I buy from Amazon.
3,Nonviolent Insistence,"the best way to resist trashing the planet is for many people to radically change their lifestyles. the sustainable new can arise amid the dying fossil-fuel technology, but only if people have a clear picture of where they are going. for pictures, check out[...]we can achieve comfortable sustainability, if we can avoid sentimentality and many other traps."
1,If your gums are sensitive...............stay away from this one!,"I bought the ""soft"" bristle toothbrush and I can't tell you what torture it was for my gums. The head of the brush is very wide therefor making it more of a brush to your gums than to your teeth. The outter bristles stick our further than the bristles on the inside that would get to your teeth, therefore making the brush useless to your teeth. Feels like you haven't brushed yet. That's my opinion, for what it's worth, and I hope it helps you."
2,"Nothing but clever marketing, again.","This new brush is just silly. It works just like every other brush I've owned in the past 30 years. There's nothing new here, its just a re-invented re-invention of the same old thing, again. The new twist is the tongue cleaner which feels like (and works not quite as well as) a tab of velcro (it scrapes the insides of your cheeks). I don't think any real people actually tested this brush, but then again, who'd buy it if it didn't look like a revolution in brushing technology? It may work well for cleaning road grime off of car wheels."
5,Nice tie - quality product,Ordered a solid white tie for my gangster halloween outfit. I wanted one I could use later for a formal occasion if I needed to. The tie was high quality and looked very nice.
2,Like it :),I was actually meaning to buy a skinny tie considering the description said it was a skinny tie but no surprise that was a lie but I use it whenever it's needed which is not often.
5,Looks Good,I wore this very nice white tie with a dark blue dress shirt and black slacks. Needless to say it looked very nice.Recommend.
1,ARE U CRAZY!!,These other reviewers must be fools. THIS TIE IS GARBAGE!!!! u can go to century 21 and get an amazing tie for $2 less. I bought this tie bc i didnt have time to go shoppin and when it arrvied i was in SHOCK!!!! its Material is ugly and looks like a 6 year olds TIE!!! i am embarrased to wear this tie anywhere!!!!! AWFULL!!!!
1,Not as advertised,"The production description stated the tie was ""3 and 7/8 inches wide at the bottom"". The tie I received was 3 inches wide."
4,White Tie,The item arrived on time and intact. It looks the same as the image when I bought it; no problem with the seller. The only issue that I have is its start to break apart after a few weeks of wearing and I wear it two times a week; my other ties that I own for many months is still in great condition. I would rated it 5 but its too fragile for me.
3,White Tie,"The tie was a good value for the price. The only issue was an ink pen mark on the tie, and the fact it looked a little cheaper then a similar $55 dollar tie I ended up buying. But for $6 I guess that makes sense. Thanks."
5,A Fun and Refreshing Read !!,"This book was such a fun read. Even if you are not involved in metaphysics there is much to be enjoyed here. More than once I laughed until I cried. I found the characters very believable and the situations (for those of us involved in metaphysics) to be realistic. Although this book is fun, there are also object lessons not unlike those we have all experienced in our own lives. I really like Anne. She is a delightful character who has embarked on an adventure beyond her wildest imaginings and whose life will never be the same again. To relate to her and her situations was very easy. Go with the flow, follow intuition and know that all the right people will be in the right place at the right time, even if it doesn't seem like it at first. For those who are interested in reading a lighthearted metaphysical journey I strongly recommend this book."
4,Buy this album,"If you are an indie rock fan, like myself, you will love Sushirobo's latest CD. This one does not have those annoying guitar solos and the boredom of other popular indie rock albums. This one is not self-absorbed and full of ""feelings."" Also it does not have all those experimental sounds that come from a 14-year-olds laptop. In addition, this is a great album for dancing. The sounds are very clear and focus on minimalism, which is nice after a long day."
1,Don't waste your money,"Save your money! Keep the bags from your grocer for free, and throw the poop in the trash. The Doggie Dooley doesn't work six months out of the year because of the cold (of course the company doesn't tell you this until you've bought it). When it does work, it does so poorly. It is a complete pain to maintain. The flimsy plastic on mine broke before the year was up where the lid hinge is. If you want to waste your money, just set it on fire."
5,Rod was God,"I haven't even watched this yet but I know, psychically, that it rocks. Just that opening theme alone conjures up messed up childhood memories of the scariest TV theme ever. Serling apparently wasn't happy with this series, and others have said similarly, that it wasn't up to Twilight Zone standards, but it has its own 70s twisted appeal. Also, his wave of massive hair during the spoken intro is a wonder in its own right. God Bless Rod."
5,Great Set of Episodes,Loved the Twilight Zone and loved this show just as much. This is highly recommended for any fan of Rod Sterling! It is on equal standings with the Twilight Zone and sometimes you may find yourself enjoying it more so than it.
5,excellent show,If you want a quality supernatural show with great actors eg vincent price and with well thought out stories and a great set-up in a art gallery- just buy it you'll not be dissapointed.
1,Paramount is the pits,"Great show, but as is the case with many Universal/Paramount releases, they simply stop releasing DVD's after a few seasons if they think that the show isn't selling well enough: Even if the low sales are because of splitting seasons into volumes and ultimately charging twice as much per season. They are notorious for ending the release of a series after a season or two. Some real geniuses working there. I'm now stuck with partial runs of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Night Gallery, Cannon, etc... If you like to collect full runs of classic TV shows like I do, it's almost better not to buy the first seasons from Universal/Paramount in the first place. They're the the worst, and obviously couldn't care less about their customers."
2,Not so good,There are only about five good episodes in this entire season. sadly it's nowhere as good as the twilight zone despite serling's efforts. dont trust the hype on this one.
2,"Nothing to see here, move along...","Night Gallery holds a special place in alot of hearts. I am one of those people. I adored season 1 and could not wait for season 2 mainly for the Lovecraft tales which I had never seen.With that being said there are some true gems in this collection. ""The boy who predicted earthquakes"" comes to mind and various others.Now with the praise out of the way, on to the problem.Sadly I found myself getting more entertainment out of the EC Archives I was reading while the dvd was playing. Most of the stories or ""paintings"" are some of the most guessable, contrived muck ever put to film. Nothing shocked, surprised, or even amused me 89% of the entire season. Even most of the funny 5-10 minute ones fell flat in a big way.On top of this was the picture and sound. Watchable but nothing to be awe-inspired about. Sound was decent at best.To finish there are some true classics in this season, but the rest drowns it all in obscurity for good reason."
5,Excellent DVD set from the TV series !,The second part is as good as the first one. Don't miss it if you love this classic TV series of the 70's. I was expecting since many time ago for the famous story about the boy who predicted earthquakes and now I have it !
5,strange,i use to love the twilight zone when i discovered this i couldn't believe eyes and hear it as good as. thanks
5,Love this series,"Finally all three seasons are available. And well worth the wait. The transfer was clean, sound good etc... The only thing about Night Gallery, is there either ""really really good... Or there stupid""... The episodes would include, generally, one or two longer segments, and a ""short"" story (about five or ten minutes long, depending on how much time they were trying to fill."
1,Defective Discs Ruin Viewing Experience,"My complaint is with the defective discs in this set. Several episodes won't play and are automatically skipped over. Most notably on disc one, episode 3.1 ""Since Aunt Ada Came to Stay"" and episode 4.1 ""A Fear Of Spiders"". Several other episodes won't play either. When I became aware of this it was too late to return the Box Set to Amazon; they only allow a month to return items. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,Night Gallery Season Two is Great!!!,"I have just purchased Night Gallery Season Two, and all I can say is that it is fantastic! The stories are very enjoyable to watch just like the first season. The stories here seem much more spookier and creepy. Plus, the box art looks great too! If you haven't purchased this set yet, you should go out and get it. I can't wait for the release of Night Gallery Season Three."
3,just alright,This was ok not as good as I was hoping. I felt like she kind of liked to hear herself talk.
2,Not for me,"The drumming on this CD is just WAY too fast. I've experienced much slower drumming, which is more hypnotic, a much quicker trip to that relaxed state that we need to journey. The speed of this drumming is so hyper that there's no hope to slow down your thoughts or allow a calm centering. If I had been able to listen to a bit of it before I purchased it, I never would have wasted my money."
4,A BIT TOO BASIC FOR ME,"Must of the recording seem to be a loop of the same, but the sound quality is good. Helpful to people new to the subject."
4,Sacred Drums (for the Shamanic Journey,Excellent tape for Journey work. Love the single drumming for a short journey. Call back is nice. Recommended to apprentice.
4,Great!,Great! I love buying my books on here! So far they have been exactly as described. Heres to more books!
5,Excellent,"Purchased this used book for my law class at UOP. The book arrived in excellent condition, in less than a week so I was able to take it the first night of class!"
5,Information galore,"I am in my last year of a Bachelor degree in Business and Marketing and really appreciated the fine condition of this book, it is full of information on the business world and I would recommend it to all students. I enjoy ordering from the Amazon.com website as I always have a choice of new or used books that are in very good condition, also I can resell my purchases when I am through with them, now how great is that!"
3,Over View,The book presents an overview of the issues facing business. A text book for U.O.P. business law class as of this review. It is biased to the left in political view. It promotes the Democrat Party story of racism in America while ignoring the whole history of America's greatness in equality of opportunity. It plays down the Constitution while promoting social change through court rulings. It fails to give conservative or libertarian points of view in law. The made up examples are very simple. The actual examples are also very simple.
3,Too many typos,"I like this book but, as I'm reading and studying it for my business law class, I'm perturbed to be running across too many misspelled words. The text itself is excellent, well presented and easy to comprehend. The typos, however, detract from the quality of the book, hence the three star review. Maybe an editor will make the necessary corrections before a new edition is published."
1,Tried to get twice,"Tried twice to get this book. Both times the sellers sent me the wrong book, should be easy with ISBN numbers. I gave up."
3,Repeated routines,"I might have enjoyed Brian's routines better if I had not already seen most of them on David Letterman. I guess to promote this tour/dvd, he featured his jokes on late night shows. Apparently, the routines he chose to do on David Letterman were the best parts, and was all i needed to see really. If i known this, i would not have bougtht this dvd. However, Brian's one of my favorite comedians and thought i should have one of this acts to keep on my shelf, even though i probably wont watch it again."
1,Love Brian but this is a DUD,"We are big fans, on his specail pre-buy anything you come out with list on the fan website. Just watched 'Standing Up' - it's a dud. I'd pass if I were you.I'd measure it by saying its less than half of a new set of material."
1,Lame,Its pathetic this guy even has a special. Everyone seems to like him because he's clean but can't you be clean and funny at the same time? I guess not. The only reason my friends and I laughed was because he was so bad. I was so embarrassed for this guy it made me feel uncomfortable the whole time. I felt bad for the people who payed money for his show or even this DVD. I wish I could remove this DVD from amazon to save people from having to sit through one of the least entertaining hours of their life. I hope another clean comedian that is actually funny comes around so people can compare and realize that he needs to retire his sad attempt at humor.
5,Finally - Real Talent,"Funny, funny dude. My wife is a clean comedian also, and she works very hard to get material. Most people don't realize, that comedians who aren't clean ARE REALLY NOT FUNNY, vulgarity is pretty simple to write. Cheap humour. Its just juvenile what 95% of comedians and their audiences view as humour.Mr. Reagan, please know your talent is appreciated and respected, our entire family loves Brian Regean, and I can't stop laughing whenever I hear any of his material."
5,The south florida boy delivers again!!!,"Regan delivers another great performance that is fun for the whole family! I highly recommend ""I Walked on the Moon"".....pop tarts, eye doctors and the Me-Monster....his greatest performance ever!"
4,Loved the video!,"We loved the video. Brian is a very funny guy and his comedy is "" clean '.Have seen another video of his and that's why we purchased this one.Enjoy!!"
5,The best there is . . .,"Dane Cook makes me laugh, but he also makes me send my kids to bed. Brian Regan makes me wake them up because I'm laughing so loudly, and that's okay since he's their favorite stand-up too. He's a little smart, he's a little goofy, he's a little sarcastic, it's all in there. If he doesn't make you laugh without guilt, you may be broken."
4,Extended Versions of some of their songs,"This release came after Radio Futura had just made the Top 10 in Spain in 1992. Corazon de Tiza is a great song and it was accompanied by a good video too. The extended versions and new arrangements of some of their ""standards"" are interesting and some so different from their original releases. A good buy!"
3,scratchy but ....,"These are not super soft sheets, it will probably take quite a few washes before they come close to soft, but they are thicker then most sheets in this price range and should last a good long time."
2,They feel like 100% !!,"Though these sheets are 40% polyester, they feel like they're closer to 100% plastic."
5,Outstanding,"Well written, beautifully illustrated and an informative and enjoyable read. Model railroaders, new and experienced alike, will relish in the information provided by this book. This is a quality publication and worthy of being in any model railroaders library."
3,Not as good as the others...,"I've enjoyed this author's other books in this series, but this left a lot of things unfinished or sewn up with very little mention of how.Cody's feelings against having a baby were talked about once and than they ended up with a baby.Olivia goes from wanting no one to hooking up with Merris on the second date.I don't even know what Dr. Howick and Riley were even doing in this story. There was barely any subplot on them especially the Dr.Disappointed in this one....need more drama between the characters."
2,Too good to be true.,"I was also pleased when I got my mattress. What a bargain! We had a Tempurpedic mattress for 12 years and it had developed sunken areas where we lay. So, rather than spending $1200 on a new Tempurpedic we bought the memory foam mattress. Unfortunately, after just a few months sunken areas developed in our new mattress even though we rotated the top foam piece every time we changed our sheets. I am very disappointed. Our next mattress will be a Tempurpedic!"
2,Not What They Used To Be,"I have used this type of Thorlo sock for many years. They used to last a lot longer before wearing through. Yes, I weigh a bit more than I used to but I no longer carry a 15 to 35 pound pack and I do many less miles than in the past. At this sort of price, these socks should be a whole lot more durable.If anyone has a suggestion for a replacement, some other sock that has the same function but is a better value, please leave a comment. Thanks."
3,"Thick and comfy, but they're too short (I bought the correct size)","Thick and comfy, but they're a bit too short on the foot (I'm not referring to the leg height).I'm a 8 to 8.5. I bought a medium which is supposed to fit up to a 8.5 shoe but they're a bit on the tight side which makes my toes feel crushed. If they were a bit longer, they be a 5 star sock."
2,Not very durable...,"I bought a pair of this sock in December, 2011, and both socks are riddled with huge holes. I've bought Thorlos before with much better wear. These are disappointing."
2,Harry Poofta,These are comfortable socks... I just can't get over how frayed and frazzled they became with two to three wears. They look as though I've owned them for years with all the loose fibers.For the money I suppose I expect a sharper image.
2,clumsy knife,It's not comfortable to hold or to wear. It doesn't open or close easily. Just because it's a Buck knife doesn't necessarily mean it's a good knife.
4,Not quite up to advertising hype,"This trimmer does a better than adequate job of trimming. The variable setting feature is easy to use and effective. The unit is considerably larger than most competitors, and this is a bit of a disadvantage. Also,the vacuum does not get all clippings, so count of beard trimmings on your counter, in your sink, etc.; not bad but not up to advertising. Certainly worth the price."
4,Well designed all-in-one trimmer,"I used an older version of this trimmer for years. This one was much cheaper than the original. It appears to be better constructed and with the exception of the vacuum collection tray, it is even better than the first. The previous iteration had a drawer in which the trimmings were collected. This version has a door that opens and the trimmings fall out - a little messy."
3,Gotta take the bad with the good,"Somewhat disappointed. This thing doesn't quite work as advertised.Pros:-Sharp blade gives a smooth, uniform cut with fewer strokes-Convenient adjustable dial eliminates need for different trimmer headsCons:-Vacuum is a complete joke! Very weak, only captures about half the cut hair, letting the rest just spill onto my hand and around my sink (the vacuum is the freakin' reason why I bought this thing in the first place)-Pathetic battery life: 10 HOURS of charging adds up to only 45 MINUTES of use"
3,Norelco T780 Good,"I am very happy with the value of this product. Blades remain sharp, stays charged for a very long time. Looking forward to see how it holds up in the years to come."
3,RECHARGEABLE TRIMMER,"HUSBAND WAS NOT OVERLY THRILLED WITH THIS, GOOD FOR A QUICK TOUCH UP, BUT NOT EXCELLENT. DECENT & PROBABLE GOOD FOR TRAVELING SINCE IT IS SLEEK & DOESN'T TAKE UP TOO MUCH ROOM, BUT WOULD NOT USE AS A MAIN RAZOR."
2,Rediculous packaging,"The performance of the Norelco T780 is adequate, but not as powerful as an older Norelco trimmer it replaced. I must go over my beard several time to get a uniform trim.Now, for the real complaint: The plastic packaging was ridiculous. I had to get heavy shears to break into it and risked cutting my hands on the shartp edges."
3,eco-toxic manufacturer,"I have the 770, but this issue would be common to all of these trimmers. Shaves okay. Problem: eco-unfriendly. Battery contains toxic materials and company does little to assure that people eventually dispose of it properly--Norelco officially tells you somewhere in the literature to take the trimmer to a recycling place, but by the time anyone's ready to replace the thing they won't know where the literature is telling them that, and besides, Norelco doesn't really provide any support for doing so: no address or contact info, even. Since there's little help or encouragement taking care of the battery responsibly, I'm sure most people don't. Thanks Norelco! :( Still, i'm unaware of better alternatives and would be interested to learn of any."
3,T780 is okay.,"This is about an average trimmer. The previous one I had was a Norelco and it worked better. One problem is that if you break the comb part (which is easy to do and which I did with the old one) then you have a time finding a replacement part and when you do it will cost over $15.00. Those of you who have trouble with it vacuuming properly may be holding it so that your hand is covering the vent holes in the handle. Of course this is going to make it hard to create the proper suction and air exhaust to do the vacuuming. The door for the collection chamber is a pretty flimsy device. The older one I had, had a removable chamber that was much easier to empty."
4,Not bad,"Firstly when I opened the box and looked at my new Philips Norelco T780, I could see instantly the build quality is not very good. The comb is made of cheap flimsy plastic, and the general appearance of the trimmer looks very basic, big, almost 1980's in design, and in a way, amateur.However, when I went to use it, the trimmer worked well, and as I have not used a vacuum trimmer before, I was very impressed by this feature. I hadn't liked previous trimmers which left hair all over the sink, and I liked the Norelco T780 was able to retain about 90% of the hair. For this reason I give it 4 stars.Overall the Philips Norelco T780 has a very cheap build quality, but it does the job of trimming well, and the vacuum does a good job of retaining most of the hair. If you drop it on a hard floor from a reasonable height, the flimsy plastic comb is likely to break. but if you are careful with it, it may last you a few years."
2,Not quite the best thing after sliced bread...,"I bought the Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer because one of their earlier, humbler trimmer was great...I used that for about 8 years (4 in India) before I simply misplaced it...so needing a new one.But this new one is rather wimpy in function...especially on a good length beard...and the vacuum is largely cosmetic."
4,satisfied,"Works fine for me I have had maybe 5 norelco trimmers in the past, this one by far is the fastest one I have owned, cuts even,and like all the other ones, I've had, it would probably slip to a lower setting if too much pressure was applied but I figure it is my face why do I want to bush hog it, so I have always used slight pressure using a trimmer, vacuum does a decent job (clean the filter screen each use), especially if you use it everyday, my old one was broken and I was waiting for this one so my beard got a little longer than normal, the vacuum left some clippings on the sink, it didn't do as well as it did using it the 2nd time ,I didn't see any lil clippings after the 2nd trimming on the sink a few on my chest though I like the lil door that slides out so it will pickup the clippings when you pop the beard trimmer off and use the mustache trimmer I like the size my old one was too small for big hands to hold securely this one fits my hand"
5,No complaints,"Excellent product, the battery lasts forever, the vacuum works perfectly, easy to clean. I've had older models and different brands, Norelco is still the best for me in trimmers."
4,A nice unit,"This is a replacement for a previous generation trimmer I had. I am sure this is the newer, updated model. The form factor is about the same. The vacuum power is stronger on this one. I was perfectly happy with the other that worked great for at least 5 years. Ultimately, it would no longer hold a charge. I think these are the best trimmers I have encountered. To get 5+ years out of one is an exceptional value. I have no reason to believe that this one won't last just as long. Recommended."
4,Works Well,"The T780 trimmer is a good product. It is not perfect but it does make trimming facial hair a lot less messy. While it does contain most of the trimmings, a few do escape. I would estimate the efficiency of capturing the clippings to be about 90-95%. It cuts easily and predictably with the adjustable head. In fact, its shortest setting is very short; shorter than some other trimmers I've used. Personally I like a narrower head, but the Norelco's size isn't much of an issue. Battery life is more than adequate."
4,Better than anything I've used before,"I have been using simple (aka cheap) hair trimmers for a while. When the battery in my last unit gave up I searched around and found this. This is a great product, trimming is smooth, you don't feel anything against the skin. The charger is convenient. The much hyped hair catcher doesn't do a good job, which robs it of a star. I use these things at home so travel pouch is not a great loss. Overall I am very satisfied with what I got for $26 and placing repeat order for a gift."
3,Dependable,"It works okay, but if you cut your hair short, it will leave hair lines. The vacuum part is decent, but nothing to write home about. The vacuum picks up about 70% of my hair, but maybe different for others."
4,Works good,"I had an older version Norelco vacuum trimmer, and this one works much better! There are almost no hairs on the counter when I'm done trimming. It's been 3 weeks since the first charge, and I haven't had to recharge it yet."
5,"Good Shaver, Good Price","I replaced an older Norlelco (5 years old) with this one and this is a very similar model, which is a good thing. Works well and holds a charge a long time. Price is good for the job that you want done."
2,Not a well designed trimmer,"I bought this product primarily to trim my mustache. It does not work well for that purpose. The design of this unit with the vaccuum feature prevents you from seeing what you are trimming. For shaving a beard, I imagine it would work fine. I gave the razor to someone who uses it to shave their head and they like it."
4,Quick and easy trimmer,"I bought this to replace an older model that had broken (it lasted 5 years). The vacuum seems to work well and the settings offer a pretty good range of trimming control. The only problem I have with it is that it seems that the guard pushes down some beard hairs around the back of my jaw line (near the hinge) and makes them harder to trim. Otherwise, it's excellent and I'll continue using it as long as my beard keeps growing!"
4,Good Product but could have been be better,I love the power and design but sometimes the comb level changer gets stuck and it is annoying to fix it. Overall - Recommended.
2,OK,"Great performance while it works. Died on me about a month and a half after buying,not sure what's wrong with it... light says it's charging but nothing comes on when i turn it on. This is my second Norelco product and both now have done the same thing. Only difference is that the other one lasted a lot longer."
4,Nearly Perfect,"I have to be honest, I was a bit doubtful about how well the vacuum was going to work. But the vacuum is awesome, I have a full beard and I can trim the whole thing with minimal whiskers on the couter top. Not having to hear the wife complain about the mess from the whiskers is worth the price of this trimmer. The only complaint I have, and I am starting to get used to it, is triming my mustache without the depth guide is challenging due to the little floating shield that helps the vacuum work so well. Regardless of this little issue I would happily buy the trimmer again and would recommend it to others."
1,Do Not Buy!,This is the worst trimmer I have ever bought. It takes twice as long a others because the hair gets stuck in the vacuum so you keep having to empty it out and then clean it.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.Steve
2,too bulky,This trimmer is too big and bulky to work well. The guide slips a little when using. When not using the guide it is difficult to use accurately because of the angle and the size. I sent this one back and bought my old one (T765). Although it doesn't have the vacuum function it is small enough to work much better.
2,A Total Miss...,"This trimmer was designed by someone without facial hair.About the only thing that works decently is the vacuum feature.As others have noted (and I foolishly ignored), the guard slips settings when only pressing with moderate force against your face. The only way to not accidently hack holes in your beard is to hang onto the adjustment ring when in use. The guard is also designed in such a way that it is really difficult to get that patch under your nose (poor detail control).A $15 plug-in is worth more than this thing."
4,It was OK,Was doin decent job likeother Norelco. But I am not happy with vaccum functionality.Actually its not possible to trim and vacumm each single hair.Other than that it works good.
4,very much satisfied with this product,"I have been using this product for past several months and there isn't any problem i've faced. The only issue is you can use this only for trimming i.e, you can't trim to size 0."
4,Comparison with T-980,"I am comparing this with a T-980 I have owned for several years & am very pleased with.Pros:--The on/off switch is a slider which will not turn on in your suitcase like the push button switch of the T-980.--The hair length selector is better designed to prevent accidental movement during use.--The charger is smaller/more compact.Cons:--Cannot be used with 110 charger when fully discharged (must be charged up, then used).--Charge indicator light does not flash when fully charged possibly leading to reduced battery life.--Does not come with smaller cutting blades for mustache trimming.--Does not come with storage bag or lubricant.--Does not have ""turbo"" function (which I never used anyway & is unnecesary)"
3,OOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKKKKK,"This product looks good in picture but not the best when used. Battery life is good enough but its trimming adjustments are not fine enough. The holder attached does not allow you to trim when your hair are not too much grown. If you have very thick layer of beard than only you can use it otherwise you have to remove the holder and use it and in this case it will work as a shaver which some people does not like , like me........."
3,It works good,This is my 2nd Beard trimmer. (I had purchased my other one nearly 5 years ago and this spring it just died.) The new on does the same thing as the old one and so far it is operating fine. It is the only one that cleans up after you and that is why I got it. I just hope that the new one lasts more than 5 years given that I use is only about 60 times per year.
2,B-,"This is alright.I thought it would be like my previous trimmer but have the vacuum so I don't make a mess.Turns out the vacuum is a great feature but it doesn't cut as well as my beard trimmer.Overall I use this for a quick trim on an existing beard, but I still use my old plain ""vanilla"" Norelco for making straight lines around the beard/ears etc."
4,Good trimmer - vacuum works well,"So far so good. Seems to be a good trimmer and the vacuum system works well, making cleanup easier and keeping the trimmings from fouling the blades. Good battery life between chargings, too."
3,Not for fine trimming,"I basically like the trim it gives most of my beard, and the vacuum works well. However, there's a plastic guard (I assume related to the vacuum) that makes it difficult to do close work, like trimming the moustache above the lip, or removing fine hairs on the upper cheek or side of the neck that you wouldn't want to shave. So if you get it I would recommend a second device for those areas, or if you have hairy ears or a unibrow."
3,Philips Trimmer,Spend a little more and get the one up from this one. I have that one to alot better works alot better to has the turbo on that one last longer I think.
2,Can't recommend,"I had a Norelco trimmer for a number of years and was very happy with it. The T780 works OK and I really like the vacuum concept.What I DON'T like is, the adjustment ring does not come with any marking to show the relative depth of cut. Thus, I'm merely guessing from one cut to the next.Also note (and this is not part of my rating), when you use Super Saver Shipping, they sit on the order for a week before they ship, so don't select it if you're in a hurry."
2,Vacuum gets in the way,"Got this to replace the ""Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer"" which died after about 6 or 7 years. not bad, and sent it back. the vacuum gets in the way of Mustache trimming and general clean up.I got another Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer. its cheaper and does the job perfectly."
3,Works O.K. but is a bit bulky,"I have a goatee and bought this trimmer to keep it groomed. It works well enough, but the trimmer is very large and may work better for someone with a full beard. It isn't well suited for fine trimming at the edge of the goatee. It does vacuum up the hairs well as advertised."
3,"OK for beard, mustache is a different story","This unit does a good job on my beard. It catches most of the trimmings.The length of the guide comb makes it almost impossible to trim my mustache. Had I known, I would have sprung for the more expensive unit which includes a mustache trimmer."
5,Domer Nation,"This book is highly recommended for anyone who wants an understanding of the Notre Dame football fan experience from the perspective of a recent alum.If you have not attended a game in South Bend, this book will make you feel as if you have never missed one.The pull of the place to folks who have never attended a class at any University is attempted to be put in words....It is a must read for a College Football fanatic."
5,Fast fresh strings,Had a difficult time finding xtra 10s multi-pack where I live - Now I'm back in string bending heaven - maybe I should switch to 11s
5,NORELCO GROOMERS G-380,AFTER BUYING SO MANY BRANDS I COME TO LEARN THAT THIS GROOMER CUT'S MY BEARD SO SMOOTH AND EVEN .FROM MY POINT OF VIEW NORELCO MAKES THE BEST GROOMERS I HAVE USE UP TO THIS DATE. AND I AM 53 YEARS OLD.
2,Not worth the money,I asked for this for christmas to replace a previous model. I am sad to say that this model is not as good. The adjustable heads have a lot of play in them resulting in an uneven trim if any pressure is used at all. Works good if you pay extra attention to the amount of pressure you use.
5,Husband fell in love again,"I bought this product for my husband as a Christmas gift and he LOVES it! I am glad a chose a good product for him to trim his beard. I highly recommend it for sure. It doesn't come with the stand but that's ok, I was told that Philips Norelco doesn't provide the stand anymore, but that's ok, I'm sure I can find a organizer at bed, bath, and beyond. :)"
2,Eventually died,"Had one of these and was fine, but eventually died.Had to be careful as attachments moved so you can easily get un evan hair cuts.My replacement was a Wahl (midprice point, rechargeable) and it just died.Hard to find good rechargeable."
4,dad loved it,I bought this as a birthday present for my dad and he just loved it. he liked the fact that it had all these different guards for different lengths and it has a nose hair trimmer as well.
4,Perfect beard trimmer,"This product is great for anyone that wants to keep a tidy beard, it has all the attachments that would ever be required. Without this, I wouldn't have the mood to keep a chinstrap."
4,Good gift,I got this as a gift for my fiancee and he likes it. He uses it to trip his goatee and he said he likes all of the attachments.
3,Ehh...,"It's good. Far from great. Features are nice. Takes FOREVER to charge initially. Why doesn't it just come with at least a half charge? Retarded. The trimmers work nice. Everyone else is correct, not a close shave, but if you wanna be Don Johnson circa 1987 - it works great! It's the damned lack of a charged battery at purchase that drives me nuts, rest is acceptable, especially the price."
1,not a new one,when the package reached my hands i was shocked to see it was refurbished/opened one which still had hair in the machine..how is it possible for the machine to have hair inside if it is a fresh one..philips norelco is pushing all its refurbished products through amazon..(it was mentioned by one of the reviewer also)..i was totally not satisfied and iam throwing it off...i bought this especially for my 3 year old son and now i have to look for a new one in shop and not in online as i am not ready to take a chance again..totally dissatisfied...
3,useless after rechargeable battery is dead,"Once the rechargeable battery is dead, the unit does not work when plugged in. Replacing the battery requires a so called professional. I could not simply open and replace with a new battery. Unit cannot be rinsed under water. Otherwise, it did work very well in cutting and trimming hair."
1,Not a good choice...,"I needed a new trimmer and selected this one trusting the brand name. I made a mistake. The thing is all plastic which I could live with if it only had some ease of use and features that were little more than poorly executed gimmicks. The parts are very smooth, light and hard to hold onto. They were constantly falling off. The button to turn it on is too close to the button that allows the removal of the head piece so I was constantly popping off the head piece when I turned it on. The piece would invariably bounce off the counter and onto the floor or worse, into the toilet. Also there is no travel case to carry all of those parts so what do you do with them if you want to bring it with you on a trip. Finally threw it all into the trash and am looking for a quality replacement. NOT recommended."
2,When will I learn to read the reviews FIRST??,"Actually, I would have probably bought this book if I had read the reviews beforehand. I worked and lived at the Moulin Rouge for a few years in the early 60's...that time period is not mentioned at all in Mr.Taylor's book! It was a most interesting place at the time...a cast of very colorful characters made it their home...to this day I believe some of the residents were in what we call today the Witness Protection Program.I was saddened by the recent fire at the MR, not only for the historical value of the hotel, but for my own personal history as well. The book is strictly one of a kind and unless someone writes something better in the wake of the fire, it is all we have to remember her by!"
2,Very funny book.,"Hmm. The two other reviews look like they might be written by the same reviewer. Odd. Anyway, anybody with a basic knowledge of physics will get a good chuckle out of this book, because the methodology for propulsion suggested is full of.. ""problems"". If nothing else, the author claims to have been researching this to file a patent, and yet does not provide us with a patent number in the text for us to review. A quick search of the USPTO's patent files also shows no patent on file for this bizarre technology. As with all bizarre claims, one must ask: if this works so well, why hasn't the author constructed a ship using this design, and why isn't he using it? (BTW: many public libraries have ""acquired"" this book, you might want to read it there first before you invest money into it. I did, and I'm still laughing.)"
1,terrible selection !,"This CD is live, in concert. The music is terrible! not like the Brenda lee one is expecting. It is awful I can not give it One star ! False info on it's description !The title fits the product!"
2,Not the Jeremiah Freed I know,"I'm not sure what happened to these guys.. I saw the 5 star review and couldn't wait to hear their new album. It's definitley not the Jeremiah freed of earlier. The guitar work is overdone and the singing just the same. The final track is a nice little tune but the rest are just too forced. if you rocked out to ""stranded"" ""again"" and ""rain"" do yourself a favor.. listen to that album again and leave this one alone."
1,How to play?,ok i bought it but somehow i can't james bond walk... does anybody knows what do i need to do? or do i need to put an analog in my psp? please help
3,Manhatten Mist Jersey Sheet Set,"I like the sheet set very much for quality but they were advertised as a shade of blue. I knew by other reviews of people's unhappiness with the color. I did not care because I was not trying to match a bedroom color. These sheets are as light grey as you can make them....not a bit of blue in them. But inspite of the color, they are nice sheets and was very happy with the cost of them and the job they are doing"
5,What is that?,"I love this show, it's really good; NOT quiet as good as I LOVE LUCY, but still very good. Anyone that loves Lucy as much as I do, I'm sure that your going to really enjoy this show like I do."
4,Just as good as regular pretzels,"I've been a pretzel fan for a long time, and these are definitely the equal of any pretzels one might find in any supermarket. Given that they're made without gluten, that's quite an accomplishment. I'd have preferred a bit more salt, but most people with a healthy diet will probably appreciate them more as they are."
4,Satisfying gf product,"I have enjoyed these pretzels many times. They are also popular with my gluten-eating family members. The only reason I'd rate these pretzels with four stars is due to the somewhat high fat content, most likely due the the second ingredient listed being palm oil. However, the low protein in these pretzels is a positive for those diagnosed with chronic kidney conditions.I will order again!"
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for these, based on the other reviews. I wanted to like them but I really don't, nor do my husband or son. To us they taste nothing like ""real"" pretzels, and are definitely not worth the calories, fat, or price. I know that this is because they lack the gluten, but they aren't very crunchy, more like crisp, since they aren't dense at all. They also have a funky, sort of metallic aftertaste."
3,They're Decent,"They taste good, and I love that they're in individual packets. I think they smell funny though. It's not a big deal."
4,good product,Was not disappointed in this product. Taste good and not too salty and provide a good crunch. I would recommend to others.
2,Too Much of a Good Thing,Good songs but not enough variation and so it all started to sound the same over and over and over. Think my money could have been spent better elsewhere.
1,Don't give this man your money,"Your banks, utility companies, and communications companies are all going to work just fine. If not, they'll roll their dates back on their computer so they keep working. This author is only trying to steal money from those who don't understand computers. Will food stop growing because of a computer problem?"
5,"I survived Y2K, did you?","If this book wasn't available, would any of us have made it? I mean, there we were, crouched in the basement, with the wood purifier humming next to us, and this book in hand when the world didn't quite end on January 1st, 2000, or again on January 1st, 2001. What better recommendation can there be?"
5,EXCELLENT! One of the best you could buy(overall) for Y2K !,"An even handed approach to Y2K, which guides the reader intelligently toward a safer future. This book offers you guidance in your preparations, not panic."
4,"Very balanced, systematic and understandable approach","I found this book to be very balanced in its approach to a sometimes emotional and irrational topic. The author presents an argument for calm, rational investigation of personal areas of potential impact if a 'loss' of society-based services result in Jan 1999. The analogy of a winter storm is very appropriate. I would urge everyone to read an think through these issues as presented."
2,Alarmist to the Nth degree,"After purchasing this book, we found out that the FAA is compliant, 80% of the Government is compliant, the FDIC is compliant and Wall Street is ready. Who are they kidding?? Save your money for a rainy day!!"
1,noise,My employer purchased this AC for my office. Noise level is impossible. The manufacturer refused to help.
1,"12,000 BTU Window Air Conditioner","I bought this to replace a 2-1/2 yr. old Haier A/C which had failed. This unit is quieter, makes more cold air, and is energy star rated. It also has a remote control which acts as a remote temperature sensor. This means that the unit keeps the temperature much more constant. It also allows you to bring in outside air, or not, at your choice.Overall I am extremely satisfied with this air conditioner.NOTE: After a month or so it started emitting a disturbing odor. I threw it away and bought a second one. It did the same thing after a while. I think this may be a leak of refrigerant. Unfortunately I no longer recommend this product."
2,Not as effective as larger model,"I bought this ""compact"" model to replace a dimensionally larger 12,000 btu Frigidaire unit 8 years old. Read the reviews and was confident it was as good as the earlier unit and would effectively cool our 650 sq' pool house. The older unit was about 5"" wider and would cool down the building within 10-15 minutes. This newer one does not cool as well. Guess that next time I will spend the extra bucks for the larger and more costly 15,000 btu."
1,Compressors not durable.,"I bought three of these for my office. 2 years later, all of the compressors have stopped working. Even when they were working, the three units were loud and they did not cool very effectively. Based on my experience with these air conditioners, I will never buy Frigidaire again and I would recommend you avoid them."
5,A great source for the beginning vegetarian!,"This book is absolutely wonderful for the beginning vegetarian, or for the experimental cook. In addition to fabulous recipes, it also contains little hints to make cooking easier, serving suggestions, as well as a visual guide to whether a recipe is entirely vegan, or if it contains eggs. This book is also completely appropriate for teen cooks. The recipes, while good, are not too complicated, and are explained in detail. I heartily recommend it."
3,"""Veggie"" interesting!","""MEAT""ing (pardon the pun) the challenges vegetarians face from transposing meat recipes into meatless; QUICK meals from ""scratch""; nutrition; all geared to the differing kinds of vegetarianism.(originally attempted to review this when the book first came out, but unfortunately the template did not ""take."")"
2,There is no point besides killing people,"There is a plot in this game but really all you have to do is go through all the rooms and kill everybody, and sometimes there are so many bad guys you wonder 'is there a website?' as you mow down 30 bad guys with a machine gun. i give it 2 stars instead of one for the graphics and the fact that you can upgrade your guns and equipment. i have lots of james bond games but this i dont really like becasue if you have tons of ammo with a machine gun you can beat any mission easy. although it is not like slaughtering the bad guys there are alot of ways to kill them from beating them up to shooting the grenade on there belt that will then fall off and blow up, you can gain wall cover and go into ""bond focus"" for pinpoint acuracy."
2,It lacks of style!!!,"This was supposed to be a game about a classic movie and about an iconic carachter at his best interpretation. The final result is just a repetitive shooter, with exception of sporadic use of some tools. It doesn't render the athmosphere and the spirit of the James Bond's movies, and every mission is the same you played on the level before. Too bad, because an old movie into a new game format it could have been an original and entartaining experience."
4,Retread,"This game is definitely inferior to Everything or Nothing. The auto-aim is pretty cheesy, and makes the game pratically play itself which isn't always a good thing. Additionally the auto-aim can be counter-productive when dealing with multiple distance enemies. The game to me is fun but seems much more linear than Everything or Nothing. Obviously though the main attraction to this title is the vintage 007 Sean Connery, which is the games saving grace. Admittedly it is pretty cool running around as the 1960's bond, and Connery's voice acting is good, if it wasn't for that new angle on 007 this game would be pretty much a bore. I would recommend renting and not buying. One other complaint is that the bonus levels are extremely stupid. Zzzzzzz Boring. However From Russia with Love is far superiour to Agent Under Fire and Night Fire.Bond Games Rank1.Eveything or Nothing2.From Russia With Love3.Night Fire4.Agent Under Fire (terribly cheesy and outdated)5.007 Rogue Agent ( a complete disaster)"
3,Not bad...not special either.,"Had a chance to finally try one of these out while staying as a guest at a relative's place. I'll admit that it feel amazing, and a nice mix of warm when you need it, and cool when cool feels right. That being said, it's a Bose-like product, wherein the price creates an image of superiority. At home I have a microfiber filled with artificial down comforter which feels, in my opinion, much softer and is better through a wide range of temperatures. Maybe if they refill the product with $100 bills, I'd bite.So in summary, I don't doubt that this is built with expensive materials, but it's beyond reaching the point of diminishing returns."
4,Wise words for women seeking wisdom,"This book was quite enjoyable. I commend Bishop Long on his ability to put so much insight into such a short book. This book is a good one for women who are beginning their walk with Christ. It is also a valuable tool in searching the scriptures for true women of faith. The book gives a glance into how to govern relationships with the Lord, the man in your life, other people and most of all with yourself."
2,A mistake,I ttok a chance on this movie because I like the cast and it's vintage. A mistake. A bad film badly presented and packaged. A charity shop donation.
2,Boring,"This is a pedantic book that might have some appeal to academics, but it seems to me repetitive and almost useless for serious and accomplished professionals. I also found it a difficult read, lacking in cohesion."
3,Silly story but some real history included,"The book ""She Was Nice to Mice"" is hard to describe, as it appears to be a children's book but includes details about sex between the queen and her husband. It is easy to read and innovative and the illustrations were drawn by a 12-year old and look like it."
3,"Nice Story, but historicaly inaccurate","This is an OK story that is saved by its description of Essex's death. The view of Shakespeare is interesting, but Macbeth (the Scottish play) did not get written until James I was King of England. In the end, this is a forgettable story."
4,Great Deal,I wanted just an inductrion cooktop for my RenaWare set but what I got was more than that. It came with a very good 12 inch fry pan with glass lid and complemented my set!!! I 've heen using this cooktop since I got it and I am impressed in the precision of the heat control. I double checked temperature with an infrared thermometer and is in a 2 to 3 degree in the range. I really reccomend the product.
1,Disappointed cooktop !,"I received the cooktop directly from Sunpentown which is the manufacturer but order through Amazon.com. You need special pots and pans to use this cooktop, otherwise the cooktop just shut itself off due to the safty feature. Well it sounds like a good idea, but buying pots and pans with special magnetic thing is too costly and too much of the hassel for me. Besieds it doesn't have any description on that matter. Please contact Sunpentown before placeing any order. Otherwise you will have to pay to ship it back and 15 % restocking fee !!"
3,Good single for the live songs,"Not a bad buy, for those who have the killng in the name single clear the lane is the same version found on there so nothing new here and an odd choice of song.Intro/zapata's blood is a great song, although the transition from intro into zapata's blood has a noticeable gap, which seems stupid considering its basically one song, but if you look past this mixing stuff up its still a worthwhile single."
2,Full of errors!,"This book is full of errors and does not reflect the changes in the new exam. I teach GED students, and I am extremely disappointed with this book."
1,This book was a huge disappointment!,"I purchased this book for our library and was really disappointed. The crafts and activities aren't very interesting and didn't inspire me to want to do a single project. For a better investment buy ""Christmas Crafts and Entertaining"", put out by Creative Publishing. Now that is a great book with great ideas and great instructions. I've already made two table runners."
4,"should be standard for these cases, the foam is junk","very overpriced for what it is, but there isn't much choice if you made the mistake of buying the diced foam in the case. buy the case with this divider already in it. the tan color is MUCH better then black where you can't see anything inside the case."
5,Great ring!,"I bought one of these for my sister and she loved it. Then for my birthday my boyfriend got me the same one but with my birthstone (saphire). Thank goodness I had gotten it for my sister because I thought I lost it so I bought this one as a replacement! I ended up finding the first one and now I have two, still in great condition. They don't leave marks on your fingers and have not tarnished one bit."
1,warning about price,This same exact ring is sold at many other websites for $19.98 USA dollars please be warned. I wonder if they buy the rings at those sites and resell them here for more?
5,awesome deal,"This is a very shiny silver ring! The stone is a nice dark color and is large! It really looks great in the sun, Looks way better in person than pics. Thanks for the deal!"
5,nice ring,I bought two of these sapphire rings for my twins granddaughters for Christmas and they just love them. It is hard finding a size 4 so I was really pleased that they fit perfect. This ring is really pretty and not to too flashy.
5,My new favorite ring,"I bought the ring b/c my birthstone is Sapphire and I'm Scots/Irish. By far it is such a good quality ring for the price. The stone is perfect, the silver is thick and good quality and lovely celtic design."
4,Runs a little big,"This ring is very pretty and of good quality for an inexpensive ring. However, it does seem to run a little big . . . I'm probably going to have to get a ring guard."
5,Beautiful!,"I really, really like this ring! I received it as a promise ring from my boyfriend for Valentine's day (to be replaced when I finish my degree.) The only potentially negative thing would be that the stone is so dark it almost looks black sometimes, but I don't mind. I actually like the darker color. I am planning on getting the matching pieces sometime soon!"
3,"Beautiful, but tarnished quickly","I've had the ring for about 2 months now. It is beautiful, the blue sapphire is very pretty & I get lots of compliments on it. The only downside is that it began to tarnish within 2 weeks of being shipped to me."
5,Sapphire Ring,"I just love the sterling silver sapphire ring. The celtic knots on the side make it extra special The delivery was incredibly quick. And best of all, the price was right."
4,Nice ring,The ring is very pretty and my friend was extremely happy to receive it. I was pleased at the speed in which it arrived.
3,"Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Blue Sapphire Ring Size 11 (Size 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 15) Review",I had gotten the wrong size for this ring at a size 11 and I never returned it to get a smaller size to my mistake. But I like the ring.
1,horrible,i am very disappointed. my girl had the ring not even 4 hours out of the box and it began to tarnish and turn her finger green. i will say anything but bad things about this company
5,Amazing!,An excellent album that shines with musical passion. Dave follows no ones standards but his own and the result is fresh and exciting. He covers the gamut from pop to jazz to funk and pulls it off flawlessly. If you are a fan of virtuosity then this album is for you!
3,Grand story with too much detail...,"For a ""short history"", author was way too long on individual battle details. Day after day; battle after battle...way too detailed for this reader seeking significant causes, major events and overall resolution."
2,A never ending list of bloody battles,If you enjoyed Stokesbury colorful and intersting books on the american history and you look for another intersting history book you better get away from this one. The book is a never ending list of bloody battles. The book starts with a very intersting account of the events that led to this bloody war but the rest of the book is really hard to read. The book does give an informative account of the war and it may be that the war should be blamed for this unintersting account of events and not the author.
4,Condense version of WWI,"This is a great book to read if your WWI knowledge is quite limited, as mine was. It really help link the reason why the war started and why WWII ensued."
5,Reggae at its finest,"With this offering Tarrus Riley proves he is the next prince of roots rock reggae; a cool ruler, presiding over the conscious culture, ensuring the genre remains true!One Love, Bless"
5,Excellent Talent,"One of the best reggae cd's I have listened to in a long time.Every song has a message, no fillers here."
3,Parables,"This product is okay, I thought it would have been a great CD but there are only 2 good songs on it, #6 & #7.Thanks"
2,Unintentionally Comic,"Good Lord! What a mess! No wonder the Stones suppressed this. Forget being ""upstaged"" by the Who-this was a classic waste of money and is mainly interesting as a sort of unintentional comedy.The Who certainly ripped things up,but Jethro Tull are simply awful-they honestly look like circus performers,and one wonders how on earth they made the cut.Taj Mahal steals the show with authentic Chicago style blues, but the rest of the performers,including the Stones,appear exhausted and confused.Special note should be made of the lackluster performance by John Lennon fronting what should be a dream band-and then Yoko Ono gets the microphone! The ""real"" circus perrformers seem to be imposters. The Pete Townsend interview is interesting, but this is really just a footnote. Jagger & Co showed good sense in putting this in the vault. Too bad...it must have cost a fortune to make. One last note-this is proof that your kids are going to laugh at your clothes,no matter how cool you were."
2,weak,This is dated material. I prefer the later dvd's like Bridges to Babylon. I rented this a went thru it in about 15 minutes. Not a keeper.
3,Some good stuff,"I've fast forwarded through sections of this, and have never looked at them at all once I did that. So that's not much of a compliment. But the Stones do a great version of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash,"" and quite good versions of others of their songs. Lennon singing ""Yer Blues"" is great. What amazes me (and makes me jealous!) is that Lennon sings so powerfully, and he doesn't seem to have to put much effort in it to do so. That's how incredible his voice was! Yoko warbling is pathetic. Her being in the movie is the worst type of nepotism. Yuck! But the highlights are worthwhile."
4,The Rolling Stones - Rock and Roll Circus,"The gem of this video is the excellent performance by the Who. Truly extraordinary to see these guys at their peak. ""A Quick One While He Is Away"" caught the avid interest of my college age son who quickly found the song on ITunes and donwloaded it. This tune is an obvious precursor to the Tommy album. The other performances are of interest to fans of late sixties groups. The jam by John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and friends is great but one has to have a certain sensibility to appreciate the Yoko Ono vocals. The Rolling Stones are pretty good but one might think they are a bit tired. As I understand it this one day (+) shoot had the Stones performance last and in the wee hours of the morning. Still a great treasure from a golden age of Rock and Roll."
3,Rock and Roll Circus,"If you are a fan of the Stones and Beatles, you should have this. Great performances by the Stones in Particular."
5,Chicken roaster,Works like a charm and leaves the chicken fat in the collection basin below. The chicken is tender and moist.
2,Teflon on basin flakes off after 8 or 9 uses....,"This roaster works very well, and folds up to store in small spaces, but you have to watch out for two problems (one minor, one major). First, for a 5lb fryer, the drippings collected will overflow the basin, especially when you remove it from the oven. You need to place another pie pan under it to avoid sloshing. More importantly, after using mine eight or so times, the teflon is spontaneously flaking off the basin. (Please note I hand-washed the basin with hot water, soap, and a sponge, and made sure to never touch it with metal.)If you're not worried about making gravy with the drippings, this may not bother you. Me, I like making gravy, and it's a real concern.I'm going to get another upright roaster, but this time I'm getting a stand-alone frame I can place in a pie pan, and I'm avoiding teflon altogether. I think it's having trouble with long-term exposure to the ultra-hot drippings."
2,1 week of use and the fan is already rattling,"I've been using this power adapter for a week and now the fan is rattling real loud. I don't know how much longer this plastic crap is gonna last. It's keeping my laptop charged for now, but for how long?"
4,Works well,"I got it last month to charge my Iphone on my 2011 Outback. It definitely is a bit noisy, but playing music usually suppresses the noise. There is a loud whining noise if you start it up on cold mornings, but that noise goes away after a few minutes (once the unit warms up) and is replaces by the white noise generated by the fan.But the unit itself is compact and very handy. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,A *LITTLE* too loud????,"The fan in our unit whirred fairly loudly to begin with, but also buzzed and rattled so loudly that you had to constantly tap it, shift its position, etc., to stop the buzzing.I gave up eventually, and bought a different unit from a local Radio Shack, halfway through our road trip. This unit did have a quietly whirring fan which could be drowned out by the radio, iPod, etc., and I can live with that."
1,Blows fuses,"I got this unit to provide power to several devices while on the road. Unfortunately it has blown fuses in ever vehicle (at least the 3 I've tried). It's the fuses in the car, not on the unit itself. So a box of fuses later, I have yet to be able to get it work."
5,good alternative for cell phone car chargers,great product; beats buying a new car charger for your cell phone every time you buy a new phone
1,Blew out fuses in car within 15 minutes of first use,"After that experience, I replaced the fuses in the auto for the power outlets and tried it again, but now unit was dead.The only item plugged in was a DELL Laptop Computer.I have not had time to pursue returning it as defective, but need to do so."
2,"It works, but super noisy","It works, but very, very noisy, like a hair dryer.I cannot even hear my wife talking while it's on though some people may enjoy that feature."
4,"Big, but gets the job done.","When I go on road trips, I make sure to take this with me. It's a little big, but it's still handy. I'm not sure where to put it in my car though. I want to to be able to vent itself, so I don't want to put it into my glove box. but it's annoying to ask my passenger to have them hold it the entire trip. Maybe I'll get some velcro and have it stick to the dash. Bottom line, it's a great product (when you can get it on sale like I did)((twenty bucks))."
3,Too big for in-cab device but works,"Its a good product, works as expected but there are some issues with size and noise levelPros: deliveres what you need.Cons:To big for an in-cab deviceNoise"
3,A Little Loud For Me,This Belkin inverter is much louder than the 140 watt inverter (which is difficult to hear at all). You can easily drowned out the noise with your radio but the pitch was a little too high for me.The 300 watt unit is only a little bigger with a second outlet than the 140 watt inverter. It comes with an automotive type fuse (30 amp) which does seem to be very useful if your car lighter fuse is 10 or 15 amp.
5,Good product,"I got this for road trips, I had a old 1 socket 85 watt inverter that was not able to power my laptop during trips. This can present a problem because I like to use my laptop on long trips as a GPS. This can easily handle my 17in laptop which sucks power like its going out of style. The noise is something I was worried about, but after using it, its really not loud at all. At freeway speeds you will never hear it unless you decide to hold it in your lap for some unknown reason. With just minimal sound on the radio you won't ever hear it. For the amount of power it puts out, the noise is excellent. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good powerful inverter. The power switch is a plus and so is the cord length."
1,The band that should be kept secret in Germany,"The second CD from a band you ask yourself, why are they popular in Germany? After hearing 1 minute, it becomes crystal clear! No one in Europe can understand their weak, trite and banal lyrics. It is obvious why they have no chance of success in an English speaking country. The music is such Euro-pop. This is NOT ROCK. This group should be forced to listen to real rock and sign an agreement to never claim their pop dribble is even akin to the holy word, we so fondly know as Rock. It is amazing how boring a group can be. There is nothing remotely rock in style on this CD. It is as if they removed everything good about rock, and sterilized it for 15 year old girl consumption. This group is most forgetful. The cover of this and other CD is further proof of their pop direction. They appear on the cover of every CD with clean and ironed shirts, and nicely combed hair!!! What rock band would do this?"
5,the trilogy in one cover,"This is three books: valerie, stephanie, and norah, all in one cover. I have posted the summaries of each of these stories under the original books.This trilogy is a wonderful set of stories, held together by family love - the love of a beloved father who is critically ill.If you like Nora Roberts series, you will like this.(*)>"
5,Good Summer Reading,"I am new to reading books and i could not put this one down. Debbie Macomber made the book very easy to read and i especially enjoyed all the charachters and the way the story is told from the three diffrent sisters. I also enjoyed the way it took lace in orchard valley,made you want to be there. Thanks Mrs Macomber for such a great book."
4,Very pleased with my purchase.,"If you like to learn new painting technics, and be inspired by others, this is a fantastic book."
1,The Handbook of Painted Decoration,"I have not received this product, please contact me as soon as possible, It did not come with the other two that I orderedYolanda Solana"
2,Too much for too little,"I eagerly looked forward to obtaining this book to review the ""standings, statistics and rosters"" of minor league football. Maybe I missed something, but I see no rosters in this book. There is a player register, but no rosters for any of the leagues. Also, the statistics included in this book are no better than many websites that provide the information for free. Also, the player register does not have uniform numbers. Maybe I expected too much, but for $50 I expected a lot more."
4,The Garment Jungle,A solid film noir film about the gangster influence on the garment industry in New York. A fine performance by Lee J. Cobb as the head of a garment manufacturing company trying to keep the union out of his company.
1,Worst 20 bucks I ever spent,I cannot believe the whole series was not included on this dvd. It felt like it lasted 30ish mins. . The worst part is they even tell you to stay tuned for the rest of the series which never happen. Awful! What did they run out of DVD tape lol?? Cheap rip artist!
2,Leakage Problems,I bought three of these for my family. We used them for hiking and skiing. All of them started leaking after few trips. I recently bought new ones from Costco which are more ergonomic and working great so far. I would like to see how they do during coming skiing season.
4,A interesting twist,"Surrender to a Wicked Spy by Celeste Bradley is the second book in the Royal Four Series which takes characters from her earlier series the Liar's Club. I am reading both of the series out of order so that is interesting. This novel tells the story of Dane (one of the Royal Four) who must marry someone who he would never love - so he picks Olivia. For most of the novel Olivia is trying to understand Dane while he tries to ignore Olivia. The second half is pure adventure and mystery. The Royal Four Series To Wed A Scandalous Spy (1), Surrender to a Wicked Spy (2),One Night With A Spy (3) and Seducing The Spy."
1,Pretty Lame,This book was pretty lame. The french spy plot was pretty cheesy and non compelling. The idea that the hero couldn't even get a prostitute to do him because of his size is pretty ludicrous and the whole thing with the fake phalluses was neither good love scenes nor good women's erotica. Messy unexplained motivations all around and gratuitous humilitation for the heroine. The author tried too hard to be cute and funny. Try Patricia Veryan for much better historical spy series in the romance genre.
1,can't say I liked it,"I have sat here thinking, if I could describe this book in just one word, what would that one word be? Then it came to me - DUH! And I rate this book a very enthusiastic DUH! because of the ""sex problem"". How disappointing when I have enjoyed previous works by this author."
3,"it's good,","i find it enjoyable but i found that little was happenning for the thicheness of the book.I like the fact that for once there are married from the beginning and descover each other without waiting to hate each other along the way, refershing"
1,It's a shame i can not rate it 0 strars!,One of the silliest books I ever read! The plot doesn't make sense! The action... welll.. I rather not comment!I hope that in the next book Celeste Bradley will redeem herself!
2,Not as described,"This book is maybe in fair, not good, condition. It is a 1948 printing with quite a bit of water damage. I'll keep it but I'm unhappy and won't buy from Winter Ventures again. Disappointing."
1,ZzZzZzZzZzZzZ,This book is really boring. It's very hard to get into and you never quite realize what the author is trying to say! It's not a book I recommend.
3,Cute but just for display...,"I purchased this item for a friend who wanted to have a representation of Moses in their office - sort of like keeping scriptures on your office wall kind of thing and for that purpose this figure is great. It has a comforting appearance - the features are pleasant and so forth. However, it is sort of delicately made so if you need to bend the parts or really want to be able to take the staff on and off or so forth - it's not a good idea. Bending or rotating the movable joints causes the arms to loose tention and to droop at bit after reposing so if you are just looking as I was, for something that would make a reasonable display, this is a comforting product in appearance and worth it. Nice size and so on. But it would not be up to actual posing or active use."
3,Moses,The tablet came loose right away. Other than that the Moses figure is perfect for story time from the Bible.
4,Fun Game,"This game is basically like the Grand Theft Auto series, but in HD and with more options. I am a huge fan of the Grand Theft Auto series, so this game is right up my alley. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that has similar tastes in video games."
3,average,"Some nice game play features in this game - like store hold up, reviving dead team members.But story line missions seems shorter than gta games."
3,I thought the xbox-360 would offer alot more,"I was going to wait for the PS3 to be my next generation system, but I took a chance on this game and bought the xbox-360. The major problem this game has is the overwhelming amount of glitches. You would think that high definition gaming would counteract these horrible miscues but that is definitely not the case. Overall the game looks and plays better than GTA, but I ve only had it for a month and I cant play it any more because all sorts of things just continually appear and dissapear before my eyes and I cant deal with that. I hope GTA4 fixes these bugs when it is released in October 2007."
4,GTA on speed,I enjoyed Saints Row except it seems like Grand Theft Auto almost part to part. Playing this games story mode is a little slow and daunting. What I really enjoy is playing online. That is where the real fun exists. Playing battles against eleven others makes it a lot of fun especially with the live experience. That is why my rating is higher than what it should be. Without online I would only give this game three stars.
1,GTA clone; can't get past 5% due to game freezes,forget that this piece of garbage is a GTA clone for a moment...it doesn't even work...it has frozen on me 4 times in a row...unable to get pat 5% of completion due to freezes...inexcusable for a piece of trash that has been out this long to do this...
2,Eh... another game to play drunk...,The game has a few fun points but overall the fun-ness wears off fast. It gets really old really fast doing the same stupid quests over and over.
5,Better than GTA4,"Just like the GTA but better, yes thats right it is better than all the GTA games. This game is so much fun, its not repetative, its not easy but its also not too difficult to play, my favorite 360 game so far, this game is awsome!"
1,GLITCHES GALORE!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME...IT IS FILLED WITH GLITCHES!!!...IT'S LIKE DRIVER 2 FOR PLAYSTATION IF ANYONE HAS EVER PLAYED IT AND SEEN HOW UNDERDEVELOPED THE GAME WAS...I CAN'T DO MUCH IN SAINTS ROW WITHOUT FALLING THROUGH THE GROUND OR FREEZING UP IN A CAR...THE GLITCHES HAVE KILLED THIS GAME FOR ME
2,SAINTS ROW IS REALLY BORING AFTER A WHILE,"Ive bought this game 2 different times and both times have disappointed me, it's a beautiful game, with a great soundtrack, but the story is really stupid and non original, its really fun when you first play it, but it really lacks any replay value, once you've already gotten all of the clothes and jewlery (which is'nt much) there's nothing to do. Just drive around and do the boring side missions. When you first play its fun just to rob people and make money to buy clothes."
2,Graphic Language Overload,"This game has a lot of graphic language that takes away from the whole experience. Some graphic language is fine, but this is ridiculous."
4,"Even if it's a GTA clone, this game rocks!","There are many similarities, and many things missing from GTA -- flying planes, riding cycles & bikes, base jumping, gambling, etc. However, the graphics and overall gameplay are great, and you could spend hours (read:days) wreaking havoc and causing mayhem. This game will cause the GTA franchise to raise the bar on it's future games for the 360 & PS3 because Saint's Row is looking over its shoulder."
3,Not bad at all,"It really is good. Only downside is the main charcter does not talk at all, and you cannot play as a woman only as a guy. You cant really buy ammo and its almost easy to die. I don't understand why people are diving in the roads everytime I drive its crazy. Good part is the story line, customize your own vehicle , guns, and good acting."
5,Saints Row,Definatley meets its repuation as a Platinum hit. A lot of activities to do outside the main story. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good third person shooter
4,COOL,I like that I can creat my own look in this game it not just a guy that they give you ! Also the radio when you drive around is got cool music in it so that helps you when you playing for hours
4,xbox 360 game,I got the game for my grand son and he is enjoying it. The game was shipped fast. I was glad to find it at such a low price. Thank you.
5,This game rules. Straight up.,"This game is fricken awesome. Ridiculously addictive and fun. The fact that people keep saying ""Wah wah wah it's like GTA blah blah blah."" No duh. It's a 1st person gang game. Should everyone shun Halo, Quake, etc. because they took the same ideas as Doom and Wolfenstein? Nope. This is just a great game. Simple as that."
3,"SR looks better than GTA, but thats about it...","seriously, guys, none of you are serious gamers if all you can do is whine about how Saints Row is better because its ""easier"" than GTA... WUSSIES! You can say that it looks better, but that's the only improvement. The GTA game play is actually challenging, and there are consequences when you make mistakes. Its one of the rare games that forces you to get better. Play them 100 percent and you've logged more hours than some people work in a year. Plus, they ripped off Rockstar."
4,Great game,"I'm more of a GTA IV fan, but Saints Row is a fun game to me as well. It's a pretty fun game, and since it's cheaper these days, it's a great deal. I sort of miss the cartoony/arcadish feel of the older GTA games, and this game reminds me of that sort of feel. The only let down is there's only 4 wheel vehicles, and the vehicles look a bit too unrealistic for what I'm used to, but that's ok. That doesn't take away too much of the fun."
4,Would recommend this title!,"This game is so addicting, I played it whenever I had free time this week, and suprisingly enough I've beat all the main missions. That is my biggest dissapointment, that I finished the story line in less than 20 hours of gameplay. Now all I have left to do in the game is all the ""filler"" activities like find CD's through out the city *BORING*, and finish 1 or 2 short levels of escorting or finding those last 3 cars on the chop shop list and of course all the other ""filler"" that I'm not interested in in the least. But, definitely go buy the game if you think paying that much $ for 20 hours of pure excitement and fun is worth it, or go rent it twice from the movie store and beat it. I bought the game on Monday and I beat the main missions * I was 68% done with everything in the game when I won * on Friday evening, keep in mind that I go to school and work. That is the biggest disapointment, easy and short.Are you ready for this playa?"
5,The best game to date for the 360.,"Of course that is my opinion, however what a fun game. I know this game is alot like GTA, to many ways to count. The graphics are really great and gameplay is fun. This is the type of game that you can play for the next few months and not get tired of it because there is so much to do in the game. This is what we want as gammers. I like the fact that once you do a few missions you are not limited to what area of town that you can go, there are no road blocks set up which I think is awesome. I am unable to write a full review seeing how I am only 11% done with the game. Buy the game play it and love it. Not a game for younger kids."
5,loved it,got it loved it it was the best game of its timegangs shooting explosionswhen it came out i said i have to have itwhen i got it i was not disappointed i loved itwhat more could you ask for
4,Carnage Fun!!,"Very fun game, very similar to the GTA Series, even better in certain areas. Although lacking air and sea vehicles and no motorcycles, but the variety of vehicles and missions makes up for it."
5,great game,"how can i explain what makes it a little better the GTA... well imagine any thing that annoyed you in GTA or any problem that needed fixing and you will find it in this game, for one thing its easier then GTA, so many things you discover that are new even if you had it for a while, i have a feeling this game will disapear and fall in sales when GTA for PS3 comes out but hey thats not for a long long time, yes more delays from Sonywhat i love about this game is when the cops come to your hood and you entire gang starts shooting at them, also unlike GTA when the cops arrest you and you come out you still have your wepons!!!!"
1,Beware the Warner version of this disc,"I recently bought some old pickett and the sound quality was good on all but this disc. I have the Man and a Half collection and the three original albums: The Sound of..., Wicked Pickett, and The Exciting... Everything sounds good except for this disaster. It is a terrible recording. The comparison in quality between this and the same songs on the anthology is huge. The other originals have very good sound quality, but this one is terrible. There is another verison of this disc by Collectables that I am tempted to try, but I regret buying this one because of the sound. Great Pickett, bad sound. I got this at ImportCDs so beware what they are selling."
5,A Taste For Money.,"Wow! What an excellent book! As soon as i started i could not stop. I finished in 3 days. The compelling story of 3 men overcome with the plague of greed is absolutely fantastic. Great graphic accounts and and overall outstanding job in all areas of the book. This book satisfied my thirst for mystery,action,and a law enforcement genre of a book. Every account was significant and the story unfolded very vividly thus,making the book one of the best i have ever read. Now i cant wait to read both of the others. Pete i wont hesitate to say YOU are the man and thanks for the good read."
5,"ATL, BOLO ALL COPS","Attention All Cops: These books are Fantastic! As with all of Peters' books, this one I could not put down. They are all fun to read,and very well written!! Being a police officer myself, I can relate, you will too. Every one (yes, even us cops) who enjoys a good book MUST read these!! Enjoy!!!"
5,Best Tool Ever!,"7 years after I bought it, I am placing my review... 7 years of camping, fishing, home improvements, car work, bike work, electrical work, water, sea water, sand, mud, coconuts, fruits, spears, and the list goes on and on and on... BEST TOOL EVER!"
3,Dave but not Clarke,"The record selection is very great, all the clubgroovers are on it and the electro selection is also subtile. But.. the mixing is [not what it could be], everybody who has heard Dave busy alive will agree with me. World Service is [lacking,] mixed with almost no scratches or effects, thats just too bad, otherwise this would have been a classical peace of techno and electro.."
4,Parallex,"This is typical of all Buck knives from my experience, which is excellent. I have found no difference in quality from the Buck USA knives vs. the Buck China knives..this one is from China. The blue handle is great looking, the coated blade is very sharp. Only giving this 4 out of 5 stars though, because its not the most comfortable knife to hold in your hand. My Buck with wooden handle and knickel bolsters feels like an extension of my hand.. the Parallex is a bit ackward. But for this price, don't pass up this very nice knife."
3,Nice Knife But....,This is a perfect gentlemans knife. Nice size and features. Good blade that holds and edge and no play in the blade at all. The only problem is it is hard to open using the thumb stud. I've had it a couple of days and when I first got it I could open it with the thumb stud but now my thumb is so sore there is no way. I don't know if it will get better as time goes by but this thing is a challenge to open one handed.
5,Great Series,"This review is here to cancel out the only other review on here. Sharpe's is a great series. The fact that this DVD set is a Region 2 release (Which it says right on the page) is not a valid reason for giving this product a 1-Star Review. That is the fault of the buyer. So I'm giving this excellent series a 5-Star Rating because it deserves it.As for the Sharpe series, it is one of the best historical dramas out there. The acting, writing, and directing is brilliant. The only problem arises from the production values. From reading reviews on Amazon.co.uk it sounds like this version has a better transfer than the American DVDs. The quality of those are distracting at times. Region free DVD players are not that expensive, so if you're interested in these DVDs this might be the way to go. Considering how expensive the American copies are it might even be cheaper."
1,Sharpe's Series,"I'm 61-that said, I was looking at the sale price and had no idea that there are ""regions"" when it comes to purchaing DVDs. I had guests over to watch the Sharpe's series and low and behold no way to watch; no players to purchase locally; a huge disappointment and a lot of feeling really stupid that not one of us knew a thing about ""regions"". I doubt any of us will purchase DVD online again since I'm now in dispute on paying the charges and have turned it over to my credit card company! Buyer Beware...And we so wanted to enjoy these movies!"
3,Is it hard to use - or is it just me?,"I found the product difficult to understand and use. But then, I am not a 'tech-type' guy so it may have just been me and not the software."
5,What a treat!,"I had the original Michael Johnson LP and am delighted with this Cd which has all 10 songs from that album as well as 10 I'd never heard. I found it in a strange way. I had to do a yearbook write up on my daughter in""25 words or less."" I was sure I'd heard a song with that title. I typed it into a search engine on the internet and got the hit that it was a Michael Johnson song. I can't play my LP anymore since I don't have a working turntable. So when I found it here, I ordered it and have been listening to it ever since!"
5,Brand new; Great deal; Excellent service; Fast shipping.,"Not much to say other than very happy with this product, price and service. Thanks!"
2,Accidentally Bought This,"This was in my shopping cart and I accidentally bought it along with three other books I really wanted. So, now that I have this EOS 10D book I must say it is VERY simplistic and not worth the $35 I paid for it. It is way too similar to the manual and offers an extrememly simplistic source on photography and digital graphics and imaging in general. For those that ""don't read the manual"" maybe this book will help.Mea Culpa, Ken."
4,Humorous and Enjoyable,"I don't believe I've ever used the word `romp' to describe a book before, but that word seems to suit Nina Bangs' Master of Ecstasy. If you're looking for something deep and thought provoking, look elsewhere. However, if you're in the mood for an enjoyable read, something light, sexy (and maybe just a little silly in parts), but with humor and a touch of magic, this paranormal romance might deliver just what you're looking for. And, if you grow attached to them, the Cosmic Troublemakers Ganymede and Sparkle Stardust appear in a number of Bangs' other novels. Enjoy!"
4,great,"Nina Bangs is a great writer, she takes you into a different world and you don't want to stop reading. Enjoy her books."
3,OK but fragile,Bought this to try manual drip coffee in search of the perfect cup. It didn't pour well...I'd have to tilt the side toward the end to get the measured water into my teapot without pouring some of it down the outside. Other than that it was a fine coffee maker.....not much to it.....until it broke while washing out with a brush. I thought I was being gentle. I'm now using the pot from my old coffee maker. Turns out it's much easier to pour into the teapot and I've had it for several years without mishap.
3,"Melitta coffeemaker, A good buy, but....","This Melitta coffeemaker does exactly what it's designed and advertised to do. However, after it arrived and I've had a chance to use it a couple of times, I've realized my regular coffeemaker is faster and more convenient. I bought the Melitta to use when I wanted just a cup or two. I thought it would be quicker and less clean up than using my regular drip coffee maker but that's not the case.With the Melitta you have to heat the water in a separate container and stand there while you pour the heated water in the cone as it brews. With my regular coffeemaker I just pour the water in using the carafe and turn it on. I also think it taste better from the regular drip coffee maker.Still it's a good buy for the price and I think it's good to have around as a spare coffeemaker."
5,"Nice service, thank you.",This was for my brother. He was very happy that I found the product from you. We appreciated having expedited shipping as an option.
1,Disappointed with Ambient Weather,"While this product might very well make excellent cofffee, we have yet to find out because it arrived to us with the plastic filter part smashed into bits. I of course contacted Ambient Weather, and politely described the situation, and they got back to me right away telling me that I should contact the distributor. I emailed them back to say I was hoping they would do that, since they have a relationship with the distributor, and they emailed me distributor info.I was surprised they didn't feel any obligation to their customer to correct the situation, which would have entailed one simple phone call to the distributor, asking for a replacement part, especially since the product they represent, and profitted from my ordering, arrived unusable.I will return this item to Ambient Weather, and don't plan on ordering from them again."
2,too much trouble,"This is too much trouble to make coffee by heating and then pouring hot water through the coffee maker. I would be willing to do this if the coffe was better than when I make it in a electric pot. Also the coffee is weak unless you pour hot water then let drip, then pour more hot water. At the end of making coffee this way, the coffee must be manually reheated. I only make one cup per day. This consisits of about 10 ounces."
2,Fire hazard,"I'm not a coffee drinker, but my wife is, and she likes this coffee maker. I cracked the glass vessel of hers by turning on a burner under it when it was empty. Another issue: the handle reaches down near the stove top and if carelessly placed over a burner, can melt, drip liquid plastic onto the burner, and even catch on fire.In my opinion, this is not the best design -- though I don't know others to compare. In particular, the handle really ought to have been made of a more heat-resistant material or else located differently."
3,Average Cliffs Notes Performance,"This is difficult to understand at times, but if the original text is examined, the themes laid deeply are also difficult to understand. Thus, Cliff once again brings new facets as well as old interpretations to an old text."
1,not happy,This movie was very slow. The 4 year olds lost interest right away. The flash cards were a lot of fun for them to use and learn.
3,Gun Dog Video Training,"I thought the video left out how some steps on training with the dog collar, but over all it was ok."
4,here's the artists,"Atabaque (Jazzanova)Banana (Clara Moreno)Flyin away (Mo Horizons)Get carter (BB Davis & the Red Orchidstra)Do it some more (Brains Unchained)Apollo (Dissent)Icarus descending (Flamingos feat Jose Feliciano)Propulsion (Extended Spirit)Running fast (Zeljko Kerleta)A partner and a friend (Queen Ayacodobae)Danse macabre (Domino Park)I don' t need it (D Bug)I recognize 4 of the 12 artists, should be a groove!"
3,the arrival of Nicholas Blair,"Reverend Trask's vengeful ghost captures Cassandra Collins (a.k.a. Angelique) and appears to destroy her through an exorcism. But Elizabeth Collins Stoddard remains under her spell, believing she'll be buried alive.A fearful Barnabas Collins suspects Angelique will return and again curse him as a vampire when a mysterious stranger named Nicholas Blair arrives at Collinwood claiming to be Cassandra's brother."
4,clear winner,a product that offeres a full solution for my house.pros: 2.4 does not interfere with baby monitors 900m or wireless 2.4great communication and productcons: no number for message countbuy this phone system
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this phone, but it is terribly disappointing. It gets spotty reception even in the house when not in the same room as the base unit, and it is all but unusable in the yard. I have moved the base to several different locations in the house and done everything they recommend, but no change."
5,This one is a gem.,"From the very late late 70s to the early 80s, this was an incredibly prolific band. Sometimes I think ""superstardom"" eluded them because their songs (all right, Paul Weller's) were so well-written and maybe a just little too fluid for the hardcore punk scene and too hard for the 'new wave' scene. Maybe Weller's writing reaches in too deep for some. Maybe their music was consistently too good. Maybe they broke up too quickly. I don't know. I liked them then and my appreciation has only grown.This particular album takes a lot of cuts that were more album 'gems' as opposed to singles. Every time I listen to it, I find myself playing it all the way the through and sometimes twice.The Jam's music is classified by many as somewhere on the line between punk and so-called 'new wave', though closer to punk than The Police. They 'rock' and they make you think.I still sometimes really 'feast on their music'."
3,i'm 17 and I have never heard them before now...,"In some punk catalogue there were a couple of patches and buttons... i think they sound cool... i actually got to this site by looking at a band called the kinks. i like a song they have on the local oldies station.... it is a christmas song that says something like ""give all the toys... to the little rich boys""... i dunno. im glad i listened to the jam. they are/were (whatever) cool. ok and you should listen to the ramones, too... they are rad"
4,Excellent Book About a Serious Topic,This book should be read by every American in order to understand the political scene and its hidden agendas currently operating.
1,defective,"the book arrived in time, ""But"" each page detaches from spine upon turning. Problem in manufacture. Bloody nuisance!..My copy cannot be the only example.."
4,"Here we are now, entertain us","Alternately playful and earnest, erudite and silly, these are delightful essays and perfect vacation reading. Most of the authors use this as an opportunity for some sort of memoir, some are deft at film criticism, some spend too much time laboriously recounting a plot, but the vast majority of the pieces are astutely observed, unpretentious, and immediately likeable."
4,"Brief but well-done, enlightening documentary","This documentary is one of the very few available on the often-silenced subject of the transgendered hijra devotees of India and is excellent for use in classes on gender, sexuality, and religion. My only complaint is that it is too brief, but I still recommend it highly. Blackthorn Krause, CA"
4,Nice Necklace for Boy,"Not too girly, just right as a confirmation gift for our nephew. He liked it and wears it frequently. Thanks."
1,Just Too Boring...(Sorry),"There's no other way to say it, I had to struggle to finish this book - and this was before I got even half way through it."
2,"Pick a side, already!","The Christian parts are distracting and gratuitous. The author is straddling the border between two different types of stories, and the book suffers because he fails to choose a side. Either the book can be about a man who is coming to terms with his life, or it can be about a man who is coming to terms with his God. Either one would have been stronger than this, a story about a religious man who retreats into a fantasy world."
1,Beatles' Song Was Better,"The story was confusing, the Christian aspects served no purpose, and the characters were not developed so that we could like them."
1,Great product terrible support,"I am compelled to express my total frustration at the support offered with this product. I have taken 4 hours at National phone rates to get through to technical support, who tell me their stats say there is a max 6 mins waiting time. I told them that this stat has just taken 4 hours to get through!! If you need support, go elsewhere until this company can sort its phonelines out - even if you have to pay for it, at least you can get it. I have voiced my opinions directly to David Soares, vice president of the European arm of the company (my apologies if this is not entirely correct,) my guess is that little will change,"
2,For OVERSIZED Binders. Will not fit in a regular binder.,"The quality of these looks great, but I didn't even open the package after I received it. These do NOT fit in a standard binder. You'll need a special ""Oversize Binder."""
2,Weak Kaurismaki,"This black and white road movie by Aki Kaurismaki (about an hour long) about two working class men from Finland travelling by road through Finland with two women (a Russian and an Estonian, don't these two people hate each other?) is very uneven. Filmed in the early 90s, it is among Kaurismaki's weakest work, showing a lot of his peculiar obsessions (vintage cars, rock music, cigarettes, smoky bars) but without much of any payoff for the viewer. Nothing much happens and nothing seems to matter much. However, it's good to see the late great actor (and Kaurismaki's regular) Matti Pellonpaa as well as a younger Kati Outinen."
2,Pillows Very Firm,"The pillows I ordered appear to be of good quality, but are too firm for me to sleep on. I would not suggest these pillows for someone who prefers a soft pillows. As I don't use these pillows when I sleep, I can't attest to their effectiveness in preventing dust mites."
3,Only mediocre,"I enjoy this comedian, but there is not enough substance for a whole book. I gave the book to a friend who also has free association humor."
2,Disappointing,"John Hodgeman is great when he's on the Jon Stewart show. The book, sadly, is boring even as bathroom reading."
2,Hard to follow,This was not the easiest book to read and follow. In fact someone stole it from me and I am glad they did.
1,"Basically the same stuff, some of it amusing and most not, contained in his second book.","John Hodgman appears to be a genuinely funny man during his appearances on ""The Daily Show"" with the sainted Jon Stewart.Then why is this book so disappointing? (I confess I only read the first 60 or so pages before punting)Because if you've read ""More Information Than You Require"", you've gotten all the available juice out of this piece of fruit. Author Hodgman simply does not deviate: the first book is the same as the second.I enjoyed ""More Information Than You Require"", as you can see by my review, though it certainly got tired about the time that Hodgman listed, over several pages, potential names of something or other. Talk about needing an editor of funny business, John.Not recommended unless you have plenty of free time. And even then......"
1,Painful,"I special ordered this book based on a glowing review from a good friend.I have decided to ask this friend never to recommend anything to me ever again.I didn't laugh at anything in this book. I smiled once or twice at certain parts. The author has a troubling obsession with werewolves and hobos that is tedious and fairly juvenile. The only person laughing is John Hodgman as he sleeps on a giant pile of money from people foolish enough to buy into the hype, and the publisher that was double-dog-dared to print it."
4,Eclectic humor,"If you like odd, esoteric bits of factoids--or, in Hodgman's case, fictionoids--this book will delight you. The two people in our family who read it (a college student and his mom) each enjoyed about three quarters of it. Neither of us could see the point in the heavy emphasis on hobos, however. Amusing and light, an excellent choice for bathroom reading."
4,Fun time,Heard this book reviewed on NPR and couldn't resist. My (grown) kids loved it. Recommend leaving it on the kitchen table to be read bits at a time.
5,"If you enjoy random, absurdist humor, this book is for you...","Don't pay attention to the bad reviews and the bellowings that there are fraudulent positive reviews here; this book is great. I laughed so hard when I read it, I was tearing up. I also couldn't put it down the first time around.Like I said in the title, you really have to have a sense for this kind of humor in order to enjoy this book as much as you should. That's not to make the book an elitest venture by any means, however. Just be aware that this isn't in the vein of ""The Family Circus"" or ""Chicken Soup for the *BLANK* Soul""."
5,John Hodgman is a better choice,"I was lucky to be able to download the audiobook for free from iTunes. Based on this, I will gladly buy audiobook versions of any of Hodgman's future books.Hodgman's voice (and Jonathan Coulton's music) are a great addition to this material. If you like the book, you will like the audiobook."
3,Hodgman is Funny,"I like Hodgman's humor and enjoyed this book quite a bit. I also would recommend Lloyd Dangle's latest book, ""Troubletown Told You So: Comics That Could've Saved Us From this Mess.""Troubletown Told You So: Comics that Could've Saved Us from this Mess"
2,Take the $14 you would spend on this book and eat out instead,I'm sure there are people out there who would enjoy this book but I am not one of them.There are the occasional humorous moments but for the most part it's just not worth the the money and most assuredly not worth the time spent to read it.Maybe if I'd picked it up on the bargin table at some book store for 2 or 3 bucks . . .
1,Not what I thought it would be.,"This was a definate waste of my money. For an educated person, the author writes like a 10 year old. Not funny and not worth the money. If you have more than a 9th grade education you will probably find this ""dull""."
1,Unusual and dull,"I did not enjoy this book and did not think it even remotely funny. Parts of it--especially the werewolf tables--were obviously more intelligent than I could understand.This is very obscure humor and I would only recommend for those who have a ""different"" sense of humor."
1,What? Is this supposed to be funny?,"Another east coast know it all making fun of the things Americans hold dear, even 9-11.Not funny, not even close!Parody and send up is funny when it is not mean spirited, for example, Monty Python or W.C Fields. Hodgman is not funny.Don't waste your money!"
1,Zero stars; I want my money back,This is one of the worst books I have ever read in my life and is not even remotely funny; think of watching the dullest speeches you ever saw on C-SPAN followed by Garrison Keillor on his worst off-day after you exceeded your Prozac dose and you will get the idea. Avoid at all costs.
2,The Cover says it all...,"The Introduction (Which is reproduced on the dust jacket) is the most amusing portion of this rather dull book. It seems that the author once read ""1066 and All That"" and believed that he could recreate a similar work of nonsensical ramblings out of whole cloth. While I admire the effort, Hodgman falls very, very short of the goal.What makes works such as ""1066"" so amusing is not that they are a collection of nonsense, but that they reflect our sometimes twisted view of the world. ""1066"" is brilliant because it captures that sense of thinking that you know it all, when you in fact do not. Hodgman's work boils down to a man with too much time on his hands who has convinced himself that he is really quite clever."
3,funny but not the best,"I thought this book would be so much funnier than it really is. I like Hodgman and I expected more. I did not read every little bit of it, especially the 700 or so hobo names, and if I had read it ahead of time, I would not have bought it."
1,Rubbish :(,"This is simply the worst book I've bought in a long time. I didn't find it remotely funny. Previously I've bought other books by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert and found them to be hilarious so I expected this to contain the same kind of clever satire that the other two authors have used to great effect. Instead I get a list of a couple of hundred hobo names and a phases of the moon chart for werewolf transformations.Seriously, I appreciate that you've done some ads for Apple and get a semi-regular stint on the Daily Show but this is just cack. Awful, I want my $5 back."
2,Dull book. Bogus reviews.,"This book has nothing going for it. It's not funny or interesting. It demonstrates almost no literary talent. Trying to read it was a complete waste of my time. Its only virtue is that it is mercifully brief. For that alone, I'm awarding it 2 stars. By my count, I have now doubled the number of 2-star reader reviews. That alone should tell you something about many of the 5-star reviews on Amazon.If it doesn't, try this: to date, 61% of 38 reviews have 5 stars, and 24% have 1 star. Only 16% of the reviews fall somewhere in between. We have been spammed."
1,Get the book NOT the audio book,"The book is a gem; however, the audio book seems to be the wrong medium for Mr. Hodgman's expertise, which is most enlightening, entertaining, and educational indeed."
2,"Hum on my balls, sir.","Mr. Hodgman, you are not funny. I will not go to NYC because of the chance I may actually get caught in an elevator with you...That thought alone is frightening enough to keep me from gettting any sleep. Thanks alot, Johnny. Your style of humor is boredom. I could not even put up with reading it on the toilet. Did you just make all your connections first before farting this one out there. Fie on you JH, fie. You know what's better than your book? THis:Life Begins..."
2,"A giggle, now and again","My apologies to the author, but I just didn't find this book as amusing as previous reviewers have. I think it falls short of capturing the deadpan, comedic delivery that is John Hodgman. I'd love to hear it read by Mr. H as an audiobook! My ""inner voice"" just isn't up to the task of doing his work justice."
3,better than most,"This is a book that tries to be peculiar and funny and succeeds most of the time. Unfortunately a lot of funny ideas get a bit overdone, and in the end, I was quite glad to be finished with it and moving on (especially the hoboes!). This is a talent to be watched, if only on the Daily Show as the resident expert."
4,good for on the bowl,"This is not a book to read cover to cover. You read a little, pinch a loaf, laugh, then wipe. In this fashion you will get months of enjoyment from this read."
1,worthless,"After being bombarded with emails to buy this book, I bought it. I wish I hadn't. Maybe somebody finds this funny but it sure isn't me nor was it funny to any of the people I loaned it to. I am hopeful that the emails have stopped. I certainly hope that the emaileers are happpy with the review they inisted I write. I bought, I hated, I wrote."
1,RETREADED AND UNFUNNY,"I bought this book hoping for some cheer through the holidays. I had seen the author on THE DAILY SHOW and thought it might be fun. I was wrong. Most of his concepts are worn and tired. For anyone who has ever been to a comedy club, you'll recognize the ""jokes"" and gags. Nothing new is created and, in fact, many of the premises were funnier when the comedians told them and are somewhat diluted here. It is said that one cannot copyright a joke. What a shame! Were there such laws, John Hodgman would be in debt to a few dozen people who had the original thoughts. And is it me, or does this guy think he is smarter than the rest of us? Mr. Hodgman, please don't write another book until you have an original idea....or be kind enough to credit the people you ""borrow"" from."
1,AWFUL !!!!!!!!,"I ordered this book from my library based on a book review that I had read. It is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. There is no point to it whatsoever. The contents are just rantings of some guy whom no one has ever heard of. The book jacket has the worst typeface ever and you actually have to start reading the book to figure out what it's about. I'll sum it up for you and save you time: it is about NOTHING anyone cares about. Do you really need to waste your time reading about 700 hobo names? What is so freaking funny about that?? Shockingly enough, again the answer is NOTHING. I regret the gas I wasted to get me to the library to pick up this book."
1,Not very interesting,"I like the author, and I am intrigued with the Apple ads, but I haven't been able to read more than a few parts of a few pages as the book is just not very interesting."
4,"funny, but not for everyone","This is one of those books I really enjoy, but I can't read too much at one sitting. The tone is very dry, and much of the humor is based on nonsense, but there are some repeating themes that help hold the work together. I'm reminded a bit of Mark Leyner, though Leyner's style is much more hyperactive. If you like this book the McSweeneys collection 'Created in Darkness by Troubled Americans' might also appeal to you. The tone is similar, and some sections of the book are very funny."
4,Makes-a-me-laugh,"Absurdly dry and funny. In a similar manner to his schtick on ""The Daily Show,"" Hodgman throws facts into a blender with ludicrous tidbits from his imagination. As I was telling a friend recently, I now fear inclusion in Modern Jackass Magazine (see ""This American Life"") if and when I accidentally insert some of Hodgman's ""facts"" into casual conversation. If that happens, however, the consequence will have been worth the action."
3,"Funny in Parts, Tedious in Others","I enjoyed the book - it's a quick read and I found it very original and inventive throughout. However, original and inventive are not always the same as funny. Some parts were very funny (TR and the lobsters, the Hobos seizing the government) but other long stretches fell flat."
3,Teenage Frankenstein,"Slow Exploitation Cinema starters. As the movies' unfold, all the things that you would expect to happen, do.Some good old time small southern community humor. A good choice for fans of the original American Graffiti (1973).These films are worth checking out only if you like the Exploitation genre."
2,Not long enough,"I bought the bottoms for my husband who is 6'2"" and they only went half way up his behind. I bought a large which is his correct size but they just weren't long enough. It's too bad because they were thick and looked really nice. I wouldn't recommend these bottoms for a tall person."
4,Polypro bottoms,this is a good product--very warm--used it this wknd on the farm (temps in 30's)---but it runs a little on small side-----order a size larger than you think you need
2,"""They do not move with you""","when i received these bottoms, I didnt expect much because polypro is plastic basically. I dont blame the seller for the quality. These pants do not flex with your movement and they were a bit snug on the legs. The one great thing about these is they make a great wind block. I bought these mainly for warmth but they are not flexible enough to move with your body. they kept puklling on my knees. They also make me sweat but its no different than wearing a plastic trash bag. The vender sent them very quickly and I was pleased at the quick response. i just did not like the quality and flexibility. I wish they made a really warm pair of these undergarments that was really warm and breathed."
5,An extraordinary voice,"The Best of Izzy hightlights an extraordinary and beautiful voice that I would like to hear much more often. This collection of art songs and arias is lovely, powerful and at times haunting. ...a great find!"
2,Authentic Gypsy Village music,"This music sounds as though it was ""live"" recorded in the villages....Good if you are into 'real authentic folk music'.. Some tracks good for belly-dancing...Not for those less enthused."
1,Pretty but Smelly,"I love the look of this wastebasket and it was perfect in my tropical decorated bathroom. BUT, it smelled musty. I left it in the sun daily for two weeks and it still smelled so I bought some clear acrylic spray and sprayed it inside and out. It still smells (but not as badly). Right now, after a month, it is on the shelf outside the garage and I am hoping it will eventually degas whatever it is and be able to come inside. It might work in a larger room with more air circulation but in a small bathroom the smell is not acceptable. After a couple of months on my garage shelf it has now lost the smell and is back in the bathroom as the perfect little tropical trash can that I wanted - just about 6 months later."
5,Must Read,"With the currently renewed interest in Cuba after President Carter's visit in May 2002, this title becomes even more essential. The author covers in brilliant detail how the Cuba of today came to be. In this book, the reader will learn how Castro transformed the free and prosperous Cuba of 1958 into the poverty-stricken dictatorship of today. Overnight, this book has been transformed from a historical text to a guidebook for future US relations with Cuba."
2,"FDR, ER & Campo","I was excited when I first saw this book advertised. Anyone who has studied the Roosevelts knows the fundamental emotional foundation this island provided the family. However, when I began to read the book, I quickly became disgruntled. There was little to no new information, insight or perspective offered. The author seems to mainly cover the same formulaic roads covered before-- early marriage, polio, governor, president, & Eleanor on her own. The only difference was this books focuses on those same paths through the lens of Campobello. The problem, besides offering little new, is this lens is restrictive, rather than encompassing. If you're looking for an introduction to the Roosevelts, this may be a good selection. However, if you have studied this couple with any kind of attention, nothing profound or enlightning is likely to be found here."
1,False advertising and claims from Pro Therapy Supplies,NO STAND!!!!! I ordered a full flexible spine model from Pro Therapy Supplies for my practice. The description clearly states the model comes with the metal stand. The spine is as advertised but the company did not send the metal stand with the spine. Now I have a spine model lying in my office chair. ThanksFull Spine Model w/Femoral Heads - W/Femoral Heads
3,Revolutionary Surfing of the Fifties,This comedy-wrapped thriller is as much entertaining as a movie of teen characters played by actors in their thirties might be.Six-pack surfing boys are passionately kissing hardly distracted by fellow groupies while mysterious murders occur on a beach they surf offshore.Extremely sexy and lovemaking-sick even today produce was surely too popular half century ago at creation.
3,Too Biographical,"Herman did a good job with this book, and sure crammed a lot of information into it. However, biographies have never been my thing, and Herman spend just to much time relating the play by play, and not how it all comes together. But, it certainly provides some Pro-McCarthy balance, esepcially against such anti-Anti-Communist books such as 'Many are the Crimes'"
2,Great theory but waaaay too long,"I've met Arthur Herman before and he's a great guy but so I mean this in the nicest way. It put me to sleep.His theory is a bold and very engaging one, McCarthy was right! I agree with this theory and read his book hoping page after page to get to the good stuff. But it never came. Instead he wastes hundreds of pages on tangent issuses and a rehash of what we already know about McCarthy.He does have some great dacts about how poor McCarthy has been distorted by the media, but these facts are few and fleeting.If you hope to get a different view of McCarthy you will be disapointed."
1,A Bunch Of Conservative Claptrap,"The majority of McCarthy biographies have been written from a left-wing point of view (and face it, why would conservatives want to bring McCarthy's name up?). But Herman's book swings the pendulum just as far, if not farther, in the other direction. Nearly every McCarthy action is excused or apologized for, no matter how loathsome. Nearly every action taken against McCarthy is because McCarthy's opponents were all Communists or sympathizers, or had relatives who were Communists or sympathizers (just as bad, according to the author). For a balanced account, Thomas Reeves' 1982 biography remains the standard."
3,"As the Man, So the Book","Among Arthur Herman's arguments in this fascinating, frustrating book is that Joe McCarthy had the right idea - that Communism in America, and American liberals' blindness to it, was a grave threat - but that he was unable to competently pursue that idea. Alas, the same is to some extent true of Herman. His previous works - particularly ""The Idea of Decline in Western History"" - were rigourous, thought-provoking and polished. ""Joseph McCarthy"", however, shows many signs of having been pushed out the door much too soon. Grammatical errors, poorly phrased sentences, and simple mistakes abound. Furthermore, Herman goes to such effort to provide context that McCarthy himself becomes somewhat obscured. This is a great pity, for Herman has a very interesting case to make; yet without considerable editing, ""Joseph McCarthy"" cannot be said to be a success."
3,"Fair, balanced accounting of political career of McCarthy","Arthur Herman's latest book reexamines the legacy of Joe McCarthy and he doesn't pull too many punches! His criticism of McCarthy ranting about alleged conspiracies is fair. i do like the fact that he criticizes McCarthy without the insufferable whining obfuscating of the facts, which is common in the liberal academic environment of today. He does take other authors and scholars to task on what they have written about McCarthy, which I liked. Having not read the entire record of Senator McCarthy before now, I will admit that I maintained a more open mind about McCarthy than other readers and scholars familiar with the entire record of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Arthur Herman does need better assistance in editing his next book because I found grammatical errors in this book!"
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,"Thoroughly researched and excellently written, this book is a great read.It gives a distinct picture of Joe McCarthy, and also educates the reader about the events occurring.GRADE: A++"
3,Good Accounting of McCarthy era,"While I agree with other reviewers that this book is an even handed accounting of a very turbulent - and misunderstood - era of American history, David Oshinsky's Conspiracy So Immense still remains the standard for which all McCarthy biographies are measured. It's unfortunate that much of this book - or atleast a good portion - seems to come from Oshinsky's excellent work without proper accreditation. Read A Conspiracy So Immense prior to purchasing this."
1,Not relevant to the real (dirty) world of plumbing,"I am a professional handyperson (eight years) and am always looking for books to improve my knowledge. This is one of the worst I've every made the mistake of spending money on. If you follow the photos and advice you'll never get your hands dirty and never meet a filthy plumbing problem. Rex Cauldwell writes the best books on plumbing and electrical, bar none."
2,Don't be a sucker,"It's not that Mr. Cohen's advice isn't helpful. He has some good tips on marketing and promoting your music but the CD-ROM contains a PDF file of about 90 pages of material plus a few freebies. What's even worse is that he markets a hard copy of the same title with the addition of ""Vol. 2"". You would think that this would be all new material but it is essentially the same as the CD-ROM. It's about a 70 page booklet. If you saw this in a book store you wouldn't pay $20 for it. I should have been warned by the ""Get Rich Quick"" type title. Mr. Cohen appeals to our greed to move his overpriced products. I hope amazon.com will investigate this matter and give more product description so others won't waste their money buying two versions of the same book."
5,An asset to the industry.,"I've been in this business for the past four years, and I saw this book on a friend of mine's desk about a month ago. After reading this book, I am absolutely hooked! I've been in the buisness for four years, and Ty here actually revealed some tricks of the trade that even I didn't know. If you want to get into this risky business- get this book first. I'm buying my copy now."
1,Don't get burned on this one!,All 4 burners rust out within 2 years and are not covered under warranty.
3,The product was as described,"My only negatives with the product is that it does not come with the gojo soap and you have to purchase it separately. Secondly the packaging is not great to be used as a gift, as it just comes in a amazon box with a plastic bag covering the unit. (No manufacturing packaging or instructions)."
3,A Grim Mystery,"A grim mystery set in the Everglades of Florida, Parrish's super hero, a black detective named Kincaid, fights the nightmares of murder, human slavery, kidnapping as well as his own inner unsolved demons. A moving story that keeps the reader turning the pages. The character descriptions are convincing and draw you into the adventure.This is a fast moving ""who done it"" with a psychological twist and a sneak view of the capabilities of the human to do horrific things to other humans."
3,Please get the right movie reviewers.,This is not the film with William Forsythe and Kari Wuhrer.Please read the credits before you review.
4,Pretty good actually,"I caught this movie a few months back on HBO, I was expecting it to be a T&A fest but it wasn't. It is funny in parts, though the story is thin this movie will still entertain you."
4,Study and keep thyself pure......,"Emphasizes the importance of awareness in matters visible and invisible. Ignorance is not bliss. A true disciple must be alert and wise, fully equipped in knowledge and love. Spiritual growth is essential on the path. Book covers many areas of thought....is a treatise to be studied not just casually read."
4,13 Blue Magic Lane...,"Blue Magic is a true 'soul' group! After 30 years of listening to them, I am finally collecting their albums on CD! The standout track is 'What's come over me' (featuring Margie Joseph). The interaction between Ms. Joseph and Blue Magic's lead singer was something that stuck back in '75 (my senior year of high school!). Another special track on this album is 'Chasing Rainbows.' The price is right, I invite you to get ourself a copy and see what 70's music was all about! Blue magic was the 'real deal!' Four stars!!"
2,Timer is way too polite for me,"I bought this timer because I've been really impressed with the quality of the OXO products. While the OXO timer is very sturdily made, the beeper is way too reserved. When I'm cooking or otherwise using a timer, I want a loud obnoxious ""pay attention to meee"" timer that brings me running from the next room. I have an old Sunbeam timer that does just that."
2,I'd like it if it worked.,"I had one of these for a few months, and setting the time was extremely difficult. The teeny button you push to activate that function is not very reliable. I had all the troubles mentioned in other reviews with the buttons, but I grew fond of the timer, saw it as a bit cranky, but helpful. Nice looking, plus the numeric pad is nice. But recently the timer function froze and none of the buttons would register. I kept pressing the button that switches between clock and timer, but nothing would happen. I exchanged it for another one, and the button that sets the time would not work so I couldn't set the time. I don't care about the time function, but the confusion of having a clock in my kitchen set at an incorrect time sounded precarious. I'm returning it."
1,not recommend,Display is difficult to read and the buttons to do not provide provide tactile response. It has a nice Stainless steel like finish and is heavy with a non-slip bottom so I'm using it as paper weight.
3,Could be better,"After a dunking accident wiped out a previous LCD timer that I had in my kitchen, purchase of a new timer was needed. I found the OXO Digital Timer at a local housewares store.While OXO generally has good quality products, a number of things turned me off from the digital timer. The quality of the buttons on the timer is lacking. You are never certain that you've pressed the button because there is neither tactile or audio feedback. (Previous experience with other kitchen timers/probe thermometers always had an audio confirmation when a button was successfully pressed).While cooking, I don't want to be distracted having to stare at the timer to make sure that I actually started it. I just want to hear it go.It works fine, I'd just rather hear the buttons be pressed as I go along."
1,No,"This timer feels sturdy, well built. So that's a good point.But, as mentioned in another review, the buttons are hard to activate, especialy the funky-shaped-but-inefficient clear/memory and the stop/start buttons; which are the ones you will use most. And, there is no sound confirming when a button is pressed, so you often have to press 2 or 3 times instead of 1.The memory function is useful. It simply reset to the last time setting used.The display is bad.It is small, and is below surface. So when viewed from an angle (which is almost always), you can only see part of the numbers. You can clearly see an illustration of what I mean on the image of the product on this site.I could not recommend.Buy something else."
1,As bad as it gets,"This timer is useless. Very small recessed display that's hard as hell to read. A display that reverts back to the time if you don't push ""start"" within a requisite number of seconds. (The ""time"" function includes seconds, which turns out to be very confusing--You look at the display and think the timer is timing something when it's not. It's just ticking away seconds.) Small unfriendly buttons that don't always register your pushing them, including the start/stop buttons don't reliably respond when you push them.BEST FOR: Hucking at annoying house guests. (So I guess I was wrong; it's not useless.)WORST FOR: Timing things in the kitchen.Oxo clearly doesn't have a clue.I quickly replaced this piece of junk with this (great) West Bend timer:West Bend Timer, White"
1,Terrible design,"I am very disappointed with this timer. Most important is that the display is small and hard to read from an angle. In the kitchen I move around a lot and I find that I frequently want to check the remaining time. It's hard for me to read. I also don't like the feel of the buttons. I understand why some reviewers like the numerical pad. I hate it.The Oxo goal was clearly to have a simple, robust, easy to use product, but I'm very disappointed with the result.As an alternative I highly recommend the Thermoworks triple timer, available from their website."
1,major let down,"I like OXO products. I have several. But this timer is a miserable hunk of machinery that destroys my faith in humanity.Ok not quite that bad, but close. The buttons have to be pressed directly in the center and very HARD in order to program it. It seems to switch between clock and timer mode without a reason.The other thing I don't like about it is that their isn't an accompanying ""beep"" when you press the buttons. This fact in combination with the difficulty of pressing the buttons brews up a whole lot of trouble.[I have the white version, not the silver, but I imagine the mechanics are the same."
1,Oxo really dropped the ball on this one,"Like others have already said, this timer feels heavy and substantial, it is not. Several times I set the timer, only to return a few minutes later to find that the start/stop button hadn't really been pressed. After 4 months the button stopped working all together.Being a fairly resourceful person, I decided to take it apart and see if I couldn't clean up the unit, but no dice. The only way to get the unit apart was to destroy the rubber seal around the bottom which had been glued on.Sorry Oxo, but you really messed up on this one."
2,"Tiny, fidgety buttons difficult to press","My title says it all.Agree with most other reviews. It is heavy and solidly built. Digits are small and not easy to read. My biggest gripe is the tiny buttons - you really have to press down hard for them to register. When you have messy fingers while cooking, operating this timer requires significant effort."
1,Wish I had read these reviews before I bought,"I use to think that Oxo made quality products, so I bought this timer with no hesitation to replace an ugly, clunky, huge timer I have in my kitchen. This pretty, little Oxo timer is now in the drawer. The instructions were missing, so I thought it was me and not the timer. I decided to look for them online and saw all the one star reviews. Had I known about all the bad experiences people are having with this piece of junk, I would have left it in the store. I'm having the same headaches with this weakling Oxo timer. For $14.95 I would have found a cuter paper weight. I'm now distrustful of Oxo products, they put out garbage as well as decent products."
3,OK overall.,"I have had this timer for a few years, and it has worked well overall, no problems, but a couple frustrations. I bought this particular timer because the face is more horizontal, it looked like it would be stable sitting on the countertop, and I thought I would not have to actually pick it up to set it but could just quickly press the buttons, hit start, and go. It sort of works that way, but you have to press the buttons fairly firmly or the numbers won't register, and when you do this the timer sometimes slides on the countertop so that you either have to stop and hold it with your other hand, or slow down and very carefully press the buttons just enough to input the number but not hard enough to make it keep sliding back as you push the buttons. Secondly, the buttons are a little small and you have to press them close to the center of each one to make sure the number registers on the counter."
2,Could be a lot better,"Hard to believe this is from OXO, the people who usually come up with a good design.Pro's - none I can think ofCon's - difficult to read the time, the number buttons are to small, the stop/start and clear buttons are larger but if you don't press them in the center, they don't register"
1,Waste of money,"This timer stopped working within 2 weeks of purchase. The reset button at the top that allows the user to set clock time and timing period is tiny and difficult to use at best; after two weeks this button on my timer just stopped working. I liked the design of this timer otherwise; but without any way to reset clock and timing period, it's of no use."
1,"Terrible design, broke within a year","This timer is terrible. It's difficult to use, seems to run non-stop (I have not figured out a way to turn it off without removing the battery), hard to see, isn't magnetized AND the noise notification stopped working a few weeks ago. The digial read still works (however, very inefficiently) but the timer doesn't buzz anymore. How useless! A complete waste of money and energy."
1,Worthless and worse,"This product is more than useless - you'll waste your own time trying to use it. I threw mine in the trash after just five minutes, once I figured out how limited it is.Where to start? Illegible dial, minuscule ""clock/timer"" button, small digital time input buttons, useless clock. Takes longer to set the timer than it takes to time the food.Oxo makes great products. They also put their name on crap. This is not one of their great ones."
3,"basic plastic tarp, confusing deal","The tarps are OK. They are your basic cheap blue plastic tarp, which is as represented (Uh, other than quantity that is). What was very upsetting to me is that I bought them because they were sooo cheap, 18 tarps for a very low price, the price in large part motivated my selection. What do you suppose was my reaction when they arrived (I bought two 'packs of eighteen'), to find that there were only two tarps, one per order! Upon contacting the seller, they contacted me promptly and offered to sell me the two tarps at their cost, no where near the low price it should have been for the eighteen. I accepted, and am content, but if you read that they are eighteen per pack, buyer beware!"
1,Completely archaic but may have historical or humor value,"Printed in 1994, on the cusp of the internet era, virtually nothing in this book is relevant today. Mainly provides info on logging on to sex-oriented dial-up bulletin boards, most of which no longer exist. However it may have some amusement or historical value, reflecting the pre-history of sex on the internet."
1,Do not buy!,"After 2 weeks of using the lock , the key snapped in half. Luckily I had a spare. 2 Weeks later it snappe din half again and half of it was stuck inside the lock, even after I changed my style of opening it. The lock gets stiff at the very hint of rain. Do not buy."
2,Key broke off in the lock,"The lock itself served its purpose, but the key design is terrible. Not only is it hard to fit in the lock to where you practically have to force it in, it's so poorly made that it can actually rip in half. So thanks, Bell, for that second key. I guess you knew we'd need it eventually. What happens when that one breaks too? Don't buy this product."
1,Cheap piece of junk! Same key works for most!,"I bought this at walmart at the start of the college school year. Not only did the inside of the lock CALCIFY and RUST so bad that you have to hit the key in with a rock just to turn it (note: the key has bent so bad sometimes its nearly broke off in the lock), but the key works on half of the other bikes Ive seen on campus with the same lock! Bell clearly uses only a handful of different lock mechanisms so forget cutting it... PEOPLE CAN JUST UNLOCK IT WITH THEIR KEY!Im going with a combo now instead of a key and definitely NO MORE BELL PRODUCTS!"
3,Not great,"I bought this lock at Walmart a while ago to lock up my bike on a University campus and around. I didn't get my bike stolen like some of the other unfortunate reviewers (probably because my bike just wasn't worth it), but I do still have some complaints.First of all, I didn't want to use the bulky LED key, so I used the thinner one. This was a mistake. After about a year of use, the lock became rusted and stiff, and after a few months of having to push the key hard and jiggle it to turn the lock, the key casing just broke right off: it's not metal all the way through, and the ""head"" is just plastic. So, I not only had a really hard time turning the key without a head, but I had no way of securing the key to a keyring. Long story short, it's a miracle I didn't lose this stub of a key for the remaining 6 months of use, and it was a major pain besides.If you have a cheap bike or live in a low-crime area, get a better cable lock for the same price. If you have a nice bike, buy a better lock."
4,Sturdy indeed,"I bought this when I bought my woman's bike, and made a mistake. It is definitely for use on man's bikes without a doubt. It made a great gift to the spouse and is really strong and trustworthy. The price is right and it is really practical."
3,Get what you pay for.,This lock does the job. It is a good U-Lock so thieves can not cut through it. However it is cheap. On one night with rain and then a freeze the lock had ice in it and the key would not turn. I had to twist the key for 10 minutes to get it to work. Not good for use in cold weather but if you want a cheap U-Lock this is a great buy.
2,Broken keys,"I felt secure with the lock, but the key was tough to get into the keyhole. A bit of oil would help, but it was still a bad design and should not have gotten stuck so often. Unfortunately, the key is extremely flimsy and bends if you try to jiggle it into the lock, and then breaks off at the bend. Happened to both my keys within 2 days, and now my bike is locked and I've got no keys."
1,Jams In Winter,"I live in a low-crime area, so I'm not too worried about someone using bolt cutters to steal my bike. However, This lock doesn't work well in winter. It jams up, and it's very difficult to insert the keys. And then, once you get the keys in, It's a battle just to turn them.It's comforting to know that if it does eventually lock up, I can remove the lock with bolt cutters. My advice: don't buy this one."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"My bike got stolen with 2 of these locks on it. Security cameras caught a thug in a hoodie (of course, not identifiable) with bolt-cutters. Took all of 10 seconds. They were kind enough to leave one of the locks. In pieces.If you stole my bike, I hope you get hit by a truck on it."
1,Same complaint as others - used this lock and my bike was stolen.,"Several others have said it, but it bears repeating. This lock cannot be trusted to protect your bike.I locked my bike just outside my door. Left for work and the bike was there. Came home from work and the bike was gone. Only had the bike for a few weeks. I learned my lesson.I'll be getting a much tougher lock (actually locks - at least two different ones) for my next bike."
1,bike stolen,"i suppose i should be greatful that it didn't get stolen sooner, but judging from the marks left on the only remaining part of my bike, this u-lock, it looked like it was pretty easy to pop open. next time i will spend the extra money to buy a heavier duty lock."
1,Worked for 3 days then the Keys stuck,"If I could give no stars, I would. I bought this lock and initially it was working perfectly, as advertised. The crossbar was coming off nicely and it was easy to use. Then it rained. Granted, I live in New Orleans so it rains a lot. But as a result of the rain, some of the interior components rusted and it was dang near impossible to insert my key, and once I got it in, I could hardly get it out. I literally had to ask for assistance to remove my key! I thought that maybe by turning the lock upside down and draining the water, this would help. It did initially until it rained again, then it took me between 8 and 10 minutes to get the lock off on two occasions. I then decided enough was enough. I threw the lock away not only because of the time issue, but because it bent one key beyond use and the second was permanently stripped and couldn't turn the lock anymore. Good thing I had the common sense to put my bike in my room after this."
3,Mounting the lock on the bike when not in use,"I just got one of the u locks. I didn't open the package yet, because the way they show it mounted on the bike would be interfered with by the water bottle. Any thoughts please?Ron"
3,Heavy,It's a little bit heavy but I guess you do not have to worry about someone taking a hack saw to it unless they have all day. It comes with hardware to attach it to your bike but I just keep it in my bag.
3,OK,"This phone is about what one would expect for the price. The sound quality is fine, and the caller ID stores enough numbers that you could be gone away for two weeks and know who all called. My only complaint is that the caller ID screen is difficult to read except when viewed straight on in good light."
3,Not bad for price.,"I bought this phone because of the price and the caller ID. I have had it for a month now and haven't had a whole lot of problems. It is true that all the lights don't work on the buttons, but the sound has been fine for me. As a matter of fact the normal sound is plenty loud, and I haven't heard any music yet. I read the other reviews and was worried about this. I think it is a good second phone."
1,Built in radio receiver!,I just picked up this phone today and it pulls in two radio stations! Advice for buyers in Manhattan: stay away from this phone. I tried both near and away from my windows. One station came in loud & clear while the other was a bit faded. Very annoying!
2,conair corded phone,"Its an ok phone. The caller I.D. numbers when they call are way too small. I would'nt buy this phone again. You can hear ok on it, but the caller i. d. is just too small."
4,"So Far, So Good","Actually, I only started using this shampoo about 3 weeks ago, and I am not using it as frequently as recommended during the first month of usage. However, I did notice from the very time that I used it, my hair seemed different--that is, very improved. I have also noticed that I do seem to not be developing any more bald patches like I was in the past. I will have to give it more time to be able to give a definitive answer concerning its effectiveness with alopecia areata. However, I am very pleased so far. I will probably be able to give you a better answer later."
3,MISFORTUNE,"This is a not-quite-first-person account of an horrific event. The narrative leaves out the trauma but the introduction reminds us of just what went on. It is a story of the strength and resiliency of the human spirit. This is not an historical perspective in the sense that historical events are woven into the tale. Indeed, the young girls are not aware of the larger injustices. But it resonates with today's awfulness in other parts of the world. And it reminds us that the Indians experienced an ethnic cleansing greater than any we have seen."
1,For those who like their pulp to be sci fi noir on CD,"A 5-CD set, a 'techno drama' adventure of Ruby, galactic gumshoe. This is part 1 (one week's worth of shows?) of The Underworld. Each CD is 53-57min.""Ruby stories feature a full cast of actors with sensational sound effects and music. Ruby is audio drama at its finest. Winner of the CPB Silver Award for Technical Achievement and AIR Best Independent Radio Production Award. For a catalog of the complete Ruby adventures, call ZBS at 1-800-662-3345.""The phone# still works (I called on a weekend, and a recording gave their work hours), so if you finish part 1 of this science-fiction-pulp-noir, presumably you can get the rest. It's too over-the-top with the dialog, music, and reading, for my taste."
1,weak release,"in my opinion, of the many wolfgang dauner projects, this is probably his weakest release. it's very short, around 33 minutes. the music is mostly psychedelic rock and experimental jazz. the instrumentals are good, but my problem is with the vocals. the vocals are bad, really bad. dauner, schwab, wittich & weber are all credited with the vocals and none of them can sing. secondly the lyrics are incredibly sophmoric. ""dig my girl"" for instance: dig my girl, dig my wife, dig the rhythm i drive, dig my friends, dig my lips, and dig the estea piece. and the cd ends with a cover version of the beatles ""day in the life"" which is embarrassingly bad. skip this cd entirely and locate his Et Cetera band."
4,It's a pretty good book,I don't read much but I enjoyed this book. It taught me something about another place that I didn't know anything thing about. I would recomend to anyone who had lost their faith in something because it might help.
2,Disjointed plot doesn't satisfy,"I was expecting a lot more from this book. I didn't find it particularly interesting, I never connected with the plot, and I'm not even sure there is a plot. The events are all disjointed and mostly unrelated, I didn't find any ""message"" in it. Praise: could have been worse?"
4,No like the end,"I really did not like the end of this novel. I was expectin a better ending. I do not know, I just did not feel that it filled my expectations about the kind of ending that this author usally gives to his books. It was not espectacular. It let me with a lot of questions that I just woullike to have the answers. who put the paquines?, Was the alcalde o sheriff bad?"
3,A Snapshot,"The initial reaction to reading this short novel is that the author forgot to finish it. The book has a plot and the reader gets drawn into it but the story seems to end ahead of the anticipated conclusion. The reader is left wanting answers and may go away disappointed. However, I believe Garcia Marquez only meant to give us a snapshot in the life of a community in turmoil. I believe he meant for us to be left in the dark. Perhaps he wanted to give an impression of a world where there is always conflict without resolution.This is a well-written book with an interesting cast of characters. It is, nonetheless, a snapshot; not the whole roll of film."
2,Disappointed,The Uncommon Valor series is definitely not as good as the O'Malley Series. They are much slower and the Christian content is much weaker.
5,It is the best series ever,"I own all of her books. The O'Malley series is good, I have the whole series. including this series I recommend it."
3,So-So book,"Lieutenant Gracie Yates is a F/A-18 Hornet pilot. Major Bruce Stanton is a Pararescue Jumper. Those they are almost alway in different locations, they still find time to connect and to fall in love. But when Gracie is shot down behind enemy lines, it will be up to Bruce to save her, if he can.I had been waiting a long time to read this book and I have to say that I was a dissapointed. The two main characters just didn't seem to click to me. Fans of Ms. Henderson will more than likely enjoy ""True Valor,"" but I did not"
2,Not an impressive book,"I wasn't a huge fan of this book. I've heard great things about Dee Henderson, however I wasn't overly impressed with the writing. Although it's a sweet story, the love story and plot are very predictable and even cheesy at times. I had a difficult time relating to the characters and really getting into the story. One thing I did appreciate was the book's excellent message."
5,Loved it!,"I saw some other reviews where people said they liked her other books better. This is my favorite Dee Henderson book. I have all of them, but this is the one I like the best. I loved the story and the glimpse into the lives of people in the military. I also really liked how religion is not a heavy handed theme but gracefully woven into the story. The characters' belief helps them to put their lives at risk. It made me personally want to thank all those men and women who serve their country so bravely. And I absolutely loved Bruce's letters. Some reviews didn't like Jill and Wolf's story getting almost equal attention. I liked that. They were interesting characters. I like how Dee Henderson lets you get a full picture of her characters' lives."
2,Slow paced,I have read most of Henderson's books and enjoyed them all except for this one. The story line was mediocre but all the rest is really hard to get through if you are not familiar with these planes. I made my self finish it but I really hope her next one is better. The O'Malley series are so much better! Also try Terri Blackstock's Newpointe series-excellent.
1,Disappointed,"First to start out with, I'd like to say that Dee Henderson is an amazing writer w/ the special gift of writing. I would not recommend this book. The other books she has written (O'Malley Series, Danger in the Shadows) were very well written, w/ the feeling that your can't turn the pages fast enough because it's so good. Unlike the others, True Valor was slow read, and I found my self skimming and completely skipping whole pharagraghs. But even tho I don't recommend this book, the others books by Dee Henderson I HIGHLY recommend."
3,Wait for the next one,"This book may be what you were looking for, but it's not as good as ""True Morality"", where Lt. Joe Bates turns his machine gun on a crowd of American Marines who were preparing to attack a girls' school, after having beaten several of the teachers to death. Lt. Bates reasoned that if raping teenage girls was immoral in southern Alabama, it was also immoral in southern Iraq. Unfortunately, he wins no medals for this."
1,Not as good as the first book in series,"I forced myself to finish this book because I paid for it, but the development of the personal relationships was very slow, and I found myself just skimming through the rest because I found it boring. I read the first book in the series and it was excellent."
3,Decent but disappointing,"I loved Henderson's O'Malley series and True Devotion, but I was disappointed with True Valor. I had a hard time connecting with the characters and relating to the storyline. I was disappointed that there wasn't more elements of suspense, like there was in other of Henderson's novels. Overall, I found this a decent read. The technical stuff regarding the military made it difficult for me to really enjoy."
5,LOVED IT!!!,Gracie and Striker were great characters! The action fast paced and just the right amount of romance and suspense. I've read most of Dee Henderson's books and so far this is my favorite.
2,"OK, but not her best","This is my second Dee Henderson book. My first was #1 in this series and it was awesome! I was a bit disappointed with this book. My husband serves active duty in the US Navy and I had a hard time with the context of all the military mumbo bumbo.It took me a long time to get into the book. It did get better starting around page 100. I usually don't continue a book unless it grabs my attention by the 2nd chapter, but I wanted to finish it so I could move on to #3 which I understand is much better. I'm excited for #4--True Courage to be released!"
5,Great Series,I have enjoyed this series. Always very lifelike. I would recommend them to my friends. Dee Henderson is one of my favorites.
4,You know you need it,"If you're reading this, you probably already know if you need this book. I can add that it is very nicely written (though badly printed and carelessly edited) in a style that is harder than it looks. McIntyre remembers where the pitfalls are and leads the beginner around them without condescension."
4,A Good MSAT General Study Aid,"This is the book that Bobrow gives out to his MSAT seminar students. It was recommended to me by many people. It is extremely helpful to get to kknow some of the subjects that you may not have studied for a while, or subjects you've never studied! Also, ""What Every 5th Grader Should Know"" and ""What Every 6th Grader Should Know"" were extremely helpful in studying literature and history...while Bobrow's book gives history info in outline form (which is sometimes difficult to read), the 5th and 6th grade books give it in a more reader-friendly, textbook format. I read this MSAT book, and I took the MSAT and missed passing on the first try by one point. Don't do what I did and skip any of the essays, even if you have no idea what they are asking!!!"
4,"good source, but shouldn't be the only source","I just took the MSAT and the multiple choice questions in it where harder than on this study guide. Although it gives a nice overview of all the material, it doesn't go on much detail mainly on the history part. That is why you should look further into other sources to be really prepared. It does give a lot of good strategies to take the test. I recommend it, but in addition to other sources."
5,Wall:A World Divided.,"Refreshingly non-Partisan(Considering It is PBS),The Truth about the cold war and the stark reality of victims of communism.GDR from it's misguided inception to it's much deserved end shows the fallacy that socialism is.Hopefully one day Cuba can be Free As well As China,North Korea and Vietnam the last-so-called ""Utopias"" holding out."
4,Nice Collection,This is exactly what I was looking for. The Blu-Ray movies look and sound amazing on my Home Entertainment System. I would recommend this purchase to anyone. I have no regrets with this purchase.
5,blu ray,Great blu ray set for underworld fans. Be prepared to pick up the next movie to add to this set..spoiler alaert
5,Amazing product,Looks and sounds awesome. And at a very good price. I'm not a fan of vampire movies but this story is very well developed.
3,"4th Movie was terrible, but don't let it stop you from watching the other 3","The 4th movie was terrible. It didn't jive with the other three movies at all. it was almost as if the writer was tanked when he wrote it. I couldn't believe it. The other three movies were awesome. I especially liked the 3rd movie which went into the history of the feud, but going from that to a movie based on the cleansing of vampires and lycans - good grief."
4,Great quality,"I recommend this. Outstanding Image and sound. I would improve the box case itself, that can be a lot more fancy."
2,underworld,I liked the fact of having in my possession the entire collection of Underworld but I welcome the know or learn that when tested the first movie of this saga was not spoken in Spanish or at least its subtitle and is entirely in English and other languages and not one that I could understand at least
4,4 in 1 COLLECTION,"this is not special edition, just 4 disc pack in 1 box.but for those who like to collect all episode and cheap then this is the one"
5,I Love Kate!,"Underworld movies are filled with action, and having beautiful Kate Beckinsale in the middle of it all is just Awesome! Four movies, each packaged seperately, and all on Blu-Ray! The latest movie is really action-packed.I like this set a lot!"
4,A dog-saver!!,"I bought this after I adopted a year-old female beagle from a shelter. I didn't know what I had let myself in for!! Beagles, being ""hound"" dogs, march to the beat of a different drummer. . .i.e., their noses!! This book really helped me understand what drives beagles and address the issues of re-training her for her new home. I now keep it as a reference, to remind myself that I was the one needing training in Beagle-speak!!!"
3,Something you should know,"As a coach for 28 years and a head coach for the last 3, I was looking for a way to call No-Huddle offensive plays at the line of scrimmage. On this point, I got some good basic ideas. However, it should be explained to the potential reader that the author's offense is the veer.To utilize the concepts in this book, be ready to adapt a passing/spread type offense accordingly. This can be done, I just think any potential buyer would like to know up front, for what offense the audibles were designed."
2,Sections too large,"This is great padding, but the sections you get once you've got it all together are just too big. You actually need more dividers."
2,An abyssmal failure,"Berry proves through this novel that he clearly should not be writing large works of fiction. Large sections of the book seem to completely ignore the story just so Berry can give an outlet of his feelings. The idea that some of the deep questions Jayber asks really come from a partially educated man who can then turn around and do some incredibly stupid things, like pretend to marry a woman is preposterous. The story is unsatisfying. Few of the characters are endearing, and none of them stick around longer than it takes for Berry to make a supposedly poignant social commentary about people like that. As a read for fun, 2 stars seems generous for such an purposeless, unsatisfying, and disappointing novel."
5,down by the river,"""By order of the author"" Mr. Berry has decreed that anyone attempting to analyze or deconstruct Jayber Crow will be ""banished to a desert island"". I will honor the author and Jayber Crow by simply accepting Jayber as he is. He is the proprietor of the Port William ""underground barbershop"" and the dearest of all the characters in the Port William membership. If you've never read anything by wendell Berry start with Jayber Crow! If you've read everything by Wendell Berry read Jayber Crow! Thankyou, Mr. Berry!"
2,There comes a point in every story.....,"There comes a point in works of fiction where most writers back off of the purely descriptive writing and start moving the plot along. Berry never does that in this book. ""I'm just saying"" for those of you who expect the plot to move the story along that you, the reader, will have to do most of the heavy lifting here.About two-thirds of the way through this book I got really tired of the romance of the pastoral life. I grew up in a setting much like what he describes and it isn't all that lovely. People in Africa are tilling the soil in ways similar to Berry's characters and they don't seem quite as happy as the folks in this book.I have often wondered what era people were wanting to go to to find the ""good old days."" Now I know. I'm just fine here, thanks,"
5,Beautiful From Start to Finish,"This is one of those books that you want to make notes in margins so that you can go back and reflect on it's spirituality. In a simple elegant story, Berry captures the essence of the deep questions that are not always found in the dramatic events of life, but are in the everyday living. It touched me deeply and I am grateful for Mr. Berry for helping me remember the pleasure of a simple, reflective life."
3,I was expecting more,"... and perhaps that was why I was disappointed. I enjoyed the story, enjoyed the descriptions (though many were just way too long), and enjoyed the overall feel of the book. It was slow-moving, though. Sometimes I had to skip through long descriptions just because they were TOO descriptive. Good story, even though it was sad at times. I'm glad Berry was able to provoke some emotion in me!"
2,No,"This book reminded me of a pervert praying on a fifteen year old child. I don't like this book, not a good read."
5,Great Read! Couldn't put it down!,"I'm 45 years old, from Indiana, and a barber's daughter. I'm pretty sure I know some of the people that Jayber talks about. The stories weren't only about what the people were experiencing, but what they were thinking and feeling. My favorite quotes: ""I don't get paid to cut hair. I get paid to know when to stop."" ""He didn't yet know all that he was going to know."" AMEN to that!"
3,Bought the cut down the forest version,Read this book because Jim Palmer mentioned it in his book. It is the type of book that makes it easy to put yourself there
1,Expected a lot more!,"I expected this book to be great! Tons of great reviews, but I was disappointed. I suppose the writing is beautifully descriptive, and it's nice to learn about what it's like to live in another time in America, but the problem is (and a major one at that!) is that there is not plot to speak of. When I read a novel, I like there to be a story- I want it to go somewhere- and this book just sort of meanders along. As I read it, I just never really cared that much about Jayber or what he thought about the Bible or his town or the girl he loved or the people who lived in the town."
4,Slow starter but thought-provoking.,"This book was a book club selection or I might not have finished it. However, I am glad I did. I have never been a fan of stream-of-consciousness pieces, which this novel seems to be at the beginning, but once I got into the unassuming title character, I was hooked. Jayber's observations about religion, farming, nature, and relationships stayed with me long after I finished the book. Really is a good book club selection as there is much to discuss about author craft also."
5,Good low cost ring,Got this amethyst ring for my daughter as a replacement for one we gave her for Christmas several years ago and she literally wore out (band wore through). This ring has a nice solid band than should stand up to a good bit of use. My daughter liked the style and the stone color.
5,Nancy,Product worth every penny of the cost. It is very good looking on the person it was purhased for. She is very pleased with it.
2,THIS is Fett???,"I can be pretty forgiving where Star Wars is concerned. But the Boba Fett spotlight book ""Death, Lies & Treachery"" is just plain awful.The art by Cam Kennedy is ugly, with monochromatic washes on many pages that make it look like a child's paint-by-numbers book. You know the sort of thing I mean; little Timmy doesn't yet understand the correlation between numbers and colors, so he just paints the whole page green. Kennedy's work is like that.And the story by John Wagner isn't much better. It's a trilogy of sorts, all putting Fett at the beck and call of a Hutt even more loathsome than Jabba. His primary foe (or, rather, his primary foe and his primary foe's brother) is a caricature that one can't even begin to take seriously.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor"
2,Meh.,"Nothing to notable here. The plot was overall quite shaky, with an inconsistent mix of humor and action. Cam Kenndey's art is its usual.... uniqueness. Like it or not, it will take some getting used to.The stories are odd and at times rather ludicrous. Overall, if you want some nice Boba Fett/bounty hunter action, look for 'Enemy of the Empire' and the 'Shadows of the Empire' comic."
2,Kinda iffy......,"It was an okay comic book.....honestly, I was expecting more. The 'Star Wars' stories and spin offs are usually so good. I guess I was looking for a more complex plot and a relevant story line."
2,Don't be fooled by the recent picture!,"While the box has a reasonably recent picture of Kathy on the front, that's not what you get. These workouts must be from the early 80s -- disco music, the aerobics section is some sort of dance-thing, and the stretch session clearly came before she got in to yoga. The toning session, though, is worth the price of the tape. The aerobics session is worthless, and the stretching session is ok. After using her more recent tapes (new yoga, functionally fit), I was looking forward to this tape. While it may have been state of the art 15+ years ago, it doesn't do much today."
4,Great item... Horrible packaging!,"I love this product, but I don't love 12 of them! I understand that the Amazon grocery store is about bulk, but these aren't consumable. There's no reason to buy this many unless you are buying for multiple people."
2,Good movie with an improper ending,I enjoyed the movie all the way to the end. The ending was really inappropriate. The movie depicts boys who grow into men following the Catholic faith. There is no way a Catholic priest would ask to have his ashes scattered. It is against the Catholic faith. The body is to be maintained as a unit and buried. Whoever was responsible for this error should have done some research.
2,unintelligible dialog,"The movie bombed in the USA, grossing only $50,715 according to Box Office Mojo. It has a number of problems. The writing is not very good, it consists of haphazard episodes none of which lead much of anywhere, and the direction also could be better. The main problem in my view is that the speech is largely unintelligible to Americans. It could just as well be in Japanese or Chinese. The movie needs subtitles to understand what the actors are saying. Only about 30% is clear. That would explain why it never appeared in more than 13 theaters nationwide."
3,What it means to be an orphan,"Cute little movie setup in Australia about four boys growing up in orphanage in Australia's outback. They are known as ""December boys"" since all four of them celebrate their birthdays in the same month. Due to unexpected generosity of one of the orphanage patrons, these boys get to spend a little vacation in the little cove away from their environment. When one of the boys learns that there is a couple considering adopting one of the boys, the inevitable race and competition between the boys ensues. What happens in the process is what defines the true friendship between these four boys. The bond they make in the summer will remain for the rest of their lives in spite of the fact that they grow up and live all over the world.While the story is heartwarming, the references to Virgin Mary, etc. are a little too much. That is why I gave this film only three starts."
4,Wonderful warm adventure tale,Wow- what a movie. This will be a classic for years to come. Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame is wonderful and the resulting outcome is truly heart felt moment.Enjoy!
4,"Many are cold , but some are frozen","Skinny little orphan kids without much hope get a chance to summer by the sea in Australia.On the Pacific coast of Australia with amazing rock formations, a secret cave, a black horse and a beautiful girl,they find a haven of sorts.They discover feelings beyond what they thought they were."
4,A Movie to Stay,"It took a bit for me to get into the movie, but once there I wanted to stay. I liked that I didn't need to understand everything - Henry, the horse. I liked how the cove became another character. There were all the plot points you might expect but they come with little twists that elevate them above plain old clichés."
5,A Wonderful Coming-of-Age Story,"I don't want to say much, except that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's the kind of film that needs to be encouraged. Four Catholic orphanage boys are chosen to go on ""holiday"" at hidden ocean cove. The true purpose is for a middle-aged couple to chose one of them to adopt, but the boys are bonded like real brothers. The oldest boy has his first sexual experience with a local girl.It has a surprise ending, and the photography is beautiful. Watch it."
3,"Cute movie, but less than I expected.","Being a Daniel Radcliffe fan, I waited months for this movie to finally be available for purchase on DVD. While it is a cute film, I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it wasn't anything spectacular and I didn't enjoy the ending. It is worth watching, but unless you are a Dan Rad fan, I would say just rent the movie."
4,What Makes A Family,"December Boys is a movie about the bonds of friendship, and what genuinely makes a family.Maureen"
3,December Boys,He's come a long way from Harry Potter. It was a good movie but I was not so happy with the ending. Can't wait to see what Daniel Radcliffe has in store for his fans in future productions.
5,Awesome,"Amazing is definatly a perfect word, but also hilarious!!!! I have seen him on comedy central and I also have this dvd! He is just wonderful. I laugh so hard I think I'm gonna pass out! I love him! I can't wait til next year to see him in Vegas!! :)"
4,The Amazing DVD,"Amazing Johnathan has done it again. He has new material that is just as funny, and even more funny than some of his older. He makes you laugh and cry, well... laugh so hard that you cry. There isn't much else to say other than this is a great buy."
5,Amazing Johnathan is always Amazing,I thought the DVD was fantastic. Amazing Johnathan always makes my family laugh. He's a great comedian who brings so much laughter to our family. We adore him!!
3,I wish it was longer!,I LOVE the amazing Jonathan. This dvd could have been longer in length to showcase more of his amazing work. Still worth getting it though!!
2,wish I didn't buy this,I should have realized that the uncensored would have meant this wasn't a clean video. I saw some of this on T.V. a while back and thought he was real funny. But after seeing this I wish I wouldn't have bought it. I wouldn't recommend this one. I would like to find one that is censored though. I think I would like one like that.
2,Whats the point?,"From the first few mins into watching this I knew I was going to be disappointed. From early on you can tell its a rehash of his last Comedy Central special back in 2001! Wrong on Every Level is mostly the same old tricks and gags from his last special. Throw in the 2001 special, a couple of rejected Carrot Top props, a new (annoying) assistant and a few more times of flipping people off and you have Wrong on Every Level. Seeing this made me all that much happier that my friends didn't want to pay the $60 to see him live in Vegas a few years back..."
5,Johnathan's show gives me Alzheimers,"With most things that make you laugh, it's never as funny when you see it for the second or third time. It's not that way with The Amazing Johnathan. I laugh outloud at the same things I've seen over and over again. I've been lucky enough to be on stage with him (buy the golden circle seats when you go to Vegas) and even when I knew a joke was coming it was still hilarious. The point is, buy the DVD and you will get more than you money's worth. The way he handles the ring trick is worth the price all by itself."
4,What to Expect in Love and Relationships,"This movie is for anyone who second guesses the person they are with and want to be married to them. The main character, Gwynn Marcus, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, is engaged to her boyfriend Matt. Matt is the one for her and she knows it. But she second-guesses the relationship because she has family members whose expectations of marriage are based on fantasy. On top of that, her parents drive each other crazy and commit adultery behind the other's back. Matt, feeling that she isn't self-assured ends their relationship; and I can't blame him. Any man that possesses his qualities is a taker. Gwynn has an affair with her mother's lover wishing that he's the one but realizes that he's not the one for her and not to mention, he slept with her mother.This movie was a good movie. Four stars is enough to rate it. Frankly, these folks needed therapy and Miami's scenery isn't exactly that kind of therapy."
4,Accurate to a tee on life and love in Miami,"This is your typical Woody Allen style film, but spiced up and transported to Miami. The film is filled with predictable yet hysterical plot twists. The acting is great. I especially loved Kevin Pollack. All in all a great film!"
2,Dissapointing,"The title is so enticing, but the show is dull, and seems fake. If its gonna be fake at least make it good!"
4,More Is Better,"After purchasing Vitamin C's second album, I realised I like it alot more than her first release (though many of the tunes on it are great too). This is very pop & dance oriented, and features the single ""The Itch"", which was played quite a bit on my local radio station. Other contagious songs on here are a remake of ""I Know What Boys Like"", the tease romp of ""Sex Has Come Between Us"", the dreamy ""She Talks About Love"", the silly ""Dangerous Girl"", and new single ""As Long As You're Loving Me"". Do yourself a favor and if you liked C's last album go purchase this one soon."
3,Eh...,"Okay, the first CD was alright. This CD is better, but not great. 'As Long As You're Loving Me' and 'Graduation' are good, but the rest is sort of...so-so."
2,"""More"" is Less","When I first heard ""Smile"" from Vitamin C's first album, I thought she was great and I was really excited when another album came out. What a disappointing second outing! I first listened to this CD at work and almost fell asleep! Ony 2 songs stand out to me: her first single ""The Itch"" and ""Dangerous Girl"". Everything else, including the remake of ""I Know What Boys Like"", just sounds silly and bottom barrel. I hope her next album is better than this...it couldn't be any worse."
2,Ummm....,"What happened? Her first cd was great, but this one, well, it wasn't the worst I've ever heard, but deffinetly not the best! Although, I still have a little faith the her next cd (if she has one) will be like her first... great!~Chelsi~"
2,Another Enormous Disappointment From Ms. Fitzpatrick,"Well, I had high hopes for this. I thought I'd give it a try for fun, but was expecting little. (Which was too much) Compared to ""Vitamin C""'s debut, this is a major disappointment. While I was never a fan, Colleen has put out some decent work- ""Unhappy Anniversary"" was brilliant, ""Graduation"" undeniable and unmistakable, ""Me, Myself and I"" was even hit-quality. So, when I heard the provocative ""The Itch,"" I thought I'd talk myself into another Vitamin C album. What I got was an album with two good songs (She Talks About Love, The Itch) and several BAD ONES. I recommend avoiding this and all future Vitamin C recordings AT ALL COSTS!"
3,Not very worth it.,"It would already be a stretch to buy this album, with it only having 5 or 6 good tracks (read my review for the domestic release). So why pay lots extra for this? Sure, it has 3 bonus tracks, but 2 are the megahits from her debut. If you're buying this, chances are you were a fan of the debut. Sure, it has a new cover with a stunning photo of her - but for just a few bucks you can get the ""As Long As You're Loving Me"" import single with the same artwork + 2 or so remixes of it not on the album and possibly the music video. As for the other track, download it from a fan site or something."
5,More is what we want!,"I got Vitamin C's cd in hopes that all the songs would be as cool as The Itch. I was right!! The entire cd is much better than I thought it would be. The top songs are The Itch, Sex has come between us, Busted, Dangerous Girl, and Real life. Of course, I am completely in love with That was then, This is now, As long as you're loving me, where's the party, and she talks about love. i can't say no is also very good, and I know what boys like, although cute, does not fit on the album. The thing I like about Vitamin C is that not only does she have great beats (and wrote 2/3 of the album), but she also has very insightful lyrics, which is great to look into. if you liked Vitamin C before, you are going to be blown away by this!!"
3,Great CD !,"I really like her song ""As Long as Love Me"". It's very upbeat and unique. That's why I bought this CD."
1,NO MORE PLEASE!,"Has all that bleach gone to this girls brain?! What are these producers thinkin now a days?....People if you decide to buy this album cause you want to give her chance,make sure to keep that receipt close by!"
2,More is LESS,"To say I'm disappointed is an understatement, yet with each listen of ""More"" in my car, I realize how true it is. This CD is completely unnecessary, and utterly forgettable. The only tracks worthwhile are tracks 5 and 12 - the rest? Forget about it! Nothing is terribly catchy or memorable - 60 min. of filler!"
1,P-U-K-E,I just listened to some of this and it is pitiful. So artifically created and enhanced. The poor girl can't seem to figure out if she wants to be a pop star or a serious artist and in the end achieves neither.
3,"Though a Blake Edwards flick - it doesn't seem as good a flick as when I first saw it on the ""big screen""...","Bruce Willis, James Garner were a good pairing.Maybe now 20+ years later - my tastes have changed...Rent it - don't buy it."
5,One of my favorite movies.,"I doubt if anyone saw this movie when in came out. Bruce Willis and James Garner are great. I like period pieces and this one delivers. Garner has been a favorite actor of mine since the 60's. I have many of his motion pictures in my collection and I happy to include this one. It is not a deep, message filled movie. It is light entertainment with a touch of action and adventure. It is a typical ""good guys"" vs ""bad guys"" movie, with a touch mystery and intrigue to keep one interested. Enjoy."
4,Blake Edwards' Last Hurrah,"A critical and commercial flop, director Blake Edwards' ""Sunset"" (1988) deserves another look. Based on Rod Amateau's novel, this underrated Hollywood murder mystery gets tremendous star power from James Garner's reprise of Wyatt Earp and Bruce Willis' likable Tom Mix. Both actors have immediate rapport, with Edwards displaying nostalgic affection for the material. Malcolm McDowell is a particular standout as the Chaplinesque villain. Easily the best of Edwards' late-career films."
4,"And that's the truth, give or take a lie or two","""Sunset"" is one of the best 'odd couple' films I've ever seen. Bruce Willis (Tom Mix) and James Garner (Wyatt Earp) work together beautifully. And the story could be the truth 'give or take a lie or two.' Mix was one of Earp's pallbearers and wept openly at his funeral.""Sunset's"" a funny and heartrending take on Hollywood. You see deadly gunfights acted out with the old gunfighter watching from the wings. You also see cruelty, corruption and sadism in real life that couldn't have taken place in films of that vintage.My main reason for giving this film less than a 5 is because the video and audio were very poorly dubbed. I'm not entirely sure whether I got a bad press or the whole batch is like this, but it was apparent and distracting from the film itself.Still, ""Sunset"" is very worth watching and keeping for your viewing pleasure again."
3,Hmm...,"This was an inbetween movie for me. I niether dislike nor liked it. This is not your typical Bruce Willis movie and I can't quite call it a Western (its not ""Silverado,"" but it takes place in the ol' West). Think ""Maverick"" but with Bruce instead of Mel, sorta."
3,Worried about your Children? You will be soon.,"If you don't already worry enough about your children, you will after the first chapter of this book. For those parents who trust their instincts, try not to worry about everything, are not overly protective, but teach their children how to be safe in an unpredictable situation, this book just might scare you into worrying about things you never thought you had to worry about. Recognizing that this was not DeBecker's intent in writing, but you may only be able to read a few pages at time so as not to cause a nightmare."
4,Protecting the Gift/Gift of Fear Reprise,"Having read both of Mr. DeBecker's books, Protecting the Gift and The Gift of Fear, I noticed that much of the information in the former was taken from the latter. That is maybe to be expected, they do cover much of the same territory, but some of the examples given are exactly the same, except that in PTG instead of a woman alone you have a woman and a child. You also have a bit of the blaming the victim (or the victim's parent) mentality that you saw in The Gift of Fear. That being said, I thought PTG had a lot of common-sense, useful information in it. It gives specific examples of questions you should ask your potential day-care providers, your potential nanny, etc. Letters that you may find difficult to write are written for you, you can copy the text right out of the book. He has wonderful sources for follow-up information. The section on what to tell your child to do when he/she is lost is worth the price of the book."
5,Protecting the Gift,The information in this book saved my wife and child from a potentially bad day. It's a must read by anyone who is a parent or child care giver. I highly recommend it. It's a great follow-up to Gavin's first book.
4,Must Read ALL Parents,"I give this now to all expectant parents. This book is life-changing. As a mother, it posed questions that I have never thought of asking. I now have the guts to ask what is most important in keeping my son safe. deBecker gives parents 'permission' to be assertive parents.Without frightening us deBecker brings to our attention what we need to know to keep our children safe. He focuses on our instincts and his discussions make such obvious sense.I'm at the airport posting this review and looking forward to my long flight now that I have this book. Halfway through I simply cannot put it down.[...]I have started to give this book as a gift to every new parent I know.Excellent excellent book."
5,"more important than ""What to Expect..."" or Dr. Spock","This is an empowering book that reaffirms a mother's (or father's)ability and right to keep her child safe. Especially helpful were the sections that listed questions to ask prospective sitters and schools. This is my standard baby shower gift. It'll scare you, but it will also make your inner ""mother bear"" roar."
1,"""The Gift of Fear""...rehashed","I am a big fan of Gavin De Becker. I found ""The Gift of Fear"" helpful, intelligent and, often, frighteningly insightful. I have recommended it many times. That said, I am sad to report that I think it extremely misleading to present ""Protecting The Gift"" as a new book. Anecdotes aren't just warmed over, they're served up word for word. Whole chunks of chapters are identical to the first book, with only subjects changed to refer to parents and children rather than to adults. I rushed to buy this book and my advice is, if you have the first one, don't bother. As honorable as De Becker's mission seems to be, I'd say his editor and publisher are responsible for a pretty major consumer rip-off. Only the appendices seem new"
5,FANTASTIC,"Everyone should read this book. You'll be a lot smarter about life if you do. The perspective it gives on relative security, coincidence, chance, and risk are very enlightening. He wrote another book -- Protecting the Gift -- about protecting your kids. It's excellent, too."
5,"A Crucial Book for Parents, and All Caregivers of Children and Teens!","Protecting the Gift: Keeping Children and Teenagers Safe (and Parents Sane) is a crucial book for anyone that is caring for children to teach and help children learn about how to trust their own feelings when they encounter people, how to stay safe, what to do if you are ever separated from your child in a public place, and a lot of important things to learn to protect your children in today's world.Gavin De Becker's advice is essential, and there is never such a thing as being too prepared or knowing too much safety especially to protect children.I think anyone that even considers giving this book a one star review because they like guns needs to seriously reconsider that the wisdom in this book could very well save a child's life.Think of the children first. This book would make for great required reading for any parent or caregiver to help protect their children who are precious gifts."
5,Best Book for Parents,"Parents,Teachers,Doctors...everyone. This is the best book to teach how to keep our children safe. Wish Someone could have read the book and kept me safe as a child. I ant to also recommend two books, Nightmares Echo and Beauty For Ashes. Both of these books are told from the sexual abused child's point of view. Each offering thier own way to survive."
5,THIS IS A MUST READ !,"I've been teaching personal protection for 20 years.Gavin De Becker is a profit, and this book hits the nail on the head about children's safety and all the things that we don't do right with our children (relative to their safety.)"
4,Outstanding!!! I now have more useful tools for my security career.,"Great reading, everything in the book was well presented. I would recommend to anyone in law enfocement, executive security. I will definitely get my sons and dauhter-in-laws to read. And today I will strart reading Just 2 Seconds, really lokking forward to the read!!!"
5,should be required reading for all parents,"Fantastic book. A little hard to read at first, due to the nature of the subject, but stick with it and become a better parent.This book teaches us how to trust our instincts about other adults and situations. It helps us learn how to be confident in our choices for such things as babysitters, or homes we allow our children to visit.It teaches us how to make safe decisions for our kids and how to let go of feeling guilty or rude if we don't have a specific reason why we don't trust someone, we just don't feel comfortable about a person or situation. Better to be safe, (and skip the mild embarrassment) then overrule your instinct and risk harm to your child."
4,Lesbians and Gay Men in Health Care System,"This book offers practical and thoughtful advice for specific health care scenarios and problems that gay and lesbian patients encounter. It is meant for patients but can also benefit health care works who wish to better understand the specific problems of this patient population and who hope to serve them better. If you are gay / lesbian /bisexual and know that you will be interacting with the health care system for any extended period of time (e.g., you are sick or pregnant, etc) then it is worth it to at least peruse this book."
2,Fourth Grade Literature Group Book Review,"We are a group of fourth graders from Mrs. Larson's class at Sunset Hill School in Lawrence, Kansas. Most of us thought parts of this book were boring. We thought the ending did not close out the story well. We felt there was something else going on in the story that the author didn't tell us. The illustrations did not stand out and were difficult to understand. If you looked at the illustrations they would not make you want to read the book because they looked so sad. We also didn't like the story because the characters had too much anger. We also thought the story should have a happy ending. As it was it felt like the author had just stopped in the middle of the story. Some people might enjoy this book but we didn't."
4,The living history book,"The old lady of 100 years had a box of pennies...Her in-law treated her badly in front of her son,burning her few personal items.The American Indians kept buffalo robes with a symbol for each year asa memory pneumonic for the story of that year.History is not the same for individuals as for history books and newspapers.Most people in dealing with old people never think thatthey will be old one day and others will mistreat them as they havetheir own family? Children are willing to learn from old peopleand accept them as people.A blues book..."
2,EMOTIONAL TUG OF WAR,"This book is more a-day-in-the-life-of tale, rather than a complete story, but still interesting. A ""sleeper"" with illustrations which turned me off. A young black boy realizes how precious his great-great aunt Dewbet's old, one hundred penny box really is, while his momma considers it just a piece of junk. Michael is the pawn in an emotional battle bewteen the two women he loves most, neither of whom can understand or appreciate the other. How can a mere child discern whose prioritites have precedence? A poignant tale of familial devotion and loyalty. Despite the flat ending, elementary children can relate to this."
5,Excellent Read!,"As a child I have always loved this book. My 9year old struggles with his interest in reading, so one day while I was thinking of some books that may peak his interest I thought of this one. As always amazon carries just about any book you can think of so, I did the search, found the book and it was shipped to us within 2days. My son really enjoyed the book and I enjoyed reliving my childhood."
5,brittany Lowes hundred penny box review,"Hi, have you read a book called the ""Hundred Penny Box"" by Sharon Bell Mathis? Our class has, it is about Michael not letting his mom burn Aunt Dew's stuff . These are the three main charters Ruth, Michael and Aunt Dew. Aunt Dew is 100 years old she is nice and sweet she is not mean to know body. Michael is sweet to aunt Dew but he yells at his mom and talks back to her. Mama is not so sweet to Aunt Dew and she makes her do things she does not want to do. I like that Michael cared for Aunt Dew. He stands up for her. Author Sharon Bell Math's could of changed Michael's behavior. I will tell people to read this book because Michael is standing up for his aunt. Brittany Lowe, 3rd grade Scribe at Culture and Language Academy of Success (CLAS)"
5,This is the gratest book,I think The Hundred Penny Box is the gratest book Ive ever read. I think you should read this book because it is about a litt boy.Whell I should not tell you about it anymore so you could read it your self.
5,Absolutely amazing,"I had the opportunity to dance with Fat boy at one of his sessions. He is absolutely incredible. It has a touch of European essence which makes this cd much more exciting to dance to. The beat, the rhythm and the auro of this cd is one that will never lose its taste. Truly, a masterpiece."
2,"EA, please make the next game worth to buy.","To get started, I thought this would be the best game because the book is the best up til now. I didn't like it very much because:- You don't explore Hogwarts, you choose levels.- In the First Task you don't even completely control your Fire bolt. You only have to change direction of the broom and you don't actually fight with the dragon.- In the second task it's the same, you just change direction while swimming.- The duel with Voldi is horrible and it is very easy.- The only thing you do here is kill, kill,and jinx creatures ( that all look very alike).- There isn't a large variety of spells.- You can't zoom or toggle camera.- There are only 10 levels.Now, the only cool thing of the game:-Graphics and sound are excellent, but it is not worth wasting your money for this game. I hope The Order of The Phoenix is better and go back to the old game formula to explore Hogwarts."
3,where is the exploring?,"pros.more action than the other games.tasks are preaty good.better graphics than previous games.play Harry, Ron, and Hermine.charecters have statscons.a level game.No exploring.to get to the next level you have to collect triwizard shields.the charecters dont move in cut scenes.the beans move"
5,Excellent Follow Up to Azkaban!,"This game is quite impressive. I have been a follower of these games since around '03, and have seen them get progressively better. In my opinion, the games hit their peak at Azkaban, and leveled out at that point. Of course, the first two games were stunning in their own ways.Overall, this is a fun, challenging and innocent way to spend 20 bucks and a few hours. Well worth it!"
1,Thoroughly disapointing,"First of all, I am over 13, I simply forgot my password and didn't feel up to creating a new account. Okay, so, this game. My first impression, this is pretty fun, but i wish i could explore more. As soon as i got to the Hogwarts section of the game, i was thinking, maybe now i will get to explore. But no, i could not. I was extremley disappointed and upset with this game. I had loved the second and third game (i never tried the first), the third game especially. I thought the third game was amazing, and that the fourth could only turn out better. Well, i guess i was wrong. The greatest thing about the Harry Potter games was how there was so much more than just levels and battles. There was always something to do or explore. And now the manufacturers have turned Harry Potter from a geat fascinating game to just like every other game on the market nowadays. Hopefully, the fifth version will prove to be better."
2,Not as Good As Others....,"This game is pretty amazing, especially with all the new things, like combine cast and everything, and the whole storyline is good. The only bad thing is it isnt like the other 3 games, where you get to go aroudn and explore the school. You pick a level you want to play and u just do that level. So, i'm pretty disapointed with it."
3,i expected more.,i really love harry potter and i still have a gamecube so i really wanted to try this game. i watched some gameplay of this on youtube and thought it looked really fun. its just ok to me. like i forgot i even had this game and was only reminded of it when i was asked to review it. maybe it wouldve been more fun back in the day when i was younger but its just kind of boring.
4,"A workbook, rather than a book you just read and put away","This book is really a workbook, and not the normal kind of book you read and then perhaps put down and forget about, without implementing in your life.De Bono suggests that you do 1 exercise a day (1-2 pages), so it will take you a while to get through the book. It's not something you read in 1 or 2 sittings.I noticed that after doing the first 5 or so exercises I did change my way of thinking when talking to people - in my mind I would have 2-4 backup conversation topics, which arose out of what we were talking about - it was a strange effect to notice this in myself.However you should note that you need to keep doing his exercises and keep practicing and exercising your brain, as when I stopped after having done these 5 exercises the effect went away after a few weeks."
4,"The book was good, but the kindle edition lacks plates!","It's really disappointing to get a digital edition that isn't functionally equivalent in terms of content to the print edition.In this case, the print edition (from looking at the TOC of the digital edition anyway) has 16 plates - they're referred to in the text. But they're nowhere to be found in the Kindle edition. The figures are there though.So, if you're not content with a limited version of the thing, get the hard copy. And publisher, shame on you. I'd normally give 5 stars."
4,Rod works,"Launch rod works well, hard to find a substitute for estes system so this has to do. Reason had to buy it is that the rod itself is subject to bending and once it is bent,,,you get to buy a new one."
5,Literary Enthusiasms,"Another book of literary lists, interpolated with aphorisms on love, work, vacations and much else, culled from over fifty years of reading and collecting by this omnivorous Washingtom Post critic. What distinguishes this book from similar tomes is the wonderful taste, intelligence and wit Dirda brings to the enterprise. The pleasure he had in assembling his annotated lists is contagious: what to stock a guest-room library with, how to get children interested in reading, what music to take to a desert island, what are the best contemporary romantic novels, and so on. A book to browse, to debate and to take to heart."
5,Excellent,"I really enjoyed this book and was sorry to see it end. For me, books are like spiritual food, and this one was a tasty little meal. The section entitled ""Guidance Counselors"" in the chapter ""Matters of the Spirit"", and the last chapter (""Last Things"") were very helpful to me at a difficult spiritual/emotional time in my life. I did find a few mistakes (typos), but otherwise this was an excellent book. I'm looking forward to reading the author's other books."
1,Very Disappointed,The book is not what I was expecting. It is just a collection of quotes not a literary guide to reading. Very disappointed....
2,Disappointing,I bought this book based on the reviews and was totally disappointed by the writing as well as the content.
2,Great company So So product,I owned this smoker. It worked well for the first few times then the pellets would not feed properly. The problem is a build up of material in the pellet feed track. It will not clean off and prevents the feeding of the next pellet. The company sent me three new feeder units at no cost. Each worked the same way. Fine for the firsrt few times then the same problem. I also used the weights in the tube to help the feeding process. Did not work. I love the company but not the product.
4,Bradley Digital Smoker 4 Rack,"This electric smoker makes the job easy. I wanted to stick to our grill but my wife talked me into this. It's great. The smoke delivery system is great and precise. I decided against propane and charcoal for many reason that an electric smoker overcomes, e.g. electronic timer, automatic brisquet feed, digital temp control, etc. Reason this isn't 5 star: 1) packaging not sturdy enough. Box didn't look damaged but upon opening the first delivery, metal was rippled and door edge crimpted (bent) obviously due to being dropped. Amazon exchanged with no problem. 2) Construction/fit quality not perfect (FYI-made in China) 3) becasue it is electric, it has a great compact design but I need to set up a table outside to set it on to avoid bending over to view digital read out or to access internal shelves. I paid $449 3/07. Brisquests are available thru amazon at the best price when shipping is considered. They can also be purchased locally thru Bas Pro Shop."
4,Excellent value - excellent smoker.,"I've actually had this for nearly two years. My wife initially scoffed at my purchase, suggesting it would only be used a couple of times before it was forgotten. However, she's since come around and we use it frequently -- she actually uses it more than I do. We've probably put about 150 pounds of salmon and easily 600-800 pounds of brisket through it. In addition to ribs, turkey legs, sausage, potatoes and even eggplant.My one complaint is that the fuse holder broke about a month ago (20 months after I bought it). I repaired it with a $1.99 fuse holder from Radio Shack and about 15 minutes of labor -- by no means is this a deal-breaker, but at the price they could have sprung for a more durable component.All-in-all the ease of use of this la-z-que is unbeatable. I can put a brisket in before I go to bed, load the feeder tube with pucks, set the temp and know it'll be perfect when I wake up."
5,Upgrade from Bradley BTIS1 Original,"Had a Bradley BTIS1 Original for 4 years and learned to work with it to regulate smoke and temp. This new model does that for me digitally. Better temp moderation, much easier to regulate smoke, just more precise than what I was doing with the Original. Still has all the features I wanted, such as low temp to smoke cheese, wide choice of different wood bisquettes, plenty of room to smoke the quantities I want, and compact size. Previously I struggled to get to 225 or higher, but this unit gets to 250 with ease. Don't know if Bradley has improved the insulation in their units or not, but it's working for me. Get 3 of these: [...]"
5,"Easy to use, makes great food","So far I have used this product twice (I cooked a chicken and ribs). I thought that it held a decent consistent temperature plus or minus 20 degrees to start, but it stabilized quickly to plus or minus 10 degrees. I think that is pretty good compared to non-electric smokers that I have used in the past. This is something you can set and forget, check on it here and there. In comparison to a non-electric that you have to pretty much stand near the entire cooking process. I read the direction the first time and now it is easy to use. All you do is hit the setting you want to change, then use the up and down arrows to set. As with any cooking process the cleaning process is a bit involved. I would recommend this to any beginners or anyone that like low maintenance smoking."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","The smoker works by advancing small wood-chip pucks onto a heating element. But the advancing mechanism gets stuck because the tar or other sticky stuff build up seems to jam to mechanism so you get 20 minutes of smoke. If you want more smoke, you have to go and tend to the smoker and insert another wood puck manually, which defeats the purpose of buying an electric smoker. And the heating element is barely enough to smoke the wood. It has never gotten hot enough cook anything."
2,Cheaply made and tinny,This smoker came with a defective feeder that was feeding a smoke disk every 20 seconds or so. I called the manufacturer and they quickly replaced it with a new one. Good customer care in that department. But after several uses I found that in colder weather the unit will not maintain the temperatures needed to properly cook meat. Even dead in the middle of summer there is never a smoke ring and the flavor of the meat I have cooked in this unit does not measure up to a real smoker. I use it for ribs and pulled pork but that's about it. I do not recommend this smoker.
5,the best smoker for home use,"i have used the same smoker for 3 years, its wonderful and ive never had a problem... it sits outside summer and winter.... i use it summer and winter although i move it closer to the back door for winter use. i have used other smokers with wood chips and the pucks are far superior. the pucks create a better purer thicker smoke and they are fed in automatically so choose how many you want to smoke with and walk away... i use a wireless meat thermometer which transmits to me when smoking is complete... some meats i put in the grill next to the smoker for browning.... go bradley... you'll thank me later :o)"
2,An Expensive and Unreliable Way to go!,"Bradley Digital Smoker 4 RackWhen it works it does a good job. My first generator lasted 3 smokes before it died. They sent me a new one which was used twice. Tonight I went to my garage to preheat it and it was dead as could be.Even when it works the feeder mechanism can jam very easily. A large brisket or pork butt requires anywhere from 12 to 16 hours to cook. The Bradley timer only goes up to 9 hours. Go figure.I just ordered a Weber Smokey Mountain Charcoal Smoker which does an incredible job at a fraction of the price and without the problems, after all charcoal doesn't break. Bradley require expensive custom wood pucks - which cost about one dollar per hour of smoke. A brisket needs at least 6 hours of good smoke, so thats 6 dollars just for Bradley wood.I will try to sell it on Ebay if Bradley sends a new smoke generator- if not I will junk it, lick my wounds and wish a bought a Weber to begin with."
3,"Excellent smoker, but quality could be better","I purchased this Bradley smoker as a replacement of Brinkmann's Smoke'n'grill electric smoker about 5 months ago and was very pleased by its work. The smoker does its job really well, it doesn't need much of your attention, and the quality of smoked meet is just wonderful. I've used the device ~5-6 times and had no problem with it until today. The washer that holds 2 metal pieces in the bisquette supply assembly (the unit that connects the electric motor with the bisquettes pusher) broke apart. The smoke generator was not able to move the bisquettes anymore. I had no time to send the smoke generator back to Bradley, so fixed it myself. It would be great if Bradley took more care of the product quality (the generator is made in China). Overall the smoker is the best choice for a ""home"" consumer available on the market today, I'm giving it 3 stars to attract the manufacturer's attention to the product quality."
1,Turkey Day Disaster!!,Got together just in time for Thanksgiving. Having about 40 folks over. Big families. Lit it up and it worked for less than an hour before the heating element went poof! Buy American. This is cheaply made junk! The heating element is a joke. Many of the screws don't match up including the plug attachments for the plugins. Up late having to scramble to get meats cooked. Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this product. Happy for the folks that have one that works. Destroyed my Turkey Day prep. Happy Thanksgiving all.
5,What a convenient way to smoke food!,"This is my second venture into smoking food. I have enjoyed smoked meats for years but, aside from a ""manual"" charcoal smoker that we had years ago that I could never get working right, it is the first time I have been able to smoke my own meats. We have already had smoked pork ribs and roast, brisket, and chicken. The Digital Bradley Smoker makes it so convenient and easy.Being able to use the smoke and heat separately allows us to cook other things besides smoked meats outside during the hot summertime in Texas and keep the heat out of the kitchen. The food cooked in the Bradley has been absolutely delicious and I recommend this smoker to anyone thinking of buying a smoker.I also purchased a Maverick RediChek Two Probe Remote Thermometer that allows me to read the smoker and meat temperatures from inside the house, and that was a great addition to this purchase."
2,Bradley Digital Smoker,"I'm very disappointed with the digital aspect of this smoker. Oven set temp and oven readout were usually 40 degrees off. I purchased a separate thermometer to compare what it would read compared to the oven readout on the smoker and it read 30 degrees hotter than the oven read out. Don't waste your money on the digital version.Support from Bradley basically told me I would have to learn how this smoker works. Too bad they don't say that up front, I could have saved $100 and bought the basic model."
4,Interesting yet slightly flawed overview of Kubrick's films,"I would really love to give this book three and a half stars, but unfortunately that's not an option here. This book gives a detailed account of Kubrick's films, including history of the shooting, cast and crew comments, and excellent photos. The only problem I have with the book is the author's completely biased view of Kubrick. I understand that having a fan write the book makes perfect sense, but any quote that is of a vaguely negative nature toward Kubrick is treated with total horror and disdain. Kubrick was a genius -- there's no doubt about that -- but he was not perfect, and Howard refuses to acknowledge this.That particular issue aside, this book is essential for anyone who's a fan of the late, great Stanley Kubrick."
2,I got what I paid for,"It was probably made for a much larger dog because it would not stay on our dog.(although stated to fit a dog her size.Cheaply made,but,like I said....you usually get what you pay for."
3,Beware of the Light Brown,"Heavy duty, yes. Light brown? Emphatically, no. They're blazing gold. I'm an ashy-light-brown, and these look absurd on me. I'll find someone to give them to, if I can find a brassy blonde."
5,The best children's video out there!,I wish they would make this in DVD form. I got this for my kids when they were little 20 years ago and all the catchy tunes and puppets gave us all happy memories! I went out to buy it in DVD for my first grandson but alas they only have the DVDs so i bought another copy for him and he of course loves it! I highly recommend it to every young family for hours of wholesome entertainment :)
2,does not accurately read the temperature.,"In the winter time I started noticing a large discrepancy between the temperature stated on the radio and this thermometer. I brought it inside and put it in the refrigerator with a known accurate thermometer. At 40 degrees farenheit it was off by 3 degrees. I then put it in the freezer and at 0 degrees farenheit, it was 6 degrees off.At room temperature the temp is within 1 degree (acceptable).I have not checked the error with temperatures over room temperature."
2,Thermometer ordered,I have had this for over a week and changed mounted locations a few times in my yard and still it does not record properly.
2,Disappointed..,"Many other reviews said that these thermometers were consistent but that was not my experience. Sitting side by side, the temperature readings varied by an average of 8 degrees in various places. Two of them were usually about 2 degrees apart, but the other was normally about 6 degrees from the others. Very disappointed and will be returning."
1,Cheap and inaccurate,"This item was poorly made and did not work. I understand that you get what you pay for, and the cheaply made aspect wouldn't be so bad... if it had worked at all. No matter what, it seemed to think it was in the 60's in my house. Which isn't accurate, *in the middle of summer* when my thermostat says it is between 70-80 in here.I bought three of these - two for different areas inside the house, and one for outside. I returned them all, and was only credited for two. I'm not sure why they did not see fit to give me a full credit."
3,Average thermometer,"I bought this product to put on my wall in my office so that I could monitor the temperature. The first one that I ordered arrived smashed and I had to return it. Amazon, with its usual amazing return policy had a new one to my door in 2 days.I am not really sure how accurate it is though. I have it on my wall next to my desk. If my office is so hot I am sweating it says 78 degrees. If my office is so cold I am shivering, it says 78 degrees. So, it doesn't appear to pick up subtle changes in temperatures. Either that or its all in my head. Which is a possibility."
1,Timex thermometer,This thermometer is useless as it registers about 10 degrees above the real temperature. Kind of defeats the purpose of having it.
3,too low,i use this out side the window in my office but unfortunately it tops out at a measly 120f which it just isn't enough what with global warming and all mean its routinely over 110 almost everyday.my office in in kuwait.
4,It works perfectly,"This thermometer works perfectly and it's cheap. I'm giving 4 starts because it's a little big and you need to put it in a wall, it would be better if it had an stand."
2,Not for long distance viewing,"I installed the bracket on a porch post so I could see it through a window. Viewing distance was about ten feet and that is a bit too far to easily read the temperature. To best see the red line you also have to view from a fairly small range of angles. Viewing straight on the red line kinda disappears, at least from a distance. Anyway, after getting the bracket installed I noticed the red line was all broken up at the top. I then saw that the glass tube was cracked, I tossed it and got a digital."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"It was inexpensive. It came promptly. The bracket is a nice feature and went up easily. I suppose I have no complaints except that the thermometer is very inaccurate. I live where it is very cold in the winter. Stretches of 20 and 30 below for weeks. The thermometer was consistently about 11 to 12 degrees off. For instance, 8 below zero would register as 4 above. Oh well, it was made in China. If you want an accurate thermometer, you are going to have to do some research and then pay for quality."
2,Not accurate,"Not sure how a simple thermometer can be so off, but this one definitely is. Reads 10-25 degrees higher than actual temp outdoors (and no, it's not in the sun), and when I brought it inside, it read around 10 degrees cooler?! Wish I could return it but for $5, it's not worth it. Bottom line: buy a different thermometer. You can guess better than this one!"
5,Simple thermometer,I bought these for a marketing campaign at our apartment communities. We ran a contest that was based on the temperature outside. They worked like a charm!
1,Did Not Work and Stained Clothing,"The Squirrel and Raccoon version of this Get Away product proved totally worthless. I followed the product directions to the letter. It actually attracted more squirrels and chipmunks to the feeder, did not deter raccoons from ""raiding"" the feeder, and less birds were attracted to the feeder and the surrounding mulched area. Besides that, I ruined a pair of pants since the liquid irreparably stained them when a gust of wind blew a few drops back at me. I took a chance on purchasing this product because of its promised effect even though I found no reviews of it here or elsewhere. Now others will have at least a bit of guidance."
5,Crazy,"This album is a great documentation of life changes, life transitions. It's kind of like here, this is where I am and this is what I'm doing. A review can't really capture that. I recommend it highly though."
4,triviahead,"Now I know why my Mom wouldn't allow my brother to buy this album way back in '69...it was TOO COOL and hip and WAY ahead of it's time. Even today, this album sounds relevant. Long live Iggy Pop!!"
5,Finally a Decent CD,"Finally someone reissued this on a decent sounding, well packaged CD. This beats the pants off of the previous CD version. The bonus tracks are fascinating. What on Earth was John Cale thinking when he mixed I Wanna Be Your Dog with the guitar sounding like a bumble bee, the drums way off in another room somewhere and a giant set of sleighbells dominating everything? The record would never have ignited the punk revolution if it had been issued with his mixes. The liner notes and photos are informative. Look at those amplifiers! And that Mosrite bass."
4,top notch,"Consider yourself an Iggy/Stooges fan? If so, then you MUST own a copy of this. The 1st disc is a great remaster of that fine, fine album with loads of clarity and punch.The 2nd disc is a selection of previously unreleased outtakes and alternate versions. Worth the price of admission alone is the almost 7 minute version of `No Fun'. And what a great version it is, too."
2,eh...,"The remastered version sounds better than the first time around. Still, Cale had no idea what he had here. And there are still only 2 good songs here. The rest is boring. Seeing them live in 1969 wouldn't have been, I'm sure. Fun House and Raw Power are probably the two greatest rock records ever. Just listen to those and construct imaginary versions of I Wanna Be Your Dog and No Fun as recorded on one of those instead of buying this."
2,Pretty Awful Album,"Let me say first that Fun House by The Stooges is on my Top 10 CD list. And Raw Power is right up there. Plus I love Iggy Pop. And I listen to lots and lots of different music. Bought this mainly for consistency's sake. Bit of advice if you haven't heard Funhouse, get this first and work your way to Funhouse. If you get way into Funhouse first, this album will be a real big let down. Actually, do yourself a favor, download I Wanna Be your Dog, Real Cool Time, and Little Doll from iTunes or something. The rest of the tunes on this album are pretty bad and irrelevant. Then go buy the Rhino remastered Funhouse and Iggy's remix of Raw Power. The difference between this album and Funhouse sounds like two different bands. They can hardly play their instruments on this album and Iggy sounds pretty tame. Some of the solos are just god awful. Sorry, but Funhouse just rules The Stooges roost."
3,not leather!,"These sandals are comfortable enough, but don't be fooled by Amazon's lack of description- this isn't leather but vinyl. They look pretty good regardless, but i wouldn't have bought them if i'd have known that they were plastic."
3,could've been better,"Matlock is definitely one of the very best TV Shows of all time. But, the only reason why I'm giving the Season 5 dvd release only three stars is because almost 10 minutes of The Secret: Part 2 is missing from this dvd release. I have absolutely no idea how this happened. That's the only episode on this dvd release that isn't complete."
4,Good trimmer but VERY VERY NOISY,This trimmer has lasted the longest of any of the trimmers I have owned at 2 years and still holds a good charge but is very noisy and wakes up everybody in my house when I trim before going to work. other then that it is a good trimmer.
5,Linda Norelco Review,"This Norelco works great, cuts close and my husband loves it. It is lightweight but works awesome and is great on storage and being able to recharge quickly and very easily. WE LOVE IT."
2,Move on - Breaks easily - Can't run on AC power,"Used this for a while. After about 3 months the plastic length adjuster broke. Now it's worthless.Also, if it starts to slow down and you plug it in, it'll take 1/2 hour to charge as it won't just use the outlet power.With so many choices, just move on"
4,Value for Money,Pros;Easy to use and works perfectlyValue for moneyCons:Suited only for US plug points.Doesnot work internationally..
4,Item is great storage /plug is odd to use,"I gave this item to my husband for Christmas and he loves it. The only thing he doesn't like is the storage cup and the way you feed the electric plug adapter into the storage cup. Many times when you thing the bottom of the groomer is plugged in to be recharged it isn't. A minor frustration to get use to. He loves doing his sideburns,ear and nose hair trimming in between barber visits."
2,short battery life,It may be that I got one with a bad battery but a charge doesnt last even 5 minutes.
4,Works for me,I bought the G370 for the nose hair trimmer. I hoped it was better than the Panasonic ER411NC which was torture to use. The Norelco has worked great so far. Followed the directions to charge the unit for 10 hours and I have had no problems and no discomfort. Its not pretty but it does the job very well.
3,"No, no for use internationally.","Great trimmer, but a big no, no if you are going to use this while traveling abroad as the power adapter in only 110V one (US only). It should include the universal adapter 110 - 240V. Would have gives 5 stars then.Like the fact that the it has self sharpening blades and no need to oil them.Without thinking I plugged it in while abroad and the trimmer got hot and battery burned out."
2,Another Failed Norelco Product,"I was very disappointed in this set. It looked as if it had a great selection of grooming tools, but they were all quite ineffective -- especially the ear piece which just buzzed and about makes you deaf, but doesn't shave any ear hair. Good luck getting this set to do anything with ear or other stray hairs. The best part of the unit is the main unit, a small trimmer that works OK for trimming down beards and mustaches. That's OK, but not worth the price of admission for the entire set. Overall, this brand has gone downhill from a top brand to Chinese junk in the last decade."
1,got pain to use first time,"Please careful about this Grooming Kit. I bought one week before and when I turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work. This product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not. This lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair. Also this can not be used for continuous use, if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge."
1,Flimsy meets inexpensive,I bought this for my brother after he misplaced his old conair. From opening the box it became clear why it was sold for the price it was and upon using it for the first time it broke. The plastic is very flimsy and of course once broken cannot be repaired. I've since dumped it and ordered another conair. I don't recommend this at all.. except of course if you're looking for something cheap.
1,Battery no longer holds charge - only a few weeks old,"I was happy with this product for the first few weeks - it was cheap and small and light and did an adequate job. However, when I left it unplugged for about a week or so, it completely lost its charge and won't recharge. Note that the instructions explicitly say to NOT leave it plugged in all the time, so that's why it was unplugged. I'm not having much luck getting a refund fom Norelco, so it seems like I'm out of luck. Feeling lucky?"
2,Not for body hair trimming.,I was expecting an excellent product from Norelco when I purchased this to replace my worn out Conair trimmer. It turns out that the quality is just fair. It works Ok for trimming facial hair though not perfectly. I strongly suggest NOT using this for trimming body hair because it is very easy to clip your skin. No matter how careful I am I can't avoid drawing blood. I will defiantly be replacing this set with something better very soon.
3,a bit of dissapointed,"I had for five years nolerco clipper 20xl (similar price 5 years ago). Someone in store told me that g series replaced xl series.I am not sure if this is true, but G370 dissapoints me. Plastic looks cheap, joints are not solid, power cord is short, but even if it would be longer it wouldn't help. Attaching the cord wil not run this trimmer/clipper, battery has to be charged before doing anything (in 20xl in situation when battery is gone I could always attach the power cord and continue). I am happy with tis clipper right now, but I don't expact to have it too long. It looks too cheap for that."
3,Does the trick.,Purchased approx 6 months ago. I use to shave beard and head. The unit works well and isn't loud.My only (major) gripe is the adjustable head is very difficult to adjust without taking the whole head piece off.Other than that a great value.
1,Accessory products are cheap and break easily,"I bought this set, and the accessory pieces broke within weeks. I returned the broken set, and got a new set in exchange, and the second set did exactly the same.Buy something with better quality, and avoid dealing with the hassles of this inferior set."
3,"Great shipper, quick service","The service was great, but I returned this grooming system unopened because I decided to purchase a more expensive clipper with a set of separate combs."
1,"Cheap set, won't last, cheap pieces, not recommended","This set is a joke, looks like a toy set. No recommended. Buy something better $10 or $20 bucks more."
5,Love the Shaver,this is just what i wanted to strart my twin boys on. shipped fast and looks good. They will be so happy to have there own
4,Good For the price,It is nice trimmer and it can be washed with anti bacterial after the use. Definitely worth for the price.
5,Excellent product!,"It is a simple product! Nothing especial, but works really well.It was really what I wanted. I recommend it."
4,Excellent product.,This is the third beard trimmer I've owned and the best one yet. I would recomend this product to anyone looking for a good beard trimmer and one that can also cut hear.
3,Decent - But Not As Good as Previous Models,"This is the third Norelco ""Groomer"" I have owned over the past dozen or so years. Following the trend of most small appliances these days, they have continued to get cheaper in price, but also lower in quality. This model does a decent job (I use it as a beard trimmer) but it's smaller, noisier, and doesn't do as good a job as its immediate predecessor (about $35 on Amazon 4 or 5 years ago), or the best; my first Norelco model about a dozen years ago ($70 at Target). So I'd say it's a good deal considering the low price.Frankly, I'd rather have paid the $70 for the old, superior model, which worked faster and quieter."
2,It's OK...but,Liked much more the older model. My wife doesn't like and she still keeps using the old one...the new model feels more 'plasticky'. Why changing something that works!
2,"Great for 2 months, then the charger died","The groomer itself works well, holds a charge for quite awhile and is quite compact. Unfortunately, the charger stopped working after two charges. Since I didn't use it that much I got about 2 months out of it. Not a great investment."
5,love it,"I chose this rate because i'm very proud of if.I don't really have time to go the barber, i do it myself.I would like to recommend it to all my friends."
4,good,"i've had it for several months now and its going strong. i use it for daily saving and its good enough for me. i get good usage off of one charge. given the price and its other cutting functions, i'm satisfied with this purchase."
4,Good one,Worth for buying it. I really liked using it. Cheaper than the price in walmart / sams club. I would recommend it.
3,Value for money but expected more !,"this product is certainly value for money. But to my dissatisfaction, the blades are not that sharp. I expected more afterall it being a Philips product!"
3,Cheap plastic,"Bought this several months ago at Walmart I believe and yes, the trimmer works well, but the plastic beard attachments fall apart rather easily. The buttons used to set the hair length broke within a couple of uses rendering them useless. Surprised to see it rated so highly here. I liked the actual trimmer and the trimming attachments, but it is useless as a beard trimmer unless you want it all gone."
1,Cannot cut my hair,Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System is definitely not a hair trimmer. All hair get stuck inside the trimmer and it stops cutting. Maybe it is good for something else but not for hair trimming.
1,The battery sucks but.....,"after a few recharges the battery died but it was my fault as i left it recharging too long but...if you open it up with a small kitchen knife (take the head peace off and prise open the 2 sides)then take the old rechargeable battery out - ""peel off"" positive and negative connections gently with small pliers and then reconnect a normal AA battery ( white cable (+) black one (-) from your remote control for your examplenow it works perfectly and it only takes 5 minsof course every time it dies you will need to use a new battery but if you only use it a once a month like me thats cool as its better than throwing the whole thing away and now i dont need different adapters when i travel to other countries .please dont throw the rechargeable battery in the binrecycle it please"
1,Try another brand,I bought two philip grooming sets and after using one it failed. Was going through amazon return policy on this but find it more of a hassle to return to get a replacement. So I will have to cut my losses. Please stay away from this...its trash.
4,hair trimmer and groomer,"Works real well. This is the second one I have ordered, as I broke a part on the first one (stepped on it)and the replacement part was the same price for a brand new entire set up."
4,Return of investment,"Its been 2 years after i got this.Whats the one most amazing thing about this product? The customer service.After using this for 6 months teh clipper attachment broke when it fell down. I called customer service.What do they do? They sent me a brand new set. Not this model, but an upgraded model. No questions asked. WTF :-)I have seen nothing like this customer service ever any where. Norelco rocks"
3,Mediocre,"The clipper and attachments are a little too narrow, so it takes a long time to do an entire head. There is also some wiggle on the gaurd, so the hair is not always cut exactly the same length. However, the rest of the attachments work fairly well. Overall, you get a decent clipper for a very low price."
1,"Terrible, do not buy",So crude and painful that I could not use this trimmer. The quality is horrible. It cuts skin easily and pulls stubble. I tried using twice and it is simply impossible.
1,Norelco G370,"At first this electric hair trimmer seemed like a good thing. It's from Norelco, so I thought it was made by a reputable company. It's Compact size and included accesories for around $24 seemed agreeable to me. But the accessories are made of thin plastic parts. So you have to exercise care when switching them out and when cleaning the whole system. Also, after only using it four times and charging it three times, the rechargeable batteries will not take a charge anymore. Now this almost new trimmer is nothing but a useless paperweight. From now on I'll stick with a corded trimmer. They're not as convenient, but at least they'll be more reliable. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this piece of junk."
5,Excellent value,Works very well in trimming long hairs that my electric shaver misses. Works well in trimming nasal hair. I highly recommend the Norelco G370.
4,Easy to use,Light and easy to use. Great for the price I paid. Would have like stringer blades though for tough beards
3,It is good product !,"The quality is good and it works perfectly fine. however, the packaging can be improved specially after unpack the plastic packing as it has loosen parts !"
1,The Worst Trimmer Ever,"I had a Philips Norelco 20XL which served great for 10 years until the guard comb eventually broke. Bought this one and hoped it would as good. No way! This thing seems to be engineered by people who never used it themselves.1. The power switch and head release buttons are next to each other, so I kept pushing a wrong button.2. The comb guard is so flimsy that you are never sure if it is in right position or how long it will stay there. No surprise the tiny spring broke in a couple of uses.3. The hair length scale is on the wrong side!4. The power cord is so short that you cannot only use the trimmer cordless.5. IMHO, all-in-one thing is wrong if you cannot use the product for it primary function.Awful product, terrible engineering. Shame on Philips. I do not care of its low price. I would happily pay twice the price to get a decent one."
5,Awesomeness!,"This product is all I could have asked for and more. I think that it is the detachable parts that make this product amazing. And, while I haven't had it for a long time I am impressed to the point that I can say, do yourself a favor and make the purchase."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Item arrived quickly, but soon discovered wouldn't even charge. Thought I was doing something wrong, so resorted to included instructions. Never was able to get the item to work and returned to Amazon. Very low quality. I'd look elsewhere."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"This trimmer works great. I don't understand some of the complaints. Why would anyone complain because it only works in the cordless mode? Do they want to be anchored to the wall with an electric cord? The quality is excellent. I keep the attachments in a separate storage container so I can easily switch from trimming my nose hairs to cutting the hair away from my ears. (For some reason, my hair stylist never seems to get that right.) Since I wear glasses, it is a relief to have the hair cut away over my ears. Using the 'shaving' attachment, I can quickly clean up the ears and the side burns. In fact, I haven't been back for a haircut since I got this product. It turns out that the only reason that I went to my stylist was to get the hair cut away from my ears and to look at Amy's ample breast."
3,You get what you pay for.,"After reading both good and bad reviews for this product, I purchased it to trim my husbands beard (after his old trimmer died). It does a decent job of trimming. The nose hair attachment doesn't work. The micro foil attachment rips hairs out rather than cutting them. The attachments are made of cheap plastic so handle with care."
4,Gets the job done!,"This product gets rid of ll my unwanted hairs easily and safely. The instruction booklet is a bit lengthy but it's well worth the read so you properly use it. At first I was nervous to try it but as long as you're careful, no harm will come to you. I'm glad I have this product and I use it all the time."
2,Norelco beard and mustache trimming set,I had a problem with the beard trimmer guards losing teeth after only a few uses. I think this product is very flimsy.
4,Best Grooming kit for the buck,"When it comes to electric shavers, I always go Philips but this grooming system was actually better than expected for the price I paid. This product is good mainly for trimming and fixing your sideburns or hair it's great if you like to keep a little scruff when shaving you know Ben affleck style, also the nose trimmer worked well for me but not the best thing if you're looking for a close shave. Overall its a decent product."
3,Don't buy,"Thing is loud as a F-22 fighter flying over your house. It will last you a long time, but than again you better wear ear plugs when using it."
2,do not buy,"my biggest problem is there are two gapping clips and they are about the same size, 3-4 inches. way too thick of a gap for any facial hair. what's the point? because it's obviously not a hair trimmer..."
5,Awesome shaver!,"I just bought this at Walgreens to replace my electric Remington shaver that died after a few years. This one is larger, so shaving takes half the time, and with more attachments I can even cut my dog's hair now! It's not loud enough to scare the dogs. The old shaver would sometimes catch my skin - not break it, but it would hurt (ex. armpits) - this one doesn't do that! I LOVE this shaver."
2,Not a body trimmer,"While this trimmer is really good and compact for shaving your head hair and beard it's not very good as a body trimmer. I tried trimming in my body and it gave me big painful bleeding cuts. It does not have an adjustable head so that I can move the balde a bit back. I tried the other smaller attachment and got the same results. I had a wahl before and never had the issues. Will go back to Wahl, which never caused me bleeding while trimming body hair and which also comes with adjustable head..It's a great trimmer as long as you don't use it for your body hair."
3,No clear shave on chest and nose.,It takes more effort to shave the chest. Also the nose piece does not work to perfection. The face shave piece useless. Its best to use this product for hair shave.
1,Worst Groomer I've Ever Owned,"I have owned many different types and brands of trimmers, shavers, groomers, etc. and this is BY FAR the worst one and it is not even close. Luckily it was a gift, so I didn't waste my own money on this worthless product, but upon using it, I immediately knew how cheap it must have been. The shaving attachment wouldn't cut butter during the summer in the Sahara. The trimmer grabbed and pulled my hair, and repeatedly cut and stabbed my skin, so much so that it looks like I have minor burns on my face and neck. The UBER CHEAP trimmer attachments that are supposed to allow for precision, known as guide combs, were the worst and most useless part of this waste of raw materials. After using this piece of garbage one time, I immediately pulled my old trimmer out, another brand, 2 years old, and realized just how terrible this one was. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!"
1,Buy band-aids too,"This product is horrible. Buyer beware. I had bought this mainly to help trim my husband's neck hair and ended up nicking him several times. And yes, I used it correctly. It's just not safe. Hopefully, Norelco sticks to their satisfaction guarantee."
2,Photo Not Accurate,This is the second set of the G370 I bought. The first set was like the picture shows with holder included. You could keep all the tools on the counter top. What you actually get NOW is just the tools and NO holder. This means all the attachments are either scattered on your counter top or you've got to put them under the sink. Amazon needs to update their photos.
4,Not bad for the money,"The trimmer isnt bad. It was very cheap and you get what you pay for. The attachments are a little flimsy and cheap but they work just fine. The trimmer itself cuts pretty well, it has yet to tug my hair and it cuts evenly. Its light and easy to maneuver. Its gets the job done as advertised. I haven't used it that much but the battery life seems to be pretty good, only charged it once and it has lasted a few uses. If your looking for a trimmer to just get the job done then this one is fine for you."
4,"Same groomer, different color","I've had a older Norelco beard trimmer for years, and was very pleased with it. I was afraid that because of its age, it might fail on me at a bad time, so when I saw this one which looked very similar, I bought it. Turns out it is identical except for color (the old one is light gray) and the parts will interchange. So now I have a brand new one just like the one I've used and liked for years, plus a bunch of interchangeable spare parts and an spare charger.My only complaint with the new one is the color. After one use, I see why they made their earlier model light gray. The new black one attracts beard trimmings and looks awful after just a short use, especially if your beard is gray. Never even noticed it on the gray one. The new black one is much better looking than the old one, but only for a few moments until you use it."
5,Great value,"I bought these trimmers for my husband. When I seen the great price for such a good name brand I expected them to be ""ok"" and just get him by till I found a better pair, but was pleasantly surprised! They are very good quality, good weight and a nice sharpness. My husband has extremely cores hair and these buzz right through without hesitation. He really liked the assortment of attachments it came with. So many of these smaller grooming kits come with attachments that really aren't very useful but these are all handy to have. It seems to hold the charge pretty well and the casing isn't ""cheap"" feeling at all.Good product, would defiantly recommend to others looking for a good deal."
4,Excellent quality and battery life,"Works great.Looking at price, best deal around.Can be used for all purposes, nose and ear hair trimming,beard trimming, hair clipper etc.I recommend it."
2,love it so far! recommend it,the product shipped in time! i got it even sooner! and it works like a charm!! lots of options and completely worth the bucks! would definitely recommend it!!(UPDATE) - the product stopped working shortly after use and it doesnt charge anymore
3,"Reasonable trimmer, flimsy build for hair attachment","This is relevant for G370/G380: I purchased the trimmer as I liked the convenience of a cord free appliance. I travel a lot, so it's great to be able to pack and take with me.It's very convenient, works really well - I use for trimming hair only.Major downside is the flimsy adjustable hair trimmer. The adjustments are not very secure when fitted to the trimmer, however, the flimsy plastic teeth on the comb easily break. I've contacted Philips/Norelco and it's not possible to buy replacement hair trimmer attachments, they can't even ship you one for free. As the item is sold with a Two Year Warranty in the US they will replace the full product for you. Seems like such a waste of money in return shipping, packagaing etc.Come on Philips, just come out with a sturdier hair trimmer attachment that you provide an appropriate hard case for that can easily be used whilst travelling."
4,"Any place, any time","The set of trimmers and cutter is just right for the man who takes his shaving and trimming on weeklyor more often bases. The plastic is cheap by some standards but for the price, most buyers might want two or an accessory package. Great for trimming kids, adults and older gentlemen like me."
2,YANKS THE HAIR OUT,"Gosh, what a disappointment! I am a woman and I use this grooming kit for more personal place and the danged thing actually cut me in 4 places that are very sensitive! AND, the nose trimmer mostly rips the little hairs out rather than cuts them. I still have it as I haven't replaced the kit but I will not use it unless a total emergency arises. I was very disappointed but for goodness sakes, cant they at least make it sharp enough not to pull the hair out and then not so poorly done that it cuts your skin?"
2,OK but no stand,"The unit came with a cloth bag, but no charging stand. It makes it harder to store and charge. Would have bought another if I knew, but it does its job. But still, it is not superior, so without the stand this a pass item. Get another."
4,"Great product, but stand not included","This product works great, but don't let the picture fool you. It does not come with the stand to hold all the pieces neatly together."
5,Norelco worked fine but not everything comes with it...,"I recently retired a Remington grooming set that I had for 4+ years...Tried my chances on this one and I did good. I used it last night cutting my hair with the #9 attachment, used the small foil shaver and the trimmer which all worked better than expected.Not Norleco's fault but the storage case did not come with it but Amazon is taking care of that right now. For the price, a perfect buy by far!12-14-2011Update. After 3 attempts to get the bottom base for the Norelco, as shown in the picture, Amazon was unsuccessful. 3 TIMES. The shaver still works good for the money spent, I just wish I could get whats showing in the picture. I gave up."
2,"alright, but runs out of charge quickly","I can't get it to hold a charge, and it doesn't work even when it's plugged in. It has probably gone through 3-4 recharge cycles. That isn't that many. Now I have to buy a new one. What a waste of money."
5,Good,Recommended...I have ordered another one for a frd...good battery...has many options...definetly better than using razors... wish i had this before..thank you.
4,good product,I have a goatee and this item trims it just fine. Highly recommend it if you are a man with facial hair.
1,Junk,"Piece of junk.Had it 2 weeks and pieces have broken off already so that only one attachment works now.If you never take an attachment off you might be ok,but then you could never clean it.I don't like philips and i don't like norelco so i should have known better."
3,"Used it only 3 times, but seems to be okay for the price!","I have used the grooming system just 3 times I think, but it seems to be alright considering its price. One of the brooming addons broke quite quickly, it is just cheap plastic. Considering its price, 3 stars ""It's OK"" seems to be the right rating for me."
1,"Pulls hair, cheaply made, hard to clean...","Pulls hair,cheaply made,hard to clean,attachments broke after first use,uneven cut,hair attachment broke loose while cutting hair,horrible product will not buy again."
5,This is a great product,"I would just like to say this is a great product it cuts all the hairs without any problems whatsoever, it trims my mustache and it even clips my nose hair. Wonderful product. Thank you"
4,Good for this much money,Good for the money. though it hurts sometimes while shaving and give small cuts. I think you should be little more careful with this one them other as its teeth are very sharp. Close shave is difficult.
2,Ouch!,The trimming system comes with lots of accessories but the razor is a little big so its easy to get cut using it. Will need something smaller for greater detail and less catching.. OUCH!
5,for my son...hates his norelco,"best rechargeable grooming system ever! easy to use, convenient and compact for traveling!better quality than a corded grooming sytem for a spectacular price! amazon is the best!"
4,yea.,Awesome clippers. Although they don't cut skin smooth they don't pull hair. Easily rechargeable and trims PUBLIC hair easily. Thanks.I will buy another for my mustache.
3,Works but not as solid,If you are planning to use this as a hair trimmer for kids then it is not the one. The switch that adjusts the length of cut attachment is too flimsy. Numerous time the whole trim head slides off since the plastic adjustor on top sits too tight on the hair trimmer. Happened 3-4 times while I was trimming my sons hair. ( I do that between his visits to the hair cuttery). Finally I called Norelco and invoked the 45 day money back gurantee and sent it back.
2,Breaks WAY too easily,"I purchased this product because the price was right. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. I have had this for just over 4 months and have treated it no rougher then any other personal grooming device I own. One day, I dropped it in the sink and it is now completely useless to me because the beard trimmer BROKE! I can use the other attachments , but it is now unable to perform it's main task. For $20 bucks, I didn't expect much, but I certainly expected more. I would advise against this product. The build quality of the main unit is solid, but the attachments are flimsy and break WAY too easily. I own other Norelco products, and I have to say they cut corners wherever they can. I hope in the future they put out a line of products that uses quality materials rather then the cheapest they can get away with. I think next time around I will be going with another brand with all my personal grooming devices."
2,for trimming hard/thick beard is not good.,"i have hard beard, for trimming hard/thick beard is not good, suggest me something better than this and cheap product."
2,Deceiving,"I like all the parts that come with the grooming system, however, the picture is deceiving due to no stand to put all the parts in. Now they are just laying around. The previous one I had purchased had the base."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Dear Amazon,If you have a picture of an item, it should accurately represent what will come in the box. This picture includes a very convenient charging stand that holds all the attachments. What comes in the box is a razor, a charger, a bunch of attachments, and a bag. This is the opposite of convenient, and the opposite of the picture. Fix your picture, and expect this item to be returned in the very near future. Thank you in advance for the full refund."
5,I love it .. size and price is very good,I Like it when you compare the price and product. Size is very useful for travailing.
1,Cheap,Cheap. Won't hold a charge for long and can't run off the cord alone. Attachments always popping off when you don't want them to.
2,Same part broke that I was replacing,"My husband really liked this grooming set until the hair trimmer guard broke.He looked around for other groomers and decided that he really liked this one and wanted another.So I bought another groomer for Christmas. He uses this about once every month to month and a half.Today he went to trim and the exact same piece broke off of the hair trimmer guard.Im trying to get a replacement from Norelco since this is under a 2 year warranty and it is clearly a defect in the design.Still, not happy that it broke because he cant trim his hair until I go get something for him to use!"
1,You get what you pay for,"Quite frankly, this is a piece of junk. I'm surprised that Norelco would put its name on it. I received it as a Christmas gift and within a week, the adjustment lock on both the beard and hair trimmer had broken so that I could no longer use either on anything but the shortest length. The trimmer itself is adequate, but not up to Wahl or other basic cutters. The parts are mostly plastic and cheaply made. I would not suggest this cutter to anyone. Either spend more money and get something substantial and durable, or spend the same amount on a trimmer without the frills that is better made."
1,Beware! Trimmer parts break often!,"If this trimmer's parts didn't break so easily it'd be a great tool. However this is my second one that had the gimmicky adjustable trimmer accessory jam and break.Then it becomes unusable. Made with thin plastic, it explains why it's so cheap.A real piece of junk. Don't waste your money. Norelco should be ashamed of ever putting this on the market under their previous good name."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this as a travel razor because it was small and inexpensive with reasonable reviews. It's absolute junk. When I was young I noticed that by Grandpa had little patches of long hairs that he missed while shaving. I figured it was his failing eyesight but now it's all clear to me, he had a razor like this one."
2,Disappointing,"Hi,This costs cheap and also doesn't work good.. it plucks while trimming even after charging it for 12 hrs... The charge too does not stand by for a longer time. Hardly 5-10 mins for every 12 hour charge is maximum. I dont like the product.. To my opinion the more u pay, the better u get.."
1,Trims but will cut you bad.,Attempted to cut my nuts several time and it cuts me every time even when I am being careful. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
5,"Great product, many tools and the most affordable","I purchased this product and have to say that I am extremely happy with it.You get so many different tools in one product, the nose/ear trimmer is great.You can use it for body grooming/ facial hair trimming or hair cuts.I have had this for several months and I haven't had to charge the battery as one charge will go a long way."
4,nice and compact,"So far so good. I haven't used it that much. I found the trimmer attachment kind of glossy because it is a kind of silicon plastic different from the regular attachments that are rough and don't stick in your skin. I bought it because it said in the Phillips website that the battery charger would work on 110V and 220V but the truth is that it will only work on regular 110V, you will need a voltage transformer to take it to Europe."
2,BEWARE!,"It was a little daunting receiving all the attachments to this grooming system. The instructions leave a lot to be desired, and I had to get a magnifying glass (I wear tri-focals) to read some of the instructions and look at the illustrations to assimilate what they meant. Did not feel that they were clear. The first time I used the trimmer, which can be length controlled by a dial, it got stuck on the apparatus it attaches to which is removable so I must use the trimmer in the position that it is dialed. Thank goodness I had dialed it to the length I always use. I am not really excited about the cut it gave or the way the hair looks while growing out. I probably will explore buying another trimmer, and one that does not have all the attachments."
4,very durable,the one I have has worked without any issues for over 3 years now... Bought the same model just incase the first one finally kicks the bucket...
1,Piece of garbage.,Beware this item is useless in my opinion. Too small for hair clipping. Shaver doesnt cut. Do not buy. Too many parts for nothing.
5,hairfree,I was always havng to trim my husband's hairs in his ears.Since he has recieved this he can do the job all by himself.
2,THE STAND IN THE PICTURE IS NOT INCLUDED,"I am disappointed in this product because the pictured stand is NOT included. Unless traveling, the pouch that is included is not convenient. I haven't actually tried it yet due to the requisite 10 hours of pre-use charging time."
2,Norelco Multigroom Grooming kit G370,This is the second Norelco Multigroom Grooming kit I have tried and the second to fail. The first one the attachments broke and the cost of replacements made buying a new one a better option. But the G370 I got in Aug 2011 has now failed due to not being rechargeable any longer. Since it has a 2 yr warranty I may see about using the warranty. But if there is a service or shipping charge then I'll pass. I won't buy a Norelco replacement.
1,Poorly made,"Bought this at WalMart about 3 months ago. Recharged it twice. Performed well enough for the price(I forget exactly how much but it was less than the others on display). Without knowing anything about the competitors' similar products, I bought this based on the price and the BRAND NAME. But the third time must have been the charm because it will no longer recharge. As a result, I no longer associate quality with the name Norelco nor will I buy anything with the Norelco name. Why do companies like Norelco insist on shooting themselves in the foot by including poor products like this in their lineup?"
5,I'd buy it again!,"If asked, ""Would you buy this product again if you had it to do all over?"" My answer would be ""In a heartbeat!""To begin with I read the instructions. I charged the battery for 10 hours before using and it has run flawlessly for a month without a recharge. You can't just leave this plugged in all the time. Basically, run the battery down and recharge for 10 hours.The trimmer is light and feels good in my hand. The attachments snap in and out easily and they are washable. The blades are sharp and do not require oiling.For years I used Wahl trimmers. In fact, I bought one again but when I got it home it didn't work right so I decided to give this one a try. Frankly, there is no comparison. This Norelco is really that much better than any of the Wahl's I've owned over the years.Adendum: It's been 34 months and still running great. Love it!!"
3,It's okay...,"I bought this one after looking forever in futility for one similar to the system it's replacing. It's fairly large, and is fairly powerful, but just not great at doing detailed trimming. It does the large areas of my goatee just fine, but some areas of the mustache are hard to get at well. Not bad for the price, and it does some things really well. I guess it's just hard to replace a tool that did everything the way I liked, and did it for many years."
4,Good Overall & Great Value,"The precision trimmer and the full size trimmer (with comb) work fantastically. I imagine the clippers (being based on the full-size trimmer) will work well too. I found the mini-shaver useless (takes forever to shave anything), and have not tried the nose-hair trimmer yet. Also, the bag is very cheap and I threw it out because it was coming apart.Despite the low quality of some of the other accessories, the core functionality is great, especially for the price, so I'll only take one star off for that. I bought for growing my first beard and didn't want to spend a lot of money on a trimmer. So far I've no regrets or desire to upgrade to anything else. I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't have a trimmer already."
1,Not working anymore,"It worked awesome for the first time, but after the third use it's not functioning at all. The reviews about its malfunctions are totally true, and now I so regret I bought this product"
3,Cheap and good,"My husband likes this grooming set well enough. His nose hair trimmer piece doesn't work, but for the price you really can't expect them all to work. It's a good value, but don't buy it for the attachments."
2,I should have spent a little more,"It lacks more power. when I took the head off I noticed that the spinning thing inside was covered in grease (it's supposed to lubricate the mechanism) and it get all covered by hair, so it's quite challenging to clean it"
5,Norelco All-in-1 - and all you need,The item arrived within a few days. It was in excellent condition and is exactly as advertised. I love the all in one grooming system. It has saved us a bundle on haircuts.
4,Would purchase again,"This grooming tool is well made and works very well for the money. They should include the stand to hold the shaver and trim heads, the last one I purchased had one."
1,Junk. Awful.,"Only problems with this are ... almost everything.- There are actually a confusing number of options and sometimes figuring out which parts go together takes way longer than it should.- There are two head sizes and a guide that fits over each one that controls the length you are cutting too. Unfortunately, in almost all cases, there don't seem to be detents for the settings; the guides just slide. So if you put a little pressure on, you all of a sudden are cutting your beard a lot shorter than you intended.- Got one nasty cut from a bare blade (well, not bare but without any extra guard; the normal way you'd use it to shave your head).- All of the attachments feel cheap and I don't expect them to last.Really sorry I spent money on this."
5,Awesome product,This product is worth every penny. It trims to perfection without any plucking sensation. Also it gives various other accessories which are very useful! Would certainly recommend this to others!
3,"Cheap, tinny, works for emergencies when a quality product doesn't work","Poorly designed in that the button to pop the top off is right next to the switch to turn it on and off. It works okay but the blade doesn't get very close to the skin, so y still have an eighth of an in or so of hair left on the neck after using it. Better to save the money that would have gone toward this and invest in a better one."
2,Poorly Made!,"I bought this to replace a Wahl I had for 15 years but there was no comparison. The trim guides on the Norelco must be their own system because the ""1"" setting is about 3/4 of an inch but should be about 2mm so accurate trimming with this product is impossible - a total waste of money!"
1,Stinkers,I barely used this contraption which has TONS of accessories and LOUSY diagrams and instructions on how to use them. Then several of them broke. DO NOT WASTE A DIME!!!!!
4,"DOES THE JOB , CHEAP, SHIPPED FAST","Great trimmer for the price! Does what i need it to do. I really like how you can use this trimmer while its plugged into an outlet, which is key for me. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,Terrible Purchase,"i don't understand the favorable reviews on this product. The beard and mustache attachment leaves hair much too long even at the shortest setting. If you want the stubble look, forget it. Return shipping charges are almost as much as the product. Buy the Remington MB 200."
4,Good trimmer set for the money.,"I bought this to replace a Wahl brand trimmer. I liked it, but it didn't have a length setting I liked. I've been using the Norelco for a few weeks now. It has a lot of nice options, although the attachments do feel cheap. I can see how the length adjusting mechanism can break, but honestly if you just be a little gentle when using it it will be fine. The foil shaver worked well and painless enough. I wish it would have came with a stand, but the bag works. As for the shave itself it required several passes to get an even look. I had no trouble with precision though and everything came out symmetrical. All in all it does what i need it to do, and more if necessary."
4,Works good!,"Received on time, I just have difficulty in how to use for my goatee. I am not happy with the evenness of the beard. Otherwise it seems just fine."
5,Addition To My Grooming Tools,Excellent buy for the money. I already had a complete set in a stand that I paid 3 times the money for. This just gave me more sharp heads that fit on both motor units.
4,Works Well,"I like this shaver, but the only negative I find all the attachments rather than one hand held unit with a do all. BUT, does a great job"
3,Philips Norelco G370,"Ok overall, however some of the features of the grooming system have very little use. The shaver, for example, does not provide a very close shave at all.Same with some other features. Bottomline - don't hold your breath."
1,The book lacked focus on the Book of Revelation.....,"I was extremely disappointed in the book as to the lack of focus on the Book of Revelation. It seemed as Jack Hayford seemed more interested in explaining why he didn't want the book to be like other author's books written on the subject instead of being clearer of what his intent or purpose was in writing the book. The book seemed to be in a gray area and very unclear. The only truth that I obtained from ""E Quake"" was that Jesus would be with us through everything in our life. Christians know this, and it didn't take 208 pages to bring this new truth forth. Very disappointing!!!!!!"
4,A Revelation of Jesus Christ brings Adoration,"As expected, pastor Jack Hayford does a fine job in the book pointing the reader to Christ Jesus as the focus. In the text, he is clear to point out John's testimony of the Revelation of Christ Jesus is understood with a heart of worship. As John admonished in the Revelation, we are reminded to ""see"" Christ Jesus for Who He is and to ""hear"" what His Holy Spirit is saying to the church. Pastor Jack does a good job of turning our focus upon Jesus, and not the eschatology one often reads or hears when dealing with John's letter. I especially appreciated Hayford's focus on Jesus as the answer for a church found substituting activities for right priorities or promoting religion rather than the grace and glory of God. E Quake is a good read and recommended for those looking to understand Jesus' plan to reconcile the world unto Himself."
5,excellent...,This is probably one of Jack's best books...I've read several. That guy who gave it one star has problems.
5,Don't date anyone until you read this!,"I love this book. It's full of advice that should be followed by any woman who really wants to get married. There ARE good marriageable men out there, but you can waste too much of your precious time on FROGS that will never be one of them. I wasted way too much time--I wish this book had come out about 18 years ago!"
5,An Exciting Book!,"This book proved to be an entertaining police novel.HoustonPolice Detective Stuart Haydon investigates a murder done execution style. He sees signs of Los Tecos,a Latin-American death squad that specializes in political assassinations.Haydonwinds up pursuing this group and they prove to be difficult.Houston,Texas is about to undergo a gang war,Latin style.Haydon is in for the fight of his life.This book shows good knowledgeof police work.You are treated to the Hispanic side of the world of crime. This is a very interesting book that will hold yourattention. Read this. You will not be dissapointed."
5,The Web Wizard's Guide to Flash,"I loved this book. It is rare to have a computer book that you can read cover to cover but this is one. It is meticulously researched and written, with good questions and exercises at the end to test what you learned. The only thing I didn't understand was why there were only answers to odd questions, but it didn't really matter. Finally there were excellent online references for future learning. This is a classic."
2,spider review,"Although Spider is very cute and his friends are also. I found this book confusing, it never focused on one plot. I think there could have been a great simple plot with one of the many things going on in this book."
2,Disappointing....,"I was hoping for a good first release from Chamillionaire....At first look it seemed like a good CD. And despite his um... what.... like 5 songs about hating..... uh.... this CD sucked. Do yourself a damn favor and download the single Turn It Up, which is fire, as well is Ridin Dirty and Fly as the Sky, and you won't be missing out on pretty much anything. I was hoping for a good start on Cham, but most of the CD is unlistenable, escpecially after you hear it twice. Not worth the entire CD, and I was already pissed on the second listen, minus the songs listed."
2,"Really Overated, not Classic.","People got on Chamill's d*ck, this album is really overated, mike jones, paul wall, & slim thugs were better, even though there albums were not classic, there's where alot better. the only track on here that was dope is the one with LIL'FLIP, and scarface, let it rain, aside from that there wasnt nothin speacial. pretty decent, i just dont fucc with chamill."
2,Can't Compete!,"I'm a big hip hop fan, and especially down south music. I just think chamillionaire cannot compete lyrically with the hottest down south rappers these days... Jeezy, wayne, ti, bun b, slim thug, paul wall, luda, and the list goes on. He sounds and looks to much like a lil kid who watched the real g'z do it, then tried to copy that. Maybe it's just me, but i'm not feelin this, or any cham album!!"
1,this sucks,this dude sucks. what he needs to do is go home and get some better lyrics cause they are weak. this dude isnt a gangster. he has been rapping scence 1999 and isn't going anywhere.
4,this album straight,"i admit that chamillionaire surprised me with his ability to dropa good album especially after what mike jones said about him, cham album was better than mike jones album (mike jones album 3 stars). this is definitely a go getter if you like a mixture of rap and singing because i admit, chamillionaire sings on several of those tracks, but it still sounds good, he doesn't mess it up singing, go get this is if you like houston rappers, dont get it if you don't like rappers singing"
5,the sound of revenge,"yo chamillionaire did not let us down on this albumthis album is hot, all the songs in it, if ya aintgot it go cop that u aint gonna be disappointed"
5,Chamillionaire does it again,"Finally people will understand what Houston rap is all about. They'll realize that people from here don't like Dyke Jones, just people that haven't ever heard good Texas rap do. The guests appearances on here are perfect, too. For all you new Chamillionaire fans, this is definately a great place to start, but you should also pick up everything else he's ever put out (Get Ya Mind Correct, Mix Tape Messiah, Chamillitary, CHC The Army, etc.). Look out for that Color Changin' Click album that I'm sure is coming out soon on Chamillionaire's label. The takeover is finally happening."
5,Dope Cd From The Chamilitary Man!,"This cd is full of lyrical attutude, chamillionaires flows are sick, and the beasts are out of this damn world. i would highly recomend this cd to any rap fan, chaillionaire brings back rap to the essence of what it was. Guest apperence include: Krayzie Bone,lil flip,killer mike, pastor troy,scarface, bun b, and lil wayne. GO OUT AND GET THIS CD FROM THE SOUTHS BEST RAPPER.....CHAMILITARY MANE!!!!!!!!!"
5,THE BEST CD EVER!,"You this CD from Chamillionaire will literally make you wanna just buy more more and more. He has a really hot joint called "" Void In My Life"" which is one of the best songs i have EVER heard! But what do i expect from the best in the game Chamillionaire."
5,Best H-Town albume this year,Being from Houston i'm not going to lie I dont really like alot H-town music cuz it's to bling blingish..... But Cham hold's it down bringing gangsta rap to the table as well as the usual bling rap that doesnt suck.....This makes diyke jones and slim thugs cd looks bad Paul Walls was alright.....worth the money check it out...also get zro and e.s.g. albums....
5,"Incredible CD, one of the best to come out this year!","First of all, this cd is incredible. Chamillionaire's voice is easy to listen to and he has a very inviting flow. He commands every track like he is a pro, which he is, he has been holding it down in the south for a long time on mixtapes and whatnot, but this is his major label debut. I highly recommend this cd, because all of the songs are great and Cham has some great hooks. He is a great lyricist and has some great hooks. Standouts include Turn It Up, In The Trunk, No Snitchin, Frontin, Void In My Life, Fly as the Sky, and Think I'm Crazy. I highly recommend that you go out and buy this cd now. That's all I have to say about this incredible cd."
5,Chamillionaire CD Review,I think this cd is hot. It's got the songs anyone will love. I like it a lot. I loved it so much I got it for my sister's birthday.
5,HATAZ BETTA STAY AWAY,"No need in a review so stop reading this and hurry up and buy this album no matter where ur from, u will love it!CHAMILLITARY MANE!!!"
5,To Justin,"Man, u don't have a clue about rap u gave Mike Jones 5 stars over Cham. We all heard Mike Jones'album and beside the singles it's pretty trash. Lyrically Mike Jones and majority of the mainstream rappers can't see Cham, and Cham is a pretty good song writer not just some battle rapper. Check your taste dog cause it's wack."
5,"Chamillionaire ""THE TRUTH FROM TEXAS""",Chamillionaire Sound Of Revenge Is One Of The Best Of The Year.I Love The Album Cause Now The World Can See Texas Being Rep And The South Like It Need To Be Rep. All The Tracks Are Hot Mostly Ridin With Krazy Bone Dats Real..Cham Did That And All Tha Tracks Are Bangin And Then Cham Singin Then Breaking It Down In A Nice Mello Flow with a Message. He Is One Of The Best Out Of Texas 1.Southside Of Texas-(Z-Ro) Northside Of Texas -(Chamillionaire).. Cham Is One That Keep It Real But Gutta And Its All Southern So Cop This Album Its Worth It.. Cham Keep It Up..Im Hold U Down Louisiana Rep. Get That Z-Ro...
1,sorry cham,"This was by far the greatest dissapointing cd that i have bought in years. Before this album chamillionaire was one of my favorite rappers and i believed that he would rise to greatness, but this cd proved me wrong. On his mixtapes is the gritty, street guy from Houston who could beef with the best of them. But this album is about as close a rap cd can come to being pop without actually being there. Sorry cham, but you've lost a fan."
4,It only gets better,"Let me start out by saying that I have always been a true chamillion fan. So I know what he is capable of...at first I was dissapointed by this album, because hearing his other material I knew he was raw with his flow, but I had to realize that everyone isn't fimilar with the delivery of Cham's flow, so I understand why this album is the way it is. Overall I think this album is solid, it opens up very nice with Cham giving us a taste of his lyrical skill and it finishes strong. Cham is truly a talented lyricst and if you don't feel him, them you LISTEN to music. If you want to hear Cham's true unbreakable flow check out his greatest hits 1&2. 4.5 stars in my book."
3,chamiollionaire,"This album's alrite. I expected somethnig great and this was good. Number 11 ""Rain"" is a money track, but the rest are just decent songs. i wasnt that impressed with this album as i wanted to be."
1,LOL!,"Why do people like this sh**? People will eat up anything that is given to them with a cool image, and this album proves that. All mainstream hip hop has gone away from what hip hop realy is. I dont see M.F. Doom and Deltron on the radio, but I know for a fact M.F. and Del would make Chamillionaire look like a bitch. So if you realy love hip hop, stop listing to what is givin to you and go find some great hip hop that has always been around and always be around.M.F. DoomDeltronAesop RockMr. LifJedi Mind TricksPhi Life Cypher"
3,Pretty Good,"I've heard a lot of his underground stuff, so I was expecting bigger things, I guess. It was a great debut tho, but having heard what he's capable of I filed it into my white noise collection. Great choice for the single, though."
3,Good but not as good as the Mixtapes,"Yeah, this CD tight, but not feelin like Imma feelin his mixtapes. Beats tight but he holds back lyrically on this major debut. If you wantin true Cham flow, then u gotta get Mixtape Messiah, Chamillitary or The Truth.For those feelin Cham i gotta recommend getting some 50/50. He was member of tha Color Changin Click, his flow even tighter than Cham and his lyrics dope. He forreal and he gonna blow up."
5,New King of Da Souf,"If u aint got this cd by now u trippin. This tha hottest cd of the yr by far and a southern classic. Dude tha nicest in the rap game right now. F* 50, F* T.I., F*Young Jeezy. Cham got tha rap game on lock. Hes the MJ of rap. U aint even gotta skip a song when u listen to the album u can just let it ride. My favorite tracks on the joint are the joint wit krayzie bone, the joint wit killer mike, the joint wit bun b and the joint wit lil wayne. F* dyke jones. Chamillitary Mane"
5,King Koopa,"Chamillionaire has one of the best albums out right now,Him, Wayne,and T.I are the best rappers in the south.My favorite tracks are1.In The trunk2.The Sound Of Revenge3 Fly As the Sky4.Think Im Crazy5.RidinBut dont get it wrong every track is good."
5,I LOVE THIS ALBUM,AT FIRST WHEN I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM I THOUGHT I WAS SORRY AS HELL I ONLY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I SEEN THE VIDEO TURN IT UP BUT AS I KEPT LISTENING TO THE LYRICS AND WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT I STARTED LIKING THIS ALBUM I LOST A FRIEND BECAUSE OF THIS ALBUM CHAMILLIONAIRE TELLS THE TRUTH AND HE COULDN'T STAND IT HE GET MAD WHEN I PLAYED IT ALOT LIKE THE SONG FRONTIN' HE SAYS YOUR FRIEND TALKING UNDER LOUD MUSIC AND HE THINKS IM GONING TO GET HIM BACK FOR TALKING BEHIND MY BACK BECAUSE THE ALBUM NAME IS THE SOUND OF REVENGE
5,Changing Tha Game,"This one of the best cd's I've bought yet. Chamillionaire comes out the gate 100 miles and running, and stoping. He's got what could the best features on a album. Songs for everyone in tha fam(lol). If you ain't got it, go get it, and that screwd and chopped joint too. Damn I Split My Drink,LOLBeats:5 starsVerses:5 starsPaint drippin,cup slippin,straight pimpin: pricelessRell aka $"
2,Nice ideas but apprentices....,"The book over all I found to be average. (Perhaps as high as 3.5 except as follows.) However, one thing that really needed to be deleted from the book or revised to the extreme is the system for wizards apprenticed to PC's. My biggest issue with the system as presented is that the player can effectively steal experience from the NPC apprentice to make magic items. Does the game really need that many more PC created magic items?"
2,Does not work well with 4th edition.,"A lot of the ideas in this book are interesting, but it's clear that the authors did not think carefully abut the design philosophy. The result is a big burden for the DM.The powers, feats, and classes presented in this book are more in line with edition 3.5, and do not work well for 4th edition. For example, there are many powers that give substantial bonuses to attack rolls, but it is clear that in 4th edition these should be rare. Another example are encounter powers that impose severe save ends status effects, but it is pretty clear that these effects should be limited to daily attack powers.Some of the stuff is okay, but most of it is horrendously overpowered. I doubt much of it was seriously play tested."
2,Great houseshoes,"I was so very excited when I ordered these house shoes, as I have never owned a pair that were this dear in the cost. Indeed they were wonderful, however they did not fit me!! Alas, I had to send them back!"
3,Not what they used to be.,"A bit disappointed. They were very narrow when they were first received. I had to wear them, uncomfortably, a few times before they stretched out to be almost a medium width."
2,Not true to size,"These were soft, looked good but the length was not true to size...had to return. Need to make in half sizes."
4,Around the ring we go,"It was a beautiful ring for the price that was paid. I am very pleased with what I got and I don't know how much can be said about the ring itself. It is shiny and thin prefect for a females hands. I wouldn't put it on a man , a bit too Dainty, Go for the wider ones for a dude."
4,Just Perfect,"My engagement ring had a wide band so I needed a slim comfortable band to go with it. My husband found this one, it looks amazing with my engagment ring and without it! It is so comfortable!"
5,Great Purchase,"I bought this ring for a thumb ring. It's pretty and it's comfortable. It costs a little more than I'd hoped, but it was better priced than other offers that I saw."
2,Pray away the Bully?,"I had no idea this was yet, one more book based on scripture.Why don't these people sell their books in the Christian Bookstore where they belong?For those of us who are agnostic, or even atheists, or who are not Christian, reading remedies based on what ""god would want us to do"" is not credible and makes no sense to us. It just seems like one more way of not taking responsibility for our actions, as if god was going to just take care of it all while we ""trust"" in god to handle things, quietly retreat to church on Sunday to pray. That is nonsense. The Mean person or bully needs to be confronted and made accountable and stopped by US, not god. He/She is NOT going away no matter how much we pray or leave it up to god. What are these people thinking - this is the 21st Century folks."
5,recommended book,A friend told me about the book and I decided to read it. Thinking of having a women's bible study with this book
1,Unstrategic Finger Crossing,Her advice: pray. I don't blame the author for not coming up with better advice because jealous females are very intentional and impossible to dissuade from being nasty.
1,I want my money back!,"If I had wanted a book that was full of Bible versus I would have bought one! I feel that the title mirepresented the whole thought behind the book. It was a waste of money and, if I could, I would return it! I didn't get beyond the first chapter, but the thought that I would ""find having a friendship with women diffucult after being friends with guys"" was insulting to say the least. I have plently of close female friends but was looking for a good read about ""Queen Bees"", etc. I will never again buy a book by this author."
2,not what I expected,"Only 3 of the 6 episodes on the disc were actually about going to school, and my children had already seen all of them on Nick Jr. I wish I had known the names of the episodes before buying the dvd - I wouldn't have bought it. For future interested parties, the episodes are:Dora: First Day of SchoolDiego: Linda the LibrarianBlue's Clues: Blue Takes You to SchoolWonder Pets: Off to School (help the baby blowfish)Wonder Pets: Save the PangarooNi Hao Kai-lan: Lulu Day"
4,My dora,"This video is very informative and interactive, my child like it very much and watches it everyday."
3,Keep an open mind,"I don't recommend this as a first time DK book. All DK fans should read it, though. Fast-Paced, creepy, and a bit on the rushed side. A must read."
4,Makes you wish for a heart attack,"One of the best modern horror stories I have ever read. After the first page it takes all your attention and doesn't let go until some point in the last third, where the story gets a little flat. Sometimes, when someone in the book is in a dark room, it feels like I can't see the text because of the darkness. One of the things that bothers me is the put-on sex scene. Feels like it is there because there must be a sex scene. It doesn't fit to the story at all. But in any other way, a must for all horror/Koonz fans."
3,Not his best work,"Mr.Koontz has done better, but the book isn't really that bad. Basically what you have is a man who is killing people through the practice of voodoo. Those sounds in the ventilation shaft, his little minions. The story was decent but the novel was short, very short. It's almost like the man had a deadline to reach and so he typed out what he could as quickly as possible. If you buy it, don't expect it to be able to hold it's own against some of his other works like Midnight, Watchers, or the servants of twilight."
2,Dean Koontz--Darkfall,"...1984Pages: 371A typical Koontz novel during the 1980s that includes a heroic cop who loves his family more than anything, a love interest, and of course, some evil-doing creature that is terrorizing a big city. Our cop hero is Jack Dawson, a detective who is working with his new partner Rebecca Chandler (who happens to be that love interest) on a puzzling murder case. In the wintery depths of New York City, members of the major drug-traffic organization are all showing up dead--and in gruesome fashion--except that they weren't shot, stabbed, or choked, but ""bitten"" to death. Jack and Rebecca realize that they aren't dealing with a usual killer, but a force that has the power to do much more damage than any human being. This story is certainly too far-fetched, even for Koontz, especially with the added voodoo aspect of the tale and how it eventually becomes the focus of the novel. Only for those dedicated to Koontz."
3,Not the best,"This is the first Koontz book that didnt get 5 starts from me. It took me a month to read it, and it usually takes me a few days.Jack Dawson is one character that you root for no matter what, funny, caring and smart. Rebecca, his partner is nasty, annoying and two dimentional. I couldnt stand her through the entire story.The voodoo aspect of it wasn't horribly scary, maybe only because the ""evil"" could always find it's victim. There was no where to run.THe end is a typical Koontz, end. Wham bam thank you maam. Quick and painless, but this one was just too smooth.Overall not a bad read, but I dont think this book HAD to be written."
5,This is the scariest book I've ever read!,This book is a stay-up-all-night-until-you-finish- then-sleep-with-the-lights-on book. How do I know that it is that scary and interesting? Because it is the only book that ever gave me nightmares.
2,Terrible,The book isn't worthy of Koontz's reputation. Bad storyline coupled with so do characters. Hard to believe hr wrote it. Either he or publisher should offer my money back.
4,Very suspenseful,"This novel definitely creates anxiety. The pacing rushes forward FASTER than an Elmore Leonard novel...and it pulls the reader along. Very nice, but I actually would have liked to learn more about voodoo and why we are supposed to believe that it can manipulate reality the way it supposedly can. I mean, this guy was opening a gate to Hell; can you forgive me my suspension of disbelief issues?"
3,Standard Koontz,"Dean Koontz has been my favorite author for years, but a few of his books seem to follow the same sort of outline: Main character falls in love with someone, they share one or more intimate moments before fighting a very difficult foe (WATCHERS, WHISPERS).<P>DARKFALL marks a pretty avaerage addition to author's oeuvre, but very interesting and worth the read."
5,Awsome in every way!!!,This is my 5th Dean Koontz book and it is by far the best one I've read so far. I thought that this book left the reader in suspense & wanting to know what would happen next. I think that making the shadows and the unknown seem scarier that they might be in actual reality was a great touch to add. I look foward to reading more of his great novels.
3,Kind of corny,I have a good imagination and I still couldn't bring myself to believe in voodoo. I know it's not supposed to be believable but it should be a little convincing.
2,Common lost in the woods story,What i thought about this book is really hard to have to write because i really have liked all of the Dean Koontz books i have read. But Darkfall was just like a old movie about a girl thatis young and is lost in the woods all alone. I do think that the book was written well but i think is should of had more twist to it. I also think this is a book for young students that can read at this level and still understand what is going on in the book.
4,Couldn't Set It Down,I absolutely loved it. It managed to always find itself in my hands and kept me entertained. Wonderful story line with engaging action.
3,I think I've seen this before.....,"The story of gruesome murders that happen in locked and sealed rooms, a love story in the background, creatures from hell, a pit opens up and a devil emerges from it....yes I loved 'Phantoms' by Dean Koontz. Oh, what's that you say? Darkfall? Yeah I love the way he changed the name of the book from 'phantoms' to 'darkfall'. Then he added some goblins and moved it from California to NYC, it was good. I obviously didn't give this book 3 stars because of it's amazing originality, it was good, but if you've read Phantoms you'll sit there comparing the two as I did and think about not finishing the book, just assuming that the main characters come out of this okay. It was a quick book tho, and if you're bored on a rainy sunday pick it up, you'll be done soon."
1,Awful. I wouldn't.,"This is my first Dean Koontz book and I have to say, it was just terrible. The dialog was just pitiful, the characters were shallow, utterly unbelievable, predictable, and incredibly lame. The conversations between the children and Rebecca, the main characters romantic interest, are painful to say the least. Its beyond me how anyone can defend this book. By the end my friends and I were literally laughing out loud. I got this used as a book on tape for a 1700 mile drive and it barely kept me awake. I'm going to give Koontz one more chance, but take it from me this is not worth the time."
2,Not one of Koontz' Best,"On the positive, the Koontz is very good at writing and pacing the chase scenes. But in writing, he seemed rushed in finishing the novel with an abrupt ending. The character's dialogue seemed kind of 'comic bookish' and stale. The main characters aren't well-developed and seem two dimensional. Koontz is good at action, and the chase scene maintained my interest. But, does anyone see any close similarities between this novel and 'Servants of Twilight'? The chase seemed very similar to me, even down to the blizzard. For a better read, I recommend 'Intensity'. I thought this was a much better novel, with better characters and greater suspense."
4,Dean Koontz at his best,Great book full of Deans style of writting. I enjoyied it. would recomend it to any one that likes Deans books
