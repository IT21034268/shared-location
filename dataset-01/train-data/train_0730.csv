2,Somewhat disappointing,"In spite of Johnson's blurb on the back cover, this book in no way 'appeals to the generalist as well as to the Nabokov specialist.' Rather, it is clearly a reworked Ph.D. dissertation and as such has somewhat limited appeal to a broader audience, even in this case to a reader well read in Nabokov criticism. The text is somewhat turgid and plodding. A very tough read that unfortunately rewards the reader with few nuggets of enlightenment."
3,Canada Oh Canada,"This is a slick, well done series describing the border protection actions of the Canadian immigration and customs enforcement group, with a US liaison officer active in most episodes.A previous reviewer stated that there was no anti-US element to these shows, that is clearly incorrect as every episode, at least in season one, has an underlying theme of the big bully to the south and the sensitive and compassionate approach to things the superior Canadians take (other than their political masters who come off very poorly -- and in close cooperation with the US).That said, and if you can ignore the occasional anti-US diatribe, the episodes are tight, well paced with excellent acting and solid direction. The stories are topical and the action is realistic.I would recommend this series as both entertainment, and an education on Canadian intellectuals feelings towards the US."
3,Camera work gives me a headache,"I am a huge fan of the BBC's MI-5 (Spooks), probably my favorite TV show ever. I also enjoyed 24 but it did go a bit over the top toward the end. While traveling in Canada, I saw an episode or two of the Border and really enjoyed it. (Note, I'm not sure what season it was.) So I decided to purchase the first season and watch it. My wife and I just sat down and watched the first two episodes. As for plot, acting, tension, etc., it was OK, nowhere near as good as MI-5, but still interesting. The problem we had with it though is the camera work. In every episode, every scene is the ""artsy"" hand-held camera mode made popular in movies like Blair Witch. And it's not a subtle little movement of the camera -- it's a lot. I literally had a bad headache after watching the two episodes. We both decided we just couldn't watch anymore. Just tonight I tried again with another episode, but I had to look away and just listen. Sigh. I wonder if seasons 2 and 3 had the same problem."
5,THE BEST HARDY BOYS BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the BEST Hardy Boys book I have ever read!! This book is the most suspenceful, and the most action packed book in the series! PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Interesting but not fabulous,"I love Walker Percy but this is sort of mish mash of essays. Some more personal histories of their medical career, some an interesting analysis of medical themes in Percy's novels and essays. A book just for true Percy addicts."
3,young....,"only get this if you have both poison the well albums, because you will think that these guys are a ... garage band. This sounds very different from 'the well' we know now...but the live songs make it worthwhile...pick it up if you find the right price"
2,Boo.,"Ehh, I am not too happy with this recent purchase of mine. I mostly purchased it hoping for something innovative, fresh and inspired, though what I recieved was certainly the opposite. All of the songs seem to drag, with hardly any interesting parts whatsoever. The breakdowns are some of the worst I've heard and the lyrics are a bit too pseudo-angst for my tastes. I'd say the one thing I do like about the album is the screams, for they're executed quite well, though that is the extent of it.I guess if emo is your thing, and you want some elementary heaviness with some screams, this may very well be for you, though if you're looking for something with some depth, definitely look elsewhere."
4,a thought!,"This saw should have a cord holder built in,espescially at this price.Also it should come with a outfeed extension at no extra cost!"
4,Dewalt 744 recall,I bought a 744 after trying out the 745 and decided I would like the larger fence. The 744 I received from an online source (Tyler Tools) had a serious blade wobble and when set at 45 deg. the blade would contact the plate. The box it was shipped in looked as if it been hit by a semi! I called the Dewalt center (Seattle for me) and they traded me for a brand new model which works flawlessly. They told me some versions of the 744x are on recall so watch out. I haven't found any information online about the recall except for a posting in Australia. Had I not been near a Dewalt center I would have been hit with some serious shipping costs so be careful before you order a 744x.
1,Poor rack and pinion design,"I have owned this saw for 3 years and I have constantly had to make adjustments to the rack and pinion ""pillow blocks"" that hold the rod, they are nothing but plastic in thin sheet metal and are prone to bending to the point where the fence will be 1/8"" off from one end to another. DeWalt went super cheap on materials when making this saw, they should have used a hardened rod (one that won't flex) to hold the gears and they should have used solid aluminum with bronze bushings for the pillow blocks. This saw is very frustrating to use every time I go out with it. I used to use an old Makita with the simple fence and as long as I have to check the blade every time with a tape on the DeWalt saw, it makes it no better than anything else out there. Good tools were once made in the USA, not anymore. :(DAVE, California Licensed Contractor 15+ years"
2,Dewalt Dissapointments,"I had purchased a small contractor DeWalt 745 saw. It was a great little saw. But I wanted the larger 744x unit. I need a bigger fence area. Got the first 744 and it had a problem with the rack and pinion fence. It was so tight It wouldn' move. Tried adjusting it via the owners manual to no avail. Amazon shipped another unit and to my dismay it also had a rack and pinion AND fence problem. The fence would hang on the right miter slot. And the pinion gears jumped off the track when trying to adjust the fence. I'm very dissappointed in the factory setup on these saws. Poor quality control. I believe once I get beyond these poor factory quality issues I might have a good saw. But frankly, I would think twice before purchasing a DeWalt saw agaain . . ."
3,DeWalt table saw,I have had one of these for years and the only complaint I have is that the fence will not stay even with the blade. I swapped it out for a new one and it has the same problem.
5,Perfect for me,"I've had several power saws over the years--a big Craftsman table saw and a Skil radial arm. My problem always was I had to keep then in the garage with the vehicles and it was a big hassle to get 'em out, set 'em up and use them, clean up and put them away again. Then I got the DeWalt contractor saw and the DeWalt wheel base that allows the saw to be stored vertically. The best investment I ever made. It takes about three minutes to get the saw out or put it away. Now I use it a lot. It took me a little while to get the blade true in all dimensions but once I got it set it stayed set.Don't bother with that stand that comes with the saw. It's not worth using."
3,BEST ON THE SHELF,"A PORTABLE JOB SITE SAW MUST BE STURDY AND POWERFULL AND THIS SAW IS. THE KNOBED CONTROLLED RACK AND PINION IS THE MOST USER FRIENDLY FENCE OUT THERE COMPARIED TO THE BOSCH OVER TIME ITS FENCE DOES NOT SLIDE HANGS UP PAINFULL AS WITH MOST ALL HAND SLIDING FENCES LIKE THE MAKITA OR RIDGID. THIS SAW IS NOT PERFECT I HAVE BURNED UP 2, SMOKED THEM ASKING TOO MUCH FROM THAT MOTOR. WHEN IT GETS WET AND FREEZES THE FENCE NEEDS TO BE HEATED BEFORE USING."
1,you need what? to do what? Ever ask that ?,"What is the most used and handy hex socket on a job site? 1/4"" 5/16"" 3/8"" 7/16"" 1/2""...... Doesn't matter.... none will help in adjusting the rack and pinion fence parallel. You'll need a 10mm deep hex socket or an extension, & a ratchet handle or an impact driver to crack the adjustment hex nuts. Is there Lock Tite used in factory assembly as well as an impact? Oh wait there's 10 mm box end on the other end of the arbor wrench, nope..... must for the neck bolts on the engineers who spec'd the bolt sizing."
3,Price going up?,I've been following the prices on this saw and other similar ones on Amazon for about a week now. I just clicked on putting it in my cart and noticed the price that was $427.25 has gone up by $20 to $447.25!!! Is it because of supply and demand or what??
3,Cool Debut from Tyrese,Tyrese first burst onto the scene doing that Coca Cola commerical and then he released his first CD. The CD featured two classic slow jams Lately and the sure fire winner Sweet Lady.
3,This CD has only 2 songs that are worth listening too...,"Tyrese is a very sexy man but, image is not everything. Maybe if he was to put as much sexiness into his album it would have been on deck. Love nia"
5,I love this CD it is the best and I also love Tyrese.,"I love the Cd so much I listen to it everyday all day. Also I have recorded it the ""Sweet Lady"" video because I love that song.Natosha Johnson"
4,Talented singer but some songs sound alike...,"I knew from the moment that I heard ""Sweet Lady"" that Tyrese was extremely talented. He has a really great voice and is one of my favorite male R&B singers [although R. Kelly, Brian Mcknight & Joe have him beat]. One problem, a few of his songs remind me a bit too much of one another. My favorite songs by him are his two released singles ""Sweet Lady"" & ""Lately."" His management made good decisions by releasing those two as singles. All in all, he is really talented... I think he and Monica should do a duet. They would sound nice together.Tyrese, if you ever read this, take the Monica duet thing into consideration! :)"
3,Aside from Sweet Lady and Lately- the cd is mediocre,"Aside from the soulful ""Sweet Lady"" and smooth "" Lately"" this cd is mediocre at best. No other song catches my ear- so with the strength of number 4 & 5 I have to rate it a 3."
5,This is a great CD,This is a very good CD. Every song is good.(unlike the Puff Daddy Cd with like 3 good songs) I play it all the time. It is very relaxing to listen to. I recommend this highly to R&B and hip-hop fans
5,"I THINK TYRESE DID A GOOD JOB ON THIS HIT SONG,I LOVE IT!","I THINK TYRESE DID AS GOOD AS HE COULD & SUCEED!HIS NEW HIT SONG ""SWEET LADY""IS LIKE SO H-O-T-T HOT!!!IN BOLIVAR TENNESSEE THE SONG WILL NEVER GO AWAY BECAUSE IT IS SO BUMPING!IF TYRESE EVER COMES TO B-TOWN (BOLIVAR)AND LAY HIS EYES ON THESE B-TOWN GIRLS HE WOULD NEVER WANT TO GO BACK!!!BUT BACK TO TYRESE HE IS LIKE SO FINE TO ME,AND HIS SONG MAKES HIM LOOKS EVEN BETTER!! WELL MY WORDS ARE GETTING KIND OF SORT SO BYE!!!!"
4,hot,"Tyrese is not only a singer,but alsoa performer i like the videos,the dancing,the power of the voice and most important,the message,and lyrics keep it up tyrese."
3,the talent of Tyrese's voice does not reflect in his new CD,"Tyrese's self entitled CD "" Tyrese"" is not what I expected at all. I expexted it to be much better. With the hit songs ""Sweet Lady "" and "" Lately"" basically make the CD. For an artist with such a distinct, sweet sounding voice that ladies just melt over. His materials for the CD certainly do not reflect the abilities in his voice. However the CD is not terrible it just needs a few times listening to, to really enjoy it."
1,This CD is terrible! I hated it!,"Tyrese is so pathetic! I don't even give it one star! But one star was the lowest ranking I could give! Tyrese always tells everyone to buy his CD on Jams Countdown! He thinks he is so cool! Tyrese always trys to rap but he can't rap at all! Tyrese always says ""this next video is from my main man from Cali."" when it is a 2 Pac video. i would be willing to bet that Tyrese never even met 2 Pac. Tyrese also thinks that everyone else is his main man too, the only reason Tyrese says that they are his main men is cuz he wants to be cool even though he isn't"
1,Driven by MTV...,"The only reason this album went anywhere is because of his gig as VJ on MTV Jams. If it wasn't for that, his album wouldn't have went platinum because the material on this album isn't worth it."
5,TYRESE IS THE HOTTEST AND BEST SINGER EVER!!,He is sooooo hot! This is definatly his best CD yet. Tyrese needs to do a US tour!!!!!!!!
3,"Good Debut, but nothing special","Tyrese's release was something I was looking out for, and when he won the American Music Award, I looked for his album. After eventually finding it, I was quite impressed, but it was nothing special. Tyrese is a good singer and will continue to do well, but he (at least at this moment in time) shows no real signs of becoming as great as, say R Kelly or Babyface."
4,study small scale geometries,"Surface plasmons or surface plasmon polaritons [as the preferred term in the text] are used to investigate small scale phenomena at the interfaces between a metal and a non-metal. The diverse topics described by the book continue work done by Kretschmann et al in the 1970s. That latter work involved using the production of surface plasmons to measure the dielectric constant as a function of the frequency of incident light. Where the light created a resonance at the interface, that produced surface plasmons.Much of the book's ideas can be understood as related. Though the geometries studied are now more varied. Especially noteworthy is the use of metallic tips, at which SPPs are made. The tips function as probes of nearby materials. Where the length scales are small compared to the wavelengths of the exciting light."
2,Wasn't very helpful for me,"I'm sure this book has been very helpful for others, but it certainly was not for me. I studied the areas needed in this book and when I got the the test there was nothing from the book on there."
4,No problem,Came in as expected and there were no poblemsThanks for your service. Book was in the condistion as posted.
4,Needed VBA help,Bought this to finish a project at work. This book is a very broad overview as it should be with some practical examples at the end. Worked well for what i needed
3,"Great band, okay CD","If you are a fan of funk ""revival,"" you can't do much better than the Sugarman Three. They are super-funky, and very authentic. This CD however, is only okay. First of all, it could be longer. Some of their covers sound unimaginative, especially ""Papa's Got A Brand New Bag."" There are some strong songs and moments here, but I definitely prefer their CD, ""Pure Cane Sugar,"" a real masterpiece!"
3,upset,"I tried to order hhh 4 screwed and chopped version but when it came in the mail it wasnt the chopped version, i was pretty upset because the chopped version has extras songs and amazon has a no return policy once the product has been opened."
2,fresh n clean medi-cleen medicated shampoo,"My order arrived exchanged, I asked with a picture of Sharpei and what arrived was with the photo of a Pit Bull, who arrived this is not indicated for skin irritation."
2,This CD is pretty bad.,"This CD is very bad. The beat is not good. I can not picture this guy being famous any time soon. ""I Remember"" is the only decent track on the CD. The only reason to buy this CD is if you are a true rap fan and have a litle extra cash to throw around."
3,Opera Glass Binoculars,I bought the burgundy set of these glasses and I love them. The black and gold set that I ordered had a part missing and the company was not able to replace that so I returned it. I was disappointed but I still have the other set which is very nice to use at concerts and sports events. Go O's!!!
3,An Impressive Debut,"Bill McGee's debut is an impressive coming out. The arrangements are clean and smooth. It's becomes apparent that Bill is no new comer to the business with regards to the performances on this disc. His version of the Minucci hit ""My Girl Sunday"" is excellent as is Nadia's Theme. The stand-out track is the title song, ""This One's 4U"". Congratulations Bill you're on your way sir!Cedric JamesLate-Night Host98.9 Smooth Jazz KWJZ Seattle"
3,A Good Introduction to the Basics,"This course is a brief introduction to conversational Hindi. Thus, it would be good for someone trying to get by in Hindi, like a phrasebook. You will not learn enough to have a very good conversation or master the language. The course has two audio cassettes and a booklet that cover the most important words and phrases."
1,I'm not sure of the point of this,"I'm not really sure of the point of this course. It's supposedly more than phrasebook, but all it seems to do is throw phrases at you, let you repeat them, and hope that that approach will somehow teach you Hindi. It will make you a very good parrot, but it does nothing for understanding."
5,Best little oven ever built,"I got my Euro Pro about 4 years ago and used it constantly in my home. Now that I am traveling around in 5th wheel - would not be without. I bake, broil, toast in it - very rarely have to use my propane oven if ever. The unit is small enough to fit snugly on the counter so doesn't take up a lot of space I don't have. This is one appliance you can't go wrong with"
2,NOT VERY GOOD,I purchased this through Amazon and found that it wasn't as good as claimed. It does not toast bread well and takes a LONG time to do it even with the convection feature. I am sorry I chose this one. My old one was much better even though it was well used and worn looking. Very dissappointed.
2,Cheap plastic toys,This was definitely not our best buy ever. The toy is cheaply made and all the little suction cups fell off the darts within the first week. Not that it mattered as they never stuck to anything to begin with. It took all of three weeks for the toy to break in another spot.
3,maybe go see this movie...,"If you have kids, and don't mind pint sized jokes. I'll admit, it was kind of funny, but Frankie Muniz is kind of annoying, no matter how funny the script is. Amanda Bynes was totally awesome though. She is very funny, and it doesn't seem like her jokes are so forced. Like I said, this is a kids movie, but all members of the family will find something to laugh at."
5,A very enjoyable movie,"A very enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours. This is not a back handed compliment in any way but my 5 year old was glued to the screen and at his age he's not supposed to understand all the nuances of a movie, but this movie is so simple and direct that he had no problem following it, way past his bedtime too.It's a hark back to the times when good guys were good guys and bad guys were bad guys and you definitely tell who was who (no silly de rigeur twists). An over the top acting job for Wolfy but the character asks for no other. Nice to see Lee Majors, as a stuntman no less, no doubt many will miss the significance of that. And the wunderful(sic) Donald Faison before Scrubs.Overall, very enjoyable for the younger and older viewers. (You see, I don't know who Amanda Byrnes and Frankie Munoz are.)"
4,Cute movie,"Not normally my type of fare, I watched Big Fat Liar with a younger cousin and was hooked immediately. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes' are really likeable and Paul Giamatti is excellent as the bad guy. This movie is a bit cartoonish and unbelievable at times (living in the prop department is just not happening), but it is a lot of fun to watch."
3,Not a blockbuster hit but watchable,"I bought the DVD of this movie a long time after its release, after hearing how awesome it was. It was cute and funny and all that but I don't think it was anything very special. It seemed to me like it was not Frankie Muniz's best work. He was loads better in the agent cody bank movies. Still, it's a fun family movie and kids from the ages of 5 to 10 will like it."
3,Bought it for the kids.,"I bought this for the kids because they love it. The only thing that made this movie okay was Paul Giamatti's acting the part of Marty Wolf. However kids like this movie a lot! Most adults will find it fun enough a time or two, but after that, there are better things to do than watch this movie."
3,This Movie is all right,"This movie is okay, but I have seen several other movies that are a TON better than this piece of rubbish. I DO sort of admire this movie as being in my top twenty favorite movies, but I HAVE seen ones that are a WHOLE LOT better than this garb."
4,"Pleasant break from tiring ""integrity"" flicks ;)","We took our children completely prepared to hate a sophomoric and unintelligible blend of bad music and bad humor in the name of good parenthood.We were very pleasantly surprised to find that, including of course the requisite scatological jokes and blatant sight gags, the humor was well timed and quite a blast. Even my wife who REALLY HATES bad comedy was laughing loud and long. We have 7, 9 and 11 year old children and we are pretty protective about what they see - this was just fine. They thought it was great as well and had a marvelous time.Wrap up: great brainless and reasonably safe fun for you and the kids."
3,Great movie...bad DVD,I HATE fullscreen movies. This movie only comes in fullscreen!! Why? The movie is great. My kids love it. My wife loves it. I love it. The DVD lacks one very important thing... a widescreen version. I have already bought it not knowing this and now I am seriously considering boycotting all companies that continue this practice. Give us less frills and both (full and wide) choices on the DVD. Don't movie companies realize that people who have home theaters as well as HDTVs are the ones that buy more movies on average than others?
4,A kids movie that you won't mind sitting through,"We took our 9 year old to see this ...She absolutely loved it - she and all the other kids in the audience screamed with laughter many times during the movie.There were definitely things that were very funny for adults as well - I laughed out loud several times myself.We all enjoy Frankie Muniz in Malcom in the Middle. My wife and daughter have been Amanda Bynes fans for years (she has been on Nickelodeon for some time). I personally find her a bit annoying - however quite talented in this film.Paul Giamatti (possible misspelling) stole the show - this was probably his best performance to date. He was way over the top, way funny and quite amazing. Really excellent comedic performance on his part.I only looked at my watch 3 times during the course of the film! The last kid flick I sat through had me looking at my watch every 5 minutes."
1,"Vulgarity in the name of ""harmless fun""","This video was being shown to a group of kids when I went to pick up my daughter at her school's aftercare program. She was doing her homework, but glanced at the movie from time to time.The scene I saw was of an adult male in a bikini bathing suit wriggling, shaking, and wiggling before jumping in a pool. The pool had a blue dye, and the almost naked man emerged with his body dyed blue. Then, because of the kids' prank, his hair was dyed red. Then a mob of screaming children charged him, knocking him to the floor, and were shrieking delightedly at their victory. Male nudity (except for private parts), pranks, blue dye, raucous shrieking, and that utterly vulgar and tasteless wriggling, shaking, and twisting by the adult in a bathing suit....! This is pop culture. It's deemed harmless by most. To me, it's disgusting and should be burned. Sorry fans."
1,Negative 20 stars.,"CRAP.That's all I can say for this annoying movie, Amanda Bynes is a pain in the a** once again.If I had a wider range of ratings, then I would give it -20 stars out of 5."
4,Higer quality kids flic,Not as dumb as it looks. Actually can hold itself up and is pretty funny. Enjoyable and good acting by Muniz and Bynes.
5,Pleasant Surprise!,"You're probably thinking, ""this is probably just another one of those cheesy movies that is worth less than the crud in my shoe."" Wrongo. This is a fantastic & clever movie, with an interesting plot. Only the fact that it would never happen in history & bad acting in about a 1-minute period (back at the base during phase 4. watch it to understand) dent this movie from being perfect..Get it today!"
1,Less than zero,"I would like to see this DVD but I'll wait till it hits HBO. Why should I waste my money to see half the movie. It's not the movie. Full screen is half screen and I won't pay for it. The studios better figure it out and quit this half screen only releases. Too bad, I would have purchased this movie"
1,Big Fat Flop!,"This movie was absolutely horrible. Frankie Muniz acts great in Malcome in the Middle but this and the last piece of junk ""My Dog Skip"" he acted in takes the cake. Big Fat Liar Ha! Kid meets a older version of himself and has to compete against him for his life. That concept has been done already in previous movies and TV shows thank you. Throw in a couple of hasbeens nobodies an average stereotype friend, a few stunts that came off of ABC's 1 Saturday Morining cartoons and what do you get? A movie that makes people laugh? No indeed. Instead a grade F film that makes money for Hollywood. Amanda Bynes can act but she keeps throwing in horrible oneliners that sounds like it came from the Annoying Amanda Show. Frankie Muniz is a great actor but his part as Jason is worthy for the Golden Turkey Award!"
1,Big Fat Liar -- BIG FAT RIPOFF!!!!!!! (FULL SCREEN ONLY),"This review is not about the movie Big Fat Liar, but about the DVD. If you're planning on buying the DVD of this movie, DON'T!!!!! IT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT!!!!! Universal Studios decided not to release this movie in Widescreen format (was it because the movie was a big fat flop?), so if you have a HDTV or any similar TV that supports 16 X 9 viewing, Big Fat Liar is a big fat ripoff.If you see a ratio of 1.33:1, that's full screen. That's no good.SHAME ON UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FOR RIPPING OFF THE CONSUMER. I'm glad I found out about this information before I shelled out $20 to purchase this DVD."
5,Wrong track listing for this original recording,"The review that you see which lists tracks for a 2 disc Recording is for Superfly (25th Anniversary Deluxe Ed.) [Original Recording Reissued, Original Recording Remastered]Curtis Mayfield | Format: Audio CD does NOT apply for this 1 disc page listing for this original recording of Superfly which only has 9 tracks.This page is the original Motion Picture Soundtrack written and performed by Curtis Mayfield in 1988 on Curtom Records of Atlanta and distributed by Ichban Records. The ISBN is: 019011200224 It is NOT remastered, it does NOT have extra tracks. There are 9 nine tracks on this album as originally sold in 1988.1. Little Child Runnin' Wild Time 5:232.

Superfly Time 3:55"
3,Inexpensive and cheap,"I was really excited to get this bag in the mail, I ordered 6 of them for my bridesmaids, but was kind of disappointed with the color. I ordered the light blue color thinking it was really light pale blue, but it came back more of a sky blue color (a bit darker than I wanted). I'm deciding whether or not to return them... it's such a hassle to return things bought from online. PLUS they are huge bags, A little bigger than I expected. Again, inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. It looks cheap."
2,NOT WATERPROOF,"I specifically did a search for waterproof bags on Amazon and this came up. I purchased this for the purpose of storing toiletries in our suitcases for a flight to Florida. I wrapped plastic bottles with liquid in ziploc bags and put them inside the large tote. Well, one of the bottles containing Witch Hazel came out of the bottle, out of the ziploc and went RIGHT THROUGH this tote to the inside of the suitcase. I'm glad it was just Witch Hazel and caused no damage. After that I put the Witch Hazel inside 2 ziplocs and it made it through the return trip without spilling out into the rest of the suitcase. I am upset that these totes were marketed as WATERPROOF when they ARE NOT!! These bags are not suitable for the purpose that I bought them, but I can use them as totes for other things. There are a nice large size."
3,"not quite what I expected, but not bad","This bag is a good size and well made. A good buy for the price. It is not a heavy duty nylon, but durable nonetheless."
3,Tote Bag,"I do like this tote bag! But I was hoping for more. I use it to carry items back and forth to work every day. It's a great size, lightweight, and has comfortable straps. I just wish it had some 'compartments' or 'dividers'. All the little things tend to get jumbled up and I have to root around for them. Even some of the larger items I carry, like folders, tend to slip down instead of standing up."
4,it's OK,"For the price I am disappointed the straps don't go all the way around the bag, thus the straps could pull out. But the size, color and material used was of good quality. I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get and I will be continuing my search. I embroder our bags for our guests as a gift. My prior bags all had a small zipper pocket on the inside and I would like to return to that style."
1,Never Again!,"""Ordered this item to use as a carry on bag to get on a plane. 1st I did not get a shipping e-mail untill two days after the date when it was suppose to ship on amazon. Then after waiting for almost a week I get an e-mail saying this order has been cancelled by the merchant. So I have been waiting a week for nothing! I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN! THEY DON'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR!!"""
4,Shoulder tote with zipper,"I am very pleased with this shoulder tote, especially because it has a zipper and is waterproof. I have a Home Health Care business and have given it to my nurses for safely carrying their equipment."
2,Who is rating this product 5 stars????,Buyer beware. Very cheap tote and can purchase one like it in the store for under $5. I was so disappointed that I returned two and the shipping for 2 cost me over $8 (non-refundable.) Also I was not aware but returns are charged a 15% restock charge.Hard to believe some of these 5 star reviews.
3,Bigger than it looks,The tote is a lot bigger than it actually looks in the picture. The material looks very cheap. Its an ok product all together. Can be used for shopping or travelling.
2,Not what I really wanted...,"This tote would be perfect for the beach or to keep in the car filled with lots of extras for the kids. I was looking for an inexpensive carry on bag and it's really way too large for what I wanted. I should have paid more attention to the measurements since the tote was described; instead, I purchased based on the picture and a few reviews. The tote is inexpensive, so I'll find a use for it, but am still searching for that perfect carry on bag!!!"
5,all the songs i've been searching for,"i have collections of the corries, the tannahill weavers, silly wizard, and, oh yes, a scotch-irish mother, so i know almost all of the songs in this book already.which is fine when i'm singing a capella. not so fine if there's a pianist or guitarist in the offing.these are NOT arrangements--thank goodness. the words and melodies are here, with chord progressions marked, so a guitarist or pianist who's worth the name can supply an accompaniment.even with my other books of scottish songs, there is almost no overlap. and, oh joy oh rapture, it has jeannie robertson's 'son david.'first rate selection--can't understand why it's oop. if you sing scottish, you need this book."
3,Overrated,"After hearing positive reviews, I gave Wide Swing Tremolo a chance, and I was horribly disappointed. The panegyrics offered up at the altar of Jay Farrar's voice seem ridiculous, given that his atrocious enunciation renders every song incomprehensible. If it's country-rock you want, get yourself a copy of ""Clear Impetuous Morning"" by Jason and the Scorchers."
2,"Lethargic, dull album that soured me on Son Volt","I'm a big fan of Uncle Tupelo and thoroughly enjoyed Son Volt's ""Trace,"" so I was looking forward to delving deeper into their catalog with this album. The first time I listened, I liked ""Straightface"" and ""Medicine Hat"" a lot, but nothing else left much of an impression. I figured ""Wide Swing Tremolo"" was one of those albums it takes a few listens to get into. Well, after lots of attempts, I still can't get into it. In fact, the songs seem to get more lethargic and boring with each listen. There's just no life to this album aside from the two tracks I mentioned above. It actually turned me off from exploring the rest of Son Volt's music and Jay Farrar's solo stuff, no matter how great ""Trace"" is."
4,Better with each listen,"This band leaves their fans slightly disappointed with each record because they show absolute, stunning flashes of brilliance leaving us wanting more. Wide Swing is no exception.In any event, this is a very good record; highly recommended. Not quite on the level of Trace for kick-back value, but so much better than 99% of what else is out there - including the very downbeat and maudlin Wilco."
2,May kill bugs because the door does not close properly,Bought this for my 6 year old. Same problem as a lot of reviews have said. The door/slider does not stay flat and you can squish the bug pretty easily if you were trying to scoop it up from a flat surface.
5,My son loves bugs,"My kid loves this. Its larger than it looks. Still ,its hard to catch a bug but once you do you can examine it and kindly let it go."
4,This baby has already saved a few spider lives.,"It's only been a few days and few spiders already have already been saved using this fun gadget.Spiders that normally would have been squished, smushed or squashed are now scooped up, observed and released into our neighbors yard, an experience that must be something of a nightmarish alien abduction for them.I do have one qualm. The flap that slides out and is supposed to go under the spider is slightly folded upwards in the middle, this can result in pushing the spider to the front wall instead of scooping it up with ease. Eventually any bug will walk over the yellow flap at which point you can slid it shut. The device would be perfect were it not for that one flaw."
2,"Hands free bug catching, sort of...","The sliding door on our catcher was warped when we opened the package, so a bug is able to sneak out the corner. Even a perfect sliding door wouldn't be simple to use by a child (mine is 8), and close without losing or harming the bug. The magnifying glass distorts the image. My child caught the bugs by hand and tried to coax them into this catcher. There are plenty of 'bug keeper' type boxes that would have been better than this catcher which didn't work for us."
4,Personal Triumph,"This book is a moving account of one woman's personal relationship with God. She tells us about knowing God, questioning God, and rediscovering God. Good or bad that happens to us is a result or a consequence of choices we make. Her story reinforces that God is in our daily lives and what happens when we choose to ignore God."
4,esta cache,"para all my merengue listeners this is a must buy. this album just goes to show that this is puro ""oro solido"""
1,Un libro lamentable,"La autora trata de presentar una novela historiaca basada en la vida de dos mujeres piratas. Nadie creeria que con una idea tan buena se pudiera escribir una historia tan mala, pero asi es. Da verguenza ajena leer este libro. Esta llena de incongruencias, de principio a fin. Las pretendidas aventuras de las protagonistas estan llenas de dialogos insulsos y tontos, lo cual termina por volver la trama en algo aburrido, por no decir indignante."
5,enticing,"Zoe Valdes draws you into a world of adventure and mysticism with this tale of two female pirates in the Caribbean. She nevertheless acknowledges the hardships of what it was to be a female in a world of men and violence, a world apart from the social standard and expectations of the period. Her style of writing draws you in and entraps you in this interesting story based on real people."
1,A very childish approach,"I still don't understand how a book so full of inconsistencies and errors could be published (a piece of rock floating on the water?!! A Victorian piece of lingerie in the 1700's?!!). The characters are also like caricatures. The situations, ridiculous. Don't waste your time or your money."
4,Mother's little helper.....,"This book is not only great for the recipes, it is great for giving you an idea about variations and substitutions if you don't have something in your pantry. It gives you a limitless list of things your can do in a very short period of time. A must have for the working mom."
2,Very Disappointing Results,"In regards to this book, I have to admit that I was disappointed and couldn't wait to be done testing my three recipes so I could move on to another cookbook. The results were mediocre at best, and while I'm all about quick meals that come together in a hurry I also need my food to actually taste good too. The recipes are based entirely on the idea of using frozen and canned vegetables, jarred sauces and dried herbs, all in the name of putting food on the table in record time. But unfortunately much of the flavour and depth that I have grown to love in my food was missing. Needless to say this book will be disappearing from my shelves."
5,Crushing grooves and great visual lyrics w/ a laid back feel,"This is now one of my favorite CD's. From the driving groove of ""rolling"" thru the off the cuff feel of ""circles"" to the audio mayhem of ""the incumbent,"" Soul Coughing still maintains their unique sound. I bought $70 worth of CD's two weeks ago, loaded my car's changer and El Oso is all I can listen to now. ""Lo-Fi Allstars?,"" what was I thinking!? As a songwriter and producer I rarely find music that sounds new to me. Soul Coughing is DA BOMB."
1,a waste of money for electronic garbage,"This CD is nothning more than electronic garbage being marketed as music. I find it hard to believe that anyone could rate this noise above a one. What ever happened to lyrics that had meaning, singers who could sing, and melodies sounding like music?"
4,Good CD - but some stupid songs,It's pretty good - worth it if you like Blame and circles and Misinformed.. but if not don't waste your time.
4,Not the greatest recording from Soul Coughing,"Let me first say this clearly: I LOVE SOUL COUGHING.There, that's out of the way.That said, I must say that ""El Oso"" is NOT up to their normally high standards for their music. The grooves are not nearly as infectious as on their other albums, the musicianship isn't quite up to snuff, and for some reason it feels like the disc's production quality distances a listener from that fat, up-front Soul Coughing sound somewhat.If you're not yet a fan, PLEASE do yourself a favor and start with ""Ruby Vroom""...that will give you a taste of what Soul Coughing is capable of. Later on you can try out ""El Oso,"" once you've gotten a feel for the band.Remember, I LOVE SOUL COUGHING.I really do."
2,Average.,"I don't really know if I like it, I heard Circles and was really expecting a lot, I listened to the whole thing and liked about 3 songs. I felt bad, cause I spent money on it and was expecting so much. But, I do think Soul Coughing is a talented group. It was an unusual buy for me, a person who buys mainly punk/ska, it just wasn't my style. Don't let me convince you, listen for your self and you decide."
5,i'm hooked,"i have never even heard a song until now. i happened to come across it in resale shop. i was so impressed with their originality. very funky, a little taste of techno. i haven't taken it out of my cd player. you can't really be in love with an inantimate object, but i am. one of the best cd's i've ever heard. now i just need the other two. i'm completely hooked."
3,"Soul Coughing change a lot, but don't loose their idenity.","I love Ruby Vroom and Irresistible Bliss. Those are damn fine albums! This one is very different. Soul Coughing has gone pop. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. On tracks like ""Bus to Beazlebub"" and ""Paint"" Doughty had a lot of alternative chops and a white rapper thing going. Now the guitar work is bouncy and catchy and go are the lyrics. Just listen to Monster Man, Circles and Blame. The vocals sound like a chord arrangment. It works. But I miss the old Soul Coughing. I do get a kick out of some of their new style. Houston and $300 are good for driving to work in the mourning. I have to admit that I like to sing a long a little bit, but not usually to Soul Coughing albums. All in all: They did so many new things that aren't really Soul Coughing, but they did keep their obscerity. Monster Man, The Incubent and Pensacola are all weird. I may like the other two albums better, but they did do something new and pull it off well."
4,their weakest,"of the three Soul Coughing studio albums, this is undoubtedly their weakest. yeah, maybe their closest to a hit with ""Circles"" but spotty overall and not littered with classics in the way that Ruby Vroom or Irresistible Bliss are. ""St. Louise is Listening"" is a classic SC track, however."
5,A great Album For All Fans Of SC!,"It is simple if you like soul coughing you will like this album.It has all the same things we have come to expect from the band we love and know so well.Thundering bass from Saby,great drum work from Yuval,fun samples from Mark and great mind bending poem-like speech from MR. M Doughty(my hero).If you are willing to open up your mind you will find a nice little hole where Soul coughing is supposed to be and always will be if you listen to them.For all you new people,will you please try something new for yourself,you will thank me if you do.Over all soul coughing is fun,odd and just a tad druged out.Buy it and OH POPPY for all!"
4,El Oso... more than so-so,"The focus has moved from jazzy, quirky vocals to more rhythmic, perhaps more mainstream songs. Their first album had lyrics and vocals that were groundbreaking, but their music demanded a lot from you. This album's lyrics seem less edgy, the sound has a little more guitar, less sampling, its a little easier to listen to. But having said that, this album is still better and more interesting than most music out there, a must for your collection."
4,SO-SO,"Production has improved on this CD. THe voice isn't as nasal.more variety on the drums, not just funky drummer over and over.be warned this is more of a alternative rock pop record. not very progressive or interesting.i was hoping for the vocalist to pick up some real hip hop mc skills. or progress on laurie anderson or saul williams. nope. he's retreated into singing.at least the beat problems been solved.not bad. not too great either"
2,Less sound and originality than previous albums.,"I was utterly unimpressed with this album. From past recording from M. and the gang I expected much more sound and energy. But, when I heard el oso, it sounded much like the over-produced pop junk playing on popular radio. If you're a fan of the guys because of their eclectic style and strange akward musical grace, this album is a letdown."
5,LUV IT!,This is a great CD with a great all around sound. If you don't have it you should get it! It's Great!
3,Not What I Expected,"Soul Coughing has now totally abandoned the beat-poetry hipness of Ruby Vroom instead of just avoiding it like the did on Irr. Bliss. The uninitiated shouldn't bother with this one, and neither should the real fans unless they are willing to give Cough the benefit of the doubt, which they really do deserve. Songs like $300 and Misinformed may be okay, but where is the Soul Coughing of old? Also, this time the lyrics really ARE pretty much meaningless. Not much deep poetry in this one, but more radio-friendly quasi-hiphop (which they ARE good at, but...)."
4,Once Again Soul Coughing Spit Funky Originality,"Soul Coughing are one of those few groups you can't put into a genre. They only style they seem to mimic, even the slightest, is their own. This disc adds is a bit more uptempo and even a bit more catchy than ""Irresistable Bliss"", which was very cathy in its own right. Songs like ""Rolling"", and ""I Miss the Girl"" get me boppin along in my seat every time. Then there's the radio friendly ""Circles"" which had to be surgically removed since it stuck in my head after its first listen. If you are looking for the same old shee, then Soul Coughing is not the band for you. If you're looking for infectious grooves and an all around fun time, El Oso is a safe bet."
2,Ship this one,"The earlier Fool books offered tasty nuggets (though sometimes in a rambling, self agrandized way). I think the only real nugget in this one was ""don't pay for your kids' higher educations. This is when you need to be stockpiling for yourself. That's it!"
5,Million Dollars of Sound Advice,Great information for the investor who is looking for a sound way to select stocks and watch their portfolio grow.
1,NOT for a 2002 Yukon Denali,"I'm sure these brake rotors would have worked perfectly for the truck they were designed for. However, Amazon's tool to verify the product is indeed for your vehicle did not work in the case of my 2002 GMC Yukon Denali. These rotors were NOT for that truck. The 2002 GMC Yukon Denali has a 6 bolt lug pattern, these rotors have an 8 bolt lug pattern and will not fit that truck. These rotors are for a 3/4 ton vehicle, not the 1/2 ton that the 2002 Denali is. These were returned and another set of rotors were bought locally for the vehicle. Before you buy these rotors, check the EBC website to verify they will fit your vehicle."
2,When a good idea goes bad...,"The Borgias in a spin on the Snow White/evil stepmother story - how couldMirror Mirrorfail to be interesting? Especially in the hands of someone who spun the Wizard of Oz story on its head so well inWicked? Alas, alack - this one was as disappointing as the Wicked sequel,Son of a Witch: Volume Two in the Wicked Years(see below). It was just, well, dull. It felt half-hearted and was slow-paced. It seems to me an author would have to actively work to make the Borgias, with all their drama and backstabbing and intrigue, boring. Well, work he did."
3,It's ok,"This book is interesting, but a little boring. Read it after the Wicked series and didn't think it was quite as good. Absolutely loved the Wicked series. Expected this book to have a twist in the story like those books where Maguire switched up the good and evil roles. This book pretty much kept those roles in line with the fairy tale I've heard all my life."
2,Not Up to Maguire's Standard,"This book was just awful. Two stars for creative approach only. I LOVED Wicked (all three) and Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, and I forced my way through this out of some miguided? sense of loyalty, and the vain hope that it would turn out to be great after all. Ugh, it didn't. It was slow, dull and ultimately not satisfying. Definitely not up to the thought-provoking standard I have come to expect from Gregory Maguire. Skip this one..."
2,Disappointed,"My first experience with a Gregory Maguire book was Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, which I thought was beautifully written and enjoyed very much. Since this was another re-imagining of a classic fairy tale, I had high hopes for it as well. But I was very disappointed. None of the characters were very appealing, and some of the ""earthier"" elements really did nothing to advance the story. The most interesting characters were the dwarfs, imagined as a sort of amalgamation of human and stone, which I did find creative. Otherwise I felt this one was a waste of time."
1,Boring,"I have tried many times to read this book. I got to page 50 or so this time and stopped. It's slow-moving and confusing, which is a difficult combination. I haven't tried his other books, nor do I think I will."
3,Not the fairest of them all,I've been looking forward to the newest Gregory Maguire novel for quite some time. I loved Wicked and Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister but this one left me wanting something more from this story. I never felt any connection with any of the charaters and I didn't find amusement at a clever turn to a familiar story. This had all the elements to tell the old tale of Snow White from a different view point but there was never a firm grasp of one person as the main story teller; the story was too fragmented. I thought it was a great idea to put Lucrezia Borgia in the wicked stepmother role but there wasn't enough done with it. The view point of the dwarves also had great potential that was never fully developed too. All in all I was disappointed in this novel but it was still an interesting take on the story. If you haven't read any of Maguire's work I would suggest reading Wicked instead.
3,Good fairy tale for grown ups,"This is the first book that I have read by the author, even though I own others. After seeing ""Snow White and the Huntsmen"" in theatres and researching for my thesis (on fairy tales and childhood development) I thought this would be a perfect time to pick up Mirror, Mirror. It's a quick read and was pretty entertaining. There was an air of mysticism about it, but I wish it was a bit more fantastical. There wasn't a whole lot of character development on Snow White's character (""Bianca"") --instead, there was much more focus on the witch (""Lucrezia""). I also had hoped that there would be a more romantic quality to the story, but the main theme of the book bordered on religious duty/innocence vs. malevolence. It was a good read, all in all, and left me with a new perspective with regard to the original Snow White tale. I also very much appreciated bits and pieces of historical information - i.e. the Borgia family and various areas within Italy."
3,A detour from the classic fairy tale,"After reading both ""Wicked"" and ""Son of a Witch,"" I was expecting ""Mirror, Mirror"" to follow in the same footsteps - a different look at the Snow White fairy tale. If this is what you are looking for, you will be disappointed. I had a hard time getting into the book and I kept waiting for it to circle back around to the original Snow White story. Other than the fact that the character Bianca does spend years with the rock ""dwarves"" while sleeping, that's about as close as it gets. That being said, if you can read this novel just for what it is, you will enjoy the unique and political writing style that Maquire is known for. FYI - a little knowledge of Italian and Venetian terminology wouldn't hurt either."
3,No big surprise,"I love Wicked, but had a hard time with Confessions... We chose this book for our book club. I did not find it slow and difficult to get through as others have, but I did find the storyline strange. I enjoyed the historical aspect with the inclusion of the Borgias, but the whole dwarf thing was just plain weird. Too many metaphorical innuendos going on - I just didn't get it. There were some surprise endings - again, related to the Borgias - but, let's face it, we all know the story of Snow White and the ending was no surprise.I think I liked Wicked better because eventhough Maguire used a well-known storyline and character, he didn't present the story that we all knew. He had to invent events that happened before the story we are familiar with. He didn't retell a tale already told. While all of his stories take a lot of creativity, on his part, reading about something so familiar yet so strange and different can be confusing and uncomfortable."
1,Very Confusing,"I'd like to give this book a decent review but that would be impossible because I didn't understand half of it. The dwarves were some sort of rock people that had to come to life. I didn't understand this were they rocks or people how does that work. There was a plot with the father that really seemed to drag along. The author took 300 pages to tell a story that could have been told in 50 pages. The author tried to stick historical characters in there but I don't know why, and I didn't know who the Borgias were until I looked it up. All together this book was very weird. It was a good idea but was poorly executed."
1,Sick and twisted,"The Snow White story, as told by a dirty old man. The author lets the story play out against an actual historical and geographical backdrop--an intriguing idea. But I found the stream-of-consciousness style rather dull and the preoccupation with sex disgusting. For all its invoking of history and pretentions of art, this book was a simple waste of my time."
1,"Loved Wicked, Hated Mirror Mirror...","I'm an avid reader and this book could not have been more boring. There was nothing engaging about the characters. It should have been called The Life and Times of the DeBorgia Family since that was primarily what it was about. I would only recommend this book to an insomniac...it put me to sleep after one page EVERY night. Even at the end I was still going ""huh?"" and yet so relieved!!!I'm reading Confessions... now. It has already started out more interesting than the entire novel Mirror Mirror."
1,Yawn.,"i was impressed by Mr. Maguire's ""Wicked"" and thought that his retelling of Snow White would be just as imaginative. WRONG. i couldn't keep myself interested. The pacing is so dull and you don't really get a 'feel' of what's to come at all. Not worth the paper its printed on."
2,So-so,"Mirror Mirror was quite the flop; it moved very slowly and didn't provide fresh/inviting twists to the familiar tale, as he did in Wicked or Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister. Still, he writes lyrically, which is worth something."
3,Not as great as his other works,"After reading Wicked and Confessions...this book simply doesn't live up to Maguire's star status. I haven't been able to locate a worthy Snow White adaptation in either film or literature that is more creative or better written than Grimm's original. It seems this classic tale always gets messed up in a re-imagined version and the extra tangents and dismal themes drag the overall story down. The Snow White character here is dazed, pathetic and unrelatable. The Borgia part of the book added at least 2 stars to my review so if you're into historical fiction, these parts will pull you through."
2,"good start, bad finish","i read wicked and stepsister and fell in love with this author. i read lost, and got a disappointing wake up call -- i bought this one hoping for a return to form... the first half is full of wonderful descriptions and well formed characters. i loved it. i couldn't wait for the fairy tale to begin once all the subplots were in place: then it happened. the second half of this book. wow. it's almost like someone else wrote the last portion. i think i missed the point of the dwarves altogether, which is upsetting, because i genuinely wanted to like them. i did appreciate the mix of history with fairy magic; however, the narrative was right on the point of taking off when it simply didn't. i can still hope for a return to form, can't i?"
4,Easier to read than Wicked,"I read Wicked first, and I both loved and hated it. I loved the story, but I thought the conversations between the characters were awful, and it was dull to read. This one was better. I read it, and while I was reading it, I wasn't hating the writing. The characters are great, especially Lucretia Borgia, the evil queen we're used to. I also like the dwarves. I didn't care for Bianca de Nevada (Snow White). She never really developed as an individual. But on the whole, it's a good book."
1,Disappointing,"After racing to the store to pick up the new Maguire book, I was very disappointed in Mirror, Mirror. Have read all his books and seems like they are getting less and less interesting after Wicked. Wondering if Wicked will be Gregory's peak novel. Would not recommend this book, actually I took mine back for a refund."
5,Best book since Wicked,With this book Maguire returns to recreating an amazing world with an amazing history you can believe. I really thought it was his best book since Wicked
3,Interesting Take,"This was a pretty good read overall. I thought the development with the gooseboy was an interesting take, but for the most part it was rather slow reading. I thought the characters were all full and believable, albeit eccentric like most of Maguire's creations."
4,"Mirror, Mirror","I enjoyed the story, it was not as good as Wicked but still a fine tale and one worth reading."
3,Interesting Tale,"I love the story of Snow White, so I wanted to read this book.It was not what I expected realy, but it was a good read. I likedhow he named Snow White ""Bianca,"" blanca I think means white in spanish, so that was clever. He had an interesting ending with what happened to Bianca, that very much surprised me, but I don't want to give that part away.I do wish it had that fairy tale element to it, sometimes I forgot I was reading the story of Snow White. Some parts of the book dragged on and I had to skip them to get on with the story.I went back to those parts later and read them through.Except for the bad parts of the book, I liked it."
2,First impression of Gregory Maguire's works,"This is the first Gregory Maguire book I have read. I picked it up at the library because of the title and front cover illustration. The infusion of historical characters with a classic fairytale is very clever. But the dark, sometimes morbid thoughts and deeds of many of the characters leaves you wondering who this book is for. I wouldn't want anyone under 16 to read this book because of the content. It's dark and for only 200-odd pages, it's slow. There isn't enough history to make it a historical novel. And for fantasy lovers, there are tons of books out there that can keep you attention through 800 and more pages....Anyway, I'll probably not bother trying another Maguire novel."
3,What an Adult Fairy Tale Should Be,"Villains, heroines, mysteries, good vs evil, innocence vs guile. Maguire has taken the building bricks of our childhood tales to re-envision Snow White. And what a vision he creates! I appreciated the complexity of his characters, although...Snow...er...Bianca was probably the least formed. Innocence is just so, so boring. Now Lucretia, that is a character! Maguire delves deeply into her own mind, her motives, conjuring (if you'll forgive the word) a wry sympathy for the ""witch."" And the dwarves, morphing from mineral to animal to philosopher with each turn of the page. Perfect! I find it difficult to set aside a time to read. But I had no problems finding the time for ""Mirror Mirror."" It held me rapt until the last horrifying moments of one character's life and the ""happily ever after"" (maybe...) satisfactions of another's."
3,Mirror Mirror,It took about two weeks for the book to arrive. It came in almost new condition. A few of the pages were bent (like a page marker) but it came in very great condition. I would buy from this user again.
1,They didn't offer me a choice lower than one star.,"The books of Maguire were touted as ""reimagining of classic fairy tales."" Ummm. . .no. I was sorely disappointed to find that the books merely took loosely adapted generic characters from classic fairy tales, and then used them in stale, overbearingly boring political stories. I ordered Mirror, Mirror. . Wicked. . .Confessions. . .and Lost. . . and reading them was pure punishment. While well written for what they are, I suppose, they are not as described. They are not for people who love fantasy, nor are they for people who remeber the classic stories of youth with fondness. They are for people who feel the need to punish theirselves."
3,"Try to borrow this, rather than buy it!","This is the fourth Maguire novel I've read, and so far it's my least favorite. I agree with the other reviews which say that this is a little slow - the twists and turns are fairly interesting, but there doesn't seem to be much force driving the reader ahead.Maquire does seem to have done his research on the times, but since I know little about the Borgias, there aren't as many ""Ah ha!"" moments as there were with ""Wicked"" or ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister.""Mirror Mirror: A Novel"
1,"I'm bummed, this book was bad!",Ones taste in books is highly subjective. This one was bad in my opinion. I really wanted to like it. It was boring and the plot never came together. It feels like it was written by a completely author than Wicked and Confessions.The good thing is it is a quick read.
3,Not my favorite Maguire book,"I have read Wicked, Son of a Witch, Lost, and Mirror Mirror. I loved the other three (my favorite was Lost). I found that Mirror Mirror was very slow through the middle of the book. It picks up a little at the end, but I guess I've been spoiled by Maguire and expected miraculous books all the time. This one doesn't match the other three, but does have some interesting parts to it. However, I don't understand why the dwarves were stone-like creatures. Am I missing the symbolism (symbolism is not my forte)? Overall, I could have skipped this book. If this is your first Maguire book, please try another one. The rest are fantastic!"
2,Beyond slow!,"I absolutely loved ""Wicked"", thought ""Son of a Witch"" was fascinating, and enjoyed ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister"", but this book failed completely, and I often wondered if the author needed a vacation to get his creative juices flowing again. Well over 1/3 of the way in, I was still waiting for the story to begin. Slow is an understatement, especially in light of his other works, which truly captivated me."
3,Nice change,"It took awhile for this book to catch my interest. I am not sure I understood the ending, but was eager to find out how the story ended. My expectations were probably too high because I expected more out of the book. However, I have recommended this book to a friend. I liked the blending of historical fiction and a fairy tale. It was a nice change from other popular books."
3,Worth a read,This was my least favorite of the 3 fairy tale books by Maguire. It has a lot of imagination with the dwarves but was hard to follow at times. I liked WICKED the best.
3,Disappointing,"I've read ""Wicked"" and I'm 3/4 of the way through ""Confessions of an Ugly Step-Sister"" so I think that ""Mirror Mirror"" is simply an anomoly. The story didn't flow, the characters were flat, and the history was off enough to bother me. Honestly, I wish that I had skipped it."
3,Not the fairest one of all,"Maguire's fairy-tale-remaking machine seemed to be losing steam by the point he wrote ""Mirror Mirror."" In comparison to ""Wicked"" and ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister,"" ""Mirror"" is slower, less brilliant, and less coherent. Maguire's experimentation with the poem or spell that weaves throughout the novel is confusing. Also, though the selection of the Borgias as the historical connection was clever, their lecherous history lent the book a less savory flavor than any of the others. ""Wicked"" was miraculous; ""Confessions"" was amazing; ""Mirror"" is fair, I suppose."
2,Mediocrity at its best,"I am a big fan of Gregory Maguire's other books, but I found 'Mirror, Mirror' rather boring. Sadly, nothing really happens. The book does depict interesting historical character. They're fun to read about, but it felt as if the whole book was describing them in an effort to lead up to something big that never happened. The ending felt rushed, as if the book were supposed to go on for another 200 pages, but never really got there. This is definitely a yard sale/library read, don't waste the money."
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful","This may be the most successful of Maguire's several attempts to wander through old stories with a new vision. His most well-known is, of course, WICKED, but the plotting and development of this re-telling of the Sleeping Beauty is more intricate and sophisticated and the resolutions more interesting. What he does with the seven dwarf motif is beath-taking.There are books I read and give away. And then there are books I read and put on the shelf, because I know I will refer to them and will want to read them again."
4,loved it,"This is Maguire's verison of Snow White and it was very different indeed. It was so good, it was way different than Disney and Grimm's versions of the story. I don't want to give anything away, but all I can say that it is way different but still good, with a shocking ending."
5,Swimmers,My girls are swimmers and they love this show. They watch it all the time. I recommend this show to parents
5,Daughter loves it,My daughter enjoys watching this show. It is cute and age appropriate. I enjoy the convenience of watching it on my ipad.
4,Surprisingly good.,"We thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. The teen rating is earned as there is a lot of ""potty"" language. For the most part it is minor, but one instance goes a little too far when Marge refers to some dogs as her ""b!tches"". The game parodies are great, spoofing both contemporary and classic video games. The writing was good with several laugh-out-loud moments, many inside jokes for young and old and a memorable (if not controversial and thought-provoking) ending."
3,The Acrade game is still the best Simpsons game.,"The Simpsons game is trying to be two things at once, when in reality it be better has one of them. This game would be better off as a special or an episode than a game. Sure the story, voice acting, and humor are great, but that's qualities of a show, not a game. When you strip what makes this part of the Simpsons, you get something that's rather mediocre and bland. But the story is worth seeing, so see it anyway you can. But this game is really just for the fans, those that aren't dedicated should rent it or borrow from a friend at best."
3,"Good graphics, but very boring","Very slow pace game and at times is just plain boring. The visuals are nice, but that's about all the pro's to this game. It is better played with two people, since many puzzles need two characters to solve."
3,Great Game,"I'm only a few levels in, but it's really fun so far. The cut scenes between levels fel and sound like an actual episode, and the game play is pretty funny s well. The powers make perfect sense for the characters, and the more obscure Springfield residents get a line here and there too. Its not Halo 3 as far as gameplay, but hey, that's not why you buy this game."
4,Awesome!,"This game was the best Simpsons game I have ever played. I loved it, but some time the view sucked, and some places were nearly impossible to get to just like any other game. It ROCKED!"
2,Not entertaining...,"I love the show, this game.. not so much...It just doesn't have that addicting game play quality...It has the worst camera of any game i've ever played..I passed the game just to get it over with to tell you the truth..."
1,Attention: the system requirements!!,"I got this for a friends child who lives in Paris. He couldnt find it there, so he asked me if I could. Well, I did find it on amazon, got it and sent it to him only to find out (and I didnt know this before) that France uses PAL system while the US is NTSC system. I didnt know X-Box has such issues...PS-3 doesnt. So be careful when sending it overseas."
1,boring,not a big xbox fan it' my husband and this game was so stupid. let me sum it up for you- homer eats everything and beats up everyone and bart helps. waste of time. people go outside
1,The Simpson's Game - Review,"I received game but unfortunately, this cd didn't work. $6 Mistake. These can be costly if it happens repeatedly. This was one of my first purchases through Amazon. Live and learn, I guess."
3,I bought it for cheap so no big deal.,What can I say I'm a fan big of Matt's work since the Tracy Allman show. But the game itself is not to bad once you finnish all mission's there really is no point in collection the extras as it's super boring.
3,meh,"Well, it's a good game, but some parts are RIDICULOUSLY hard, for example, I smashed a controller in half because of Big Willy, I got the game from Play&Trade already on Big Willy, but I played all the previous levels anyway, so I knew how to play, but still I was clueless, again, it was EXTREMELY hard."
4,"exactly what you think, 2 player is more fun","this game definitely had a lot of creative involvement from the people who produce the show. the writing, animation, and game play is right on par with what you'd expect from the show. it isn't really that challenging, but it's almost more like a playable episode with typical video game objectives mixed up with simpsons humor.play this game with a friend in 2 player mode. it's a split screen, much more fun than 1 player."
1,Help,I wanted this game but i was wondering if someone could help me realize why this game costs so much??
3,Oops! Forgot this was under my husband's name! ...,"Oops! Forgot this was under my husband's name! I am Diane. I liked the product. I have never used anything made specifically for incontinence before, but always used sanitary pads. Honestly, I can't say there is a lot of difference so I would probably base my choice between the Poise and the menstrual pads on price. They did seem a little thicker so I think that they might be a good idea for someone with a more severe problem. I have more problems when I am pregnant or sick where I sneeze or cough a lot. Fortunately for me I did not have a lot of problems during the test drive!!! I would buy them if the price was right."
2,Find another game.,"This game had it's bright points. The story is fun and it's a good time blowing stuff up.But that's about where the fun stops.The game is incredibly buggy. It freezes on a fairly regular basis, or allows your character to get stuck in situations that require a reboot of the system.And the game play has some serious flaws. The single most annoying element a game can have is rampant in Merc 2. Often, when you die, you respawn on the other side of the world map and have to spend the next 5 to 7 minutes walking or driving back to the mission where you died. That drives me insane. I understand that you can't go undefeated in the game, but at least respawn somewhere near the death point!"
2,Not a $60 Game,"EA apparently released this game before it was finished. The graphics really are last-gen and the games has bugs that interfere with completing missions. Remember how in the first game you could capture certain well-guarded characters, detain and helicopter them out? I was doing one where I couldn't knock the guy down to detain him. I struck him from every direction and he didn't fall. The only thing that worked was shooting him. I've encountered similar problems in other parts of the game. They also seem to have designed this game to attract GTA fans -- there are missions that involve driving a car to a given destination within a certain time. Such missions were not part of the first version of this game and that was fine with me. I liked its straightforward approach. You can have some fun with this game but for what you get, this should have been priced $20-30 less than it was."
4,Great seller,"The guy who sold this to me called me about the problem I as having and helped me. I quickly deleted my original rating and now I am writing this one about the product. Very impressed about the satisfaction part of the seller, and the game is also a blast to play."
3,fun cheat game,this is just a game id play with cheats and have fun with. i played the story but it was difficult to have to do some of the missions.
5,Just like the title world in flames,"Its like mercenaries 1 but polished...More explosions, you can destroy practicaly everithing, lots of vehicles.So if you are a fan of mercs 1 or you are a fan of big explosions this game is worth every penny..."
1,not worth it,"It does not all you to zoom shoot characters. Cross between ""need for speed"" and a scavanger hunt. Not worth the money if you are the type that likes Call to Duty."
1,Piece of junk,"I couldn't tell you anything about the game since it freeze's every time I load the game. Yeah sure there's an easy fix, log into the EA server using a different game by EA. Well thats great if you have other EA first person shooting games."
1,Does NOT work,"The game would have been awesome, too bad it does not work on new Xbox 360's. Bought one for myself and one for my friend, Cd loads then gets stuck in the intro screen when connecting to live. What fun is this game if youre not playing with buddies? Bought 2 originally from gamestop, did not load. Bought 2 from here, again, did not load, friends also did not load, 4 cds, 2 xboxs, none worked. Way to drop the ball EA and give up on a game after launch.also tried all the fixes, flush the game cache, etc. NO DICE."
3,Mercs 2,"Overall its not a bad game really. The graphics look a bit date, and the destruction system is subpar when compared to what we've seen in Battlefield: Bad Company, but for some good 'ol fashioned fun with blowing things up, you're not going to find a better choice than Mercenaries 2."
3,dose not work online,we bought this game and thought it could be played online. It can not. the EA server for this game is shut down along with a number of other games. It is fun but we bought it for online playm
5,Very worth the money,This game is like Grand Theft Auto on Steroids. Merc's 2 is by far one of the best games I have ever played. There is so much to do and the graphics are awesome. This game is well worth a 10 out of 10.
3,Rating service only as game was gift.,"Service lived up to my expectations and product arrived in good shape on time. This game was gift for grandson who lives in a nearby town, so I have no feedback regarding the game itself. The rating system forces values for the games, so I rated them in the middle."
4,Like GTA w/ more explosions,The gameplay and story may not be as polished as GTA but then again you get to blow up many more things in this game. Looks pretty darn good as well.
2,Reunion,This is the little novel that could and should be on the best seller list. It left me with feelings of wonderment and hoping that things could turn out like that. When I put the book down after reading it I couldn't help the smile that came over my face. Could that really happen.......?
3,Decent,"Overall this is a good notebook, but there are nagging problems with it in my opinion. One, the ackward placement of the microphone/speaker input. It is located on the front of the notebook and when either a microphone or speakers are plugged in to it, it can get in the way when typing . The standard notebook speakers are very mono sounding. If you happen not to like Windows XP, don't plan on using either Windows ME or 98 SE, Toshiba doesn't make finding drivers easy. This computer can also get hot and slow down or even freeze if it gets to hot. It is a bit on the heavy side too. Battery life is also short. I have also found the standard cd burning software that is included, Drag N Drop, to be ackward as well. In the overall picture, these problems are minor. If you are just looking for a good entry level notebook, this one is fine. Just be aware of the little quirks."
4,Mathematical Methods book,"Very good book. Wide range of contents and written in British style, which may seem strange to some."
1,There are much better options.,"This book is only good for someone who is very experienced in these areas of mathematics it discusses. It is not whatsoever for a student who wants to learn these things for the first time. It should be avoided at all costs to someone who does not already know how to do these mathematical operations. If you want to learn techniques of math for science, read Mary Boas's book (excellent) or Glen Fletcher.If you are looking for an in depth analysis of these subjects after a course in mathematical methods and comfort in mathematics of physics undergraduate, then this book is comprehensive and good reference book. I still, however, find the book very lacking and regret buying it overall."
3,Dark Side of the Writing,"I thought I could get through it, after all it's a classic. Once again, found out, not my style. If your mind retains what you read...pass this classic up...whew"
1,"23,000 pages & no table of contents","Good luck finding anything in this ebook. Unless you read the entire thing chronologically, you will essentially be wasting what little money you plunk down on this. Find another version. This is the third literary collection I've purchased that has this problem. Amazon really needs to get their act together on this!"
3,Typos Galore,"I love Poe's writing, but I have two problems with this particular omnibus. First of all this is not Poe's complete works as the title says. If the title says complete works, then it should contain the complete works. Secondly, and most important, this book is rife with typos and formatting errors which drive me nuts. If you are a fan of Poe's work, I would recommend that you look for another compilation of his work."
1,The downside of Amazon,"If you want a book of poetry, go to a bookstore. If you want a text only ""green version"" with no table of contents, no formatting, and a pixelated low-resolution blown up picture on the cover, then pay for this piece of garbage, or save yourself the time and money and just print it out yourself."
3,A Passing Poe,I should have guessed by the price that the book was not a large volume. I was looking for a full cross-range of work by the author. This book is nice as a basic book on Poe but I needed a heavy duty tomb.
1,Doesn't Work,All I can do is get a headline that says novels. It would nice if I could more than one word for the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe.
1,Kindle Edition Leaves Out Whole Sections,"I was excited to be able to get the complete works of Poe for just .89 cents - unfortunately you get what you pay for. Several of the short stories are missing whole paragraphs. How did the Lady Mary die in Metzengerstein? You don't know - because the paragraphs aren't there. Horribly disappointing, especially since I bought this edition for school."
1,Horrible Kindle Edition,"Save your 89 cents (or whatever this costs, now). The ""Kindle edition"" (obviously imported from some other eReader format), is unusable. Short stories are named ""Chapter 1"", ""Chapter 2"", etc. in the table of contents, so it's impossible to find a particular work. Worse, the navigation links are clearly broken, jumping from place to place for no apparent reason. This version is a complete waste of a download."
3,Someone's Ugly Daughter,"I may be the only person in the world besides C. Dane's parents(the lead singer) that bought this cd, but it is pretty good. The best songs are Love is a Scam, Surrender (which is a Cheap Trick cover) and the best song is Malibu. If you find this cd somewhere you should get it just for these few songs."
3,A lover's triangle,"Two women, one man and lots of drama! This was an ok read. It took us on a roller coaster ride for sure!"
5,Deadly Betrayal,"Deadly Betrayal is a must read book! Once you start reading, you will find it a challenge to put this book down. Everytime you think you know how the story will end, it takes a twist. It is a wonderful, exciting book. I look forward to reading more books by Paula Toney-Brooks. I highly recommend adding Deadly Betrayal to your list of books to read."
2,"Raw power, unfettered by technique.","Some authors can interpret and perform their own work, take John Le Carre for instance, his pacing and phrasing let the story emerge on its own merits. Harlan Ellison writes challenging material and then allows no room for interpretation with his uncompromising oral style. Maybe the raw, breathy technique adds something for some people so I won't mark it down to 1 star. For me I like it best when the recording company puts in the effort to find the right voice for the story and with very few exceptions that job falls to professional performance artists."
1,No beginning,"Great stories...too bad you start at 5% in, no title page, no table of contents...and missing the beginning of ""I Have No Mouth."" Will be looking for another version to download and glad that this one only cost me a buck."
1,Utterly Disappointed there is no Kindle version...,"I have just stumbled upon this book that I have forgotten to read from years ago.Now however, I see that almost all other Harlan Ellison books already have a Kindle Edition, BUT NOT THIS BOOK!"
5,Genius,His best are among humanity's greatest.He is largely unappreciated.The titular story should leave you in tears.This anthology is mid Ellison.
4,"Great stories, nice package","The overall look of the book is not going to wow you with production and design (very plain looking), but inside you are going to find some of Harlan Ellison's stories that are my favorites. Creepy, disturbing and mostly devoid of hope. Gave me chills with several of the stories."
4,"Well Written, Exciting, Unexpected","Like many other people, my impression of Harlan Ellison is colored poorly from a personal encounter. But this is a review of the material, and irrespective his personal conduct, the man can flat-out write a story. He's good - no doubt about it.This collection has his most famous stories and they ought to be familiar because they've been retold and homaged and performed often enough to be mainstays of fiction. I have no complaints about the stories, no complaints at all. The only reason I gave this less than five stars is that I wanted more background from the collection - more insight into how the story's materialized and what makes the fiction writer tick. Other collections of suberb work do better in the 'fluff' or background material.I recommend it to all.CV Rick"
4,Great Read,"A wonderful book, it arrived early then I thought which was a wonderful surprise and was in perfect, new shape.A wonderful addition to any Ellison collection."
3,Ellison strikes again,"This one starts off with a bang; ""I Have No Mouth"" is easily one of Ellison's all-time classics. While the rest of the collection is all quite enjoyable, none of them are as memorable."
3,"Good start, but thennnnn...","This collection has more bad than good. The title story has one of the more eerie concepts I've ever read, and it's carried out fairly well, but the rest are throw-aways. I always wonder if Harlan knows where he's going with these stories when he starts them."
4,Good Old School science fiction,"Very descriptive, near the point of exhaustion. Sometimes chunky combination of poetry and longer prose. Good stories, long enough to get you into a new world and closes in a way that does not leave you wanting."
3,Synjase - 'Return To The Vortex' (Whirlybird Records) 3 1/2 stars,"Synjase is a project by musician Jake Bell, as he had at least two solo titles on this label, which was Silver Apple's home in the late '90's. Good electronic music to thoroughly take in here. Tunes I liked best were the dream pop-ish ""Wavething"", the futuristic / ambient ""Raytader"" (maybe the disc's best cut) and the nine-minute adventurous ""Song For The Return Of My Future Self"". Line-up: Jake Bell-guitar & synthesizer, Patrick Jordan-keyboards, Peter Killawee-percussion & drum programming, Gary Higgins-drums and Todd Merrell-composer & programmer. Give this one a shot."
2,Awful,The slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy. Unintelligible at time....Not what the books are about.
5,Rebus Redux,"If you're a fan of Ian Rankin's novels of Rebus the detective, set in Scotland, you should enjoy this series. While the actor who plays Rebus seems younger and better-looking than how I imagined the character, he definitely brings you around to seeing him as Rebus.The scenes are gritty and seems realistic. There is some violence but it's not overdone. And yes, your ears have to adjust to the accents, but it's worth the trouble.The plots are complex but seem to stay true to the book they are based on. It does help to have read the book first but you can still enjoy this series even if you haven't.I love to watch these while I'm on the treadmill--it makes the time go faster."
1,Hannah-Rebus,The REBUS DVD's were short of one of the three discs.....chapters 1 and 2 were missing. I was taken... The seller knew one disc short.... Very disappointed in this purchase... I will not buy used DVD's in future
4,Enjoyable. An Excellent Adaptation Of The Popular Novels.,"Rebus the DVD is a fairly accurate adaptation of Ian Rankin's story and will only disappoint those looking for perfection in the minutiae of the story and John Hannah's portrayal of the slightly off, but intrepid character, DI John Rebus. For even though John Hannah's performance is absolutely splendid, it is the Rebus of the adaptation, and not an exact copy of the character as drawn by Ian Rankin's pen.In truth, I'm a reader and fan of the novels and it didn't bother me at all. Any bit of license the show's creators took was more than compensated for by keeping the production entirely in the city of Edinburgh, which as every reader knows, is the real antagonist in the Rankin DI Rebus stories.As a fan of crime fiction televison exported to the US from the UK, I was delighted to find this unknown to me Scottish police mini-series and quite satisfied with the purchase after viewing."
3,Fine if you're Scots,"RebusOk but not great. Bit hard to follow the Scots accents, and the DVD doesn't include subtitles."
2,Not for Rankin Fans,"Here are the similarities between Ian Rankin's John Rebus and the character as portrayed by John Hannah:1) They're both Scotsmen.2) ...Well actually there are no more similarities.Don't get me wrong, Hannah's a terrific actor, I've always enjoyed him, but he's simply not the John Rebus I've come to know through Rankin's superb crime series. He's not tough enough, angry enough, drunk enough, sad enough and -- perhaps most importantly -- certainly not funny enough. None of Rankin's dry, stinging wit is anywhere in evidence here. And I have to agree with the prior reviewer who said that the stories move way too fast, cramming too much plot into too little time. At least they got Cafferty right, he's pretty much as I imagined him. (Although just think what Brian Cox could do with the role!) I'm off to check out the later Rebus series. At least from the packaging that actor looks more the part."
3,too realistic,"I can't really tell if I like this or not because the Scottish accent is so real that I can't understand most of it. Usually I'm good with most varieties of English except Deep South US, but this has me beat."
3,Look like a professional con artist.,"Harry Anderson is one of my favorite magicians. His style and presentation are outstanding. It's a shame that this is the only book he's written. This book starts out showing you some fabulous cons you can pull on people. The first 92 pages teach you exactly what the book says. Unfortunately, the last 70 pages are about ""Games you can't win"" and tell you all about casinos and carny scams. It's a shame that the book starts out so good, then fizzles like it does. It's still worth the money and will make you look quite sly around your friends."
5,A good history book.,I bought this after my neighbor showed me this book. I like history and It was a good price. I enjoy this old book.
5,Awesome,"This translation of Journey to the West is awesome. I'll admit that I haven't read other translations, but, from people that I know that have read the Chinese version, and also seen the Chinese series, and I have discussed the book with them, they say it is a great translation of the book."
1,glitch ride,"My gosh, how can a company justify selling glitch-ridden software? I have a plain vanilla windows XP system, and this program jerks & sputters (sound static) and after playing it I'm feeling nauseus. The 3d tables swing around as you play, so you can't focus, and the 2d tables scroll so fast you can't make out the details. Play is nothing like a real pinball table.My Advice? Try Fantastic Journey instead."
5,Good stuff,Does the job. I bought it to extend my printer cable; I strung two smaller parallel cables together to make a longer cable. Worked fine.
4,Great Tool but expensive.,Used one of these years ago and thought I might buy. But at the price I hesitated for a long time.Great product but too much $.
5,Is a great gift,"My husband loves this . He has sharpened it up and thinks its wonderful for a number of things, takes it with him everywhere especially hiking to move brush so he can get through the woods. He took our CHristmas tree out and stripped it within minutes. def a great gift."
3,Ok for what it is.,"Honestly, there's nothing really wrong with this book, it just seems a little on the thin side. It's like the Cliff Notes version of Jack Morin's book (which I highly recommend). Oh, I suppose I should explain: I bought this for my wife so that she might get more comfortable with anal sex. After I bought this, I bought Morin's book, and that's when the real fun began. What started out as an attempt to get my wife into anal sex turned out to be grand experiment for me. Now, analingus and two-way anal sex is a regular part of our marital relations. Let's be honest here: dildos and strap-ons can be for straight men too."
2,Yea Right!,I thought this would be helpful but instead the writer gives an air of superiority to those of us who may not be into this as much as she is. It did provide some basic information but not anything that I had not already found on the website.I did not like this book at all.
3,Not for the meek; targeted at those intrigued by anal,"This is a good book. I learned a few things, and so did my girlfriend, but it's targeted at someone who is already curious about, and interested in participating in, anal sex. If you are hesitant about anal, haven't tried it, or are appeasing a boyfriend by reading it, then it's probably not going to do much for you. The author starts out, right off the bat, expressing how much she loves anal. She always loved anal, since she can remember, and she never had a problem getting into it. If you're having a problem getting into it then this book might make you feel ashamed, or uncomfortable, about the fact that you are hesitant to give/receive anal."
4,I love it but you really can't improve on perfection.,"I really loved the new album but I felt some of the songs were not as good as the originals. They seem to have lost a bit of the power and passion that just used to flow from their music. Having said this, I believe the songs are wonderful, especially ""Sacrifice"", ""Ooh Baby"" and "" That's Why God Made The Moon"". The cd is worth the cost for those songs alone. It's a must have for any The Jets fan."
5,very helpful,my boyfriend and i watched this and it was extremely helpful. I have fibro so he gives me massages a lot and this dvd was very informative
4,"Indepth, but to indepth","My wife suffers from Fibromyalgia, hence the purchase of this DVD.Its VERY VERY descriptive in how to perform massage. In fact its for massage therapists. Now not being a massage therapist its still a very well put together DVD. If you have knowledge of the body and or locations of the pain your are getting then this is perfect DVD. I highly recommend thi. I have tried it on my wife and she has noticed a relief in pain and stress"
2,Yawn,"Don't waste your money, get a massage instead. I was told I had fibromyalgia which would never go away but that's bull. See a myotherapist and read books on trigger point therapy self help. Treat yourself if you can."
4,11yr. Older Review,"The I-Speck~I-Guy is very cute. I just got it today. My I-Pod is being fixed, but I put my sister's nano in it and it seemed to fit fine. BUT, the flap in the back makes it a little unsturdy. One in a while when you stand it up, it will fall over. Also, It does collect & stick to specks and hair like crazy! So don't drop it on your carpet everyday. But overall this cute little i-pod holder seems to be a FOUR STAR!~S"
3,Fun and useful,"This product is cute, fun, to play with and protects my ipod.I love it.It is very expensive so i recomend not getting it online-the shipping was outragous"
2,Amateurish and hardly traditional,"This artist on this CD is not to be confused with Ali Akbar Khan. Somehow I confused it and ordered the CD. Although Akbar Khan has adequated knowledge of ragas, he does not seem to be able to capture the depth of ragas like Todi and Darbari. I cannot call his playing traditional if what we mean by traditional is something based on a classical understanding of melodic form."
3,Not a bad choice.,Raga Des is the best. On the whole all are good to listen to. I would recommend this more for beginners. The incorrect spellings of the names on the Cd is very irritating!
5,Don't Pet a Pooch While He's Pooping,This true gem is hilarious and precious at the same time! All of my dog lovin' friends dig the funny quips and frilly little illustrations. This was truly written by a person who thinks dogs are just as essential to life as I do.
5,I loved this book!,This book is creative and funny! I put it in my guest bath and I have received rave reviews! It is a great gift and it is worth the $8 in smiles!
1,potty training paper,I first saw an advertisement for this book in Dog Fancy magazine. The cute title and cover picture made me think it would be a humerous read. I WAS WRONG! This book consists of a few sayings that are suppose to be funny but aren't. It's a good idea but it's written with little creativity. You can read this whole book in ten minutes and i bet it was written in that amount of time too!! All this book is really good for is training paper!!!
1,not suitable for space engineer,"Just one more ""Einstein was wrong"" paper sponsored by the ""Natural Philosophy Alliance"" a club of dogmatic anti-science conservatives (similar to ID but applied to physics).This version innovates as it also claims that ""Newton was wrong"".Yet the Nasa has routinely shown the contrary.Only recommended for the NPA members."
2,Lovely half of a book,"This oddly articulate yet daft woman does a great job of tearing Einstein and science education apart, then offers nothing of substance as an alternative. She thinks rotation causes gravity. It doesn't. Save your money, and look for the answers in plasma effects or the graviton."
4,Highly agreeable,"""Agreeable"" is the word the author's son uses to describe the book in the foreword, and it does well. Enfield is amusing, insightful, sympathetic -- a pleasure to be around. He seems to be without the least hint of shyness or self-consciousness, and equally without the least hint of brashness, a combination that Americans find almost impossible to achieve. This is an account of two bicycle trips through Greece, taken in his mid or late 60s, and both are described in loving detail. He meets all sorts of people and condescends to none of them, and even tosses in some rather moving history. The book is mostly a travelogue with some elements of guide book intermixed."
2,rough going,"The author is obviously an expert in this field, but his book is very difficult to wade through, even for someone well-versed in finance. I had the same issue with the ""Body of Knowledge"" books. If all you do for a living is valuation, you might appreciate these tombs, but for practical use, one I like more is ""Unlocking the Value of Your Business""."
4,New information for the new economy,A great addition to your reference library. The Handbook is an incredibly useful tool for valuation of the new companies and industries that have emerged in recent years. I highly recommend it.
4,cheaper at Academy Sports,"It can be purchased for less at academy sports. It has a lot of pieces but can be assembled in one night provided you are competant at keeping track of the pieces...the tools and pieces for assemble need a little nudging with a rubber mallet hammer at some points. once assembled it provides the workouts that it should...seems like a good deal for 200, but not at the 450 plus 150 in shipping...decent product but look around for cheaper places to purchase it"
5,I love it.,I received this watch as a gift. I love it. I tried on a lot of watches before deciding on this one. The band is comfortable. The band is not stiff; it will lay flat when off your wrist.
1,Bad Cream!,This cream left a black ring around my mouth where I was bleaching. I've never seen a bleaching cream do this... I wouldn't recommend to anyone.Hope this ring disappears soon!
2,"Sad,sad,sad","A great songwriter and performer, on this album however you'll hear an artists who lost his sense direction. A few good songs: the title song; Tender is the night. All are arranged loosely, the band sounding like 6 incidently playing at the same time instead of a coherent group of musicians we've heard on JB's other albums. Worst in his carreer."
4,jackson browne has fun.,"on this record jackson browne makes an attempt to be a bit funny and loose. he is successful and for some reason people just don't get it. no, this is'nt ""late for the sky"" but it is worth buying."
2,Doesn't cut it,"I've listened to Jackson Browne since his first album. This one is now in the yard sale pile, I just don't think it was a good time for him, or that's how it seems to me, it's a little flat and not one would I play after a really long stressful day at work. Obviously there is a couple of good songs but, not enough for me to keep this one in my collection."
3,Almost completely forgotten 80's JB,"Wow, this one almost gets forgotten about. He never plays anything from ""Lawyers in Love"" in concert. Maybe it's because the album is oh so dated sounding. Despite that, the title track is downright classic JB. Whatever political commmentary you take from it, it is quite a catchy tune with brilliant vocals. ""On the Day"" and ""Cut it Away"" are decent tracks also. ""Tender Is The Night"" had some good airplay, and occasionally gets some concert play. But the rest of LIL has that very forgettable tinny eighties sounds that most of us want to forget. The absence of David Lindley really makes this one a 'need not own' JB album. Fans often try and discount it's predecessor ""Hold Out"" as well, but in truth, it is much more cohesive album than LIL - and it does not sound at all dated.This one is for hard core fans only. Strangely the album came out not long after his career peaked. Listen and enjoy... some of it."
5,RICK VITO PLAYS LEAD HERE,Had this cd long many years ago. Read all the other reviews. Somehow no one mentioned or credited Rick Vito. He contributed great lead guitar to most songs here. His guitar tone is heavenly and his techniques that of great rock master. Tuneful songs from Browne garnished with Vito's sharp tearing guitar works. Sadly only 1 album of them together. Just in case you don't know Rick Vito is one Fleetwood Mac.
1,ehat is this,It sounds like a bunch of guys just honking there horns. lol. Im sorry its a free country you can honk ur horn but I thought I bought music. If you want to hear some real music check out Lady Gaga.
2,Please jazz fans forgive me....I was wrong,"Yes I have on my night table ""kind of blue"" and ""Giant steps"" and ""Chet""..... yes I am a ""jazz nut"".. but inspite of having listened at least 20 times to this CD, I just can't ""get it""... I am giving it 2 stars as there is NO doubt of its historical value.. but I can't say that I really enjoy listening to this album.....I will try again in a few years........ Again this is only my opinion so maybe I am ( and probably am) wrong!!!April 2007; 2 years later I realize now that this is a fantastic album. I just needed to train my ears!5 stars!!!!!!!!"
2,Illustrations too scary,I started to read this to my son and he immediately didn't like it. I asked him why and he said the pictures were too scary. Not good considering I bought this book so he wouldn't be afraid to go to bed.
5,Sonny Clark: He The Man,"Another excellent Sonny Clark Bluenote, not as tight perhaps as Cool Struttin' or as rhapsodic as Leapin' and Lopin', but a loose, swinging air of conviviality pervades throughout. Things are enlivened by the presence of John Coltrane, as well as Curtis Fuller on trombone. Though Fuller also appeared on Dial ""S"" For Sonny, his playing sounds better here, perhaps because the interplay with Coltrane is a cut above. With all the room that the soloists are given to stretch out, things still never become dull or pro forma (as they sometimes can in these 'blowing sessions'). Clark's sinewy lines and lucid sense of swing never fail to satisfy. One wonders if the folks who program the Bluenote ""Connoisseur"" series will next reissue the Sonny Clark Trio album, with all the alternate takes at the end. Hope so."
3,Unsettled Memories,"I read Nine-Headed Dragon River maybe 17 years ago. At the time I had no Zen experience, in fact I had almost no familiarity with Zen at all. But I'd loved every other Matthiessen book I'd read, and there were at least half a dozen of them. After scanning the reviews here, I'm tempted to return and reread it. In my initial encounter, however, the book seemed incomprehensible and uncontrolled. It felt random, scattered, almost as if pages and paragraphs had been torn at random from notebooks and assembled using some incomprhensible John Cage algorithm. Even today, recalling the unsettling and disturbing feelings it generated, I remember fearing that perhaps PM had lost his grip. Nine-Headed Dragon River is certainly not for everybody."
4,great buy,"I read a lot of reviews and I kept coming back to this model of toshiba. A tech person at our school district recommended this brand to me over dell, hp. I am very pleased with my new purchase! The fan does get a little noisy at times, but I haven't taken it to a classroom yet to see if it matters. At home, I don't care. I am very pleased with the speed too. It is a bit heavy compared to some others out there but I don't mind. The 15"" screen is great! I highly recommend everybody to look at all the reviews you can find to get all of the information you need before you buy. The amazon reviews were the best resource for me."
2,Long schmong,"I was compelled to buy this machine by all the reviews saying that it had a long battery life. First off, it only is long if you let it sit there and do nothing! I got 2hrs, 15 minutes just running a DVD. I got 2.5 hrs. running normal programs. The only nice thing about this laptop is the colors. It matched the mouse! I cannot even find a backup battery except from Toshiba for ... Well beyond the current prices. I would not waste my money on this computer again."
2,Toshiba Satellite 1905-S301 LCD Screen is terrible,This laptap is very fast and I can't say anything bad about it except the quality of the LCD display is terrible. The colors are very washed out. You can play with all of the brightness settings and color settings but it does not correct the problem. On some software or web pages you cannot tell when the background is highlighted in grey because of the washout problem. It is very similar to the very old not active LCD displays from years ago. Appartenly Toshiba is using this terrible display on most of their laptops. This model is not cheap yet the display is terrible. Check it out at a store before you buy. I am a long corporate Toshiba customer and am now looking to other manufactures. ...
3,Damaged,It is a very nice set but one of the sides was loose on the stand that holds the coasters. It seemed like too much trouble to return it.
2,Soliah,"In the beginning, you think what's the big deal let the woman go back to her new life. At the end, you think, let her rot in prison. It does give you the whole story if you can get over the mountains of insignificant details!"
1,"button, button, who's got the button?","Velcro is fine until the diaper gets heavy, then it fails to hold them up - is there any hope of getting the extra-absorbent with the button straps? Help!"
5,I'm pleased to let you know that the ...,"I'm pleased to let you know that the Depend Undergarments, Extra Absorbency worked great. No leakage at all. My daughter, who is 14, went all night and the bedclothes stayed dry. I really liked the Velcro tabs for holding them on, and the fact that they're reusable and can be hand washed. These are a lot better than any other product I've tried and I'll recommend them to friends."
3,"ok case, but is low cost",We wanted a case for a Motorola V170 which is a small phone. The case does not fit as well as other cases fit other phones. However for the cost it is ok; it will protect the phone.
4,nice,"i had just finished udolpho when i picked this one up. i really liked this book, it was a very masculine Gothic. it had some problems though. for instance, a maiden's value hinges on her virginity, this came up several times and the book was always in firm support of virginity regardless of the way it was taken or the person who took it. the story itself was fast paced and easy to read. i would encourage people to read it."
3,"Of historical significance only,","Unlike, for example, Beckford's ""Vathek"" and Radcliffe's ""The Italian,"" ""The Monk"" is a classic gothic novel that has only historical interest. When he wrote it, Lewis set out to go beyond anything his predecessors and competitors had done in terms of shocking the reader. In that respect, he definitely succeeded -- his book was notorious for over 100 years, and even by today's standards it's an eyebrow-raiser. Illicit sex, torture, rape, murder, satanism (with one real-live demon, no less) are all here, described in ""loving"" detail.All this sounds more titillating that it really is. Lewis's style is completely conventional, the characters are two-dimensional, and long stretches are quite dull. ""The Monk"" is worth reading if you have a real interest in classic gothic literature, but otherwise it may be safely by-passed."
3,Not as advertised,The picture that was shown and the one I thought I was buying had a handle on the opera glasses. The ones I received did not. Because of the time constraints I was not able to return them.
1,Run from this phone!,"This phone is absolutely useless! User menus are not user friendly and it lacks many of the features that you would expect from even a basic phone. Its cumbersome to use, unpredictable (spontaneously drops calls, switches off, etc). Verizon were completely unhelpful and unsympathetic - I'm switching all my employees phones to another carrier as soon as my contract is up."
1,jay-z fell off with this one.....,"What is Jay-z thinkin??? He has a masterpiece with Reasonable Doubt and Vol. 1 is by far his 2nd best album. Thats whats wrong with rappers these days, before they hit it big they come with that raw heat (some of them not all of them) and jay-z is no exception to that. So when he hit the big time he abandoned the thought of keeping that raw energy he brought to the table. This album seems as if he just slapped toghether some material without putting any thought in to it whatsoever. It's sad that the american public who listen to jay-z think this is his first album. So if you are reading this and you are a ""True"" Jay-z fan then you need to go get the ""Reasonable Doubt"" and ""Vol. 1 "" albums then you will understand why I wrote this review.PEACE"

3,It Was OK,"This album wasn't the best rap album. I can think of some others. Jay-Z's fourth album, Vol. 3...The Life And Times Of S. Carter was better. All of DMX's albums are better. But I still liked it. There are some really tight lyrics and beats on this album. I favorite son is Can I Get A..., which features Ja Rule and Amil. It is a good album but some of the beats and rhyming sucked. An OK album from a great rapper."
1,sucks,"this cd sucks, i wouldn't suggest this album to jay-z himself, this is a bunch of crap, don't buy it."
1,Vol. 2 Hard Knock Sympathy,"awww it must be such a hard knock life.doing nothing and recording trash talkand gettin millions and a nice caron the CD cover.what a hard knock life!Crappa what, Crappa who?"
5,Jay-Z is one of the greatest.....,"Every song on this CD is tight. Especially Hard Knock Life, Can I get a...., One week ago, and Money cash hoes. Get this CD. Now. Go buy it."
3,"Jigga, whut, Jigga, who?","Jigga's latest release is half bad-half good. Dumb ""just wanna move ya feet"" tracks like ""Money Ain't A Thang"", ""Can I Get A..."",""Hard Knock Life"" ( with that stupid Annie chorus, and ""Paper Chase, just to name a few, really hold Jigga back. But 4 hot tracks, ""Money, Cash, Hoes"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""It's Alright"", and the best song, ""Nigga What, Nigga Who"", a banging track featuring some of Jigga's best lyrics and a strong back-up from Bigg Jazz. Those four tracks, plus three other decent tracks make this album worth the money, almost. Memphis Bleek, Jigga's protege, outshines Jiggahimself on every lyric he spits. I would get Jay-Z's ""Reasonable Doubt"" debut album than this if ya don't have it."
2,I Have Heard Better CD'S This One Aint Sh*$,DMX IS A HELLA OF A LOT BETTER YA'LL NEDD TO BOUNCE AND GET THE DMX CD JAY-Z BLOWS
5,JERMAINE DUPRI AND JAY-Z MAKE THE PERFECT MIX,"I THINK MONEY AINT A THING IS THE BEST SONG FROM JAY-Z,OR JERMAINE DUPRI EVER. I GIVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE THE SONG IS SO TIGHT. I LIKE THE VIDEO ITS PRETTY TIGHT BUT I ALSO LIKE /CAN I GET A....BUT MONEY AINT A THING IS BETTER. JUST REMEMBER MONEY AINT A THING."
4,This is Jay-Z's best cd ever.,I especially love Can I Getta... It is off the hook. I have never like a song this much before.
5,THE HOTTEST JOINT TO COME OUT IN '98.,"All the tracks on this joint are hot. Jigga is the best lyricist out right now. He shows that he is versitile on wax. I just wanna can he freestyle. And I ain't talking reciting what he does on his albums but just straight-freestyling. M.C.'s better look out. That joint that he did with Kid Capri is too hot. Everybody needs to do something with Timberland also. That cat got the best beats. All you other cats just beware of this lethal combination. If Jigga, DMX, and Ja Rule come out with that ""rumored"" joint, Timberland has got to make an apperance. If you don't have this C.D. I highly suggest that you cop."
2,lyrics are vulgar album for a small niche,"The album has some good beats, but I probably would have liked the edited version better. Just can't play this album, which is otherwise decent, in front of most people. Unless most peole you know are into vulgarity. The theme from Annie is a good hook. Best song on the cd! I'll try the edited version, maybe you should too."
1,this cat doesn't have 9 lives,he is the flavor of the moment and that's all.his flow is boring and all the music is basically the same.not to mention that foxy brown is his protege.but i agree with the reviewer that said he is a poor mans b.i.g.that's still a big compliment to an overrated person like him.and now duets with marriah carrey?
1,one of the worst cd's I ever heard.,"This cd is totally wack, what in the world is jay-z rappin about in this cd, can i get a.. Is one of the most bunk songs I heard in my life, don't waste your money on this cd, if you thinkin 'bout buying some real rap how 'bout you buy an N.W.A, 2pac or spice 1 cd. This doesn't even classify as rap, just jay-z talkin alot of s---. so don't waste your money on this cd."
4,Average Jigga,"This is Jiggas average album. It is okay but with Jigga, its 4 stars. There are hits like ""Hard Knock Life"", Ni*ga What Ni*ga Who"", ""Can I get a.."" the album is good but the rest is pretty bad. Download those songs"
2,RE:Not even close to the previous albums,"First things first. The beats on the album are wacker than the previous albums. Beats by Swizz, Timbaland, and Erick Sermon on this album failed miserably. Should of stick to Big Jaz, Ski, and one of Puffy's hitman. Secondly, the lyrics are totally wack. At least the first two albums were diverse but this album is all about cristal and fantasies. He is fooling the youth and believes this nonsense he spitting is an evolution of hip hop. Put it like this the album failed."
3,Hard life,"Many people will diagree with me, but out of all the albums Jay has done this album is the hardest for me to listen to. Because he has to many people on this album. Jay does not need a person breathing on a album with him more or less having other people on the album. Yes, I know he was introducing Beans and others on this album. The Best Song is Hard Knock Life, and that's because he is on the record by himself. I have never liked this album as much as the rest because of all the people on the album. However, numbers do not lie, and many platinum sales later who care what I think, and opinions are like butt's everyone has one. But in my humble opinion the best parts of this album is whenever Jay spits other than that I skip the rest."
1,Jay-Z the king of pop music,Jay-Z is a terrible excuse for a rap artist. His music is horrible and more commercial then all the boy bands. Jay-Z should go back to his days of wearing a bullet-proof vest.
4,Jay-Z proves his genius!,"'98 was the year of Jay-Z, not only did he have the years biggest single, he had the years biggest album. Hard Knock was not a disappointment. Though I admit it was commercial, I loved every single song. Jay had the rap game on lock in '98"
5,Hard Knock Life changed Hip Hop in 1998...,"1998 was the year of the Hard Knock Life by Jay-Z. I mean {dang}, wasn't that title track stuck in your dome all the time. This album was classic. Yeah ...I heard people say it's commercial but listen to the lyrics. Jay-Z was very sharp throughout this CD. The guest apperances included The Lox, Ja Rule, Bleek, Too Short and DMX who also held rap down during this era."
5,this album is the best I have heard in hip-hop yet.,"This album touch on every aspect of surviving in the ghetto. It made you look back on the days of maturing, things you had to deal with and even laugh at it so it wouldn't bring you down. This album also showed how much of a lyrical genius Jay-Z is. He doesn't rap, he school's you on life and what he went through and how he endured. Only other ""rapper"" on Jiggah's level is Biggie, No Doubt! I was really feeling this and I listen to it every day. I hope he keeps dropping tracks and I can't wait to hear what's next from Rocafella!!"
1,JIGGA IS Triflin,I HATE hatin the man but from his 1st album cant knock the hustle he sounds muthaf&***gin tiflin sampled a TV show for MONEY AND HARD KNOCK what has hip hop come to now?
2,"Not bad, but not great!","The CD wasn't too bad, its just that it wasn't my kind of rap. A little bit more work on the non-hit songs would have made this album even better."
4,This Third album is betta than the second,"Nothing was better than Reasonable Doubts, but I must admit Hard-Knock Life is a good album, although I couldn't feel ""In my lifetime"". Trust me this is not a waste of money."
4,Great cd...4.5 stars!!!,"I bought it today. This is one of the best albums Jay ever released...it's a banger from beggining to end, great production, a lotta quotables throughout the cd and Jay sound very confident in every line he spits!!!"
1,Jay-Z should get -5 stars,"Jay-Z is the worst. I would say he's ghetto, but that would be a compliment to him. Just to say, listen to some real rap, like EVERLAST!"
1,1 word---WACK,"Jay-Z is the most over-rated rapper ever. He ain't hard and needs to quit tryin' to be. His beats are average, he can't flow, and he just sounds like sh*t. Sure, songs like Can I Get A are aiight to bump and dance to when you're in a club or whateva, but this album really ain't all that and y'all gotta get off dis fools di*k. Go out and by yourself some 2pac, the greatest rapper ever or some REAL gangsta rap like some Geto Boys or Dayton Family or Brotha Lynch Hung. Plain out, Jay-z's album is wack. West up!!"
3,Boring as sh*t.,"This album has great production. It's one of the best sounding albums of 1998. The only bad thing is that it is incredibly boring to listen to Jay-Z's half asleep flow. There are also too many guest stars and way too much hype on this album. It's not as good as everyon is saying it is. Vol. 2 is really easy to get sick of. I bought the album as soon as it came out and yet I haven't listened to it in months. Worth borrowing from a friend, but not worth buying."
1,This is the weakest CD I've ever heard.,What a waste of time and money this project was. How the hell do you take the theme from Annie and use that as the chorus to a rap song. Jay-Z should be pimp slaped for makin people listen to that stupid $h%t.
2,"A good album, but made me mad","I did kind of enjoy this album, but there are way to many bad things about it. First of all, being from NY i had heard of about 5 songs that were supposed to be on this album that werent. As a matter of fact there were only 12 new songs, with It's Alright and Money Ain't a Thing as so-called ""bonuses"". Plus on almost every track there were guest stars, which takes away from the actual artist."
1,What the hell was this fool thinkin,"Alright all these other people liked it, don't trust em'. Why did this fool track the song from ANNIE. Aint no ghetto anthem. Jay-Z makes cool music most of the time. That ""hard knock life"" song killed this CD. Why did this fool put out such worthless $h%t. Put it down fo' da -C- side, stay up.........."
3,good enough to buy,jay z is still working his way to the top one song at a time but there are only a couple of hit or gonna be hits on this cd
1,Punk...,"Anybody that samples music from the play Annie should be kicked out of the rap game, how many unoriginal songs do artists gotta pump out just to get play on MTV...In addition to that he gots no skillz on the mic...."
4,YOU'VE GOTTA GET THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I don't really like Rap but this was the bomb!! He already has six tracks off of this album on the radio. SIX!!!!!!!!!!! He is all that.
5,NYC...JAY Z THE HOTTEST SHYT OUT!,Aight lemme just say JAY Z is the hottest nigga out there! Many hip hop artists know what they tryin to say but cant quite say it and make it hit ya like WHUT! like JAY Z can. His lyrics say exactly what i wanna hear in the exact way im feelin it. JAY Z is sweet! AINT NUTTIN TO IT! HE KNOW THO!......*smiles* word i hope he see this if not yall juss sit tite! ROCK A FELLA YALL!......aha! P.S. NIGGA WHAT--NIGGA WHO......IF YOU DONT KNOW YOU OBVIOUSLY ON THE WRONG PAGE!
5,Off the Scale,"I simply cannot get enough of this CD. Every time I listen to it, I fall for a different track. The beats, lyrics and flow are off the hook. Didn't think he could get any better after the first 2, but he showed us otherwise.I don't know of anybody that can take his crown.---------Gard-Dogg"
4,Its lyrical content and phat beats make it great listening,its canny good but sometimes its only alright and it swears a lo
2,this album is weak,"I liked ""Reasonable doubt"" and ""the blueprint"" but this is a weak album. The best track on the album is the first Priemier track and jay doesen't even rap on it! The only other dope track is ""Resevoir Dogs"". The rest of the album is just to jiggy"
4,"Hes Pretentious, Ill Give Him That","I feel really bad that Jay Z has had such a hard life, really I do. I mean, it can't be easy being a rich successful rapper, never having to worry about looking for a job, never having to work for a living, He claims that all he does is rap and have..., surly that's a Hard Knock Life. I'm always surprised that these rapper complain about how hard they have it while simultaneously bragging about all the chicks and cash they have, isn't there a contradiction here? Not to hip hop fans, I guess. Also, if the guy really is a crook, let's stick him in jail; let him put his money where his mouth is. All of this has happened before, and it will all happen again. Nothing wrong with Jay Z's game, I suppose, but nothing really new here."
3,Just Ok,"I'm a big Jay-z fan, and have appreciated his music since his debut, however I think that his records have constantly gone downhill from the first album, as commercialism dilutes both the contents and the beats- he loses much of the potency of his street sound and the credibility of his lyrics. This album had a good many tracks you can dance too- enough for those mtv fans, but it's lyrics were nothing like the first album's- they didn't possess the same kind of nimbleness, sharp wit, and impressive mental dexterity, also there were too many half-baked guest appearances. All the same the album was not bad- could have been a lot better.I wasn't too impressed.Another point to make though- in reading some of the customer reviews I noticed a few tacitly racist responses. If you can't appreciate the culture and think it is ""ape-like"" (one individual actually called it that), why did you buy the cd? Aren't so smart are you, stupid? Stick to your harmonious heavy metal!"
2,"Sexist, simple-minded album that gets stuck in your head.","I will be honest, I listened to Hard Knock because my kid brother owns it. The songs are extremely catchy (Money, Cash Hoes just sticks in my head.) but that's about it. The subject matter is moronic gangster hedonism which is not only detremental to the hip-hop nation, it is also outdated. Jay-Z is just danceable, MTV-packaged NWA gangster garbage, a poor man's Biggie Smalls.I give Jay-Z credit for one thing. Unlike RZA's abhorent monstrosity, Bobby Digital, his songs are actually memorable. Is that because they follow the Puffy Daddy pop formula of simplicity? Obviously, but they're catchy, danceable dribble which will be forgotten by the time my kid brother graduates from high school. Sorry, Jigga, you won't last."
2,A Disappointment,"Hov,what were you thinking when you released this?Not even better than vol.3 or The Dynasty.If you want the real Jay-Z,then Reasonable Doubt,Blueprint,and In My Lifetime are thealbums to get.Don't buy this,folks."
1,Junk.,"YO WUD UP HOMIES?!!ME LIKE DIS AWBUM!IT DOPE!DIS JAY-Z IS DA BOMB!I DOWN WIT DIS AWBUM!HOO!HOO!HOO!HOO!HOO!HOO!HOO!HOO!HOO!HOO!HOO!Just kidding.It's disturbing that someone as ostensibly stupid as Jay-z(Check out these trite lyrics)can sell a geegol of albums.So he's an upstart?Big deal.Name one of these Hip-Hop cretins that isn't.Half the songs on the album deal with subject-matter that only serves to belittle him.The other half is just a bunch of vulgar,sexist,confusing songs that no Rap opus would be complete without.So,essentially Hip-Hop hasn't made any drastic changes over the last 8 or 9 years,something that cannot be said of music that involves human instruments.It's sad that something this banal and consequently worthless is selling."
3,it's just so-so!!!!,"this alubm make Jay-Z become a Super Rap Star but It's NOT a good album I think!I'm a HARDCORE JAY-Z fans,but this one really ain't that good....I'm surprised why so many people OVERRATE it!actually It's not that bad when I got it from record store,but it quickly getting old!now when I wanna listen to Jay, I won't choose this one always.but it still have some nice songs:Hard Knock LifeN---a what N---a whoMoney Cash HoeCan I Get A...Money Ain't a thangalthough not the best by Jay, but still better than many trash rapper and their trash album!don't recommend if you're not Jay-Z hardcore fans!just for Real Jay-Z fans who want to collect his albums!"
1,"jay-z..after 1classic album in rd, 3 straight garbage albums","jay sells out, and his rhyming is just not good anymore...theres a couple good songs, but not enough to justify buying this...i suggest you get reasonable doubt or the blueprint, much better albums without wack beats, and especially much sharper lyrics. if you enjoy bs like 50 cent, you might enjoy this wack garbage, but if youre a real hip-hop head youll steer clear, straight into reasonable doubt. a disgrace for a talented mc."
1,Jay-Z 2nd straight wack album,"Most overrated rapper of all time!This album is wack!All the beats are simple and the lyrics are boring.All he raps about is money,cash,hoes,cars,and how tough or great he is.That Hard knock life song was garbage!Joe camel gets worst and worst as time goes on.Save your money and don't by this garbage!"
2,very disappointing,"If you are buying this album to hear ""Hard Knock Life"" and ""Can I Get A..."". Then buy the album, but all of the songs are very similar and not all that good."
5,DA BOMB,Livin' in D-Town..grew up lovin' Jay-Z!! Money..Cash..Hoes...Was tha CUT! He just layed it down for all the Haters...and the lovers! Lettin'em all know that he is coming up! much love for all my DALLAS homies!
1,I CAN'T STAND THIS GUY!,"He is an embarassement. I hate him so much I didn't even want to give it a review. I don't know what people are thinking, saying he is the Micheal Jordan of rap? You should start listening to some Wu-Tang or Drag-On, some real rappers. The only good song is Money Cash Hoes because of the beats(I like this song not because I like DMX. X is WACKER than Jay-Z). East Coast rap is just so good. So why do you have listen to him when you can get some other rapper with better flows, lyrics, and beats?"
2,Can You Say Sell Out,"As you already know, this is the album Jay-Z officially sold out on. If you don't believe me, listen to ""Moment Of Clarity"" from The Black Album where he admits in so many words that he sold out for the money. He changed his style and flow (for the worst) dramatically and it resulted in his most successful album at the time. Just like everyone back in 1998, Jay-Z decided to go with everyone else in the Timberland and Swizz Beats movement."
2,Bit the sell out apple,"This album is basically trash. Jay-Z changed his format. From a fast rhyming MC doing cameos on Original Flavor and Big Daddy Kane, to versatility in his previous albums, to just living the fantasy life in this album. The hip hop fans may boo me for this but it's freedom of speech so I'm not hating. It is basically fact that he bit the sell out apple. Only four tracks are hot and three of them are featuring Memphis Bleek. This album went from bad to worse. To all your Jigga fans: I don't follow trends. I listen to what's appealing to my ears. In my personal opinion, I do not listen to cristal popping, and drug pushing because I don't live it. If hip hop is about lying to the fans, play with their emotions about being a playa or drug pusher and actually do not live that lifestyle, then I must quit listening to the artform called hip hop."
5,you gotta get it,"I like Jay-z he is cool and he can get a what what from the critics and people and all.He is a very talented rapper.I have this c.d. and it is pretty good.I accidently got it at wal-mart,so it is edited.I want to get it explicit but i never get the time.Jay-z should have really featured Mase or Puff Daddy instead of like Memphis Bleek Jarule and that girl from Major Coins."
3,Yaddy Yaddy Yah,"I have to admit, Jay Z's flow is purely a gift, but can someone please tell me why the popular rappers today all use the same ""Chrissy Snow"" type subjects? I mean does all of america need to hear the same brain dead topics? Who REALLY cares if the only thing you know about life is ""Tales of Drug dealing and murder in Marcy"" It's sooo lame!! Black men are so much smarter than that. All of these cats need to know that boasting about being a drug dealer does not make you great, it only makes you an IGNORANT nigga!!And these overly commercial beats ( with the exeption of Premiere) only WEAKENS the Quality of this already TOO weak CD! Bottom line: Very Boring and predictable"

2,dissapointment after classic releases,this album isint bad for an average rapper but for jayz this was a crossover album lost street cred this was an album that WAS FULL OF GUEST APPEARENCES!!!!! and only had 14 tracks and one was just a throw in jermaine dupris money aint a thing jayz has skills on this barely lp but after classic releases and guest spots all over this is a terrible jayz album5.5 of 10 lyrics 6.5 of 10 beats
5,great,"This album was great. Every song could have been a single. I still love ""It's A Hard Knock Life"" Who doesn't know that song from Annie! Jay Z coulda been corny singing it, but it was a HIT! great job Hova!"
5,Classic -- movies of this simplicity and style are hard to find,"Classic -- movies of this simplicity and style are hard to findI watched this movie, my children have watched these movies, and now I am purchasing for my grandson. I remember our children watching the original Benji over and over, never tiring of the special way Benji visited the townspeople."
3,Great celtic sounds,"Enjoyed many of the sounds on this older CD that I haven't heard in their orginal format.Especially Doug McLlean and Mary Black's ""Both Sides the Tweed""."
2,Lightweight,"Pretty lightweight melodic rock in the vein of Styx/Survivor. I found this in a bargain-bin, it sounded promising but I've heard this type of music countless times by other bands. The band is good, the vocals are fine, the digital recording is very clean, but it didn't grab me. Full lyrics/credits, 11 tracks/47.01."
5,A wild romp through the old West.,"When Logan, a half-breed, finds his way to Rosalie's doorstep carrying his dying mother in his arms, she can hardly refuse, and she's drawn to him even then. Later, when he arrives at her door bloody and beaten by a Adam Cahill's henchmen, she cares for him. Logan was resigned to living alone, his indian blood made him a target, but Rosalie found her way into his heart, and was determined to stay by his side, no matter what the townspeople said. With unwavering courage and a group of loyal friends, Rosalie and Logan would face the challenge of their lives when he's accused of attacking Adam Cahill's beautiful, deceitful stepdaughter, Della. I really enjoyed this book more than the following stories Wayward Wind and Wind of Promise. The author showed how people can come together in the face of prejudice and injustice. I especially liked the fiesty Minnie, one of the supporting characters."
5,Garlock shines on Amazon,"Another excellent novel by Dorothy Garlock! This time it takes place in the Colorado Rockies at a time when the land was first being settled by families moving onto the land and turning it into ranches or farms. I was glad that the story did not end with ""Restless Wind"". I am now ready to begin the last book in the trilogy, excited to see the finish to this surprising family."
5,Restless Wind-Dorothy Garlock,"I love Dorothy Garlock Books. There are several writers that I keep all their books and read them over and over. I do not have all of hers, but I am working on it. You will not be disappointed in buying Dorothy Garlock books!"
1,Don't buy this book!,This book is the worst test prep. It actually has errors in the test that are unacceptable. It caused much confusion to have errors in the test which threw me off. Don't buy this book and save yourself the money.
4,simpsons ranking,"This game is funny, easy to play, but it doesn't offer a very hard level of playability"
2,High expectations..,"This book just shows you how to actually install some of the known superchargers, nothing more, nothing less. Instructions you expect to see in the installation manual that comes with your supercharger. I was expecting more like what supercharger to pick for specific applications, tuning a supercharged vehicle, intercooler selection, proper compression ratios, ignition & fuel systems... nothing of that! You can benifit more from magazines & internet sites."
3,Nice Short Workouts,"The workouts are good beginner workouts...I think they are really short though. If you are more advanced and at an intermediate level I wouldn't buy these videos unless you want just a short workout for days you really don't feel like working out. However, they do give you some good and new exercies..the slim and sleek video is probably my favorite though."
1,Bad instructions!,"Compared to other workout videos these just fail. There is poor direction given through out the workout making it difficult to concentrate on the moves because you always have to be watching the screen to see what, when and how the next move to be. Also, personally I need a workout that is going to get me up not put me to sleep. These are just not worth the time or money for me."
4,La Iglesia enel mundo Contemporaneo,Este texto es una de las mejores historias sobre la iglesia desde la reforma escritas hasta ahora.
1,Not a Classroom in a book. More like a presentation.,"This book is not about creating PDF documents from scratch. It is about converting an already existing document into a PDF file. It focuses on converting Microsoft Office files (Windows) to PDF, converting Microsoft Office files (MAC) to PDF, converting other files to PDF, converting paper forms to PDF, etc. It also focuses on how to combine multiple forms into a single document.It presents simple views for addressing tasks and does not go into much detail. It shows one way of doing things and does not cover any exceptions or problems a user might encounter.The three pages in the book on capturing data and handling it after is primitive and not useful instruction.It does not show how to create a document from scratch. The chapter on using the Designer is only 50 pages and is also a high level view."
4,Acrobat 8 Classroom In Book Great review,"Being that I haven't upgraded my own instruction on Acrobat since version 6, I found the Adobe Acrobat 8 Classroom In A Book a great review of a great application. Yet another great textbook from the long line of support from Adobe."
3,"Good book, but not at all if you prepare for the exam",The book was overall a good book with all what you need to know about Adobe Acrobat. I am preparing for the exam and the book does not cover 75% of the test. Unfortunately Adobe did not think of this and decided to make it very hard for us. Microsoft on the other hand has many books that cover the topics for their exams. Wish Adobe would learn that one thing from them....
4,From the back cover,"Consenting adults.Simon Townsend's cool rejection of Jenna's teenage adoration had left her smarting, and determined to get her own back one day. Then, at long last, the time came for her to wreak her swift and effective revenge...She didn't realize that her little scheme was playing right into Simon's hands. He had told himself that Jenna was too young for love all those years ago. But he had decided to be patient. And now he was going to teach her that grown-up games were dangerous, and they were played for keeps!"
5,Book,"Ormond Aebi's little book provides a look into this man's reverence and love for bees, and is a must read for anyone who views bees more as friendly back yard pets than purely industrious insects."
5,Must read for BEEKs and nonBEEKs.,"I read this book the Winter before starting my first colonies of bees, after finding it on a dusty shelf in a rural library. I would have enjoyed reading this book, even if I hated bees. The author writes in a style all his own, and tells the story as if you were a close friend. The ups and downs of his lifetime experience of keeping, and being kept by bees. I'm glad to see it avaliable in greater numbers and will be buying a copy for my own collection."
1,This is not DVD Audio,"The sound on this disk is at best average compared to other 5.1 recordings. The most important thing to note is that the disk is mis-labled. It is NOT DVD-Audio. It is DVD-Video.I bought this disk to test out my new DVD-Audio setup. The disk is not recognized as DVD-Audio. I checked on my PC and it does not contain DVD-Audio data files. ... And the ""label tape"" (the plastic tape that is used to seal the top of CD and DVD cases) does have the DVD-Video/DVD-Audio icon on it. If you really want a DVD-Audio disk, don't be fooled."
1,Read before you buy,The sound on this disc is dissapointing compared to the 3 other DVD audios I have. It is shrill and really no different than a standard CD. The volume levels vary from track to track and actually fades away at times - including the end of the Hallelujah Chorus. Only a few selections are included and there are no notes at all. No text and no info on the soloists or conductor. I doubt I will listen to this disc very much.
2,"Spectacular Work, Mediocre Presentation","As an owner of several video and DVD presentations of Handel's Messiah, I have found this particular one to be the most mediocre. While the music itself is acceptable, though not outstanding, the graphics are often totally unrelated to anything to do with Messiah, and a couple of scenes, in my opinion, are inappropriate. In addition, I find it many times more enjoyable to see the people who are singing, playing, conducting. So far, the best Messiah presentation I've seen is Holy Land Arts, ""Messiah in Bethlehem,"" which would get five stars from me."
2,Handel's Messiah London Symphony Highlights,Handel - Messiah / London Symphony (DVD Audio)As stated by others not a DVD audio - It is a DVD in Dolby Digital & DTS surround. OK if thats what you want but not a high resolution DVD audio disc
2,"revolting, but hardly monstrous","Though ""Serial Killer"" jumps out from the title, the author never came close to becoming one, so it seems that the title is to lure in unsuspecting readers. The sexually deviant content is told in sickingly detail, and I have to admit I couldn't read all 600 pages of it."
1,sick and self-absorbed,a waste of time. waste of publishing money. i kept thinking it would get somewhere. it never did.
2,SO small!,"I bought this to hold my 2 year old's shoes and it barely does that! Medium size bins, HA! Read the size before ordering and know that it is small!"
3,"Picture shows two, fine print says your only buying one",My fault for not paying closer attention to the fine print. Would have been nice to have seen something in larger print indicating a single tray.
3,incomplete,"I have ordered several of these bins, but they never send the stems for stacking them; what gives?"
2,They DON'T Stack!,"These are a great idea, and very economical. I bought 4 of them, and they DON'T STACK! when they're empty, they do nest nicely. But no matter how I try, they are each a little bit off from each other so that they do NOT stack...I'll get one side lined up, and that makes the other side off so it sinks in.In other words, buy these if you don't need them to stack. I've filled them with what I bought them for, so they sit on top of the contents of each bin rather than stack nicely on top of each other. What a rip off, eh? I only gave them 2 stars in stead of 1 because of the ability to do that. Luckly, the items I am keeping in them aren't breakable!"
2,Works -- once or twice,"As others have written, it IS difficult to put together -- even for two people (and I, too, have put together dozens of different tents, shelters, etc.). Also as noted by other reviews, it tears easily when exposed to the elements for even a day. Finally, during our first use, one (all plastic) corner bracket partially broke; during our SECOND -- and apparently LAST -- use, TWO MORE corner brackets broke completely. Spending even twice as much for a more robust, better designed unit will probably result in ten times as much satisfaction...and use."
4,Easy to put up,I am a women and I can put this together by myself in less then 10 minutes. We love it for BBQ's in our yard. And it was so inwxpensive.We have had it for 4 years now.
2,Rocket Science,"The little stickers on each pole which identifies which other pole it goes with don't stick on. Therefore, you are stuck with oddly matched poles with no direction of where they go. My opinion is to invest in a canopy other than a &quot;Greatland&quot; product."
1,received damaged,"I can't really say how the canopy sets up or how good it is because when I received mine it came in a damaged box with parts missing. I purchased it to use it for a graduation party, but I sent it back for a refund because it was no good to me and I didn't have time to order another one."
4,Decent product,"This product is exactly what it claims to be. It's very functional and not very decorative. It's seems a little cheap looking, but does a great job for the price. I have no complaints."
2,Too Little for the Money,"I bought this machete for my husband at his request. He tried it and thought for the seventy odd dollars it was definitely not worth it. The blade was too short and not strong enough. He asked me to send it back, which I did."
1,Not what I ordered. AVOID BuyDBest as a vendor!,"BUYER BEWARE! The product shipped to me was not at all what is depicted and described here on Amazon.com. The shape of the blade is the same, but that is where the similarity ends. No lanyard, no case, and an unwieldy finger guard which I did not want. This is useless to me, and not at all worth the 79 bucks I paid for it. If you buy this from Amazon, make sure it is not fulfilled by one of their lousy vendors. In my case the vendor was ""BuyDBest"", which should have warned me they are not on the up and up... Now I have to package it up and return it to get a refund. I will not try ordering this from Amazon again. Maybe there is somewhere else that sells the product and will ship me what I actually ordered."
2,Sad,"I bought this as a 40th birthday present for myself. Sadly, it came with a less than impressive custom engrave job and a very dull blade. I was so excited when I ordered it and so disappointed when it arrived. I want to buy from a USA company again. Please make your product excellent."
4,heavy duty,"I am happy with the Woodsman Pal. It cuts through small sapling and branches easily and the tang runs through the handle completely unlike other brands. My one concern is with regard to the rivets that hold the wood handle in place. With extreme use on hard dead wood, I have loosened up the rivets. With a hammer I was able to tighten them again, but they have indeed become slightly loose again after additional extreme use on some very hard dead wood.For clearing thick wild raspberry vines and opening up trails and lanes, this tool is hard to beat however."
5,It's a Woodsman's Best Friend,"I used Woodsman's Pals over 40 years ago, and they still work just as well for clearing small brush and trees. Got this one for my son, and he says he'll use it.I got one as a present myself, and carry it in my pickup truck for contingencies. It's formidable, and bad guys will be impressed."
4,Juliette Low,It was nice to find this book that covers the founding of the Girl Scout movement. It's easy to read and quite interesting. Would recommend it to anyone interested in Juliette Low.
2,Not what I thought...,I thought this CD would be a good thing for me and my husband. We are 70 years old and want our mobility to be better. The program goes too fast and doing work on the floor is hard for us. Would like something better for seniors.
3,Bad on the knees,This dvd is VERY hard on the knees. so many exercises that have way too much bending of the knees to be therepeutic. the one part that I did like was the part where you warmed up all of your joints. that part might be good as a daily warmup. the rest - no - way too advanced for my body.
4,Great stretch and range of motion dvd,"This routine takes you through every joint in your little body and helps you improve your range of motion. Great chance to use all God has given you and keep it going strong and long! The dvd was made a long time ago, but no matter. I am glad I have it."
1,Stretch of Joint Mobility,"I think the content of the DVD is great - HOWEVER, it stopped working in my player after 6 or 7 plays.Other DVDs I own work just fine in the DVD Player. I HATE that it stopped working!"
3,"Too ""talky""",I actually like working out to this DVD. I appreciate the moves and the fact they address the entire body.I gave it 3 stars mostly because I wish you could easily skip over the 'tutorial' portion and just start the routines. Once you have heard the explanation of what joint mobility refers to...you really don't need to hear it again.
1,Mind-numbingly uninspired,"Those who thought the two Blaze albums would have been better if Bruce had sung on them should listen to this album. The same problems that have plagued every Maiden album since 1995- needlessly slow intros, repetitive choruses, and overlong song structures- are on full display here. The only two songs that stick out in any way are Out of the Shadows, which is actually quite nice (though very similar to Bruce's solo song The Tears of the Dragon), and Lord of Light, which is practically the only song on the album with any sense of energy. Most of the rest of the songs are plodding, sleep-inducing ""prog metal"" wanna-be tracks that sound like outtakes from the previous two albums. For hardcore fans or completists only."
3,Un disco muy lineal,"No es un mal trabajo despues de todo. Lo reprochable es lo repetitivo del disco. A veces te da la impresion de que es una sola cancion con espacios en blanco como descanso. Esta bien que tengan intros lentas en una o dos canciones, pero, ¿en casi todas?. Me parece que deberian hacer un disco mas variado la proxima vez."
1,Disappointing,"I LOVE Iron Maiden. I own everyone of their albums, I think they're great and everything. But I'm very disappointed with this album. I ""tried"" liking it, but Mmmmm sorry, they must be under pressure from the record company to put out the album."
3,"Great album, but way too somber and mellow","I have to only give this album 3 stars because although the musicality of it is great, the riffs, bass, three guitar ""blast"" and everything else you expect from maiden is all great but the entire album is so mellow and you just cant get into it like you can the old maiden. For the hardcore fan/collector, go ahead and buy it, but for the casual listener, Id stick with the first 7 albums."
3,A Matter of Maiden,"It's okay but they have yet to top Killers. Brave New World is still the best they've released in recent years. Clive Burr, get well soon. He was the best drummer the band ever had. Nicko's good too, it's just that Clive had a feel that really defined him."
5,Metal for the mature listener,"In my 35+ years of listening to and loving music, I have grown up with the best of the best. Sabbath, Zeppelin, Purple, and later Priest, Scorpions, Tull, Rush, Queen, U2, Tool, and Iron Maiden. I judge music by how it affects me emotionally. If i can feel the passion of the artists for their music, feel an adrenaline surge, feel a powerful connection to the music, then I'll keep coming back for more. Thus is the case with Maidens ""A Matter Of Life And Death"". The power and the passion are there in spades!!! Thanks guys"
3,NOT ONE OF THE BEST....,"WOW! This album shows a much more progressive metal sound than the previous 2 good albuns BRAVE NEW WORLD and DANCE OF DEATH...The first song is a MAIDEN classic, DIFFERENT WORLD...really good! But the rest of the album is not so inspired...Seriously, all you hear here has already been recorded by MAIDEN, with little differences...The previous 2 MAIDEN albuns are really good, but this one is not one of the best..."
4,good album,"I recommend this album. Quite a few time, and tempo changes throughout. 4/4 with tempo change between chorus and pre-chorus, 6/8 middle part w/ solo, and 15/8! on the Longest day. 7/8 main riff on Brighter than One Thousand suns. Lots of ideas input by the entire band makes this one shine. This is an interesting, solid album!"
1,Maiden Died During Dance Of Death And Is Now Rotting In The Grave,"It was with much amusement that I read Nicko McBrain describe the new music as ""underground, progressive"" (how everyone loves throwing that word around) and believe it or not ""cutting edge."" Think of the opposite of those words and there you have A matter of life and death. There is a forcedness about everything they do now, no real passion and while they drop a handful of new ideas in places, it still is quite dismal. I'm sorry to say this about a band I like but they should try harder or pack it in."
3,"Very respectable, except...","The songwriting and lyrics on this album are mature and interesting, and Bruce, Steve, Jan, Dave, and Adrian perform well. My only complaint is with the drumming. For one, Nico's timing is off in many places. He plays fills and intros too fast, and tends to speed up while he's playing. And another thing, the snare drum sounds TERRIBLE. I don't know if the snares were too loose or what the problem is, but the snare sounds very fake, as if a combined snare/high-hat hit was artificially put in by the producer. This, combined with Nico's timing problems, sometimes make some of the songs unlistenable. Otherwise this album would get four stars."
3,Ehh,"I'll buy a Maiden album 'cause it's Maiden, but this one really left me wondering. Not one track stands out to me. I think we're all expecting another Brave New World, but have been let down. I'll give tracks 3 and 10 a spin a few times, but the rest sounds exactly the same as Dance of Death."
1,BOOOOOORING!!!!!!!,Why does this album have such good ratings??? Because all the bad reviews get deleted or don't show up at all! I wrote a review a few days ago! It never showed up! ONLY the 5 star reviews show up! I'll be surprised if this one shows up at all!This album is very dull with no variety! I can't even listen to it & I'm a huge Maiden fan! Bruce sings every song the same lately. BOOOORING!!!!!!
2,Why?,"Why does this album get 5 stars from many reviewrs?...cos maiden could fart on an album and these stefords would claim it's the best album of all time. These songs are just like brave new world and dance of death, long and boring tunes with no feel or soul. Why does every song have to be over 7 minute with boring intros?....Stick with eightes maiden!"
3,Haven't heard the whole thing....,"All I know is that the song, ""The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg"" really sucks. If you're looking for the sound of classic Maiden then if you're like me, you'll stick to the ""Best of the Beast""......."
5,They still got it!,I can't believe after all these years Iron Maiden could still come up with such amazing songs! This only proves that no matter how old you get or how famous you are and even if you're rich..if these guys love to create real music they can still be doing it for another 26 years!This album is so great!
3,Decent,"Better than the last, I can hear Bruce's voice going. Maiden hasn't been too good since Powerslave. I suggest listening to newer bands like Majur Bludd and not 50 year olds rehashing the same riffs they did better 20 years ago."
2,Not there best work!,"First off the reviews thus far appear to be fake because there a bit too polished honestly. As a long time Maiden fan I purchased this CD over the weekend to listen on my long drive to my girlfriends house. I was very disappointed. Maiden have taken a more rough approach this time around. I guess ""Alternative"" would be the best way of describing the sound here. More of a Nirvana meets Maiden would be accurate.The days of ""Seventh Son or Stranger .. Land"" are sadly long gone."
1,A.M.O.L.A.D. SUCKS!!!!,To me it's even worse than D.O.D!!!Bring back the glory days of the eighties!!!!
5,A honest and good album,"This album is STRONG. Not their best, but definitely the best among the newer albums (beats dance of death, brave new world, etc. by far). I can see how others rate it as their best album ever. It is definitely VERY VERY strong. Compositions are very unique and refined. Lyrics are inspiring and refreshing. The musicianship is top notch. In fact, I would say that in terms of production and musicianship, this album is probably their best release ever. There is too much to be said about the songs. Check out, just for fun, lord of light, it will give you a good idea of the playing field level of this album. Some of Dickinson's best work ever - and his voice also comes out really nice in the mix. I can honestly say that this is one of the few Maiden albums that I can listen to all the songs without skipping any. I can't say that for very many of even the older albums."
3,"Decent Album, Lame Concert","Like most of the people interested in this CD, I'm an old maiden fan. The CD is pretty good, in that many songs show that Maiden still has some creative ability. I saw the associated tour, and I think they played the entire CD. I really wanted to hear at least some old stuff. I felt like I paid $60 and drove 50 miles just to hear 'Hallowed be thy name.' I don't understand why bands treat their fans like that."
5,This cd f**kin rocks!!!!!!!,"im not really a kid, im just to lazy to make an account :-) anyway i have been looking forward to this album for a long time now. having been impressed with both dance of death and brave new world i couldnt wait to get my hands on this. after one listen it became my favorite since bruce came back to the band with B.N.W. the album is solid from start to finish which i might add is a very long time lol. the entire band sounds great and bruce's vocals have never sounded better. i read that they chose not to master this album to give it a little bit of a rough sound and with this album being a little on the heavy side ( at least for maiden ) it was a good move. whether u were a fan of the lastest from maiden (B.N.W. D.O.D) or not, this album should be right up your alley. i think its better than both to be honest. the guys in maiden show no signs of slowing down and they continue to put out great albums. pick this one up!"
4,Strong Modern Maiden!,"Oh, how this album makes me sad! Not because it's bad, of course, but because it's some of the best songwriting that Iron Maiden have done...ever! But as their songwriting and cohesiveness as a group have increased, so too have Bruce Dickinson's vocal abilities decreased. This should come as no surprise. The great Maiden frontman has aged considerably since first appearing on 1982's The Number of the Beast. And, of course, you have to applaud his willingness to go out there and give it his all. But, sadly, there's some rust on those pipes, and he can't quite pull off this stellar material like he used to.Don't get me wrong! This album is still very strong. It's also one of their darker and more cerebral offerings and certainly worth owning (I do!). I just wish it had been written fifteen years ago."
5,maiden at their finest!!!!,"brighter than a thousand suns and benjamin breeg could be the only songs on the album and it would still be 5 stars,their best to date,incredible,awesome,etc...buy it or you are missing out."
5,Their best yet,A lot of purists might disagree but I personally think this is Maiden's best album yet. Well worth buying.
3,What is really going on?,"Ehh, seems like one big long song all joined up. I got this in 2006 when it came out, ripping it to MP3 now and this just like Dance Of Death all sounds for the most part like one song or at least one formula that has gotten stale. I thought Brave New World was impressive, but something needed to change up following that one to keep it fresh. I don't think Dance did enough and neither did A Matter Of Life And Death. Let's get back to some more manageable song lengths maybe and get those songs to at least sound way more different from each other than they have been in recent times. Can we keep it to just one epic 7+ minute song next time? Drop the needle almost anywhere on this platter and it takes a while to figure out what songs is playing you may be playing something off of Dance of Death... hahahahah. 3 stars."
4,Better than dod,"After listening to this album about 20 times i can now write a review. This is not one of those albums that stick to your mind imidiatelly after the fist listening. It takes time to carefully analyse this album. As a metal fan of long experience I can say this album isd much better than their previous release Dance of Death. I wouldn't say its better than "" Brave new world"" (which i think was an exellent album), but its preatty damn close. So if you absolutely hate ""brave new world"" than dont buy this album. Other wise this is probably the best metal relese this year.Now, i am not going to analyse every song but my favourits are;These colours dont run, the reincarnation of benjamin, for the greater good of God.Musicianship was great on this album but I felt Bruce's voice was a bit weak or should I say not as great as it normally is."
2,Boring and tedious...,"Producer Kevin Shirley accepts the fact that Steve Harris calls all the cards in the band and we all testified the ""high"" production values utilized by Steve Harris when he produced the band in ""X-Factor"" and ""Virutal XI""... So, since ""Brave New World"" produciton is muddled, really bad and it never improves.This album is another disappointment. Each song is long, long and more long, just for the sake of being long! Choruses are repeated infinitely, Bruce is straining his voice (sometime it's even annoying, believe it or not) and, worst of all, that guy Janick Gers continues there, adding nothing to this band with his crap solos.This album had potential if it had had better production, shorter songs (why, oh why are there the tedious long bass introductions all the time??!!) and a crisp, strong and clean sound??! I simply don't understand, but Steve Harris could not care less for my opinion, so..."
5,Great new album.,"So, I really liked ""Brave New World"", but ""Dance of Death"" I could never really get into. Some of it was ok, but it just sounded like weak rehash of ""Brave New World"". This album, however, was a huge comeback. It sounds like...well, rehash of BNW, but it definitely isn't weak. They come back with focused, energized songwriting, great guitar melodies, and a nice and big sound. I think my favorite is probably ""Brighter Than A Thousand Suns"", but in my opinion there's not a bad song on here. ""Lord of Light"" and ""These Colours Don't Run"" probably sound really cheesy going by the titles, but they're actually really good, especially the latter with its great dynamics and buildup.Well, I am impressed. Great buy if you like Maiden. (New Blind Guardian is even better, though.)"
2,a matter of life and death for Maiden?,"When I saw that Maiden had released a new cd, I was excited. I read the reviews, all were giving it around 4-5 stars. When I listened to it, I found myself hitting the skip button. I want to like this album, I really do, but I don't see anything special about this release. The intros are too long, too boring. Sure, the guitar work is awesome, but the songs all sound the same, to me there is no track that really stands out. I love Maiden, but I still long for the sound of the glory days. Even Brave New World was better quality metal. Don't run to the stores to buy this, ""Run To The Hills"" and pick up their older material, because this one is disappointing."
3,Reality check,"Beware the advice of rabid fans and otherwise clueless people. I'd been a huge Maiden fan for 20+ years but that doesn't mean that everything they record is 5-star material. The album is solid but nothing to get orgasmic about. In fact, it's pretty par for the course considering their recent releases. Maiden fans will be satisfied but anyone else (yes, there are people in the world who don't love Iron Maiden) will probably find it lacking."
2,Plod.,"Plod. That's what this CD does. After the upbeat ""Different World"" this CD is all about the ""Plod"" Most every song has a slow 1-2 minute intro, and a slow 1 minute outro. BORING. I love Maiden, I started listening to them back in 1980 when a friend showed me the first album. This album does not match up. While it is not as bad as the two G-d awful Blaze Maiden albums, it is bad. It's not close to being on par with Brave New Worls or Dance of Death. It's just plain boring. This CD made me sad--I wanted so much more, but I got....this.One star, for ""Different World"", one star because it's Maiden and some of the songs have interesting middle sections. Sigh--should've been so much more."
5,Powerful and a great listen start to finish!,"The riffs are back, from the first song to the last! The band shines on ""For the greater good of God!"" This is a classic album that needs to be heard in order from start to finish. If you can here it through headphones it is an experience to be had as you hear all of these great musicians sync so professionally. Melodic and heavy, you have to pick this one up! MAIDEN IS BACK!!!CJ"
2,POOR PRODUCTION,"No matter how good the tracks(and there's only two good ones on this release), you are simply not going to enjoy it with this poor production. Sounds like it's playing in the next room with the door closed! I'm astonished that Nicko would permit his drumming to sound so flat. The guitars are pushed to the background. Bruce's mid B pitch is grating on the ear. Compare to how good he and the band sound on Brave New World and Dance Of Death. I bought this on CD, so it must be unbearable as a download(in case you don't know, downloaded music loses a significant amount of resolution)."
2,"Not what I expected, but some songs are ok...","If your expecting ""Powerslave"", ""Piece of Mind"" or ""Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son"", then this is not the album for you. I was hoping this was going to be a rockin' album, thinking maybe Iron Maiden would get back to some of there old roots. Well I was definately wrong and this album sounds similar to the last one ""Death on the Road"", which sounds more like a continuation.I am more of an old schooler, and I feel that Iron Maiden didn't put much effort into this album like they did with such albums like ""Powerslave"". Then again this is my personal preference."
1,A collection of amateurish edits,"Actual timings :If My Friends Could See Me Now (edit of lp version) 5:37Don't Give It Up (edit of 2-lp set version) 8:21Runaway Love (12"" version) 9:44Red Light (edit of lp version) 3:30Shoot Your Best Shot (edit of lp version) 6:46From Now On (12"" version) 7:01The edited versions are just the lp versions without the beginning of the song (for the ""Red Light"" and ""Shoot Your Best Shot"") or without the end of the song (for ""If My Friends Could See Me Now"" and ""Don't Give It Up"").Other collections or reissues of the actual lps are available, so don't waste your time and money on this one."
5,The L.A. Graf crew make it happen.,"Commander Sisko, Jadzia-Dax, and Doctor Julian Bashir are summoned by Star Fleet to examine material recovered from an intercepted block of space-debris. This turns out to be the remains of the Defiant and her crew. But from thousands of years in the past. With time against them, Sisko and his colleagues, with assistance from the surviving old, old Dax, have to figure out what happened to the Defiant, and stop the event from happening.I was very impressed with this book's quality of writing; something I don't really expect much of from TV-tie-in titles. ( Okay, K. W. Jeter does good ones, too ). The only letdown was the use, yet again, of the 'Alien' theme, which has by now, I would have thought, been more than flogged to death."
1,Not really,"Maybe it's just that the ST;Deep Space Nine characters aren't enough to carry a book.Maybe you just have to know who and what Dax is and how she relates to the others.But this one got tangled up in time paradox and dragged out and dragged out. Have to admit I didn't finish it. Confusing and shallow and after all is said and done, dull."
2,Romanticized imagining dealing with a wunderkind.,"This book might appeal to a person who doesn't care about history. The nuts and bolts are showing in the plot, and the final love scene is ludicrous."
5,the wizard of oz madison square garden,"When I got it. I thought it was wonderful. To the time that I turned it on in the car, to the time that I listened to it at home. I loved it. every family should buy it. The music was fabulous."
4,"Great Product, Bad Shipping","Overall it was pretty much what I expected as far as quality goes. The wood finish is very glossy and decent quality. The latches and handle aren't the best, I had to tighten the screws so it wouldn't wiggle around as much when you use the handle to carry it. Aside from that it was exactly what I was going for, my boyfriend loves poker, I figured it was about time he had a decent set. What I wasn't pleased with was a dent in the front that I assumed happened during the shipping, its minor but noticeable. I wouldn't mind it much except that I'm giving this as a gift and would have rather it not been damaged. Also I had to glue one of the center supports under the chip holder back into place. Aside from that it's a nice looking case, and it does what it needs to."
5,Insanely great book for teaching literacy!,"If you are a preschool, special education, Kindergarten or first grade teacher, then this book is for you! Sally Moomaw and Brenda Hieronymus are both professors at the Arlitt Child and Family Research and Education Center at the University of Cincinnati. The book is chock-full of literacy ideas for your classroom that are EFFECTIVE, appealing to kids, and just plain fun. There are assessment forms in the back to use with your class, and many of the literacy ideas can be adapted to any book you choose. No fluff, just practical stuff. You'll be happy you have this book and all of their other books in your arsenal of resources!"
4,See for yourself...,"I teach in a Head Start Program. Like children in every classroom, I see a range of literacy skills. This book TRULY offers ideas for individualizing for those different levels. I did not rate it a 4 because I found a deficiency, but because I do not personally believe anything is perfect. Yet, this is pretty good....Go to the bookstore and check it out yourself..."
4,A comeback for Curtis,"This is a lot smoother than the last efforts (There's No Place Like America Today and Give Get Take and Have, my two least favorite Mayfield albums), and a lot better - rather than try to remake himself as a party guy, he mellows out totally, and for the most part forgets about being relevant, in favor of calm love songs (""Show Me Love""; ""Just Want to Be with You""; title song). Those expected the second coming of Superfly were probably gravely disappointed, but if you didn't like love-man Mayfield, that was too bad because here was here to stay at this point. The orchestrations are lush and smooth without being overboard, and there's even some lite funk (""I'm Gonna Win Your Love""). Things only cross into the ""poor"" department on occasion. For whatever reason, the other funk song (""All Night Long"") is uninspiring; ""When You Used to be Mine"" and ""When We're Alone"" are maudlin, which is why I don't like either of them."
4,Priscilla Hauser's Flower Portraits,"Very educational, complete directions on how to paint beautiful flowers for your projects. I got a lot of new ideas. Worth the buy"
3,Reflective shoe strings,While they were delivered fast and was of an exceptional value. Was a little disappointed with their reflective properties. Hopefully that will be improved with future shoestrings.
5,fantastic to read!,"""Can love be strong enough to protect against all winds of life?""""See, God's warriors, what are your weapons? Are they not foremost your shield of faith, your helmet of salvation, and your chain mail of gentleness?""This story makes you think about the was in Holy Land, and back then. About Christians killing Muslims, and Muslims believing they will go straight to heaven if die for faith. There are so much topics covered in the book, that make you compare with current situation. The book is also strategic thinking arise, as planning fights and war are similar to one in business. you can loose one fight, but win the war. Or even that the war is never ending."
5,Fantastic. Simple. Easy. Delicious.,"So far, I've made three meals out of this book. All have been fantastic.I checked the book out of the library and have now ordered one for myself to keep at home. I will continue to try more recipes from this book. Already, the three we tried (mexican lasagna, spicy shrimp and dried fruit pilaf, chicken pesto risotto) are staples on our family menu.I also enjoyed the suggestions at the beginning of the book about making cooking simpler - spending time on Sundays to prep cut veggies for the week, etc.As a busy mother with only basic cooking experience, if I had to live off of one cookbook, this would be it."
5,Leifheit Turner - Excellent,"I found a couple of these turners at a local store a few years back and have been looking for more ever since. For me it is the best quality I have found in this type of item. I love the feel, balance and size. It is slightly more than 12"" long. I bought an Ecco of similar size a couple of weeks ago but it's just not the same. The Ecco had much thicker steel at the flipping end. That may sound good but it makes it very head heavy and I'm not flipping bricks, just eggs and fish. I want a thinner steel to get under the food easier on my carbon steel pan. The Ecco handle had small gaps where the plastic met the metal but the Leifheit handle was perfect. To me It's so well designed and manufactured, I'm buying more of their products."
2,awkward,I do not enjoy working with this turner. It is pretty and heavy duty but awkward for me to use. The last turner I reach for in my collection.
2,Was a fine magazine article; too thin as a book,"This is a superficial treatment of a complex and fascinating subject. There are better popularizations of the topic, with more actual information and a deeper perspective. Check out the Larry Laudan books for facts on risks, and a number of others for the psychology of decision-making in the face of risk. H.W. Lewis's Why Flip a Coin, the Art and Science of Good Decision-Making, is every bit as accessible as this book but has no empty mental calories.Charles Perrow on the complex causes of accidents is terrific, and Edward Tenner (Why Things Bite Back) on the risks inherent in technology are both good.The most valuable part of this book for me was the comprehensive bibliography.Sorry to be a curmudgeon, but this book was a disapointment in an area of great(but not professional) interest to me."
5,A great book! An excellent survey of risk in our lives.,"Mr. Ross has done an excellent job of putting the risks all around us in perspective. He does this through a perfect blend of personal stories, historical events and pure facts. The tough topic of risk analysis is made crystal clear. A great summer read!"
5,A fascinating topic! Well written and provocative.Read it!,"Quite an interesting book. Mr.Ross skillfully strips the topic of ""risk analysis"" away from the stuffy theorizing of collegiate textbooks and creatively applies it to our everyday lives. By identifying and examining the risks inherent in our daily lives,the author exposes some basic flaws in the way each of us perceives risk. With this book,I was able to examine how I personally deal with my daily risks and make my life safer and more worry-free. This book is a must read!"
3,"""Hold Out"" for one of Browne's better albums","Jackson Browne's ""Hold Out"" is not a terrible album. Unfortunately, it gets compared to his 1970s masterpieces like ""For Everyman,"" ""Late for the Sky"" and ""Running on Empty,"" next to which it does, indeed, pale by comparison. That said, there are some good songs here, particularly ""That Girl Could Sing"" and ""Boulevard."" The eight minute cut ""Hold On Hold Out"" that ends the record is also strong. The rest, including the dated ""Disco Apocalypse,"" are decent filler material, though at 7 songs and a just over a half hour running time, the whole project feels slight compared to Browne's best work.Overall, I would recommend ""Hold Out"" for ardent Browne fans and direct causal listeners to his earlier 1970s triumphs instead."
3,Not his best,"I encountered Jackson Browne for the first time when, as a teenager, I listened to the weekly ""American Top 40"" on a radio station in Hong Kong. The song was ""Call it a loan"" and I thought: that's different. I got that record and I loved it. I particularly liked the last 3 numbers: ""Of missing persons"", ""Call it a loan"" and ""hold on hold out"".Then I bought all his earlier records. Jackson Browne's songs were my best companions during my university years. Often, I listened to them during the small hours of the night in my dorm room.""Hold Out"" means something special to me, but I have to admit that all his earlier works were much better. And Jackson Browne of the 80s was nowhere near the Jackson Browne of the 70s."
3,HIT AND MISS,"There are three bona fide masterpieces on this album--""Of Missing Persons"", ""Call it a Loan"" and ""That Girl Could Sing"". But for the first time in JB's career there are duds as well. ""Disco Apocalypse"" was as petulant back then as it is dated today. ""Boulevard"" is ersatz Springsteen, something Jackson just doesn't do well, and ""Hold On Hold Out"" just stinks, especially when you compare it to other extended epics like ""For Everyman"", ""The Pretender"", ""Sky Blue and Black"" and ""Before the Deluge"".As a fan of Jackson's for more than a quarter-century, who has seen him live dozens of times and cherished his recordings, I have to say that this album is. . .not among his best."
2,"Love the music, Don't like the format","I think this is a great album, every song on it. Music gets 5 stars!But this was the first time (and last) I purchased an MP3 from amazon and used the cloud player. It works fine but everything else I have is on iTunes and I'd rather keep everything in the same place. It is not evident that there is an easy way to save the files to my iTunes."
3,A letdown,"After recording masterpiece after masterpiece in the 1970s, Browne's first 1980s album was a disappointment and unfortunately was a harbinger of the musical direction he would take with later albums. This album features the slicker production that would come to dominate (and detract from) his later music. Even so, better songwriting would have enhanced this effort. Only ""That Girl Could Sing"" and ""Hold On Hold Out"" are up to his earlier standards. Overall, a disappoint from an artist capable of better things."
4,Silly me!,"I feel a little silly reviewing Jell-O because it always reminds me of the most sterile of foods. The kind of thing you find in Institutions in general. I do not mean to be disrespectful but it does depress me a little bit. Kind of like meatloaf. You know you reached the bottom of the culinary world when certain types of food arrive to your table. Jell-O Sugar-Free Gelatin Dessert, Orange, 0.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24) is perfect for me: almost no calories, sugar free and tricks the mind into thinking dessert has been served. So let's give Jell-O its due for being a no guilt end of a meal. I bought 3 flavors: Orange, Peach and Black Cherry. Of course I am aware there is very little if any actual fruit but they manage to duplicate the flavors somewhat. How much more elaborate can I be about this product? Silly me! 4 Stars for the good ole' Jell-O!"
3,Had a big gouge in it,"This would have been fine, but it was packaged poorly and had a gouge in the rubber so it ruined the look and the mouse does not slide well."
5,Excellent!,"Excellent, excellent!!! Product was amazingly priced, got here quickly and looks GREAT!!! I am a costume designer and both jackets are being used onstage. They are perfect (and fit perfectly into the show budget.)"
5,One of the best,"Excellent DVD. Nice locations and great soundtrack. All pro riders. Buy it, won't regret it."
2,"Gorgeous photos, not much else","When I got the book I was very excited, it's beautiful to look at, and a simple style is what I like in home design. Unfortunately when I sat down to read I found almost nothing helpful in actually creating a simple, useful room design. Instead there's page after page of beautiful photos, with some interesting but not useful accessorizing tips. For instance, leaving a pair of oriental slippers on the staircase strikes me as more of a navagation hazard than a decorating statement. Also the author's idea of simple seems to have very narrow limits, like using all neutrals with only touches of blue and pink. Or using 1950's style furniture (anybody ever heard of Shaker? Mission? apparently not this lady). If you run into it in a library, leaf through the photos, don't bother reading it."
2,The sames photos everywhere!,"I was known that it would not be a decorating book -- but I was expecting a lot of inspiration to make my home an enviroment of peace and relaxing. And, finally, I was upset and disappointed. I think the author registered only one house's interior -- the same furniture, rooms in different angles every page. There was a pair of pink shoes that appeared three times in different positions, as if their owner was relaxing in same place of this house! Three times! Maybe the photographer wanted to use all the pictures he took, without editing the material very well. I felt the I lost money and time. Sorry."
3,Not what the title suggests,"I give this book 3 stars for lovely photography. But it does not contain many real-world decorating tips and certainly not those in what I would call the romantic style, as the cover claims.Mostly, it is about how to inject a little color and freshness into extremely minimalist and modern rooms. The author does this by using things like a pair of glittery shoes on an old stairway. She's also found of huge gilt mirrors leaned on walls and dressmaker's dummies.The pages are beautiful, but the ideas are not practical. And with the cold minimalist backdrops, not what I would consider romantic either.It's an interesting read, if you like interior design, but the style is not very accessible. It is nothing like Shabby Chic or Cottage. I found it pretentious, impractical, and not at all relaxed."
1,The contents do not seem to go with the title,The book promised me comfort. What I see are very chilly rooms in cool whites and pastels. Nothing comfortable and snuggly here. And there is a lot of repetition in terms of the rooms shown. Also no ideas that I can use. Big waste of money.
1,do not get this,Very bad. makes mold and you can not clean it. very loud also. my kids can not sleep with it on. wast of money.
2,Too many areas for mold,"This was our second humidifer purchase and it didn't last long. We used it on a regular basis in our child's room and were embarrassed by how much mold accumulated in it. Maybe it works OK if you only use for a few days at a time and then empty and dry it, but our child had a cough for nearly a month and we ran it every night. When we attempted to clean it it was impossible to clean all the little places the mold grew. We took it apart, but there was no hope, we couldn't even get to some of the parts. We currently have an animal figured one and not nearly the places for mold to grow."
2,SO loud,"This humidifier functions just fine but it is ridiculously loud. When I read the reviews, I figured a lot of people were just being really sensitive and expected it to be silent. But no. It IS loud. So loud. I miss my cute and quiet penguin Crane. I would have bought another Crane if I had been able to find one in my town. I should have just ordered one online."
1,Moldy and Ridiculously Hard to Clean,"The filter works great, at least initially. However, even when using the Protec cartridges, the internal part of the humidifier builds up mold very quickly. It must be cleaned at least weekly and takes a good 30 - 45 minutes to clean it properly. The instruction manual details how to take it apart and clean it, but it is impossible to clean all of it. Many internal parts are very hard to get at and mold builds up in parts of it that are not accessible."
1,DIED AFTER 6 WEEKS. WILL TAKE THAT LONG 2 REPLACE,"Sadly, this consumer reports high-rated unit died around the 5-6 week mark. I called the manufacturer (which is not Vicks) and they will replace it, but it will take 6 weeks to ship and we have to ship the old one back at our expense. FAIL! Our allergy-laden 6 month old can't wait that long for them to make it right. BIG THUMBS DOWN.P.S. My first AMAZON review, but thought other parents should be aware."
1,Impossible to Clean,"I would not buy this product. While the thought of not having to replace the filters every six weeks may be attractive, the truth is it is impossible to keep clean. I followed the manufacturers instructions and still could not keep it clean. The fan housing is inaccessible and this is where the mold problem exist. I am returning the two I have. Do not buy this product, you will be disappointed."
2,"Noisy, vibrates, and creates much white dust!","I purchased this at Target for $42, and was drawn in by the filterless idea. Big mistake! First the good: it does work fairly well (kept humidity up 10%). Now the bad: it rattles and vibrates (put it on a towel to make it tolerable). And the ugly: it creates an ""enormous"" amount of chalky white dust (the TV screen was covered after a week). Additionally, it was empty every morning, it just couldn't seem to make it through the night.Overall, it works, but at a fairly high trade off. After a week I returned it and purchased a humidifier with a permawick, and the dust is gone!!"
1,Terrible Product!,This humidifier has broken after 30 days of use! Lucky for me! The store where I purchased it from won't honor my return and now I have to deal with the company and the shipping and handling and the mess!I can't tell you about the mold because there hasn't been enough time for it to grow. It's noisy and the film it leaves on everything around it will drive you mad!Avoid this product and avoid this company.
1,IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN,"HORRIBLE PRODUCT. I USED IT 2 DAYS IN A ROW AND WHEN I TOOK IT APART TO CLEAN IT, I WAS MORTIFIED. THE BASE WAS BLACK FROM THE MOLD. I TOOK IT APART AND TRIED TO CLEAN ALL THE MILDEW OFF BUT THERE WERE SO MANY PARTS I COULD NOT EVEN GET TO. IM SO SAD THAT MY SON WAS EXPOSED TO THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!! DO NOT BUY"
1,Piece of junk!,"Vicks claims this unit is 20% quieter than previous models, what did the previous model sound like? A jet liner? This thing had to be designed by an engineering drop out, the fan is made of all plastic and it warps after 3 hours of being on after which point it starts to come into intermittent contact with the unit itself causing a clunking noise. It has so many ""lights"" on it it literally lights the whole freaking room up, I had to get tape out and tape the the freaking thing up so I could sleep in a dark room! I also paid a 100 bucks for this piece of garbage at Target, so yeah!"
1,Worst purchase of my entire life,I bought this piece of junk at target without reading any reviews first. It made my pregnant wife and me sick. Mold and germs grow inside it and there's no way to clean it out. We are going to have to throw it away and take the $60 hit. I've never been so upset w/ a product.
1,Health Hazard,"We bought this to use for our 5 month old who was congested. Within a week there was pink mold and as a previos reviewer wrote, a white film all over everything in the room. Our son ended up more sick after using this product. Do NOT buy this humidifier!"
1,Broke the Same Night I Bought It!,"I learned my lesson; didn't read the Amazon reviews before buying this at a local drugstore- for 2x the price, I might add.It started working well, but by halfway through the evening it stopped dead quiet.I reset it this morning and it worked for all of 5 minutes before dying again. I will be returning this, so frustrating!"
2,Diappointed,Bought this as a replacement for an old Duracraft that I can no longer find filters for. Was initially impressed with filter-free and removable tank for refull. Worked great for 2 nights then became very noisy. So much that I am up at midnight writing this review. Will be returning it.
1,NO!,Noisy Noisy Noisy! I thought I was trying to sleep in the engine room of a crab fishing boat! Took it back and will go get a silent one.
2,Impossible to clean,"I use a humidifier every night in the winter and some nights in the summer due to sinus problems. I bought this humidifier because I was tired of being overly warm from a warm mist model and because it was filterless, which I interpreted as ""easy to care for"". I am no expert, but it seems that the cleaning instructions are intense as well as costly over time, and even when I have followed these to the letter, there is orange and black mold that grows in places that are inaccessible to clean. Even with q-tips and lots of patience. In addition to that, it has filled my entire bedroom with a white film which feels chalky to the touch. The latter issue may be related to the local water, but never in three years did this film appear with my old warm mist model. Did it humidify the room well: yes. Was is quiet: yes. Would I ever in a million years buy it again or recommend it to someone: NO!"
1,Unhealthy,"I bought this a few months back. After using it for just a few days, both my wife and I fell ill. The whole room started to stink! I opened all the nuts and bolts of the unit that I could lay my hands on, and did a thorough cleaning job. No use. within a week it was back to it's old stinky self. I don't use it anymore."
2,Very Loud and Hard to Clean,It vibrates like crazy and is very loud and you just want to shut it off because of the noise.It is also very hard to clean.There are much better choices available.Get something else.
1,BLACK MOLD & STINKY MILDEW,"This is by far the worst humidifier I've ever owned. After a short time of use, BLACK MOLD developed and it is impossible to clean. Black mold forms on the base and in the inner workings that cannot be reached. Dust builds up at the vent that is impossible to clean. After spending hours trying to clean it and getting frustrated, I finally gave up and threw it in the trash. This was a complete waste of money. It is hazardous to your health. I wish I could give it ZERO stars. Please don't waste your money. The room you place it in will smell like stinky mildew."
2,"Broke after 3 months, like all Vicks humidifiers","We've had the less-expensive Vicks humidifiers in the past, and they always break. We figured an upgrade to the ""fancy"" filterless model would mean higher quality. No such luck. The plastic casing broke after a month, and the entire apparatus that draws the water from the tank into the humidifier broke a couple months later. Now it's yet another Vicks humidifier filling up the landfill, only at a higher price tag."
3,Not for bedroom use - effective yet noisy,"I've had this humidifier for a year now. We bought it last year on sale at Walgreens for $45 (down from their price of $59). It worked very well at first though it was exceptionally loud. It sounds like a generator and it was so bad that you cannot even have a conversation in the same room when it's going.Cleanup is fairly easy and it didn't leak very much except the one time that we apparently overfilled it a bit. It does a good job at what it's designed to do I just wish it wasn't so loud. I'm trying to find a replacement for it now that I can keep in the bedroom. (the room we had it in was 20x14 so it's fairly powerful)I've had units that were cheaper than this that do just as good of a job though so I'm not sure if it's really worth the ""value"""
1,Too loud!,"Do not buy the filter free Vicks humidifiers. When running, even in the lowest setting, it sounds like someone is running a chainsaw or leaf blower in my room! Neither I, nor my boyfriend, can sleep with this machine running. We both hate this machine. It is too noisy! I can get used to noise but this machine doesn't make one consistent noise...it instead keeps making different loud noises, just like a chainsaw does. Instead buy the Vicks Ultrasonic cool humidifier that comes with a filter. I purchased that later and it is much quieter and works well.EDIT: I contacted the company and they told me that this unit should not be this loud. There may be something wrong with it that I have to fix or have the company fix. Leaving up original review only because a unit right out of the box should work correctly and the other unit I reviewed (that Vicks makes) did work correctly out of the box."
1,Don't bother,"This is the worst humidifier ever, gets moldy even with daily cleaning with vinegar. Don't waste your money. I wouldn't give it any stars but you have to at least choose one."
1,Do not buy,This thing makes so much noise - it actually vibrates. Forget it. The cleaning process is also so time consuming.
2,Vicks V45000,"This product started off working great, but after about 3 weeks the motor burned out and it would only turn on 50% of the time. Would not recommend!"
2,Filter free = high maintenance,"I got this for my baby's room. I thought the filter-free idea was great. Not so much. It is pretty loud regardless of the setting (I use the lowest setting). It can also make a small room quite cold. My biggest complaint is the film that is produced. Even with cleaning this thing constantly, there is a thin white film that builds up on ANYTHING within 4 feet of this thing...windows, furniture, & probably my baby."
4,Very effective for the price,"I don;t understand why this humidifier has no many poor reviews. It's in the ""Recommended"" category on Consumer Reports.It is very good at pumping out moist air, lasts an entire evening or longer and very easy to refill. It is a little on the noisy side, but only because of the rushing air sound. The motor is quiet. If you have a lot of minerals in your water and don't use distilled water, yes it will ""look"" dirty, but the operation is not affected. Just wash the parts you can in soapy water to minimize germ build up , or run vinegar through it. All humidifiers have one type of build up or filter issue.Definitely worth the money if you can deal with the minor draw backs. Consumer Reports rated this unit correctly as ""Recommended""."
1,DIRT AND MOLD IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN,"I agree with the reviews about the dirt and mold build up that you cannot clean. I've tried getting my hand down into the machine to clean the build-up, but all i managed to do was scrape up my hands. The more i've tried to clean the housing, the worse it's gotten. This morning i just have given up and will be throwing this humidifier in the garbadge. Also, after using for a while, it did start vibrating a lot so that my kids would complain about the noise. we would stick a wipe between the fan unit and the water tank to stop lessen the vibration."
1,POOR QUALITY & NOISY,"Just bought this yesterday & after one night I cant wait to return it. I was trying to decide between this and the Crane Frog humidifier which we had last time (was dropped and broken, but worked great! This one was SO LOUD that it sounded like my neighbor was cutting his lawn and it vibrated the whole table it was on. This machine also has two nightlights on it that are like 2 headlights in the room - way too bright. I will buy the Crane Frog humidifier again instead, which made almost NO noise whatsoever and the tiny light on it was not bothersome. Do not waste your money on this Vicks humidifer!!"
1,Horrible - Loud - will wet everything around.,We bought 2 of these for our twins (one in each room). This humidifier is horrible. it's LOUD! and sprays so much (even in the lowest settings) that by morning everything around the humidifier is wet (ie Carpet). We had to put a couple towels around it since we were afraid of mode sinking in the carpet because of it. We finally replace them but don't waste your money of this model - it's absolutely crap.
2,Cleaning nightmare,"I asked my cleaner lady to help clean this thing after a couple of uses and she threatened to quit.The instructions that come with this piece of junk mention that it needs cleaning every week but with daily usage, it needs cleaning every day and oh by the way you need white vinegar to clean it. If you don't an ugly looking pink stuff (mostly bacteria) starts formning in the vents and there's nothing you do can clean it.The only good thing is that it does humidify the room pretty quickly. I am now in the process of throwing away this as I need to take half a day off to clean this beast."
1,Horrible,"Deserves no stars. Went through 2 since they simply stop working. Black mold magnet and impossible to clean. The screws wont even come off if you DO want to attempt to take it apart.But whats that point. Even if you could clean it, they stop working."
1,I would not buy this again,This humidifier worked great for a few days. Then it grew mold even though I emptied and dried it everyday. And it grew the mold in hard to reach places so I couldn't clean it. Then after 3 months it started to make loud noises and the mold inside was growing everywhere. I couldn't wait to get rid of it at the end of winter even though it was still under the 2 year warranty. I did not want to replace it under warranty because I didn't want another one so I tossed it at the end of the winter. We used it for about 4 months and that was it - and I could barely stand using it that long! The only positive was that the water tank has a big hole so you can reach and clean the inside but none of the mold grew inside the water tank!
2,Ok Humidity BUT Beware if you have hard water,I went off the recommendation from Consumer Reports which rated this as a Best Buy. But it leaves a fine film of white powder over everything in the room after using for just 8 hours!
1,Junk Junk Junk,"As my title states, this is what your buying. It is noisy, had a lot of buildup on the vents, mold grew inside which had a bad odor, and finally it stopped working. I called the company and they want me to pay to have it shipped back. I have a feeling that they've had a lot of calls about this unit. On a previous call, I was also told that I should buy some pipe cleaners to clean out the mold and buildup. Maybe this will save some other other people $50. I'm taking mine to the garbage."
2,"NOT ""whisper quiet""","This product says it is ""whisper quiet"" and the box says ""27% quieter than the Hunter Carefree"", so we thought it would actually be quiet. Sorry, but this thing has a fan that is way too loud even on low, unlike our old one, which made almost no noise at all."
2,"Noisy, but it works","It works great to add humidity to the air and I was attracted to the filterless machine but out of all the humidifiers I have owned, it is definitely the noisiest. I will be returning it because it is difficult to hear over top of it running when it is on the high setting, which we need to keep enough humidity in our house. For the price, I think it will be worth it to spend just a little more and get something quieter."
2,TOO LOUD!!!,"I should have looked at reviews for this humidifier. This thing is way to loud! Whoever said it is whisper quiet is apparently hard of hearing. I am on my laptop, listening to music, typing this review and I mostly hear the humidifier."
2,Frickin Loud!,"Seems to do a good job at humidifying but I returned it for two BIG reasons. First; because on high it sounds like a diesel generator (even louder heard through ceiling downstairs.) Second, because if you try to move it, water spills internally and then drains out of a little hole all over your floor, I'm talking a LOT of water! You have to take it apart and drain the tray before you move it to avoid a giant mess.I used it for about two weeks and couldn't take it anymore. I replaced it with a 'Venta-Sonic VS207' which ROCKS. So nice, so quiet, fantastic output, digital humidity indicator. etc... Costs $40 more but WELL worth it. Best humidifier I've used."
2,Mildew and scale build up,"I had opted for a cool mist unit over a warm mist unit because I wanted to avoid the molds that frequently build up with the warm mist units. This unit worked well for a while, although running all night significantly cooled the room down a few degrees. I cleaned it regularly with white vinegar, etc, but it still developed a pink scale throughout the interior of the unit, some of it I couldn't remove because it wasn't accessible by hand. I unplugged the thing, called Kaz (the manufacturer) and they claimed the pink build up is due to the water I am using, but still offered to replace it, as long as I sent it back.I will likely send it back for a replacement, but I don't think I would opt to buy this unit again."
1,Not a vaporizer,"My biggest complaint is that this model is not a vaporizer, but rather a cool mist type of humidifer. Meaning that it uses an impeller to break up the water and emits a mist, rather than heating up the water and emitting steam.My second complaint is that the thing stopped working after one night. It just gets no power when plugged in now."
1,Waste of Money,Extremely loud.Mineral dust coated everything after just one use. We continued using it for a month but it never got any better.Can't last the night on high without running out of water.Water distribution was too heavy in the air and made the room feel too wet.
3,"This item does raise humidity, but does not contain anything to prevent white powdering of all items in the house",We still are having a problem with a heavy white powder settling over everything in the house after we use the humidifier for several days. Once a week I clean out the parts per the instructions given. I don't think the little round ball does anything.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS USELESS MACHINE,"So I just bought this humidifier from Target a couple of days ago and I have been testing it out for almost a week now and it ABSOLUTELY sucks!It was expensive for no reason. I get really dry throat and nose in the morning and this did not do anything. It made an immense amount of noise that could not even be justified by telling myself ""this 'white noise' is good for me."" I was so outraged by this product that I wrote my first review of an item. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"
1,Very quiet because it's broken after 10 days!,"This worked great at first. Noisy but that helped me sleep. After 5 days it stopped working, but I somehow managed to get it going again. It lights up, and you can hear a slight click when you move the humidity % dial, but it never cuts on.Now again it's doing the same thing and Vicks has 0 support information for the product. P&G; doesn't even recognize the product either. My feedback would be to the Holmes products. Just as noisy but they consistently work (I have 2 different models). Don't waste money on this one - as you'll spend more to get something else."
4,not bad at all,"I have only used this product for about one month,but it has done well It puts about one gallon of water into the air each day. It helps keep the house from becoming too dry in the winter--our skin doesn't crack and split so much.I don't know whether it will hold up for long. You need to clean it out about once a week or it gets funky from some growth in it. Maybe I could put a little more clorox in it, but I think it actually sucks in the dirt in order to blow out the air. The thing that Vicks sells to cut down on growth is too expensive to use at @$8 a pop. Its not so ""cute"" as most of the humidifiers sold."
1,wasteful/uncleanable/harbors mold/takes a lot of time to maintain,"The directions say to empty the tray and clean daily.You have to dump the water from the tray, take off the bottom, soak in vinegar or bleach waterThen put it back together.Mold still forms in the bottom and inside the unit and fan area that you cannot reach or get to.We also have a lot of minerals that are stuck in the machine and have made it a reddish tinge.Totally will NOT buy another one.NOT worth the trouble of not buying a filter."
2,Leaves a white film..spills easily,"This humidifier leaves a white film on everything....I guess I need to use distilled water for this humidifier which can be quite expensive.I would not recommend this unless you like white dust on everything and want to pay for distilled water everyday. It also uses alot of water. I woke up this morning with an asthma attack like I haven't had in years, and I am assuming the film has absolutely everything to do with it."
1,Stopped working after 2 months,I've purchased two of the Vick's FilterFree Humidifiers so far and both of them stopped working after 2 months. The humidifier is loud and leaves a sticky film over the furniture. Do not buy!
1,Kept this less than one day,"Not only is it noisy, it puts out so much 'mist' that everything near it was dripping within an hour. No way would I recommend this to anyone unless you need it for your greenhouse."
1,quit after 3 weeks!!,This item just quit working after 3 weeks!!!! I'm sending it back! I would not recommend this plus it grows mold/algee quickly!
1,No such thing as filter-less (black mold & pink mildew abounds!),"I've had this unit for five months and dropped the Protect cartridge in there every month on the 12th to keep it clean. Despite these efforts, it has developed a pink film along with black mold that you can smell when it operates. I'm having trouble breathing. The area that is affected is IMPOSSIBLE to get to in order to clean it even with pressurized air. My unit has also flooded on two occassions destroying everything on my dresser.I contacted Kaz who makes the unit. They said they would replace it but I'd be out of a unit for 6-8 weeks and I'd have to pay shipping costs. They will not replace it with another unit so I'm sure the same problem will reoccur. I decided to clean the unit the best that I can (this took 2 hours) and use liquid bacteriostatic water treatment instead of the worthless Protect cartridges. I hope this works."
2,Not sure it is worth the money,"I read all of the reviews about this product before purchasing. I took a chance. The humidifier works OK, and so far is easy to clean. It is noisy. If you are looking for something really quiet, get an ultrasonic humidifier! This was too loud for my kids bedroom at night, but it work well in the living room during the day. If I had to do over, I would not have purchased."
2,Can't Clean,"I agree with so many others. It worked while it worked, but now there is pink grime built up in the motor part that I can't clean.Update: I just took an hour to take apart and clean the motor part of this humidifier that is hardest to clean. With my OCD efforts, I was unable to truly clean it. That, and it now only works on the highest setting. Definitely going to be replacing this soon."
3,"Not a bad machine, but loud","this machine was supposed to be quiet, but on 'high' it's is rather loud. by far the loudest of any humidifier I've ever owned. also, the water vapor comes out the top and tends to spit out onto the ground around it. so i keep a towel under the unit to catch the moisture that lands on the floor. it's not a lot, but it does make the floor a bit damp. but, the sound is way too loud for a quiet machine. the rest of it is fine."
1,MOLDY Humidifier,"DO not buy! This humidifier seemingly worked, but after a week, gave off a terrible smell; very moldy and disgusting. Impossible to clean."
3,OK humidifier,I bought this humidifier in 2007. My son had RSV and croup all the time so this was what we needed. It did well for us all these years. It does leak if its not completely level but if placed on a level surface it does well. It is a pain to clean and it is by no means quiet which is why i only gave it 3 stars. It does the trip if you need moisture in the air quick. You do have to replace the water a lot but i like that it doesn't sit in there long. I love that you can put the vicks pads in it since you cant use vicks on a baby! The pads help with little coughs and colds!
1,Vicks V4500 humidifier,This humidifier is a disaster. It leaked all over my floors three times and I returned the canister for a new one. I don't trust it on my floor. The cap is too difficult to screw shut so I am considering tossing it in garbage. It is noisy and causes mold.
2,Like Sleeping Next to a Engine,"Loud. Loud. Loud. It does humidify the room effectively, but the noise is just too much to warrant purchasing this product. Oh, and the ""night light"" illuminates the entire room in a green glow. I thought I was in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' with this thing on."
1,Don't waste your money,"I, as others, were attracted to the filter free aspect of this humidifier. I also liked that it was a Vick's and I could use the scented pads for my baby girl. Unfortunately it would gunk up constantly and even though I tried cleaning several times after a few uses, it never got fully cleaned. The noise didn't bother me, even though it's louder than our other humidifier. My daughter liked the white noise and it never bothered her. But the humidifier would smell and eventually after continued use at night in her room, it started leaving a white film on the walls and things nearby that I had to clean. I only used the low setting and really did want to keep it but it got so disgusting that I gave up using it for fear that she would be breathing in the stinky fumes. I would not recommend this product and currently we are looking for a replacement for her room."
1,Loud and hard to clean,"I totally regret this purchase and will be looking for another humidifier. Even through the closed door of the nursery I can hear this thing in the middle of the night. Every once in a while, it will not make such obnoxious noises, but that will only last for a few seconds. Also, the only area you can easily clean is the tank itself. Which will only last for part of a day on the lowest settings."
1,white stuff everywhere,Don't waste your money. I obviously don't have time to clean this out constantly and it left residue all over anything around this product. I will be purchasing a different one and out the money by this wonderful filter free humidifier.
1,LEAKY!! PURE JUNK,"I purchased this humidifier and it is nothing but junk. After the second use, it leaked all over. It has a 12 hour span of time before refilling. If you are looking for a humidifier, this is NOT it!"
3,Good Product But Cannot Productively Clean,"Had this for a week, but plan to return it.Pros: Not disturbingly noisyNice size accommodates a medium sized roomOne fill lasts a whole nightCan visibly see the mist it producesNo filter to replaceDoesn't leakCons: Can't clean hard to reach ventsBrown scum formed in vents just after 3 usesLeaves moldy/mildew smellHigh cleaning maintenanceOverall not a bad product, but leaves me to wonder if the air is healthy to breathe with the bacteria and brown scum it forms in the vents that you cannot reach to clean (which is why I'm returning it)."
3,very loud,"I liked the idea of no filter, so I bought this. It is super loud, even on the lowest setting. The highest setting sounds like a plane taking off.. LOL. I wouldnt recommend this if you plan on using it at night while you sleep, unless you like white noise."
1,MOLD EVERYWHERE!!!!!,"This product does NOT deserve 1 star. They should have a negative rating scale...I spent $75 for it at my local drug store because I thought the idea of not having a filter to change would be great. What a MISTAKE! I bought this for my 8 month old daughter's room and cleaned the machine religiously according to the booklet instructions only to find a month later that the fan housing (which you are NOT supposed to clean) was filled with pink and black mold EVERYWHERE. I am scared that my daughter has been breathing in this junk for over a month now, 10-12 hours every night!When I called the manufacturer they told me to use pressurized air to clean the fan housing. This did NOTHING to remedy the problem. Buying this machine was a huge mistake!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Mold...pink film...after SIX weeks!,"I got a great deal on this (normally expensive) product about 6 weeks ago. I was thrilled to see it actually provided moisture, because I have a two year old in day care who needs a humidifier run every night. I went to do the weekly maintenance a few nights ago, and THROUGHOUT the motor housing is a pink film (we get this in the shower too) as well as mold spores. You can't clean the motor housing, so it's ruined. I called Vick's and they will send us a new one when I send this one back. Not sure if I will. The only option they gave me to clean it was to use pressurized air! Well I don't trust it enough to clean in the places I can't see...so no thanks. I did ask if they had this issue before with this machine and they told me ""no."" Looking at the other reviews, I see this isn't true. My son will probably be labeled asthmatic when he is old enough for the diagnosis, so I am obviously concerned about a product that grows mold."
1,Horrible!,The biggest problem I have with this product is the SMELL!! I even clean it every 2 days and the mold smell will not go away. My room smelled like a moldy gym locker room. Wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased. Complete waste of money.
1,I hate this humidifier! I miss my one with a filter!,"I bought this one because I clean my humidifiers very well and figured I can save some money on filters and just keep it clean.. Well, If I ever try to clean it well, I end up hurting myself trying to get the stuff off of the inside that smells. I cut my self last time. I am going to toss this one and get back my old one with a filter so I can just replace that and clean the parts that need the cleaning... not trying to deep clean it all."
1,Why do they make and sell this?! It's awful!,"I wish I had read the reviews for this humidifier before I purchased it. Initially, it had a louder hum, which I didn't mind as it created white noise for my baby. I consistently clean my humidifiers weekly. Regardless, this started to stink (like body odor) after 1 month. You can't get under the major plate and can actually peek and see the mold growing. In addition, without using purified water, it will spread the minerals/white film over EVERYTHING in the room. Now, after 3 months, the motor makes a loud roaring sound. I immediately unplugged it, and threw it out. Why do they still make this?"
3,No Instructions included,"Product itself works okay, but the unit supplied as new from Walmart arrived without any instructions and appeared to have been repackaged. It may be a new unit, but one that wasn't supplied in a factory sealed box. I wouldn't advise using Walmart on line."
2,This thing roars,"It usually seems to me that people exaggerate a little in their reviews of ""noisy"" appliances, but his thing IS ridiculously loud on low speed. I put it around a corner in my bedroom area because it was so noisy, and even that didn't help. I expect a noisy humidifier on high, but also expect to be able to have it do it's job quietly on low. I purchased this locally, and am returning it today."
1,"Serious health hazard,worst humidifier","There was too much of moisture in room which made my carpet, walls and bed damp and the Corner were I kept was wet alongwith floors and tables too. As if someone is drying wet clothe in my room.. Next morning I was feeling so sick. Complete wastage of money."
1,FORGET MOLD WHAT ABOUT THE RUST ?!?!?!?,"I bought this product when my 1 year old son came down with a cold. It seemed to work pretty well.....then I took it out of his room to put it away. The whole inside was completely covered in disgusting black mold, but wait there's more.....I understand that wherever there is water you run the risk of developing a mold problem, so I decided to take it apart, clean it up, dry it off, and pack it away for future use. A couple months later my son developed a terrible cold, so of course I took out the humidifier and not only was it not working, but further investigation showed that it was totally inoperable due to a SEVERE rust problem. This thing was created for use with water! There should NEVER be such rust and corrosion in an item like this ESPECIALLY AFTER JUST 2 USES!Vicks should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a terrible product!"
4,Well Paced And Lots Of Action,"This review concerns the original 1942 edition. Mr. Hardy's case of thieves stealing merchandise as it is being unloaded from ships leads Frank and Joe into another case concerning a broken sword blade. This book is well written, fast paced, has plenty of action and has a good beginning that quickly grabs the reader. My big problem with the book was that, while Mr. Hardy played a prominent role in this book, he was the only one of the other main characters of the series to do so, since most of the book was set outside of Bayport. Still, it was a really good book that most Hardy Boys fans should enjoy."
5,The Mystery,"Reviewed by BenjaminDo you like a book with adventure and humor? Then Hardy Boys - The Clue of the Broken Blade by Franklin W. Dixon is the best book for you to read.First, it's exciting. The Hardys go to find an ancient blade. But thieves are after it too. They even got kidnapped and locked inside a house. Will they escape and find the blade? Get the book to find out the ending.Second, it also has good humor. Their friend Chet is always eating stuff. They also wash up to an all-girl's camp.My recommendation is that if you like a book with adventure and humor you will be sure to like this book too. It is a good book."
3,A broken part of a famous sword is missing!,In this cool book a famous piece or sword is missing. the Hardy boys try to find it but they must first beat a few dangeoras crimminals first.
3,Plenty of action,This review pertains to the revised edition: This was good book. Lots of action from start to end. I would highly reccomend reading it. I was not real crazy about the last chapter. It lacked creativity but otherwise the book is worthy of an average rating.
1,LAME!!!,"I really have no clue where all the positive ratings for this book came from. i thought from the reviews that this would be quality reading, but I found it dull, insipid, rather tawdry fiction. It made me feel like my brain was made of porridge."
3,Shallow and predictable,"If I had not bought the paperback of this novel, I may not have finished it but since I paid hardearned money for it, I had to read it. The title tells it all. Why the father did not do more to verify what had happened to his child and her mother after he returned from WWII is hard to believe. I'm getting tired of shallow and predictable books. Any suggestions, anyone?"
2,"Pleasant read, novel story line","It's about time that Canada is recognized as a legitimate part of the world. This book has an interesting premise--that of a child abandoned during World War II after she has been shipped to Canada for safety's sake. My interest was piqued by the geneology involved when trying to identify the child's family 55 years later--possibly due to my own interest in our family heritage and our European ""roots."" The protagonist, Erin, is a solid, dependable woman and daughter. I truly enjoyed the book, the romantic subplot, and the well-written characters. I will pursue other books by this author."
2,Fame Kills,"The CBB had a hit with ""Couldn't Get It Right"" and it was the end of a great band. Most of the rest of the tracks on this album are marginal at best, and all of the following albums struggle to find focus.Too much money, too much fame, maybe they attracted the wrong kind of producers or took too many drugs -- whatever the reason it was the beginning of the end. Too bad. When they were hot, they were really hot."
3,Commercial Success Leads To Disappointing Release,"""Couldn't Get It Right"" got it right commercially for the CBB. However, for many of their fans, this album was a huge letdown because it lacked many of the blues and progressive elements of previous releases. Disco was becoming popular during this time and was taking up much of the radio airwaves. Unfortunately, to some, this impacted the direction CBB would take. Gone (for the most part) are the blistering lead guitar licks of Peter Haycock. Enter more of the funky, disco rhythms and sax of Colin Cooper. For those who like the older CBB material, ""Rollin' Home"", which is quite good, and possibly, ""Extra"", are worth noting. The rest is less notable and par for the course, radio friendly muck, that isn't so ""Sav'ry"" for my taste."
5,Wonderful advice to begin a career,"This book has great advice for beginning a new job, from what to focus on to how to get ahead. Mr. White offers great examples, including his personal CEO background and other CEOs he interviewed for the book. I highly recommend this book for anyone graduating from college or switching jobs."
2,"Feel good book, but filled with anecdotes and lots of gray","This book is much like Prof. White's class at Northwestern, it sounds great at first, but if you actually stop and think about what is being said (ironically employing a lot of what White is recommending) you start to realize that it is just a collection of anecdotes and quotations that are intended to make you feel good and to get motivated.This book isn't horrible and I am sure many new hires, fresh out of college, will feel good about what is being said and will gain some self confidence in the process. Unfortunately much of the statements in this book are corollary, have little or no factual basis and are not all that insightful, but rather common sense stuff. Call this book what it is, a self-help guide, a motivational text, but certainly not an insider's guide, nor insightful advice from a CEO."
1,This book stinks ...killing trees to make this garbage,I like how all these reviewers come out of nowhere to rank the book 5 stars. I bet it's the author or somebody who works for William White (the author) who is creating all these Amazon accounts and giving himself/themselves 5 stars.I pity these fools. The book makes a great dust-jacket ornament
5,A book for all stages in your career...,"Looking for your first job? Or maybe you're an experienced professional trying to launch a new career? Whatever your experience or profession, this book has an abundance of helpful information. From building a credible professional reputation, to identifying companies most likely to hire you, William White provides solid tips on effectively marketing yourself. (Reviewed by Marion E. Gold, author of ""Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU."")"
2,Slow Speed Chase,"RE: AUDIO CASSETTE VERSION. In this Cold War curiosity, the Catholic cardinal of a Russian puppet state must balance the forces of the secret police on the one hand and the ""patriotic clergy"" on the other, while struggling to maintain his own link with God. The character study of the hero is strong enough that the reader may be carried well into the tale before realizing that nothing much actually happens. The baddies are not ruthless enough and the promised action is never delivered so that ultimately the story is as gray and drab as everyday life may have been in such a place."
2,Cheap product has already broken,At first I was pleased with this product. I keep have to reset this product because it will not remain still. So yesterday when I had to reset it in the ground the botton part broke off. So now it is just a straight stake in the ground. Not worth the money.
1,This is a fascinating work of Plagarism,"This book is nothing more than a companion to Lydia Cabrera's work, El Monte, except nothing is mentioned about this author. The stories, the anecdotes, even the pictures are the same ones found in that book! The reason why most people consider this an excellent work is that they can't read Spanish! One of the few original chapters which is on Palo is totally repulsive to me. As a santero and palero I am offended to read that all of us are evil according to Ms. Cabrera. I have met some Paleros that are kind, loving, and very good people while I know of some pretty nasty santeros that don't practice palo at all. Just a humble opinion from a Cuban who ""made saint"" in Cuba, you are better off staying away from this book. While most books on santeria written in english leave something to be desired, You might be better with Raul Canizares, At least the writing is original and not plagarized. Ache to all on the path."
1,This book is full of inaccuracies,"If someone is searching for information on the Lukumi faith this is not the book. It may satisfy some people's curiosity but all in all, there are other authors that can give a much better, and in depth explanation of the religion. If you want information on the religion and can read Spanish, please read anything by Lydia Cabrera. If you cannot read Spanish, I would recommend Osun Across the Waters: an African Goddess in the Americas, or ANY book by John Mason."
3,Santeria African Magic in Latin America,"Basically a smaller version of Santeria The Religion, a book that I had also purchased! I'm not saying that its bad. But it was mostly excerpts from that book over and over and over"
1,Santeria : African Magic in Latin America,"I do not recommend this book at all, it give the author false impression on the religion. From what I know from well known elders she is not even and initiate. Santeria is a beautifull religion, but authors like this one who give a false account..On having a deep rich experience on the religion are full of it. The elder's that I have spoken to do not even respect what she had written. Save your money for a book that speak the truth and not this one......Child of Oshun"
5,Into the Fire,"A book that is not for everyone, yet everyone should see it. These are the faces of death and despair, the tears of anti-war, the bravery of war, the fear of not living another day, the fear of living yet another day...the courage, the persistance, the failure to give up...the hurt, the pain, the tears, the anger..in the lives that nightmares are made of... When you look at the photographs, you will never be the same. Study them. Let them go to your heart. Cry for them. Then reach out to them. And never, never forget......when I went into the Inferno, I never realized the impact it would have. We can be so distant to the people, but in this book...they come into our lives, making us aware that the world can be a living hell. James Nachtwey did a fantastic job catching the lives that we so often want to pretend don't exist. I highly recommend this book to all. Step into the fire. We all need to see........"
3,A thought-provoking picture of our world,"This is a disturbing book. It is considered a classic in the world of news photography. It shows what happens when things go very wrong in our world. It would be nice to say these are all isolated incidences. However, they are not. In spite of talk about ""progress"", the number of people living in slums in our world is growing. If we were to have a very serious economic or environmental crisis, the pictures in this book could be a vision of the future. The author's work is more well-known in Europe than in the U.S. where such raw images are usually not published in the major media. However, you should look at this book. It will make you think."
1,NOT A FIRST EDITION,"The site lists this as a first edition, it is not. This is a 2007 reprinting. If that does not matter to you, go ahead and buy it, it is an amazing volume."
5,The book everyone needs to see,"These exquisitely beautiful and painful photographs bear witness to human suffering many of us otherwise might not see. Nachtwey has said it is his responsibility to record these images, and show the world. It is our responsibility as mindful beings to engage with them. This book will broaden your world and invite you to consider your connection to all who inhabit it. To view it is nothing short of a spiritual act."
5,A Terrible Beauty,"I find that the words ""a terrible beauty"" sum up this masterpiece by James Nachtwey. These pictures deeply affected me beyond the written word. Sometimes a simple picture can portray so much. As a student of economic and international relations these images are what keeps me going, I want to be the idealist that believes that I can make a change too. Every time I see Nachtwey's images I can feel his appeal to the reader to make a difference or at the very least to be aware of global issues. People get so caught up in their own pain that one forgets the harsh reality imposed upon others in countries ravaged by war, ethnic genocide and famine. The picture plate of the skeletal man crawling on his hands and knees left a deep impact on me as well as the plate of the Rwandan man ravaged and violated by a machete from his own people. Indeed, as the Italian poet Dante described in ""Inferno"" these images describe the nine cirlces of hell."
3,Honest Photographs,"I am priviledged to have had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Nachtwey about his book inferno. Speaking with him made me feel much better about looking at the book. As a documentary photographer myself, I am aware of how people could be taken advantage of by the photographer.It comforted me to hear Mr. Nachtwey speak in length and in detail about the empathy he has for the people in the photographs.What is most important, is that he is making these photographs for the people in them, not for himself."
1,Artistic Fraud,"What a disappointment! This self indulgent wallow in self importance has convinced the photographer and the editor that this is serious art. Don't be fooled. Natchwey's high fashion compositions cheapen the suffering experienced by the subjects. Thanks to the photographer, I expected to see Naomi Campbell walk through the horror of refugee camps in Zaire. As Natchwey voyeuristically fetishsizes his subjects, he loses all sense of time and place. The viewer can't tell if photos are of Chechnya or Kosovo and I don't Natchwey knows either."
4,..And if you should live up in the hills...,"This beautiful album of roots music draws power from its simplicity - reflecting the earthbound, day-to-day strength and struggle of Jamaica's country people. It evokes sunshine and banana trees, dreads and livity, children and solidarity - and of course the flame that keeps the album burnin', Mr. Winston Rodney AKA Burning Spear has a voice to match his thick, strong, and flowing dreads. Irie I."
3,Was a good value for a laptop... back in 2002 !,"When we got this back in 2002 it was fine for a student, surfing the Web, running Office applications, etc. It had lots of USB ports and connections, a big screen, generous hard drive (30 GB was pretty good in 02!), a DVD-ROM / CD-RW and Windows XP Home.The world has changed since then however, and this laptop is now totally outdated. It lacks the most common features like USB2, built in WiFi, DVD R/W, wide screen and the 1+ GB RAM you need to run XP and most modern apps at a reasonable speed.We have it hooked up to the stereo as a dedicated MP3 player / Internet radio streamer (with a wireless USB adapter), and it works OK. It's slow as hell though so I might have to upgrade the RAM.I think with Toshiba's Satellite notebooks, you get a lot for the money. Just don't expect to be using the same computer in 3-4 years, this stuff just gets obsolete quicker and quicker."
2,"""Used"" to like Toshiba products","I truly used to like Toshiba products. Now, I do not see myself buying any of their products again. This machine has been reliable for the last two years but the hard drive broke today. When I called customer/ technical support all that they told me is that it is out of warranty and that I can send it to them and have it repaired at full price. I know people have complained that this model Toshiba has broken down on them after only a few months of use but I still find it unacceptable that the hard drive world brake down and fail after only two years. My other laptop from Compaq lasted over 6 years. It is out dated obviously but it still works. In short, I do not recommend this laptop because it is way too heavy, gets too hot, and has a short battery life. Oh, and Toshiba customer support is the worst that I have ever experienced. They will not be ashamed to hang up on you if you are not satisfied with their ""reading from a script"" answers to you problems."
3,Very Slow,"It is a very nice portable, the screen is quite large so your eyes are going to be quite comfortable, BUT it is very slow. It isn't worth the money that you save. For most applications 1.2 GHZ is nothing and the processor gets very hot and noisy. The hard drive gets very noisy as well. I've had mine for 5 months now and I really need to replace it. In short, I don't really recommend it."
2,The money saved is not worth it,"Well, while it is a good value based pc it isnt reliable or recommendable. The pc was owned for 3 months before it started exhibiting unreliable behaviour. Then at the 5 month mark it started shutting itself down. I thought it to be a power management problem and since I had just installed a wireless network card I assumed that I just needed to go back through the settings and make sure nothing had changed. 3 weeks later before I got around to finding the problem the machine died in the middle of the night. Now, upon trying to boot it makes a horrible popping sound and shuts itself back off again. From all research materials I have found this make and model is plagued with overheating and shorting problems. My recommendation would be to go with a little more expensive better quality machine. This one just isnt worth the trouble."
4,"tight, energenic, funky fun","This stuff sounds like it's straight outta the 70's. It's very much in the spirit of the James Brown groovefests like ""Superbad"" and ""Sex Machine."" If anything, the imitation is a little too spot on. The superfluous grunts, exclamations, and exhortations can come dangerously close to parody in spots-- but they stop just short of that, I think, and so the record does succeed as a genuine homage, and a genuine good time in its own right."
5,Sweet Beats,"Could've been faster, but super rad and relatively cheap. Not available at most retail stores. I'm happy."
5,Young artists love this..,This was a big big hit with my 6 year old grandson. He was thrilled to get it as a gift and has enjoyed using it from the start.
4,Good product,"My skin is combination and sensitive. And I'm 29.I like this moisturizer. But it does not work if there is any king of stress to my skin. If I travel my skin does not adjust to this moisturizer fast enough. This is the only downside of this product for me.Otherwise it's nice, very light texture, not oily at all."
1,Nothing worse than over-commiting and under-delivering!,"I purchased this pricey product because on the label it states that it ""Kills On Contact"". I drenched three indoor plants with 12oz and unless you heard the insects into a pool and drown them with it you may not see any results. To me if the label states it will kill on contact, then short of clobbering them with a bat I would expect them to at least keel over and cough. Hair spray worked better. I did not even rate this one star.Alan A."
2,"Killed bugs after a while, but also killed plants.","I bought this for my houseplants/patio plants. After a few minutes the bugs were dead (not exactly ""on contact""). The worse part, though, is that it damaged my plants!! My dracaena and peace lily now has black leaves after using this product!! Only time will tell if my plants will actually live...but I guess that means I won't have to worry about bugs if I don't have the plant either. :("
1,"Doesn't work, it suxor.","Used this on some fungus gnats. Drenching them with the spray doesn't work. Soaking the potted plants I have with it doesn't kill the fungus. I have some wood bits in my potting soil that have fungus on them. I'm not seeing it suffer after spraying them with this spray. I've had it about a week now and I've almost used it all. What a waste of money. Personally, I would get some Daconil fungicide. That stuff actually works! This stuff suxor!"
3,Had to return this one ...,"Just a heads up. I was looking for a product like this to fit onto either of my telescopic monopods, tools I use as hiking staffs that I can also use to stabilize my cameras when shooting photos afield. I contacted the nice folks at Tracks to ask if the thread would fit a standard camera. They said yes, and as it turns out, the thread IS correct for North America. (The thread in the UK is larger.) However, the female thread is so recessed into the knob that it can't hook up with the male thread on the pod. This was true for both my monopods, a good Giottos and an inexpensive, lightweight Targus.No animosity toward the manufacturer at all. It's a perfectly good product. And, thanks to Amazon's painless return policy, it was no trouble at all. I just wanted folks to know that there's a good chance that this will not suffice if you are looking to use it on something other than a Tracks hiking staff."
5,Raves!,"What a refreshing, beautifully written book. I felt I was there, inside the mythical Central African country, knowing the people, what they eat, what occupies their minds, how their days are structured...the author's inclusion of authentic detail makes it all live. The gifted child Alinofe Banda and the fat Mamsahib missionary doctor Pia Macloed, will certainly go down as two of my all-time favorite characters in literature. Of course from the title I expected a story about the great plague AIDS, but it in the end is much more a story of people, personalizing the universal themes and questions regarding love, sex, faith, family, morality, death and meaning. It left me wanting to hear much more from this wonderful writer."
1,who knew it could be so bad?,"With Eastwood directing and Whitaker in the lead, you'd think this would be a great movie. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. The pace is so slow that, without the music breaks, it would have been totally unbearable. However, we kept watching, hoping it would get better. It never did."
5,classic roots,"Once you have become accustomed to other roots offerings of this era, this is a terrific CD to try out. Truly exemplifies reggae of this yime period, and provides a deliciously sweet counterpoint to the less sultry roots tunes of the time. If you like reggae from the 70's, you'll love this CD. Although many of the tracks are reversioned classics (their own classics) this is how reggae is done...the tracks are simply updated, not forced. Book of rules is perhaps one of the most iconic songs in reggae, certainly a definitive song for the post studio-one heptones."
3,Disappointing,"Frustrating to use if one is looking for words in Polish. Words found in the English-Polish section are not always contained in the Polish-English section, and some of the more common roots or infinitives simply aren't there."
4,"Concise, many entries, good introduction to phonetics","For the small size book - this dictionary contains a good amount of words, with a pronunciation and some extra information about phonetics, kanguage origin, differences etc. Yes, some words are missing, especially from the modern world etc - but almost all the most common or popular words are there; the guide to the phonetics and the menu guides help also. I give this book a strong 4 stars!"
5,2 1/2 Year-old Grandson loves it,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old grandson to help him understand Christmas. His mom says that he absolutely loves it, especially all the scratching and sniffing."
3,Pretty Good One,"This Christmas Sesame Street CD is pretty good; however, I do not appreciate the 4th track which is a song sung by Oscar the Grouch about how stupid Christmas is, and how much he hates it. Those are not the kind of thoughts, nor words I want my 2 and 5yr old girls hearing, and especially not in relation to Christmas! All of the other songs are great, and we enjoy singing them together in the car almost every day. We just hit skip when the 4th song comes on...my girls call it the ""naughty song."""
4,I've Thought It Over!,"Cissy Houston's Think It Over cd is da bomb. I, for one, love the old school disco and this cd definately makes you want to boogie!Wow, what a voice. The fruit didn't fall far from the tree where Cissy & Whitney are concerned.You don't even have to think it over, this is a must have."
5,Say hello to musical history...,"And an endlessly listenable compilation of the real masters of reggae/rocksteady. The songs from this film inspired everyone from The Clash to Stevie Wonder. THIS ALBUM CONTAINS NO BOB MARLEY!!! And that's a good opportunity to branch out and really dip your hands into a unique culture, and a worldwide musical phenomenon."
4,Not Roots Reggae But Good For What It Is,"Many people associate Jimmy Cliff with Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. They were all early stars of reggae. But Cliff's music is actually quite different. It has less of the heavy bass and drums sound of the Wailers, with more influence from pop, soul and R&B.; Cliff's lyrics are very personal and perhaps his greatest strength as an artist. I especially like his song ""Sitting In Limbo"", which Jerry Garcia and David Grisman do an excellent version of on one of their albums. The Melodians' ""Rivers Of Babylon"" and the Maytals' ""Pressure Drop are two of the other cuts I most enjoyed.This is distinctively Jamaican music. But drawn more from the ska and rocky steady eras. If you want the heavy duty roots reggae I would instead recommend artists like Peter Tosh and Burning Spear. But this is still good for what it is."
4,"culture, good things.","I have already pachase this cd, thank for your offer. it's nice doing business with you, look forward for some more business.,"
5,classic reggae from the movie of the same name; a must-have,this CD reissue of the classic Bob Marley soundtrack is a must-have for Reggae fans and the place to start for any music-lovers who have yet to become acquainted with Jamaican music
3,Not as reggae as I wanted,I am a bit disappointed in the CD. It doesn't seem to be REAL reggae as I think of it. It seems more like Americanized reggae. Maybe I just need to get a Marley CD. 'You Can Get It If You Really Want' sounds like a song from Sesame Street.
4,"culture, good things.","I have already pachase this cd, thanks for your offer. it's nice doing business with you, look forward for some more business.,"
1,A Extremely basic book.,"This book is extremely basic, I believe that the help files are more complete that this book. It does help but it does not go in depth at all. I think I wasted my money, because I could of read the help file and probably get more out of it. I have read introduction books on other subjects that are a lot more complete. Also, the book was very poorly printed (a whole bunch of black and white xerox copies). Since it is spiral bound in a small spiral it is hard to turn the pages. It is not worth what I paid for it."
2,Music to soothe the mind,"In our home we listen to Country-Western, Classic Rock, Oldies and more. On Sunday mornings, sitting on the patio, enjoying our coffee and each other, we listen to this CD. We love Tangerine Dream's work and, living in such close proximity to The Canyon, we relate to this one."
3,"Yes, You Can","IF YOU LIKE CURTIS MAYFFIELD ! U CAN BUY THIS C'D, TRUST ME, BUY THIS GOOD ONE ! OK, a lot of ""Medium & high frequencyS"" > """"""1980/90 strange mix"""""" but i like it."
2,"Good Story, Not So Good Presentation - a review of ""Remaking the Earth""","I so wanted to like this book. We have been reading about different cultures and beliefs lately and this tale of creation seemed like it would fit in very well. Unfortunately it didn't make for a very good read-aloud (my children are 4 and 6); and consequently wasn't very popular.I tried reading it for my own enjoyment, being interesting in such matters, but can't really give it a thumbs up for adult reading either. Verbiage just sort of lays there and is not as inspired as the artwork nor the tale.Two Stars. [D+]. Interesting artwork. Bad Read-aloud. Interesting story - if it were only told in more pleasing form. There is much here that parallels the Judeo-Christian stories of creation and flood."
5,singing and dancing at its finest,"the rhythm kings sing, dance and play insturments to songs of the 30's and more. their three part harmonies are excellant. The act is original and very up beat. they have backed Tommy Tune for years but very fine act on their own. Its a great 30 minute diversion."
4,At their best,"Heirs to the twin traditions of 60s psychadelic pop and British 80s indie (a less cynical Smiths, at times), The Boy With The Arab Strap is Belle and Sebastian at their best - sweet, literate indie which isn't quite as fey as some of their other releases, and just glides through the course of an album. The best track by a country mile is the utterly gorgeous 'Sleep The Clock Around', which features wide-eyed vocals, an aching melody, and a burgeoning arrangement which gradually builds into a gentle cascade of tumbling drums, bleeping synths, and later, quirkily, bagpipies. But there are other good tracks: in particular the upbeat 'Dirty Dream Number Two', which contains a great melody and a perfectly executed string arrangement, along with some almost funk-influenced guitar work, and the jangle-pop of the lovely 'A Summer Wasting'. Reccomended even to the sceptical."
4,Ease your feet off in the sea...,"Beauty is one of the simplest words i can use to describe the complexity of this album and its songs. Belle and Sebastion scored with me, and all fans on this one. Their mix of folk/rock/euro-pop makes them an essential to any music collector or fan. I can't get enough of this band or this album. Check out Tigermilk (their debut) its just as good. I can't wait for the next Belle and Sebastian release!"
4,"Engaging ""Goof-Rock""","Like picking your nose, ""Arab Strap"" is kind of a guilty pleasure; you feel sheepish diving in, but because of Strap's zany, catchy sound you can't stop digging. With a sound that recalls the proto-""goof rockers"" ""The Beautiful South,"" B&S flicks off some delightful aural nuggets; the last track on the album is especially juicy. This monument to ""Prance-Core"" is extremely satisfying but is best listened to in private."
1,This CD stinks,"For a band that's been around for a few years, Belle & Sebastian sound like a couple of kids down in the basement rehearsing for a high school talent show. They sound amateurish, the instrumentation is awful, the songs are boring and wimpy, and what's more, none of them can sing...especially the woman on Is It Wicked Not To Care....thinking about it makes me cringe. This CD is better used as a mini-frisbee or a coaster; don't waste your money, it STINKS."
2,This band is WAAAYYY too cool for me.,"I, like most fans, jumped on the Belle and Sebastian bandwagon. I heard them a few times, then went out and bought 2 full lengths and 2 eps. And you know what... when i actually think about it, and put this disc on. I REALLY don't like this type of music at all. It's very pansey and weak. This music is for people who are weak, both physically and mentally. The guys voice is just plain annoying. I'm sick of this ""psuedo experimental"" indie pop. This disc sucks, and so does the band. B&S are just too trendy for me. I'm either missing something, or not ""cool"" enough to be into it. The songs are boring and tired. Spend your money elsewhere. Buy a ""Rachel's"" disc, or a ""HOOD"" album instead."
3,Not that good....not that bad,"Good songs, nice lyrics, soft sound...BeS won't certainly change our world but they do know how to write nice melodies you would sing under the shower or to your little son. Nothing seems to go farther than ""nice"", everything's entertaining, but some could underline the lack of a climax, i.e. a really impressive song, even tough some could say the title track could fit.In any case i find this album quite entertaining and well played.Unfortunately this comes up with awful production and the worst recording ever seen on earth after 2nd World War. High frequences seem soooo high (2nd song, around 2,40) while parts of some songs are impossible to be heard without raising the voulme (1st song, 2,22).In conclusion a good job, but I can't agree giving 5 stars to this album. It's enjoyable but some songs look like filler (some well played indeed, but still fillers, some useless, as A space boy dream) and recording would get zero stars at all!"
4,Still The Best.,"Belle and Sebastian's third album is still the best. Combining the simple guitar, cello, and trumpet of their previous two releases with an expanded orchestra section, this record is good from start to finish. The only misstep was the decision to include Stuart David's A Space Boy Dream. This expiremental spoken word track ruins the cohesiveness of an otherwise perfect record. It's clear Stuart Murdoch hasn't abandoned the quiet ballads of his former records, but the rollicking title track is a sign of the more rock-oriented albums to come. If you want the best respresentation of Belle and Sebastian's early period, buy If You're Feeling Sinister. If you want the best representation of Belle and Sebastian's entire output, buy The Boy With The Arab Strap."
5,"Buy it or not, but give it the time if you do","Why it sat on my shelf for so long, I don't know. Initially, it felt too simple, too primitive. Then hours after a listen that I had hardly paid attention too, I found myself humming the incredibly addictive melodies. Now, having just listened to a fresh copy of REM's masterpiece Murmur, I find the comparison apt. An album full of little songs that gain strength and lean on each other to build an astonishingly impressive structure, as simply framed as a dome, and as difficult to knock down. Are you going to agree with all of the 5-star reviews here, or with all of the 1-star reviews? There's only one way to find out, but if you do buy it, give it the time that I didn't, and you may just find your favorite album of quite some time."
2,yawn,"I bought becuase I heard the title track, Roller Coaster Ride and a few others from a friend, and hoped that the rest of the album would be as good. Unfortunantly, it's not. Those songs and a couple others are nice, but kind of trite, and the rest of the tunes, especially those sung by other the band members, are downright lame. This album has some bright spots, but it's real fault is that it totally lacks dynamics. A real yawn-fest."
4,"Not as good as ""If you're feeling sinister""","The two first songs are incredible. When I heard them for the first time, I thought ""WOW, they're doing it again!!"" but then I was a little disappointed by the rest of the album even if I loved songs like ""Dirty dream N2"" or ""Seymour Stein"".Try the singles!! Most of them are marvels!"
3,the biggest let down of the year,"i knew thy had to break down sooner or later!! this band managed to releasetwo albums and three singles with not one bad song--UNTIL NOW. with the exception of one or two songs this album is really lame. the magic is all gone, they can break up now."
3,Sleep fodder for insomniacs,"After a few quiet listens the melodies hit the spot and I was soon humming myself to sleep. The Smiths comparisons are obvious (look at the packaging) but while the Smiths could be overbearing at times, Belle & Sebastian choose to be subtle, providing the perfect backdrop for laziness."
2,Belle and Sebastian = 90s Herman Hermits,"I really really don't get what all the fuss is about. Listen carefully to old Herman Hermits records (or maybe even the Monkees), and you'll see there's not much difference between the two. Belle and Sebastian is an awfully sentimental group; their lyrics are maudlin and preening, and even when they concoct a catchy hook, the arrangements are slight and wispish. The lead singer doesn't have an ounce of grit; your average coffee-shop singer voice, I guess. Please...trust me. Ten years from now you'll think to yourself ""how could I listen to such saccharine music?"" and shake your head sadly at the follies of youth, and sell this CD to Disc-Go-Round."
3,Not good... but definetly not bad,"I can't count how many times I have listened to ""If you're feeling sinister"". If you are a Belle and Sebastian fan, you know that most of their songs are written and sung by Stuart Murdoch. Arab Strap is a compilation of songs from all the band members, and in my opinion, it takes away from their sound. While the other bandmembers are all fantastic, they are part of a band, and Murdoch is the songwriter. A failed experimentation, but definetly worth buying."
3,I wish I could understand the hype...,"I bought this cd by the recommendation of a few friends, and I had briefly heard a few tracks and was interested, but now that I own it, I find listening to it a chore...I find the tunes to be a little too sing songy and flighty, and his voice to be annoying at times, however, I do see talent in the band and hope that perhaps some of their other albums will strike a differnt chord with me. I still don't understand the hype..."
1,Terrible,"Someone gave me this disc and the result was a lot of lost time and productivity in my life.Seriously - This album doesn't make any impression either musicaly or lyrically. It is totaly forgetable and leads you to complete nothingness. Its like eating the main course only to find yourself still hungry, ordering another meal to eventually find yourself broke and starving. Its as harmless as raindrops in a puddle and there is no beauty or melancholy here - rather a complete and utter experience of blandness.Perhaps the ultra-fragile types on the verge of a physical and mental breakdown might find temporary sedation in this and no doubt intellectuals and critics worldwide will praise it."
5,Fantastic!,One of the best albums of the year - a friend introduced me to this band and they have been on my CD player ever since. Laid back melodic music with fantastic vocals. Different and highly recommended.
5,A Classic & Must-Have Belle & Sebastian Album,"I completely disagree with the review below. ""The Boy With the Arab Strap"" is one of my favorite Belle & Sebastian albums. It was my first impression of Belle & Sebastian; it made a very strong one, too. I believe it is one of their most ingenious albums. Like all of Belle & Sebastian's albums, it takes a musically trained ear as well as an appreciation for style and meaning in music in order to appreciate and enjoy them. Many of my favorite songs of all time are on this album: ""Sleep Around the Clock,"" ""It Could've Been a Brilliant Career,"" and ""Dirty Dream Number Two."" Along with these songs, almost all the songs on this album have very touching meanings in their lyrics and innovative composition. I have listened to this album dozens of times and each time I hear and appreciate something new within each song. It is a must buy for any Belle & Sebastian fan."
4,Okay but better than the Kornloving antiB&S haters think,"This was a solid album. The ability to record such an album in this day and age seems impossible for the majority of musicians today. This is the kind of album that you expect the intellectual guys from your high school band to put out. It had the potential of being great yet somewhere around track five lost that potential. I would have given it three stars but only the B&S haters seem to want to do that. By the way, picnics are perfectly acceptable before a concert and I'm not a poofter."
3,"Not as good as Sinister, but still worthy","I rushed to the store the Tuesday ""The Boy with the Arab Strap"" came out with high hopes. When I got home to listen to it, I was both shocked and disappointed. Not only had Belle and Sebastian lightened their already deathly soft sound even more, but they were slipping! The songs weren't as catchy, as funny anymore. After a couple days I tossed the CD into the corner in favor of its more worthy brethren, ""If You're Feeling Sinister."" A couple weeks ago, though, I decided to give ""Arab Strap"" another chance, and for some reason it started to grow on me. The songs on here aren't all great - ""Seymour Stein"" sounds really, really whiny to these ears - but they all add up to a pretty good album. First-time Belle and Sebastian listeners, however, should opt for the earlier, better album until buying this one."
4,"Still good, thought provoking music being made...","Definitely not what I'd expected. I'm quite pleased to add this recording to my large collection of music, it certainly qualifies as ""unique"" in more ways than one, meriting its addition."
1,broke within 2 hours,"I like that these are larger than most children's maracas and my girls loved them immediately, but these are very cheaply made and split in 1/2 the 1st day. They need to be handled very gently."
4,Very Funny,"For those who have friends and workers that are as thick as a brick, this book is for you. It will give comic reliefe to those who see the oddities of life."
3,someone the pinhead,"thi book is satisfying and fun.zippy is bizzare and doesn't make much sense, so I only give it 3 stars."
5,Dvd/cd Cabinet,"I was pleased with my cabinet and may buy a 2nd one. The only real problem was that we got 2 right doors so my husband had to redo the hardware on one to make it a left door. Also the screws didn't match up with the holes so we had to force them but all in all I am happy with it, it's what I expected and had read the other reviews so knew what to expect."
2,Better for just Boston,"This book was fine for touring around Boston. It was very informative. As far as the rest of New England, there must be something better. We found ourselves in the middle of some great towns with nothing more than a couple of sentences, if that, about the area. After getting out of the car and exploring, we found many interesting sites and attractions. If we made our decisions based completely on the book we would have passed up many interesting stops. Next time we travel in New England, we will buy a different book."
5,A Beautifully Crafted Book,"I live in New England and this is one of my favorite books on this region of the country. DK has always published quality books in their Eyewitness Travel Guides. They seem to have done an even better job with the crafting of this book. The colorful layout of this book with maps, illustrations, photographs and text really captures the spirit of New England past and present. This is a very dear and heartening book because it genuinely captures a sense of the people and the land. I think it is also very informative, not only from a historical perspective, but as a point of reference for sightseeing, travel and enjoyment."
5,Great book,Great explanations for the theories behind reliability methods used within research for engineering design today. I have used the book almost religiously in my studies.
5,Not for Beginners,"This book is a sequel to First Year Latin and is intended to be accompanied by the Latin Grammar book. It would be impossible for a beginner to learn Latin from this book -- it assumes the reader has already covered Henle's First Year Latin (which can take up to two years to complete). The first half of the book is divided into three parts: Julius Caesar and Roman Imperialism in Gaul; Roman Imperialism in Gaul; and Jesus Christus Rex Regum. The sections on Caesar and Rome relate historical events, in Latin, with some explanatory paragraphs in English. The section on Jesus Christ is a short series of essays, also in Latin, discussing his life and effect on man. Throughout these readings there are lists of Words to Remember. The second half of the book is devoted to exercises based on the readings. At the back of the book is a classified word list and an English-Latin vocabulary."
4,"Jazz on a Harp - No, Really","I have enjoyed Ms. Vivona's live performances when I lived in Tucson, and I have her first recording ""Radience"". Still, I have to admit that when I first heard of jazz and old standards being played on a harp, I was skeptical. But I was pleasantly surprised. This album is incredible, and Ms. Vivona is amazing. I have listened to this album over and over and over again. It is definitely upbeat and a great album to listen to. I have been recommending it to everyone I can who enjoys jazz, the old standards, and acoustic music. I'm looking forward to see what she does next."
2,no conclusion,"Well, i believe that the study was genuine but there are no conclusions. If the movie had to go back to its sources about Jesus being in India mentioned in the Tibetian Texts, we would be satisfied. Its a half baked story. So a half baked story is no story at all.I believe that the American establishment is covering up for the truth. They dont want there to be scandal. Teh reasin they allowed China to take over tibet, its because there's a bigger stake in Christ. Which they got soo wrong.Iraq invaded KuwIT AND there was a war. But China invaded Tibet and there was no war. I saw americans discover ancient sanskrit texts in a temple which is now china [tibet] and their commentary was ""Oh! here are some more ancient chinese texts"". While we know what sanskrit looks like. since im form India. But hey, the truth is best told by the strong and mighty.So please dont expect to get anything form this book. or DVD.There is no conclusion."
2,Well it got me to Nebraska....,For main highways it's great. Several times when I was looking for secondary or unmaintained surface roads the maps were inaccurate with roads drawn in the wrong place. A lot of times the only way I have to navigate a new road or area is to look at the shape of the road or it's distance in relation to a known highway. The Nebraska Gazeteer was off several times. I had to spend a lot of time backtracking and getting help from locals.
4,Great Book for Beginner Sailing,I love how easy to read Basic Keelboat is. I am glad I made this purchase for this sailing book. It's an amazing reference to have at hand for future needs.
2,Very disapointing,"I used to be a huge X-Men/Chris Clairmont/Jim Lee fan and bought this because it came out right after I had stopped collecting. I was very disapointed. The story is weak, and the art is even weaker, except for the Jim Lee issues. The whole thing seems rushed and thrown together, with a very contrived plot, as if they needed a cross over story arc to sell more New Mutants and X-Factor books. Not recommended"
3,Not bad as far as crossovers go,"Good:-Jim Lee's Art-The crossover has lasting impact to the X-Men mythology-Plenty of action-It's good to see our heroes hit the lowest level and beaten to the ground in a mutant hostile territory and somehow come out on top in the end.Bad:-The New Mutants and X-Factor artists-If Cable didn't spell the end for the New Mutants as we knew them, then this crossover surely destroyed them.-This fast paced type of crossover would become the model for all other crappy crossovers in the future. Mutant Massacre was classic. Inferno complicated, but I liked it. I enjoyed X-tinction Agenda, but Marvel got out of hand with the crossovers after this."
2,This is not the TPB,"If you read the other reviews on this book, you'll be mistaken about this edition. This book is a kids' storybook version of the X-tinction Agenda storyline. It is NOT a reproduction of the original comics. There is a TPB of this storyline, but this book is not it. Don't make the same mistake i did in buying it if you want the TPB."
4,X-men Xtinction Agenda,This graphic novel is a classic! One of the best X-story lines ever. Great artwork and good story telling.Features the whole X Universe.
2,not good....except for jim lee,right lets make this very clear there are only 3 good issues out of the nine here...the actual x men issues with art by jim lee and scott williams are essential...claremonts words and lees pencils have always been a good combo...the fight scenes are dramatic and exciting and everythings...well...everythings just righthoweverthe other 6 coming from new mutants and x factor are crap...the arts rubbish and especially by the last 2 chapters you just want it to end...seriously it just drags on...they lose their powers get em back...still they get beat down. dont know about you but i dont particularly enjoy watching the x men lose fight after fight after fight (which they seemed to do a lot of in the late 80s early 90s) unfortuantely its quite an essential story as it brings all the x men back together after a few years apartbuy it for jim lee and try to stomach the other stories
2,waste of money,"don't bother with this, unless you meet the following:1. you are 13 years or younger2. you need this to complete your xmen collection3. you read at a fourth grade leveli may be being really really harsh here...the problem is the new mutant and xfactor issues, the xmen issues are actually pretty entertaining and have decent artwork. buy this at your own risk. i give it 2 stars based on the fact that lee was involved."
3,A third of it's good...,"I agree with a bunch of these reviews. Jim Lee is amazing. Even 20 years ago (sniff, and it has been that long), he was amazing. Rob...not so much. Bogdonove...just plain bad. Is it a great story? No. But, it's still near and dear to my heart. This is when i finally got out from under my parents' thumb and started to collect Uncanny Xmen. Been at it ever since. And this is what defined Wolverine and my love for the New Mutants. I still think it's worth the read. Warning: just thumb through chapters 2,3,5,6,8, and 9. Soak in the other 3. LOL"
5,grandma,"Couldn't find these anywhere in stores, so finally ordered online--so glad I did. Arrived promptly in nice plastic container."
2,Disappointed,"The dosage climbing collection is definitely one of the best out there, but I have to say Volume II was a big disappointment. The footage of Sharma and Loskot deepwater soloing in Mallorca was awesome but other than that it was pretty sub-par. I think what really killed it for me was Ivan Greene. I hate seeing this lifestyle and sport being represented by someone like that. It was painful to watch the whole segment on him. Great climber, but when I think of BigUp I picture Sharma or Graham dominating a crazy V14, not some ego-maniac misrepresenting the sport of rock climbing. I've come to expect a lot out of Josh Lowell after seeing some of his amazing work, so maybe this was just a minor bump in his career."
4,Worked Fine,"I used this to replace a broken 4100 under AT&T DSL in Northern California. Worked fine. I just reset the device, plugged in and logged on to ISP with password, set to Bridge to use my Router, and all is fine. Good price, works fine."
3,Do you want power Supply?,"If you want a power supply, make sure it comes with your order. Mine did not. I was disappointed. It is important."
5,great record,"The bass line on the title track is one of the greatest ever written, the horns are just brilliant, really beautiful music here, but tame compared to what was coming down the road from ""Chally"". Why atlantic hasn't put out a better version of this is a great mystery, The Clowns has been given better treatment even. Still, one must make do, as this isn't music one should really live without."
5,Fantastic,Charles Mingus Hits Hard on This Disc.The music here is Fantastic.His Tones&Arrangements are Incredible.Music Like this is Timeless.Quality with a Capitol Q.Mingus is One Of The Baddest Musicians&Genius's ever.this is a Must have.
4,Mingus' Classic Updated For a Better Look and Sound!,This mini-lp replica sleeve is a real treat for fans as it very faithfully copies in great detail the original lp design. The remastered sound also makes the sound quality of this album a real pleasure to listen to as well. This is a worthwhile addition to any jazz fan's musical library. Recommended.
3,These are mis-labeled as pulls. They are escutcheons.,"These are not actually handles. These are actually meant to be decorative only and to install them, you insert them into pre-drilled holes. They would go where there is a fake drawer, like where the sink is, for example. The original photo shows the front of them and they are pretty and shiny. But when I went to install them, I realized that they are meant to used as decoration. If you want to use them as handles on a drawer, the screws supplied are too short and you will have to find longer ones. This should really be 1 star because they are not pulls or handles. I was able to find some nice handles elsewhere for close to the same price. That being said, the service was good and and I think it is an honest mistake because when you first look at them, they do look like handles."
4,Nice Enough,"I live in a rental house and wanted some cheap handles, and purchased these. They look very nice on my doors and drawers. They are too short for larger fingers, but larger fingers can grab the sides.I did go buy longer screws for the drawers. After that I was told that I could have used an attachment and countersunk the screws to make them work. Oh well. Still less than $30 for a kitchen full of handles."
5,Makes my cabinets looked GOOD!,I just had my kitchen remodeled and the satin chrome pulls look really nice with my new cabinets. I am so pleased... They look expensive but I purchased them at a reasonable price compared to Homedepot or Lowes. I put them on all my cabinets.
3,Barney MacFadden First Son of Physical Culture,"A very good book which gets only three stars because it glosses over MacFadden's career as a wrestler, and his days with wrestling's ""Three Musketeers"" of Missouri: John C. Meyer, George Baptiste, and himself. MacFadden did jump out of an airplane over the age of 80 though, which is pretty cool.Incidentally, MacFadden inaccurately labels himself as america's ""Father of Physical Culture,"" when that title actually went to William Muldoon, former graeco-roman champion wrestler, who died in 1933, and reigned as champion thru the 1880s."
3,spring the extra money for a cage with bearings,"overall this is a pretty good machine, but its downfall is that it uses ""ultra glide bushings"" this might sound good but it absolutly isnt. Compared to other machines with bearings this isnt so good, the bushings will need to be lubricated and would soon stick again.just spring the extra cash and get a machine with bearings."
5,A sharp watch,This is a great watch for dress or casual wear. The photo does not do it justice. The silver areas are very shiny. The gold parts are not dark yellow; the gold color is muted and reflecting.
5,Understanding life patterns using astrology,In the beginning the science and art of Jyothish can be difficult because understanding the science can be foreboding In this set of CD's Chokoisky demonstrates the art of Jyothish and makes it fun and understandable for those who want access to this profound science for understanding themselves as well as their relationships without having to spend a lot of time in study A definite practical tool
5,"Simple, In-Depth, and Easy to Understand!","I've tried to read A LOT of books on Jyotish, and been frustrated by how much memorization and work you need to learn just a little bit about yourself. Watching these DVDs and scrolling through the chapters, I learned to understand my own chart and even other people's charts very quickly. It's surprisingly simple, and I think both beginners and intermediate students (like ME!) can benefit from it... I also bought this for friends and family because it makes a nice gift!"
4,Does not fit the Hollywood Racks HR1000 Sport Rider 2-Bike Platform Style Hitch Mount Rack,Does not work with the Hollywood Racks HR1000 Sport Rider 2-Bike Platform Style Hitch Mount Rack even though Amazon advertises them together. Order the Hollywood Racks LHPTC.
2,Does not work with Thule Racks,"The hitch pin doesn't work with the Thule bike rack that I bought it for. It's too thick, and I have doubts that it would fit other racks. I may drill out the rack so that it can fit though as it seems like a reasonably well made pin for the price.In retrospect I would have probably just gotten the Thule pin though it's more money"
2,Only option for the iPod Shuffle,"After a long search this is the only product I found that would work wih the iPod Shuffle. It is very simple to use, but the sound quality isn't all that great. The volume is low and there is interference with all 3 station options for transmission. I would buy this only if you owned an iPod Shuffle because it's your only option."
3,it is not compatible with iphone,you have to connect the iphone in the doc and then the transmitter charger to that to work. also there are ony 4 frequencies and they are not so good ..but it works for basic stuff. just have to change frequency if there is a problem..
3,"Not a feminist polemic, nor ""cultural criticism""","This is foremost a history, and has a focus rather more restricted than its title would suggest, surveying the careers and lives of thirty women and thirty (male) ministers involved in the ""feminization"" of northeastern Victorian America. The author convinced me in arguing for the significance of said feminization, but I felt burdened by all the biographical minutiae. One has to ignore reams of trivia to grasp the larger themes hinted at in the titles of the chapters (e.g., ""The Escape From History,"" ""The Domestication of Death). Where the author breaks the tedium with an impassioned commentary, she seems to be writing a different book altogether. But Douglas's treatment of the theme is original and even-handed, and her short biography of Margaret Fuller compensates for the tiresome church histories."
1,"Tiresome, Uninformative","Bought this book as a spinoff to a seminar hoping for some insight into a complex subject. The common cause made between ineffectual clergy of the late 18th century and American women was interesting, but then the author lost herself (and her theme) in her exhausting review of obscure, forgettable literature. The phrase ""deadly dull"" comes to mind.The book is more notable for what it does not address than for what it does."
1,???,"No guided meditation, just sounds. Create success? If you're looking for a guided meditation, this is not for you. I was expecting something else."
1,What....?,"Compared to other listening CDs (success, etc.), this CD is horrible. I do not recommend this product at all."
4,Still wonderful after all these years,"I first heard this album when I was in college in the early '80's, and became a reggae fan because of albums like this one and because of True Democracy. I'm disappointed that the cover on this CD is not the original. The original had a picture of the band (similar look to True Democracy's cover)...I wonder why it's now released on CD with a very bland cover.Steel Pulse was at their peak in the early '80's (Earth Crisis was also excellent, along with True Democracy and this one), before getting too much into electronic drums and synthesizers. If you want a reggae album that is roots-based and will have you playing it on a regular basis, consider this one a must."
2,I had some problems with this book,"I respect Zig Zigler very much. My husband has MS and when he discovered this he read one of Mr. Ziglar's books that promoted positive thinking. It has helped him tremedously to live his life to the fullest in spite of this disease. I consider myself a Christian. My grandson died two years ago at age 22. The problem with this book for me is that it gave me the impression that Mr. Ziglar believes that in order to ""get to the right place"" you have to have accepted Christ. The God that I believe in accepts everyone. Me as a Christian and my neighbor that might have not known Christ......there is not just one way to ""get there."" My grandson was still searching and ""if"" he had not accepted Christianity before he died I refuse to believe that ""my God"" does not welcome him."
5,Great!!!,I loved it. Very helpful. I was first told about the book during a Grief Share class. I had just lost my daughter who died of the same thing that took Zig Ziglar's daughter so I felt a kinship. It really met my need at the time. I believe it could help anyone with a loss of a loved one. You can not only feel thier pain but also know where they get hope and strength. I hope all Grief Share classes will use this. I will pass this on to all my friends.
5,excellent,"In September of 2005, my daughter and her husband were both killed in a automobile accident. Needleess to say we were devistated. A close friend gave us a copy of Zig's book ""Confessions of a Grieving Christian"". My wife and I have referred to it several times. It's comforting to know that even though our faith in God is strong, that the emotions we have are similar to those that others have and we are normal."
1,"Right reason, wrong ideas...","Let me start off by saying this is not a totally evil book, itwas written by people who care about children, but I do not agree withthier views. Become involved in your childs life, before they get music cd's and go see movies, etc... Do research, then if it's not to your personal taste explain why. Don't choose soley on ratings systems , etc... pg-13 movies can be as offensive as R or nc-17 movies, same is true for music, I know of many different albums out there that DONT have the lyrics warning on them but are very offensive."
5,Great Book,"This is the best book to date on Coach Wooden. He is an outstanding person who was able to motivate his players to be their best, without putting undue pressure on them. The Pyramid of Success can be helpful for business people, athletes, teachers, students, and just about everyone looking into learing a new philosophy on life. Great book. Highly recommend it."
2,"Wooden Great, Book Not","The subject of this book, legendary Coach John Wooden, deserves to have a better book written about him than this. This book goes all over the place.I would have liked for the book to have more of a logical progression.Also, we read this book in our book club and all of us decided that this book was just plain boring. Our next book is the one written by Wooden himself, and I am not sure why we just didn't start with that one."
2,"TRUTHFULLY, I'LL PROBABLY NEVER USE IT.","TRUTHFULLY, I'LL PROBABLY NEVER USE IT UNLESS I'M IN SOME SORT OF A SOLDERING REMOVAL PINCH. THE TIP IS TOO BIG AND CLUMSY TO REACH INTO SMALL TOLERANCE PCB'S. SPEND THE EXTRA DOE AND BUY A REAL, HEATED DE-SOLDERING TOOL WITH THE SUCKER BULB ATTACHED!"
5,One of the Best Reggae albums ever!,"This is a must-have for any roots reggae fan. Along with the four albums Steel Pulse released following this one (Tribute to the Martyrs, Caught You, True Democracy, & Earth Crisis), this is essential roots reggae. The stand-out tracks are ""Soldiers"", ""Sound Check"", and ""Prodigal Son"". The songs of this album contain socially conscious and politically- and racially-charged lyrics. David Hinds' vocals (with call-and-response backing vocals by the band) are incredibly soulful, and the rhythms are tight."
2,For reggae purists only,"This isn't the same kind of music as True Democracy, Earth Crisis, and Babylon the Bandit; it doesn't have the same catchy rhythms. To me it sounds like a completely different band. If you like the ""disco reggae"" aspect of Steel Pulse, then don't buy this one. Cheers."
4,"Scary, but possible","Young Neil Miller is orphaned following a car accident of which he is the sole survivour. He goes to live with his grandparents and whilst there, civilisation is almost entirely wiped out by a plaguee of pregoria. This is a disease which causes premature ageing in younger people. Neil must learn to survive alone and meets two girls in London and the fact that 'three is a crowd' makes for an interesting conclusion..."
5,You'll read it over and over again!,"I had read many of Christophers books before and found Empty World after looking through the library under Christphers name. It is the best book that I have ever read. In amost ten years of further reading I have not found a book so deep, moving and realistic that has captured my imagination and sent my mind reeling. I have read Empty World about 15 times now and it is still as gripping as the first time."
5,Recommended,"Very enjoyable, engrossing, quick read. Perhaps the only criticism I can think of is that it was too short... I didn't want it to end yet. Even at that, it was a complete story that didn't feel rushed. I certainly didn't mind that it was written for a young adult audience... and perhaps the only recognizable indication that it was written for that audience is the length of the novel. Both the characters and the whole story felt very well developed. Highly recommended for fans of the PA genre."
3,A bit of History,Not one of my favorite renditions of this age old story regarding the life of David - and there have been many - but it is still a good mini series for its day and if you are in to the Biblical Classics then still worth a look.
5,Take a Look at the ART!,Brian T. Jones has made Mr. Dunsuir's very amusing tale of life on a not-so-usual farm come to life. Every page is filled with lively and comical characters...and kids will have a blast discovering extra wacky goings-on on every page. Mr. Jones and Mr. Dunsmuir share a view of life and humor. Sweet and tangy with a twist. Good fun...good art!
5,NOTHING REALLY MATTERS,"WELL I THINK SHE IS THE BEST AND EVERY SONG SHE HAS MADE ARE THE BEST I AM A REALLY BIG FAN OF HER MY BEST SONG OF HERS IS MATERL GIRL IT ABSOUTLY FANTASTIC AND RAY OF LIGHT,POWER OF GOOD BYE"
3,You get what you're paying for.,"As a non 'fan', I found this quite interesting, as much so as Frozen, if not in more depth. It's a shame the second track on the CD is so mentally painful to hear, make sure you play only the track that you order!!"
5,"""The Power of Goodbye""","I must admit when ""Ray of Light"" came out in 1998, I was less than thrilled, having grown up with the Madonna from ""Vogue"" and ""Take A Bow"". However, the third single ""The Power of Goodbye"", changed my mind and forced me to take another look at the album. Madonna sings beautifully and gives the songs a haunting quality. ""The Power of Goodbye"" is one of my favorite Madonna songs, talking about the pain of saying goodbye and letting go. The music and lyrics are beautiful, and the video was another inspired piece of art from Madonna. The B Side, ""Mer Girl"", is a haunting song from the same album that once again deals with the death of Madonna's mother. If you are as touched by ""The Power of Goodbye"" as I am, you should buy this single today and put it on repeat..."
3,This album is half excellant half lame.,"The song ""The Power of Good-bye is excellent. The 2 track though is not very good in my opinion, but the first track is worth it."
1,Not really great at all!,"I have heard this CD for a few times only, it's really a bad and awful one."
5,Hard to find,I bought this for my son. He loves soccer and wanted a poster we could not find one anywhere. This is a really cool graphic with bright colors and a good message. Really nice on his wall.
5,cool poster,my son who plays soccer wanted to change his room. This poster is really cool and adds to his room.
5,This textbook was an eye opener,"I read this textbook for a Sociology class (Racial and ethnic relations)I had to take for my Bachelor of Social Work. I must say that what I learned from this text was an eye opening experience for me. It presented culture in such a way that you could almost feel the emotions within the pages you were reading.One of the more interesting and informative textbooks I studied during my coursework.Celia Barley Joyce,BSW"
5,It's the future of bubbly techno-bubble gum!!!,"AQUA is interesting in that they give a flavorful updated version of Ace of Base! Don't listen to Ace of Base to judge AQUA because it won't give the full response to their music. Another thing interesting about AQUA is their choice of semi-words. They have a variety of words used to liven up their songs, for example, dum di da di da or ayippie I E ayou ayippie I ay or even, a di da did mud!!! I strongly reccomend this album because if you don't have at least one in each household it's like never being able to understand the word color!!!"
3,"ITS PRETTY BABYISH, but some songs are good","I think that some songs like barby girl and my oh my are annoying and arn't good music. Regardless, I still like some of the songs because their jumpy and exciting. I hate all the songs on the second side of the cd except for turn back time. The rest are too dull."
3,It's a pretty good cd,"I am 8 yrs old and I think it is pretty good. My favorite song is ""Barbie Girl "". The music is fun!!!"
4,love it but.....pretty sure i'm gonna hate it soon...,"after just enough listens to it. I love it very much right now, aqua's ""aquarium"" is pretty much a good album to dance to, my favorite songs on the album are, ""barbie girl"", ""roses are red"", ""lollipop(candyman)"", pretty much all of them! i also enjoy aqua's ""aquarius"", mostly everyday i listen to it because it's absolutely catchy. And if you like any of these songs on this album, then you should enjoy them while ya can!I'm a barbie girl, in the barbie world!"
4,the good album,hi i think that this cd is the balm . if you look closely at barbie girl its not the most positive message but it has a great beat
3,One hit wonder,"Aqua falls short of the pop hit ""Barbie Girl"" on this album. Although it has a few songs that are enjoyable to listen to, it is a tchno sound that is all too familiar. I view it as a hyped up version of the early nineties band ""Real McCoy,"" but not near as good. If you can buy it cheap, go for it, but the content just isn't worth a large amount of money."
1,They don't know what their music really is!,"""Turn back time"" is way too different compare to other songs....it's the only song still worth to be called as a song... Other songs are things people don't need to listen to...no substance...kiddy..and immature... C'mon....barbie girl???.....dr.jones??... those are things elementary-school kids sing when they're playing in the afternoon.... Aqua should produce more meaningful songs such ""turn back time""..."
1,This is the worst record i've ever heard,"The critics reviews were right on target. This album is simply awful. I've heard tighter and more substantial melodies on ""Barney"" (not that I watch ""Barney""). Aqua's music is as refreshing as a saturday morning commercial, and the lyrics will leave you wishing you could blast Yoko Ono at full volume on a shoddy stereo, just to drown them out. This album is indeed shameless, with the female vocals that could shatter glass, ballads probably thrown out by Madonna in her earlier more annoying years, and male rap vocals that will leave you with a deer-in-the-headlights vacant gaze. On the other hand, i've already listened to Aqua's ""Aquarium"" at least 10 times. I am indeed ill."
1,Boring and stupid,The full album is silly and boring. Only Turn Back Time is worth listening but never try to listen Barbie Girl or Dr.Jones or that kind of staff...
1,ONE HOUR NONE STOP OF THE SAME BEAT AND SOUND,"Pop music at its worst, listen to the album one single time and you have already had enough of it for the rest the rest of your life"
4,Cool,"Aquarium belongs in a genre of music called ""bubblegum pop."" Why it is called that, I have no frickin' clue but it sounds cool to me. It's very similar to techno-pop and other related genres, but in any event, I like it a lot. The music is similar to the happy-go-lucky techno pop of Erasure's ""I Say I Say I Say."" The songs are very well developed and the hooks in about every track are great.The album starts solid right off the bat with my favorite song, ""Happy Boys and Girls,"" which is extremely optimistic, catchy and dancy. Deservingly it's received a lot of radio time. My 2nd favorite is ""My Oh My."" The so-called best hit, ""Barbie Girl,"" is only my 3rd or 4th favorite. With the exception of one or two songs the entire album is great.Aqua -a Danish group- is indicative of a trend of talented bands emerging from Scandinavia and gives some much needed competition to the U.S.A. and England who solely have dominated popular music since its origins."
4,Upbeat,"This whole CD is very upbeat and poppy. It is great for dancing or working out. There is a lot of sexual themes (what music doesn't have that anymore), but there are very obvious, so I wouldn't recommend it for someone under 13-14 years old...just my opinion.Barbie Girl...the song that got a lot of radio play in my area. After a while, I didn't like listening to this song, so I decided to explore the rest of the CD.Be A Man...""for once in your life, be a man."" How many times have you hear that?Lollipop...this is one of my favorite songs on the album. It is just really upbeat.This is a great album to have for a disco party of the new millenium."
4,Fun and Upbeat,"I like this album because it is just fun and happy. It makes me feel like dancing. It doesn't have a lot of feeling or depth, but it's great for days when you just need to be cheered up."
4,CD purchase,"Easy selection, hassle free purchase, international delivery faster than local one. Will continue to buy this way."
4,Bubblegum teen pop!,"I don't know why, but I love that stuff! It has great andesay-2 dance 2 dance beats! Barbiegirl and Lollipop(Candyman) are my favorite. Everyone says that they hate it, but once they're alone, I bet they're singing it! Of course, most beats sound almost all the same, if you really listen. Still, !GREAT! mix!"
5,great cd,"this cd is a mixture of european techno and european pop music. the songs on here sound like they are made for little children, but you got to whatch out for those little sexy metaphores. the best song on this cd would half to be barbie girl. but this cd is whole lot better than theier new one. this cd sounds like something you would hear on a nintendo game, like slow happy hardcore music. well i guess that completes my review."
2,typical,"the only song that worth listening is just ""Turn Back Time"". The rest are completely boring and annoying. They pick some sample here and there and called it music???I only recommend ""Turn Back Time"" - different and meaningful.the rest are junk music"
3,Novelty CD,"Only one song on this CD became a hit: BARBIE GIRL. The song is a great satire on the Mattel doll that has been the object of criticism for decades. The other songs on the disc are kitschy and bubble gum pop. Nothing that really stands out. If you can find the BARBIE GIRL single, that should suffice."
2,Barbie Girl-Not just about toys,"The songs are okay, but they don't have good messages.For instance, Barbie Girl. Just listening to it for the first time, it sounds like a happy, fun song about dolls in their make-believe world. Upon closer examination, though, the words, ""Kiss me here, touch me there..."" and ""You can touch, you can play..."" don't seem to apply to a doll's world.By all the world's standards, this is a good band. But I really don't like the lyrics to almost all the songs. Sure, they've got great beats, but do you really want to be listening to all that sexual stuff over and over? If you want a good band without all the bad stuff thrown in, I recommend dcTalk or TobyMac."
5,VERY CATCHY!,"This CD is sooo diverse. Of course they do have some down right silly songs like ""Barbie Girl"" and ""Docter Jones"", but they are so catchy, you can't help but like 'em. There are also more serious songs like ""Turn Back Time"", ""Be A Man"", and ""Good Morning Sunshine"". It is an excellent CD for anyone who likes pop music, or is looking for something new and different. =)"
1,Is this supposed to be music?,"This is some of the worst eurodance i have ever heard, all the songs sound the same, and their stupid vocals just keep playing over and over and over inside your head, until it finally drives you to the edge where you cant take anylonger. So put on this cd, and strap a noose around your neck, this sux a fat d*@#too bad i wasnt able to give this cd 0 stars---- i would if i could, believe me!"
1,This album deserves -10 000 000 000 000 000 000 stars!!,Aqua is repulsive! Save yourselves don't let it take you over! If you are on my side of this arguement don't hesitate to email me !!
1,It was horrible :-(,Aqua is a terrrrible band.IT'S NOT EVEN MUSIC! But I have to admit it is fun to make fun of. I think this band needs music lessons and that one needs a haircut. THEY STINK!!!!!
5,Amazing,"When I first heard the song ""Barbie Girl"" I said to myself ""Oh god, what the hell is this?"" I completly hated Aqua from there. But after a while i looked at their cd online and listenin to samples and thought it sounded ok. The next day i went out and bought the cd and listened to the whole thing. I was amazed by how good it was. I love alll the lyrics, beats, and rythims.Aqua is a great band."
2,"""Aquarium"" may be shallow for some","If you like heavy dance beats, cheesy synth sounds, and nonsense lyrics, pick this one up! ""Aquarium"" by the Dutch band Aqua is catchy the first time you hear it but after a few plays, it gets old, quickly. The overplayed track ""Barbie Girl"" got plenty of attention and every other track is similar. For youthful listeners, it's a must, but for adults, it's pointless."
4,"Fun to listen to, but not constantly!","I first got the CD because my friend thought it was cool, but I like the songs on it now too. My favorite is ""Doctor Jones"". I only listen to it when I feel like being up-beat. If I listen to it too much I get tired of it. A good CD, but not one you would want to listen to all the time."
4,"A fun CD, although too much 'Barbie' can really get to you!","I, like many others, bought the CD because I thought Barbie Girl was a cool song (with a cool message, too!). Now, to be honest, I'm kinda sick of Barbie Girl, but I discovered other gems in the CD- my favourite being Lollipop. All in all, a good CD for those days when you want to act kinda crazy and dance around a bit! Have fun!"
2,Teenage garbage,"Aqua have conquered the world with their music, if the noise diserves to be called music. I cannot see why the youths like it, cause it is IRRITATING music. It is the sort of music that can drive you crazy. The first time you hear them they can be OK, but the second time you wanna run and hide."
2,Europop music at its best,"Okay, the singles were quite amusing to hear a couple of times, but hear the album once and (if you are acquainted with good music and the english language) and you won't want to hear it again. There is more 'enjoyable' music than this. Lene's voice could break the windows if anyone bothers playing this full volume. Recommended for younger listeners, perhaps."
2,Good for dances...Bad for every-day listening,"I bought this CD originally because I knew a lot of other people who owned it. It was a complete waste of money. The only people who I'd recommend it to are DJ's. All the songs sound the same and have the same rhythm. I do have to admit, the CD makes a good frisbee, and the case doesn't do too poorly as a coaster!"
5,"Catchy, great, fun and terrific. A brilliant CD for all ages","All of the songs on Aqua are so catchy. Usually only a few songs on albums are good, but all are excellent on Aqua. Every track is really fun and great to dance to. Aqua are my favourite band in the world. Buy the CD!!"
5,The Greatest Album of All Time!!!,"I originally purchased this album just to get ""Barbie Girl."" But amazingly, I ended up absolutely loving the entire album. The music is very upbeat, energetic, and extremely slick! I know that many people critisize this band, and I have had many friends tease me about the fact that I love Aqua so much and that they are my favorite band, but I really don't care. My favorite songs on the album are Be Happy, My Oh My, Barbie Girl (of course! :-), Dr. Jones, Candyman, and my very favorite, the last song on the album, Calling You. Although the lyrics to ""Calling You"" are kind of lame and childish, the music and the digital instrumentation are absolutely mindblowing! I usually play this song back at least twice whenever I get to this track! To this day, I still love Aquarium and blast it in my car whenever I play it! It will continue to be my favorite album for quite some time, I'm sure!"
4,Every song is my favorite!,"This is one of my very favorite CDs! I listen to it all of the time and every single song on the CD, I luv. The thing I luv about the CD the most is the voice of the woman who sings it. She has the highest, brassiest voice, and I luv it!!!! The only real prob with the CD is all the songs sound pretty much the same except for the lyrics. If you want a fun CD this is the one!"
3,"Oh, come on.","I cannot think of one person I know who has not had the ""Barbie Girl"" tune stuck in their head.The entire album is like that. All of the songs have about 4 lines, which are sung over and over again, with club beats that sound almost the same on every track. Lene's voice is the perfect compliment to the music, annoying at times but catchy. This album is just stupid fun.Try not to read too deep into the lyrics. It seems one song in particular, Lollipop Candyman, is one steaming sexual metaphor (""If you show me to the sugar tree, will you give me soda pop for free?"") that will send parents screaming.Quality is not an issue here. It is just a cheeky effort from a one-hit wonder Danish band."
1,Perverted,The lyrics to this cd are disgusting and deserve nothing more then to be thrown in the garbage.This beat may be up but the lyrics deserve to be down. Down in the garbage disposal. I wish it were possible to give it less than one star. If you REALLY want music listen to Ace of Base!
5,If you liked Barbie Girl you'll love the whole album,"This album shows you that bands like Aqua are not to be put in one case. They can do much more than one style. On this CD there are some songs which are different from Barbie Girl and My Oh My! But if you liked Barbie Girl, you'll love the whole album!"
1,Le commentaire de OUI OUI,"Cet album, et plus généralement ce type de musique, est révélateur de la déchéance à laquelle peut amener l'industrialisation de la musique. Sous des mélodies fades et ennuyeuses, AQUA nous fait découvrir à quel point peut aller l' exploitation abusive de recettes de cuisines pour produire de la musique. Je trouve donc d'utilité publique de ne pas acheter cet album, qui devrait d'ailleurs etre censuré pour le plus grand bien de tous."
4,Aqua--a return to music that's plain fun?,"Aqua is cool. They're cool because they obviously have such fun with their music. No, they don't have huge statements about the poverty of the world or the status of the environment; ""Barbie Girl"" is probably the closest thing to a 'statement' they make. They simply create songs that have a lively beat and are fun to listen to. The kicky pop beats in songs such as ""Lollipop"", ""Happy Boys & Girls"", and ""Doctor Jones"" may be a little too much for some listeners, though.""Turn Back Time"" (a slower, more mellow song) should have been placed in the middle to give a break. But, heck, I listened to 'Aquarium' and think it's great. Give it a try...it's a welcome departure from the rantings of those musicians who are all p.o.'d with the world and shriek about it constantly."
5,Aqua pure gold,"Aquarium might sadly be a one-hit wonder for Aqua, but what a hit it is! It has a variety of good music, although I must say it is great for getting started into the dance-electronica scene. Lene's beautiful voice and Rene Dif's deep interjections really contribute a lot to their songs. If you pick your ear up, you can also hear a nice blend of sounds that make their music complex, or polyphonic. A lot of music of this genre falls into the trap of simplicity wrapped around a repeating drum loop, but not Aqua! Even their slow stuff is good. Very upbeat, happy, and cheerful."
3,"Ethereal Singing, but great lyrics and backgrounds","The singing of the girl at least (applied in most tracks), seems a bit ethereal. She might have morphed her voice a little, just like Eiffel 65. Not that that really matters. The songs are Europop and have a dance and pulse feel on most songs. These songs were written in 1996 and 1997 (from what I know from editorial reviews). Barbie Girl was their most well known, and most famous hit, but others like My, Oh My and Roses are red were also on the top 10 charts. This is a mingled combination of Ace of Base and Eiffel 65 (in my opinion). Roses are red has this incredible Ace of Base Background like on the Ace Hits the Sign, Don't Turn Around, and All that she wants. On the one ballad song, she has great singing. The lyrics are also unique and hysterical."
4,Perfect for my new kitchen!,"This is the perfect under-cabinet mount because the cords hide away and it's a slim design. Maybe it's just our tv, but I do have a hard time making it stay fully up when I'm trying to put it up. The weight of the tv makes the mount come back down a little but it's still up enough for me to have the counter space I wanted. Otherwise, we love it!"
4,The Westernizing of an Irish Lad,"L'Amour takes a raw lad from Ireland ans sends him west for a railway laboring job. Having missed reboarding the train in the middle of nowhere, he winds up teaching himself to use guns for self protection from renegades and effectively rescues the big brass ans saves the heroine. Fine action & narration. Try Aymond by Burkhart, also here at Amazon, for similar action by a young lad in the West, now that L'Amour is no longer with us."
2,programmer_in_santamonica,This book should not carry the word Professional in the title - it is basic - very basic at best. This book is all about the Intel architecture - e.g. Intel processors. The target audience for this book - as stated in the introduction - is C/C++ programmers interested in converting their (Linux) C/C++ programs to assembly language. Consider this book if you know nothing of assembly language and you want to play around with it in a Linux on Intel hardware environment. Do not buy this book if you are interested in writing anything more advanced than simple hello world real mode apps. More specifically - do not buy this book if your are interested in writing IA-32 protected mode code - none of those things are covered in the book.
5,Balanced in any way,"User level: IntermediateIt's AT&T; style, Linux, Intel based.He is an expert in explaining. Well organized Buy it and give it a start.I'am reading it now for the second time. Absolutely Recommended."
5,Solid walkthrough of x86 assembler,"I do find it odd that in this day and age we are still talking about introductory assembler. But that being said, if you need it you need it, and this is a great place to to get an introduction to the x86 instruction set on the latest processors. Connections with Linux are also demonstrated. Graphics and illustrations are well used but not overused. The text is well written and engaging."
5,"Hip, Smart , Funny","If you enjoy finely crafted prose, need a dose of hilarity, and aren't easily offended, then you'll enjoy this. The stories are based (loosely?) on the author's sexual misadventures. Keck sometimes seems incredulous recounting his own behavior and the responses it elicits in others. Well worth your dime and your time."
4,Ladies Love Outlaws,"I once had a roommate who often played a song with the lyrics, ""Ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs."" This movie sets out to prove that point when a spirited woman, Sarah Miles, fleeing her husband gets kidnapped by a band of outlaws led by Burt Reynolds. Romance on the Range soon ensues. As westerns go, it's pretty enjoyable."
1,Bad CD,When the product was received it was found to be damaged. Only half of the cd was readable. Went blank at the halfway mark.Was not what I expected.
5,This album rocks!,"There are some terrific songs on this disc, and it gives you a taste of various artists. Someone apparently ""borrowed"" this CD from me because my case is empty, so now I have to replace it. I miss singing along w/ my favorite song on this disc, ""Las Piedras Rodantes"", by El Tri. Sometimes I get chills from the song ""Flaca"".Este album esta super-padre! Lo recomiendo para aficionados de rock...tiene un poco de todo."
3,I hope it will work,"I hope it will work, don't know yet! The smell is not amount my favorites, but it doesn't get absorbed well."
2,Not a fan.,Didn't like this product at all. There are much better ones out there. It feels oily and doesn't absorb well.
1,Sleepy Hollow 5 - Blu ray Version 0,"Love the movie...I thought my player was busted and had to try other Blu rays to make sure. I feel I got ripped off, my DVD version looks better.bah"
4,"Imaginative and beautiful, but lacking in story.","I love the idea of the headless horseman, and this movie gives it a so-so treatment. The filming is beautifully gothic - and definitely Burtinesque, but is not as good as some of his others.Maybe I'm stuck on the Disney cartoon version, but I would have rather seen a bumbling Ichabod than Johnny Depp's scientific policeman approach. He did OK, and so did Christina Ricci.There is little violence (that you see on camera) but I still wouldn't show this movie to anyone under 7 years old..."
2,Where is the Plot?,"This movie did nothing for me. It moves along slowly, has some very stiff acting and a hard to follow plot.If u want to check out Johnny Depp's better work then get ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"", (also Leonardo DiCaprio's finest work.) Christina Ricci does some bad acting here, but i think the script stinks. The film is also unnessessarily gory, it seems like the gore is suposed to make up for the lack of storyline. I was bored."
4,An American Folklore Classic........,"Tim Burton did a fantastic version of Sleepy Hollow. The dreary and dark landscapes, odd characters, and the special effects were classic Tim Burton. The decapitation scenes were at times grusome. The true star of the movie was the Headless Horsemen and his horse. I enjoyed the segment on the DVD how the movie was developed and the special effects used in the movie. I would recommend this movie."
5,The Best Film of 1999 - No Kidding.,"I love this movie, it is totally the best film of 1999. The most stylish and best horror in a long time. You'll love it.Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp - marvellous in this one) has just been sent to discover the Headless Horseman in a town called Sleepy Hollow. The Horseman is continously decapitating residents of the small town, and Crane does not yet know he is next in line.You'll scream, you'll laugh - this movie has it all! Should of won over American Beauty at the Oscars...."
4,A Horror Classic That Was Done Justice,"I've loved the story of the headless horseman since I first read the story as a little kid. I was hoping when the movie came out, it would be as good as the story I remembered. I wasn't disappointed. The movie is very good and I recommend it highly. For all of the kids out there that have never heard of the story of the headless horseman, watch this movie and I'll be willing to bet that you'll be captivated by the story also as so many others of us have been."
4,Spooky and Amazing,"The classic tale of the Headless Horseman, brought to life by Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is so believable as Icabod Crane. And Christopher Walken is the perfect choice for the Headless Horseman. The plot and story will definately keep you on the edge of your seat. Also amazing was the scenery. I kept trying to figure out if it was a built set, or special effects, or a combination. Burton has made the tale of the Headless Horseman even more frightening than you can imagine."
4,Suspenseful and gory,"Usually i don't like too much gore in a movie (or in our country =P) But this movie really did catch my eye. It had many twists and turns and it really catches you in the end. I enjoyed Johnny Depp, who seems to have blossomed since 21Jumpstreet. Christina Ricci's fake accent did bother me though. All in all I loved this movie, come on Christopher Walken as a bad guy, who'da thunk it. Good movie, very suspenseful and worth the price. you'll like it for years."
3,For My Brother,"I am afraid I did not get to see this movie, it was for my brother and he enjoyed it, so I guess it is a good movie but what ever I purchase from Amazon I have been very satisfied and even with the amount of time it is shipped to my home, thank you."
2,"Wonderful movie, so-so Blu-ray","Blu-ray holds such promise, and this disc fails to deliver on it. Granted it was one of the earliest titles, but as mentioned it is grainy, and the colors don't exactly pop and sometimes it seems darker than it is probably supposed to be. I did not do a direct comparison with the DVD which I used to own, and while overall it is probably better looking due to increased details, i.e. you really see people's lines in their faces, etc., I'd suggest waiting until the re-do this and do it right unless you just must have it. Sounds good, but doesn't have the latest in audio either, such as an uncompressed track. It's also a 25GB, which is pointless when all Blu-rays with content of this length should be 50GB."
5,Sleepy Hollow,"WOW! what else can I say? Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. This is a fun movie to watch and, at times, pretty scarey. Johnny Depp is a very skillful actor and he handles his role with professionalism. This movie is under $10.00 and weel worth the price . So, grab you're sweetie, some popcorn and enjoy. Best, John R. Tracy."
4,Great Halloween movie,I really enjoy watching this spin of the classic story around Halloween. One of my favorite Tim Burton movies. I would also recommend The nightmare Before Christmas also directed by Burton.
4,better than the average horror movie,"I'm not a huge fan of horror movies so perhaps it helped that I watched this at 1 am in the middle of the woods at a camp like area. With the average teeny horror flicks, I can tell who the killer is immediately but I must say, I was quite baffled over who was controlling the headless horseman. I was pleased by the plot being so convincing. Overall, definitely a movie to see, it will make the hairs on your back stand up if you watch it online or at night in the woods like I did."
5,i loved it!!,"I thought this movie was great. The graphics were terrific, storyline followed the book, and not to mention Johnny Depp & Christina Ricci were in the starring roles makes this film splendid."
3,Just ok.,"The transfer to HD DVD on this is just ok. My advice would be to buy the regular dvd. I know that its the way it was shot its suppose to look grainy. But when it comes to HD its just not worth it for Grainy movies unless you just buy it for the sound.Best bet, Go find the dvd for 4.99"
5,dark yet funny,"Johnny Depp's is hilarious as the scared hero and the story is dark enough to pass as somewhat horror. Christina Ricci was excellent too, who happens to be way more brave the Depp's character. Very entertaining movie, dark humor worked really well"
5,a masterpiece,tim burton and my fav director francis ford copola teamed up to do thier version of the legend of sleepy hollow and its stunning from the tim burton settings to coppolas mastery of slowlymoving credits and building of suspense through music this films a great movie to watch on an october night and johny depp and christini ricci both do wonderful acting jobs look for christopher lee as the judge in the beggining this is the first johny depp film i truly liked
4,Good departure from the original,"This is very far from the original by Washington Irving, so far that it is really a completely different work of art. While in the original Icobod, is a kind of local twit of a teacher - pompous, lacking self awareness, ridiculously awkward - in this he is a big city ""scientific"" investigator who comes to the provincial town. Moreover, Irving's tale never quite enters the supernatural, but instead is a parody that leaves much to the imagination.That being said, Depp creates a very good character: a bit of a dork, but courageous in overcoming his fear. THe atmosphere is as vivid and dense as one would expect from Burton, with excellent actors adding to it. It is more of a traditional horror story that is tied off rather than left open, which I regretted.Recommended for fans."
2,Here's One to Skip,"How could a movie crew this talented mess up this badly? Christina Ricci (Mermaids, Adams Family), Johnny Depp (What's Eating Gilbert Grape?), director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman), a well casted array of character actors, it should have been great. However, even these fine actors have trouble spitting out the unintentionally funny, wooden dialogue. The cinema-photography is wonderful, atmosphere very imaginatively done. Sadly, the pluses and minuses barely add up to the two star level."
1,Dull jelly-splasher,"This was a disappointing mess. The rewriting of a classic plot provided an excuse for exhaustingly repetitive beheadings with lots of fake blood flying, mystical gibberish and yet another one-note weirdo appearance by Christopher Walken. Fun for a few minutes, ultimately boring."
1,I saw it on HBO at my first view,"I thought it's pretty beautiful and very entertaining, and I enjoyed Depp's and everyone's performance. A few days later, I bought it and saw it in my room at the same night, I turned off the light...I made a big mistake. I was so relax until the 61 minutes, oh I almost cried...since growing into an adult this is the first time I was scared so much!!! It shorted the length of my life!!!"
1,Yawn...Made Me Sleepy,"This movie did absolutely nothing for me. I was extremely disappointed. As a matter of fact, I stopped watching after the first 20 minutes. It's for kids. Certainly, those under 19-20 years old may enjoy this movie, but it is NOT an adult spooky film. I had no idea that it was such a silly movie. I expected much more."
1,DVD-HD,"I did not realize that the category of HD-DVD required a specific HD player. The DVD would not work on any VCR or computer in 3 households. It never occurred to me that I was getting anything other than a DVD that was HD quality, rather a unique type such as Blue Ray. Consequently, I cannot comment on the quality of the product I received. The shipment time was as expected."
2,No idea what movie other people here saw,"This movie is really bad. Tim Burton is a lousy director and writer, but often brings some interesting visuals and ideas to a movie if he is controlled (usually by someone else writing the script).He has made some great stuff: Batman, Big Fish, Sweeney Todd (Nightmare before Christmas was not directed by him)He has made some awful stuff: Planet of the Apes, Batman Returns, and this movie.The movie is spared a one star because of some cool looking sets and a great (non-speaking) performance by Christopher Walken. Everything else in the movie (maybe I'm forgetting something, Johnny Depp was ok, but well below his usual level) is pure garbage. I would strongly recommend spending your DVD dollar elsewhere."
5,Johnny is so cute and this film is AWESOME!,"I loved it. Incabod Crane is actually supposed to be not-so-good looking man but thats hard to do when Johnny Depp is in that role. I loved it from start to finish and it's a great film to watch on cloudy days.....heck, evereyday. Buy it, I loved it!!! (Johnny is great as usual!)"
5,GREAT flick for Halloween!!,"If you love the Halloween holiday you will enjoy this movie.It is wonderfully filmed,spooky and unique."
5,COOL MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE HAS HAD SOME GREAT ACTING IN IT.I have seen some good movies in my time by Tim Burton. He is astonishing.Sleepy Hollow was not only good, but it had some real nice acting actors in it.This time, the heads looked unfake when they were beheaded.My recommendation:GO AND BUY IT AS SOON AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. REALLY! I just saw it last night and said,""You know, I think I may get this!"", it was so good. If I remember, this is the second movie that Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken were in by Tim Burton. {Mr.Walken-Batman Returns,Mr.Depp-Edward Scissorhands}.I AM NOT KIDDING, THIS IS COOL AND HAS SOME FAMILIAR ACTORS IN IT."
1,Should Only Be View By Those Without A Head!,"This film lived up to its name; Sleepy and Hollow. This is a movie for teenagers with bad taste. It's hard to believe anybody takes this film seriously. Yes, visually it was pleasing but the characters were one-dimensional and hyperbolic with few exceptions. The suspense was poorly paced.Yes, the cinematography and costumes were very nice but hardly a reason to endure the bordem."
3,Sleepy Hollow,"Killer movie, love the special appearance by Cristopher Walkin as the headless horseman. Makes the movie much better."
1,Excruciating,"The violence in this film is so excessively sadistic that parents should be forewarned before bringing it into their living rooms under the guise of some kind of updated legendary entertainment for the family. 'Sleepy Hollow' could be subtitled 'Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Beheadings (during and after).' Two examples: a whole happy family is beheaded, one by one, with each member seeing a loved one's severed head before being killed; and a man is impaled with a fence post before his daughter's eyes and dragged outside to get beheaded. Outside of that, 'Sleepy Hollow' is all atmosphere with a daffy storyline. As a friend's teenage daughter commented afterward, ""It wasn't even scary."" If this wasn't a mainstream film, one would think the deliberate, choreographed sadism is the product of sick minds. It's probably just a sign of the times."
4,NOT A SLEEPER,"This wonderful movie has then perfect cast and plot. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the main character, the scenes are beautiful and even the heads getting cut off are somewhat artistic. Tim Burton has perfect timing. The music by Danny Elfman goes perfectly with the dark scenery. The movie is about a man who is sentenced to go to Sleepy Hollow, where there is a mass-murderer without a head, who chops people's heads off and stores them in a tree. A must-see!Rated R (Gory, bloody violence, suspense)"
5,DEPP saves the day,"DEPP and Burton are a masterpiece made in heaven. Great Setting, story and plot. Its funny too."
3,eh,"Like most Tim Burton movies, this is a beautiful movie without much of a plot. The whole thing looks like a painting and I'm blown away by the visuals. I also dig the whole Johny Depp as Bride of Frankenstein look.Unfortunately the murder mystery falls apart at the end of the movie and the Headless Horseman which was evil and unstoppable, suddenly slows down in order to have a hokey chase scene with the main characters. Before then there is nice atmosphere and enough to hold one's interest but it's not the most original plot in the world."
5,Burton's Best,"Director Tim Burton has directed many a fantastical lyrical fantasy, among his best are ""Batman,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Vincent,"" and ""Mars Attacks!"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" however, outclasses these all in heart, pacing, character development (excluding Christina Ricci's passable but utterly forgettable female lead, that is), spirit, mood, and something called (in these days of overly-glossy melodrama like ""Star Wars Episode 1,"" ""Tarzan,"" and, sadly, ""The World is Not Enough""--Bond 19) movie magic. This is a film for the ages. Considering the critical and box office responses (netting over $200 million), expect a sequel to this heartfelt masterpiece!"
3,sleepy hollow,i was a little disappointed in the sound and picture for this blu-ray. i thought the picture and the sound could have been better.
4,Important information before buying!,"Sleepy Hollow has been my 2nd all time favorite move since its release. I have always wanted the DVD and finally purchased it a couple weeks ago. However, I just learned as of today that HD DVD's do not play in regular dvd players. All these years I have watched movies and I never knew this. Just wanted to give those who are interested in buying it a heads up! However, I did order a regular disc today so I will be able to enjoy it in a few days!!"
5,Sleepy Hollow,i saw the movie on cable but only the end part so i wanted to buy the movie and when i watched it it was geat i loved it Johnny Depp is a geat actor.
4,A Horror Thriller That Will Keep You At The Edge of Seat!!,Sleepy Hollow is a Horror/Love story about a Headless Horseman going around a town at night and cutting off other peoples heads. That's a masterpiece! Tim Burton has yet brought the world another great film. The story was well thought of and I loved the surprise ending(children under the age of 7 should not watch this GORY movie. It was great though).
4,"""Head"" of the Class","I have not seen so many heads being chopped off since the spanish inquisition. There were at least 5 heads rolling in the first 30 minutes of the movie. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie. I did however have trouble figuring out Depp's character in the movie. He was part Sherlock Holmes and part Perry Mason,mixed with a little Dana Scully for seasoning. First he wants to believe nothing without scientific proof, then he freaks out and all of a sudden he's a ghostbuster. Overlooking that part of the movie, I do recommend this movie for a great weekend flick. ""HEAD"" out and pick this one up."
5,Sleepy Hollow,"This picture is a great story about Ickabod Crain, The story was first told a Long time ago with an animated version from Disney, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Even tho, Christopher Walken was not given any credits in the movie, He played an important and very convencing role. Its a must see movie and Im gonna add this one to my collection of Classics. This movie gets 5 stars from me."
3,I laughed until I cried,"I originally saw this in the theatre- very beautiful to look at, but unfortunately, none too scary. Tim Burton's work is always lovely to look at and you will not be disappointed in his artistic vision. You need to see this in DVD if you had not seen it in a theatre. Be prepared to laugh though-think of me when you hear Depp shriek in horror about ""HE had NO HEAD!"" It had us rolling in the aisles. 3 stars for that scene alone."
5,A MUST SEE,This is an instant classic. A must see for anyone who is into a gothic type of movie. I also recomend the book.
4,A beheading good film,"Tim Burton has always been known as a director who goes the unusual route. (His first film after all was Pee Wee's Big Adventure.) But after doing the first two Batman films he began to mature and take on bigger and better projects. He has an extraordinary visual sense which shines through in ""Sleepy Hollow."" How this film lost the Best Cinematography award at the Oscar's I can't figure out. It is a beautiful to just look at. The Production Design is also terrific. The action sequences are staged wonderfully and are very suspenseful. What keeps this film from being excellent is the script. It gets slow and mundane at times and the dialogue seems a bit conceited. There are many decapitation scenes which the kids might want to stay away from. The acting is solid. Depp and Ricci are beleiveable in their roles and work well together on screen. The cast Burton put together for town is also quite good. Watch this movie in the dark and then beware of the Headless Horsemen."
5,Pleasantly Moody,"How could you not love this movie. The visuals are top notch and the music makes the whole thing flow. This is one of Tim Burton's best. Even though the movie isn't too frightening, that's not what i was expecting. Put this movie on late at night, turn up the surround sound and enjoy."
4,STYLISH,"Tim Burton never disappoints when it comes to visual power - he gets that spooky place in your heart and mind precisely the way you want it. Though major - and sometimes crazy - liberties are taken with the original legend, this movie surely delivers a rush of spooky delights, and Johnny Depp, in a mannered and winning performances, is delightful. The charging horses through the fog of an impossibly scary/beautiful forest make your heart pound, though the movie is not as memorable as some other Burton creations (Nightmare/Christmas; Edward Scissorhands). Definitely not for the faint of heart, and certainly not for the youngsters -- the gore is in your face; and given the storyline, there are many, many beheadings, all done with the amplified sound effects of a sharp blade slashing through the base of one's skull."
5,"Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, Johnny Depp --Killer combo","Hard to deny a film with Tim Burton because if you love his work, you love the casts he employs. Usually pulls in old favorites with a few new ones to freshen it up. This is a classic Tim Burton film."
5,Tim Burton's Best,"This movie is a work of art. The Oscar-winning production designer had an extrordinary visual imagination. The whole film is like a hughe painting in dark tones.Tim Burton brings it to life.Combining scary moments, a romantic lovestory and comical elements this is a MUST see movie.Johnny Depp plays Ichabod with such a delicious irony it is a real pleasure to watch him solving the ""crimes"" in Sleepy Hollow, where a headless horseman is chopping off heads.Christina Ricci plays Katrina VanTassel like a hoplessly romantic from a fairy tale.Danny Elfman's dark score with a lot of choir-parts adds too the mood of this beautiful film.People get killed in this movie yeah, but all you can say after the movie is: This was beautiful!Something that only Tim Burton can achieve."
3,A Good film,This movie was a lot better then I though it gonna be. The death scenes are good but it was too short and slow sometimes. Still a good film and Johnny is always good.
3,Dark Imagery,"For all that it's worth, Burton did a nice job with presentation of Sleepy Hollow. Perhaps the plot and dialogue could have been better if it didn't seem as if it was being forced,"
3,FANTASTIC ELEMENTS,"Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci ride on... Sleepy Hollow is a spooky adaptation of the story of Sleepy Hollow and the headless horseman. Depp plays the skeptical city police inspector who comes to the small town of Sleepy Hollow only to be bewitched by the young Christina Ricci and to fall prey to the spells and superstitions of the town. Positively horrifying is Christopher Walken (you watch it and you will know what I am talking about. The guy is scary when you see him looking normally; this is just abuse for the eyes!) The story is well-told, acting is good, and the cinematography and scenery evokes the kind of imagery that is necessary for this to be believable. Overall a fantastic film (in the sense that it is successful in the realm of fantasy)."
4,"Wasn't expecting it to stay true to what it was, but it did","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*This movie surprised me in that it was a ghost story which remained a ghost story all the way through. Usually when you get a movie like this it turns into a sort of Scooby Doo movie and the killer turns out to be old man Jenkins, however in Sleepy Hollow the headless horseman is a ghost, and stays a ghost. The movie rides the tale out quite well while Tim Burton takes his own spins of certain plot points they are often for the better. A solid film with decent proformances, it gave me more than I expected."
4,Atmosphere,"This movie really was all about the atmosphere, and who better to do it than the master of the dark and creepy, Tim Burton. As expected, Tim Burton lavishes us with his famous eye candy that rivals the quality of Batman. The plot was good. It followed the classic tale well without being predicatble or cliche. Eventhough most know the story of Sleepy Hallow by heart, he left me wondering what was happening in this movie. Acting was a cut above average. Johnny Depp was supurb in his role, and the rest of the cast was believeable and well displayed. The characters themselves were well done, but nothing exceptional. The screenplay was good. I don't remember any exceptionally good parts or obvious holes. All in all a good movie, but if a strong emphasis on setting/atmosphere really isn't your thing, then this movie might not be for you."
4,Beautiful But Bloody,"This movie is gorgeous to watch if you don't mind a little blood. The costumes, sets and special effects are amazing. This is a must-have movie for Johnny Depp fans to add to their collection. Curl up cozy on the couch and be transported!"
4,"Fun ""period"" horror!","A refreshing interpretation of the Sleepy Hollow legend. Featuring humor, good special effects, and a great feel for the period portrayed.Highly recommended."
3,hmm.,"It is a slightly slow moving film and I didn't find it overly interesting.However, I loved Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane. He captured the man perfectly, and for that I'd say see the movie.I did like this movie. It's not my favorite, and I probably wouldn't see it again. But it was good enough not to bore me, thanks to mister Depp."
5,Question...,"5 stars for the movie, but I'm lost on the details for this DVD. Does anybody know what is different about this DVD? Is it a special edition or just a re-release?"
3,tim burtons take on washington irving loses its sizzle as it goes along,"while i thoroughly enjoyed the opening hour of this tim burton / johnny depp collaboration, it loses all its energy in its secind half. as always, its visually interesting but the plotline falls back upon the revenge destroys cliche. it will be interesting to see just what this director & frequent muse wreak upon their upcoming project, the ULTIMATE revenge meditation: sondheims ""sweeney todd""."
3,Another Burton Short Story Movie,"I own a few of Burton's films, and it's obvious he has no clear vision regarding the scope of his projects. Edward Scissor Hands, Sleepy Hollow, his version of Planet Of The Apes, The Corpse Bride, Beetle Juice are all basically small concepts forcibly stretched out into attempts at full movie scripts. So far the only film a value in a critical sense by him is Sweeney Todd... and that subject is basically hack material by now. I feel this is like most Burton movies, a little bit of his quirky style and not much else... no stand out acting, boring redundant Elfman soundtrack boys choir and all... ""ooooo~ewwwww~oooooo~ahhhhhhh~haaaaaa~haaaaaa~oooooo""I doubt Burton has the capacity to conceive of anything of true substance having made countless films all revolving around cheap fluff material."
3,Headless Horseman Undone By Brainless Script,"There is so much right about ""Sleepy Hollow"" that it's unfortunate it goes awry. Terrific Hammer style cinematography. Jaw dropping Oscar winning art direction. Rousing Danny Elfman score. Expectably fine work by Johnny Depp as the bumbling Ichabod Crane. Terrifying turn by Christopher Walken as the Headless Hessian. Too bad all of this is in the service of a byzantine script that practically undoes all that's good about the film. The plot that engulfs this film is so maddeningly confusing you want to throw something at the screen. I hate movies where the writers think they are smarter than the audience. Director Tim Burton stages some interesting set pieces and at times there are some genuinely scary moments. Not enough, however, to save this film from the mundane."
4,Good Movie,"If you can wade through Icabod's dreams about his mom, it is really a very good movie. A good mix of Police Files meets Night Gallery (sorry you young ones can't relate). Not overly graphic in terms of todays slasher flicks. A good spooky movie."
2,What a mess,"This film starts off well purely due to the fact that the acting is hilarious (I suspect intentionally). As the film tries to develop however, it quickly descends into what seems like an episode of scooby-doo. I was genuinely surprised at the end when I realised that the janitor actually didn't do it. To be fair, the film was entertaining at times, and I'm sure a lot of people will love it, but I walked away wondering exactly what it was trying to achieve. I think this movie is good for those people who want to feel scared, but don't have the stomach for a real horror movie. Overall: hit and miss."
1,Washington Irving is rolling over in his grave.,"I took great exception to the fact that this movie borrowed the name and a few (FEW) plot elements from its namesake short story. Why bother if you're simply going to make such a radical departure from the letter and the spirit of the original?I generally like both Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci (not to mention Tim Burton), but even they were not enough to raise this messy adaptation from the bowels of derivative shamelessness."
4,watch your head!,This is a very scary movie it will knock your head off Icahbob is a dectectivve solving a case about peoples heads being cut off by the headless horseman by the movie to find out the rest.
3,Where's the story??,"I rented this movie a few days ago, not expecting wonders, only a good job from Depp who never fails to deliver, and perhaps some interesting environments created by Burton. What I got was absolute confusion. All of the characters that looked and acted similar where always in a scene together, and then later the viewer was supposed to be clear on every intricate plot detail.And what was with all of the side plots that were basically insignificant to the overall story? Crane's mother... how does that fit in?The twist at the end shocked me. Not because it was so brilliant or well thought out, but because the character was not developed AT ALL. I barely knew who they were, then all of a sudden they are the star of the show. Whaaa? Did I fall asleep for an hour? No, but I did wake up to a beautifully haunting but very confusing story."
2,Am I the Only Person Disappointed by this Movie?,"I liked EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and ED WOOD, both Tim Burton films starring Johnny Depp, and I suppose I was expecting something like that from this one. While it's visually interesting, like most of Burton's movies, and while Depp manages to amuse in a few places, on the whole this seemed like a very by-the-numbers horror/slasher film. Maybe a little more stylish than most, but nowhere near as eclectic and clever as Burton's other films. The scene with the cache of heads in the tree was all right, the scene with the little kid hiding under the floorboards was OK, the early fight scene with the still-capitated horseman was pretty good; but most of the movie threatened to put me to sleep. It's not a big deal that the story has little to do with Washington Irving or even the Disney cartoon, but you'd think the creators could have come up with something a little more original than a ""Friday the 13th: Jason Visits The 19th Century"" type story."
3,Soundtrack way too loud,The movie was exciting but the soundtrack was so loud one could barely hear the dialog. The more I turned it up to hear what was being said....of course you know the end of that sentence. I must say I was dissapointed.
3,what is this,"Given the talent, it was disappointing that this movie could not decide if it was scary or comedic -- so it turned out to be neither..."
5,Movies,I love this movie! It's perfectly done for the dark and dreary world of Sleepy Hollow and Johnny Depp did a great job.
4,Great Halloween movie.,My wife loves this movie and never sees it on network television. It was a gift for her for Christmas. She can watch it anytime she wants now.
4,An Interesting Take on Ichabod Crane,"I am a Captain Jack Sparrow fan, so I thought that translated to being a Johnny Depp fan. After purchasing most of his movies, I found out It really doesn't. He's an excellent actor, but I must say some of the movies (not necessarily the characters) leave me cold. This one is one of his more interesting characterizations. This is one that I can actually watch over."
1,Dont Buy Sleepy Hollow Blu-Ray--Poor Resolution,"Simply put, my Sleepy Hollow DVD looks better than the Blu-Ray version I purchased. Very grainy and poor res. Playing on PS# with Samsung 52"" LCD 1080p."
4,GORY GORY GORY BUT FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY,"Awesome. This movie is the best depiction of this urban legend (THE HEADLESS HORSEMEN). You might want to leave the kids in another room and keep a bowl by the couch but other than blood and gore this movie has potential. it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo funny it deservs to be bought for that reason alone, and if you love comic books you will definently love this movie, it is like watching the pages turn. buy it today."
4,take the bad with the good,"Let me just start with the few negative things about this movie that I have to mention: It's a little too long (fifteen minutes less would have been perfect), and it's a little heavy on the demonic side. If you don't have a strong stomach, the violence will be intollerably gruesome. Now, the positivity: This film is classic and beautiful. It's a dark and mysterious horror film that's rich with atmosphere and imagination. If you like Tim Burton, you'll appreciate the look and feel of this movie. Danny Elfman also composed a fantastic soundtrack that adds to the mood. Also, the special effects are fabulous, realistic, and interesting."
4,"Good Effects, Great Cinemetography, Story...eh....","Though I myself gave this a pretty high rating, I could understand why many wouldn't. My suggestion to you--have you not seen this movie-- is to check it out at your local Blockbuster first. The only people that I could think that would instantly love this movie, are those (Like myself) Who did the same with Beetlejuice, Batman, B2, Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas.....so forth. Do you love these movies? Go for it. The problem with this mainly is the dragging storyline and the ~in opinion~ 'stupid' ending. If you have a big screen and surround sound speakers, and you just love heads rolling, cool sword fighting, and eye candy then this DVD is great. But there isn't much else except Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) keeling over about every two seconds."
5,This movie is Great!,"I think this movie is a great film the best I've seen yet, Johnny Depp is a great actor in this film. And I think everyone should see it because I highly reccommend it. Please buy this because it's a great film. And if you disagree then you e-mail me and tell me why you hate it."
5,GORY,"whoa, I thought this movie was going to be an average film. I was wrong this movie is an excellent film, it has very good acting by both Johnny Depp and Christina Riccha. A cool plot from an old story, but really weird twists are added to it to make the movie better. Oh yeah there is a lot of blood in this movie."
4,not what I was expecting,"This movie was not at all what I was expecting. That is a good thing. The marketing of this movie made me think that it was firmly set in the action/adventure genre. Not really my cup of tea - that. I suppose I should have known better with Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci starring and Tim Burton at the helm, but they wouldn't have been the first to do commercial [stuff] to supplement more worthy films. (please note that not all commercial is [bad] and not all [stuff] is commercial) Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie and indeed, I bought it. It was dark and mysterious and whodunnit and magical and they didn't really follow up with the gadget thing."
3,5 Stars for This? * * * * * ?,"This film has good costume, setting, cast and cinematography, but I am a bit bamboozled why so many people gave it five stars. This film is Tim Burton full-on rich filmic style and action, but perhaps too much so. It is too long, dizzying, and puerile. It's a fun film to watch on a rainy eve, but a landmark production? Well, perhaps some of these other reviewers have lost their heads."
5,probably the best autumn/winter setting,"Tim Burton is and always will be an awesome director. as far as this movie goes, the atmosphere of the movie is so incredibly decorated and detailed that the movie, even though could be described as a horror/slasher film, is beautiful. there is comic relief in the film as well, and its intelligent in the way that like another reviewer stated before, there are very limited jokes in the film, just the way that expressions are displayed happen to be entertaining. this movie is a great movie, especially around the fall. Watch this movie."
4,A wonderful fantasy film,"Tim Burton does a marvellous job in re-creating the legendary tale of the Headless Horseman. Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to Sleepy Hallow to find and capture the Horseman (wonderfully played by Christopher Walken). The special effects are great, the acting is superb and this is definately a film that will scare and make you laugh, all at the same time. One of the best of 1999."
5,Excellent movie for everyone,"After seeing this movie i gained total respect for Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp. They played their parts beautifully, and that made the movie wonderfull. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should, because it was brilliantly done."
1,Boring and sad,"I just read a review by Michael D Ward, entitled UGH that said it perfect. I could not agree more.This was a sad remake of a chilling story, 'improved' to the point that is no longer the same story other than the names. And what was wrong with the original? It only lasted centuries, unlike this which will only last that long as landfill. The storyline was paper thing and very easy to guess what was happening next. There was no fear or horror, just a sad boring film.If you want to see this, I sugest renting and not buying."
2,It had a few good points but was mostly just drivel...,"I had pretty high expectations when I popped this in the DVD player. After about 20 minutes those expectations turned into prayers..... prayers for something good to save this movie but it never happened. The first scenes were OK and there was some intrigue, but it quickly got dull and just plodded along not knowing what to do next.Ichabod Crane isnt sure what his plan is, he just wanders from place to place without much direction. Depp played the character well, I just didnt like the character! Christina Riccis character seemed totally disinterested with what was going on. It might have been Ms. Ricci since I consider her a pretty low-grade actress. The rest of the cast was OK but noone jumped out as special or well-thought out.This *might* be worth a rental if you're desperate but I really do NOT recommend this film. Those that like it must be fans of Depp or Ricci. The many high reviews puzzle me...???"
1,falls apart fast,"It's atmosphere is mesmerizing, but little else is. Not only does it rip apart the original tale, but it does it in a very cliche and disappointing manner by making it ""the wicked step-mother/witch"" whom was beind it all. I love Tim Burton's films, which is all the more reason this broke my heart. Through my childhood I loved this dark fable, and I could think of no better person to make a film of it then Tim Burton. I guess his heart (or more likely his head... pun slightly intended) wasn't in this.Stick to BATMAN RETURNS, ED WOOD, and BEETLEJUICE.READ THEDA MORGANS REVIEW, it was right on the nose.""It looks good, but not much else."""
1,Bad Bad & Bad !,"I'm even spending my time on writing on this one, I'll just suggest you all NOT to see this movie, there is nothing to see, the story is bad and sticky, there is too much science fiction, and even the sound doesn't compensate on it, in shortly, all the signs for bad movie......"
1,sleepy hollow,"This is one of the worst films i have ever seen...They try to make a funny horror which doesn`t work .It shold be one or the other , in this case they should of went for horror . Do not rent or buy this film , you will be very dissapointed."
1,Don't buy from this seller!!!,"Stack and Stack waited 3 weeks after I placed my order to let me know that these lights were out of stock. I placed the order on Sept 20 and today, Oct. 12, I received an email stating the lights are out of stock. Very poor customer service!!!"
3,"All right, but much better out there...","This game was all right. I ordered it at the same time I ordered several other WWII RTS games. It may have been good in it's time, but Company of Heroes is MUCH better"
2,Not Satisfied,The sound quality is quite poor on this product. I would NOT suggest that others buy it. There is a lot of static on every radio station.
3,What I expected,"This product came quickly and was everything I expected. The sound quality is not perfect, but is is not horrible. It really depends on the area you are in and what kind of reception you get. Good quality for the price paid. I use it everyday and would buy it again."
2,Does not charge,"The sound is great thru the FM radio, but does not charge the IPOD nano G4.I took it back to the people that sent it and they tryed others, with no success in charging.I liked the way it sounded though, so I kept it. Will need car charger to recharge the IPOD."
4,A good product,"I like having my Ipod in my car, but all of these FM transmitters have the same problem: you have to really play with the stations (both on the radio and transmitter) to get a good broadcast... Otherwise, I like that this setup holds my Ipod, as long as you have enough room to plug it in-- mine gets in the way of the shifter."
2,sent me the wrong one,"They sent me a white one that looked completely different than the one pictured, but it works well nonetheless, but I do wish they would not advertise a different product than pictured. 2 stars because it worked well"
3,I Like It,It works good but make sure that it's mounted properly in the car or the music fades in & out.
1,YOU ONLY GET 1 !!!!,"I'm a busy office worker, and I'll admit, sometimes, I race through things, but when I go online to buy a product and I see two pictures with the two things that I came to buy, I assume that's what I'm getting. The item arrived fine, the one I received was what I was looking for, but YOU ONLY GET 1 carafe!"
1,Waste of Money,"The sad thing about buying cosmetics online is the fact that you are not able to test out the product first. So if you don't know the color you are suppose to buy, you run the risk of buying the wrong color. And that was the case with me. In the end it was a waste of money"
3,Nice looking,This is a nice looking planter and by concept is a good idea but this planter gets in the way of the usefulness of the umbrella and when it rains it overflows onto the table I ended up throwing the planter out after he first season it just wasn't worth the hassle
1,Umbrella plant holder,This item is literally crumbling at the edges as it sits on our patio table. The quality is terrible especially for such a pricey item.
2,not worth the money,"Don't buy it. Just go to your local home depot, any auto parts/accessories store, etc. and you can get a much better deal."
3,not the best....,"I was tried of cheap bits and finally broke down to buy quality bits, whiteside was at the top. So I thought. The bits looked made well and liked the great storage case. The bits worked great on soft/ med woods, but hard woods, tearouts, and poor results. And the bits do not hold up there edge. I will stick to Frued bits in the future, unfortunately, no storage case."
1,Don't waste your time and money on this.,"In the first place this is NOT a course for intermediate students; it is 100% basic. All the phrases are short, simple and always in the PRESENT tense. Wow! What a dated way to teach a language!The multiple choice questions are naive. They will show you a cat and the choices will be as silly as asking you if a)that's your grandmother, b) that's a rainy day c) that's your pet. Who would not answer?The general idea is good and might be fun, but from the linguistic point of view, the course is really poor. It lacks context, it is too short, there's no central story to follow and the course is based merely on short, disconnected phrases.If you really want to learn French from the start, I highly recommend you to get ""GET INTO FRENCH"" a great little course for beginners by the University of Cambridge and the BBC. That one is a GREAT, FANTASTIC French Course for beginners and is also affordable."
3,Cheap Protection,"This clear case has protected my blackberry well, however the belt clip broke off leaving me with an annoying stub on the back side and no way to attach it to my belt. This however has happened with many cases, so I was not surprised."
2,Poor quality,"This is my first Hot Wheels in at least 15 years. I love the new Eclipse (and esp. the new Eclipse Spyder) so I bought this to put on top of my LCD monitor. The quality of this diecast model, made in Malaysia, is really poor. The item arrived new but the paint has already faded or chipped off, and the whole thing looks and feels no better than a couple of 99-cent generic diecast cars I bought in Brooklyn last year. Very disappointed. But the 2005 Eclipse Concept Coupe is a beautiful animal!"
4,"Beautiful and Uplifting, If Not a Classic","Tiger is an elusive creature. Like most of Joni's work, it takes several listenings (at least) to grasp the subtle complexities and beauty of individual songs or the work as a whole. And, as a whole, this album works. Mitchell's voice is at its recent best and there is a sweet hopefulness in many of these songs. 'Harlem in Havana' is simply one of the most intriguing and innovative pieces of pop music in recent memory: jazzy, complex, sultry and mischievous. 'Man From Mars' is a stunner, featuring Brian Blade on drums and evoking the prettier moments on Court and Spark (and should be released as a single). 'Crazy Cries of Love' is sexy, jazzy and also deserving of a wider audience. 'My Best to You' is a sweet, forgiving lullaby. While Tiger is not one of Mitchell's best (her best rank at more than five stars and are off the scale), it is nonetheless an uplifting work of beauty and an appropriate addition to Mitchell's remarkable body of work."
3,A little disappointing,"Joni Mitchell is one of the great geniuses of contemporary music. Her work as a songwriter, singer, instrumentalist and record producer has not been matched. Her output as an artist is astonishing. However she occasionally gets it wrong and 'Taming the Tiger' is one of those projects. The production of this album is what is most disappointing, way too many layers of cliched (c. 1980's) keyboards smother the vocals and melodies. There are some stand outs 'Harlem in Havana' is one of her best and most inventive songs to date, 'Happiness is the best Facelift' is a lovely, wise and unforgettable song, her cover of 'Here's to You' is poignant but nearly unlistenable due the overbearing Vangelis-like synthesizers. I will always buy Joni Mitchell records 'sound unheard' the day they come out, but this is one I haven't wanted to listen to all that much."
2,"Worst disappointment since ""Mingus""","I loved ""Hissing of Summer Lawns"", another experimental album by Joni. I've followed her down the highways of ""Hejira"". I fell in love with her on ""Blue"" and ""Court and Spark"". But there's just nothing for me here. In fact, I try to chase some of the melodies out of my head because I find them irritating. Joni, you shouldn't have tamed the tiger at all. You should have let it out of the cage. Please begin writing with a vengeance again. Your words are your weapons and they strike straight to the heart. This album is so spare, it sounds like you have applied your muse to painting in the past few years. And I can't hear that."
4,A pleasure to listen to!,"Like many of Joni's albums, ""Taming the Tiger"" takes time to get to know, but the rewards pay off. It's just as hauntingly beatiful as ""Turbulent Indigo,"" without the over production. Will she ever put out something mediocre? I doubt it."
3,Blake's memories are not enough,"Joni's work is familiar, revolving around the usual rhythms , and she doesn't stop the heart of the affectionate listener. A little more aloof than usual, with an almost mystical touch in the lyrics, sounds like she stopped to search for a while, holding the breath and looking back.."
2,"Mozart, My A@@!!! An incredible disappointment!!","The recent hype surrounding this release has Joni proclaiming herself the equal to Mozart - unfortunately, the material on this CD is nowhere near as coherent or moving. THE CRAZY CRIES OF LOVE has its moment - but the bulk of the rest of the material lacks form and substance. It's as if she's forgotten how to write a song. The lyrics are successful as POETRY, in some instances, but they don't hold up as SONGS. And the production/arrangements, other than the magnificent contributions of Wayne Shorter, are juvenile and clumsy. Joni discovers synthesis - 20 years after everyone else! - Big Deal!! Her bitterness towards life and acrimonious ingratitude towards the music business and her audience pervades this outing. Enter at your own risk - the tiger is far from tamed!!"
2,SWEET BUT SO BORING,"Upon further listens to a 'Taming the Tiger' cassette a friend made for me, I'm still perplexed. Joni still has a way with words, but there are no real MELODIES on 'Tiger,' and the songs all start to sound the same after a while. Also, it is very SLOWWWWWWWWWWW. Do NOT listen to the album while driving!!!!I'm so glad I didn't spend any money on this album."
2,"""Taming The Tiger"" Has No Claws, No Spirit","In ""Taming The Tiger,"" you can still recognize Joni Mitchell's voice even though it's darker now by age and cigarettes. She works to get the characteristic lilt and lightness in her voice now with whispers. The songs, however, are middle-age circumstance, lyrics right on the money and touching a familiar chord with anyone over 40. But for a legendary songwriter who has been so prolific over more than three decades, ""Taming The Tiger"" comes up short, literally -- it's LP-length (44 minutes), including a totally uninspired instrumental, ""Tiger Bones,"" (length 4:22) plus the worst CD technical indexing mistake I've ever heard on a compact disc -- 50 seconds of nothingness between tracks 10 and 11. It may be symbolic of a work from Joni that's simply too little, too late. David Henderson"
2,Feels more like court than spark.,"This album is a tremendous disappointment. Joni has matured with a stream of wonderful albums including ""Night Ride Home"" and ""Turbulent Indigo,"" but she seems to be running out of lyrical ideas in this effort. There are flashes of lyrical insight mixed with some that are genuinely awful: ""I can't get thru the day/Without a big boo-hoo""??!?? Echhh!!! Joni has a reputation as a poet, but these lyrics sound more like essays or complaints grafted onto the music. Sometimes she sounds less angry than crabby. Musically, though, she still writes on a level that few artists can dream of, much less achieve, but all the musical richness seems like a background track to a series of ill-tempered grumblings. I kept waiting for the knockout song like ""The Magdalen Launderies"" or ""Borderlines,"" but it never came. This disk is short and sweet, without the sweet. She's still The Goddess, but listening to this is an act of piety rather than adoration."
1,A better showcase for Joni's painting than her music...,"Joni's voice still sounds wonderful - the years have added huskiness and character that is quite appealing. Unfortunately, with the same, identical guitar sound on every single track, this album is a study in monotony. As much as I want to hear Joni's singing, I just can't sit through the rest. This one stays on my bottom shelf."
2,Back to Turbulent Indigo,"Back to Turbulent Indigo I rush after hearing this, the most disappointing album ever released by my favourite artist.The songs on this record sound so bland, they sound like someone trying to imitate Joni, badly. The production values are very old hat, the keybored (sic) sounds are sad. Sorry, Joni, love your work but I'm consigning it to the second-hand store."
5,Excellent book for children,"Larry Gonick's comics for adults, especially The Cartoon History series, are great, but may be too advanced for younger children. This new children's book is an absolute delight, full of both giggles and suspense. There are a few moments that may be a little too intense for children under the age of six, but everything turns out all right in the end."
1,Disappointed,"What is it with so many of the modern generation bands that can't come up with their own ORIGINAL names (ie: People, Damnation, Touch, etc.)? It seems that everytime I turn around I find there is another young group ripping off the name of yet another steller band from yesteryear.I was afraid that THIS ""Big Daddy"" might not be the same band from Rhino Records' formative years of the early 80's, who issued several albums, taking 'current' songs and cleverly reworking them in the musical styles of the 50's & 60's. (Sadly, very little of their catalogue has been issued in CD format, other than the available ""Best of..."" disc and the out-of-print reworking of the Sgt. Pepper's album.)Unfortunately, I was right. This is just another unimaginative, late 90's group doing nothing particularly inventive. Least of all, coming up with an original name of their own. And, unfortunately, I had to waste my money to find this out. Hopefully, though, my painful experience will save YOU a few bucks."
1,"Eh...........""Truth In Advertising"" needs to be invoked here","This is NOT the Big Daddy who, along with Tina Turner, justified radio's mere existence during the hideous Eighties. These twerps evidentally waited for Big Daddy's demise (the REAL Big Daddy), and stole their name and schtick. It's your money, do what you like, but I'd advise patience, because the real, live, LEGITIMATE Big Daddy is reforming this year. Caveat Emptor!"
3,A good effort,"I took a chance and bought a copy. OK so some of the stuff is reminiscent (which is a nice way of saying derivative) of the Beatles and Genesis and the Stones and King Crimson and other somewhat more progressive bands of the late 60s-early 70s, but that was all good music and I applaud this band for borrowing from such cool sources for their muse. Stand outs on this record are the OH SO GEORGE Harrison-ish ""Eyes Wide Open"", the wanna-be Gabriel ""The Exit"", and the real classic rocky ""5 Weeks Running"". Certainly not a bad record for what sounds like a bar band with a low budget and a little production. You could buy a Britney Spears record for $15 and get all the unimaginative derivative music you can handle and it probably wouldn't be as good a value as this."
3,It's ok,"IT does not cover the baby up to his head. After I bought this one, I saw many other stroller bags that covers all the baby, the only thing showing is the face. So, with this one you still need to put a lot of cloth to cover you baby.The good thing is that once you install it in the stroller it stays and doesn't move."
4,Baby Jogger Foot Muff,Baby Jogger Foot Muff BlackThis has helped in the cold winter months to keep my baby warm. I have added a lambs skin liner to add additional comfort which I would definitely recommend. I like that you can unzip the top waterproof cover and have the liner on it's ow.n The only downside is that the foot muff doesn't fit as neatly into the pram as I would like but this is not a big inconvenience. All in all it does the job of keeping baby warm and dry.
3,Just OK,"This work is just OK. Very sub-par when you consider Blue Planet or Planet Earth sets. It's a shame that the production company used a Cessna instead of a helicopter( you can see the plane's outline in many shots). The ""fly-over""'s were just way to quick. The music is just terrible for it . Granted; you can choose Native American music which certainly adds to the feel of the landscapes but the Orchestral score is nothing stellar. Either music set you choose; niether is perfectly matched. Bottom line is; the views and contnet are just ok which certainly befits the lower price tag. I can't help but feel like there should have been more and better content."
3,1080P-Highway,"The Arizona landscape is 2nd to none. However, I do wish they would have covered a little more of the state as well as spending more time in Monument valley.If you have the desire to see great vistas, landscape untouched by man, as well as some hints for travel or a reminder of your previous trips,...this will satisfy most definitely."
1,Big deception,"Oversaturated colors and lower than average images kills this documentary. I've been few times in this area and I know how beautiful and powerful images you can film there. Sometimes, oversaturated colors are so unreal that it looks like a posterization effect. Staying closer to natural colors and getting off the road more time could help.Big Deception...Cheers."
2,you get what you pay for,"Having watched the BBC's planet earth on HD-DVD I went in search of somethingelse in that genre and came across this disc. Living in Arizona I thought it'd be fun to have a copy. When I watched it I must say I was some what disappointed. The editing is really quite poor. At times they flip back and forth between shots in a manner best suited to some MTV video, not a scenic portrayal. Then there are the ""shot out of the car window"" pieces that don't really seem up to the task. My final gripe was that no matter what I did to the color settings I could not get a realistic rendition of what I've seen in person a number of times.. In conclusion, it's probably worth 11$ if you've never been to all the places they show, but only 11$ - you get what you pay for."
3,HD DVD moyen,Les couleurs ne sont pas toujours naturelles ( trop rouge par rapport à la réalité ) et la vidéo est trop courte ( 20 minutes )!
2,Good Scenery,"This is good for scenery, but lacks a little bit for HD. It also lacks for the choice of music. It's basically the same music throughout or your choice of Native American Music, which is also basically the same music throughout. One good point is that it isn't too expensive to purchase."
1,Very disappointed.....,"I couldn't wait to receive this DVDDreaming Arizona [HD DVD] and check out the beautiful scenery advertised for this DVD....the DVD would not play on my DVD player or my computer.....I sent it back to Amazon describing the problem and they immediately shipped another ""identical"" DVD....got it in two or three days....again I was excited to see the, advertised, aerial views of the beautiful desert southwest...the trouble was....the key word here is ""identical"" DVD, which meant the DVD was....you guessed it...blank....I could not believe Amazon would not have checked their stock of this DVD to assure they removed all the ""bad"" one's ! After this I was going to order another one but Amazon just sent me a credit for the 2nd DVD....I still wanted the correct DVD...!!! I'm thru ordering from them until they rectify this problem."
5,Good buy,"My brother loved it while visiting Peru, so naturally I had to get this for his birthday. It was his favorite gift!"
3,multi-national beverage anyone?,"come on now, eight bucks?It's ok, but now just another victim of the cola giant juggernaut.was better before... really eight bucks. save your money...go there and have one if you must..beautiful country and people."
1,Don't waste our money!!!! Just some good ole' dirt.,"I've used a number of AHAVA products and I don't think they are worth the packaging they're sent in. There really is nothing exceptional about Dead Sea minerals or mud, and its not worth the cost to human lives by buying AHAVA products, since they use Palestinian resources that are illegally appropriated, according to international law, and as recognized by the United Nations."
2,"Good concept, faulty zipper","We bought this to protect our Britax Roundabout on our annual cross-country flight back to see the family at Christmas. We like the concept that it has more than one use, however, while we were zipping the car seat in at the airport, the zipper started separating. We were able to get it to zip back together and it seemed fine once we got it closed, but I was worried about our expensive car seat during the flight. We had the same problem coming back. It seems like they should get a much stronger industrial zipper that does not have teeth that will just come apart. I was especially surprised because our car seat is one of Britax's smaller seats - as I understand it the popular Marathon model is wider. I don't think this bag would work at all for anything larger. As it is, I will probably purchase a new bag when we fly again so that the airlines do not wreck our seat if this cover comes off."
5,jello freak,I've loved jello since I was a little boy. What can I say about the original jello; love it. Cranberry flavor is a nice diversion from the standard flavors.
5,Another lost classic,"Another out-of-print classic from Island/Mango. As with ""Club Ska 67"", this contains a nice mix of popular hits (""Man in the Street"", ""Train to Skaville"") with more obscure numbers that aren't available on every other ska compilation out there (""Congo War"", ""Run Joe""). I used to have a cassette with this on one side and ""Club Ska 67"" on the other side which was a permanent resident in my car's cassette deck, circa 1993. I'm glad I grabbed this on CD when I had a chance, since Island is obviously content to let Trojan grab all the dollars/pounds from today's fans of old-time ska with their inferior, repetitive compilations."
5,First Step to Work-At-Home Success,"If you are serious about working at home or creating a career you can get excited about, this book is an absolute must! I have been providing work at home information and resources for over 7 years at Work-At-Home Success and this book is always the first thing I suggest to people who ask, ""How do I get started working at home."" Many people approach working at home with, ""What can I sign up for that will pay me."" But this is the wrong approach. Inventorying your skills, experience, interests, and passions and then designing a career you love is the best way to find success working at home. Finding Your Perfect Work is the perfect workbook to achieve this goal."
5,A practical career guide offering personal style surveys,"Now in a newly revised and updated edition for the twenty-first century, Finding Your Perfect Work by Paul Edwards and Sarah Edwards is a practical career guide offering personal style surveys, information about degree requirements, an alphabetical directory of self-employment careers, and much, much more. A handy, easy-to-use resource for finding a path in life that one enjoys most, Finding Your Perfect Work is a welcome and recommended addition to personal, job center, and career counseling reference collections and reading lists."
2,Nancy Drew #17,"Don't get me wrong I am a HUGE Nancy Drew book fan. I have read most of the books in the series and only disliked few. This one was OKAY, it is probably 2 or 3 stars. I found it too easy to figure out in some parts I would think ""I can't believe Nancy Drew fell for that"" or something like that. I wouldn't want to read it if I were you."
4,Almost Perfect,"Of course, every detective needs a day off of sluething! So naturally, Nancy decides to go on a cruise with her fellow detectives, Goerge Fayne and Bess Marvin. While boarding the ship, Nancy notices a man on the pier spell out her name saying 'Beware of Nancy Drew and Ne' but did not see the rest. As she goes to her cabin, she finds Nelda Detwieler in the cabin too. At first, Nancy distrusts the native girl. Then Nelda tells Nancy of what happened to her, and mysterious things happen when a mysterious trunk is delivered to their cabin that is identicle to Nancy's but is not hers.I think this book is very good and I highly recomend it so that if you go on a cruise and your trunk is not delivered but someone elses and a desparete girl with an amazing story is set in your cabin, you now what to do!"
4,Great,It was great just great!!!!I just about ready to read the next one.Wish me luck trying to put it down!!!!!
2,Not Much Mystery Here,"This review concerns the original 1940 edition. The trunk which Nancy takes with her on a cruise to South America, along with a similar trunk owned by another passenger, appear to be at the center of a mystery. This book was alright, but I found that it really didn't have a mystery to it until the last few chapters. The first part of the book concentrates on the efforts of the mother of one passengers to keep Nancy from sailing. Ultimately, the mystery is somewhat dull and predictable and the book lacks much action. The book is probably worth reading, but I doubt that it will be one of many people's favorites."
1,THIS IS A BETA RELEASED BY US PUBLISHER.,"I had bought this game since I got a kick out of the previous two entries from the designer ""Sudden Strike"" and ""Sudden Strike II"". A pretty tight and enjoyable set of RTS games. I had bought this hoping for the same thing however it is far from the mark. The interface is the same, however that is where it all ends. The copy that I bought I couldn't get past the first couple missions, even when I hit all the reqiured mission reqiurements I still got a failed mission hit. The other thing that would happen is a CTD when I tried to load a saved gamed. So after looking online at the designers website I found out that the are in the process of sueing thier US Publisher since the Publisher released a early Beta of the game. So there are all sorts of loop holes and undocumented features and features that are supposed to exsist. The designers aren't even willing to put a patch out for those of us that have bought this bogus bit of a game. STAY AWAY FROM IT."
4,Not for Quad Cable,"These connectors work perfectly with regular RG6 cable, but I've recently run into a problem where they will not work with newer RG6 Quad cable I picked up. They say they will, but I found it impossible to put the connectors on the bigger cable. Other connectors that say they are RG6 Quad specific work perfectly on this cable, so it must be a connector problem."
1,Physically hurt my ears!,"I purchased the headphones from my local Radio Shack store. Tried them out on my iPOD 30 GIG. My ears are still sore from trying to find a set of ear covers,(3 sets included with the Super.fi3s) I never really did get a fit. I did get them to actually seal my ears, but I had to sit perfectly still on the soffa. These would never work for any sports application.After trying several different types of music,(Rock, Jazz, Video sound tracks and techno), it became very apparent that there was practiclly no low end. I coud increase the low end slightly if I jammed them in my ears to the point of pain.These babies are not for everyone. I've seen some impressive reviews on this unit, but for my ears they simply were a poor fit, not to mention acoustics. I have tried a set of Sennheisers, that don't jam into my ears and they both sound great and the fit is not an issue."
5,Fantastic Ear Buds,"For those of us who are partial to the earbud style headphones, these are by far the best for the money. I thought I'd hate the upside-down, over-the-ear-wire style (my ears are small and the over-the-ear styles don't generally work for me), but I really love these. The cable has a bendable wire inside so you can shape it however you like. The sound is great and they really do block out outside noise when the music is playing. In fact, my husband had to resort to tossing a pillow at me in order to get my attention as his calling my name and whistling had no effect. We each bought a pair of the Super.fi 3's and for what we use them for (simply listening to music and podcasts) they are perfect. Ultimate Ears had a first rate product here and the next set of ear buds I buy will be Ultimate Ears as well. (Sadly, I do lose an alarming number of headphones!)"
2,Not appropriate for running.,"I've tried etymotic in-ear earbuds and now have these UE. I really liked the etymotic buds for the fit; no matter how hard my workout was they stayed in place. The wires are sensitive to noise though and I could pick up on the rustling of my shirt or jacket against the wires; and they are fragile, so mine eventually were worn down by wear and tear. UE do not fit well, no matter what choice of tip I use. They are heavy in the ear, the cord is heavy, both causing them to fall out constantly, or feel like they're falling out. The sound is good though, and I don't hear rubbing from the cord while I run. Because they are better insulated than etymotics I think they're also able to take a beating better (being thrown in my purse, wrapped around my ipod; all the things I'm not supposed to do...)."
3,No base whatsoever,"Just to warn everyone...great sound and fit the ear well with the numerous ear plugs provided. However, there is absolutely no bass...everything sounds as if you turned off the lowest frequencies on an equalizer. Very weird! I went on the internet and many others have had similar problems. Tried many adjustments but could not get any bass from the headphones and had to return them. I gave the product three stars because the remaining sound is quite good and the isolation from the ear plugs is excellent. There is just no bass and most music just doesn't sound right. I instead went with the v-moda vibe and they are excellent with great bass response and cheaper."
4,Great Earbuds,"I've wound up using the single sized double bud, that's what I call it. These sound great, maybe the best I've ever owned. I'm sure the much more expensive ones sound better hence 4 stars, I'm leaving some headroom for judgment. That said, these sound great. My only complaint is my ears tickle after I've worn them for a bit. They stay put just fine, I wear glasses and find the over the ear hook arrangement just fine, no issue, no noise. My primary use is with an iPod Touch. Love 'em!"
4,Decent Earbuds,"The Super.fi 3 earbuds work well. The mids and highs are very clear and clean, however I'm a little disappointed in the Bass. I tried several of the ear pieces including the foam, and none of them had much impact on the sound. On the plus side, these do block outside noise extremely well.Again, the music sounds excellent, but if you like pounding bass look elsewhere."
4,Burn them in first!,"Right ""out of the box"" these sound a little on the thin side. Plug them into your regular audio system (check the volume so you don't over-power them) and let them get a few hours of play time before you insert them into your ears... you'll be a lot happier... after 10-20 hours of ""burn-in"" time.Great for working out at the gym!"
3,"Great sound, not much bass","These are the best in ear phones I have tried. Mids and highs are not perfect, but nice. Very flat response. Nice. But the webpage on their site says for classical music and jazz. They don't mention other genres for this model.I don't think they have enough base for any other genre of music. It is there, and goes low, but not loud enough. Turning up bass on music source does not help.I would recommend that bassheads go for a higher model, but definitely stay with Ultimate Ears."
1,Waste of Money,"These must be the most over rated ear phones. The problem with these are:1) You need to be an expert to put these on, otherwise sound doesn't come out properly.2) There's virtually no bass what so ever...3) staging? for get about it.Conclusion, these are just not worth the $. I thought my $30 Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones was bad...these are even wrose."
1,"Cheap-looking, inflexible cabling",Although these headphones are acoustically good I turned them down because of their unbelievably cheap-looking inflexible cable. The cabling was so irritatingly stiff and unmanageable comparing to my iPod stock headphones cabling that I just couldn't use them.
2,"Great fit, not so great sound","These earphones felt AMAZING! However, the minute you move you hear thump, thump, thump. Any movement in the wire and you hear it over the music. I got them as gift to run with, returned them after 2 days."
3,Good But Defintely Not Great,"If you currently only use the ipod headphones and you're looking for something better you are in a great position. Lots of options out there but the ultimate earphones have more cons than pros. Yes, they are much MUCH better than the stock headphones and they do have great sound. Amazing almost. The catch? The Cord!!! They designed the cord to be so stiff that it will not budge. I still have the original creases and bends from the packaging it came with and if you're planning to shove them into your pocket you had better think twice. The part that wraps around your ear has a wire. A wire that, if not careful, will snap!In retrospect I would've purchased the shures or something else. The cable is simply just not worth it. I would've given the headphones a 4 star review for sound quality (A five for the UE 5's) but until they redesign that cable, they lose an entire star just for that."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I bought these earphones because the product description made them sound very good. All I can say is that if you like to workout in the gym then these earphones are not for you. They constantly slip out of your ear and the sound quality is horrible. They have virtually no bass whatsoever. The cord is suppose to go behind the back of your ear but its just a big hassle. They never stay in place. If you want to use these earphones for riding on buses or in waiting rooms the you just might like them. Other than that, I dont recommend them at all."
3,unimpressed,"I would not recommend these earphones. The cable is not flexible enough near where it connects to the earphone itself, meaning that it is forced to absorb all of the tension that builds up from everyday, active use. After about 2 weeks of moderate usage the + and - wires within right the cable snapped, even though the black plastic covering them was fine. Ultimate Ears apparently foresaw this because they made it possible to replace the cable, however they charge $20 for them plus around $13 for shipping! on top of that the sound is simply unimpressive and flat. i'd recommend the Sony MDR-EX51LP earphones. they give a much more balanced sound and can be had for around $20 these days."
4,I have glasses~ noise cancellation...,"i received these earphones Feb 16th 2008i wear glassesfirst of all, they dont have complete noise cancellation like i read in reviewsit does reduce noise, but not completely, i can hear a clock ticking when im alone in a quiet roomthe wires are pretty stiffi like the sound qualityit doesnt come with a leather case...it is pretty annoying with glasses because the back of your glasses go on the top of your ears but the wires are therei find it easiest to put the earphones on first and then putting on glasses, still... they get in the wayi still recommend these headphones"
3,Pretty Good For the Price,"In all I shouldn't complain. Once I got them fitted with the correct sized plugs, they sounded pretty good. It came down to these, Etymotics and Shures all in a similar price range. Unfortunately, this is not the kind of product you want to buy without physically trying a few brands first. So much depends on comfort, fit, and the sound quality you are expecting. To me, they are too uncomfortable for the quality of sound they provide. I got better frequency response with an inexpensive pair of ear buds and I can hear sounds in my environment(like the phone)which I can't do with in-ear monitors. If you are listening to average quality mp3s, you probably don't need extrely high quality IEMs anyway. I wouldn't buy anything again without hearing and feeling them first."
2,Uncomfortable,"The cord is too thick, stiff and rigid for active users. Annoyingly uncomfortable after 40 minutes on the treadmill. I was able to get a good sealed fit. They sound fine but not significantly better than a cheap and comfortable pair of Sony's."
4,Good value and excellent sound,"Solid, quality construction--MUCH sturdier than any Sony earphones you can get. The sound is very good. Recommended!"
2,Had a pair for one year,"Ordered an expensive pair of headphones because I work out a lot and listen to music with other activities. These headphones lasted exactly one year and were no better than a $20 dollar pair. My left headphone went out and I can not get it back. So, I am throwing away and going with a cheaper brand. Its really that simple."
5,Music to my ears!,"Wow! These were such an improvement over the ones that came with my zune. These things sound fantastic with any music, I listen to all types of music and I hear things now I never heard in the past. Once PROPERLY (keyword) inserted in your ear, if your the ""bump in the trunk"" type person, you will love these as they hit the bass and hit it hard. However, when you leave the rap and go to jazz you can hear all the instruments as they should be heard. I am not an ""audiophile"" but I am an avid fan of all things music and log quite a bit of time listening to different music every everyday. These earphones are perfect for that, they are lightweight and comfortable. Remember that long term listening at louder levels will tire your ears quickly. I haven't tried the other earphones that are comparable to these so I can't give you an honest comparison, but these were music to my ears."
2,No Bass,"These earphones are great, only if you dont want bass.With some work you can get them to fit perfectly,Medium to High sounds have great clarity and are pretty good with sound isolation. Though I recommend either of the two below. Please notice the price difference:Super.fi 5 EB White EarphonesSony MDR-NX1 In Style Stereo Dynamic Earphones (White)"
2,good sound bad fit,This is a well packaged quality product. Provides good sound and some external noise blocking. But they do not fit me well. The foam covers are the best of the various covers provided but they become stiff and will have to be replaced often. Perhaps in-ear phones are not for me and I will have to look for some good lightweight headphones to replace these.
4,PERFECT in ALMOST every way...,"The Ultimate Ears deliver as promised. Good sound for the price, and not uncomfortable in the ear. One suggestion I could make would be the ""quality"" of the cord. It feels really plastic-y and is reluctant to ""lay flat"" in all but the hottest conditions. This means that when you pull your phones from the gym bag or your pocket, you have to spend a couple of minutes ""working"" the kinks out. On a price-value basis, I'm glad I bought 'em."
2,tinny disappointment,"After reading reviews for lots of earbuds by both professionals and users, I chose the UE Super.fi 3s. Maybe the quality has declined since they are being made in China (or maybe they were always made there), but these puppies sound tinny, with little bass response, even after an extended burn-in period. Singing voices sound clear and precise, but I have to turn the volume up to even hear the lower frequency instrumentation. It is no wonder that the manufacturer recommends listening with these for no more than an hour a day(!); my ears ring when I take them out. Songs that give me goosebumps on regular buds sound flat and boring on these. Big disappointment. I'm going to return them and keep shopping for something better."
2,Not good for running,You will hear each footstep resounding in your ears if you run with these. I also don't hear any substantial sound improvement over $15 Sonys to justify the price premium.
1,thin,VERY thin tone. They fit but you'll be missing everything below 200k. I won't wear them to perform.
3,Decent but not Worth the Price,"I was excited to try these and as soon as I opened I realized they weren't going to work for me.The cord is too short. I like to golf w/ my ipod in my pocket and the cord is just not long enough. And it's always getting bunched up and doesn't lay nicely.The ear buds are a pain in the butt to get in place (in your ears). If you need to remove the buds a lot, these are not for you.The sounds quality is definitely excellent...but that's not enough for me. I'm going to go buy anothe rpair of the $20 Sony ear buds that have worked great for years....And don't tell me I didn't follow the directions...BECAUSE I DID!"
2,Don't bother,"Sound cut in and out in one ear. Ear buds didn't stay in ears, even with wire fashioned around ear, as instructed. Would not recommend these."
2,Stock Ipod Phones Are Better,"I needed a pair of headphones for exercising that didn't fall out like the stock Ipod ones do so I ordered these. I switched back and forth between these and the Ipod brand and these have less bass and a very ""canned"" AM radio midrange sound. They do have excellent highs but it is very fatiguing to the ear mostly biting highs.I never heard of Ultimate Ears before and this explains why. They really aren't good."
4,"The are comfortable, isolate sound very well but..",At times they feel a little too snug in your ears and sometimes I feel as if they are too much like earplugs. I can play my ipod at half the volume and it still sounds great and is podcasts are fully intelligble at lower volumes. The over the ear rock star stage monitor design is comfortable and comes with many different sized foam tips to fit most ears. Trial and error is the only way to find a comfortable pair. If you find one that is too snug you may end up clompletely sealing your head from sound thus causing yourself to hear yourself breathe..chew...think? It happened to me. Overall pretty good.
3,Hurt my Ears,"The sound is good and I have the right fit. Unfortunately, the silicone is a little too hard and my left ear quickly learns to hate any size cover that I use. I'm going back to my $15 Skull Candy that don't hurt.December 2008 -- I'm still using them after a year, but with ComfortTips. The Comfort Tips make these perfect for me."
3,Great design but no bass,"I recently purchased an Ipod Nano 3g and within a month the earphones that came with it sound as if they are busted. I started researching the different styles in order to find a quality pair that wouldn't break the bank. I came across the Ultimate Ears Super Fi 3 Pros and after reading all the reviews I decided to try them. Over all, I liked the design. I used the small gels and they fit in my ear comfortably (even with my glasses on). The case that came with them was very nice. The only con was the bass. There was none! I let my husband try them to make sure it wasn't just me and he agreed 100%. These earphones would be perfect if they would perfect this flaw. If you like music with lots of bass, I wouldn't recommend purchasing the UE Super fi 3.I would have tried the UE Super fi 5 but the price was higher than I wanted to pay. I guess it's back to researching."
4,Really liked them... great sound... comfortable,"These go in the ear, then up and over the ear, around to the back of it. That's nice because the wire itself helps to keep them in place. This also means that you can remove them from your ear canal without taking them off your ears. I liked this, because it still kept them very convenient.Sound was great. Seemed very precise. I was looking for more bass, though, so in that I was disappointed. But then I looked at the specs and saw that they didn't go that low anyway! I should have known. That was my fault and not theirs.They also dampen external sounds (e.g. plane sound, office chatter) very well."
5,Best earphones,"These are the earphones you can exercise with; they stay in the ear. So many of the ear buds fall out when walking or running, but these earphones come with an assortment of ear buds to fit your ears - and to stay in place. Best ones without it costing an arm and a leg."
2,Extreme disappointment,"Clearly a lot of people have good experiences with these headphones or the rating wouldn't be so high, even Wired magazine lists this brand as a top performer. I wish I could say they were worth the $90 I paid for them, but honestly their performance was far worse than the $20 Sony earphones I have. Maybe I just couldn't get them seated in my ears properly, and oddly difficult task for something as simple as earphones. To create the 'seal' they talk about I had to use the biggest cover, and really secure them where it felt like I had dived too deep into a swimming pool. That produced the best sound, which was, in my opinion, still tinny and severely lacking in bass, like an old clock radio. I returned them immediately. A 2-star rating just because, maybe just maybe, my inability to get them in properly was my fault. Presumably, with 3 sizes and two materials, one of them should have worked, but I wasn't able."
3,Good but cables can be an issue,"These headphones deliver solid sound. While they have a great 2 year warrenty, I've never had to use one so much. The cable constantly is having issues and I have to get them replaced. Given that I have issues, they couldn't be any more helpful. I wish I just didn't have to have these cables replaced every few months."
1,Very disappointing,"I was looking for an upgrade to my cheap Phillips headphones and found these (super.fi 3 studios) on Amazon. The reviews, for the most part, were extremely positive. So, I purchased these. i just received them today and, it appears, I am in the minority. I was extremely disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones. There was a reviewer who said that they sound like a cheap transistor radio. I am inclined to agree with that assessment. The sound quality was extremely thin and tinny. The sound from my $20 Phillips headphones were 100x better and richer sounding. I am going to return these to Amazon. I still want to upgrade, though. Maybe I'll try the Shures."
2,Need both hands to put them on,"Originally wanting a pair of shure headphones, this seemed to be a cost-friendly alternative. First off, I have to use both hands to put each bud in, which is not so convenient when my hands aren't free. After a while you do get used to it and I can sometimes just fit them in my ears with one hand.The bud attachments are always coming off when i pull them out of my bag. I've lost a set already and it's extremely annoying. Fortunately they come with many sets of silicone and foam plugs or various sizes. The bass is indeed lacking, the fitting isn't so great either."
3,Very Disappointed!!!!,"Save your money - Buy another brand!! These earphones were pretty good to start with, although I thought the sound was kinda tinny. After a couple of weeks, these earphones were falling out of my ears. That is the total reason I purchased them!! What a disappointment!!! Somewhere out there are some earphones that stay put, but I have not found them yet!!"
4,Not bad...,"These earphones are not perfect, but depending on your taste may be a good choice....Pros:Good isolation. Clear crisp sound.Cons:Very little bass. A bit uncomfortable to fit correctly every time you use them...In general I like the sound of these little earphones. They isolate you very good from environmental noise and are very musical for Classic and Jazz music. For Pop and Rock I would wish for a lot more bass. The earbuds are a bit uncomfortable, since it takes some time to fit them correctly every time you use them. Only when adjusted correctly you can really benefit from the sound and isolation. When you are somewhere where you have to take them out frequently, this can be somehow disturbing, but for long time listening it is no problem..."
4,"Great at isolation, but uncomfortable","I needed these for listening to movies while riding the extremely noisy PATH and NYC subway systems. These are excellent for this task, I can lower the volume from 100% to 60% and hear things better than before. The downside is they are uncomfortable for long sessions, even with all the adapters for different types of ears. Not a 100% earphone replacement solution, but they are affordable."
4,Great Value,"This is a very amazing quality earphone with such price. The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 is because its hard to fit it at first. It took me a few weeks to be able to have it comfortably fitted because I use it as a stage monitor and I move around a lot. Once you manage to find the ""fit"" the sound quality is very clear especially for mastered musics."
2,"Overpriced, no bass, average mids and highs","These earphones should be in $20 price range. They did not sound any better than the ear buds that came with my Zune. Also as others have stated there was absolutely no bass..... Mids and highs were average. I'm guessing that the higher priced Ulitimate Ears are probably much better, but these are definitely not worth $60+ . I also found them awkward to wear and uncomfortable, but I probably could have gotten used to that if they had performed anywhere near to my expectations. I listen all kinds of music and also write and record a lot of my own stuff. I wasn't expecting ""great"", but I was at least expecting good, at least better than the Zune basic ear buds."
4,"Not perfect, but still good","I bought these after I lost my Klipsch Image S4, thinking to try a new brand and a different design (over the ear). These earphones fit nicely and provide good isolation, same as my Klipsch. However, they seem to lack in the bass frequencies, so I use them only on my PC, for my mobile ain't that powerful to provide necessary boost. Over the ear design keeps them in place and I can walk without the periodic adjustment to keep them from falling. Good set overall, but the sound of Klipsch image S4 is better."
3,"Great sound, not so great fit or build quality","The sound quality on these is fantastic. However, they didn't fit my ears particularly well. I found that the earbuds didn't go deep enough into the ear and tended to fall out. Also, after about a year, some of the cables began to separate from the earbuds themselves."
5,Excellent sound at a decent price,"The sound quality you get from these in-earphones is excellent, especially with little (air-conditioning) to moderate ambient noise (train, not subway). This said, the louder the ambient nose, the less you will be able to enjoy the real quality of these earphone. If you are looking to wear those in a noisy environment mainly, don't bother spending that kind of money and go for cheaper once."
4,Style not good with glasses.,I like the product. It is everything I expected. I research the reviews extensively. I was quite surprised at the noise generated by the over-the ear style as they rub on my glasses. I didn't see a note on this in any of the reviews and thought someone ought to bring up this point. If you wear glasses you will hear noise unless you are absolutely motionless.Something to consider...
4,"Great sound for the price, very comfortable in ears","Super.fi 3 gives you a very clear sound. It is perfect for your ipod if you just listen mp3 or other lossy audio formats. However, if you extremely care about sound, and only listen lossless formats(wave,apple lossless,APE), Super.fi 5 pro is the one you wanna get.I am very pleased with the design of UE earphone. It is very comformtable in your ears, and definetely painless no matter how long you listen."
4,Excellent headphones,"I recently bought these, and compared to my old set of Sony EX71s, they are far superior for the following reasons:1. The fit kit ensures that literally everyone's ear will fit properly. I have ears in between conventional small and medium, but using these babies, I can maintain a seal for 3+ hours even while moving around.2. It's a good deal compared to the Shure e2c's and the Etymotic er6i's, as it is on average of a lower price.3. Extremely (can't emphasize this enough) tough build, especially compared with my always-broken EX71s.Only reason I dinged this product a star is because the form factor is a bit long, which can make it uncomfortable to lean on the ear (ie sleeping) with these headphones in.Don't doubt this purchase, it's worth it."
4,A great purchase for the price/quality conscious,"I have been very happy with these in ear monitors. The sound quality is excellent when compared against every other set of headphones I've owned. For the money, I don't think you can do better. I will confirm that you do have to really shove them deep in your ear to get the desired sound quality. If you think you might have a problem with that, don't buy these. My only complaint is that I didn't get all of the ear attachments that the instructions say I should have gotten in the box. I'm guessing UE changed the shipped contents without changing their instructions an online description. Not a big issue though."
1,No bass at all,"The bass on this product is not acceptable... I paid about US 70 for it, I gave it some time... I tried it for 3 weeks... But even with the correct plugs and after breaking in, the bass is too weak... I tried a friend's creative USD 40 earbuds and they sound much better... the highs and mids were not so accurate as in the UE, but the bass was so much better that the overall result was better..."
1,"sound good, but ...","I bought in-the-ear phones to provide better isolation than earbuds.They sound good but they're kind of large, the wires are a little stiff and transmit noise if you brush them, you really have to screw them in to get them to stay, since they don't sit in that little pocket that earbuds sit in. None of the pads are super comfortable for me either.I'd recommend trying someone else's before you buy them."
3,High priced for the sound quality,"I bought the Super.fi 3s because the iBuds that came with my gen2 Apple iPod did not stay in my ear except when doing nothing but sitting relatively motionless. After checking many reviews I settled on the Super.fi 3 canal earphones -- not too, too expensive with supposedly good sound. There is no question they stay in my ear even with high physical activity as a canal earphone should, and they are very well made. However, the sound is a disappointment -- weak bass even when installed properly. Also, the cord is too stiff for convenience. I have since purchased Lajo silicone canal-skins for my Apple iBuds and find these greatly improve the staying put problem and give me a more preferable sound on balance (list price <$10 versus $100 for Super.fi 3's!)."
1,It broke,"I bought a pair of these that was re-branded as Altec Lansing.After two months of use, one of the cable connectors pulled out at the base of the earpiece. (The cable is designed to detach, but not at the point where it did.) The tiny wires were severed, and vanished into the inside of the earpiece. It's damaged beyond repair.But I was not very satisfied with it anyway. I wear glasses. I had to adjust the over-the-ear stiff wire perfectly to keep it from scraping on the glasses and making a loud noise. Furthermore, the earphones are relatively heavy, and they stick out of the ear quite far. I never did get a good fit with them, after much experimentation.I replaced the earphones with a pair of Zen Aurvana's, just because they were available down in a store down the street from me. I much prefer them. They are much smaller, lighter, and more comfortable. They fit better. I think I could probably fall asleep resting on one of my ears with them on. But I haven't tried it. :-)"
1,"Really uncomfortable. Sound quality good, not great.","I could not find a set of tips that actually fit my ears. The sound was alright, but not worth the pain of wearing these things. I returned them and went with Shure E3. Much more expensive, but worth it."
4,With only one small exception,"Absolutely fantastic portable saw!! It's about time someone has offered a ""portable"" saw with small ""stationary"" power. This saw cuts through tough hardwoods with ease, so with it's compact size it is the perfect saw for small jobs without compromising power. I own the Bosch contractors table saw w/ gravity rise stand, another awesome portable saw, but when doing small jobs it's easier to not have to drag out a bigger saw to complete an easy job. The only draw back is the price and the chincy miter guage that comes with it.If they could cut the cost to $300 they would sell more of them but I paid more and am happy I did. I use it more than I thought I would. Other wise 5 stars easily..."
5,Really Good Tool,"My main complaint about the saw was the piercing, circular saw-type noise. I replaced the blade with a thin kerf Forrest Woodworker II and added a blade stabilizer from Rockler. The improvement in noise reduction and cutting ability was dramatic. I highly recommend this upgrade. The fence is great and dust collection works pretty well with a shop-vac (which drowns out the noise of the saw!)."
3,Its okay for the money,Not as great saw as the one that cost around $500 but good enough for the money.Probably would buy dw744x next time. Works much better.
4,good for small boards only,"It works great like any other Dewalt product i have, since it has no attachements such as infeed or outfees nor extention surface it will only be good for small boards. The Bosch or Craftsman 10"" saw does have extention wings."
3,Over priced plastic saw,"If you like plastic (to be fair, hard poli carb), this is the saw for you. I am surprised by the good reviews to date on this saw to date.Pros: 10"" blade and decent motor. Small enough to fit on 24"" shelves and very portable.For the price I think the saw is inferior to Rigid or Ryobi at Home Depot and an indication that DeWALT is very proud of their name. If I had paid retail for this I think I would have gone out and shot my self.The movable fence isn't bad but the clamps that hold it down to the rail are pot metal clips which will eventually loosen with no way to adjust them. This is what happened to the store model.I kept the saw because it was the best unit in it's size class. It has to fit in my garage cabinets for storage. If you don't have that issue, reconsider the brand for this tool. I love DeWalt cordless system and their sliding compound saw, only way to fly."
2,METALIC SURFACE BROKEN,"THE METALLIC SURFACE ARRIVED BROKEN IN BOTH ENDS OF THE TABLE, VERY DESAPPOINTED.WHAT CAN I DO ???IT 'S INCREDIBLE IN A NEW DEWALT TABLE."
4,First table saw purchased.,"This is the first table saw I have ever owned. Due to limited space in my basement, I needed to think about saving space where possible. This works out just fine. The quality of the product is very good from what I have seen. Only complaint is lack of dado blade compatibility. Would recommend to others."
2,Impossible to create a smooth cut!,"I borrowed one of these saws for a few weeks and it performed well...it was a ""TYPE 1"".Several months later I bought a ""TYPE 2"" (which is printed clearly on the specification stickers on all Dewalt tools...TYPES 1,2,3 and 4)The saw that I bought had to be returned because the arbor had such bad run-out,(the blade moves up and down so bad) that I could not get any where near a smooth cut!The second saw was the same (also a Type 2) I returned one more time, only to get the same results! I wonder what the difference is between the various MODEL TYPES of Dewalt powertools. This isn't the first time that I've run into this problem with Dewalt powertools, I've been a carpenter for thirty plus years.I've bought my last Dewalt tool ! No more for me."
4,"Compact, light weight, portable, and powerful","This is a nice small saw, which is also its weakness, no room for a dado blade, and the fence stops at 16 inches. Miter gauge/guide is pretty much useless, it is too small, flimsy and it pops out too easy. But you can take it right to the work site, and carry it in your trunk."
5,great little saw,I bought this saw to use while I ordered repairs for another and then didn't end up using it for over a year. I set it up yesterday to take out a dado grove for tounge and grove fittings. Great balance and quiet... I'm thinking I'll just leave it set up this way to save time next time I need a tounge and grove application. Great saw for freeing up another main table saw for other settings.
4,excellent so far,"I've only used it a few times, but so far this is a great saw--lightweight and easy to move around, relatively easy to put together, and of course it cuts nicely."
4,Perfect for the remodeler / renovator,"I'm a apartment building remodeler and needed a portable table saw for trim and light carpentry work. I purchased the Bosch 4000-09 because of its portability. In practice, the Bosch was way too big & cumbersome for small jobs and doesn't fit in my Prius. I think the Bosch is a much better table saw with a wider range of applications. The DeWalt DW745 however is the one I actually use. The DeWalt is smooth, exact, powerful and truly portable. I highly recommend it for those who need a high-quality portable table saw."
5,It's about time,"I've been waiting for a compact saw like this since the old portable makita finally died years ago. As an experienced finish carpenter I am putting in my two cents on a tool for first time out of many purchases from Amazon for two reasons. One, the complaints I'm reading about seem to be without merit. And two, this saw is awesome. With every square inch of my truck needed, the compact nature of this saw is great. The ease of loading & unloading daily is made easier. It is sturdy, it cuts like butter, it's extremely accurate, powerfull, and changing measurements is a pleasure. If you have the money & need the extra space in the truck, then buy this saw. If money's a problem you can get the compact delta for a $100, and it works pretty good for the money. If space is a concern, all the other saws are too big and heavy for every day use. The stand is compact also, and the cotterless hitch pins work well for quick set up instead of the nuts and bolts provided"
3,DW745,"Right out of the box the saw is surprisingly accurate. Repeatability is good. It is very easy to move around. The slop in the miter bar and slots is bad but a strip of teflon tape on the bar and a flat file adjustment on the slots gave me zero play. I measured a noload , in a room, 102 dba noise level and would not use it without ear protection. The loosness in the height adjustment makes me expect in time to have unintended blade height problems. With a 4+ hp vac there is a fair amount of dust that blows out on the right side. The real surprise came when I turned the unit over and saw what the in-store-bolted-down displays had hidden. Durability is the big question. I wonder if this is not intended to be a one or two year tax write off , throw away saw. Even at Amazon's lowest price this saw ( after 6 mo duty) is over priced. There are better choices."
3,Dewalt Table Saw DW745 compact 10 inch,"It's OK. First think I did was replace the miter gauge with a good one (Incra Miter 1000SE). While the table size is small and convenient for most use, there are times when a larger table would be nice. I have been unable to find an extension that is manufactured with this table in mind. The edge of the table looks like it was made with tabs and support, but I can't seem to find any extension for it. I guess I'll have to make one. Hope the pieces I need to make will fit on the table!!! The blade cut red oak very well."
4,riving knife adjustment,"Can't review the saw itself yet, but I thought it would be helpful to add this note.To align the riving knife to the blade, use a 5/32 hex for the two locking screws; a square S4 for the actual adjusting set screws. A stubby driver comes in handy.This is nowhere to be found in the manual regarding this alignment on page 10 (English). Neither is the fact that you'd better remove the dust access door (easy) unless you have the hands of a spider monkey. You'd think this adjustment being stressed in the manual as a safety must would have been better detailed.That said, I find the saw nicely built, and hope to add a review of the actual sawing function."
4,Dewalt Table saw ...A delight,I received my saw about a week after it was ordered. It was easy to assemble and set up. I am happy with the unit and would recommend it to any one needing a good table saw that can be easily moved to a job site. It is a bit noisy but is very accurate right out of the box.
5,Great compact table saw,Very happy with purchase of this table saw. Have a small work space and this 5 star quality saw works fantastic. Shipping by Amazon was flawless as usual.
4,DW745 on the jobsite,"The DW745 is light weight and easy to transport. I use it in wood floor installations. It can perform any task that a fixed base table saw can do. At first the plastic table and case were a little disconcerting, but it performs every task, ripping, crosscutting and mitering, very well. Professionals doing heavier work will want to remove the safety guard, as they almost always do."
5,Great Saw!!!!,"I bought this saw for simple projects around the home. Ripping boards is a breeze and the accuracy is excellent. I've ripped 1/8 inch shims 8 feet long without a problem. The saw cuts through boards with ease and no burning. To be totally fair with this review, I bought a Freud D1040X Diablo blade along with the saw and have only used it. I wanted a 40T blade not the 24T that came with the saw. The factory presets were almost perfect out of the box, so set up was fast. I only have one complaint. While adjusting the rip fence, if the rip fence latch has to pass over the adjustment knob the distance is so close, I have cut the top of my thumb on the latch while turning the knob. Nothing to bad, just annoying. Other than that, the saw is excellent."
4,No Dado,"It didn't specify in the ad that it couldn't use a dado. That was disappointing. It was a feature I wanted, other than that it has functioned well."
1,Totally boring and not nice,"The whole movie is as it says no story line, plain dancing. I thought at least the Bikini girl will change her outfit with different types of bikini fashion with different music. or Different dance move yet all the same bikini, same dance move and only music and background graphics changed a bit. BORING!!!!"
3,"Great book, what's going on with the cover though?","I love the inside of this book. However, everybody who sees it on my coffee table says the same thing, ""What's going on with that picture at the bottom?"". Seriously, the main photo is gorgeous and then they just cheaply super-imposed some bar mitzvah picture in the bottom corner. Pretty much ruins the entire aesthetic of cover (which is a big reason you buy a book like this). Just my $0.02."
5,from rags to riches,"i'me new to unix. when i started reading this book i thought what a waste of money but after completing chapter 2 and reading through chapter 3 i realized that it was a gem in disguise. i still haven't finished reading it because i'me reviewing it about 3 weeks after i got it, but i have been messing around knoppix and now, i installed FreeBsd and currently all the examples in the book work. i feel comfortable. By the way, the examples at the end of the book make it somewhat of a school text and it gives u a little challenge at times but they are not gravely difficult."
5,Dudes on front cover...,Guy on right ran over his dog on the way to the photo shoot. Guy on left is getting with Guy on right's wife.
4,perfect for everyday use,"no complains from my wife, she uses them everyday from cooking to preparing frozen fruits for ice blends..."
5,Good Knife Set,"I've worked in professional kitchens in my youth, so I know good knives and what to expect from them. My wife and I received these as a wedding present after registering for them, and though we've only had them 6 months so far they have been awesome. The knives do fit in the block just fine, contrary to what I read in another review. They have not rusted, also contrary to what I've read. The have a great balance on the blade, they handle extremely well, and they hold their edge for a long time before needing sharpening. The only complaint I would have about the set is that it didn't include every knife I could ever need, but the block does have extra slots in it and that's why I'm looking at Amazon.com today - to add some more knives to the set. I would suggest picking up a bread knife at the same time you get the set, it only has a short serrated utility knife in it. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this set."
3,Some knives do not fit in the block,"I received this set for a gift. The 8"" Chef's, and the 7"" Stamped Hollow Edge Santoku do not fit into the block. Did I get a bad block?? Any ideas???"
1,THIS ITEM LASTS SHORTER THAN TWO YEARS,"People often make reviews right after buying an item, so please know that this item was a wedding gift from '09.It is rusted beyond use. At a job with a quality knife company I won't name, I learned why this set sucks so much but is so expensive.It's a cheep knockoff!The Henckles logo SHOULD feature two stick figures as it's logo, and it should be listed as, ""Made in Germany"".This set (and all others that suck like this) have a stick figure holding a spear and are listed as, ""Made in China"".IF YOU WANT QUALITY, DON'T BUY THIS! THIS SET DULLS WITHIN FOUR MONTHS AND RUSTS WITHIN TWO YEARS!On the other hand, I have a set of knives that has lasted 20 years without needing to be sharpened and without rusting. So seriously after having a small set that works really well this item was really disappointing."
2,Not worth it- Watch out for the rust,"I bought the 13 block set about a month ago and now over half of the knives are rusting. Mind you, I only hand wash and dry. Regardless, this is very embarassing for dinner parties. These are just NOT quality knives. I wasted $120 on them please do not do the same."
3,Decent live disc,"""Tear It Up"" doesn't completely do what its title promises, but it's a worthwhile purchase for the Black Uhuru completist. The band plays for an enthusiastic crowd at London's Rainbow Theatre in 1981, and seems to give the fans what they want. While good, it's not completely what I want. For one thing, the sound is mediocre, particularly Michael Rose's vocals. A cleaner sound what undoubtedly help. And since this is pre- ""Red"" and ""Chill Out"" the song selection is limited. In fact, six of the eight songs here are on the studio disc, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."" Really, unless you want a lot of Black Uhuru, stick with that fine album, which has better sound, better performances and the long versions of each song, featuring dub versions. The total time on this live disc is pretty scimpy, too."
4,this should be remastered by island records to get 5 stars,"The Black Uhuru with Sly and Robbie laying down some rhythms that are very good for a live recording, and in some cases a little better than the studio versions. The quality varies from track to track, but overall this is a very good disc. Many of the vocal harmonies come through quite clearly, but at other times not as well, but this is still very listenable. Other than the fact the running time is about 38 minutes this cd is still worth the price, other than that you won't be dissapointed."
5,Great Grips...,"I have used, and broke, many types of bar end grips over the years... These are very durable, do not come off, and are great for grabbing the end of the bars while cranking up a big hill..."
4,"Starts slow, but has a good ending.","This is only the 2nd novel I've read by Elizabeth Chadwick and I have the same comment for both books. They start off slow and most of the action is in the last 1/3 of the book. The climax to the story doesn't unfold into well into the 2nd half of the book. This is a gritty, unadorned novel based on real life characters. The historical part of the book is interesting and well executed. Less satisfactory are the characterizations of the two ""heroes"" and two ""heroines"". The women are portrayed as shrews and at least one of the men is portrayed as a happy-go-lucky incompetent. I guess I like my fictional characters to be a little more honorable and likeable. Overall, I would recommend this book to those who like historical fiction and I will continue to read this author."
5,The Winter Mantle,"This is story about William Marshal, I bought it because it's unavailable in libraries I got it before, and a lot of others wanted to checked it out. That means that this book is deserved to get more ratings and attract more readers and customers who loves Elizabeth Chadwick books, and history of England in twelve or thirteenth centuries. I would recommend the book to everybody, take your time and enjoy the book."
1,"Too much sex, not enough history","I'm a brand new ""fan"" of Elizabeth Chadwick, and the very first book of hers I read, is chock full of garbage love scenes. The book reads more like an R-rated movie, than the historical fiction I prefer. I'm super disappointed, as I had read so many rave reviews. If anyone can tell me of any of Chadwick's historical fiction books, based on real people, that are interesting historical fiction, not bedroom antics, please tell me.I'm returning this one to the public library. Are there any of her books that tell a real story? I'm reticent to begin another. Really a let down.Before I began reading this, I would have liked to know it was a romance novel. Yuck."
4,Norman Conquest,I really like this book. I could relate to the characters. I found it to be a really terrific story.
2,High expectations disappointed,"I'm having a hard time reconciling all of these positive reviews with the mediocre book I just finished. Until about halfway through the book, I considered abandoning it, and I hardly ever put down a book after starting it. Granted, the second half of the story was much better than the first, but even the second half wasn't great.The writing is inconsistent, many of the characters are painfully flat, and for all of the criticisms that I've read concerning this book's close resemblance to a tawdry romance novel, I've read better sex scenes in a Harlequin paperback.If you don't mind the unfocused, meandering plot and shrewish women that fill the first 300 pages, the last 200 pages are somewhat enjoyable. But as a book editor, I don't believe that it's worthwhile to waste a reader's time for very little payoff."
4,Skip hop duo diaperbag-navy,"Diaper bag is very good quality material. Bag has plenty of pockets for all kinds of things inside and out. Bag is great for diaper bag, but I wish it had a little more room(width) inside the bag to throw purse items such as a checkbook wallet and makeup bag so I don't have to carry my purse too. All in all a good purchase and good quality diaper bag."
4,Perfect diaper bag,Perfect gift for the Mom who's not frilly and loves the outdoors. Even Dad doesn't mind carrying it because of the fabric and design...it doesn't look like a purse. Recommend.
3,Nice book for collectors,"This book an artefact for everyone, who is interested in modding and oldtime consoles.Pros: The guide is pretty good, covering all stuff, even soldering skills and working with different materials. You don't have to be a certified electric engineer to reproduce all tasks.Cons: If you read first 4 chapters of book - you read it all. Expirenece with different consoles does not really differs from each other.Wishes: Color pictures :-) and all glory to Ben Heck!"
4,Recycling video consoles,A great book for instruction on how to use old video game systems and transform them into new game systems.
4,Great instructions with some nice humor,"Ben Heckendorn definitely knows what he is doing, and he is quite good at explaining the necessary steps. He writes the instructions so well, that anyone can do these projects, with a little bit of effort.The book gives instructions on how to build a portable Atari 2600, NES, SNES, and PSone. The nice thing is, it illustrates how to build the consoles by hand, or with the aid of a CNC machine.The only reason that I didn't give the book 5 stars is because it would be better if the pictures were in color. In black and white, it can be difficult to see all of the detail.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to try out some fun electronics projects, or anyone who wants to be able to make their favorite classic gaming consoles portable. If you want to know more about the author and his incredible work, I would also suggest you go to his website at www.benheck.com."
2,not a good single,"The title track speaks for itself... awesome.Jerry garcias finger is the backing sound from alive in the superunknown, pointless release really. Cd 2 gives you actual songs, tracks as follows for that release1. Pretty Noose2. Applebite3. An UnkindInterview with Eleven's Alain and Natasha"
3,Standard,"My husband ordered these for our Baby Jogger City Micro. They aren't very cushiony, a bit firm but the kids don't seem to mind at all."
5,Quite possibly the best Troma film I've ever watched,"It actually isn't really much of a movie so much as it is a bunch of funny bits varying in humor, the longest of which being a little over half an hour. Mild gore and nudity nothing horribly offensive with the exception of a commercial about a prosthetic penis (one of the funniest parts). A recurring skit about a man with four multiple personalities. A mock horror movie. And many many other short bits."
3,"Works well, but the fragrance is AWFUL!","I purchased a bottle of this cleanser to try because my regular facial cleanser (St. Ives Clear Pore Cleanser) is no longer available. The product is a pale brown color and works well, but it smells awful! The fragrance reminds me of paint thinner. I purchased Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Sunflower, Green Tea, and Tea Tree Oil Face Wash (which was about half the price of this)and find it works much better and the fragrance is very nice. My recommendation--unless you want to put something that stinks on your face, go with Desert Essence!"
4,Great set,"Bought this set for my mother in law, she loved it. Great quality, color is beautiful. Transaction was great, I received the product as expected."
3,Damaged Goods,"Very attractive set. But, we purchased it at a retail outlet store and found one of the bowls to be unrepairably cracked, suggesting quality control problems."
4,Dante's Inferno for the crime generation,Mike Lester's book reminded me of that time in Iponema when I nearly lost it (control of my body that is). A pure delight to read form cover to cover.Giallo all the way.
4,"Nice lamp, useful","The lamp is good quality, but it's about two inches shorter than I'd like, which is a personal preference. I knew the height when I bought it. It's of very good quality, well-made; but it can't be positioned 'straight up', as my other lamps of similar style. Hence four stars instead of five. It also comes in red and blue, but apparently you can't get those colors on Amazon. I chose white, as that makes the light brighter.Oh: it comes WITH A BULB, thank you! Lamp socket is rated up to 100 watts with a conventional bulb, and also can hold the spiral bulbs (the 23=100 watt spiral bulb is shipped with the lamp). That's nice, THANK YOU."
4,Van Zandt County/Mills,"A bit dated and doesn't include a lot of communities, but an excellent source on early Van Zandt County. Of particular interest is the chapter on Indian Life by Mr. Wilson. He was my great uncle and his collection of Indian artifacts ended up at the Buckhorn Saloon in San Antonio--alas! They didn't keep records of acquisitions that far back. Many of the places he mentioned are now under water--either Lake Tawakoni or city lakes."
1,Not this author's best work,"Robert L. Glass writes well and usually has something interesting and useful to say, but he wrote only 15% of the pages in this book. The rest of it is articles from publications such as the Wall Street Journal, CIO Magazine, Information Week, Global Technology Business, and Business Week. If you're a regular reader of these publications, as I am, much of this book is quite literally old news. The lack of original material is a disappointment."
2,Disappointing rehash,"Most of the book is old articles copied from the trade press, with no effort to follow up! One would very much like to know what actually went wrong in these case studies of failure, but the author never exerts himself to find out.In addition the author's prose is filled with redundancies, as if it had never been edited."
4,a must have!,"this is a fabulous book for times when you are down, or clueless. have read it over a dozen times and everytime it has something new to offer me. i recommend it wholeheartedly!"
4,Magnific!!,"This symphony is the best that i have from Glass.Es una obra fantastica. Tiene fuerza, ritmo, vida. Muy recomendable."
4,Nice to discover!,"Unlike most of the comments so far I was not that much impressed by ""The Light"", but the first and third movements are very nice. Not knowing much from Glass's music, I definetely like the The Cival Wars: Interlude No.2. This CD made me somehow think about Arvo Part's Fratres."
1,master of vacuity and simplemindedness,"I was in Tower Records; little did I know I heard this excerpt,I said that must be a Disney Score, Micky Mouse must be the star for anew film conconction to make Big Bucks, it was Glass, this symphony,What! What is it?,horrible predictable orchestrations, ..., face it! Listening to it twice means you don't have a life. Boredom sets in just after one minute for me, and most,musically there is nothing there but bleak content masquerading as serious music, and I'm not an elitist. I'd rather listen to Howard Shore, or Bernard Hermann than Glass, they were more craftsmen and serious on their art. Glass is a recipe maker, washed up, trashed out and boring.But don't take my word for it."
1,Need a sedative?Look no further.,"In the large discography of Glass' works only Glassworks rises above the dreary vacuousness of this,and most, of glass' cds.It is not that Glass doesn't occasionally come up with an interesting theme but that he runs the theme into the ground.Along with Reich,Part,Adams and the other minimalists,it has dawned on me that minimalism is an apt word for the music and its composers:minimally interesting music churned out by minimally talented composers;impoverishment of inspiration dressed up as high art.Quite a concept!"
5,Into The Light,"This symphony was a step in the right direction for Glass, and so were the accompanying works. I find this album utterly blissful to listen to. Don't be so hard on The Light...not only is it the musical personification of minimalism as I understand it (moreso than the rest of the works on the album), but it also has a certain Glassy edge to it -- I become entangled in this increasingly intense web of flittering near-melodies, to the point where I cannot expel it from my mind, and soul."
5,Michaels at her best!,"This is my favorite Michaels' book. The creepy old house, the mystery surrounding the old woman and her maliciousness, the ruined love affair rekindled, and the archaeological dig combine to make a great story. A reader who reviewed this book was disappointed that the ending was left up in the air; it was the perfect ending in my opinion - it literally sent chills down my spine!"
3,Not as good as I hoped -- a disappointment,"I have read many of Barbara Michaels' books and enjoyed most. This book, however, lacked the suspense and excitement that most of her other books have. This book was quite a disappointment. After reading the blurb on the back of the book, I expected there might be a ghostly element to this story. There was absolutely no ghostly element at all. If a good Barbara Michaels ghost story is what you want, read ""Ammie Come Home"" - a spectacularly thrilling ghost story. If you want a simple mystery that is predictable from the start, read this one."
3,Barbara Michaels Be Buried in the Rain,"The Book was well writen,but in the telling was not that great.The story needed to be better told, needed more detail.The ending was just left out in the air. I would buy more of her books. she needs to give more details."
3,Interesting,"This cd is very interesting. It has the type of sick, twisted humor that you would expect from the television characters: Ren and Stimpy. It's a cd to listen to when you are in an inmature mood because these songs are sang by imature characters to create a laugh."
1,makes me SICK!,"this is probably one of the most pointless CD's i've ever seen. i LOVE Ren and Stimpy; it's one of my favorite shows, and definately the funniest. but this CD is not at all like Ren and Stimpy. where's the sidesplitting laughter that you find in the show? there is none! all i found in these songs was crap! there is nothing good to listen to on this CD!! the songs are boring, stupid, and they sound like someone found them in a dumpster. anyone who buys this CD who is not retarded will be extremely disappointed with this garbage!"
3,It would give me so much joy to play my favorite song.,"This was the third and last album based on the cartoon charactersRen & Stimpy. The storyline is about Ren & Stimpy winning a contest to be DJs at a mobile radio station. The travel the country having misadventures. There are 12 songs based on whatever they happen to be doing, with dialogue in between the songs. The album is somewhat amusing, but not the funniest Ren & Stimpy product ever. It's really only for serious Ren & Stimpy fans."
4,Needs an update,"This is a smart book. Dealing with the quality gurus, their impact on post-war Japan and the subsequent quality movement(s) in the U.S., it's a must read for every worker, manager, and executive. Quality is a must in any business. The only drawback is that the authors need to update it."
5,"""LOVE at First Gloss""","I started using this product a month before my vacation to Negril. I came back with ""NEW LIPS"". Need I say more??? Addicted."
4,Good product for the money,"For the price, this is not a bad item. The plastic sheet covering the screen will probably not last long. Looks like it will scratch or get dirty before the rest of the case wears out. Out of all the products I looked at for my phone though, this one fits the best and still lets me use the camera without having to remove it from the case!"
4,Krusell-W810i,The case design appears to be thought out very well. I like the accessibility to the controls and the access to the connector. The case is a little on the stiff side and I have to wipe off excessive glue that comes off of the case.
4,Not bad,"I feel this case does its job to an extent. My w810i fits inside like a glove and covers almost the entire outline of the phone. The quality also feels very good and sturdy. I like that there is a cutout for the middle walkman buttons but, because of this, it attracts a lot of dust into the case (especially around the lower part of the phone screen) if you leave it in your pocket or in an area that attracts a lot of dust. I have to take my phone out of the case to wipe the dust out. It's not a big deal but I prefer to keep my phone in the case at all times. Speaking of taking the phone out of the case, if you want to change the memory stick you need to take the phone out of the case as there is no cutout for the memory stick slot (maybe to provide more protection for the phone). You also need to unbutton the case if you want to take pictures or use the flashlight function. This is strange considering there are cutouts for everything else. Overall, it's a good case with minor setbacks."
5,Great Phone Case,I had a cheap generic case that holds any phone but had go get a new one cause it couldn't hold up with the phone in it. The Krusell case is so awesome and easy for using all the functions on your phone. This product is great.
2,"Works, But Not The Best Quality","I bought the Krusell Active Multidapt to protect my Sony Ericson from falls, scratches, etc. It did the job, and I used it for about 2 years.Pro'sProtected the phone very well.Con'sThe plastic that covers the screen and keys is cheaply made and began cracking from everyday use. Takes away from the sleek look of the phone and makes it look bulky and not as attractive. You have to open a flap on the back to use the camera if I am remembering correctly.Overall its not a bad protective case, but I would buy something different next time.Read my reviews - Buy with confidence"
2,Not worth using,"After a couple of days of fiddling with this case, I tossed it in the box of other non-working stuff in the basement. The flip-cover on the back pops open way too easily, and the fact that the belt clip mounts to this cover makes it virtually unusable. Slight movement such as walking makes it pop open and hang out from the belt.The design is unimaginative, and contrary to the description, the item I received contains no leather -- rubbery plastic only. If they had placed the clip mount towards the bottom of the phone, it would hang upside down -- a bit odd-looking perhaps, but far more functional because it would (a) be visible/readable without fully unclipping it, (b) place no stress on the camera lens protective cover, and (c) would be about 3-4mm thinner. As it is, there's no real reason to keep this case, even if the removable clip itself is rugged and well-designed."
1,Worst ever,"The buttons that snap this thing together come apart every time I get into my car or bend over to pick something up. It looks pretty cool and slim in the picture, but it makes the phone incredibly fat. The clip does not have enough of a reverse hook (for lack of a better term) and sometimes slides up my belt and the phone falls off completely. I suppose it doesn't cost too much, that's really the only thing good about it."
2,too bulky & stitches started to give out..,within a couple of months. Defeats the purpose of buying a W810i (sleek and fits into pockets). Would not buy again.
4,An absolute necessity,"Its a good and tough one for careless people like me . But the phone becomes a bit bulky, wish it was made of some finer material. Otherwise pretty good product."
4,Revision,"Me parece un buen forro, a pesar que es un poco pesado, protege muy bien al telefono. Lo unico dque deja que desear en la calidad de los broches metalicos, ya que uno se partio a los pocos dias de uso"
2,Not worth it,"I bought the Krussell case to protect my new W810i. The cover was so loose that the phone kept twisting around in it, blocking the keys on the right side. There is no access to the memory stick port, you have to uncase the phone to change it out. The flap that covers the camera snaps to the top so you have to be very careful taking pictures or your phone will hit the floor. I stopped using it and it sits on a shelf."
2,Case pops open too easily,"We ordered these and we liked them when we recieved them, but the snap does indeed pop open way too easily. We had to return them to the seller."
3,"Not bad, could be better.","There weren't too many choices in looking for a case for my w810i. This seemed like the best of few. The case does fit the phone almost perfectly with all buttons visible (although sometimes difficult) to reach. The case does what it is designed to do, which is to protect the phone. The only real negative that I can point out is that the case makes the phone very bulky. Keep that in mind when you purchase this phone. If you plan on wearing it on your belt then understand that it will stick out very prominently. It may not matter if you always tuck your shirt in as much. But if you don't, then you will see a noticeable bulge and it will get caught on your shirt often. Otherwise the protection and the accessibility of this case is worth it."
3,Okay,"It is an okay case. I think it is a bit bulky. If you clip it on your belt, it sticks out pretty far. There is not many case options for this phone, but when a new one comes out, I will check it out. Also, kinda made me angry when I got this brand new item, it had glue residue all over it, which transfered to me! Took a long time to get it off me, the case, and the phone!"
5,I like this case!,"I was worried about my new Sony w810i phone getting scratched or dropped. I ordered this case and am very pleased with it's fit and craftmanship. The holes line up perfectly and I can dial the buttons fairly easy through the plastic. It's a tight fit and getting it to snap is a little tough, but once it's in snug you're good to go. I have not found anything more suitable for my needs."
4,Awesome gloves,"I love these gloves, they keep my hands safe and give me a lot of grip. I wish they were a little smaller though,they are just a tad roomy for my hands, but they are a great value and work well in my garden."
4,An excellent collection,This is a wonderful collection of Mythology from all over the world. It is very useful in determining common threads of myth in different socieities...
3,Informative but not an easy read,"This book is informative but the writing is excruciatingly boring. I am reading it aloud to my son who has it as a text for a college mythology class. He is severely dyslexic, so I'm reading it to him. I have done this with him for years. Never have we had a book that is so hard to enjoy, so hard to stay awake through, whether on the reading side or listening side. I would have given it less than a three, but it does have the information. I apologize to the author; I just can't recommend it."
1,I don't think many arabs and Muslims will buy this!,"An article in this book, entitled ""The Great War on Militant Islam"" by Andrew McCarthy, is very alarming. Not only is the inaccuracy of the article disturbing, but also the language used in reference to Arabs and Muslims is extremely racist. Below is an excerpt from the text.""Christianity and Judaism in particular - regard themselves, like Islam regards itself, as a final, divinely revealed truth. Yes, they too proselytize, and they have their occasional religiously motivated murderers. But those are aberrational and instantly condemned by the rest of the faithful. On the Planet Earth today, only Islam sports an unbridled faction that systematically inculcates hatred, systematically dehumanizes non-adherents, and systematically kills massively and indiscriminately.""Page 143Surely if the editors allow this sort of thing to get through, then the rest of us must question the validity of other articles in the rest of the book!"
5,NOT 'A' BAD?,".Bunny Wailer's Blackheart Man is spactacular.It doesnt get much better than this, as far as reggae is concerned. The arrangement, lyrical content, musicianship,and vocal harmonies, are an insperation. Mek we talk bout bunny and not so much bob. seen? good. As a musician and singer, I could only HOPE to ever acheive the sounds on this record, as I know it can never be done gain. truth. peace."
3,Wonderful sound let down only by the material and style,"If the other reviewers are to be believed, Bunny Livingston has been overlooked by us Bob Marley fans. Not quite true. Brash it may seem, the themes are undoubtedly Marley-esque but the melodies are much weaker by the same comparison.On the other hand, you will like it a lot if you like Burning Spear, as about half the songs on this album are from this mould (or did Bunny come first, not sure?). Too wishy-washy for me. The best things about this album are definitely Bunny's voice and the second to none quality of the sound. I can't take that away.If you want a really good album that you can get your teeth into, the Abyssinians' Satta Massagana will hit (sorry, pound) the mark - guaranteed. I bet my house you'll prefer this one.My reggae repoitoire so far includes Black Uhuru (3-4/5), Congos (3-4/5), Pioneers (3.5/5), Abyssinians (5/5), Marley (5/5), so as you can see I have some reference points."
5,A Great Debut For This Former Wailer,I think in contrast to Bob Marley's first solo album Natty Dread this is more well rounded and consistant. One listen to Blackheart Man and you will be sucked in by Bunny's rythms and beautifull voice along with his easy going style. A must have to all reggae fans.
4,Typical zodiac placemat,These are exactly what you would find at a Chinese Restaurant. I would have liked to know the years that were included on the placemat. example 1940-2010. A little more description would have been helpful. Luckily the birth years I needed were on these placemats.
4,Zodiac Place Mats,"The placemats are great, however, they were a little faded. I have seen other placemats where the red and gold border had richer, bolder color. That was the only disappointment with the product."
1,Wouldn't Hold a Charge,while I was glad to promptly receive my battery it had one BIG problem. It wouldn't hold a charge. It's basically useless. I would not suggest buying this particular brand.
1,DO NOT BY THIS IF YOU LIVE ANYWHERE WHERE IT RAINS!,This cover was a sorry waste of money. It leaked the very first time we had a minor rain shower. The water pooled up in the middle of the chair and soaked right through the cover and thouroghly soaked the cushion underneath. It is not waterproof or weather proof.
4,Very interesting......,"I really enjoyed this book. It covers the entire Arhnem operation through British eyes. The author goes from one personal account of the action to another,which blends into a great tapestry of the battle. The only drawbacks I could comment on is the action is not fluid, Middlebrook will cover one area of the battle (e.g. Arnhem Bridge), in its entirety, and jump back (in time) to another section (Middlebrook tells of a British battalion dropped in the second lift being detailed to join in the push to the bridge, then later tells us of the second lift in which it arrived). The other is the lack of detail on the Polish cause in the battle. Overall very easy to read and enjoyable. A great companion when read with other MARKET-GARDEN books of broader (Ryan's a Bridge Too Far) and differing viewpoints (It Never Snows In September, the German point of view, Poles Apart,the Polish view). A must for any MARKET GARDEN reader."
4,Reggae with a harder edge,"Good music with a harder edge than Marley or Isaacs. This isn't party music with songs like Dry and Heavy, Slavery Days, Ghost"
3,fit well... only lasted a year,"Water resistant... hmmm.... well maybe for a few sprinkles, but once the water leaks through it consistantly does.The weather got to this cover and it only lasted one season.We are using a tarp this winter and it seems to be doing the job just as well."
4,Very Good for the money,"This cover is great for the money.However I am probably more of a nit picker than most.It has a good fit, and keeps light rain out.However in a downpour this leaks pretty bad."
2,Nice Disposable Cover,This cover is about as nice as could be expected for what it cost I guess. It kept the leaves and dust out of my boat for one off-season. Then apparently the U.V. got to it and it would tear easily when trying to pull it snug and at any pressure points like seat backs or downrigger mounts.If you just want a temporary cover to last until you can save for something more expensive this cover is for you.
1,Cut-and-paste at its laziest,"For many years, this was the only biography of the renowned actor/gourmet cook/art authority, and if you don't know anything at all about Vincent Price, it might suffice. I bought it when it first came out, but even then I recognized it as basically a cut-and-paste job (literally -- the text blocks sit askew on some pages like they were manually pasted up in someone's dining room) culled from any number of press sources that gives precious little insight into Price, as either a man or an actor. Worse, the write-ups of his films are so smugly dismissive that one wonders why the authors bothered publishing a book about a figure they clearly seem to disdain. This book is a prime example of the kind of slipshod 1970s ""film journalism"" that thankfully is no longer acceptable for publication."
4,Catholic social teaching,"This book on Catholic social teaching should be in every educated person's home. It is a great place to start on understanding why capitalism and socialism both fail. Written almost a century ago, its insights are valuable for us today who see both systems failing us."
2,doesn't put out 70W,"I bought this to have another power brick for my Powerbook.It is very lightweight and looks nice. However, it does NOT put out thenecessary 65W for a 15"" or 17"" Powerbook. System Profiler shows it asa 45W power supply. If all you need is 45W, it is very light and has aan iPod dock connector charger as well. I should also note that the oneI got had a power tip for the Powerbook that was quite loose -- it had tobe wiggled just right to even get the 45W."
1,Worthless adaptor,"I bought this power adaptor without checking the Amazon feedback first. After all, how hard is it to make a decent power adaptor? Big mistake!!! This is NOT a 70W adaptor, and won't power up my powerbook if the battery charge level is < 40%. The connection is loose, and no led indicator like the Apple one does. All in all, a worthless brick."
5,This book really touched my heart ~,"You don't need to be a grandparent to appreciate the love and thought that Mr. Heston put into writing this book for his grandson. His words of wisdom, his life lessons and his family values are valuable and extremely well-written. His grandson, Jack, is one lucky little boy to have such a wonderful and caring grandfather."
2,Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat,I purchased this car seat for my granddaughter and use it 2 - 3 times a week. I find the hooks difficulty to open when a child is in it. I don't have the patience and time to deal with it with a nine month old also in the car. The seat itself is fine and easy to attach to the car itself.
2,Poor attachments,"Although the seat itself is very nice, I was extremely disappointed in the way it attached to the vehicle. The way the straps fastened and tightened was very unsatisfactory. The buckles did not tighten securely and the the release mechanism was frustrating at best. Look for better attachments!!"
4,My daughter loves this seat,I would definitely recommend this booster seat. I searched all over for a seat that had all the features I wanted for a great price. I haven't used the cupholder yet but my daughter loves the armrests and she moves them up and down alot. I bought a second one for our other car because I liked how easy the shoulder straps are to adjust. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because sometimes the straps do get twisted and the recline feature is so so.
3,Establishing a Direction,"This is the album that established a personality for Harper. Despite the usual standout tracks, this album lacks a lot of steam and flow that some of Roy's other releases have. It hasn't stood the test of time terribly well, nor is it a very chic relic from the past. Sgt. Sunshine and Exercising Some Control are my picks on this one, though a lot of Harper fans point to McGoogan's Blues. Although Harper apparently has mixed emotions about it, I find the release previous to this, Come Out Fighting Ghengis Smith, far superior."
3,Folkjokeopus,Folkjokeopus being the 3rd studio album by Roy Harper and was released 1969 is a straight forward late 60's rock album with fair lyrics to go with it. The sound is very eclectic and hard to define but could be said to be a mix between experimental and folk rock. The booklet is quit odd with a picture of Harper with a monkey on his shoulder. The booklet has no lyrics but linernotes that are quite strange. 3/5.
4,A couple of gems,"Being the first Roy Harper LP I purchased I have an emotive attachment to it, however, while it may not be his best or most consistent work it does contain a couple of superb tracks. ""Seargeant Sunshine"" (yes, spelled ""Seargeant"") a worthy and energetic opener is followed by my personal favourite ""She's the One"" featuring a vocal performance brimming with hostile emotion. Side two boasts the majestic ""McGoohan's Blues"" (my vinyl copy cleary states ""McGoohan's"") a sprawling epic of a song. Interspersed are some fabulously silly songs. Classic Roy Harper this is not, but the album is exclusively acoustic and has enough highlights to make it a worthy addition to your Harper collection."
3,for golfers,"This is definitely a game only enjoyed by golfers. My fiance loves the arcade version so I got him this....he likes it, it's no Wii/PSP but it's a lot cheaper."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this from Target and wish I hadn't now. The images on the box are deceiving. I think Atari or orginal Nintendo may have had better graphics than this! It's not even close to the game you'd play at the local tavern or bowling alley. What a waste of money, hope you don't waste yours on this too because you will be GREATLY disappointed!"
1,Not golden tee,"I am now the laughing stock of my friends, why because I payed money for the lamest excuse of a 8 bit console tv plug and play ever. My atari plug and play has better graphics and feel than this. There are bars that have the projected GTEE screen that makes the game all most real I feel my little tv had to much resolution for this toy making it feel not so real in fact in two words ""it sucks""."
4,"Fun, but not close to the version in bars","I bought this for myself and was hoping that it would be similar to the version I play out with the guys occasionally. The game has some differences and the graphics are not close, but its really inexpensive so that is not a shock. What was surprising is that my 5 and 6 year old boys were all over it, which required them to learn the rules of golf. They had a ball. When I do get to play I do enjoy it."
2,"get the Jakks Pacific version, this one stinks","I suppose for a game based on 20+ year old tech it's not so bad, but compared to the Jakks Pacific version of Golden Tee this thing stinks. Only one course, even worse graphics, no announcer, no scoreboard, no memory, NO FUN. Skip this. The JP version is the ACTUAL original arcade version of Golden Tee and is superior in every way.I've given mine to Goodwill already after one round."
1,"Cheap Junk, Stay Away","You'll put your computer at risk if you place it on top of this cheap, wobbly desk. Look for a better, sturdier solution."
