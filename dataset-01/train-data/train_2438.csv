4,"Honest, truthful and uplifting","What I enjoyed most about this book is the way Patti described her own personal moments as she gives the pearls of wisdom. You will not only get some ""right on"" pieces of wisdom, but Patti will tell the ups and downs in her own life as she began to appreciate the very messages she's sharing. I am already familiar with some of the messages she shares(serenity prayer, for example), but this book will give you a fresh view of some time honored truths. If you are a true Patti fan (and who isn't?) you will be familiar with a few of the stories she shares, but those were life changing moments in her life and the lessons learned should be told again and again. One of Patti's pearls that I just love is ""You Don't Need A Certain Number Of Friends, Only A Number Of Friends You Can Be Certain Of""..Pick this up for yourself and the teenagers in your life."
3,better than i expected,"I don't expect much out of a celebrity bio but darn this turned out to be much better than I ever imagined. Patti Labelle lays her wisdom on the line. I enjoyed the book, took inspiration from it and learned a few things. Even if you aren't a Patti fan (I'm not) you will enjoy this highly moving but slim book."
1,"Weak, WEAK. Wish I hadn't spent the money.","I bought this book based on all the (11) great reviews it had - I am now convinced that most of those reviews were written by friends/relatives of the author. I hate to be so critical as I'm sure someone put serious effort into this, so let me be perfectly clear here: I would NOT be writing this review if I didn't feel like I had been duped into thinking it was a good book. The idea was neat, but the book itself is terribly boring. TERRIBLY. Boring. I imagine if I myself tried to write a ghost novel, it would turn out something like this - which is to say, poorly. The writing was unengaging & anything but subtle. The dialogue, character ""development"", and attempts at humor all made me either roll my eyes or fall asleep. Rarely have I cared less about a set of characters. I slogged through about half of this before I gave up; it was a relief to put this aside.I guess the lesson I learned from this: Don't believe a small set of rave reviews."
4,Breaking the Rules,"""Breaking the rules"" has a double meaning. First, I never critique writers efforts - who am I to judge - and second, Mr. Colander's book DOES break some existing ""rules"". Just what those rules are is why I'm breaking rule #1 and suggesting that you buy this book. I've been reading novels of this genre' for decades and it's a refreshing change of pace from the norm. I'm sure that you'll echo my thought: ""Boy, I didn't see that coming!"""
2,Mostly Show,"This is a beautiful system but it is more show than go. I didn't expect much in terms of sound quality so I'm not that disappointed.I AM very disppointed regarding the built quality. Within two weeks the remote sensor quit working. Sony authorized service center is just a joke. Took the system to 4 different service center and they either said they can't fix it or they are not ""authorized to fixed this model"". One service center even asked me ""what is a home theater syste"" over the phone.Star rating on the speaker: 3 starsSony customer service and built quality: 0 star.I'll be nice and round the average up to 2 stars.For $999, you are better off getting"
2,Damaged Product,Like most of the other folks i too got the stuff half broken. Most of the plastic pieces on the top hood and on the legs were bad broken. I returned the stuff back immediately and asked for refund.I would suggest that you go to Fry's or something and get one there for 10 more bucks may be.
1,Manufacture Defects,"Be careful with this one, my first one was broken and the replacement I received from Amazon was broken too. Both defects are in the same place. On the lower legs, the plastic feet were broken and cracked, this defect kept the legs from locking. This was NOT Amazon's fault, nor did it occur during shipping, this was a Kodak problem. After my second one came broken, Amazon refused to replace it, they would just credit my account, which I have not seen yet. If you buy it, I hope you have better luck than I did."
1,Cheap Junk,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. Like the other person mine also came broken and when I went to open it up another piece of plastic shot off. Shame on Kodak for selling junk. Watch out they are getting rid of their German lenses (select cameras) and going with something else. I can not say whether or not there quality is going to be any lower but looking at their tripod you can never tell.
1,Broken and missing parts,"I don't know if this is the standard for this tripod, or just the seller I purchased from on Amazon! The camera attachment plate is missing, so there is NO way to attach the camera to the tripod - which kind of defeats the whole purpose. It is flimsy, and one of the clips did not secure the leg. Another plastic clip broke the second time I opened it!"
3,A little funky,"My first impressions of this stand were great. It came very well packaged and it felt very sturdy. However, after I screwed my camera (kodak dx6440) on the top, I noticed that the camera did not feel very well attached to the tripod. After the camera was screwed on, it was able to lean from one side to the other, making it near impossible for me to get a non-blurry or a level picture at higher exposures."
3,Not As Good As I Remembered,"I read most of these stories when they were first published, many of them in the New Yorker, and loved them. Maybe it's because I was younger, but when new the stories impressed me enormously, both for their plots and Adams's writing style. This time around, most of them left me cold; they were mannered and remote in comparison to today's stories. I suppose Adams's writing is simply out of style, but it came as a huge surprise."
2,An 80s View of San Franciscans,"Adams, Alice, Rich Rewards. New York: Alfred Knopf, 1980.Alice Adams published dozens of stories and novels about women alone, but this one seems to have been dashed off without much thought. We follow the first person narrator, Daphne, from her twenty-something affair with a Frenchman, Jean-Paul, through many years of this and that, not amounting to much. She becomes an interior decorator in San Francisco and is enmeshed with a family in rapid disintegration. She is robbed, struck by a man, befriends gays, does some work, but her emotional state is neutral. The reader could care less. The climax comes when word of Jean-Paul's visit to the U.S. arrives and Daphne goes to pieces after having no contact for twenty years. Why? Pretty unconvincing, was my verdict."
3,Takes Practice,"I only used this through one batch. It takes a little practice to get the dough & filling measurement just right for this process. Overall this model turned out to be a little too small to be worth it for me, but I'll be getting the next size up soon!"
1,Too Academic,This book is fine if you are interested in a purely academic approach. This offers nothing for practitioners.
3,for X-men fans only,"The best parts of the game are the short movie segments in between the acutal game-play. The game itself is not terribly exciting or fun to play, but if you're a big X-men fan, then it's probably worth a few hours of your time."
3,"Good, but Justice League is better.","This game has a more ""real"" look than the first, although I thought the cell shading in the first one made it easier to see what was going on. I made it through this game about halfway and then tried Justice League and never went back. Why? Larger characters on the screen were easier to see, being able to pick up objects to hit enemies with (Wonder Woman smashing the bad guy with a toilet FTW!), and levels that don't drag on too long all added up to a better game.If you are a hardcore X-Men fan than you'll be very happy, but you'll have more fun with JL."
4,WOO!,"This game is great. I hadn't played my PSP for about three months until I got this (I don't like racing games). I was even thinking of trading it in, but thanks to this game and GTA I'm glad I held on to it. This game even includes the system update. For all of us super comic nerds there are hidden comics in the game that open comic book levels and hidden characters ( X-man!). This game is sweet!"
4,Sirius Radio-To-Go,"The XACT Power Pod is not the most sophisticated and sleek piece of technology you will ever own, but it does the job of letting you take your Sirius receiver away from your home/car. I brought mine to Florida on my last vacation. I was able to bring my radio out onto the beach and listen to Radio Margaritaville for about 3 hours on a charge (needed to connect a pair of powered speakers of course). Just enough time to get a nice sunburn. I have recently purchased the boombox for the XACT so the pod will probably be collecting dust in my closet.Pros: Long listening time per charge, relatively small, good antenna positioning, battery gague.Cons: Unless you want to use it with headphones buy the boombox, a bit pricey."
1,A Waste of Money,"I purchased this book and attempted to find something that would apply to my needs as a minority and it was a big disappointment! It has nothing that can be used by anyone that is seeking help especially a minority, I don't suggest this to anyone!"
1,An information source with WRONG phone numbers.,"As an information source I find this book unsatisfactory since the telephone numbers for Regional and District offices of the Small Business Association are either incorrect, disconnected or no other information is available. I spent more money than I paid for the book calling information to try to get the correct phone numbers. Do yourself a favor and don't buy the book. You are better off on your own."
1,No Free Money!!!!!!!,"I have been a small business consultant for years and have followed up on many of the claims about ""guaranteed"" sources for grants and start-up money from government and other sources. If you are starting a for-profit business unless you have a new technology of interest to the government or are creating a significant number of new jobs in a depressed area, there is very little possibility of obtaining a grant. Most are far better off putting their time and resources into planning and starting up their business than pursuing grants and spending money on books, lists and other meida like this claiming to have the ""secret"" to getting free money. Most, like this, only provide lists and links to places to apply for grants which do not apply to the vast majority of people. Save your money and go see your local Small Business Development Center from some real free assistance in starting a business."
1,I totally agree with all the other complaints,"Since you can tell how I feel about this book based on the title of my review, I won't repeat everything that's been said by the other reviewers so far. However, I will say that, as a small business owner who tries very hard to spend money wisely, I am SO NOT HAPPY that I spent close to $20 for this book that is of absolutely no value to me. I don't want to throw it away, but I certainly can't see where anybody would want to buy it if I re-sold it. This book was a total waste of money--if there were a 0-star rating, I'd give it that without hesitation."
2,Pornlord of the Rings,"I'm sure that there's a world where in 100 years, students writing scholarly dissertations about fantasy novels will come across this book and address it as a fine example of subgenre. At that point, it may gain cult status, who knows?I had to give this book one extra star for sheer creativity-- whether it was the farm-wife who was (*ahem*) extra-close to her sheep or whether it was the cruddy curse of the human king, Cullen clearly doesn't have a problem with his imagination.The plot was tedious, nothing more than an excuse to feature the various anatomical ways that elves, dwarves, deer, sheep, humans, and chickens (this is not an exaggeration) can interact. Even the erotica had very little virtue except a clearly vivid imagination behind it.Champions of the very strange may get something out of this."
3,Common Grasses of SE Pennsylvania,"Easy to use. Focuses on the most common grasses of the region. Sketches are well done although not higly detailed, and provides moderate descriptions but no pictures of plant parts useful for identification."
1,no,"normally i dont do a review unless i like something about the product. talk about killing your reputation... beam vs cyrus have put out some of the best singles and remixes in the past few years, but who talked them into doing this? are you serious? please no. i really hope they can redeem themselves after this.tragic."
4,More than skin deep,"Second Skin is a lyrical, difficult but ultimately rewarding novel. It focuses on Skipper, the narrator, who simply tries to survive a series of life tragedies ranging from being the victim of a mutiny to losing his wife and daughter to suicide.To say these things is not to give away the plot. Because Skipper does not tell his story in a linear fashion, we know what will happen from the beginning. The pleasure is in listening to the narrative voice tell his ""naked history"" (as Skipper calls it).John Hawkes is an under-appreciated writer and a brilliant prose stylists. For anyone who loves to read beautiful sentences, this book is highly recommended."
4,"Not the best game ever made, but definitly worth buying.","I bought this game for the two payer part. I was dissapointed with it, since the secongp player can do nothing but attack. No magic, no items,ect. However, I soon found out that the two player mode is still a heck lot of fun! And the single player game is great too. Though frusterating at first, the game grows on you. If your a Final Fantasy fan, you'll love this game! Many cameo apperances from all our favorite FF charecters. Heck, it even has Ultros from Final Fantasy 6! This game is definitly worth getting."
4,Chocobo's Dungeon 2,"This is a fun game. Very addictive. Sometimes the CG scenes get a little annoying-- especially for someone who is impatient, like me. ;-) Starting out in a new dungeon each time is both fun and frustrating. The only problem I have with it is with saving the game. There are times when the phone rings or I have to go someplace but I can't just save and come back to it later. I think you should be able to save more often. Especially when your area is prone to power-outs. Mixing the weapons and armor is pretty neat! Lots of fun stuff to do in this game. Cute graphics too. I love Squaresoft!"
4,Surprisingly addictive,"I thought Chocobo's Dungeon 2 was going to be a medicore effort from the makers of SquareSoft. Of course, things took a change, and I started to love this game. This game is basically set upon dungeons, which are incredibly tedious at first, but once you know how to use magic, feathers, and other such things, you'll grow on it. The only bad part is that it can be annoying when you keep dying. Oh well, 'cause this is a GREAT effort, and worth any money."
5,GREAT,"This brings into light many upon many truths about our great society. Obviously, when you are trying to get your point across, the data would only show for the purpose to support your point, as did this film. BUT, nonetheless it is riveting to see what the media ACTUALLY does in its true nature of practice. I have shown this to my women's group and they absolutely love it. I would recommend this to EVERYONE - man and women, old and young!!"
5,Great Movie!,"Great Movie. I think everyone needs to watch this movie. Everyone. It's both enlightening and very interesting to watch. Jean Kilbourne is a great speaker on behalf of women's rights, I am glad to see she was in this documentary."
2,Uses exploitation all its own...,"In concept, highlighting how women are demeaned by mass media is a worthwhile message. Oddly, 'Miss Representation' seems to mimic the same approach in its delivery. I can understand why including some footage of exploitative media might serve to illustrate the problem, but 'MR' seems compelled to periodically fill the screen with over-long sequences of women doing the very things 'MR' decries. I got the feeling that the producers felt the need to 'keep things interesting' and inserted a bunch of provocative footage to keep the audience engaged. God forbid we just see people talking about the problem. Better yet, why not have most of the inserted footage showing positive women role models?I would skip this video, for sure."
5,Must see film!!!,"This film is carefully crafted and written, very real portrayal of how images in media affect girls as they grow up. Every parent should see this. Every student should see this although it's not really appropriate for younger children below middle school. If this film doesn't move you, seek help."
5,Good representation,The product was excellent and arrived in a timely manner. Outstanding documentary. My college class watched and enjoyed. Will continue to use as part of my syllabus.
1,Grotesque distortion of the truth,"The film is biased to a risible degree. Sadly, there is no effort to show young women the importance of transcending media images and asserting one's independence. Also, even the treatment of the media suffers from the obvious use of a familiar ruse-- the half-truth. Anyone can cherry pick images and come up with any conclusion they desire about what the media is conveying to us. Sadly, there is a message here that is worth sending to young women, who we must not let fall victim to ridiculous pop culture expectations of what they should look like. But not with a film that would blend in with a film festival of the most didactic in the ""socialist realism"" genre. It will make most young women laugh and go about their business."
1,Whatever,"This movie is a bunch of bunk. Women are their own worst enemies and until women change and stand up for each other and stop pushing Hollywood as the ""standard"" to our daughters, we will continue to go backwards. Moms and grandmothers and fathers and the church, should all be teaching self-worth to their daughters and their sons and not some movie filled with actresses who say one thing on screen yet live a hypocritical lifestyle off screen. I could never recommend a movie of this type to anyone."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ,IT'S SO HARD TO FIND THIS BOOK. WHEN I DID HAVE IT I READ OVER 10 TIMES AND I STILL WANNA READ IT. THAT'S HOW GOOD I THINK THE BOOK IS.
5,"continuous, flowing, clean, and beautiful",Sunscreem produces some of the most moving and beautiful (dance)music that you can find. This continuous mix is an essential cd to own for anyone interested in dance music. Although I consider this to be eurohouse or trance it crosses the lines of the dance music genre. Although I have to admit that in New York I have not heard too much of these wonderful songs. Buy it!!! and spread the word...
3,"""The plot development was somewhat lacking...""","A potentially promising idea, but, unfortunately, it was not well-developed at all. I can see why the last five volumes didn't sell well with this particular ghost-writer at the helm. I believe one of the other authors could have done a much better job. The characters do not ring as true as in previous volumes. In addition, too many necessary details were left unsaid, consequently, leaving the reader to provide them on his/her own. I'm afraid avid Trixie Belden fans - particularly those who prefer the older style of writing - may be disappointed with this volume. Of note, I also prefer the oval cover designs and no inside illustrations. The three star rating of this book is due simply (and only) to the fact that the subject is Trixie Belden. The large sum of money - and time - I spent on the auction block could have been put to better use, but at least now I can take comfort in the fact that my collection is complete."""
4,Rather Good,"The story was good, but I preferred the old way how the stories was wrote without the pictures. I wish there was more books out after these. I loved reading about Honey, Trixie, Jim, Dan, Di, Brian and Mart."
5,I love it!,OMG i looooove it!!!! the only thing i would like to change is that it is VERY hard to get the dividers in the second row. but thats mostley it. i overall like it! it is very sturdy and is HUGE!! it comes with 12 dividers! thats alot. plus you can rearrange the bottom with dividers also! it is like 4x's bigger than it looked in the picture!! and i am soooo glad i got it!!! it looks and probably is one of the proffesional ones and i am soooooo glad i spent the money on it becuase it was sooooo worth it!!! i am so glad i ordered it! but it took a while to get here. oh well i still love it! i am going to be adding a picture soon!
5,Worth the Money....Love it!,This case is huge for the price! It is very sturdy. I was very surprised when I opened it. It even has a lock on it.It looks very professional and sleek! This was a christmas gift for my sister ( a makeup queen).....she fell in love with it!This case is worth buying!!
4,Good Product,"I love this case and it does hold a TON of makeup. The tray sizes are able to be completely customized and even come with extra separators. The only issue I have had is with the closing tray. I feel like the quality could be better and more durable, but I'll just be sure to not be to rough with it."
3,Rating for item,"The item I received was not 24x10x10 as advertised, but 14x10.5x8.5 far from what i thought i was ordering. Box itself is nice, just not the right size."
5,Surprise!,"When I purchased this I didn't realize how much room that I have to work with. I'm so glad that I bought this because I finally found a case that holds all of my makeup. There are many compartments to seperate the different categories! I organize my makeup after so long... o_0 :) I must add, FAST SHIPPING!"
5,its great,"i love this bag, its so nice and big and it fits all my make up. i love how i can arrange all my make up in this, so when im in a rush and running late (which is a lot)i dont have to look for one item for 15 mints. its also great for those people who travel alot. the price is great for the quality so im getting one for my friend's birthday next month :)"
1,Not worth it,"Once it arrived it was broken. The hinges and in general the case is cheaply built. Not worth the money, I don't have anything good to say about this product! Do not waste your time and money!"
1,Really Bad Quality,I couldn't imagine I said ''OMG'' when I opened the case and saw inside. The quality is too bad. Only one thing made me feel better is the case is large enough.
2,Poor Quality,"This is a huge makeup train case but I found it to be of poor quality. It's hard to tell from the pictures but the interior is some cheap foam material. The separators on the inside of mine were flimsy and coming separated from the cardboard that it was glued on. I am going to end up returning this item, and spending more on something better quality."
2,Don't buy if you want something you can use everyday,"We got this because its price was low. It looks good on the picture right?After we unpack and opened it we were so very disappointed. It weights probably less than a plastic one, meaning it's really not solid and everything is loose. It doesn't close smoothly - the small racks inside does not move exactly with the cover, and falls on the bottom when you close and there is nothing that cushions the free fall so every time it just hits the grid, quite hard and makes annoying sound.If that doesn't sound too bad, opening it takes more effort. some metal parts got into each others' ways and you have to adjust it's positions carefully so they can pass each other nicely. it's supposed to make things easier to reach but when you need to grab something quick, this won't help you at all and overtime will frustrate you.the small iron pieces around the exterior look more like decorative than providing real support."
1,Not the quality one would expect. Definitely made in China,I ordered this for my daughter for christmas as a last minute idea. It came in a nice box but I thought I would check it over before I wrapped it. Thank goodness I did. It took me two bottles of super glue to put all the foam back on the dividers and trays. The metal is thin as paper and would offer no protection from anything. The shelve supports are so weak that they aren't going to last. It is just cheesey at any price. Unfortunately I have to give this to my daughter along with an appology and a promise for a better one when the holidays pass. Avoid this product at all costs unless it is for a small child to put play make-up in. It is junk and an embarrassment to give it as a gift. Not what I am used to from an Amazon vendor.
1,Do not Recommend this product,Purchased this train case and was very disappointed. It arrived broken. I had to repair the bracket which was connected to the moveable trays inside the case. The trays are very flimsey and it is practically impossible to move the adjustable inserts on the bottom trays. This case is very cheaply made and I don't expect it to last very long. Do not recommend.
3,Shoud have cost less,Plastic on the inside. Light. Shallow drawers are a disadvantage. You have to ease it closed or it jams :(
3,Great for starters,"Its a little too ""aluminum"" and flimsy for my liking. I could be wrong but I don't see the case lasting past this time next year. It is a great case for people who are just starting to keep make up around. I can see why many people are satisfied with the product however, it is a tad bit mediocre. I would spend the extra coins to buy something more sturdy."
2,Disappointed....,"Consdering that I ordered this to replace an old SHOEBOX, it says a lot that I am disappointed with this product.The outside looks nice, but opening it I saw that it's already falling apart! The compartment dividers are made of cardboard covered with some foam material that is already peeling off and the trays are flimsy and difficult to get open and closed. Very cheaply made.Also, there is a huuuge gap between the top tray and the top of the case, so you can't jostle this thing at all or the makeup will get mixed up (but I've never had a cosmetic case before, so maybe this is normal?).Overall, I would not recommend this product."
2,poor quality,"This case is hard to open and close. The shelves don't slide very easily, and I had to glue a lot of the lining back down. It's also a lot bigger than it needs to be. Most of the room is at the top of case, and the shelves aren't really deep enough to stand anything up without it just falling over. The little brand tag on the outside of the box was even attached crooked. Don't buy this box unless you want to start out with something that is already falling apart. I really wish I would have spent more money and get something a lot nicer."
5,I love it....,It is better than it looks in the Picture. It is made of good material and it is in good size and reasonable weight.
4,"Not quite worth the price, but still a great box!","For fifty dollars I was expecting something a little more sturdy. Also the movable dividers on the inside drawers on the bottom ones- if you take them out be resigned to the fact that they are not going back in (i might not be doing it right though!Besides that it's so spacious, and it even has enough room to fit my bh cosmetics 120 pallet."
4,Very nice for the price!,"Very nice for the price! There are bigger cases, but they are much more expensive. This case holds a lot and it's washable should you spill anything inside."
5,love!,"Why spend $100 on a Sephora train case when you can buy this?! I've had this for almost 3 years, and I love it. I love the compartments and that you can change the size of each of them accordingly. It's also great for travel!"
3,"Big, but a little flimsy","This is huge! I am glad I will never have to buy another box or bag for makeup because it is so big. It is kinf of flimsy and I am glad I didnt pay full price, I only paid about half. i would have felt riped off if I paid 80 buck. It is good for about 20-40 buck I think, but not 80 buck worth in my opinion. like I said to flimsy, seems like of cheeply made, but I am happy with the size and It should work great for me. Only thing is not so great for travel. I would have to get a smaller bag or box to travel with. Over all not bad. It did get here quickly and packaged well."
4,"A little shaky, but otherwise great","This box was a little shaky & the hinges didn't line up ie, I had to needle-nose plier them a bit. Other than that, it has great storage capacity & arrangement options."
2,Lots of wasted space!,"For the size of the case, there is a lot of wasted space. I wish I could lift the expandable trays out so that I can access the bottom part of the case better. The trays themselves are also badly constructed. The top tray blocks about a 1/3 of the bottom one, so you can't see what you've got in there!The quality is really bad too. It's not even plastic on the inside, it's foam covered cardboard. It looks like someone put it together at a Michael's Saturday craft class.Just about the only redeeming factor with this case is that 1) it was cheap and 2) you can adjust the length of the trays for the size of your products. But, as I mentioned, you can't readily access all of the parts of the case well.Just stick to Caboodles."
2,Good For Storage,"I bought this case knowing it was junky but big. I didn't realize just how junky it was though! The dividers are poorly-cut cardboard covered in cheap foam, which was peeling off when I got it. Parts of the aluminum also looked rusty and dirty. Despite the fact that its junk I'm going to keep it because I just need a way to bring all of my stuff back and forth from college. This is big enough to hold all of my makeup plus face-wash, makeup remover, moisturizer and all of my nail polish and a full size bottle of nail polish remover. If you are looking for quality DON'T BUY THIS CASE!"
4,Good value for the money,"You do get what you pay for, and as a storage case this works well! It is quite large, and I was able to store 80% of ""my stuff"" in one concise place. On the downside, the underneath compartments are hard to reach into, the divider in the bottom that is removable...very flimsy and doesn't fit to create four egual compartments in the bottom. I can't even see what is in one of the compartments once I had my stash in there. End results, I like it and happy I purchased it. If I were a professional makeup artist and not an individual looking for storage...this would not be ideal."
3,Norton Weighed Down!,"What a shame that these classic, indispensable star charts have been weighed down with literally 4 times as many pages of verbiage that just make it extremely clumsy at the telescope. This easily should have been 2 books!Still, 3 stars because it is Norton's with interesting objects adjacent to good charts.There is also a mis-print in the charts adjoining the North Polar chart, making it hard to find your way around. TOO BAD!"
4,Update to Norton is a winner,"This is close to the ideal beginner astronomer guide. No, it isn't ""Sky Atlas 2000.0"", but it's not meant to be. Most beginners would be totally confused by SA 2000.0's detail.Norton's Atlas has large swaths of sky covered in each map. The most important objects are clearly marked and the reference material associated with the maps helps new observers get the most out of them.However, Norton's Atlas is not just an atlas. It also contains much reference material to help the beginner understand the hows and whys. Norton may be the ideal beginning observer's guide and atlas.Note: Make sure that you order the latest edition, which is the 20th edition."
1,This item misrepresented to make a sale,"I was looking for the AC Adaptor that would operate the kodak M753camera from an electrical outlet, but what I received from A1 books inFresno, CA was an AC adaptor that will only charge the battery. There isconnectability for an AC Adaptor on the camera for operation from an electrical outlet, but the actual adaptor that would allow for this operation is impossible to find. Why would Kodak build a camera with this capability and then not build the appropriate acaptor to allow for this operation? Too, I am considering returning the camera because of the crappy reviews. Looks like Kodak is going to lose a dedicated customer."
4,Kodak 5Volt AC Adapter for my Easy Share Charger Dock,"Although I still think it was rather an expensive item, I got it cheaper here than at Kodak's site and now I can just recharge my Kodak EasyShare CX camera on its dock and save batteries.The AC adapter was well packed and new. It doesn't fit tightly in the dock (sometimes if I am moving it it will come unplugged), but if I leave it alone it works fine."
1,KODAK 5V AC ADAPTER,"Kodak 5V AC Adapter for Select DX, LS & P Series Digital CamerasHAVE ONLY HAD TO USE TWICE BUT IY SEEMS TO WORK VERY WELL WITH THE CAMERA..."
3,Kodak 5V adapter,"First the package took 5 days to arrive I paid for 2nd day air!Needless to say I left for vacation before the adapter arrived which did me no good. It was my understanding, the adapter would charge the battery, but that isn't so either. I would recomomd that you ask as many questions as you can and repeat them several times."
5,This is a book you can literally fall in love with......,"Lucas is currently my favorite book that I have read, and, since I read about 9 books or more a month, and my favorite books change a lot, this is saying a lot for me. This book just took my mind away, I felt as though I was in the story. You expirience the emotions felt by the the main character; it's just beautifully written. This book is not for everyone, however. It is not for those who want a happy ending, this is perhaps one of the only books that has ever made me cry. It is written with such a sense of power, you get hooked by the fast pace of the story and cannot put it down. It is such a lovable book; a true joy to read. I highly recommend this story."
5,This Is My Second Favorite Book of All Time,"Recently Meghan Cox Gurdon wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal that discussed why Young Adult fiction was getting too dark and there was nothing out that that parents would want to buy for their young adults to read. Obviously, neither she nor the mother in the article, Amy Freeman, bothered to look at this book. Yes, it covers heavy themes. It's about racism and bigotry, it touches on teen drinking and sex (GASP! Heaven forbid we read anything of the sort!!!) but it never glamorizes any of it. If anything, it made me cringe, and I was in my early 20s the first time I read this book. This book is so well written and it left me stunned and crying. I loved it so much that I actually wrote the author to tell him. He was kind enough to reply, and while this book is definitely his best, I have been a fan ever since. This is the book I buy everyone for their birthday. It is amazing and life changing. You won't be disappointed."
2,Young Adult Snooze,"This book is trying to be something, trying really really hard, but it never quite lives up to much of anything exciting. Yes, some of the writing is quite good, but the turtle pacing and overtly mundane account of every detail leave this novel selling the reader short. It was a real drudge to get through. I contemplated closing off after 100 pages, but I thought it might get better. Alas, it never did. I am baffled by some of the critic reviews, wonder what book they read? This book has murky pacing, coupled with a plot that is completely over-the-top. Also, I wish I had a dollar for every time I muttered ""cliche"" while reading. Don't make the mistake I did, skip this one. Try a book by Francesca Lia Block (my favorite YA writer)."
5,Amazing!,"The most incredible book i have ever read. IT captures your attention from the first moment on. Its so realistic it made me cry after reading it, it makes you feel as if your the characters, its heartwarming and shows painful truth of reality, i strongly recommend this book"
4,Great Book,"Lucas is a book for someone looking for a rush. I read this book in 1 day and enjoyed every page.Some of the things i loved: They Mystery of Lucas, The factual events (like the, that can actually really happen), The conflict between all the charactersSome of the things i hated: The difficulty of remembering all the characters, the rushed ending (i feel as if Brooks wanted to get it over with), and my unanswered questions (like what was really with Lucas?)def a 16+ up book"
2,"Very cheap, not nearly as good as its competition","I received my cover today and put it on my motorhome. The first thing I noticed was that the straps to go from one side to the other underneath are just a piece of string you have to cut up into pieces and tie at both ends. This is WAY less useful than the click/buckle adjustable straps on other covers I've used. The ladder cap supplied will not fit my ladder setup as it is sewn into a box shape and my ladder is attached to a railing at the top which will not allow this cover to be used. The second zipper I attempted to use separated half way down when I zipped it down to close it. There was no stress on it, but it still did not close properly. All in all, I think this cover is inferior to its competition."
4,Lots of fun,"I got this mainly so I could play the theme completely in both hands, and really enjoyed it. I played piano for maybe four years or so, though I quit lessons two or three years ago, so I found it challenging to play and actually can't reach some of the chords with my left hand. It's still a lot of fun to play, though, and I recommend it to all who enjoyed the music from the movie."
3,"Happy overall, given the alternatives.","I am happy with this product. It's MDF, but for the price this is expected, and the quality is a little better than IKEA (IKEA stuff of similar size and quality were more expensive).The only drawback is that some of the screws holding the piece together are visible from the sides of the furniture. There are small white plastic caps provided that you can use to cover the screws, but it still looks a little ugly."
4,Very cute accessory!,"I bought the twin time dollhouse for my 4 year old daughter for christmas and since the actual dollhouse doesn't come with much furniture, I purchased this set along with it. The nursery is very cute. It is also durable. It has lights, music and the mobile actually spins. The crib comes with pillows too. The set also comes with a hamper, and drawers for keeping the twins blankets. My daughter loves the addition. It fits cute on the top floor of the house."
1,Horrible CD,"I do not own this recording but have listened to several of the songs through Naxos' online classical music library. I must say that this is quite possibly the worst pair Naxos could have chosen to perform this repetoire. The pianist's playing is very stilted and many of the tempos are just incorrect (for example, Per pieta' bell'idol mio is too slow while Dolente immagine di Fille mia is much too fast).The tenor is horribly unmusical and lacking completely in Italian style. And, to top everything, he even has some blaring errors in his Italian pronunciation. In ""Dolente immagine di Fille mia"" he sings ""inestinGIUbile"" instead of ""inestinGUIbile."" This is unacceptable, especially in a recording that people are paying money for!!Cecilia Bartoli put out a CD (An Italian Songbook) that contains several of these Bellini songs. I would much recommend that CD over this one."
3,Niece loves her ring,Last year I bought myself a more expensive version of this ring. My 13 year old niece loves my ring. Every time I am around her she wants to try mine on. I wanted something similar for her that it would hurt if she damaged or lost it and I discovered this ring. She loves this ring. Wears it all the time. I believe you get what you pay for and this version will do just fine for her until she's older and knows how to take care of a more expensive ring.
2,The stone fell out!,"I was SO excited about how beautiful the ring looked when presenting it to my daughter for her 18th birthday. Three days later she called me tearfully at work saying that the center stone had fell out (luckily she was able to locate it with the help of her friends). I haven't been able to find out how to get it replaced, but I'm very disappointed!"
3,Short lived beauty,"I was excited when I got this becasue it was exactly what I wanted big and sparkling. It is also very strong and durable. I was really disappointed at how fast the shine went away, I wasn't expecting real gold and gem quality but I had hoped that for the money it would have lasted longer than a couple days. I wore it to work for two days and by the end of the second day it was dull had lost its luster nad one of the side diamopnds had fallen out. I am a receptionist so it isn't like I get dirt and grime on my hands and do anything that would ruin it quickly. I even tried cleaning it with a jewelry shining cloth and it just didn't shine it up. Overall it is ok but for near $30 for a fake ring I expected more."
2,Not a good buy,It looks great on the internet but then when I received it at home it looked cheap. I wore it once and that has been it.
1,Not a good buy,I have no idea why I bought this ring but it really isn't good at all. After about a month the band tarnished and I basically didn't wear it anymore. I used jewelry cleaner and it made the stones shine but the band became worse. I believe it ended up in the garbage. It would be cute for a kid but then again I see the stone fell out for that poor kid. I on the other hand am 22.
4,Good things come in small packages...,"This album is great, PMosh's been one of my favorite bands since I first Heard ""Niño Bomba"" (from their previous album, Aquamosh), this album is so... mixed with all kinda cool music, I don't like to label music, so I don't know what they sound like, they're just Plastilina Mosh and they Rock! you won't regret buyin' this one. Ah, in case you're wondering, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the legnth (33 min. in my Edition(Mexican), wich has only 11 songs), but 33 min. well worth, hence the title of this review."
3,Warning - This is not a romance,"I bought the book expecting one of Lora Leigh's hot romantica novels, so I was a little disappointed when it turned out to be a fantasy book instead. That said, it's not actually a bad fantasy book. It's not George Martin, but it's relatively entertaining and I didn't have to force myself to read the whole thing. But Lora Leigh fans be warned - there are no love scenes at all, unless you count some inappropriate wing touching."
5,Really good non romance read,Broken wings is not at all along the same lines of Lora Leigh's normal reads. This book really shows how inventive and excelent a writer Leigh can be. I was pleasently suprised and would love to hear more about the winged people in this book.
1,terrible. it was a childs fairy tale.,not anything like how she normally writes. i felt like i was ripped off. i love the breed books i felt like it was false advertisement to even call this a breed book. total waste of money.
4,Worth reading,"I was deeply disturbed by the violent rapes depicted in this book, the scenes between the lovers was skipped but the violence was written out in gruesome detail. I give 4 stars because the book was good, the story gripping, but if you've experienced violence, you might want to avoid this one. It was upsetting to me and I've never been assaulted, so I shudder to think of the reaction sensitive people might have. If you can stand the violence, then this is recommended."
3,Little disappointed,"I have come to expect a certain amount intrigue, passion and imagination when I read Lora Leigh book. Broken Wings gave good story and intriguing characters but skipped majorly on passion. The only scene that showed any form of sexuality was rape scene which of course I understood necessarily for the plott but upset by the end the book that this was all we were being given. The first time and I hope the last time I get shorten of the love scene from a Lora Leigh/Ellora's Cave book."

4,"Solid Album, Not The Absolute Best, Though.","Overdressed is a good album. You really can't deny this. I find ""Hold the Light,"" and ""Sacred"" are the best songs on this album. I saw Caedmon's, Derek, and Andy Osenga in concert performing this CD as well as many others from 40 Acres, Back Home, etc. They do a good job of balancing all these talented people in the group.Granted, this is not my favorite Caedmon's album. I enjoy, like many of the other reviewers, the ""lyrical subtlety"" of previous albums (also found on a lot of Derek's earlier stuff). All this being said, it is definitely worth the money. It is a great album to listen to if you're into Christian music. The musicality in this album is wonderful and I can't get over their harmonies when they do them."
3,"Good, but not great over all..some gems though!","I'm a big Caedmon's Call fan, but ever since ""Back Home"", I've had to listen to their albums a few times before I really get hooked...with Back home being my least favorite (still good) and 40 Acres being my favorite. Over all I'm not too disappointed with this album. I really love ""Trouble"", ""Share in the Blame"", and ""Hold The Light"". ""Hold the Light"" is an exceptional song that deserves many many listens. 2 weeks seems like it would have fit better on the Share the Well album.I think a more appropriate album title should have been ""Coming of Age"". The album talks a lot about moving into new stages of life."
3,Not quite.,"Caedmon's Call is capable of more than this. Nothing will beat their debut CD. How many band members do they need? ""Sacred"" is the best song. There doesn't seem to be much songwriting anymore."
4,Awesome cd,"On there new cd I thought songs 2&3 6-9 & 11 were really awesome. Songs 1,4,10 & 12 were just out of place. They were just so so. Id buy the cd for the other songs alone."
3,this yard blower does not include needed vacuum kit,"Was given this blower as a gift. Blower works great BUT I am unable to find anyone, including the manufacter, who carries the needed vacuum kit which is not included and must be purchased separately.If anyone has a vacuum kit (Model EBVA 1910) for sale, please contact me."
5,Awesome!,"This collar (14in) is the perfect size for my 15lb Chug (Pug/Chihuahua mix). I put it on him as soon as it arrived tonight and now he looks like one seriously bad *** Canine! Great product, at a great price!"
2,Decent introduction to SEO,"Book was 150 pages, once you take out the vast expanse of white space, it boiled down to about 30 pages of material. This book really should have just been published as a free PDF. The style is that of a question and answer for each topic covered in the book. It does not go into a great deal of detail. However, the book does provide introduction into the world of SEO and some of the basics to look out for."
3,Good for short lap sessions,"I work from home and was hoping for a lap desk that would make 'hot lap' a thing of the past. The Lapinator does a good job - for an hour or maybe two. After that the heat from my laptop starts to reach my legs. This may have to do with my machine (MacBook Pro 15"") venting from the back and others with laptops that vent at the bottom may have better luck.A good product, but not a permanent solution for me."
3,Wrong Size,The Lapinator was great but I am looking for a different size. It is too small. Other than that it seemed great to me.
2,Slippery Surface,"Used Lapinators for a few years but had to buy a new one to accomodate widescreen notebook. Even though the notbook has four rubber ""legs"", the computer still slips on the lapinator.Yes, the order included three round rubber bumpers to glue on top of Lapinator, but this doesn't help as the bottom of the notebook still slips.The wide Lapinators are simply too slippery; knowing that the company included the rubber bumpers.Poor design of a product I previously endorsed."
5,Can't live without it,This is an excellent product: it is so light you almost don't feel it's there! I've been a happy owner for one year now.
4,Cool and Comfortable (even with MacBook Pro,"I use a macbook pro and it gets so hot it's mind boggling. I have both an X-pad and a lapinator. I prefer the lapinator (when my husband isn't using it). It is more comfortable in terms of both pressure and temperature on your lap. The X-pad is better looking, and packs in my computer bag much more easily. However, it is not as comfortable (the lapinator has cushion-y bumpers), and still gets warm with extended use (though not unbearably, as it does without it)."
2,too hot-too hot-too hot,"i have been using this product for a few weeks now. it is very comfortable and provides a great base for the laptopthe problem? it is TOO HOT...this is only marginally better than having no venting at all. i have another type of lap desk without the padding and it keeps my lap top very cool.so you have a choice to make, comfort or cooling....unfortunately this product does NOT provide both"
2,Cheap materials particularly the rubber feet,"I bought this because it is light and all around minimal. I commute 3 hours on a bus to work so I wanted something to be used on my lap primarily and easy to carry around. I would actually give it a thumbs up if the 3 rubber feet didn't slide off the holder. I actually don't mind cheap materials if it doesn't get in the way of the product functioning. I have a MacBook Pro and without the rubber feet, the computer slides off the holder. I contacted Lapinator to inquire how to purchase more rubber feet for the Lapinator and they haven't responded in 2 weeks. I have since bought the Xpad Non-slip Laptop Cooler & Heatshield and am MUCH happier. Even though it is a bit more to carry around, the rubber ""feet"" are built in so I don't have the issues I had with the Lapinator."
3,Works OK,"I have been using this thing for about 6 months now. It's well made and practical to use around the house (at least better than the pillows and books I was using before). Still, it's basically a sheet of rigid plastic with padding underneath, so I can't see how it would fail to work.A few issues:1. The Lapinator is very light but still pretty bulky. It's a lot larger than my 12"" iBook (which is not that small). I never took it with me when traveling because I never had that extra space in my carryon luggage. That's a bummer.2. I had to add 3 extra smaller rubber feet to support the front of the notebook (to complement those in the back), because the iBook (like my other notebook, a Dell) gets hot mostly in the front. Also, due to the slight bending of the plastic board that the notebook rests on, it looks like there is actually less air circulation than when it is resting on a desk."
5,"Affordable, fast and functional!",I'm so impressed with this product and this company. My order was efficiently filled and I got a very nice confirmation email from the company.It's here (early)! It works (great)! and I'm very happy!
3,"Actually, 4 Stars!!","This product is an excellent idea. I use an HP zt3000, which is a widescreen laptop. Because of the Lapinator's square size, my computer hangs over the sides of the Lapinator. However, the provided ""bumpers"" secure it quite nicely.It also seems very effective in dissipating heat. I do still wish they made an addition for wider laptops, but I've still been very pleased with this product."
1,"Horrible for hot, bottom vented laptops!","The plastic becomes pliable when it's hot and basically sucks right up to the vents on the bottom of your computer, even with the little rubber feet in place. It really blocks the heat alright.. blocks it from escaping the computer at all!"
4,A good one to have,"I ordered it from Amazon after seeing quite many good reviews from customers. It arrived yesterday and I tried it. Well, worked pretty well. I used to feel burning heat on my lap but with the lapinator pad, I only feel luke warm which doesn't bother me much. Yet to see how long this piece last - given the price it could last for 6-8 months, I think it's worth. Will see. As of now, I'd recommend it to others."
3,Optical Mice Don't Work on This Surface,I bought this as a present for my girlfriend and was too cheap to get her the extra mousepad. Big mistake. This lap desk barely fits her black macbook and the surface is too shiny to read an optical mouse. Other than that the product is great.
4,Hot pants,I like this product. I had been meaning to pick one up for myelf for some time. It made a good Christmas gift.The product itself is nothing too fancy. It does it's job of comfortably supporting the computer and reducing heat. It is far better than a book or whatever makeshift support I was using.I also chose this product because the more expensive ones with fans had reviews that said they were noisy and unreliable (though I never tested them).
1,Very Disapointing,"I ordered this as a gift for my daughter, but would be to embarrassed to give it to her, once I saw the product. It's very cheap looking. I plan on returning it, even if I have to lose out on the shipping cost."
4,Does what it says but still a bit pricey,I'm using this with a Gateway/ACER LTU3119 netbook. I run it for about 1-2 hours a night while sitting in bed. The Lapinator keeps the heat off of my legs and keeps my netbook cool. I like the cushioned supports on the bottom as they keep airflow to my legs but are also handy when i need to set the computer down on the uneven bed surface.I'd give it 5 stars if it were at least $5 cheaper. No smell on mine like some reviews noted.
3,Good... BUT...,"This little lap desk is good for keeping the laptop heat off of your legs, and seeing as it does elevate the back of the laptop it does increase airflow. That is where the good stuff ends. If you have a laptop that tends to run rather hot, or if you tend to leave it running for extended periods of time; the plastic on top of the lap desk will begin to stink as though the plastic is melting/burning. The quality of the materials is cheap (feels like something you could make on your own for much less), but the pads are soft and they do their job well enough. All-in-all, not a terrible product, but for $25 I was hoping for something that would be of a little better quality; instead, I got a product that keeps the laptop cool but stinks up my home with the smell of melting plastic."
2,Made in China + ridiculously over-priced,This product has a patent pending and is made in China -- but these facts are not listed in the product detail. It's cheaply made and ridiculously over-priced for what it is. I shop online on Amazon at least 2-5 times a month and have never been so seriously disappointed in a purchase. Buy something else of better quality than this lapinator.
3,It works,"The product does what Lapinator says it does. I do like the product, but I wasn't amazingly impressed with the quality of the item.As for the statement made about the colour black ""[absorbing] and [holding] heat,"" this only happens when LIGHT is shining on a black surface. When it comes to conducting heat from one object to another, it doesn't matter what the colour is. Wearing black underwear doesn't make you warmer."
1,Lapinator,This is not made well - a hard board with a piece of covering. Hard to keep the computer on it. I would have returned it but it would have cost me just as much to keep it. Do not buy.
5,this is great!,It is well made and I think it will last a long time. My husband has piles of business cards because of work and needed something to put them in besides a box. This works well.
3,Sturdy buy.,"Solid and sturdy. A good card holder, but far too big, heavy and cumbersome for a handbag. Well made and quite reasonably priced for what it is, however."
3,Business card book,"The book is useful. However, I would have preferred to have a tabbed index rather than having to use up one of the card slots for the index."
4,A great series for any age reader!,"FROM THE PUBLISHERHe Thought He'd Left the Past Behind. Yet One Terrible Tragedy Brings It All Back ...The year is 1863. In the East, the Civil War rages on. The mountains of California seem remote and untouched by the struggle of the young nation. Tom Dawson has found a refuge from the political and social conflicts running a small ranch with his brother beneath Shadow Ridge.This man with a restless past, his ""rugged, sun-browned face creviced from the weather like a landscape,"" discovers some measure of peace and happiness at Shadow Ridge with his brother's little family. Then comes the news that the stagecoach has been robbed and six people murdered by a gang of rebel sympathizers stealing Union gold for the South. Without warning, the turmoil of Dawson's past returns.As he moves toward a final confrontation, the Dawson home is shattered by a second tragedy. Where will he find the courage and faith to continue?"
1,WOW!!! NOT AGAIN?!?!?,"When will I learn??? I got hood-winked, , ,again!!!I should have recognised the authors, , ,but, , ,sadlyI didn't!!! Tttttoooo much religion, GOD, salvation, souls,etc, etc, etc!!! I made it about 100 pages closed the bookand committed their names to memory, , ,never again!!!"
1,Limited in scope and somewhat dated,"The title, EroticPower: An exploration of Dominance andSubmission, while accurate is somewhat misleading. Its primaryemphasis is on the Female Dominant/male submissive area of what currently comes under the general heading of BDSM. Those who are seeking a broader overview of erotic power and its place in BDSM would be better served by reading one of the more current titles available. Originally published in 1980 and revised and updated in 1997, it still lacks in being a comprehensive overview of the subject of erotic power exchange due to its limited scope. At best I would suggest this only as a primer for those interested in learning about Female Dominance and male submission."
2,its midnight blue not wine,"This eyeliner is suppose to be wine, but its really blue.. Thats what is difficult about buying make up online.. It would be great if seller had a better description about product, or maybe a swatch of the color..The pencil is nice quality, but wasnt color i was looking for, butI will not purchase again from this seller"
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed with the book. I feel it lacked information. I think the author needed to get more detailed. i would not recommend
4,Spiritual & Insightful,"Very insightful and informative. Let's the readers know why we as Christians should tithe and give and the benefits for tithing. Tithing is a way of trust between you and GOD. God doesn't need your money, but your faithfulness in Him. Mr. Larry Burkett uses the Bible to teach its readers plus good old common sense to make it easy to understand for those that read and don't read the Bible."
3,Good Book,"The book gives very compelling ""whys"" for tithing. Another good book on this subject is ""Robbing God? Tough Questions for Non- Tithers"". by Dr. McNeese. He uses tough questions in a Socratic counseling format to show that we should not only give a tithe, but according to the New Testament, giving the 10% alone could still be short-changing God. [...]."
2,Giving NOT Tithing,"Larry was a blessing to so many but he really swallowed the error of tithing. There is not a single verse telling Christians or churches to tithe, Paul never asked for tithes or salary, none of the apostles taught tithing. In Galatians Paul taught keeping an OT law (like tithing) brings the believer under the curse of the law. Bro. Burkett died from the effects of cancer, which is of the curse in Dt. 28. The NT teaches over and over ""giving"" (not tithing). Most giving went directly to needy Christians not a building or personal kingdom called a ministry. Read ""The Tithe That Binds"" free at [...]"
2,The Tomorrow People,The tomorrow people is a 1960's style. Everything is peace and love related and child like. A child might be able to get through the show.
3,Mixed feelings,"I'd never actually seen this version of ""The Tomorrow People"", but I was a huge fan of the remake which ran on Nickelodeon back in the mid 90's. I decided to give this a chance on a whim, and I was a little dissapointed. The acting is beyond bad. The special effects are cheesy. If I was to compare it to the remake, I'd have to say I liked the remake much better. However, the writing isn't terrible. There's some real creativity going on here. If you can get past the cheesiness it's worth a watch."
2,"It's not aged well at all, rubbish",Well Im a brit and grew up watching some episodes of this when it was shown originally in the UK. I got the first region 2 UK dvd a while back and was appalled by how bad it was. My beloved doctor who stands the passage of time much better.BEWARE THE CHEATING MEMORIES OF YOUR CHILDHOOD.
2,An old series just for nostalgic,"Well, I was a child when I used to adore this Brit series.The thing is that we now live in a very high qualified age of visual standards and Tomorrow People seem to be very very nave in many ways.Tomorrow People however handled the idea of evolved humans but with more intelectual powers (instead of the mutant ones now en bogue in movie industry).Before buying it I suggest to take a look at just one of the chapters before decide if you can still enjoy these series made 30 years ago."
3,Loved this Show as a youngster!,"Thank you Very Much for this, such Fast Service, great Delivery just as Advertised: I Look forward to recalling the Joy, I had watching this seminal Sci Fi Program!"
3,A sound 'primer',"An easy to read, simple description of the basics of people management in knowledge organisations. It brings together well established principles and practices and puts them into a 'knowledge' context. Could be useful for managers in the early stages of movement from a 'traditional' to a 'knowledge' mind-set."
4,Not bad at all,"Definitely bio-punk; the world that Gibson and Williams and Sterling built, with computers de-emphasized and messy smelly squishy sexy biological stuff pumped way up.At least in this book, Di Filippo is more willing than the classic cyberpunk writers to go over the top, to be a little silly. When he writes ""Coney dropped like a smartbomb from a scramjet"", he may be accurately forecasting the way technological words seep into common speech, but I suspect he's just having fun. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, and you don't mind figuring out a heavy dose of new vocabulary on the fly (I like it, myself; I figured out most things, including ""whychromes"", but although I got the meaning of ""reedpair"" quickly enough I'm still in the dark on the etymology of it), you'll probably enjoy this book.I did."
1,Dystopian future as imagined by Marvel / Disney.,"The majority of Di Filippo's stories take place using modified groups of criminals and policemen and anthropomorphic animals.To the extent this book talks about biotechnology, it is of the children's book trope type: criminals and policemen are forced to upgrade themselves for pointless war games, and talking animals are used to illustrate slavery."
5,Enormously entertaining and creative,How I wish this writer would do some more of his speculative SF. This collection of short stories is some of the most innovative and well conceived stuff available without a prescription. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who likes writers like greg egan or neal stephensen.
2,NO DELIVERY AND NO FOLLOW-UP,"I received King Lear and Othello within several days of my order. However, I have never received Hamlet or MacBeth. I had noted this once or twice to Amazon. Additionally, when there was no response from the seller, I cancelled the last two.Betty Goldman"
4,A good intro to classical (with a twist) world history,"This book is not as entertaining as the earlier volume. But it does cover a lot of history, and certainly is one way to get kids today learning some history. The reading list in the back of the book is excellent."
2,"Entertaining, but NOT appropriate for middle school students","I purchased this book because I wanted to check out the series as a whole. I thought it might be useful as an alternative to the text book for my 7th grade social studies students studying world civilizations. However, I do NOT feel this book is appropriate for 12-13 year old students. Content-wise it is great, but the author's humor throughout the book is definitely at a high school or adult level."
2,More Cartoon Editorials on History,"Devoid of some of the freshness, levity and humor of the first volume, this one features a more cynic and ascerbic tone. Lao Tze is dispatched in a couple of pages, precious little space is dedicated to the exposition of achievements of lasting historical value while much space is dedicated to moralistic criticism of the universal aspects of power mongering--monarchial or otherwise--and military issues and campaigns. The artwork, however, is great. Buy knowing that this is not a history but cartoon editorials on historical figures and events."
4,From the Springtime of China to the Fall of Rome,"This is the second volume of Larry Gonick'sCartoon History of the Universe. The series tells the history of the world, in comic book form. Lots of bad puns are thrown in to keep things interesting. This particular volume focuses on India, China and Rome. This is a fun way to learn history."
5,Sign me up for C H o U III. Will you get to the plague?,"I bought Cartoon History of the Universe I 'cause I was kind of disturbed at my total inability to distinguish a phillipino from a philistine. After reading Gonick's treasure I now know that they are slightly differet kinds of pasta salad imported to Portugal via the spice route through Sammarkand by Marco Polo, Dave Barry, and Pocohontas. If there are any inaccuracies above just let it be my testament to wanting more. When will Cartoon History of the Universe III come out? I loved the book. Very informative. I'm reading both again cause I spent the first read laughing leaving little in my memory banks. These books are a great broad brush truly global sketch of history from the little people to the kings that for me serve as an excellent coat rack upon which I will hang more detailed histories for particular eras gone by."
3,Gonick has sold out quality for quantity and cash,"Gonick's Cartoon History of the World, Vol 1-7 was an early formative experience for me. The art was amazing and the text was witty and informative (expecially for a 13 year old). I'm now 20 and Gonick is still pretty funny, but he apparently doesn't have the time to do the art right any more. I've been disappointed with everything I've read of his since that first great book. I'll bet he's banking like a bandit though."
5,Can't wait for vol. III,"I've read and re-read both volumes I & II many many times in the last 4 years. Great fun. I've been waiting since 1996 for Vol. III. Please Mr. Gonick, do I have to wait much longer ?"
5,excellent way to learn and be entertained,everything i expected and more. I have read 2 other of his works. He is smart and funny and draws like a champ.
3,Fails to meet the high standard of the first book,"This second book is nowhere near as good as the first one and lacked in atmosphere for lack of a better word.There is too much mundane detail and dragging on about China. I did learn a lot about Chinese history that I didn't know before but he would spend several pages on stories that didn't seem to make much difference. Obviously, this is an area of study that he enjoys."
4,History of the universe Part II,"Larry Gonick continues to pull off the trick of being amusing, witty and funny.The second instalment of his history of the Universe covers ancient India, China's early years and Rome from its mythical founding to its very real collapse."
4,Nice ski rack,"This was just what I wanted in a ski rack. Great price, comes with locks, springs open, easy open button and quality-made. Only problem I had was the universal mounts wouldn't fit around my OEM base rack so I had to modify them. It wasn't too difficult. Otherwise, this is a great ski rack for the money."
4,Great Country AND Western music,"This is the second of Joni's cds I've purchased (I know, Harms fans - I'm just getting started!), and I'm not at all disappointed. A strong, earnest voice, meaningful lyrics, and top-notch production share the spotlight on this highly enjoyable album. Here's an album parents can listen to with the kids without worry. In fact, hearing these stories of wholesome romance, western ways, and down-home values will do them good. Even if you're trapped in suburbia (or, heaven forbid, the big city), Joni Harms carries you away to the open country. And what a glorious trip!Look for earlier cds on her website. I think there are 9 albums in all."
2,Not as claimed,"The cover claims the book has a complete list of lections for years A, B, and C. This is not true as it only includes the complete lection list for the SUNDAYS of those years and a very few special days."
5,A childhood favorite finally in my collection...,"It's not easy to watch a cartoon as a child and then try to go back and appreciate it as an adult. Many of my favortie childhood cartoon favorties have not stood the test of time. Thankfully, Danger Mouse is not one of them. It's premise is simple but effective. I still love the classic British humor displayed here and the cast of characters are great. Combine all that with a catchy theme song and you've got a great little cartoon that I can't wait to show my own kids someday."
1,"Very cute, but boring","This TV Series is very cute, but it isn't good because it's boring and it gives you a headache. Maybe some other season are better but, at least, this one's not worth buying it. It's actually made for younger viewers, but it's way different than Hanna-Barbera cartoons. The animation is horrible, the episodes are too short, and the music's even worse. You can only stand watching 2 or 3 episodes per day and the sound or the voices are horrible, too. It's that kind of cartoon you see it's really childish and for kids about 3 years-old. I don't understand why people say it's like 007 because it's a real drag.The DVD itself is not so good, either, because there aren't a lot of options and languages.It really looks like it's a good series, but it's not the kind of DVD to buy it. I love old cartoons like Hanna-Barbera, Speed Racer, and Jonny Quest but this is not the same type. I really like the character itself and I think it's vey cute, but don't buy this."
5,Finally on DVD!!!,My husband is a MEGA Danger Mouse fan and was thrilled to know that it was finally on DVD...so I gave it to him for his birthday. He has had a great time laughing and enjoying his old favorite cartoon and has made our daughter a fan of it as well! Awesome!! A thinking-man's cartoon!!! We look forward to complelting the collection with more of the show on DVD!!
5,All In The Family Season 7- thru,This is incredible.What is going on with Seasons 7 and on with AITF? I cannot believe that Sony does not want to make money on this classic that we are yelling for.Does anyone know more then I do when these are going to be released?
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"The company that made this dvd, is named ""SHOUT"". Amateur quality. As a viewer, I was FORCED to view every boxed dvd set this company sells. Shows that, this viewer, would enjoy. Unfortunately, disabling the fast forward feature was a extreme disappointment. This viewer had to watch the company's commercials that were, approximately, 3 to 4 minutes. Advertising should be a positive experience. However, this company made the viewer unwanted nonsense because the fast forward ability was disabled. POOR QUALITY. WILL NOT BUY FROM AGAIN."
3,WHY IS SONY DVD PRODUCT SO SLOW?,"What is SONY's excuse for waiting over two years to release Season 7 of All in the family? they refused to respond to any emails I sent them.It is JUST SONY PRODUCT dvds that take FOREVER. Example--what happened to Season TWO of SWAT? (it is NEVER coming to DVD!) What happened to Season 2,3,4 of THE ROOKIES from SONY? Where is Season 3,4,5 of TJ HOOKER? SONY DVD SUCKS. They release ONE season of a show and then discard or forget about the rest of a series. I have been waiting THREE years for Season 7 of All in the family--thank you so much SONY -you SUCK!!"
1,Those were the days...,"I don't think we are ever going to see the remaining seasons of this show. Sony will never relinquish their rights to another DVD company and they don't seem willing to put them out themselves. I can't imagine how one of the most popular shows in television history has been so badly neglected. It's a shame. I've watched my DVDs of the first six seasons so many times that they have been worn down. I haven't even seen all the episodes in the last seasons because I was so young when my parents watched the repeats. A show like this will never be allowed to air again, because of the sensitivity of people today. Perhaps that is why they aren't releasing the rest of the show? If it's for money, couldn't they produce the DVDs on an order-to-order basis? Meaning, purchasing the DVDs directly from Sony?"
1,concerning websites offering AITF Complete Series DVD,"I saw where a review mentioned a website that offers season 1-12 of All in the Family? Just wanted to warn people be cautious of these claims!I recently purrchased what was advertised as All in the Family Complete TV series seasons 1 through 9, for $96 this included $11 s/h as it came from an Asian country. Well much to my disappointment when I looked at it, it was only 1 through 6, the exact thing I already had! ! ! And now they won't return my e-mails. So be warned people!"
2,The Draft Dodger,"The quintessential episode, so profoundly moving in every way possible, BUTCHERED at the most crucial moment -- dialogue that was absolutely relevant to the emotional impact of the moment -- shamelessly edited. That's censorship for you... an absurdity that was at the heart of that very episode."
3,Deceived,"I was so happy to finally be able to purchase the seventh season so I could watch ""The Draft Dodger"" as I remember seeing it before they butchered it. I hoped maybe they found the unedited print and used it here but they did not much to my dismay . I guess we will have to wait for Sony to put it out as they must have the master. These are just the same copies you see on TVLand without the comercials and cleaned uo a bit . Needless to say I'm P****D OFF!!"
5,Season 7 Coming Soon!,Sony has sold the rights to All in the Family to SHOUT! I'm not sure when Season 7 will be released but as of June 23rd SHOUT! now owns the DVD rights to All in the Family and will complete the series!!!!
3,Too many commercials!!,"I think it is terrible to put in all the adds for other products and one can't even fast forward thru them. I will never order again. When all the other seasons were from Sony, I didn't have to battle with all that stuff."
5,Love Archie!,"This was a great season of ""All in the Family"", I enjoyed every moment reliving the unforgettable season once again!"
2,sadly true,"I so very much enjoyed seasons 1 thru 6 of all in the family, sadly the quality of season 7 is just plain WEIRD. sometimes heads look wide, and to big. It is hard to enjoy this fantastic show, when you hear a funny line, and at the same time it looks like you are watching a horror movie.until i read the reviews i thought it was me. you know, watching the show and trying to convince myself the actors heads were not really to big or to wide, and archies chair was not twisted. so forth and so on. at least now i know i do not need to see my doctor to check and see if i have a nuerological disorder of some kind. i just had an idea that might work,i am going to take off my perscription glasses and see how that works out for me. on a serious note,it is very disrespectful to the actors who played edith and archie bunker who are no longer with us, to put out such garbage. yours truly, stan from brooklyn, n.y."
5,It's taking FOREVER !!,"What in the world is taking so long? It's just getting longer and longer. It seems like the best shows take the longest to get released. It makes no sense to me at all. I love this show, and I always will. Long live Archie Bunker ... If they would ever release this season???? And, don't forget seasons 8 and 9 too. It will probably be 2011, By the time we all get to enjoy ALL the seasons!! Anyways, Let's all hope this comes out soon !!!"
5,It's about time!,"It's about time that someone had the courage to complete the task that Sony was too weak to complete. Bravo to The Shout Factory for continuing the release of one of the best sitcoms ever made. Actually, All in The Family may be THE best sitcom ever made. It was the first to look at real life situations. It dealt with race, sexuality, gender issues, violence, sexism, etc.I hope the Shout Factory takes on another controversial (although not as controversial) show, i.e., Maude. Maude was great, and if it were not for You Tube, we'd be robbed of many of the episodes. Also, I hope Shout Factory completes The Jeffersons.Bravo!"
1,Don't buy this,"I bought it yesterday and started watching this morning and I could not believe how bad the picture is. You are better off using a VHS and tape it off of TV Land as season 7 is just around the corner on TV Land. I think they used a VHS, put it through top soil and then transferred it to DVD. What a rip off."
2,"Wild Game Pack (Venison, Kangaroo, Buffalo) - Wisconsin Cheeseman (Purchased on 12/10/2006)",took way too long to be delivered...I wanted it before Christmas and didn't get it...over two weeks to deliver
4,Good Stuff,The meat was a little dry but overall so delicious!The mustard that comes with it was great.I highly recoomend this item.
3,"Good taste, but uncertain how much is ""filler""","These looked interesting to try, though other than the kangaroo it didn't seem too exotic (my folks made venison sausage when I was a kid and I have buffalo from time to time). The ingredients for each including beef and pork, such that they tasted more like regular sausage with a slightly different flavor than something unique from your standard pork/summer sausage."
1,Very disapointing,"For a book that claims to be an atlas, this is only a collection of photograps with no map. Badly mistitled and costly to boot. Don't waste your money."
2,Daughter loves these dolls - Toys R Us has them for $5.00 each!!!!!!,Buy them here and get ripped off!!!! Toys R Us has them for $5.00 each!
2,Difficult to navigate,"Although this may be a good marketing book for writers, I found the lack of professional typesetting bothersome: using lines of hyphens between entries, instead of subject headers or bullets; using bold AND italics for book titles are just a few problems. But the biggest error is that there is no index in the back of the book. A book such as this begs for a lengthy index of author's names, subject headers, book titles, etc. I found it frustrating trying to navigate through this hodge podge of advice."
2,Finally found,I've been looking for this cd for a long time and I finally found it here on Amazon. I remember watching the tv show that these girls were on and I liked the songs I heard them sing so I decided to get the album. It was alright I only like 2 songs out of the whole album
5,Really good,Before I got this CD i didnt really like the pop kind of music but this CD really changed my mind. I recomend everyone to buy it. Its awesome!
3,Perhaps...,"If you like pop groups like Play, No Secrets, and Dream Street, you should get this CD. But, personally, I think there are too many of these type of artists out already. None of them made it that far except the ones that changed to a sort of rock type of music like Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. I think you should try to do your own thing like Good Charlotte. I really don't think these girls will get that far. They have great voices and their songs are okay, but there is too much competition out there to be noticed. But, like I said, if you like pop music, try this out."
5,GREAT!,"I love this cd! It's very cool...I don't know how to put it in words...I love the song ""the world of make believe! Well...I highly suggest you buy this cd!luv ya like a lollypop,Nikki"
3,Its All Been Done Before,"I agree with another reviewer. Now 3rd Faze isn't a bad group or anything, their music has great potential, but I mean, do Americans not get sick of the cliche Pop/R&B vibe of White girl groups? I am a fan of Destiny's Child myself, and their music has a certain ring to it that no other group could duplicate, its something about white girls that try to do R&B, its kind of like, Whoa, no, don't even try, you sound like such a wannabe. If 3rd Faze was techno/trance, then I'd be all over these girls, but sadly, thats not the choice of music in the US. Heres to 3rd Faze, I wish you the best of luck and the best of everything in the music biz."
2,poor quality control,"The tri-color cartridge has already been rejected by my printer. Luckly, I ordered two. The second cartridge has so far been functional."
3,"Try it, and go with a good seller","For the price, it's worth a try. Even if half of them fails, you are still up on the deal.It sat for about a few months, and then I replaced the black catridge. The first one put in, does not work. Half of the page missing, the rest messed up. Cleaned the head, tried again, still no good. Popped the second one in, worked. So, it's a hit or miss.I used seller, ""Quanturium"", they are very nice. Obviously I am past my 30 day return, but they didn't question that. Just sent me another black one. That's good customer service. You can trust that seller!"
4,Good value!,This is a good product for the money but it was about 10 days late on the shipping! The seller did refund my money because it took too long! I have been using the ink since I received it in the mail and so far so good!
5,So Far they work!,"I bought the pack for 2 color and 2 black cartridges. I only used 1 color so far. At first, when I put the cartridge in my printer it didn't recognize it. I powered off the printer and installed the cartridge and turned it back on. Sure enough it works! No problems!I received my package quickly and am pleased. Great value!"
4,Compatible HP ink cartridges,"Haven't used the cartridges yet but they look like the originals, were shipped fast and were a good value price."
4,Very good for the price,"I'm not going to say that the printing is perfect but , for everyday use they work just fine . The black is excellent and the color is good for everyday printing , but only acceptable in fast print . I would buy these again ."
1,You get what you pay for in this case,"I've had this printer for a while but it's been a workhorse. I didn't want to put a lot more into it so I bought this cheaper ink. I just need it to print simple text documents most of the time and then be able to ramp up quality for a few prints for a client. I could't even print simple text documents with either set of catridges without terrible streaks. This ink was a total waste I'm afraid. I haven't tried returning it yet, not sure if I can. The printer is no good if you don't get a decent enough ink to have at least fair quality prints. Lesson learned."
1,Didn't work.,"The two color cartridges did not work, and I tried to get them replaced and never heard back from the provider."
4,Interesting. Some stories are better than others,"This is a interesting concept in general. I gave it a four star because a few stories in there seemed forced.Some of the stories have a few points/themes in common. Such as H.G.Wells, Alice in Wonderland, Watson being the real genius, and Holmes being a fake or even a villian. I wonder if it's intentional to have common themes or was it a coincidence.Two of the stories i especially liked. One, Second Fiddle by Kristine Kathryn Rusch. Second, The Adventure of the Second Scarf by Mark Aronson."
4,Good deal,"Don't listen to Alexander or W; they're idiots. Probably Alex didn't completely close the hidden ziplock. As for W, I have a Canon SD1000 and, based on his advice, I got the W300 instead of the 100. Big mistake! Now that I have the right one, it fits perfectly! No, the flash will NOT work, and so your pictures will probably be blurry except in clear water in sunshine, but for the price it's great. I wonder if someone makes a water-proof, radio-controlled flash..."
4,"Great product, minor flaws","This is a great alternative to expensive waterproof housings for digital cameras. I purchased this for a compact digital camera after loosing my hard case (and sony cybershot) on a rafting trip. Not wanting to risk such a big loss again, I bought this soft case in hopes that it would do the job. It keeps the water out well, but the lack of a tight fit between the lens housing and camera occasionally creates a peripheral black shadow on photos an videos. For the cost, you can't beat it."
3,Met expectations,"I read all the reviews before I bought this item and decided it wasn't worth the risk to submerge it under water at any point, regardless of the ""tissue test."" That said, I bought it to protect my new camera from sand, rain, etc. on a recent trip to Costa Rica. It added peace of mind when I used the camera and performed just as I hoped. As mentioned in other reviews, be sure to line the lens up before taking any pictures as you'll find a black corner in your pictures from the case otherwise.All in all, worth the money for what it is, and go in with lowered expectations."
4,"unpromising start, but a good read","The beginning is a little annoying, with the heroine appearing to be a know-it-all, and the hero an idiot, but then it changes rapidly and becomes quite a good read. Well developed, interesting secondary characters, lots of them, humor and adventure. This is one I'll be re-reading."
3,"Good on the films' history, but highly questionable on conspiracy theories","Highly controversial indeed ! I totally agree with one of the reviewers here that it is rather disappointing that we do not get a true break down on what is happening in the key shot sequences of the film i.e. the single bullet theory sequence from Z220 to Z270 approx and head shot sequence Z312 to Z340 approx. And it is quite disappointing too that we do not have the witness list of the people closest to the limousine in Zapruder's film and in fact to know how many came forward and who are not known to this day if any.It is an interesting read in some ways in that you are given a good history of the film, but the books conclusions around conspiracy are thin and do not stand up to modern day scrutiny in my opinion. One for the collection, but if you are new to the case there are other books which are better read such as Richard Trask's book on the Zapruder film and Mel Ayton's works."
1,An Historian?,"It's hard to imagine this book having been written by a professional historian. If this author is going to write about other issues concerning the JFK assassination other than the Zapruder film, I think it would have been appropriate to include the historical background.Most people interested in the assassination are usually aware of the critical importance of the historical situation surrounding JFK's death. I'm referring specifically to the Cold War, the formation and rise to power of the CIA, the Cuban problem, etc.This author, for example, does not bother to inform his readership what it already knows, that is, that C. D. Jackson of Time/Life, apparently so ""powerful"" a man that the Warren Commission was not able to use its subpoena capabilities to retrieve the Zapruder film he so carefully pulled from public viewing, was a CIA asset. Any reader of the literature knows this, and knows exactly what this means. So what's wrong with Wrone? Is he one, too?"
1,Part of the cover up?,"The noted assassination researcher Harrison Livingstone has suggested in one of his later books that he thought the government of this country has co-opted the Kennedy assassination research community. In flipping through this total nonsense book, one can readily understand what he was referring to.Anyone who has any grasp of the essential facts in this case understands what Wrone has done using his slippery command of the language.I would suggest to the professor that he take his ""evidential base"" and publish a second book, even if it wouldn't fit on one whole sheet of toilet paper.What has happened to this country, when people like this have grown up in it?"
1,Junk,"Another attempt to change history at the expense of a tragic day in history. Authors always come out of the woodwork around the anniversary of 11/22/63 and this one is no different than most because it just rehashes the same information into a new ""theory"" or ""myth"". Don't waste your time or money on this garbage."
4,WOW!!!!!,"I am partially handicapped and this handheld is slim enough that I can hold it comfortably in my hand. The choices of pressure & stream type.level is great. My only problem is the only mounting hardware requires me to drill holes into my wall to do so. That's fine but it would have been nice to also have the option to put it up on shower arm so it would be easier for my daughter & husband to use without them having to hold it in their hands or as we resorted to doing, using a small clamp to hold it until we finally purchased necessary arm adapter from hardware store to hold it up high"
1,Junk,"I've had this ""Deluxe"" model for under a year now. The handle is so narrow that it's hard to hold and direct where you need the spray because the hose so stiff, it's a constant fight. To top it off, the ""On/Off Switch"" broke in less than a year. It's an easy enough part to replace; you have to assemble it all in the beginning, but Invacare doesn't sell the replacement part.Buy a different brand!!!"
4,Sort of Useful???,"As all the editions that preceded this one, there's a list of all the universities under the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU), the major contact details for all universities in Commonwealth / ex-Commonwealth countries, and full departmental contact details for those who are ACU's members. The universities are listed under sections, one for each country. At the beginning of each section there's a short informative history of HE institutions in the country.OK. So it's useful, but in this age when the majority, if not all, of HE institutions are online and most departments have their own webpage, what is the point of having this big giant book (in 3 volumes, if I remember correctly) when you already have a big computer with internet connection sitting on your desk and you're dying for some extra desk space?"
4,"It's nice, for those who have hope","My father died of cancer about 6 months ago. My mother says the book is very helpful, even for those of us without cancer. It was very inspirational, and even though my father died anyway, it's good to take the book's advice early in life."
4,A Productive Appetizer,"This is a quick, easy read with basic, valuable informative for those unfamiliar with the differences between a Western medical approach to cancer (suppress the symptoms) and a holistic one (remove the cause).When my 8-year-old dog was diagnosed with cancer and given 6 weeks to live without surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, I instead followed the same holistic approach this book describes. Like this author, not only did my sweet canine survive, she thrived. Eleven years later, she died peacefully in my arms, 1 week before her 19th birthday.In my opinion, this is an important read for anyone who is unfamiliar with tissue cleansing or a live food diet. Why wait until you have cancer to read it? Read it now and drastically decrease the chances of ever getting cancer!"
1,Cruel and Exploitive Nonsense,"The author sells false hope to cancer patients. The trade off for this false hope is a horrible way for terminal cancer patients to end their final days. Actually have *fewer* days since the enemas and diets promoted by this detoxer naturopath will rob patients of calories when they need then most.There are monsters out there that know they can sell anything to desperate people, especially if they dress it up in religion.It is far better to get real medical care, drink milk shakes, and spend your hard-earned money on a beach vacation."
5,Old Memories,I was raised on the music of the 40's and 50's and this CD brings back all of those memories. I truly enjoy listening to this CD and reminisce of times gone by. It brings back pictures in my mind of my family that are no longer with me. If you are a child of the 40's I know you will enjoy it.
3,Disappointment,"I listened to some of the songs before I bought this CD, but was disappointed in the selections when I got them in my player. Learn for others!"
1,Anything but Royal,This was a very disappointing CD on several counts: 1) The recording was very weak--equivalent to an AM broadcast: 2) The All-World band seemed to sleep-walk their way through an unispiring performance; and 3) Arturo Sandoval (the reason I purchased the CD in the first place) had a very minor role and his brilliance could not save this boring self-indugent effort on the part of the band. The only thing worse than purchasing this CD would be to have been in Royal festival Hall on that fateful night.
2,Not as described!,"Does not fold down to 12 inches. Also weighs 2.5 lbs on the tag. Yes it can be a big deal when backpacking. Not happy with this. On a different note, I found that it is also not very comfortable, and my next one will have a small backrest on it. My fault there."
1,Incorrect product description,"I bought this stool because the description said it folds to 12"". IT DOES NOT. It is 24"". Otherwise, seems like a nice stool."
1,Item broke after 6 months; Manufacturer will not respond,"I bought this item in June 2006 for a camping trip to Bass Lake, CA.The chair worked very well for several months. However the plastic composite fulcrum piece which holds the legs in place split in half while sitting on it in my house. I slightly tweaked my back when I fell. I only weight 190 lbs. I think it may have been defective. I emailed the manufacturer and they did not respond."
4,Excellent recording quality...,"A strong entryway into the work of a talented American composer. I was blown away by the Tempest Fantasy, and I find that the Time Gallery is somewhat too literal in its inspirations. It's lengthier, and doesn't seem as continuously inventive. The Ariel Fantasy that you hear (the genesis of the first movement of the Tempest Fantasy) seems much more unforced, and the inspiration is continuous, quicksilver, and the development seems more organic and natural. The playing serves the music ideally, and it's always great to hear more of this very individual, accessible, and communicative composer."
1,THE REVIEWER,"I CHOSE TO READ THIS BOOK ,BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES ,LONG SHOT.I REALLY LLLLOOOOOVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEDDDDDDD THIS BOOK,BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED READING IT,I THOUGHT ABOUT ME PLAYING ON THE BASKETBALL TEAM.I WANTED TO PLAY BASKETBALL.MY RATING FOR THIS BOOK -ONE THROUGH TEN.IS TEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I ALWAYS WANTED TOPLAY BASKETBALL,AND IT GOT BETTER AS I READ."
5,Excellent Practice Arrows,"They fly straight and true. This is my second box of 12, and I do not have one complaint. Don't waste your money on the 'plastic' alternative to save a couple of bucks. Those arrows do not fly, they meander- to the point of being a danger. I threw an entire box away."
4,great arrows for the price,"these are great arrows for target practice. affordable, and they work.I ordered some Easton fiberglass ones at the some time and these seem to work as well or better. very happy with the purchase."
5,Wildly provocative,"This is a wildly creative and provocative book by one of the greatest artists of our time. Wosk's work is unique, authentic and exquisite. Every mixed media artist or collector should have this book."
2,Maybe it's a matter of style,"I don't go for overwrought/cabbage rose/let's-see-how-many-little-items-we-can-fit art, but that's just me. Even if I liked her style and if I appreciated pics of Wosk working and her studio, I'd have been way less than impressed with the quality of the book itself. My first thought when I pulled it out of the box was that it had the look and feel of a child's Golden Book. It got one extra star only bcz maybe it is mostly a matter of style and opinion. Oh, BTW, I sent it back."
4,All the best songs at half the price,"This is consumate Kendalls stuff...all their biggest hits at a nice price without a bunch of cover material that they did well, but which is highly unnecessary to own! ENJOY"
4,Excellent for archiving old videos,"This unit excels when it comes to copying old vcr tapes especially SVHS types. We had a tape that the edge of the magnetic tape had become stretched and wavy when closely examined. It actually was so bad that the tape would not play in the equipment that recorded it. This unit copied the tape perfectly with the exception that the audio was muffled, but that is where the audio is stored...on the tape edge. I was very impressed with its abilities. The only thing I wish JVC would have done, was to add the ability to create icons at the beginning of the DVD for different chapters on the disc. Other units do this. Otherwise I rate this unit excellent."
2,more problems than its worth,"This unit has been in the shop 3 times, going on the fourth in a years time.They supposedly upgraded the DVD drive but I just found out that they only changed out the dvd changing mechanism. Now the dvd has gone out again. This time warranty is out. When I bought the unit it was advertised with a 2 year warranty. Turns out there is only one year.Pretty good recording though but very picky about the DVD's it plays.The unit is also not a grounded UL approved unit. It has a grounded plug but inside the unit it is terminated on a dead pin on the power board.Wiothout a local service center it cost me over $50 in shipping fees for the warranty repairs."
2,bad mixer for serious scratch djs,"have had to replace the crossfader twice in barely a year! the fader im on now i have only had for about 2 months and it is almost useless now...not sure what the deal is but i dont practice THAT much. everything else is fine but since it's advertised as a ""turntablist dj mixer"" i thought i should let people know..."
4,Sit back and enjoy it and stop complaining!,"I bought this when it was released and recently went back to view it again. For what it is, it is actually pretty good. My perspective on it may be different from the average viewer. You have to respect the filmmaker who writes, produces and directs the film, among other jobs. He performed all aspects of the production save for the music and a few minor jobs. That is no easy task. This is a party film, plain and simple. So grab your beverage, sit back with the lights off and enjoy!"
1,not worth it,"unfortunately this was an amateur movie in every sense of the word. poor production, poor acting, poor, poor, poor. don't waste your time, let alone your money on this tripe."
4,An eye-opening guide to effective ways to make change,"Bill Domhoff has spent his career trying to figure out how America really works. Unlike other scholars, he's never been satisfied with just a good story -- he's always been eager to put different theories to test and figure out which is really right. In this book, he uses that lifetime of knowledge to answer a crucial question for anyone who wants a better world: how do we make a difference in politics.I thought I knew a lot about this subject -- and indeed, he ends up coming to the same basic conclusion I did -- but Domhoff challenges some of the basic assumptions of the left, including that the biased media is a practical problem.For those who want to take a look, much of the book is available from Domhoff's website at [...]"
3,okay,"i ordered two of these ferns. when they arrived one was in good condition and looked great. the other one was taped into the pot using masking tape, it did not have the round bottom leaf that a staghorn has, thus i would be afraid to reorder this plant. i have them in my kitchen hung over my sink, for the humidity. i will see how they do."
5,it actually works!,"I have a five year old bichon who has terrible skin allergies. He ate a bunch of acorns in the yard and it totally changed him. His fur is not the same consistancy or his disposition. I have tried everything but I refused to go the steroid route. I put him on ""dermatabs"" and bathe him with this weekly and its like a miracle. His fur is now coming back & he is not uncomfortable anymore. He's actually looking more ""full"" like a bichon and prances a little. Thank goodness for this stuff, if you have a dog with allergies try this, it truly works wonders."
3,Mystery of the galloping ghost,"Plot would have be pretty good, but felt rushed and not fully formed for a classic Trixie Belden. But since it was the last and only book of the series I hadn't read...it was a must read."
5,Binkow Plays in Peoria,"Binkow calls us to action again with a ""just do it"" approach to listening. Whether it be business or family, Binkow is the final push that actually makes us practice what the other gurus of listening have been begging us to do. Short, sweet, and effective."
5,Awsome system.,"Now this is more like it. I replaced the defective DAV-FX10 with this system. WOW what a difference. This system has a real subwoofer and fills my large family room with all the sound crisp and clear and base you really feel. I didn't use the speaker wires that came with it, I had 14 ga. wire already wired into the walls."
4,not bad. 6.1 effect kicks butt,"this is my first htib. i chose this set because the reviews were good, deal was good, set had pretty much most basic features like digital inputs, optical input etc and 1000w power. You wont get 1000w just like that. It depends on the input stream - dvd, surround cable or regular cable.so far impressed with sound quality, bass effect etc. The remote is a little hard to get adjusted, and the speaker wires are pretty mediocre. System appearance is good except for the mega sized swoofer. Overall i would say this is a bang for the buck."
2,"Great sound output, but...","The amp is great, and fills the room with sound. I can hook up everything I have, and room to spare. Except for one thing, I would rate this at five stars, however, the system is only as good as it's weakest component, which happens to be the DVD player. I had it for a month and one day the DVD player would not power up. I bought the system at Best Buy, and they were happy to replace the ENTIRE SYSTEM, but not just the DVD player. So I took it all apart and hauled it all back in to them and got a new system, hooked it all back up...well, another month passed and the exact same problem, this time the system swallowed two brand new DVD's with no way to get them out. The response was, again, to bring in the entire system and they will replace it. What a bother, running all the wires, hooking and unhooking everything, etc. If I could just get the DVD player replaced it would be better. Anyway, buy with caution and make sure you get the extended warranty from your retailer."
3,"Good, but not as good as expected","After reading lots of reviews, this one seemed to be it. Setup was easy and no problems.Playing four DVD's on it, the sound was good but I have to run it as 96% volume to get a good sound out. Anything below 50% one can hardly hear. Playing a CD, the volume is twice as loud, i'm not sure why there is a difference.The auto decoder seems to not select the right coding, manually changing the setting produces a much better sound than the auto selected one. Still thinking of returning this, as on the odd time I want to shake the house I have no volume left!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I have had problems with this unit since I got it. DVDs pause in the middle of a movie. Once this happens the system will not play again and other functions (on/off, eject, etc.) are very slow to respond. I tried living with this sporadic performance until it was too late. When it did function properly the sound was pretty good."
4,"Compelling, informative and well thought out","Ms.Gray has written a taunt , well thought out perspective on Roger Corman. She brings to the work a definite opinion which is refreshing and well thought out .I would make this volume compulsory reading for any true student of B Cinema."
5,Corman Exposed,"Wow! Talk about switching personalities! This amazing biographer can emit the style of the person she is writing about to really give you a flavor of the personality. And of course, she spent time working for him, so you are privy to more of a view. Written somewhat bruskly like Roger's personality, you really gain insight into his life and what made him the person he is. Contrast this book with Beverly's biography of Ron Howard and you see some of the exceptional talent of this lady. A great read!"
5,rauncy,"I love Mary Ann Mitchell books, but they are hard to find. She is a must read author as long as you don't mind any steamy action"
1,Bloody Awful,"It's gotten to where I'm almost afraid to pick up a vampire novel anymiore because so many of them are just so bad. This was no exception. I thought the premise of the Maruis de Sade as a vampire might prove interesting but the writer obviously knows very little of the historical character and managed to make him a good deal less interesting in undeath than he was in life. Ditto for the fictional characters that populate the book. They were so painfully boring I kept hoping they'd all die a grisly death. No such luck however. In short, don't waste your money or your time on these books. Anne Rice may have gotten predictible as her books went along but at leat the woman could write! This one can't and it shows. Painfully."
3,Enjoyable but... there is better,I find that some topics are not explained very profoundly.I truly prefer Futuyma's book.
2,Technical evolutionary biology,"The neo-darwinian evolutionary synthesis has been called a genetic takeover. This book testifies to the truth of this dictum. Genes are of the utmost importance. EVOLUTION is not so much about evolution as teaching theoretical evolutionary biology without much feeling for practical evolutionary research or the natural world. As an introductory textbook, Ridley's book will succeed in making students avoid evolutionary biology, as a subject full of theoretical debates with little biological sense"
5,Four Great Films & One Misfire,"This set is worth owning just for Mame, in which Lucille Ball BECOMES Auntie Mame. DuBarry Was A Lady, Dance Girl Dance (with a young Maureen O'Hara) and The Big Street are all fan favorites. While Lucy looks stunning in Critic's Choice, it is the least enjoyable film in the set (and the only ""stinker"" out of four films she made with her preferred screen-partner, Bob Hope)."
5,"We love Lucy, and she deserves it!","It was so enjoyable watching Lucille Ball in the years before, and after, she became the one and only Lucy. It's a shame typecasting prevented her from being able to take on the wide range of roles she had before ""I Love Lucy,"" because the world seems to have forgotten what a brilliantly accomplished actress she really was. Lucy handled dramatic and sentimental roles just as capably as the screwball comedy she became known for once television came along."
3,poor review,"I am back again with a poor review not on the movies, because I have yet to receive the collecttion and it has been over a month again that it was ordered. I sure hope someone is checking in on what has happened to the order. If someone can get back to me via email I sure would appreciate it I am giving a poor rating on the service."
2,Watch out for Chinese DVDs,"It seems to me like this is not a DVD but rather a CDV converted to DVD. The image quality is bad, so is the sound and there is some text underneath the picture all the time. but this is the only place I could find this film, great work by director Johnnie To with all the usual HK stars."
5,"JOHNNY TO, OPUS 24","***** 1999. Produced and directed by Johnny To. Hong Kong Film award earned by Johnny To in the Best Director category in 2000 and five other nominations. Five men are hired by a Hong Kong mob boss to protect him when unknown hitmen try to kill him. In my opinion, Johnny To is one of the most interesting directors in activity nowadays, he's used to shoot two or three movies a year and he is already responsible for such masterpieces asFull Time Killer,Running Out of TimeorPTU: Police Tactical Unit. The scene in the mall is a little jewel of mise-en-scene and, at the end of the film, we have the strange impression that if one of the bodyguards should be hurt, the other ones would also bleed. Masterpiece."
4,The Mission,"Gee, what can you say about the Hong Kong Cinema without Johnny To's recent works since ""The Longest Night"" and it reaches the zenith with ""The Mission"". It shows to the world that Hong Kong cinema needs no more car explosion, heavy stunt or self-sacrificial performances to draw the attention, but a solid story and concrete charactors. The world depicted in the film is originated in the traditional ways of samurai, in which people not just loyal to their bosses, but their deed! Yes, it has the overtone of Kurosawa's films, but still better than always eating the cheap hollywood elements.... A MUST SEE for anyone intested in the Hong Kong Cinema."
4,Its Good but.....,I think the story is good. The action is a little lacking though. I thought the musical score was a bit unprofessional as well. Another problem is I don't speak Cantonese which made reading the subtitles a chore because they move really fast. Good movie though. I liked it.
3,Interesting,"Book is interesting but probably would not recommend it. I wanted to purchase another, similar, book by an author recommended in our local Miniature World Museum, but was too expensive."
2,"Great Concept, But Save Your Money","Did you ever buy a book that absolutely exceeded your expectations? Well, you won't get that feeling from this book.Although the introductory material was quite interesting (i.e., how the dollhouse-crime scene technique is used in training forensic science students), the remainder of the book is slow-paced dribble with scant references to actual photos of the dollhouse crime scenes. I just expected so much more; the introductory page to each of the scenarios shows the actual dollhouse scene that accompanies the vignette, but they are too amateurish, and anyone who has ever watched a complete 60-minute episode of any prime-time cop and/or court show would be able to describe the scene and investigation, perhaps with even more vivid detail and creativity than the author of these drab tales. C+ at best."
1,"Nice duster, but they don't know how to size them in China","I've wanted a good Australian duster for years -- ever since I first saw Tom Selleck where one in Quigly - Down Under. I finally got around to buying this one, and when it arrived, it was AT LEAST 2 sizes too small. I mean... it wasn't even close and I needed to lose a few pounds. I returned the product and received a refund in a reasonable period of time, but based on my experience, I'd say avoid this product (but not the supplier - I've bought other things from them and it's been good)."
4,A good place to start learning about networkig.,"Is there someone in your office who wants to know how networks work? Do you have trouble explaining the concepts? Do you need a more visual approach? Well Cisco Press has created an excellent teaching tool for you.In about 250 pages you will have pictures and diagrams to explain complex terms and concepts. You'll be able to show the novice what happens with ATM, firewalls, QoS and more.I found it easy to read and comprehend. Written for the introduction level user, there might be a thing or two that the advanced user could use. Overall a good starting place for those interested in breaking into the networking industry."
4,Great book,"At times people in networking field know how to get one thing fixed or run, but don't know how it actually working or what is making it run. This book just takes you to basic and tell you all about it. I would suggest this book for anyone who is in networking field and think he needs to learn the basics on how things actually work.Good for anyone who wants to move to networking field and understand how networking works."
2,Looks good but very bad quality,This coffee table and side tables look good but is very bad quality.. Also it wasn't shipped properly.. I received with broken corners of the table tops.. After 6 months of use two of the legs broke.. I fixed it somehow with screws... but I never know when it would break again as its shaking! Wood is of very bad quality!Its a waste of money! Please do not buy!
2,Extremely Disappointed!,"Purchased this Party Time Karaoke CD (along with 2 other Party Time Cds, a ""100's Hits"" karaoke Cd and the ""Singing Machine"" Karaoke player) for my daughter's graduation party, it arrived three days before the party and boy am I glad I played these prior. The music was not all that good and the lyrics were missing, blurred and running over each other. Incidentally, the ""100's Hits"" Party Karaoke CD played without any problems. Poor quality and I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone, waste of money."
3,"Cheaply made, but does the job","Cheaply made, cramped space, doesn't seem like it can take much of a beating. Nice for stationary, but not so much if you're gonna be luggin it around and expect it to hold up or not pop open."
5,Exquisite Set!!!,"Sometimes you are obviously taking a chance when you buy this kind of item online without seeing it in person first. Bought another set previously that I had to send back because it just didn't look as nice in person. They came and picked it up because the top plates were broken and it was too heavy to take to the post office. But this set! Absolutely exquisite. Every dish perfectly made, not a single problem. The platinum was beautiful. I use these dishes every day, very hardy set as long as you just use common sense and you're careful. Washes easily. Looks stunning whether you're doing a casual table or formal. Very Satisfied!!!"
2,a good read but seriously flawed,"If you read the reviews which gave this book five stars you will discover few of the readers cite any actual weight loss they have experienced by following the book's advice. Instead they go on about how motivational the book is. I agree. It is a very entertaining read and Susan Powter comes across as an engaging personality. However her basic premise , that you can consume virtually unlimited quantities of food so long as it is low in fat is errant nonsense. You CAN'T.It is perfectly possible to get tubby on brown rice if you pile your plate high. Compare with reviewers of books which shun the high carb/ low fat myth - Protein Power and suchlike. You will find most of the reviewers have tried the diets and actually lost weight."
1,Mistake. BIG mistake.,"Great motivator although I got really tired of the ex-husband bashing. Also, there are some serious oversights on her part. Go ahead and eat all the bagels you want. If it works for you, congratulations. I wonder what new spin she'll put on this stuff for her latest get rich scheme."
3,"Good advice, but hard to follow","The basic premise of a low fat diet is that you get more ""bang for your buck"". However, I'm sensitive to most grains, and find that the recipes did little to satisfy my hunger. I kept wanting to eat more and more. I was hungry practically every hour on the hour. I find that if I just have a small portion of the actual taste I am longing for, like a bit of olive oil drizzled on green beans with some baked chicken, I get exactly what I want in the taste I want, and don't need to go back, and I feel satisfied and not stuffed. I don't like feeling hungry all the time. Sure, I could eat larger portions cutting the fat, but I am more of a quality, not quantity person. When I cut the fat that low, my skin and hair got a bit drier, (I've got naturally dry skin and hair due to hypothyroidism).The nutritional advice in this book is very good, and she is very knowledgeable about food and exercise. She managed to lose a lot of weight, but this diet won't work for everyone."
4,"EAT, BREATHE, AND MOVE...","susan powter has energy, and she loves to talk. what she says in 250+ pages, can be summarized in one sentence: IN ORDER TO BE LEAN, STRONG, AND HEALTHY, WE MUST EAT, BREATHE, AND MOVE. i am not sure if this book would be categorized as autobiography or health and nutrition. it is at times, almost a stream of her consciousness... but susan powter is a bright woman and for the sake of helping others, she definitely wants to share her story about how she finally succeeded at weightloss. i respect people who call it like they see it and so i enjoyed reading her book."
5,great book,This is a great book I've kept in my library for years. I loaned it out & never got it back so I replaced it. Everything in it still applies !
3,it's ok,"i like the songs drive, say ok,and afraid. but what annoys me is her voice! she sounds like she's crying or whining. she sang in high school musical so now she thinks she can sing period. she should stick to acting. and with her voice she shouldn't try to have the hip hop thing going on. so though she sounds like a 4 yr old those three songs are good. you should check them out."
1,A travesty.,"What is this garbage? Manufactured trash by Disney Channel is reaching the apex of my nerves. First of all, I was impressed with Vanessa's performance on the Disney Channel hit ""High School Musical"" but that's about as good as it gets for her. None of these songs are good, it's all been done before.Her voice is digitally enhanced to the point where she sounds like a robot half of the song! A little bit of enhancement is acceptable, but not to this extent. I really don't think anybody will be able to relate to this music. She has a rather mediocre voice, nothing spectaucular. Wouldn't waste your money on this one."
1,WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER ACTRESS TURNED SINGER!!!,"Disney channel seems to think that if they can act, they can sing. NOT TRUE! Vanessa Hudgens practically mumbles the song ""Psychic"". ""Let Go"" sounds almost identical to ""Say OK"". Vanessa, you should probably act more because singing doesn't seem to work.I can't see her having a long term career. She'll probably become yesterday's news as soon America's obsession with ""High School Musical"" fades away. I doubt she'll ever be known as anything besides ""That girl from 'High School Musical'"" and she can't milk that forever."
2,Her 15 minutes are running out...,"I'm just waiting for this undertalented chick to fade into the spotlight, but at least the nude photos show her for who she really is: A crappy role model for the tweenage girls who look up to her the most and somebody who is really just pathetic. Her voice is mediocre at best and the material sounds just like something that was left off a Lindsay Lohan album. And if you are a parent who is buying this for your little girl I have two words for you: Please don't. Don't waste your money and don't expose your children to somebody who has to send skanky photos to her boyfriends just so they don't leave her for somebody better. Check out BarlowGirl, Rebecca St. James, Paramore, Ayiesha Woods, even Aly & AJ, who have ladies that can sing, write, and behave decently.(I'm using my dad's account though, I'm actually 17)."
2,SILLY!,"I did was not expecting anything when my friend Pedro, let me borrow this cd, but I didn't think it was going to turn out this bad! Ashley Tisdale's album is so much better and I thought that album was going to be worst.1. ""Come Back to Me""-just ok not amazing (one line of the song was kind of copying one of Avril Lavine's song)2.""Let go""- BORING!3. ""Say Ok""- I actually really like this song.4.""Never Underestimate a girl""-girl power has been done million of times before5.""Let's Dance""- Used for the promo of ""Dancing with the Stars""6.""Drive""- I like it until the chorus begins7. ""Afraid""- ANOTHER BORING SONG!8.""Promise""- Does not make any sense9.""Whatever Will Be""- completely different song10.""Rather be with you""-very blah11.""Psychic""-not as bad as the other songs on this CD.11.""Lose your love""-sounds just like psychic."
4,"OK, here's the deal...","Vanessa Hudgens is a pretty girl with an Ok voice. But on some songs, she just sounds whiney and nazel! The absulte WORST song on here was PHYSIC. So stupid and lame and kidish. None of my friends like it either. It is horrible! I doubt anyone will like it! DRIVE and NEVER UNDERESTIMAT A GIRL are my two faves. I like more, but these are really good. Along with RATHER BE WITH YOU, they're the best.In "" Let Go,"" she says and I quote, "" 'Cause at my best and at my worst, yea, you've already seen it. Let down your hair, the h**l who cares...""I don't know why Vanessa would say that. Probably millions of kids will buy this and she says that. Just DUMB MOVE VANESSA!!!! That was a bad move.Parents: JUST BEWARE OF THAT. OTHERWISE, IT'S A PRETTY GOOD CD!I recomade it. If you liked her in High School Musical, you should like her in the CD...."
2,Vanessa Hudgens - Is she a role model for kids?,"Vanessa Hudgens - Gabriella Montez on the DCOM, High School Musical. MANY kids love(d) this movie. And there is going to be a HSM 2. Vanessa would have gotten many fans because of this so they would follow her music career. But after listening to this album, I don't think that her lyrics are quite appropriate for young girls. So, I'm suggesting that if you want to buy this for your child, you should do a lyrics search for this album before buying it."
2,Where's The Pop!,"After the mind boggling success of High School Musical you would assume one would stick with what they are good at, Pop!However this cannot be said for Miss Vanessa A Hudgens who appears to have tried to fit too many genres on the one CD. From romantic slow ballads she goes to RnB and then just throws in a few Pop songs although the genre would most likely be the genre most well recieved by her fan base."
1,Marketed to KIDS and TWEENS?,I can't believe Disney markets this trash to Kids. She swears on the album! In what world does Disney think it's OK to have your kids running around singing swear words?
1,NOT impressed....,"Vanessa Anne Hudgens in High School Musical was great, but I listened to all of the clips available for her CD and saw the Come Back to Me music video, and was NOT IMPRESSED. Not only does the 2nd song have a curse word in it (it's on the clip, too), but all of the songs are either strange-sounding or depressing. :-P"
3,A Beautiful Voice Remains Hidden,"After hearing this wonderfully talented young woman singing `When There Was Me And You' in `High School Musical', I went and bought this album.This is a CD which grows on you. The songs ""Come back to me"", ""Say OK"", ""Drive"" & ""Whatever Will Be"" are actually very nice to listen too. The rest are OK but could have been better.I hope that as she matures as a singer and actress, the music she releases will come to emphasize her voice more as she has great potential."
2,Sounds Fake,"I like Vanessa Hudgens and i would never judge because of what she did,i think she's a beautiful girl and i'm huge fan of HSM.The thing is...the album sounds very fake after what she did, i can't get out of my head the song ""Say Ok"" especially the line ""I'm not like all my friends who keep calling up the boys, I'm so shy""I know guys, sounds very fake.I fell i little betrayed because my 8 years brother really likes her and he's always hearing her cd and i never told him the truth, i think it's better this way.The cd has some good pop songs like ""Come Back To Me"" but this isn't enough to save the album."
5,Daughter is very pleased,"My daughter had me order this CD two weeks before it came out and is very pleased with it. The first few weeks she had it I would hear the radio in her room playing very loud, and with out doubt. She loves the CD I got for her."
1,Feeding off of HSM explosion,She is nasal. She is weird. She is cute but tries to hard in her videos. We loved her form HSM. But do we love her THIS much? Not really. Do we WANT to hear her whine and screech? No.Your ears will thanks you if you skip this one. She acts well and should stick to it. But no one can these days can they?MESSAGE 2 DISNEY: NOT EVERYONE CAN SING.~Attina
2,Nothing new,"I checked this CD out of the library because my daughter (age 10) loved the music from HSM. She quickly got bored listening to the CD and I think we returned it without ever finishing it. Vanessa's voice is fine, but no different than Britney, Lindsey, Hillary, etc. I'm glad we didn't spend money on this CD. Will look forward to seeing Vanessa in HSM2, but prefer her in an ensemble cast as opposed to a solo artist."
2,OK,"I was disappontied there are alot of slow songs on the album, and also she said a cuss word in track 2 i think the word she said isnt bad if you put in a way of what it is but the way she put it made it bad, i really liked Vanessa till i found that out i dont think she is a role model anymore. my favorite songs are ""Never underestmiate a girl"" and ""lets dance"""
3,"""V"" is an amazing debut.","Vanessa Hudgens; star of ""High School Musical"", releases her debut album ""V"" which features the amazing single ""Come Back To Me"". Her album features great music like ""Say OK"", ""Afraid"", and ""Make You Mine"". I love Vanessa, even though she says 'hell', its not really a bad word like the rest of the curse-word vocabulary."
4,Lovely-I really liked this,"I really like this cd.I think vanessa put her all in this.My favorite songs are ""Say Ok"" and ""Come Back To Me""."
3,"Great Voice, OK Album","I think she has a better voice than Ashley, but as for this first solo album, not better than Headstrong. Its a bit of a shame that it falls so short of what was expected. The songs aren't as thrilling or as catchy. You have to really get into it to love the album as a whole. Do yourself a favor and just get the fan favorites on iTunes."
5,Wonderful,"I love this album. Although ""Come Back to Me"" was not the best choice for her first single, I still think that Vanessa has a lot of talent. I would have to say my favorite songs on V were ""Drive"", ""Promise"" and ""Never Underestimate a Girl"". I don't think she is just ""one of those Disney girls"" who thinks they can sing, Vanessa has real talent unlike some actresses on Disney Channel who just sing to be considered a triple threat, Vanessa actually is a as she demonstrated in High School Musical."
5,"Great Voice, Great Looks!","She's not only pretty, she's also talented - singing, dancing or even hosting? Her album shows off a different side of her - funky, wild and hot, unlike what she was in High School Musical - a brainy and quiet girl. There are songs that are nice to dance to, ballads and others. Great album indeed. It was worth the wait! Go Vanessa! :) I'm sure your album will have good sales and you've got a bright future ahead!"
5,Just in Time !,"Vincent Cole's book, The Next Step in Evolution, can be read for information or really used as a personal guide when one is going through transitional periods. I found it to be very informative and comforting at times. Not only is it affirming but it is also a great guide to taking the next step and evaluating where one has been. I have given it as a gift to a friend and plan to give several more copies to friends who are at cross roads in life. The old saying of "" the teacher appears when the student is ready"" is very apt in the case of this book for me. Honestly, I was ready for ho-hum and was very pleasantly surprised and gratified by the level of the concepts, explanations and writing style. It is a wonderful addition to our library on understanding the human condition ! Bravo to the author !"
1,an ok book,"The Eye, the Ear, and the Arm had a good plot. It's about three children and their adventure. I found it rather boring because it had too many details. The only reason I read it is because it was required for school."
3,An okay book,"The Ear, The Eye, and The Arm is a mix between a sci-fi and a fantasy. It takes place in the country of Zimbabwe in the year 2914. It starts off with three kids (sons and daughter of the general) named Tendai, Kuda, and Rita that get bored of their ""normal"" life and decide to go out and have a little adventure of their own. All of a sudden they are kidnapped and sent to work for the ""She Elephant"". If the don't escape, they will be bought by the masks to sere in their gang. They have to use bravery, wits, and trust to escape.Overall I would give this book three stars because it had a pretty good plot, but it wasnt that interesting."
3,Boring,The book is so hard to read because it is very boring for the first 100 pages. You feel like you would rather watch BARNEY than read this.
5,great dvd,My son loves wonderpets. This dvd kept him entertained on a long plane ride. Product arrived on time. No complaints.
2,Formulaic and disappointing.,"The comparison another reviewer makes with Mary Higgins Clark is apt. Shallow characters, predictable plot twists, and writing on the level of a high-school junior. It is incredible how the author runs out of gas for the final chapter and brings all the threads together in a couple of pages. If one didn't know better, and I don't, it would appear that the publisher told her she had only two more pages to use so she'd better finish it up. Or maybe the author was just too lazy to write a credible ending."
4,loving mother - son bond,"If you are looking for a delightful book that shows a loving relationship between a little boy and his mom, you've found it. In this book, you spend a day with Jonathan and his mom as they take a stroll. While they walk through the city, they play games, sing, act silly and just have a great time with one another. The illustration is done in a muted watercolor and not very bold but still quite colorful. Overall, with few lines to a page it makes a nice read for any bedtime story packed with a dose of love."
5,Teachers LOVE this book!,"I, Gwyn R. C. Moses, would like to share how much the preschoolers I work with enjoy Jonathan and His Mommyread aloud. I extended the story by having them mimic the steps using sidewalk chalk, created language experience books, and so important have given the 3-4 year olds an opportunity to explore writing by drawing the strokes to represent the steps taken. The products from the read alouds have been awesome.[...]"
1,remote not working,did not work will not program to truck.if u can help let me know what to do ? thank you
2,"Mr Sche has better albums out, this is not one !","Suppose to be a collection of Mr Sche's best songs and it isn't. Grey Goose with Al Kapone and Eightball isn't even his, he didn't even produce it. There were some good songs, All WE GOT, WE GETTIN CRUNK snippet, WHAT I AM, WORLD MOVIN SO FAST, and couple of others. Being from Memphis though I heard Mr Sche with some real bumpin' tracks on other albums that weren't on his CD. Plus it advertising a DVD with his videos, which are great low budget stuff, but there is NO DVD, No VIDEOS !!"
4,Outstanding Images and a great story,"This graphic novel by Frank Miller and Bill Sienkiewicz is one heck of a story. The graphic art complements this story as you are moved by the images. The story is compelling as it pschological moves you to uderstand each character. The art work is splended as you are fed with the right amount of colors, with th eright kind of colors depending on the situation.This is a pschological drama and therefore, action is noticably missing. Don't misuderstand me, there are a couple of scenes, but the hero is not well represented in this area. This I think is to a fault. After all, one does expect certian things from certian charaters. With Daredevil, you expect a human drama with some action.All in all, however, that may be more a matter of taste then principle and it should not stop any collector from getting this book. The story represents the mind as well as the soul of humans: good vs evil. An old story, but done with originality."
4,Great album,I have been listening to The Police and Sting since the mid eighties. This collection of hard-to-find songs is a must for Sting fans. Trying to go out and find the songs individually proved to be problematic. Definitely worth the price.
5,boots,I bought this boot for my son in construction and he was delighted with the quality. He will be wearing them on a daily basis
4,Run small,"First of all, I love the boots. My only problem is that I wear a men's US 10M. The boots fit like a 9 1/2. I like them enough I gave the 10s away and ordered 11s. If you are unsure, try on some DMs at a shoe store before you order. I am in Afghanistan, so no stores here. If they had fit properly, I would give them 5 stars."
1,sizing issues,"Chinese made = inconsistent sizing even within the same pair of Dr Marten's. Ordered two different pairs and neither one fit. The first pair, the right boot was too tight and the left was perfect. The second go round it was the opposite. Unless you like making several trips to the UPS store, save your money! DR. Marten's should have kept their manufacturing in the UK!!!!!"
4,Dr. Martens Boots,Item arrived in good condition boots were in a box labeled (gaucho which is the color ordered) but the boots were black .Would have liked the color that we ordered but didn't want to return item just because of the color since they were work boots.
2,What a Disappointment!,"Doc Martens now come from China?!? What happened to the company pride of manufacturing in England? They definitely compromised quality for a cheaper make. The insoles no longer provide comfort and support. The leather is less supple. Also the sizes are a bit different, so obviously they have different tooling (China-made probably). What a disappointment!"
1,WARNING!!!! Do NOT buy!,"Very poor quality!I have loved Docs for a long time but these are awful quality.The Good:Styling, very cool looking, classic doc Marten sole.Shipping and service was quick.ComfortableThe Bad:After wearing less than ten times the seam in the front of the left boot is coming apart. Not a little seperation, completely falling apart.What the hell?!The Dr. Marten shoes I've known and loved in the past were great quality, long lasting boots that were well worth the price. Apparently this is no longer the case! Most glaring difference that I am going to attribute the awful build quality to is the MADE IN CHINA tag, gone are the days of quality made in England I suppose.VERY Very disappointed!"
2,Can't get them on! WT...?,"I have been wearing Doc's for the better part of 20 years. I love them, love the quality. Now, these seem made as well as any other docs. And I have been wanting a pair like this for a while, so I finally ordered a pair. My excitement of my new boots was VERY short lived, since I couldn't even get them on! I ordered the same size as every other pair of Docs I own. They sent me the right size, but I couldn't get my foot in. It was like they were a size too small. I tried, and pulled, and forced, and wedged... but couldn't get my foot in. With disappointment, I clicked the ""Return or Replace Item"" button on the order screen, and they are currently on their way back to Amazon. Maybe if I was in a shoe store, and could try on a size larger and see if THAT is the trick I would try it... but not gonna waste time ordering another pair."
3,Beware the Kindle edition,"The Kindle edition had photos, tables and figures as far as the beginning of Chapter Two. After that, none. No pictures of the lures, hooks etc mentioned in the text. Despite being clearly written and very informative, without these illustrations, much value is lost.Can anyone suggest where or how I might be able to download the tables and figures separately?"
3,Average,"The cover and title are a bit misleading. I expected it to be more about sailing/cruising/fishing. The first few chapters offer great diagrams of rigs and lures but most of the book seems to be slanted toward the powerboat/offshore day fishing crowd. I wish the pictures would have been in color, the only color was on the cover"
2,Cruioser's Handbook,Book not that helpful with everyday tips on landing a big one. Book seems to stress exotic cool fishing methods that most of us will never use nor should be using. More time and illustrations should have been devoted to tying knots.
3,nice,i thought it was gonna be different but it's just like the one at the store..... which works perfectly fine
1,"Too Much Fluff, Lack of Concreteness","Have you ever read a book where halfway through it, your expectations begin dwindle because the author either did not cover the topic or promises to cover it in more detail in later chapters, but never does? If you ever feel this way about a book, then this is the perfect examples of those types of books.After reading the synopsis and browsing some of the crude methods that I can assimulate with when I was performing requirements modeling, I thought this book might come in handy. After close scrutiny, I was very disappointed by the authors lack of knowledge in UML. A lot of what was presented was very superficial, and the explanations were lacking in terms of it presentation of each of the models in UML. I should have stuck with the three authors (Jacobson, Booch, and Rumbaugh) who were the original designers of UML."
4,Living Zen,I really enjoyed this book. It gives a great overview of Zen and the illustrations are beautiful. It has lots of information about the history.
2,Slumber Bag is Very Thin,"Even though my nephew still liked this slumber bag, I found it to be very small and thin compared to other slumber bags I have purchased in the past. I realize that it is made to be used inside but it will not keep your little boy warm in places that have any type of cold weather."
5,Perfect for young girls,"My 8 year old daughter picked this CD when using some return credit. What a great choice for her! She loves the music and listens to the CD over and over. The songs are catchy and not offensive in any way, so as a parent I don't mind her singing and dancing along."
1,"You guessed it, more pop garbage","Nope, nothing different here. Same candy coated pop mush packaged under a different wrapper. I can't wait for the online revolution to send all record companies out of business and then there will be no one left to market and hype rubbish like this. Artists might have to actually be good to sell records. Imagine that!"
5,Hannah Rocks!,"This is a great CD for kids of all ages. My daughter loves it and I don't have to censor the words. And best of all, I can enjoy it with her because the songs are really great. I would highly recommend this CD."
3,Pretty Good CD A Teen's Review,"Well, I'm personally not a fan of Hannah Montana, but I do like her voice and her songs, so I bought this CD. I like the songs by her and a few of the others, but don't by this CD for more than $12 because it's not worth it unless your a crazy fan. I payed $16 for it because it came with 5 videos of her performing live. They're fun to watch... once. I would say, buy the CD for a good price and don't bother with the videos cause they're really not that great. Aside from the price, however, I really like the CD."
5,GREAT BUY!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 8YR OLD DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS, SHE LOVES THIS CD! GREAT MUSIC, SHE SINGS ALONG TO IT ALL THE TIME! SHE LOVES ""HANNA MONTANA""! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"I am 11, and although I only have 4 of the songs(on my iPod, I still know all the lyrics to all the songs. It has a positive message to everyone, and it is so catchy you can't help but play the songs over and over again! Highly recommended!"
4,Good but not great,This Cd is the first Cd I have ever gotten. I was a little disapointed that it wasn't all Hannah Montana songs but other than that it is good.
1,SHE IS A BIGGGGGG JOKE,"To me Hannah Montana is a big joke!!!!! She can't sing and I don't even see what's so amusing about her. Her show is better than her music(not by a whole lot) Miley tries to hard to be funny throughout the whole show. To me the show is would be just fine if she wasn't in it, and her music is just as bad. If you listen to her music some of the lyrics are confusing and just don't make since. For her to have all that money she needs to fire her producer AND HER STYLIST and get new ones!!"
3,Just what she wanted,"My 5 year old godchild only wanted this cd for christmas. She was so excited when she opened it. I was a bit taken aback when it wouldn't read on the new boombox I bought her. Once it was wiped down it did work, but it still needs to be wiped almost every time. I'm not sure if it is something with the cd or the boombox."
1,Pathetic Beyond Belief,"The daughter of a mullet-haired hick called Billy Ray Cyrus only gets her stardom because...well, she's the daughter of that guy. Miley Cyrus is a hick herself, and when it comes to a teenybopper music, she knows how to sell her schmuck to the middle school students. She can't sing to save her life, regardless of whatever you are told. She's just a Hilary Duff offshoot, but with a redneck accent.And I can tell you, I actually listened to part of her song. It cursed me. It raped my ears. It made me lose all of my shreds of sanity. Plus, it's on the Disney Channel, which has basically become a channel of generic, derivative and lifeless teen-based shows that use the same kid actors over and over. It's pathetic.Unless you want to lose your sanity for eternity, destroy your eardrums and make Walt Disney spin in his grave a couple more times, by all means should you purchase this. Just be warned when you're using this to support your drinking glass in a few months."
5,love it,I bought this book a long time ago and my son still loves to hear it regularly at bedtime. If your on the fence about this one i recommend you buy it.
5,Grandson loved it!,"I gave the book to my Grandson, along with the fireman costume I purchased through Amazon.com. While we were visiting, I must have read the book to him 30 times on his request. He loved it."
2,Should be hardcover at this price...,Definitely overpriced at nearing four bucks... seems like something you would find for a buck in the dollar rack at Target.
4,Big Frank's Fire Truck paperback,"Big Frank's Fire Truck paperback children's book is a little heavy on text for my three-year-old grandson, but he'll enjoy the pictures, and his parents will adapt the story to his level of comprehension. We gave him this book to go with the Melissa and Doug fireman's outfit. He shrieked with joy when he received it all and kept his fireman's outfit on all the time we were unwrapping Christmas gifts."
5,My son LOVES this book,"My son who is 2.5 years old and is very much into fire trucks nowadays, absolutely loves this book. Everytime when I ask which book he wants to read, he says ""Big Frank's Fire Truck!"" He's memorized pretty much the entire book. I'm now on the lookout for another fantastic book. He also loves Fireman Small."
4,Pretty nice,I'm new to the archery thing and these were cheap for one dozen. I haven't shot them yet but they look great! They are a total different color then what is advertized. I thought they were going to look like the picture but I got a black shaft with orange and white fletches. Its better then the green! I'm happier with them then I thought I would be.
2,Doesn't work as well as TV's built-in tuner,This card installed very easily and was able to set it up very well in media center but I dont think the tuner is very well built. When compared to my Sceptre LCD TV's built-in ATSC tuner during bad weather this card does not work well at all. The TV's built-in tuner is watchable during bad weather while the AverMedia card is not watchable at all using the same signal/antenna. I wrote to AverMedia technical support about this issue and they acknowledged that their tuner is not as good as a built-in TV tuner.
3,Easy to use but...,I bought this item knowing that it will work with a non-MCE XP machine. This is true. What was not true was that the card displays HD content. The maximum output for North American ATSC is 720x480. Nowhere near 1280x720 or 1920x1080i(540p). Other than that it works as advertised. A good value for the money even as a non-true HD card.
1,AVerMedia AVerTVHD MCE A180 Hi-Def TV Tuner Card (White Box),"I'm very disappointed in this card.I have not yet been able to get it to run. Apparently, even though I purchased my Media Center PC in 2005, it has Media Center PC 2004 edition and the card requires the 2005 Edition. Neither Microsoft nor HP (my PC's maker) provide an upgrade path to MCE 2005.The people at Aver Tech support were most unhelpful, and bordered on rude."
4,"nice product, easy installation","this was by far the cheapest HD-tuner card for windows mce 2005, and i am quite pleased w/ the performance. installation was straightforward, as was the setup in media center. i have had problems tuning some channels, but i believe that geography, not hardware, is causing my problems. definitely would recommend this to anyone who wants to add over the air hdtv broadcasts to their media center pc."
5,POWER METAL at it's BEST!!!,"If you're into old school power metal you will love this release. It is raw power in it's finest form! Bill Ramp has an INCREDIBLE voice and Jerry Watt's guitar playing is AWESOME. If you like Manowar you'll love it, although Axehammer's musicianship is much better. You won't find any technical Blind Guardian bore, just straight up POWERFUL HEAVY METAL. EXCELLENT songs. I would also HIGHLY recommend Axehammer's new CD ""WINDRIDER"" it is COMPLETELY FLAWLESS!\m/www.kuzindan.com www.myspace.com/kuzindanwww.magusbeast.com www.myspace.com/magusbeastwww.gothicknights.com www.myspace.com/gothicknights"
3,"IT IS METAL, BUT IT IS NOT GREAT","I have listened to some of the songs on this album and they are okay, but not great. They sound a litle bit like an undeveloped manowar or blind guardian. The music is not very technical and the singing is not done verry well. Besides this is is fine, only get it if you already have all the other metal cds you want."
3,Trance + House,"The first CD is great selection of trance, however there are so many tracks that they're all cut short and there's not time for any inspring mixing.The second CD is all House music."
3,The Good...and the Bad,"I'm mixed in my opinion on this book. I loved the third short story (the name of which escapes me) where our heroes are cursed by the gods and vie with assassins. It's perhaps the best Fafhrd & Mouser story I've read.The novel included in this volume is awful. Leiber includes gratuitous sex to titillate the adolescent reader. Soft-core pornography. The story is curiously bland as well. The Mouser is trapped underground for a hundred pages, while Fafhrd tries to rescue him. Then Leiber causes Fafhrd to be abducted and pleasured by maidens in a flying airship. It's awful. Really nothing here for the discriminating reader. Leiber should have left the Twain alone."
5,This book is must have!,I was so amazed by this book that I bought it for both of my brothers and my father for Father's Day! It really taught me EVERYTHING I need to know about pairing wine with food!
5,Long Live Willie Gluckstern!,Quite possibly the best wine book I have ever read. Gluckstern levels the playing field with humor and a no punches pulled style. Read this book and you'll be armed to the teeth the next time you read of or talk to any so called 'wine expert'.
5,practical wine guide--no snobs allowed!,"tells you how to save money and drink better wine, and the practicalities of wine purchase and enjoyment!"
1,Wrong Photo - Wrong Manual - This is NOT SCSI to USB!,"Despite the product photo, This is NOT SCSI to USB!Simply a USB-A/B cable. Incorrect listings on Provantage site as well. Looks like the error is simply being repeated here."
1,APC 19061CL-16F- 1E 16-Feet 2.0 Clear USB-A/B Device Cable,"Dear Friends, Received the product and found that it was no use to me. Wanted a cable to connect my old Scanner to my new HP computer, but upon receipt found that it did not do the job. My old computer and scanner used the SCSI port and cables and the new computer just accepts the USB port. What mislead me was the picture posted in your ad - it shows a SCSI size port and the product received had a much smaller port. I realize now that there is no such thing as a connector using SCSI from the old scanner to USB connection to my new computer. The product received has a connection that is much smaller than that shown in the ad's picture.Not your fault as I was told by several sources that there is no such thing as a cable that connects SCSI to USB.Should have known better but solved the problem by buying the excellent Canon CanoScan5600F.Regards, Don Tindell"
1,Never received,"I ordered this item and despite getting a confirmation email I never received the product. When I contacted the vendor at the 800 listed and after being transferred several times I spoke with someone who said they never sold items on Amazon and was absolutely of no help.Amazon helped to handle my dispute, but I would not buy from this vendor again."
1,waste of a book- hoodwinked/missguided and upset,"i cant believe this writer would call this a second book to the first one. this was a waste of a good read i could have read something else i feel like i wasted my time as well as my money. she never pick up the story line until the last 3 pages of the book. i felt like i was reading the first book "" if loving you is wrong"" all over again. alisha yvonne the writer should have not wrote this book if she didnt have anything new to write about. i feel robbed and i am sure other readers are going to feel the same way. and for this i will not be reading anymore books that ""alisa yvonne"" should write in the future. and the publishing company should be ashamed that they published the same book twice just to get money from the readers. OUTRAGED!!!!!"
3,Worth $12 or below.,"I Don't Wanna Be Right was interesting enough for me to keep on reading. However, I was very frustrated with some of the characters' dialogue or actions. I won't say any actions to avoid spoilers, but I will say that the character Roman overused the word ""boo."" It got to the point where I grabbed a maker and scratched out each time I saw the word boo; it drove me nuts. The story was interesting for the first half, then somewhere along the line it just tried to use implausible twists in an attempt to entertain or shock the reader. I was a fan of the first book and unfortunately I lost it, but I remember looking forward to this sequel. If there was an editor for this book, he or she really failed at their job."
2,I dont wanna be right,I just didnt get into the story line well. I wasnt bad but wouldnt pass it an froend....
1,NOT SATISFIED,After reading the first book I was very excited about reading this one. Reading this book was like reading the first book. The new stuff did not happen until the end of the book. It was only about five pages of action that you did not get in the first book.I WAS TOTALLY UNSATISFIED.
5,Great Story,I loved the book because first of all I love drama and secondly the book did an excellent job at capturing the emotions of the characters. I think that Alisha Yvonne is a great writer and I believe that this book is worth reading and buying.
1,Don't waste your money...,"I received this book for free and even THAT was a waste of money (printing and marketing costs). I would be highly surprised that anyone would call this a good read. It was horrible. It was more like the author put this together with a write by numbers quick and easy tool for writing novels.In addition, I would even go as far as saying, the reason the RAWSISTAZ Memphis Chapter Book club gave the book such high ratings is because...according to the bio of the author in this book...she (the author) is the President of that chapter. How bias is that? Perhaps if this review came from Tee Royal the founder of RAWSISTAZ, or someone from her group, I would be more apt to believe it was worth five (5) stars.I am sure I'll get some non-helpful votes, but the review is unbaised. The book is not a good read. :-)"
4,Very nice external hard drive.,"This is a very reliable hard drive. It networks easy and runs very quietly. Set up is also very easy. The only downsides are that it tends to perform slower than I expected and setting up a print server is not easy. Overall, a very quality piece of hardware."
4,Noise fan,"Used it for 3 years without a problem, now its making fan is making more noise. replaced it with a non fan version."
1,Their support really sucks.,"If the support phone line is busy, you don't even get put on hold. You get a message to call back and it drops the call. The email support can take weeks. You get one little hint at a time. I will NEVER buy their product again. NEVER!"
5,"I'm looking for clothes or toys depicting ""Molly""","My Daughter Loves this movie! She watches it all of the time. We just wanted to buy her clothes or a doll depicting Molly. Any Suggestions? It's her favorite ""star"". Thanking you in Advance, Linda Purdy Cricketill@aol.com"
1,cheap,For the money I thought this would be made of metal. It is nothing more than pressed MDF wood. Could have made one myself for less than a dollar. Don't waste your money!!!
2,Not too bad but only lasted about 2 years,It was okay for two years then it started skipping all the time. Not a great buy.
2,"Worked for just over 1 year, then wouldn't play","I see most of the reviews look good, so I think I just ended up with the faulty one. Had the machine for just over a year and then 2 days ago it stopped playing DVDs. I thought it was a bad NetFlix DVD, but tried numerous and still get the same error, ""CANNOT LOAD"""
1,PIECE OF JUNK FROM SONY!!!!,"DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS MACHINE....LOADING LOADING LOADING IS ALL IT SAYS AFTER ONE YEAR OF LIGHT USE.....ALSO ANOTHER 5 DISC CD/DVD PLAYER DOES THE SAME FROM SONY....YES SONY THE ONE AND ONLY ""NOT TOO BUY"""
2,Not as good as at it appears,"This is just a basic DVD player, not for ones who are little tech savvy and create their own DVDs and watch various media files like MPEG 1/2/4, VCD .dat , .avi files etc.I bought this to replace my 3 year old Philips 724 DVD Player.- It does not play most of my DVD+R disc- Does not play any MPEG1/2/4 files- Its sleek but little noisy- Display is sloppyThe thing is that Sony products are designed to play standard stuff and Sony proprietary technology, like a memory stick for a Sony Digital camera. In this case it playes only a standard DVD or VCD disc. So if you are into making your own personal DVD discs from your MPEG media files, VHS tapes etc then this is not the DVD player you want.Later I bought Philips DVP642 DivX-Certified Progressive-Scan DVD Player and ... woh ... it played all my DVD+R and media files like DivX, MPEG 1/2/4, VCD .dat, .avi files etc on my customized DVD+Rs."
4,Worth the money,"For about a fifth of what we paid for our old dvd player, this machine works great. We haven't tried using homemade discs yet and we probably never will. But it works great to play our dvd collection, even the older discs that our previous player had trouble with. It lost a star for not having a full set of control buttons on the front of the machine (it has some, not all). I have a little kid and losing the remote is inevitable, and I would like to be able to use all the functions without it. Otherwise, I am a very satisfied consumer. I plan to buy a second one for the bedroom."
5,Plays back self recorded dvd's others cannot,I record my own dvd's and and tried 2 samples of the Pioneer 588a-s a highly rated player with many features and tried the Panasonic S97S. Both Pioneer players I got from Amazon and the Panasonic mistracked skipped and froze on a number of self recorded dvd-r's on high quality media. This Sony played the same discs back flawlessly without a problem. The CD playback on this unit as well as the mp3 playback is fine with no problems so far.
1,Only lasted 6 months,"I bought the NS50 in June 2005 and it was a terrific player - for 6 months. On December 26th it refused to read any disc I put in. Discs it had played in the past, brand new ones out of the box, all the same message - 'Can't read disc'. No one else was near the player; it just decided to die on its own. I tried everything Sony recommended on their web sight except one; taking it in for service. It's cheaper to buy a new DVD player than to pay for a repair. I've heard of planned obsolescence, but this is ridiculous.I've owned many Sony products over the years and been very satisfied. This shakes my confidence in their brand. I've replaced it with a Panasonic and will see how that goes."
4,A little noisy,"This is your basic Sony DVD player. Long on features, questionable on durability. It will play just about any kind of commercial or home-burned CD or DVD, but it's noisy enough to be disturbing when I'm listening to a quiet movie unless I put it in a closed cabinet. As for durability, my last Sony DVD player conked out in less than a year (all the DVDs started skipping); we'll see if this one is any better.One feature my old Sony DVD player had that this one lacks is the ability to see where on the DVD the laser/head is currently reading. This was very helpful in tracking down scratches on the DVD and I miss it."
3,It seems okay so far,"For the price, I am reasonably satisfied. I find the remote control a little bit incomprehensible. I can play movies, but I have no idea how to do anything fancier than that. It has failed to play one of the approximately 15 or 20 movies we've tried in it, and it didn't say why it couldn't play it. My other player couldn't play that one either. It is very slow to start up when you put a movie in. It takes about 15 seconds or more, but it remembers where you stopped and will start up again in the same spot, even if you take the movie out and play another in the meanwhile."
2,Disappointing,"Throughout the years, Sony has alway been a reliable company for electronics. However, over the past month we have bought 2 of these dvds players, one replacing the other, and the second again failing. The first dvd player's sound started at an extremely quiet level. Sitting right up next to the tv was the only way i could faintly hear the audio. Knowing that this was not normal, we replaced the dvd player with the same kind, and were completely satisfied, until now. After only one and a half movies, the sound slipped to barely hearable again. Now we are going to get a dvd player from a different company, which is disappointing since the first dvd player we own was from Sony, and its lasted us 8 years. It is a good dvd player, and by the looks of other reviews, they have not had this problem. However, I am merely placing out a warning that this player has faulted in the past. If you choose to buy it, good luck"
1,You'll get two years out of it if you're lucky,"I thought it was just me! I am amazed to see all of the other people who have experienced their Sony DVD player just STOP WORKING after six to 24 months! This is the second one that I've had do this! What the heck is going on? Why isn't there a class action filed on this? Oh, wait a minute, there are...several...just google ""Consumer Class Actions: Sony DVD"" to read for yourself. It is not just this model either. AND it is not just their DVD players either! Sony is not producing quality product anymore."
3,Only One Problem,"Just purchased this about three wweks ago. Plays rental DVD's fine but the DVD-R's that I record on my Zenith DVD recorder does not play on it. The player indicates ""cannot play this disc."" I know my DVD-R's are properly finalized since they do work on my other DVD players. I contacted Sony but they have been no help. Will probably exchange it for another (same model) and see what happens. Has anyone experienced my problem?"
5,Damn good player,"Has all the playback features (except MPEG-4) that one could desire. Good remote. However, the control buttons on the unit itself could be a little more user friendly."
3,It's broke!,"I bought this player in July 2005 and it produced exactly the excellent picture I expected. However, 13 months later it is frozen on ""welcome"" and would cost well over the $75. I paid for it to fix. I'll buy a bit more machine next time and hope the quality is better."
4,Wonderful dvd palyer,"I have tried almost all the brands in dvd players so far this one is the best, it play just abut everything it looks simple yet it proformance is great,i have no complaints yet, i thought that the audio features would have been a little better other than that it's a excellent dvd player, touble free and realiable or the reason why i tyried this dvd is because i sometimes used my PS2 when myold dvd players gave trouble then i said if my PS2 work so good why not try a sony dvd and i have been happy since laterz folks."
4,NICE PLAYER,"The Sony DVP-Ns50P is an excellent machine for the money. It has an excellent picture and the coloration is real. It also plays a good viraty of disk and disk types. The only thing that really gets to me is that when you put a dvd into the machine you see come across your TV screen a nice blue background and a big warning that ""Disk is loading"". I really don't think that this is necessary. Who knows maybe some people need to know. But other than that I would highly recommend this machine."
4,satisfied,"It works for us well. Minor issues are: the front panel buttons are not very sophisticated; and there are no subtitles in fast (1.4x) play mode. It's relatively fast with recognizing discs. However a minus is that with MP3 discs it reads the whole structure of the disc before letting you play it, which can take a long time with an MP3 DVD. Also it flattens out the the directory hierarchy, hiding top-level directory names. Otherwise a pretty nice player, we like it."
4,Great Starter Multiplication Table,"This is a great table. Some of the others had bad fonts. I wish it was a bit bigger but this is ok to start. Also, I wish it went to multiples of 20 but this is a good start."
3,Who you gonna call?,"A reproduction of The Real Ghosbusters promo poster, if you happen to own an original your sitting on a mini gold mine. This one however is smaller than the original size. I didn't know this was a reproduction when I was purchasing it, but had a sneaking suspicion. My feelings towards it is, although I appreciate owning it and am glad I have it hanging on my wall, original or not, Since it was a repro I feel that someone should have gone in Photoshop and removed the annoying adverts that clutter and detract from the art."
2,ok,The poster was alot smaller than I thought but perhaps I should have maybe looked at the dimensions instead of assuming. My son still enjoys it so thats all that matters.
1,It Broke After a Couple Weeks,"At first I thought these were great. It's easy to slip on and off, the light was easy to see from up to a hundred feet away, but I let her keep the collar during the day and the front section fell off.The only thing holding the front section (which contains the batteries and the light bulb) is two small, cheap plastic pegs.This was NOT designed well."
3,Bright Light But....,"The light is bright enough to be seen at night. My one problem is the compartment holding the batteries. I needed to put black electrical tape on the back to keep it attached to the light. Despite this design flaw, the PupLite is the best one I have found so far."
3,PupLight Review,"The light works and it fits the mid-to-large size dog. It doesn't really light the path up in front of you that much, but people definitely know where you are, which is nice for safety purposes. I still need a flashlight to ""pickup"" after my dog at night, cuz she's not gonna point the light at it for me :)"
2,Spot-light. Bulky.,"I have a 90lb 5yo black lab, Rufus. This light hangs off the collar is large and is relatively heavy. Rufus chases the tennis ball at great speeds, jumping and clowning around. This is not streamlined or designed to be part of the collar. It had a large thick hard plastic belt buckle and then the thick light hangs on a hinge and will bounce against their chest or jaw if they are nutty like Rufus.Also, this light doesn't glow, it is like a spot light or a car headlight that is really focused. It shines directly in front of Rufus.. When he comes up to me and I look at him I am blinded. It's like looking into the sun.I would recommend this light to large dogs who walk with their people and are more docile. I much prefer the lights that glow as opposed to the beam light. The glowing lights are more effective for me to see Rufus when he's far from me at night. I would not buy this again.It does have sturdy construction and is easy to turn on and off."
2,Poor sizing,"The plastic component that the collar is to be threaded through is too narrow.If you have a ""click"" collar you cannot scrunch the collar up to squeeze it into the slots.I have six various buckle collars which could be threaded through the plastic carrier piece - and not one of them fits. It is too narrow. I will be returning the two that I ordered."
5,Puplights,We have a Siberian Husky & a German Shepherd mix. These puplights fit snugly around their necks (on the elastic band) so they don't flop around. They tend to move slightly (my dogs are high energy) but are still effective. The design is thoughtful too as the light itself lies flat against their necks. The light output is decent. Nicely made for the $$$.
5,pup light,Great product for dogs. We use it to help our elderly dog who is losing his vision. I sent them to friends who camp with their dogs and need to see them as they roam the grounds. I also sent them to friends who have a very large property and can't see their dogs without the pup light on.
5,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST AND GLAD TO HAVE IT!!!,"I love the Puplight and so do my girls (2 labs). I just quickly slip it over their head before I let them outdoors at night. Our labs (one is a choc. the other black) are hard to see at night. These are just wonderful. In the summer we enjoy sitting out on our deck (live on a lake) and feel comfort knowing where our girls are in the yard. The love them too, as they can see very well with the bright light that flairs out as the light travels. I highly recommend them!!!"
1,Not so good,"They say this is for dogs 8lbs and up, my dog is 25lbs and this is way to heavy for his neck t carry."
2,Mine blew up.. literally..,"when it worked, it was great.. maybe it was the battery that caused the problem.. after 3 weeks, it blew up.. it was all burned on the inside.. did not work.. would not buy this again.. very cheaply made.."
2,"Overpriced, not really useful","Not really useful, it lights up your dog so you know where s/he is, but it's not powerful enough to light up more than a foot (or less) in front of you. Not sure about all those reviews that it helps them see at night. Most (if not all) still have to carry a flash light. If your goal is to make people notice you (so cars are not zooming by you because they didn't know you are there), it's cheaper to buy one of those bicycle safety flashing strobe lights for about $7 from WalMart, probably a more effective and safer solution. Almost useless for the purposes of illuminating your path, overpriced if you are using it to get noticed at night."
2,Works good till it comes apart,"Loved it at first. Very bright, good size, AAA batteries. The switch was a little hard to work, but not that big of a deal. But it has a fatal flaw in design. Only the battery cover, which snaps onto the light, is attached to the collar. So if you leave it attached to the collar when not in use, you soon find that only the battery cover is still attached to the dog and the light itself is laying somewhere. Hope you can find it."
3,Overall Pretty Good,I love this light for my dogs ! It helps me keep an eye on them at night while walking and alerts others where we are.It's very bright and does not get in their eyes.Clip to hold light on collar broke pretty quickly though - disappointed as there is no other way to secure it on the collar
4,Must have for Med to LG Dogs,"Must have if you take out dogs at night and have a hard time seeing where in the yard they run to (I live on 40 acres) It is like a spot light! I can be more than 500 feet away and still see where my (dark colored) dog is. It will work best for Med to LG dogs becasue it is bulky. If you have a smaller dog (I have 4 small ones under 15 pounds) the best thing to get is the ball light style dog lights that attach to their collars.Some reviews said that this pup light did not go on the collar, well I will say you do have to have a thinner collar to put this on the collar. but width wise it will fit most collars."
1,Not what I expected,"This product did not meet my expectations as my dog's fur covered most of the light and made it ineffective. When I tried to return this item with the seller (Antonline), they denied my request stating that since I already opened up the package - thus causing damage to the packaging, they would not be able to authorize a return nor re-sell this item. If you try to make a return, you are required to answer a very detailed questionnaire and certify that you are telling the truth. I would not recommend this light if you have a very large dog with lots of fur around their neck nor would I ever recommend this seller to anyone!"
5,Puplight,The Puplight is everything that I had been looking for in a outdoor collar light. My smaller IWS was able to eat his strobe ball but he couldn't destroy the Puplight due to the fact that it fits flat around his neck. We can follow his every movement around the backyard at night. Hopefully he looks spooky enough to any of the wildlife in our neighborhood.
4,"Good, but not that robust","The lights are great and do everything that they say they do,. I have two black dogs and they help a lot with visibility. However both of the lights I bought fell off the collars. The screw, that holds light to the collar, seems to be able to detach easily. I replaced both of them with a tighter fitting screw and they have been perfect since."
5,bright light,i bought this light for when i walk my two dogs in the morning. it works well to keep us safe ans helps me see well down our dark road. i don't use the elastic band that comes with it instead i just attach it to the front of the harness.
4,good for overview/general information,"This little book has a lot of necessary information and was useful to me while I prepared to study abroad in China. I wish it had a bit more phrases in the back, but found it was a great starting place if you want to know about China in an introductory or general way."
4,What's old is new,"This is a great place to start (or end up) for anyone interested in Brazilian music of the Northeastern state of Pernambuco. What we are talking about with this release is Forró music. And you'll find a lot of that on this CD, in it's raw and urgent, danceable accordion driven form. Cascabulho, however, is not simply a folk project. The members of Cascabulho identify themselves with the Recife youth culture movement Mangue Beat , whose late king Chico Science is still revered. Picking up where the tropicalistas a generation before them left off, Mangue Beat is a mix of modern and traditional with any source ripe for inclusion, incorporating the rich traditional musics of Brazil, in this case Forró, Coco, Maracatu, and Samba, with rock, funk, and Jazz."
4,great ideas,"Most of this is beyond the average gardener, but it is well done and fun to look at. Don't pay full price, but discounted, it's a nice addition to your gardening library. Fun to browse."
5,Work Great,Not sure why these didn't get very good reviews. I think they work fine. I noticed one person put 2 ounces of milk to a tbsp of cereal and the baby couldn't get it out. Well duh. I think that's a mixture best fed with a spoon. I think its funny that all the doctors tell you not to put cereal in a bottle yet they make nipples especially for it. My baby gets about a tsp of cereal in his night time bottle with about 5 ounces of breastmilk. They work great for that.
1,Fast Flow Works Better,"This product did not work at all. I had been using a fast flow nipple for my son's bottle with cereal mixed in it. The flow was still a little too fast, so I was thrilled when I discovered the Y-Cut Cereal nipple. We just tried it this morning, and my son's suction was not forceful enough to get anything to come out of the bottle. I, myself, even had a hard time getting anything to come out when I tried. I do not believe the cereal was clogging the hole. I believe the product just was not designed for little babies in mind."
4,"Great price, but not 100% satisfied","Found these online cheaper, but I found that even with the ""Y"" cut...the cereal still had some problems coming out. So I had to cut them a bit more."
3,worked well for a while,"These worked well for a while, but after a bit with the baby chewing on the nipple, the Y shaped hole got torn out until it would leak while it was being used. Also, be careful when using the small nipple brushes on these nipples, as they tended to pop through the Y-shaped hole, which would tear them out even further."
2,I don't get it...,"I bought these on Amazon thinking that they would offer a little faster flow than the medium flow and allow cereal to come throught the nipple for my 4.5 month old. They just seem to be sooooo slow! The nipple hole itself seems to be big enough, but no luck for us anyway! :("
2,Not for babies.,Fast flow work better for cereal. These need to be bitten. They are not free flow. Maybe just not for my 5 month old twins. Maybe for a one year old.
2,Did not work for me,I bought these nipples for the platex Drop Ins bottles and they didnt work for us. We have to put oatmeal in my daughters bottles to help with her acid reflux and the formula/oatmeal mix did not come out of these at all. This was my last attempt in finding nipples that work for the bottles I have with the oatmeal so I just ended up cutting a larger hole with tiny scissors which I could have done with theh fast flow nipples I already had!
2,Didn't work for thickened feeds,I bought this nipple for using with thickened milk but it didn't work. The nipples collasped easily and baby got really frustrated.
1,Didn't work at all for us,"These did not allow any flow with added cereal. I only added one teaspoon of rice cereal to 6 oz of formula, and my 6 month old could not get anything out of these nipples. I tried to cut the y a bit only to increase the flow too much. Try something else."
1,NOT PLEASED!,I bought these and my Son cannot even get plain milk out much less cereal in it! I am very disappointed with these. I bought a bunch of them and now it is wasted money.
3,Not for pigment inks,"I used this on an Epson C88+. The photo is definitely not glossy. I tried it in an HP and Canon using dye inks and it is much better, but still not as good as my Canon paper. I don't care if it lasts 50 years, it looks like it was printed on cheap paper and smudges easily."
2,Shoes,"My son was happy, just got them today. The wheels on one of them dont stay up. I am upset because they are NOT skid-free! It would have been nice to know that..thank u"
5,Chilling blend of horror and heartache,This was the first Carol O'Connell book I read and still one of my favorites. It's the only book that ever scared the hell out of me while making me cry for so many characters who were irreversibly devastated by their loss. Carol O'Connell has a wonderful way of creating characters who are rarely likable or sympathetic but who are almost always interesting.
4,"Visual Characters, Gruesome Murders, Art is Business","O'Connell has a sick mind. The murders are detailed and punch the senses. Feel the pain and insanity of a victim's surviving family. Try to catch a breath during a killer's detailed confession. And along the way be presented with an amusing, realities check on the business of art. Mallory, her fellow detectives and friends remain colorful and intriguing, while uniquely progressing from the first two novels in this series. I did not rate 5 stars only because the whereabouts of a few characters were left open-ended, and I personally prefer earlier clues and foreshadowing in detective novels."
2,Discarded and yellowed,"This book has discarded by, I asssume, a library. It is old and yellowed and not as described on your website."
5,Killing Critics,As usual Carol O'Connell has done another fine job with another Mallory mystery. The majority of these books catch the readers interest and makes it difficult to put it down until the end.
3,Always interesting to have strong women to read about,"First let me say that I do recomend this book as a good read, I liked the main people in the book but I was left needing to have more personality from everyone. Perhaps an on going series.I did not have much compassion for any of the victims i felt the characters very undeserving of much compassion."
4,Mallory Is Back As Tough New York Cop,"I really liked Ms. O'Connell's first book, MALLORY'S ORACLE, and was looking forward to reading this book. I was a little disappointed. The characters are well developed and interesting. I especially liked finding out more about Mallory's past. But I found the in's and out's of the New York art world a bit dull. It's just not a subject that interests me, but some people might enjoy it. As in her first book, it's Mallory herself that brings life to the story. Now I'm looking forward to the next Mallory story, STONE ANGEL"
2,super-girl in action,"OK, the style is fine and the descriptions of people and the setting make good reading. But why has the heroe - sorry heroine - be a super-human, caped-avenger kind of figure? She is beautiful, expensively dressed, ""in addition to her gifts in the computer mode she had a hyperawareness of her surroundings which he found inexplicable"", she gets rid of obtrusive people ""seemingly without touching them"" and so on. All the things the very average reader might fantasize about in his/her wet dreams. So , if you like super heroes (although with gloomy and dark sides) this book will be good to read for you, if not - keep your hands off, this character is too annoying."
5,Great CD...,"I love Two-Mix, and this CD is awesome, but it's a bit pricey if you buy it here, I got mine for under 25$."
2,Lifting and Firming Eye Cream smells,"Boots No7 Lifting and Firming Eye Cream - 0.5 oz.I bought this on my mother's recommendation and also because I have used other Boots No7 products. I put some of the cream on my finger and as I was moving my finger to place the cream on my eye, I smelled something awful. It smelled like spoiled milk or worse. I put it on and it felt fine, but I literally cannot stand the smell. I also noticed that it is made in Germany. I thoughts Boots No7 was all made in France. I looked at another product that I always buy and it is now made in the UK. France was a selling point for me. Since I can't stand the smell, I am going to look for something else."
1,Suprize,"This is not the movie, you think it is. It is about the 3 days after Jesues dies.. It is not the movie ""3 days"" the gals all want. :)"
5,Best and easiest guidebook/map to carry in London,"I had 3 books and a map with me in London recently, but this proved to be the one that was most useful, whether making plans in my hotel room, or travelling the streets and Underground. It had the best and most convenient maps of streets and the Underground, plus useful (and accurate) information about museums and tourist spots. We were able to visit several lesser known (but fascinating) sites because I had read about them in this Mapguide. I was even able to give directions to some Brits who were looking for a particular mansion.I carried it everywhere (it is thin & fits in a coat pocket) and used it constantly. It is so much more convenient and readable than large fold-out maps, yet has all the necessary street and site information."
5,"The London Map Guide, 5th Edition","This is a great guide book for those who would like to see London from the ""ground up""! So many points of interest, including monuments, landmarks and tube stations are all marked on the easy to read maps, that it makes it very hard to get lost in London if you have this book with you. Small enough to fit in the back pocket of your jeans, but big enough to read without my glasses- hey that's a winning combination for me! It's so much better than the map book I bought from a street vendor last time I was in London. When I return later this year, it's the first thing I'm going to pack!! You can't go wrong with London Map Guide."
5,The London Mapguide: The Essential Guide to Experience,It is very good to read and have information on London before one goes there. London has so many places to see and do. It is good to plan ahead so that you do not miss anything.
3,Good but missing something,This map guide was a decent one but it always left me disoriented because it never tied into a larger perspective. I could zero in on streets but never understood the relationship of one neighborhood to the next. I ended up reverting to my Lonely Planet map by the end of the trip.
2,Terrible because it is hard to read,"The maps in this ""mapguide"" are very hard to read. Map labels are in random colors, fonts, and sizes, and are often crowded next to each other so you can't tell where one label begins and the other ends. There is minimal information about any of the landmarks, museums, restaurants, and so on which are on the maps. If you want a map of London, get a real map from a publisher such as Streetwise, Rough Guides, or National Geographic. The maps in this book look like they were made by amateurs. If you want a guidebook, get a proper guidebook. I eventually went with Frommer's. Others have recommended Rick Steves."
1,"A London ""A to Z"" Map Is Much Better","""Essential Guide,"" I don't think so. I found this map book to be really unattractive and awkward to use.I ended up buying a London ""A to Z"" map book when I was in London. They sell them at almost any bookstore. The A to Z map guide was so much better and much more comprehensive. I even got a pocket A to Z. That was the most useful thing I purchased on my whole trip!"
5,I couldn't have gotten lost if I'd tried,"This is the best eight bucks I spent in preparation for my trip to London. These maps are thorough, clear, and up to date. You can tell the wide roads from the narrow roads, and the tiniest streets are included. When you travel off the map, the page on which your route continues is clearly marked. And while each page is just a tiny section of the city, the layout of the book keeps it all in context. Theaters, hotels, pubs, Underground stops, and other handy locales are even marked (by name!) on the maps.One of my traveling companions carried a guidebook around and kept referring to its inferior, confusing maps. If I had relied on that, I would probably have ended up in Finland, scratching my head and looking for the train. This book is worth buying just for the confidence you gain just by knowing where you're going, not to mention the arguments avoided and time saved."
1,Disappointing,"As a children's librarian, I am thoroughly disappointed that Mr. Torres or his editors did not care enough about adolescent readers to better research his subject. How hard is it to find out the birth date of a living person? How hard is it to get the correct spelling of a name 'THROUGHOUT' the book. Ruben Studdard is mentioned at least 3 times and his name is spelled Stoddard in some mentions and Studdard in others. It is Studdard, by the way.One of the things we try to teach students is the importance of accuracy in non-fiction. This is a poor example.Mr. Aiken is a really good role model for young people, overcoming adversity with a positive attitude. This biography is one I would like to recommend for students. It's too bad this book didn't do him justice."
1,Inaccurate,"This book is filled with inaccuracies. Just a small amount of research would have helped. Too many mispellings and wrong dates, and just in general a sloppy effort to make a quick buck.I personally will NOT recomend this book to anyone."
2,Overpriced and under-researched,"Although anything Aiken is usually a given 5-star item for me, this book is a 4-star disappointment. It contains errors, which is unforgivable, considering that there aren't even that many details for the author to have spent his time researching.It is just not worth the price. Could be Mr. Torres has taken advantage of Clay and his fans."
1,Surprised this book was published,"I am very disappointed in this book. There are many non-factual items and grammatical errors. If this book is meant for children, statements made about his biological father and his and his mother's ""escape"" really should've been left out."
4,Song List for LP,Andy Williams1. Unchained Melody2. Do You Mind3. It's All In The Game4. Are You Sincere5. Lonely Street6. Village of St. Bernadette7. Let It Be Me8. Beyond the Reef9. I Wish You Love10. Hawaiian Wedding Song
3,Wings of flight,"I purchased this set to complement the Annika doll my daughter recently received. She does enjoy playing with the princess/pony set however, the wings continuously detach. Granted, the price is not astronomical like many other toys on the market however, that point is moot for little girls who just want to play with their doll and not have to ask for assistance every five minutes to attach the wings. Overall, Barbie products are great; I am just a little disappointed in the quality of this particular item."
4,barbi the magico Pegaso.,to my daughter him taste much this pelicula which was also the acccesorios or jugetes.
2,.,"This is a rehash of the soundtrack, but is good for notice to finally be taken that Zac Efron did NOT sing in HSM. In a Disney interview he said that for that reason he was not part of the tour. He does sing in HSM2 (fairly well at that)."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this wig to be part of a costume for about an hour. I was indoors and not really moving that much. It didn't stay on my head more than 5 minutes. It fell off and started coming apart. The ""hairs"" started separating from the wig and falling to the floor. It looked pretty gross. It's a cheap option, and in this case, you get what you pay for (or don't!)."
1,Why so few reviews ?,Why are there so few reviews ? This product has one review and it is horrendous. I have to agree.
4,"very good, odd ball psychedelic pop songs","what a surprise. who in the usa ever heard of kevin ayers? think john cale, syd barrett, harry nilsson, the beatles and a little bit of soft machine and you got the idea. very good psychedelic pop circa 1970. 73 mins. long."
2,Highly Disappointing,"This is a highly disappointing encyclopedia on creativity. I had looked forward toward receiving it for a long time. In the end, it's nothing but a collection of articles written by academics, most of whom have no credibility or standing in the field. Why the editor did not consult with the leading practioners of creativity and creative thinking is beyond me. Don't waste your money, as I did. Read it in the library."
1,"Misinformed, innacurate, confusing","I was thoroughly disappointed. The book would have been a much, timely treatment of events occurring today. The Cold War is over but there is a new threat amongst us: can the Intell-Defense powers be just as active to crush this new enemy? It would have been an interesting book. The author is often found waffling due to lack of material and sometimes even relating historical items inaccurately."
3,A little outdated but charming,"Ok, this was a bargain because it is 2001 edition. But my husband & I are finding this quite helpful in planning our anniversary 'staycation'. Some novel ideas- yes, tailored to couples- some nice suggestions for ideas we were already considering. Mostly helps with 'painting a picture' with its charming descriptions of excursions that my husband can visualize a lot better than my flights of fancy! Also helpful as a teleephone # guide, since the info is a few years old. Hints @ future editions but I haven't looked to see if those are available."
3,wall plug broke after 3 uses,"Nice pressure washer -- perfect for home use. HOWEVER, it broke after the third use ... no abuse. It appears that the GCFI circuit on the end of the power cord has blown -- won't reset, etc. They have a special screw so you can't open it to look at the problem. I'm going to return it -- as their website is horrible, and it doesn't look like there's a good way to get this replaced/repaired without visiting a service center. Not a smart design...UPDATE: I ended up cutting off the electrical plug and splicing in a replacement plug which I purchased from home depot. I've had no more problems with it since then, and I've used it about ten times now. The plug seems to be the weakest link. It's continued to work after I repaired the plug and the pressure/functionality is fine, so I updated my star rating from 1 to 3 stars."
1,dont buy this!,My pressure washer broke after 5 uses. It is blowing water out from underneath and keeps turning off and on when I am not using the trigger. This is my 4th pressure washer from Karcher and I really wish someone can make one that works and does not break. Too many plastic peices.
1,JUNK-IT,"After two years of a fair amount of use, my oven stopped baking and broiling. The toaster still functions,(big deal). Afer reading other customer's reviews, it seems that this oven is of such poor quality that the Black and Decker company should hang their heads in shame. Never again."
1,Don't buy this,"I loved this thing when I first bought it, but I should have read the other reviews because the are 100% correct. It toast unevenly but I accepted that. What I don't accept is the oven function not working anymore so now it just works as a toaster. What a piece of junk."
2,Turn around and walk away. Do Not Purchase This,"We've had this for a couple of years now. Where do I begin. The handle gets hot, the numbers have worn off, the door slams down (needs better springs). On the plus size..you can heat a pizza and use this for other items instead of heating your regular oven. Black & Decker should be ashamed that they manufactured this. There are so many things that need to be improved upon."
3,BIG,"I bought this product in the hopes of a sleek looking toaster oven. This toaster oven is huge. for the most part i use it to toast bread and i would not recomend for that. the toaster takes forever. if you are looking for more of an oven, then this would prob be a decent choice. but make sure you have counter space. its extremely big."
2,Great until it stops working,"I used this for a few years for toasting and baking without complaint. Then, like the other reviewers of this product, it simply stopped baking all together. The toasting feature still works, but I rarely used it for that. It's now junk and will need to be replaced."
1,Waste of money.....,"This product should be taken off the market. It started smelling like burnt rubber then set off the GFI outlet . It made a loud hissing noise and sparks came from outlet.I bought it for the size, design and color. After 6 months it set off the GFI I was going to take it back and decided to plug it in to make sure it was broken. It was working so I kept it, now several months later I need to replace it."
1,Poor quality toaster oven,"I purchased this toaster oven for its size and ability to cook a pizza. Within a month, the markings on the control had disappeared (I cleaned it with a washcloth and dish soap -- I don't use chemical cleansers). Within a year, the baking feature stopped working. This week, it won't even work on toasting setting. It is very slow to heat up. This baby gets hot on the outside, too.I do not recommend this product. It is very poor quality and very disappointing. I will not be purchasing a Black & Decker toaster oven again."
1,This gets extremely HOT on the outside!!,"I love using toaster ovens and thought this would be a nice one. I cooked toast and the whole outside and even the handle was to hot to touch. When we cooked a pizza in it, it got even hotter to where my walls were very warm to the touch, and we gave it plenty of breathing room. We have little ones and feared them getting burned! Please don't buy this toaster/oven. This is the first review I've ever written. I had to say something to help others not purchase this product. By the way, the timer was very loud also."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this toater oven like all the other reviewers, for the pizza capacity. It takes forever to toast and now the broil/top brown feature stopped working. This was a replacement for the first one that didn't work from the day I bought it. It was replaced by the retailer...I should have taken a refund! Of course now that it is out of warranty, Black and Decker customer service offered NO help!!! I will not buy one of their products again if I can help it."
1,garbage,first one lasted about 5 months. got a new one since the warranty was for 1 year. second one crapped out after 8 months. The dials feel cheap and do not last. shopping for a different brand.
5,five stars,"This book has been reviewed to death, so I will keep it short. I just wanted to contribute my 5 stars to the average. This book really deserves it."
3,Love/Hate Relationship with this book,"This book is funny - funny in the sense that I vascillated between being engrossed in certain chapters and in others I felt myself wondering, ""Will it ever end?!"" The decriptions and tales of what goes on in restaurants were fabulous. However, if I read one more time that very few people could survive in the kitchen, I would have vomited. (He should try a day in the classroom with kids, where the pay is not quite the same). Also, the author tries so hard to be modest that he ends up sounding totally obnoxious at times...All in all, it's a skimmer."
2,Boring,"I thought I would like this from reading the sample, but found that Mr Bourdain went on and on about his and his coworkers' immature exploits in restaurant kitchens, involving drugs, alchohol, and a lot of bad behavior. I usually like memoirs because you understand what made someone grow and change. Not much of that here."
2,Starts out strong...ends with a whimper,"I am a big fan of Tony's No Reservations TV series and had noticed this book on several occasions while browsing the Kindle store. I finally decided to give it a whirl after reading some positive reviews. While the book does have its funny moments, they are far and few between. Tony spends most of the book telling you what an abject failure he was early on his life. After reading this book, its amazing to me that he was able to ever get himself together in order to hold down a job, let alone a emmy winning tv series! I ended up skimming through the second half of the book as it could barely hold my interest. Pass on this book if your a fan of Tony in his current form, on No Reservations."
5,Great Book,"This is a fantastic book for anyone who is interested in a career in the culinary arts, loves food, or just wants to have a good laugh at the compelling tales of Anthony Bourdain."
1,Big Ego; Small Accomplishments Spewed Out by a Foul Mouth,"As a former cook and restaurant worker, I thought it might be interesting to read about the experiences of someone who's still working in the field. I've moved on to journalism, government, and the law, but I look back fondly on the energy, friendships, and fun of restaurant work. Anthony Bourdain, however, gives a bad name to both writing and cooking. He is a boring story teller with a foul mouth. He is unrelentingly crude and hyperbolic. He's such a swaggering show-off that it feels as if you can't trust a word he says. Although I got all the way through the book, I felt as if I needed a shower after reading this guy's ego-driven ""confidences"". Do yourself a favor and don't even think about buying this book, written by a second-tier cook, a third-rate writer, and a fourth-rate mind."
4,This is a good book but has some negative sides,kitchen confidential was a great book about the life of anthony bourdain but most of it was not about the life of chefs. in my opinion it was funny but i think he put to many things that were negative about the culinary business. there are some references about him being addicted to drugs and doing them. and it also had some sexual refferences and sexual things that happened. yes there are some very funny parts in the book that are some funny ideas if you were ever to try them. anthony made a great book but he put to many negative things in it about his life in it that might reflect what people might think secondly about the culinary business.
1,Guess who's not coming to dinner ....,"I bought this book based on an interesting outline and a number of enthusiastic reviews, but it was a real struggle to finish. I kept waiting for something to happen, anything to happen,that was either interesting, amusing or instructive, but it never did. The book is little more than a meandering stream-of-consciousness rambling by a self-important, self-indulgent egocentric 70s flower child ...While these may be good atributes for a chef, ...they don't make for a good writer. For those interested in more factual books, try ""The Making of a Chef"" by Michael Ruhlmann."
1,forgot how wordy it is read restaurant man much better,"I remembered reading this a long time ago and thought it was great. That was before I owned restaurants. Today I read an adjective self involved mans version of the restaurant business he drops names and adjectives not to descibe the location,or time to imagine yourself with him on the journey. He drops them like a puffed up parrot to show his use of the english language and dillusion of being a poet with a great team of public relations people that were in the right place as people wanted to know what goes on the kitchen. I couldn't get through this book this time, it was time consuming painful and wordy. I picked it up 4 times skipping chapters hoping it would get better and I was left disgusted with the book, myself for buying it, and wasting my time. I enjoy Bourdain on the travel channel so much more he's photogenic, tall, handsome, quirky, and more real. He must have better editors on tv."
5,Kitchen Confidential,"This where it all started for Bourdain. Acerbic, witty and brutally honest. If you love his show ""No Reservations"", you'll love this book!"
4,Hillarious and Informative,"A very entertaining look at behind the scenes of the chef and restaurant world. I'm not sure if this guy is that good of a cook, but he definitely has writing talent. His brutal comedy and wit is not for the tame minded. The only criticism I would have is that the subject matter seems to jump around a bit. It's hard to know if the book is an autobiography or a realism lecture on the world of chefs and food preparation. Maybe he intended it that way. But it felt more like he added some chapters just so the book would be long enough for major publication. Even so, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it."
5,Goodbye New York! Hello East Orange!!,"I watch Bourdain's ""No Reservations"" television show on a regular basis. His narrations always interest me, they being sadistic, off-color, perverse, and need I add humorous. His love of classical music that originated at CBGB's in New York only added to my interest. But the real deal with this ""cook"" (read the book and you'll find the meaning of this word) is that he loves and appreciates food and those who prepare it. His book ""Kitchen Confidential"" is an informative, amusing, and provocative look at the food industry. As I read this classic novel, I could hear his voice speaking the words as if I were having a conversation with the chef. It is an absolutely must-read for the Bourdain fan and anyone else who has found Monty Python's true meaning of life! A great read from a great gastronomist (Is this a real word?)."
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"I thought this book would be about what-you-should-never-know-about-kitchens-and-wouldn't-ever-ask. It does have that--most of it in a single chapter. The rest of the book is really about how the author becomes a chef.It's a readable autobiography, but if what you wanted were the skeletons in the kitchen cupboard, this is not it."
2,I needed a shower after reading this book....,"Bourdain certainly knows his way with food, there is no question there. Additionally, he is very funny at times. However, as a human being he is not only filthy and foul, he takes great pride in it! With complete disregard for law, humanity, decency and anything but his own gratification he drags the reader through his world of crime, drugs, sex, more drugs, more crime, etc. Honestly, the person Bourdain reminds me of the most is Richard Kuklinksi, aka. The Ice Man (a Mafia serial killer). Strangely, I think Bourdain would approve of that analogy. Creepy."
4,Brassiere Les Halles,"If you have any thoughts about getting into the restaurant business, read this book. It will enlighten the reader on the many positives and negatives (mostly negatives) on what this business is really all about. I have some friends in the restaurant business and much of the book replicates their business and personal lives. Many messages here, one of which is being willing to totally commit your life to the business or don't even bother to try, because YOU WILL FAIL! I love to cookand I'm now convinced to do ALL my cooking at home.I wish the book had provided the address of Brassiere Les Halles, because I would like to dine there some day. I have searched all over the internet and cannot find a street address or e-mail address. Can anyone help me on this?"
3,Leads with his ego,"As a cooking school attendee, the ego wagging all over this book rang very true. Some of the best chefs are loud, profane and totally into food at all costs. Mr. Bourdain is one of them. There are some great tips scattered throughout the book. Some of the kitchen craziness he describes is laugh out loud funny. I was not amused at his description of Baltimore. In an interview in a Baltimore paper, Mr. Bourdain attributed his views of Charm City to loneliness and a lack of a drug connection. Poor baby."
2,Disappointing & rambling,"I enjoy Bourdain's show, No Reservations, and finally got around to reading this book, but was unfortunately very disappointed. While there are some good nuggets of information about the restaurant business in here, they are overshadowed by Bourdain's constant and irritating references to his excessive drug and alcohol use, which he seems to pride himself on in a child-like way. Also, while I can appreciate some of the tributes he pays to the important influences on his life, the description/stories of some of these people seems to ramble on and are just written in a way that we don't care about any of these ancillary characters. By halfway through the book, I was just waiting for it to be over. Stick to watching the show, and pass on the book. Not worth the time."
4,Being a stay at home mom I have little time to read anything,"other than cooking magazines. My husband and I are foodies, enjoy cooking and dining out frequently. I became ""hooked"" on Tony after watching A Cook's Tour. I really enjoyed this book. Although I now, would never become a chef (he scared me off). I have to read all of his other books. He is ""tres"" witty!"
4,I'm glad I'm not in the industry...,"I just finished this book and agree with everyone else; it's a good page-turning read. My husband used to work in a restaurant and everything he ever told me about the goings-on in the kitchen was confirmed with spot-on precision in the book.The author is pretty honest about himself too--full of ego, testosterone and a jerk to boot--and then makes humble admissions about his own shortcomings in his chosen profession. It would have been nice to find out whatever happened to his parents and brother and how they view his success; and how/where he met his wife, but maybe he's saving that for another book."
4,"A gifted writer, but needs more seasoning","Being a fan of his TV show on the Food TV Network, I hungered for more of Anthony Bourdain's crude wit and harsh tell-it-as-it-is personality. Kitchen Confidential starts out with pure Bourdain attitude and fed my hunger satisfactorily. However, the latter half of his tell-all tale of the restaurant biz fell apart with random stories which don't tie together well with the book overall. Despite the roughness and poor editing of the book, I found it to be an enjoyable read. Bourdain does a good job telling his self-aggrandizing life story, but leaves out his wife almost entirely! Given his character, career obsession, and drug use, I'd like to know more about the woman who stands behind him and puts up with his horse [dung]."
3,Quick read...enjoyable,I loved Tony Bourdain's show No Reservations so I figured I'd like this book. I was an easy read. It got on my nerves in some sections when he went on and on describing his odd ball friends in the industry. They all seem like a bunch of rich brats who become chefs and then drug addicts...whatever...didnt finish the last chaper...lost my attention towards the end.
5,Couldn't turn off the KIndle,"Is that the new ""I couldn't put it down?"" A great read from beginning to end. Makes food - and not just the people who prepare it - sexy and fun. If you've seen Bourdain on TV before, then you can hear his voice jumping off at you from the page. Totally recommend it."
3,"Not exactly ""No Reservations""","Good, not great. I spent a lot of time looking for translations. Probably reads better for an avid foodie. I also got lost, or just did not care to keep track of some of the other people in the stories."
3,love food?,from cooking tips to a perfect description of tokio's fish market! The difference between just being a cook and a food lover.
4,Enjoyed the book,"For someone who loves to cook, and to read chef's stories, this is great fun. The book helps explain the ego-driven, sarcastic but highly entertaining Bourdain."
5,An insider's look at the culinary arts,"Even if you don't like to cook, I think you'll enjoy this book. I laughed out loud sometimes reading about Bourdain's adventures while learning his craft. I don't know how good a chef he really is, but he is an excellent writer, taking the reader on a wild and often hilarious ride. He makes the kitchen staff at a typical restaurant sound like a bunch of gypsies, and maybe that's not far from the truth. And you'll roll on the floor when you read about the moment he decided to become a chef! His descriptions of some of the people he's worked with over his 25 year career are dead-on, such as Adam Real-Last-Name-Unknown, baker extraordinaire. Bourdain also presents some practical advice on the utensils and equipment you really need in your kitchen, and on what not to order the next time you dine out. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!"
2,"Good book, terrible kindle edition","First, the content of the book wasn't very coherent. Didn't seem to be organized in any particular way, but the stories were interesting at least. I did find it a bit weird that he used fake names for all his former bosses. Don't you think that they'll recognize themselves in the book?The bad part is that Kindle edition has a typo in literally every other sentence. Clearly the result of a poorly OCR'd book without proper proof-reading. Nearly every foreign word was garbled. This made reading a book about cooking (lots of French terms) really annoying. The publisher should be ashamed to put out such a shoddy product."
5,Really enjoyable read,"I really enjoyed this book from cover to cover. As I have never worked in a kitchen, much of it was interesting to read just as a peek into the kitchen. I found it humourous account of one man's rising through the kitchen ranks- it educated and entertained."
4,Much better than expected....,"I am a big fan of Anthony Bourdain and ""No Reservations."" A friend of mine recently got me hooked on this show. The same friend has also read all of his books and told me to start with this one. After seeing him on the show and things that he eats, I probably should not have been surprised by some of his explanations in the book. At times, the explanations border on gross (there are certain items that I will think twice about eating or locations that I will think twice before going there) but it was very informative at the same time. He explains the behind-the-scene aspect of the culinary world very well. After working in a restaurant, I thought I knew a lot about this world. I was wrong! There are so many things that go into being a chef, owning a restaurant, or simply working in one. I recommend this book and can't wait to start reading his other works."
5,Awesome,"Great Book! I hightly recommend! It was well written (easy-to-read, flowed well, great vocabulary, well balanced with humor and seriousness, painted a great picture of a 'life-in-the-life-of'). I especially enjoyed it having worked in the restaurant industry for a period of time, but anyone would enjoy it! Definitely shows the dark side a bit, but I believe it's a reality!"
4,Anthony Bourdain,"If anyone has read any anthony bourdain books, you know he is sarcastic but stays in context. This book just keeps you wanting to read more."
2,Plainly and simply put!,"A word of advice for potential readers..This is well and truly an 83 page book..Lots of input and insight, plus good down and dirty info about the places we pay to dine in...then it's just downhill and repetitious til the last overdone adjective. The points are made early...drugs, obscene language,etc. and any grownup reader will find himself yawning and wondering what happened to a great beginning...too bad..love the restaurant, tho.And, I wish that alot of the chef talk had been more clearly defined..I still don't know what a garde-manger is, nor in fact do I even begin to understand what the 'dupe' system is all about. Maybe next time around, Tony."
2,"macho, macho man","OK, I get it, Anthony. You smoke like a stack, drink like a fish, curse like a truckdriver, shoot and snort and screw and blah, blah, blah. You're tough. Really, really tough. Enough."
2,"Oh, You're Such a Bad Boy...","Anthony Bourdain is an ego-maniac who hails from a kitchen milieu that prides itself on ""covers"" - the number of orders that get sent out on any given night. That he's graduated to both covers and quality is to his favor, but he seems to be most concerned with shocking us with the mess and mayhem of production line cooks and cooking, and in being the bad boy of the culinary world. He rails against celebrity chefs, but has become what he dislikes. ""Kitchen Confidential,"" is a quick read, somewhat entertaining, moderately informative, occasionally affecting, and completely self-aggrandizing. If you really want to read about how ugly a kitchen can be, take a look at ""Down and Out in Paris and London."""
5,Bourdain Is My Hero,This is a great book. Highly recommend it. Watch his show too. The world would be a better place if there were more authentic individuals like Bourdain in our all too often homogeneous media.
5,The Real Deal,"Tony Bourdain presents his life and an overview of the underbelly of the cooking world in this honest, hilarious and sometimes brutal account. Excellent information for anyone interested in cooking, and a great read with funny anecdotes for anyone who has ever eaten in a restaurant."
3,Perfect for the toilet or the train,"This is a hyper-fast, enjoyable read. Though badly edited, it's written in a very compelling and jocular style. Plusses are the dining and pro cooking tips, while the big minus is Bourdain's windy expanded resume. For about 100 pages, he talks about all the places he worked in and why they failed -- not very interesting and rather annoying. Otherwise a fun, fluffy read. Enjoy."
4,Kitchen Confidential,Great insight into the restaurant world. The chapter on what not to order at a restaurant alone is worth the price of the book.To bad there isn't a glossary for those of us who don't speak fluent food and french.A lot of fun.
3,Delightfully Vulgar,I foumd this book interesting and delightfully vulgar and insightful to the life of a New York City Chef
4,My Goodness!,"My Goodness! A great behind the scenes look into the goings on of the restaurants we all love. I'm a TV fan of Anthony Bourdain and this takes it even further....how he started, how and what he learned.....and not just the art of cooking. He delivers with the ease, humor and confidence that we've come to love. A fun and interesting read..."
3,Sends mixed signals,I can't decide if this book wants to be an autobiography or a tell-all of the NYand P-town restaurant business. It can be very amusing and Mr. B is a creative writer who has makes his colorful cast of characters come to life. Parts of the book are vulgar so if you have a sensitivity to crude and boorish behavior you might want to find something else to read.
4,Interesting,"This book gave me a new respect for chefs and cooks alike. I found it interesting at the beginning, but a little boring toward the end. I did get some great tips on what type of knifes and pans to buy for my limited cooking skills."
4,Autobiography of a passion,"If you've seen 'A Cook's Tour' on the Food Network (which, ironically, Bourdain blasts from time to time in this work), you're familiar with the author's take-no-prisoners approach to food and life.It carries through the book.He's a man who knows his passions, is single-minded about them, and has a talent for explaining them and himself. It starts with a moment of revelation when young Tony has his first oyster and he's still going strong thirty years later in a Dionysian binge through Tokyo. This man isn't afraid to eat anything and he tells you why in this book.Rather than being a scandal/gross-out/behind the scenes expose, this is in fact the autobiography of a chef."
5,Pressure cooker,"Now I finally understand the drama of cooking! It isn't just about carefully-selected ingredients and thoughtful recipes -- it's about getting it done and out to the waiting public -- before they tear you limb from limb! And the food still has to be excellent, safe, appetizing and cost-effective. Bourdain made me see how passion makes it all happen."
4,naughty pleasure,"This book was just plain fun! Sure, Bourdain is a little mean at times, but for a peek behind the scenes, you couldn't ask for better. For all those who have a fantasy that being a professional chef might be interesting, worth a read! I read it in 2 nights and laughed out loud while reading."
2,"Brilliant book, embarrassing e-version","Let me stat by saying that Anthony Bourdain is, oddly, a huge inspiration to me. The life lessons to be learned from his relatable, hilarious, and delightfully verbose 'Kitchen Confidential' are countless and invaluable.That being said, the e-version is abysmal. Bourdain's signature style -- rife with split sentences and tangents (like so) -- is all but lost due to poorly copied sentences and sentence structure from the original print edition. Dashes are omitted, leaving the reader to have to go back and reinterpret the author's intended meaning. I love my Kindle, and I love this book, but it is terribly formatted."
5,"Excellent, Excellent Look at the Restaurant Industry","This was a great book and a real inside look at what goes on in restaurant kitchens. If you ever go out to eat you should read this book. Believe me, I promise it will give you a new perspective on the food you are eating. Not a bad perspective, but a more rounded one, with a better understanding of how that food got to you and who prepared it."
3,Excerpts not a fair picture of the book,"Are you interested in this book because you read an excerpt about sanitary practices in the kitchen (the ""no fish on Monday"" rule)? Don't bother reading the rest of the book, then--only one chapter deals with that area.For all of Bourdain's waxing lyrical about how he got turned on to fine food during a family trip to France, we hear remarkably little about what he himself cooks now, or what he likes eating.I much much much preferred Michael Ruhlman's insider view of the culinary world; ""The Making of a Chef"" and ""The Soul of a Chef"" did far more to impress me with all of the hard work that goes on in a professional kitchen, and with how people work their way up to chefdom. Ruhlman made me want to try the food of just about every chef he described; Bourdain's writing did nothing for my taste buds."
1,Ok,The book was OKI like the way you can borrow from the book store. It was an interesting read. Hope everyone will like the book.
5,fantastic,"I love Tony all around, from tv shows to his style so I naturally got his new book. No surprise at all, great read, very entertaining and ""Tony-esque"""
3,Interesting but too articulate,Kitchen Confidential: Too many words and statements I didn't understand the meaning of. I love Anthony on his tv program but he loses me with his words sometimes.
5,Funniest I've read in 15 years - A Loud Mouthed Classic !,"Read this book one summer by a pool in Key West and people around me thought I was crazy as I burst out laughing 7-8 times. The stories are crude, arrogant, racist, sexist and saturated with addictions from nicotine to the hard stuff. Overall, a great read if you can take the abuse and understand that it's meant to give a glimpse into the back alley deals and inner workings of the restaurant biz.If you even have a twinkle of an aspiration to open a restaurant some day, it's a must read on what to AVOID and who NOT to hire! Even better when read with rum flavored libations, under a few palm trees.... but that's just my opinion!"
5,Kitchen Confidential,I recommened anyone who it going or thinking about going to culinary school to read this book. Everything in this book is true and if your a chef you can identify with what he has to say. This book just scratches the surface on what goes on in the kitchen. I just couldn't put this book down!
4,Did I Need to Know?,"Now that Bourdain is featured on TV, this book will probably get a new life. A mind-blowing look at life in the restaurant kitchen - crazier than we could have ever imagined. Lots of really good insight. Anybody thinking of following the culinary profession must read it."
4,"Too short, but only because it is too good.","As a fan of Tony Bourdain's show ""No Reservations"", I expected to like this book. I was not disappointed. After the first day of reading I tried out his simple fish recipe to rave reviews and am now doomed to spend the next month of my free time trying everything else. His stories of kitchen comradery and the battle of the crew against the customers bring back fond memories of summers spent in kitchens around New York. Infinitely interesting and easily inspiring this is a great read for any foodie, weekend kitchen warrior, and former or future food service industry lemming."
2,Disdain for Bourdain,"Perhaps ""disdain"" a little strong, but it rhymes with Bourdain. After enough people suggested I read Kitchen Confidential because of my behind the scenes reporting (positive) in the restaurant industry, I broke down and bought the book. Was interesting in first 50 pages, but got tiresome and repetitive over the praising of drug heads in restaurant kitchens and slamming of ""clueless"" owners. Yawn. Struggled to finish. Too many good things to read than waste my time with this mea culpa."
3,cooking and carousing,Interesting but disappointing at the same time. Too many negative revalations about the restaurant business and those employed in the business of feeding us!I think that I enjoy the author's TV show more then his writing.
4,Disturbing truth about restaurant kitchens---and a great read.,"This is a classic ""kitchen revelation"" tale about the truth behind the scenes at your favorite upscale restaurant in NYC. Often shocking, frightening and hilarious, there is no cover-up here.I suspect that this scene is repeated all over in all level of restaurants---hopefully in a little milder version. The pressure,tension and frenetic pace of a kitchen staff to produce quality food for many diners is a challenge and best done when the staff choreographs their movements. Enjoy this read & hopefully you'll still want to go out for dinner after reading it!"
2,Fishy,"I was really looking forward to this book because I heard it would tell me everything I DIDN'T want to know about what was going on back in the kitchen of most restaurants. I was looking for the book to relate to ME and tell me about things I am interested in.Instead, I got a bunch of choppy stories that won't name names or places and seem to be hazy at best in their recollection. I'm not saying Tony is a bad writer; I think he's pretty darned good at writing. It's just that in order to protect the not-so-innocent, he has to blur our all the details.He seems to be fixated on fish, which I can't stand and most of the first part of the book only offers advice on what sort of fish you should stay away from in restaurants and when. I did like the chapter on Bigfoot, but everything else about the book was a bore."
1,Bad Taste,"Don't believe the hype--Anthony Bourdain isn't saying anything that George Orwell didn't already say (with a lot more flair) in Down and Out in Paris and London. Mostly, it's hard to love (or even care about) the ups and downs of a narcissistic hack like Bourdain, whose writing is clearly geared towards shock value rather than style or substance. Kitchen Confidential is a undercooked mish-mash of personal history, kitchen tell-all, and home-cooking tips. Don't give up your day job, Mr. Bourdain."
1,Diner Confidential,"This book is boring and even though the author provides some tips about ""what really happened behind the closed restaurant kitchen doors"", it is done in a very arrogant way. The book is more about Mr. Bourdain personal life than stories about the culinary world. As a profesional cook I find that the author is a very near minded person and does not aknowledge people with different taste than his. Being a professional cook is to know to satisfy anyone taste with good food without criticism. Waist of time and money."
3,Take-no-prisoners approach to the restaurant business,"For strong stomachs only. Bourdain is aggressive, famous, undoubtedly competent, and very smart and funny. He is also a little bit scary, for food to him - like sex, drugs, and cigarettes (mentioned throughout the book, often) is a consumable, at its best thrilling, but also devoid of real meaning. These forceful essays are meaty exposes of the restaurant business, and probably should not be read for ""inspiration"" or enlightenment, or even particularly creative ways to think about people or food. He's a hedonist, and free with his dislikes (vegetarians, for example), but - in contrast to other famous 'writing' chefs - Julia Child, James Beard, Alice Waters come to mind - he does not love people or the possibilities of food nearly as much as he loves excitement and power. I was disturbed by his mercenary approach to his business, and some of the scenes he described are downright sickening - and included purely to shock."
3,"Shallow, Glib, but entertaining","Well, after reading this, I will never order fish on Mondays. Actually, I picked up a few useful tips that I will be grateful for. I expecially appreciate the tips on avoiding food poisoning in restaurants, having experienced it once, I want to avoid it at all costs.On the other hand, the book is full of glib machismo posturing, at times relentlessly shallow. Since shallow has its place and it was entertaining, I rated it a respectable C."
3,Hyperbole and aggrandisement make for a fairly weak broth,"Anthony Bourdain clearly wishes that he was a rock and roll star--a little too much. He is self indulgent in his description of his training and apprenticeship in the kitchen. Most disappointing is that the bulk of the book stays rather distant from what the focus of a chef's life should be: the food. Does Bourdain even like food? Other than his reminiscence of sensuous experiences as a child and recounting a brief journey to Japan, the book is bereft of any embrace of the ingredients of his alleged craft. It is obvious that Bourdain is not really a quality chef. He is a yeoman, at best. His focus on food cost, profit, and the number of four tops he has turned demonstrates that Bourdain would be more comfortable in the kitchen of a local TGI Fridays than a top dining room."
3,A Little Disappointing,"I was somewhat disappointed in Kitchen Confidential, perhaps this was due more to the excessive hype than to Bourdain's writing style which did seem very snappy, very smooth and ""right on.""I was expecting something more on the order of Peter Mayle however, dense and rich. Kitchen Confidential, while very interesting, seemed a bit ""thin."" Instead of giving us details, Bourdain simply glosses over. Don't get me wrong, this is very interesting and entertaining glossing over and Kitchen Confidential is a lot of fun to read.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for light, escapist fare. Although I found Kitchen Confidential to be less than I expected, I did enjoy Bourdain's writing style so much that I bought his novel, Bone in the Throat. I'll read it when I feel like laughing and not thinking very deeply.As for Kitchen Confidential, I would recommend it only for those looking for something light and only for those who truly love food."
3,Uneven Style...Must Be The Drugs!,I found this book to be interesting summer reading. The best chapters dealt with the necessary tools of the trade and the hints on when to eat out and what to order. I found that I couldn't put the book down for the first half. The last three chapters were the worst and I had to force myself to finish. Very self-absorbing...more than I wanted to know about Anthony Bourdain as a person. The writing style was very uneven throughout the book...must be the after effects of all those years on drugs. Overall....just okay.
3,No more than interesting,"The cover blurbs seemed to me to tout this as some sort of ""expose"" of the restaurant industry. Instead, it's an autobiography. Entertaining, but no big deal. FWIW, I do agree with the author's opinion regarding truly useful knives in the kitchen."
4,Interesting Read,I love Anthony Bourdain and this book was a great insight into his beginnings in the world of food and before his fame on the Travel Channel.
3,Kitchen Confidential,Very entertaining book but loaded (6O plus+) with typos. Extremely distracting. I'm new to Kindle books and hope that the other books in the store aren't similarly spoiled.
4,Kitchen Confidential review,"I really enjoyed getting to know Bourdain a little more in this book. I love his travel shows and his take on different customs, food, people. I get a kick out of his no nonsense opinions and how he states them. I learned a few things about kitchen ware and have new appreciation for chefs, cooks and all the work it takes to run restaurants."
4,For everyone who's worked in a kitchen or dreamed of it.,"While I only may have worked for four years in a small town restaurant, I maintain it was the best job I ever had. Being obsessed with food today and remembering that love I had for that job, I was easily drawn to this book. It tells the story of a man, an everyman, that worked his way and isn't afraid to share the rungs of the ladder.Entertaining through and through this read not only gave me a smile and a chuckle, but taught me a few things too. Even if you were a dish washer for a summer in high school, buy this book. It brought back wonderful memories and was full of excitement. I genuinely enjoyed it a lot, as I am sure anyone else will that has the interest to read the reviews."
4,you either love or hate him,"Anthony Bourdain is someone you either love or hate. He says what is on his mind and does what he wants to do. Kitchen Confidential is his story of how he became the chef that he. This may not be the story of how every chef does it, but it does seem like a lot of the kitchens I've worked in or been around. Its a good read if you want to find out about the inner workings of a restaurant kitchen and how it all just happens."
3,Very Entertaining Read,"I enjoy Mr.Bourdains' TV show and thought it would be interesting to hear alittle about where he came from (the uncensored version, anyway) and I was very pleasantly surprised by his behind the scenes stories about the kitchens we never get to see.I came away with a new respect for the business of cooking and the people who serve my meals, I think you will too."
4,Easy read,The book was an interesting glimpse into the life of a chef. I enjoyed it but didn't love it. Some of the writing just didn't resonate with me.
5,Great book for the chef in your life,I purchased this book for my husband who is a professional chef for Christmas and he loved it. It certainly is a good read!
5,"Finally, a cooks' book","Like Bourdain, I've been cooking for more years than I care to admit. My wife gave me this as a gift, and I read it in a few days. Not an easy task when you work the hours that the culinary trade demands. I, fortunately, was never exposed to quite the degree of hedonism that Mr. Bourdain was, but I can certainly remember similar stories about the kitchens I've worked in. The language and attitude of line cooks is just how he spells out; it's not for the weak or timid. I laughed many times during reading this book, because his recollections were a lot like ones I endured. Being a chef/cook is not and never will be 'easy'. To the non-kitchen public, they'll never understand the hell or joy of the biz, they will find the book not to their liking. If you've been through it, read it - it's good therapy."
2,"Great book, but there are text problems","I'm enjoying the book, but the Kindle edition is filled with text errors (spacing, hyphens, OCR errors). Not only does this make it difficult to read, but dramatically lessens the pleasure of reading the story. This needs another quality check and some more proofreading."
4,"Great book, but kindle version is filled with errors","The book is great. There is a lot of useful advice, but it is mostly filled with entertaining stories of working in the restaurant business.Unfortunately, the kindle version is filled with errors. I don't mind one or two, but there are so many in this book that I find them distracting. This was the first kindle book I've purchased for my iPad, so I don't know if this is a common problem or not. I am, however, quite disappointed with the experience and am therefore far less likely to buy more kindle books for my iPad. I am leaving the review at four stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
4,Great Entertainment,"If only for the tips on what essential kitchen equipment the novice chef should outfit her kitchen with, this is a good book to read. There are many good pointers for those of us who love to cook and for those of us who love to dine out. Unfortunately, there is also alot of arrogance, self agrandization and an ego that can hardly be contained on the pages to contend with. This was a quick and entertaining read that showed alot of the behind the scenes action in the restaurant business, however, having been involved somewhat in this industry, there are many things written in this book that I take issue with. Add that with a blatant bad mouthing of other celebrity chefs,(particularly one who is dear to me and my city) this book left a faint bad taste in my mouth. However, even with all the ego, misrepresentations and over the top lanuguage this is one heck of a good read. If you love good food, this is a book for you."
3,Over the top,"This is a funny and revealing look at the restaurant business from a first-hand perspective. Readers who have spent a summer as a dishwasher or prep cook will surely recognize the world Bourdain describes. But while the anecdotes in the book are fun and it reads quickly, the author comes off as quite arrogant and a bit of a jerk at times, which takes some of the enjoyment out of things. If you order your steak well-done, enjoy chicken from time to time, or are a vegetarian, prepare to be insulted. And while the tough-as-nails image Bourdain paints of himself may be accurate, it's also kind of overbearing after a while. The coarse tone is a bit over the top, which, though probably his intent, gets stale toward the end. All in all, an entertaining behind-the-scenes tale, though it certainly doesn't make me long for my days as a prep cook."
5,Perfect,"I love this book!!! I worked in the restaurant business for 10 years. Now that I have a ""real job"", I find myself missing the crazy work hours of reataurant life. I miss the people, because really, restaurant people are like no other. You either belong in the business or you don't.This book is just perfect."
4,I'll never look at eating out the same again.,"Gives a great behind-the-scenes look at the world of professional cooking. Also includes a wonderful section on best practices for eating out (i.e., don't touch fish at brunch on Sunday). The author's style may be too much for the timid, but I found it enjoyably blunt, honest, and funny. Bourdain should be proud for achieving what he set out to do: Imbibe in the reader an appreciation for the dedication of the kitchen staff to deliver a quality product."
5,One hell of a ride.,"This has to be one of the most entertaining books I've read this year. If you're looking for a witty and amusing book about the restaurant industry, there is no one better out there to read than Tony Bourdain. If you're an Emeril junkie, a Food Channel addict, or are looking for the next food ""bible"", look elsewhere, he will not appeal to you. But, if you have a sense of humor and are not easily offended, pick up the book and be prepared to laugh out loud. Happy reading!!"
4,From Heroin to High Cuisine,"This review is from: Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (Paperback). If you are looking for a combination of Hells Kitchen meets Cops, you're in for a treat. Anthony Bourdain's fast paced memoir details the many rises and falls throughout his exciting career, from junkie to star chef, and everything in between. You'll meet some incredibly disturbed characters, including ex-con sous chefs, mobster restaurant owners, junkie cooks, and you'll learn what really goes on behind the kitchen doors of some of the most well known restaurants in New York City. The writing is super-charged with vivid imagery and a lot of humor. But beware, this book's language, drug and sexual situations make it a definite R rating. You don't have to be a Top Chef fan to enjoy this book. It's a great inside view of the business end of the restaurant world, and why you'll want to be very careful what you select from the buffet line. A definite two thumbs up!"
5,Never laughed so hard while reading a book,"In a world of being politically correct, Anthony Bourdain is anything but. I've never laughed so hard while reading a book. His recalling of countless escapades with his questionably legal kitchen employees shine a light on a world few of us have ever seen. After reading this, I have a hard time entering a restaurant without laughing, remembering parts of this hilarious and truthful book. Highly recommended!"
3,"Too long, too much irrelevant sordid details","While there were fascinating tales of the 'inside' of the restaurant business, the endless references to Bourdain's drinking, carousing, and drugging were overdone. The book would have read much better if it was about 1/3 shorter with the repeats of his escapades eliminated. Didn't add much to the kitchen stories.I found myself ready to quit reading about 2/3 of the way through, but slogged on just to see if it got any better. It didn't!"
5,A malty-good read,"Naturally, this book is great for anyone interested in the food service industry. Bourdain gives you the inside dish on the industry, and it's just as juicy and spicy as you could wish for.But more than that, Kitchen Confidential is a pleasure to read. Its prose is indulgently conversational and perfect amounts honest and confrontational, somehow toeing the line between humility and justifiable pomp.Reading Bourdain's work is like sitting down with him at the bar, quaffing something malty and refreshing, and listening as he takes you inside the gritty scenes of the industry, the loading docks and the blazing hot kitchens. Once you sit down, you won't want to leave."
2,A Vanity Book,"Some of the chapters actually provide what the book promises - a behind-the-scenes look at restaurant kitchens, but most of it is just the author desperately trying to convince his readers of what a rockstar he is. I read the chapters on the kitchens and skipped over all the other, even still I wouldn't really recommend it."
2,Primate Gene Pool Alive and Well,"For those who thought that the Normal Mailer types were on the wane, here's one who appears to have been crossed with Joan Rivers. Imagine a mix of catty commentary on all kinds of inane marginalia mixed with egotistical swagger and you'll be able to almost smell the sweat of your cell mate if you choose to read this thing.But if you are a cook wannabe who needs discipline, delivered by a drug-vetted Dimmesdale, the author will tell you which knife will make you cool and which one will make you a [dork], while he's reminding you that you're never going to be as good as him. This cat's follow up should have a picture on the front with him swinging from the chandelier of his haute cuisine big top from his prehensile tail. Julia Child would spin in her grave if she weren't still alive (proof that she probably hasn't read this yet)."
2,accurate but oversold,a good deal of my life was spent in kitchens very similar to those described by the author. i agree with his portrayals but feel the flow of this book is hampered by redundancy.
1,sex and drugs in the kitchen,"I thought I was going to read some ""kitchen secrets"" rather than ""secrets"" that occurred in the kitchen.If I wanted to read about how a drug addict became famous, there are a lot more autobiographies I'd rather read about. Bourdain's arrogant behaviour and kitchen antics didn't impress me. The message I got was in order to be a successful chef, you have to use obscene language, have loose morals and do drugs. I'm a chef instructor in a culinary arts school in Europe.....is this what I'm supposed to be like to inspire my students????"
1,Too distasteful for my tastes,"I WANTED to like this book. It was our book club selection... I was hosting the book club meeting...and I always read the monthly books. Somehow, this book put me in a bad mood, especially during the holidays, and its foul language and distasteful stories didn't fit with my family, holiday spirit. Instead, I stuck with ""Good in Bed"", ""Clara"", and ""Master of the Senate""."
2,"yes, and","I studied with Madelaine Kamman in Newton Centre, Ma. who had the only great restruant at that time, she and Enzo Danesi changed the way Boston wanted to eat when dining out, in the 70's, you could wait 3 months to get a reservation in her sparkling, clean,restruant. I marveled at her ability to give the customer very good food, no leftovers and most of it fresh that day. Pates',some desserts, normally carried to next day, like a cake or frozen sorbet. I was there over a period of three years and know how great a chef she was and is. Sally LaRhette"
2,Repetitive and without point..,"Anthony Bourdain is the (abeit less-witty less-varied) Howard Marks of the culinary world. And he knows how bad he is. And will tell you over and over again because you are expected to be entralled by 300+ pages of this.He is so happy to remind you of the amount of drugs he has taken and his love of kitchen chaos, and this work comes to serve little actual purpose outside of a self-indulgent recount of his numbing adventures. Honestly, this piece could have easily been condensed to a chapter on his misadventures and a chapter for the rest.There are very few tips, even fewer stories worth recounting and the work is framed around an incoherant chronology.I do give Bourdain complete credit for his writing, which is actually wonderfully varied, intelligent and impressive. This is possibly the only positive to this dullish piece."
2,Ego trip by an overaged little boy...,"This book is a pure ego trip by an overaged, over-the-hill, drug addict and has-been chef. The look behind the scenes in the kitchen is interesting but I find his advice fairly insulting to my intelligence. The book ""Heat"" is far better and is minus all the four letter words which I do not need. However, the book can be entertaining if read it for what it is. Mr. Bourdain has been shamed by all the better chefs who actually have some Michelin stars to their credit and who actually give better advice and techniques. Even Anthony Bourdain's good chef buddy, Eric Ripert, is a whole lot more entertaining."
3,Kitchen Confidential-Adventures of a very LARGE ego.,"This book was OK. When I first got it I was excited and wanted to learn everything there is to learn about a commercial kitchen and it's operation. Not so.It was more of an autobiography about jealous, the Drunken, drugged up, to ugly for his TV cooking show loser.There are a few other books out there that may be better, like The Making of a Chef (Ruhlman)."
1,NOT TO MY TASTE,"For someone in a career that caters to the public, Chef Bourdain certainly seems to dislike a lot of people. He ridicules many of his customers, his employers and his fellow chefs.I got tired of his macho-strutting; his swearing; his constant references to drugs and sex.Yes, I learned some things about what goes on behind the scenes in some of the NY restaurants, but it wasn't worth the price of the book."
2,"He's a chef, not a writer . . .","Kitchen Confidential reveals all of the ""hidden secrets"" of restaurant kitchens. However, Bourdain seems to make much better food than he does books. Each chapter of the book is structured in much the same way and is so full of inane witticisms and irony, that it quickly becomes tiresome. You find yourself skipping pages to try to find actual literary substance. Not recommended."
5,a must,"a book you must read before your next dining out. scary, funny and pervaded with a deep love for food."
3,Great start then . . . yawn!,I loved the beginning of this book. The blow by blow account of the authors crooked path to becoming a successful chef. Once there the book bogs down in the minutia of kitchen life.
4,Tasty Read,"Kitchen Confidential is a series of semi-chronological biographical essays(pre-Food Network) that begins as an exposé of the restaurant industry and end as an ode to the characters chef Anthony Bourdain met along the way to his dream job.Bourdain writes with the voice of a no-nonsense cowboy proud of his exploits - the constant references to drugs, criminal activity, and the bad language may be too much for some. Despite the moral ambivalence, we meet some truly interesting characters (including Bourdain himself) and may learn something about cooking/food generally and the restaurant industry from Kitchen Confidential. Despite the 300 pages, Bourdain's conversational style makes this book a fast read.Recommended for readers with strong stomachs looking for a rambunctious memoir of a chef and a few laughs."
4,Great book,A very truthful and witty account how how a chef came to be. It's very honest. I love his recommendations too.
4,Loved it,"Worked my way through college in a steak/seafood restaurant. Though I read the book ten years after it was released, it was about the real thing and brought back many memories, and nightmares. Great reading. Bourdain's style is real and to the point. Not for the squeamish, prude, or politically correct types."
4,Engaging and enjoyable,"Bourdain is such a genuinely compelling writer, his prose as richly composed as his food. Will now be gifting a copy to the cook in my life."
3,IT is okay,I know that this chef is rough around the edges. This book is no different. There is some questionable material that you should expect from this personality. The writing is very matter-of-fact and not scholarly. The book is more for someone who would prefer to pass some time reading.
4,Honest Read,The book is a fun easy read. I found myself laughing out loud to many honest confessions and lessons throughout the book. The book is well written and organized. A refreshing read that wasn't too serious. Very enjoyable.
3,Interesting,I found this book interesting. Just in the fact that I learned much about Anthony. I would recommend the read to anyone who like Anthony Bourdain. It did make me look at restaurants a lot differently.
2,Where's the beef?,"Here is a great way to save some time and money - read this sentence: Restaurant kitchen staff drink alot and use alot of drugs, they also use alot of vulgar language. There you have it! The whole book! Kind of Hunter Thompson meets Julia Child. Quite repetitious and superficial. A bit of a disappointment."
4,Not as shocking as expected,"I never thought that one person could work in so many different restaurants. I found this book to be very informative about the difficulty of running a restaurant. Yet, I found Tony's life and his habits as a cook to be more interesting. It seems like it has taken him years to finally figure out his goal in life; to be as good a chef as possible. An enjoyable read that gives some insight to the enclosed world of the kitchen. Sometimes it is better to just not look in the kithcen, but sometimes curiosity kills a cat or two. This cat will shy away from muscles and dirty bathrooms."
4,Fabulous et Fantastique,"It's hard to believe that Anthony Bourdain's entire working life to date has been crammed into 300 pages. It a fantastic book for anyone interested in the 'behind the scenes' look at restaurants. At the time when a CIA degree was no big deal, Anthony decided that he wanted to become a chef. With degree in hand, he began working. He took jobs as a dishwasher just to get in the kitchen. He briefly talks about when to eat at a restaurant and when not to. As well as what to look out for if you decide to eat out. There's even a section where he recommends specific kitchen knives and ingredients you need to have on hand. Most of the book though is dedicated to his life as a chef. You'll love it!"
5,Much Better Than I Expected,"I really didn't know what to expect since I had never read any of Anthony's books or articles before. I have watched No Reservations quite a bit, and like the show, but I figured the book would be similar. The book is fantastic. Much more detailed and funny and honest than I expected."
3,Sometimes tedious,Interesting look at subculture but it gets tiresome hearing about the early sins of the writer over and over again.
1,He should have stuck to cooking,"This book came to my attention as a review from Amazon, probably because I buy a lot of cook books.About 1/3 of the way through, and one typo to many I realised it needed an editor. 2/3 of the way through I realised it needed a writer too. Pages of patois curses and their meanings. Of what relevance is this to restaurants really? Dated anecdotes of trivial New York decadence. Ethnic stereotyping. Sexism. Some very odd anachronisms. A few good pages here and ther on food and cooking. Not enough to warrant the price or time spent reading it.Ersatz gonzo journalism is both obsolete and out of date. Shame Amazon! For a few dollars you lauded this woefully inadequate book and now I can't ever trust your reviews again.00000"
3,I'd highly recommend another book along this line.,"I'd recommend a book by author Matt Lehman called ""Clam Chowder: A Server's Field Manual"". This book is much more realistic, funny, clever and insightful. I couldn't put it down. I'm not sure if it's available on Amazon, but it is online at www.clamchowder.bizI haven't worked in the restaurant for years, but Clam Chowder brought back a flood of memories for me. I have read it twice since I first got it. My book has now been passed on to at least 7 other people. They all agree, Clam Chowder is the best restaurant book ever - told from a server's perspective."
2,Gonzo fun but marred by strange homophobic remarks,"Bourdain thinks he's a bad*ss because he did a lot of drugs and eventually succeeded as a chef. He's not. This Vassar-educated ""rebel"" comes off as a loudmouthed jerk a lot of the time--which makes for entertaining reading...except when he makes one of his numerous homophobic remarks. He claims to have no trouble with gays, even writes nicely about some gay owners he used to work for, but he also seems to have discomfort with ""sensitive"" types he has known and rips on a gay waiter who dared to sue him--making a disgusting remark about microbes related to what he assumes to be the waiter's personal practices.Doth the man protest too much?"
3,Good Grief.,"This book has given me a deeper appreciation of the wonders of good food. The smell, the look and the taste of well prepared food will be more enhanced after reading this Mr. Bourdain's descriptions. What the book has also given me is a determination NEVER to eat in any restaurant east of the Mississippi. (and west may be suspect,too) . I will certainly have a deeper appreciation of meals cooked at home."
3,Fizzles in the middle if you're not into cooking,"This book was just okay. I enjoyed his restaurant stories but could have done without the kitchen/cooking tips. If you are interested in cooking more than a casserole, then maybe you would enjoy it more than I did."
3,Kitchen confidential,Fun read...true words about the great but nontraditional and underground world of the restaurant business. Definitely looking forward to the next.
5,Bourdain book,"Loved Kitchen Confidential. Everything we love about Bourdain is in here. His deprecating expressions, hiscaustic take on things....pure fun."
4,"K.Confidential, insightful and personal.",Love watching no reservations with Anthony. Getting to know where he came from is the icing on the cake...read this book its a insightful and personal look into the life of a culinary lifer.
2,SSDD,"Anthony Bourdain is a talented chef. He's also a kitchen pig. If you can get passed the cigs, sex, and old food sent out as the 'special of the day', there is some merit. If you can't stand watching his 'No Resevations"" on TV this isn't a book you will enjoy. Really, not worth the $7 I paid for it."
2,Okay for about 10 minutes and then.....,"it gets old. I had such a hard time getting to the end, it just went on and on. I can't stand to not finish a book so I kept at it, but really who can talk about themselves that much? I felt so sorry for his wife by the end, since he admitted more than once that he does not listen to her...you know food on the brain and all."
2,"Save your money, wait for the paperback","The problem is that it seems to be touted as some kind of ""expose"" when in reality it's just an egotistic autobiography, with an annoying New York attitude to boot. There are entertaining moments, but not enough to justify the blurbs or the price."
2,The Kindle Version Is Unreadable,The book is very entertaining - or at least it has the potential to be. The Kindle version is so horrendously and unforgivably riddled with grammatical errors and absent punctuation that all the mojo of the narrative is hopelessly drained from the experience. If Kindle books are going to have a price tag higher than buying a used paperback someone should have the decency to at least have these things proofread. Atrocious.
5,Awesome Book!,I am not much of a reader but this book drew me in which is really saying something. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in food and/or its preparation!
3,Funny at times...,"The book is somewhat well written, it jumps around a lot and is hard to follow. What comes from the book is that Bourdain should be dead because of the excesses of youth, he thinks virtually all chef's are hacks except himself. He is very jealous of those that have surpassed his talents and have succeeded without having to Drop Acid, Snort Coke and a multitude of other sins. He gives some sound advice, but truthfully, most of it is sound and very little is advice. But, the book reads fast and I did laugh a number of times. So I would recommend it to someone who is not easily offended and wants a peak into the Kitchen of a Mad Man......"
1,Worse book I have EVER read.,"Lewd.full of foul language, gross behavior, takes interest out of going to any restaurant. Bourdain is self absorbed and crude."
2,"Inconsequential, Egomanical, Overrated, Boor!","After reading Bourdain's ""Memoir"" I can't even force myself to watch No Reservations anymore, and I used to enjoy the show. I always knew he was full of himself and that was half the fun of watching him on the telly. But reading this left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). The book is disjointed and you can only read so many hijinx before they all start sounding the same. Oh yeah, they are all pretty much the same.Face it Tony, you go around eating everyone elses food and enjoying different cultures at the expense of cable TV but you're a has-been, wantta-be in this day and age of true ""Top Chef Masters."" Maybe once he is asked to join those elite, he'd regain my respect. But I don't see that happening."
3,Read the first few chapters and skip the rest...you'll get the gist!,"Would've been less dull if it were about 100 pages shorter. A better editing job would've rendered his anecdotes far more cohesive and readable, instead of repetitive and boring after the initial few chapters, which were fast paced enough.Too much of the book is based on trying to shock its readers...a lot of fluff, not a whole lot of substance. Or perhaps I'm just not that easily impressed at the antics that his staff/peers get up to: having worked both in the restaurant/nightlife industry AND as a bond broker, nothing raises my eyebrows anymore..."
2,fun in the kitchen,lots of fun to read in his typical breezy manner.would recommend this book to any foodie or travel fan
3,Who's kitchen confidential?,"Ok..I liked the book. But, after being in the same business Mr. Boudrain is...I must say that what he paints as standard procedure in all restaurant kitchens is simply not the case. Like I said..I liked the book, but I find myself wondering if Mr. Bourdain spent his years training on a pirate ship.Peter Vazquez , Chef/Owner Marisol Restaurant (hello S.M.)"
4,Good read even if you never worked in a kitchen in NY.,"I have done time as a low level cook in my mid teen years. Stared with myopic abandon while high on grass as I tackled a huge pile of trays at the dishwashing sink - no mechanical washers in my days, it was long and hard work!Even if you never cooked a pack of Ramen in your life, this is a good read if you enjoy Bourdains' semi-Hunter Thompsonesque existance in the entertainment world.I can admire a man that gets kicked of Food Network for essentually crusing around and getting blotto on camera in far away places.....heck, that's what I'd do if I had the chance!Now I need to read A Cooks Tour which I percieve as being better than Confidential.Tony - Good Luck on your up and coming show with Travel Channel. Hope they have more patience for your antics than Food TV did. Hope 'they' let you be yourself. Anything else would be fraudulent! See ya on Egullet.com"
5,Great Read - Great Condition,"Prompt delivery, the book was in great condition. Fantastic read. Enjoyed it very much! Thank you."
5,Reads just like his show,"This book is really great, and as a fan who was first introduced to Anthony Bourdain through his show, I enjoyed how the book had the same tone as his speech. As I was reading, it almost seemed liked he was reading the book to me. For anyone who likes No Reservations, I highly recommend this book."
2,"Strangely compelling, yet ultimately not my cuppa tea","The subtitle, Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly, is very apt.Bourdain makes frequent use of simile and metaphor in his writing. Like a junior high boy, however, all his comparisons refer to human excretory functions and sex acts.The book was strangely compelling, yet ultimately not my cuppa tea."
5,Loved this book,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Tony's book. I just love his cynicism, by far my favorite chef. Can't wait to read his others."
5,Brutal Honesty,"This book can be quite funny at times, but also puts for some brutal honesty about the food industry. A great read for anybody thinking about working as a chef or in a kitchen."
3,"Easy, entertaining read","I enjoy Bourdain's shows, and was hoping to enjoy this a little more. It's got some entertaining stories, interesting cooking and restaurant tips, but nothing spectacular."
4,A fast pace tempo that many New Yorkers know and love.,"I bought this book for a six-hour flight and chuckled the whole way. Before reading the book becoming a chef was always a distant fantasy. Not anymore! Anthony Bourdain does not hold back in regards to revealing trade secrets, his opinions of select celebrity chefs, common obscenities used in the work place and his generalization of which nationalities work best together in a kitchen. He tells great stories about his experiences in various NYC restaurants such as Supper Club and Les Halles. It has the same fast pace tempo that many New Yorkers are familiar with. Being a native New Yorker I felt right at home reading this book and finished wanting more."
3,Never Be Able To Look At A Menu The Sam Way Again,"Until recently I had not read much non fiction or biographical work. I'm put off by the sheer self-indulgence of autobiography but read `Kitchen Confidential' after several friends had endlessly enthused about it. It's definitely an interesting story and Bourdain has without a doubt lead a fairly intense kind of life. If you are a regular restaurant goer you might be advised to give this a miss because you'll never be able to look at a menu again without some of Bourdain's gruesome details echoing through your skull, putting you off your food! Read this if you are entertaining the notion of opening your own restaurant or becoming a chef. There's some good advice in here regarding why you shouldn't be entertaining such a notion."
5,This book did nothing to deter me,"After many years slaving away in Middle Management in Corporate America, I've entered Culinary school, with the ultimate goal of becoming a chef. My father-in-law does not think that this is a wise course of action, so he sent me 'Kitchen Confidential' in an effort to deter me. Bourdain's accounts of the freaks and criminals with whom he works is magnificent. The people he describes have more character, soul, and honesty than any of the shiftless clowns in Corporate America.My father-in-law's plans have failed. I am SO looking forward to my career change!"
4,A page turner for the aspiring chef or foodie,"As a person who worked in the restaurant industry for about a dozen years before making my escape, I can attest to the accuracy of Anthony Bourdain's expose. If you are looking for a book that glorifies the exalted 3 star restuarants of the world and the ""celebrity chefs"" that run them, you would be wise to look elsewhere. If, however, you want a taste of what it's really like behind the scenes at a fine dining establishment, look no further. Mr. Bourdain's tales of making his way up the food chain to Executive Chef status and the characters encountered along the way make for an always entertaining read."
2,Mastering the Art of Self Absorption,"Bourdain's account of his life as a chef is too long by half. The best parts of the book--his amusing revelations about where restaurant leftovers end up and why NOT to order the special--appeared in The New Yorker. Save money by finding the back issue and reading him there.The rest of the book, Bourdain's autobiography, is an unsavory casserole of narcissism and some not terribly convincing self loathing, spiced with so many boring references to scoring drugs that, by the end, I found myself skimming rather than reading. There are a number of typos, and the book has a manic, disorganized quality that presumably reflects the author's personality but, more likely, suggests that it was rushed into print. Bourdain's prose resembles, well, a buffet table: a few decent things but an awful lot of chicken chow mein and seafood Newburg."
3,"Look At Me, I'm Cool!!!!","Unless you are a Bourdain fan, his constant preening and literary strutting will become tiresome really fast. However, despite the Bourdain taint, the book does offer an interesting glimpse into the life of a line cook and the assorted pecking order of a commercial kitchen. Worth a listen for the background/insight into New York's culinary underbelly."
4,"Good, but...","I would have given this 5 stars, as I'm really enjoying it. However, the Kindle version is absolutely riddled with typos! Tony would NOT be pleased...."
3,Not sure what I got,"Stand appears to be nice, but looks like I received a used one or at least one kicked around the warehouse for a few years--lots of scratches and scuff marks. One end was completely broken off causing some additional damage to the finish. I'm comfortable using wood glue and repaired it, but shouldn't have been necessary. Once the glue dries I'll decide whether to refinish it or not."
4,Well worth a thorough read.,"I found this book full of good examples (brave ones,too) which showed why the particular quality is so necessary to a good life. This teacher obviously respected and cared about his students. This material is shared from his heart. It's a fine legacy from a devoted teacher."
4,Life's Greaest Lessons,"The paperback books I received were in good shape and they were shipped sooner than Amazon stated they would be shipped, but the shipping price was outrageous! The total cost for 7 books were $15. The Shipping was $30.00!!! That's ridiulous!!"
4,Good Read When You Need a Lift,"This is my first Hal Urban book but it is refreshing and has some really good things to think about presented in a simple, honest and straight forward way. When you are needing a lift and or know someone who might need some 'direction' this is a good read. It is easy to read, chapters arent long and you can read one a night if you want ... worth the price of admission."
5,WOW!!! What an Eye Opener,"I can't believe the amount of direction this book can give in life. It has some very good lessons about living life to the fullest and making the most of who you are. I would recommend this book to everyone because I think at some point it is good for all of us to evaluate ourselves.I think that this book is especially good for teachers so that these lessons can be passed along to children/students. Too often children are not exposed to these lessons, which I believe would make them much more aware of what they want to do with their lives."
1,just another lawyer on an ego trip,"This is just another book by a lawyer who thinks he is some kind of hero. What a joke. The author obviously is having a tough time making a living handling cases for clients with bad transmissions, so he decided to write a book to try to make a few bucks. If this is his first book, it should also be his last. Boring, self-serving and meaningless."
4,Einstein Was On FBI Watch List,"If you're looking for a discussion of Einstein's scientific genius stop here. This film was made for The Biography Channel and as such concentrates on the scientist's - sometimes troubled - personal life. Consequently it can appear to be somewhat salacious, an abandoned first child, numerous affairs etc. However, the film is redeemed by the revelation that Einstein was targetted by Hoover's FBI as a communist and potential 'enemy of the state'. And of course all this was happening at the very time that Einstein was being celebrated as an immigrant who had fled Nazi tyranny to find freedom in the United States. The script is simplistic in places and takes numerous short cuts (the First World War is over in two minutes!) but if you are looking for an introduction to Einstein the man and the times in which he lived, this is a pretty good place to start."
1,Crack a Filling,The pepper mill is fine. The salt mill is a tragedy. My brother cracked his filling on it. I have had numerous other guests complain. I have even tried grinding all the salt out into a bowl and putting it back in - thinking the second grinding would help . No such luck. The salt is not ground fine enough to enjoy without worrying about your dental bill. Will not continue use of this product and do not recommend it.
1,"William Bounds ""Mary"" Salt and Pepper Mill Set. Poor.","The flow of the pepper mill is slow. I am a senior citizen and by time I have the right amount of pepper, my wrist is sore from grinding. I would like to return it for a faster flowing set. The problem is I was hospitalized and my time expired and the box and pappers were accidently destroyed."
3,"Too many words, not enough room to write","For a workbook, I feel this book was just to wordy. It is well organized, but I think it would have worked better as a book about forgiveness and then a workbook with the questions.Forgiveness is a Choice would be my choice if you are looking for a book to work through forgiving someone."
4,Helpful tool for ending resentments,This has been a good tool (I am a counselor) and i have used this book a few times to help with people who are holding onto resentments and need to forgive. I would highly recommend this book!
2,Same tired old stuff,"I've probably read most of the books written just by Norton plus quite a few of the collaborations. While I really liked her books when I was much younger they now seem so formulaic; this book is no exception. Beast master problems with telepathic links, the Xiks, cooperation in order to defeat the threat and new-found love between what seem like antogonists at the beginning of the tale. I am also annoyed at what seems like constant repackaging of her older works. I really think that this mine is just played out and that Miss Norton should hang it up."
5,Great Quality,Amazon has this under toys. This is not a toy. It's for display and it looks great. It's resin not plastic so it's very nice.
4,Short book with a lot of useful information...,"""The Big Red Fez: How To Make Any Web Site Better"" by Seth Godin is a book that can be read very quickly, yet it has a lot of useful information in it."
4,Must-read for any commercial web designer,"Seth Godin may ""get"" the Internet better than just about anyone else out there, and proves it in this brisk but pithy little volume. THE BIG RED FEZ really looks at two very important components of design in an e-commerce site; ease of use and marketing focus.These two concepts go hand-in-hand in ways that I blushingly admit I did not see before I read this book. Godin's insights into how sites work are smart, sensible, and entertaining.It's a quick read (I got through it in a couple of hours, at my computer, visiting many of the sites he uses in the book), but the concepts Godin presents are valuable and worth frequent revisiting.If you read only one web-design book this year, make it this one!(and a special PS to Seth: Thanks for pointing out the ""SADWEEK.COM"" parody site; best laughs I've had in months!)"
1,"If you need to read this book, then don't bother builing a website","This book was a waste of the 30 minutes it took me to read. Seriously if you need to read this book you should not be building a website. Let someone else do it for you. This book should be given to foreign programmers as they have no clue. If you surf the web everyday you will have all of the knowledge that this book provides. Nothing new here, he just puts together ideas he thinks work. I only found one page of the book helpful. I run an e-commerce company for tall men's clothing and my friend told me to read this book. A waste of time if you ask me if you haven't already figured it out."
2,Book or brochure?,"I find it difficult to believe so many people liked this book:The author starts off with 'bad' examples that admittedly have been made on many websites, but are really to obvious to put in a book of which the author is claimed to have 'inimitable wisdom' (back cover).Then, towards the end, more examples of 'good' design are given, and most of these did not impress me at all. At some point I even got the feeling this was some sort of brochure (given its size, you can hardly call it a book) written to advertise the websites of Godin's friends and clients.The enormous amount of research the author must have done is nicely summarized in this quote from page 105: 'Find the sites on the web that are working and copy their organization.'If you're looking for a good book on this subject, look up Steve Krug or Jakob Nielsen."
5,Guidelines for Creating a Useful and Profitable Website,"Short and sweet list of do's and don'ts for website designers. Most of the guidelines are common sense unless you're a techie or web designer, which is the whole point that the author is trying to make. You need to put on the marketing hat when it comes to profitable web design. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has a website or develops websites and desires to increase their customer retention and profits."
4,"Great info, simple formatt","I enjoyed the points made in this book. They are basic and you'll find yourself saying ""of course!"" However, sometimes we need to see it in print to realize or remember.I would have loved to read more commentary on each topic. Why leave a page 2/3 blank? If you can't at least fill a page with content, maybe it isn't important enough to put the topic in the book.Overall, buy it (maybe used) and study these principals. They make sense and work. 4 of 5 stars."
2,Better read Krug or Nielsen,"As someone suggested, you are better off reading Steve Krug or Jakob Nielsen. I like Seth Godin and many of his books, but this one was just not worth the money. Maybe I know too much, I don't know. I would save your money and by one of Seth's other books.This book has too many pictures and not enough substance or insight."
5,excellent book for research,This book helped me understand my forefathers who came to San Francisco in 1888 and in 1906. I shared the reading with my children.
1,This book makes me want to hop the border to Canada,This book is truly awful. I don't know what her publisher was thinking by letting this book get out. The tone: Nasal. The language: Sociological jargon. The argument: Garbage. Save a tree and find something better.
1,Oil Rubbed Finish -- Chipping off in less than a year's use,"I was looking forward to coordinating my Oil Rubbed Bronze Faucet and purchased this insinkerator flange. After less than 6 months, the color began to chip off. It is less than a year now, and I see the problem is getting steadily worse. This is not an easy part to switch out, as it is glued in. We do not use harsh cleaners or abrasives.This simply is a defective type of finish to put into a sink used with running water!Insinkerator should work with Moen to create a work-horse bronze finish for the flange , same as used on the faucets."
1,Do Not Purchase,"Do not waste your time with this flange. The paint on the flange that I purchased started to peel in just over 2 months. Insinkerator was willing to replace my oil rubbed flange with another oil rubbed one or a stainless steel one. They could not provide me with any confidence in getting another oil rubbed bronze flange, only stating that it was an accessory item & to wash it with soft soap. So, I opted to go back to the standard stainless steel and had to pay a 2nd time for installation."
1,Just like the others,Paint began chipping right away and now my wife wants me to replace it again!Poorly painted product that doesn't stand up to normal wear at all!
1,Beware of matte black finish!,I have a black Blanco silgranit sink so this product was what matched. As stated in the other reviews this flange started peeling within months of installation. When I called Insinkerator they told me if I use a different brand of flange then I will void the warranty on the disposal. I guess I will have no warranty because there is NO WAY I'm purchasing another one of these just to have it peel again. And under the coating it is bright gold so it's very obvious and ugly. Buyers beware.
3,"Product Good, But Shipping Was Slooooooow.","It took the seller 5 days from time order was placed to ship the product, then due to the slow shipping method used by seller took about another week to get here.Our old flange was chipped and looked terrible (after 15 years) so we ordered this to replace it. It's only been installed for a few days, but it looks great and the paint appears to be very durable (time will tell). Even though shipping was very slow, the product appears to be good quality and the price was good. Will update this review if in the future the paint chips."
5,FLANGE,I have purchased this type item in the past to cover the stainless opening. They were to flexible. Your product is superior the others. Highly recommend your product to others who need this flange.
4,Necessary if you have a black sink,This does the job if you have a black sink and want inconspicuous flange fitting. Gave 4 stars because I don't know how it will stand up against wear.
2,if you love the beach this is the book for you...,"This travel book was a bit disappointing, I bought this book because it was the most recently published book on travel in Sri Lanka. It is a great book if you plan to only go to the beach and Colombo. It has very little information on the interior of the country. For a more well rounded book I would get the lonely planet guide instead."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"I bought this item to upgrade my older version of Omniform. Upon receiving the item it would not install on my new Windows Vista Computer. I called customer service and after waiting 38 minutes and being told that I was allowed only 1 free technical service call and that all subsequent calls would cost me $20.00 per call, I was told that this product would not work with Windows Vista and that it would never work with Vista that I should return the product to whomever I purchased it from. So I did, but, I had to pay a 30% restocking fee! I used to love omniform. But I will find a better alternate program. Don't support software that won't support you!"
1,Not supported in Vista,Do not order this product if you run Vista. It will not work. Nuance should put that in large type in all the advertising so people don't purchase it and then find out it won't work!
2,Omniform- Be warned! it will crash,"The omniform forms are touted as forms that work as databases. NEVER use omnform form's built in database. Omniform forms have a ridiculously low file size limit of about 4.5MB and will crash without warning. Calculations such as subtracting time A from time B and displaying time lapsed will not work and return error messages. Not worth the price. However if the company bothers to read all the horrible crash stories,they might think of tying the form to an open source embedded database(which should work without any stupid limitations on file size etc) . The sad part is that whenever Nuance buys decent products they stop developing these products. This includes IBM ViaVoice, Scansoft Omniform. Omniform 5 is a great tool for testing user interfaces before designing database products."
1,It just sucks!!,"I was lucky and have a computer that still runs Windows XP-Pro so I didn't get caught in that trap,but from the very beginning it's been a pain. It might be OK if you are desperate to have just the basic functions. When I went to install It told that my security key was invalid. After several attempts it I tried to call technical support that wasn't available and never returned e-mails or phone calls. Absolutely worthless. I tried to return it to Staples where I bought it ( $100.00 ) and They wouldn't take it back because it was opened. ( they would replace it with the same title and version) From now on I will only buy trial versions and because you end up screwed. I also wish Ii had not impulsed bought and had checked reviews before I bought. limited functionality - and very poor support - I should have known with Scansoft - but I saw Nuance and thought I might be worth it. This software is worth $20.00 at the most.."
4,the only work on the subject,"An excellent little book, well produced, well written, well illustrated and most informative despite its small size. Numbering perhaps around 100, the Jarawa are one of the world's very few remaining truly palaeolithic people. Most refuse all contact with the outside world and have done so for centuries. Very little is known about them although quite a few relevant scholarly manuscripts are gathering dust unpublished. That the Anthropological Survey of India has backed the publication of this book is highly to be appreciated."
2,Overview and that's all,"Well despite an appealing title, it remains an overview. Theauthor is only giving a small extract of the programming codewhich would be hard for someone to pick up without being morefamiliar with DirectX structure. Not very useful unless youknow some DirectX but then, does not give a lot more info ....especially for $49 ! Don't waste your money."
2,better to learn chord construction,"This book will be more useful to guitarists than to keyboardists, but for guitarists as well as for keyboardists it is still more useful to learn the principles of chord construction, voicing, and voice-leading than to consult a recipe book. For keyboardists interested in practical and theoretical information particular to the rock idiom I recommend PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
1,"Contradictory, untrue, and BORING!",I was interested to see this video and I was horrified by how stupid some of these guys were. They just plain made things up to suit their claim. When it came to part about Arminians helping to legalize abortion that was when I this sort of nonsense wasn't for me.This video is merely propaganda at its worst. I wouldn't waste your time.
3,Another Tooth Fairy Tale,"Lizzie knows other kids in school who have lost teeth and gotten something from the Tooth Fairy, but Lizzie's teeth are not loose yet. So she waits eagerly for a baby tooth come out.I suppose a child who is just learning about the tooth fairy might be intrigued by this story.It is an older book than most of the ones I've reviewed, first published in 1979, and the art was a little faded in my copy.This was a pretty general story about the tooth fairy. After reading it, I was positive I had read it before."
2,Be cautious,"I thought the price was amazing for this product since the total for 5 cartridges was less than the price of a single Canon brand cartridge. I installed all cartridges together on my S630. While the black cartridge worked fine, the color ones kept dripping ink from them after only a few weeks. Eventually, when I realized the bottom of the print head was saturated in ink from the color tanks, I just removed them and replaced them with the previous empty ones. To make matters worse, my printer stopped working all together because I needed a new print head. The new print head cost $52. My printer is an older model, but the timing was suspicious. In the future, I will stick with Canon brand."
3,cheap but cheaper quality,"The black works fine, my only complaint is that the ink is a bit heavy so it shows through the paper on the other side. The color ones worked for a bit, but it didn't come out the right colors and after a while they just stopped completely. From this, I'd much rather buy the authentic Canon ones because these don't guarantee anything."
4,Unique,Paul Ortega's album is a classic. It is timeless and original. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great.
4,fills a need,"As a USCF low class B player, I'm arguably a bit too low rated for this book. Tactics and end games, right? But I've always played 1..e5 and was struggling in the opening. Davies' book covers a large enough chunk of repertoire to make it worthwhile, and complete games are always nice (some of which merit study regardless of openings).I actually started with the back of the book, saving the closed Ruy for last. This is probably the opposite of what many will do. Davies doesn't dodge anything, but also doesn't give the same old lines. For example, he recommends Qf6 in the exchange Ruy and the 10..Bc5 in the Two Knights rather than 10...Bd6. The lines seem good, and I haven't been surprised by an opponent yet.65 games total and lots more in the notes. This isn't a Starting Out book, however, so the explanations are mostly through showing games/variations rather than talking you through the reasons for moves. In this respect, it's aimed at a slightly higher grade of player."
3,Davies OK,I like Davies method of writting so this book got a good rating from me. Could not get over all his recommendations to leave my favorites.
1,Assumptions all incorrect,"The assumptions here are that the government needs to fix the schools so they handle the disabled better.As anyone who has read the bold (and actually a fun book) Disabling America (ISBN: 0785262253) can attest, the schools only benefit by KEEPING students disabled and by labeling more and more each day who aren't.You need to keep your little ones away from the dark corners of the public schools. They cannot be fixed. Do not assume they are a given and then you need to fix them with Audrey's advice here. Institutions do not repent, they only get far worse."
3,Very interesting,"Interesting movie. Very different from what is being produced in the United States today. It contains more nudity than teasing amount in most main stream movies today. It also has several scenes of ""hard core"" nudity / sex that are absent in mainstream movies of today. Definately an exploitation movie but one that some of us enjoy."
3,Lackluster....,"I keep trying to like Emma Holly's stuff but am not having much success. The frist EH book I read was The Prince of Ice which was pretty interesting. So I thought I would try Demon's Daughter(ho hum). Then I wanted to give her another shot because she had done such a good job with Prince of Ice and bought Beyond Desire - snooze.The books both lacked true passion, true fire in the story itself. Not saying that she doesn't write an arousing bedroom scene, but outside of the bedroom scenes the books lacked ""life"". The stories were boring. They dragged. The characters lacked depth. They were basically corny. Perhaps it's simply her Victorian era stories that I find so lackluster but I don't think that I will be attempting any more EH books unless they're from the library. (Well..maybe if she writes a sequel to Prince of Ice) I would suggest Virginia Henley if you like a sensual historical romance with depth and grit."
2,Better books available for less...,"Its a fairly decent review of behavior analysis applied to theclassroom. I'd give it a higher score if it didn't cost $.. for a 300page cheaply made paperback. There is not much new in this book that hasn't been published elsewhere. Also, there isn't a lot of practical information for a teacher working for a school district. It's a typical undergrad college text. The book doesn't go far enough. For example, there is a section on group contingencies in the classroom, but no mention of ""Learnball"". Not much on discrete trial training either. Direct Instruction is mentioned, but the instructional strategy behind programs such as Reading Mastery and Connecting Math Concepts isn't discussed. There is a lot of excellent information in the book, its just that for cost I expected a lot more."
4,Reduced Price Makes Text A More Reasonable Buy,"I noticed a significant drop in price for this textbook. Therefore I'd like to revise my rating up to four stars. Schloss and Smith do provide a fine review of ABA in the classroom. Its a good solid elementary text. True some topics are not covered, but perhaps there will be a more advanced text in the future."
5,Cuddly & Soft,Bear is very soft & cuddly. The lighted belly slowly fades into different colors. A good value for the price. First one did not work but seller immediately sent a replacement.
4,A firm foundation for good health!,"The information in this book is very correct; but the book does not contain the pictorial illustrations referred to in the text. I am referring to the printed as well as the Kindle editions. The appearance of the pages is like a neatly typed thesis, done on a typewriter. If doctors today, were following Dr. Kellogg's understanding of the human body and its systems, I sincerely believe that disease as we know it today would not be so overwhelming to life itself. This is a very good read even for young people, adults and those who have studied medicine. If whoever deems to stay in good health, has this correct foundation on physiology and hygiene not only will their life be more enjoyable, but they would have an extra advantage of being able to point out the correct way for others to have a healthy, happy and more joyous life with their mind and body."
3,Okay plastic mag cover,"I just got this in today and it is okay. I wanted to use it for some magazines I have but it is way too big. I should have really measured out the sizes better before I bought it. It is still very sturdy and has a nice design. If your magazines fit the sizes described in the ad, it is a good buy but maybe a bit overpriced. Your call"
4,Sturdy good magazine protection,I was very happy with my magazine protectors. I purchased them to protect magazines I purchased to store for 20 years or so. I think these will do the job. They were not bent in any way. I'm very pleased with the product and qauick delivery.
3,Should use different packing for product?,Received item bent. Believe it was due to UPS because the box was crushed on the corner which bent the corner of the protector. So I haven't used it.
3,How To Hijack a Jumbo Jet Airliner and 360 Passengers!,"My first Tony Kenrick novel and I liked it--sort of! Serious most of the time; other times, a comical hoot. Audacious is the best word to describe it. A group of crooks: the sky cap, the caper's mastermind; the bookie; the pilot and his stewardess girlfriend; the programmer; and two baggage men; assemble to hijack a 747 jumbo jet, kidnap its 360 passengers, and demand $25,000,000.00 in uncut diamonds to return the jet and passengers unharmed. Meet two nuts: William ""Bill"" Verecker, lawyer, and his secretary/ex-wife Annie as they race to solve the mystery and cash in on a possible $100,000.00 reward. Nothing goes smooth for Bill and Annie, as they crash a religious cult's compound, cause chaos on a Hawaiian air flight, escape death at the gym, battle a neighbor over a parking spot, deal with tampered brakes, escape the clutches of kidnappers, charge airplanes, and escape explosions they cause."
3,Story Feels Fresh Despite Copyright of 1892,"A 1001 Books You Must ReadMr. Pooter keeps a diary in which he recalls all the events of his days. He seeks to attain social status, but, time and again, finds humiliation instead.The copyright date on this book is 1892, but the story feels as fresh as yesterday. Funny. A little sad. And, most of all, insightful."
5,Very Entertaining,Totally enjoyed this book and would recommend highly. There were a few times when I laughed out loud. Wish the story went on and on.
3,"little slow, interesting insight","I found it a little slow going overall. An interesting insight into day-to-day life of Victorian England, a diary written by an entirely humorless middle-managment, middleclass individual who is so stuck in the bounds of what he thinks his position is or should be he can't see any humor or fun in anything & is constantly worried about everything. I know this is supposed to be satire, but it mostly just came across to me as sad."
2,Could not finish,"This may not be a fair review of the book, as I did not finish. I read perhaps a quarter and finally gave it up, thinking of all the other books I had waiting. It simply did not capture my attention."
1,Not worth the time,"Perhaps this was funnier when it was originally written, but most of the humor in this book completely missed me. I did start to get interested in the main character towards the end of the book, but the ending was not very satisfying at all. If this type of story interests you, I would recommend that you read something by P.D. Wodehouse instead. (There are some free and/or inexpensive Kindle versions of Wodehouse available)."
2,disappointing,"once i begin a book, i generally finish it no matter what...this book however, started out slow, and i just couldn't focus on it so i put it aside for now...perhaps i will go back to it when i have nothing else to read..."
5,A very interesting book that makes you continue reading,"This book is indeed a book that makes you continue reading, due to its descriptions. The story shows clearly that it was written during the Victorian age. The friends and shopkeepers play an important role in the story."
1,A weak attempt at humor,I really found the book to be too dry. There is a very fine line between good British Humor and something that is simply flaky. This is flaky.
2,"Not so funny, after all","A decent book, but not as funny as I thought. It makes you smile, for sure, but don't expect it to make your sides ache. Boring chacarcters, non-existent plot. A big disappointment."
4,Easy read,I liked it because this simple story shows that even with all that we have today in many ways people and families have not changed from one century to the next.
4,Surprisingly entertaining,"I say surprisingly entertaining because I wasn't sure what to expect. The characters, time era, and location are totally foreign to me. That's why I gave the book a whirl. I was glad I did! I got so immersed in this quite average person's life. It was refreshing. It left me with a good feeling."
5,Pooter's Predicaments !,"I really enjoyed this book and the telling of how Family was during this time, we still encounter the same family problems today, so there are parallels.Mr Pooter's outlook on life has good intentions, but try as he may often ending in comical results.I would recommend this book and you feel the core of family life has not changed that much, trying to understand siblings behaviour etc. (Lupin )"
3,Interesting look into a bygone era,"Life.politic,love and religion with the customs of the times i enjoyed it a quick read life hasntchaged that much good book"
4,Maybe not The Odyssey,"Maybe not the Odyssey, but an interesting look into the life of that period. Didn't know what to expect but found it humorous."
3,A quick read,My first Kindle book and enjoyed it. Not terribly long and gives some funny moments as well as insight into an ordinary man.
5,A sweetheart of a book,"I stumbled upon this little gem while looking for other 'diary' type novels. So glad I gave it a try. The voice of the Victorian-era diarist is one of a quiet, dignified, and simple soul. He`s a family man who is decent, kind, and a little foggy. You get the sense that his wife and best friends love him and also wish to cheerfully throttle him from time to time... and his headstrong son thinks he`s a ridiculous towel. But the humor of parody is tucked into every page, and makes the slighly clueless Mr. Pooter endearing to the reader."
5,"Good Condition, On Time, Fun Read.","Book arrived in fine condition. Took a few weeks, but did arrive within the promised window of time.A fun read.. quite funny and whimsical, simultaneously showing affection for, and poking fun at, life in the suburbs in the late 1800s, but translating well to today's situation in suburbia and those timeless characters who are somewhat self-important and/or happy with the status quo. The illustrations add richly to the mirth."
3,well written,Not much of a plot; boring at times- I was waiting for something interesting to happen. Read this after you have read most everything else. I would be open to reading something else by this author though.
4,diary of nobody,I enjoyed getting a glimpse of the past. Reslized that the world has not changed as much as we would like to think.
3,Just ok,Other reviews said how funny this book is but I didn't really find it very funny. It's a fast read though and enjoyable.
3,Funny,I love reading diaries. It is fun to get in on what people are thinking about their life. This is a fun story.
4,charming and timeless,"I was reminded of this book after reading that George Grossmith spent many years with the Gilbert and Sullivan company and is portrayed in a very interesing fashion in the film ""Topsy Turvy."" It was available in a very inexpensive editon from amazon.co.uk and I read it quite quickly and found it delightful. It is truly enjoyable and informative to read the slice-of-life story of Mr. Pooter, an archetypal middle class creature whose idiosyncracies would be recognizable [and, unfortunately, beaten to death] in a current TV sitcom. His problems at home and at work, and his relations with family and friends, are delightfully communicated and it is fascinating to see both what is tied to his own time and what is recognizable to us, today. The story is lightly drawn but there is a subtle undercurrent of profound social commentary."
1,BEWARE CHEAP PRINT-ON-DEMAND editions of this book!,"I ordered the version of this book by ""CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (April 24, 2012)"" without paying attention to the publisher, and I regret it. This book is printed on full size 8.5 by 11 inch paper, all the way across the page, and looks to have been laid out in Microsoft Word. It is going to be hard to read because of the formatting -- those are long lines (there is a reason magazines use columns).Unfortunately, Amazon will probably put my review under every different edition of Diary of A Nobody, so please note this review is for a particular edition.I've got nothing wrong with well-done print-on-demand editions, but these companies need to at least apply minimum formatting standards to make their text readable."
4,Bird Feeder,Have not received it yet but the description seemed quite good.And the product is designed to fill my needs as there are a lot of squirrels in my yard area.I trust Amazon fully as I have never been disappointed when dealing with Amazon.Patricia
5,Great For Nursing,"I have this nightgown in hot pink and love it! It is comfortable to sleep in and makes it so easy to nurse. It's worth the money, in my opinion."
1,Great scanner Worst than poor customer service,I just recently upgraded my 3 other uniden scanners. I really like the BCT15 but it is somewhat complicated. So of course I needed to buy the director software that makes programming easier thru your computer. The uniden web site I felt was misleading because what I ended up buying was a registration key... not software for $29 dollars. You have to download the software then use the key. Well to this day I have not been able to download it. (Vista) I emailed uniden customer support (which takes them 3 days to respond) so that game went on for awhile. I then was on the phone for over a hour trying for a refund! Which they will not do because they are not sure whether you did download or not! When customer service finally put a guy named Josh on the phone and he told me he would burn me a disk and send it out right away I was happy. The disk never came and they claim they know no Josh. Nightmare.... say the least!
5,Uniden 2500-Channel Mobile Scanner,"I have owned scanners for 30 years or more,by far this is the best.This scanner has features that I cannot use here in Bermuda, but has many that I can.Thank you Uniden for a fantastic scanner......Henry Whitter"
2,Not as impressed as I hoped to be,I purchased this video after reading reviews from other buyers. I was not as impressed as they were. Denise and the two backup workout people often become out of sync during the video - so you really need to pick one person and stick with them rather than watching anyone else or it throws you off. The cues are not timed very well so I had to watch the video more than once in order to keep up. The music did nothing for me. I agree that I ended up with a good workout. I was sweating at the end and I am sure I burned calories - but it is not going to be my favorite workout. I prefer the circuit workout Cathy Smith has out - much better coordinated and you get the same workout (in a little less time).
4,"Good, Hardworking workout","I am a rather big fan of Denise Austin's workout videos. I started out with this one...and at first it was extremely hard for me to do, as I was very out of shape. However, within a few weeks I did that...and gradually began adding more things on. As a matter of fact, I use this workout regimen every day: In the morning I use Denise Austin's Power Yoga Plus, and follow it with Rock Hard Abs, then with EITHER Fat Burning Blast or Sizzler, and then a twenty minute trampoline excersize and then Denise Austin's Pilates video. I really enjoy her videos in general and This one works the arms Very well. I noticed burning in the arms and abs..the ab segment is really powerful too."
4,Great beginner tape!,"I highly recommend this tape to those who want to begin an exercise regimen. This is a wonderful tape for beginners. I must admit that when I first tried it, I was a bit turned off because of some of the little imperfections: Denise's assistants were all over the place, it didn't seem like they prepared for the taping and Denise's miscalculations (you just have to count for yourself!). However, if you can get past all that, this tape will definitely give you results (my biceps are now awesome)!"
1,Should have bought a different tape,"I bought this tape yesterday and I feel like I just wasted my money. Aside from the fact that Denise is more annoying than usual, I found this tape fast paced and hard to follow. I have exercised for a while now, and even then I found it complicated. I like the idea of cardio and weight training combined, but I didn't think this tape was challenging enough as far as the toning goes. You do use your legs a lot, but it does not do much for your upper body. The abs section at the end was ok, but as soon as you felt your abs 'burning' she would stop. If you really want to buy this tape look for it at the Salvation Army store where I'll be donating it tomorrow."
3,"Good workout, but a little hard on the joints","The only reason I'm giving this three stars is that this video is not for those who might have trouble with their joints. I have knee problems and found this workout really aggravated my knees and my back. I didn't feel really good as I usually do after a workout. I will say that the Ab portion of the video is excellent and that the entire video would be good for someone who does not have a problem jumping around. I don't find Denise Austin annoying - she looks wonderful and I'm sure she's doing her best to be encouraging. I purchased this video, Hit the Spot Abs, and Hit the Spot Thighs as a package deal and I must say the Hit the Spot Abs is also very good. I haven't tried the Hit the Spot Thighs yet."
5,This is one to add to your collection!,"I found this workout fun, energizing and it has great music. It's also great for all different fitness levels. It's interval training so you just add heavier weights as your level increases. I highly recommend this one."
2,"buy cheap, get cheap","Sadly, an adirondack chair for $99 is too good to be true---at least getting one of good quality is. The chair was very difficult to assemble: Especially the step when the arms were attached. It was impossible to keep the arms in place without cracking the wood where it connected to the back of the chair. Also, the wood was of poor quality, hence the cracking. Getting this product from Brookstone (or via you)turned out to be no assurance of quality."
1,"Never received item , so can't review.","We never received our order from Smitty's Electronic, so we can't give a review of the item we ordered on 4/10/2009, which is 36 days ago. We would like to have the product, but no one seems to know or care."
5,Thank you Rhino and Amazon,"Long have I wished for a return to my past. This is about as close as I can get so far. I have loved the Bugaloos and their music since I was a child. Seeing them again has brought back many fond memories. The DVD's are incredible. The songs have been in my head since I heared them the first time, and now I can hear and feel them again. I would like to know if there is any way I can e-mail long overdue fanmail.Send info to: RRgrDbe@aol.com"
5,Krofft Magic again!,I remember this show growing up. Excellent clean entertainment. You don't get this quality now in my opinion.
5,"history, adventure and fun",I very much enjoyed reading this book with my 9 year old son. It kept us both entertained and involved from beginning to end and brought me here to find more from the series.
3,Damaged Product,"This order was delivered promptly, but a section was damaged from the factory. I re-ordered that section, which came promptly, but it too was damaged in the same area! I then just had a friend repair the damage so the table could be assembled.I'm enjoying the table and glad to have it, but would never order again from this company. Too much trouble and can't trust the quality of their products."
4,My baby loves this dvd,"I can understand what the previous poster is saying about the volume. Being a non-Hindi speaker, I realized from my husband(Hindi speaker), that I was saying some of the words wrong. It is hard at times to make out what is being said.On the other side, I think it is a perfect dvd for children under 3. It is modeled after the ""Baby Einstein"" dvds. My baby is 11 months old and loves watching other children and babies. So, it is a perfect way to hold her attention as she listens to Hindi. She is starting to use some of the words and sounds. So, in that way, I think this DVD is very educational and helpful."
2,Not that special,"I was really excited about this flavor, but it turned out to be pretty blah. Definitely not worth the $5 I paid for it."
3,its small,"i havent given this to my 2year olds yet. its much smaller than i thought it would be. in the photo the bread, meat, tuna etc all looks a normal size. but its more like bite size. im going to keep it though, its still cute ill just have to wait till their older."
5,Awesome,My daughter and I love playing with this set. It's so cool to make a play sandwich and it doesn't fall apart :)
1,Jumbled Presentation,"I was disappointed with this film. I thought that since it came from the History Channel that it might perhaps go through the various viewpoints that have developed for interpretation of Revelation in the Bible. Unfortunately, most of the film was spent on really strange scary interpretations that miss the message of the Book. Additionally it seemed very jumbled in its presentation of the material."
1,Strange Perspective,"I did not find this film helpful. It focused on the strange imagery of Revelation without giving much help in interpretation or understanding. The film very briefly touched on different theories of interpretation, but this section was so brief that most will probably miss it."
3,Good information,I'm still researching all the facts and scripture to make sure it is all true or just good TV. Good to study with.
2,Disorganized Presentation,".I'm a great fan of the History Channel and have a strong interest in the Book of Revelations, yet I found this video to be nearly worthless primarily due to its lack of organization. Because it's a relatively short program (50 minutes), this results in its being lean on content.On the positive side, I found the discussions with the various academic experts to be worthwhile, although they seemed to be uncomfortable in such an overly dramatic program.Several years ago, I read that the Island of Patmos, where John is supposed to have written this Book of the Bible, is home to a special hallucinogenic mushroom, to which some people attribute his spectacular visions. Unfortunately, the program makes no mention of this theory.UPDATE (03/28/12); The eminent religious historian, Elaine Pagels, has just written an excellent book on RevelationsRevelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation. Better to spend your money on it than this video."
2,Misleading!,"I bought this thinking it would be a deep exploration of Revolations and its contents, it is moreless a brief overview of the concept and gives little else. It is very short."
3,plastic stripped easily,"This product worked ok, but as i used it to remove the flushmate part, the plastic began to get stripped. I saved it for the next fix I may have, but I'm not sure it will hold up for more uses! As I have 3 toilets with the flushmate system, I was hoping for a tool that would last through more fixes!"
4,A great pocket edition!,"If you are interested in natural family health, in a condensed, pocketform,--this is it! It has alphabetical listings of ailments, herbs,vitamin and mineral content of herbs, special diets for ailments,and much more. Excellent index. All in a purse/pocket form."
3,Dont know what to think yet,"I have enjoyed this player so far with the one big exception of the remote control: the eject/close button is mushy and odd enough to make me wonder if I got a defective remote. Does anyone else have this trouble? I have to press and press it to get the thing to work.Last night, for the first time, a video stopped in mid-play. I tried everything and finally had to unplug the player! I have always been able to work my way around this situation, using the remote (I couldn't even turn the machine off manually!!!)."
5,Great DVD player,Once taken out of the box the DVD player took only minutes to setup and get running. It's worked absolutely perfectly every time and we're very happy with it.
4,Great Buy,"I highly recommend this for style, utility and value. I have one caveat, however. If you intend to hook up this player through an AV receiver, make sure you have an open coaxial digital input, as the player's digital sound output is coaxial, and not optical. My receiver, for example, has three optical inputs and only one coaxial input. I was using my coaxial input for my cable box (which also has no optical output). I had to make a choice about whether I wanted digital sound from the DVD player or from my digital cable television programs."
5,THIS IS THE BEST IMPORT (1 of them)....,"MOre Heavy Angry crunch tone guitar work here. This cd is a musicians best friend, as the guitarist can really tear it up and comes up w/ a few unheard of licks etc. Get the album though, at least give it a listen....U'll be HAPPY!"
3,Not bad,"It is hard to find multidisc changers for DVD's these days, but this one works just as expected. It is a bit loud and slow to start up, but it functions well and comes with loads of features."
2,Why have a five disk changer that cannot shuffle?,I purchased a Sony 5-disk CD changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks. This model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time. What were they thinking? The ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs. a single disk CD/DVD player. THIS BABY IS GOING BACK!
3,"Great features, but not perfect","As other reviewers have pointed out this DVD changer is hard to beat for features and price. However, it's not perfect. I bought the 80V to replace a failing 3-year-old Sony 5-disc changer (the model number escapes me) and I'm slightly disappointed. The 80V has a terrible LED display -- it's dim and recessed, as if hiding in a cave, almost useless. This changer is also SLOW to turn on (it displays W-E-L-C-O-M-E slowly, letter by letter, each time you fire it up). And when you put in a DVD it takes much longer than my old Sony before it starts to play. You have to sit through a 20-30 second ""Loading"" message before the disc even starts. I can't knock the price or features, but after 3 months of trying to get used to it I'm looking for something better. My old Sony was much more responsive, so I don't know what they were thinking. Once the 80V gets going it's fantastic, but life is too short to waste on ""Loading."" :-)"
2,No!!!!!!! You didn't?!,"Oh my gosh, and this sells?I was so excited to find Bob Griswold and his CD's because I've had so much success with Hypnotherapy/Self-Hypnosis/Meditation, but no way, not this one! All he says is affirmations over and over again, in this TV Commercial type voice, you are strong, you are good, you are loved, you are special, you have self-esteem, Etc..., Etc...Etc..., and it just keeps going and going like that for the entire CD, I even think there was music, I just couldn't hear it!! If you like tons of affirmations said over and over and over again in a non-relaxing voice and format, and that's all, you'll LOVE this CD."
4,Relaxing and beneficial tape,I don't think anyone ever is 100% confident with their self image or self-esteem so we are always trying to reach a little higher. This tape is great if you commit to listening to it as often as it recommends. I certainly feel better about myself and find a major boost each time I listen. Three of my friends have also purchased it as a result of seeing how much it helped me. Thanks for a great tape!
1,rise and fall of japan,"Unfortunately, I have not been able to let the seller know the discs would not seat themselves on my DVD player. They do not settle in so the movie can play...If you have an address to the seller please send it to me as I am sure they would want to replace this with a functional copy...Many Thanks Ted511"
2,Paul Finebaum is a moron,I received this book as a gag gift and read it anyway. Paul Finebaum has had few origional ideas of his own and makes a living from bashing people and misrepresenting the truth. The jokes are recycled and stale. You can plug in any schools name in place of Alabama. I would recommend this book for bird cage liner or wrapping fish.
3,Splits the Difference,"Axes, Electrelane's third release, splits the difference between the instrumental raves of their debut and the more accessible post-punk of last year's The Power Out. ""Split"" may not be the most exact word here; nearly 75% of Axes is given to Feelies-style rave-ups - though without the Feelies devotional concentration or, pardon me, axemanship. Or lyrics - a problem when your instrumentals begin and end with the same basic chords and mid-tempo - fast - faster structures (no matter how much dissonance you throw in for variety). That said, there is still a dirty thrill to be had from the fuzzy rush of rock and roll played live in the studio, with Steve Albini's hands-off recording muddying up the sound. The songs are raw, skeletal, as if the band learned them seconds before playing them, which they probably did, with no time to belabor the obvious similarities as they rush from one giddy crescendo to the next."
5,Pretty good for the price,"Cheap, light and pretty looking. Fires descently and great if you dont want to be weighed down on the field. Fits in any standard holster."
5,Brilliant Shakespearean criticism,"Bradley offers some of the most eloquent, complete, and balanced criticisms of the tragedies that I have yet read. Unlike so many literary critics of today, Bradley does not disdain to view Shakespeare's characters as actual people, which lends his view of the works a sense of import and meaning which so few critics manage to convey. These lectures are necessary reading for anyone at all who wishes to understand Shakespeare's tragedies better, actors, directors, and academics alike."
2,Lightweight book...generic advice,"This book is mostly a feel good generic motivation book. Very VERY short on specifics for making money in real estate. There are many other books that are much better for both beginners and experienced investors. Reading this book was more like reading a magazine article than a tutorial on McKinney's successful methods.I give McKinney his due for what he has accomplished. But the ""approach"" referenced in the title is a mental philosophy not a step by step methodology."
3,Very Simplistic,"Interesting and contains some good ideas - but his ""maverick"" label quickly becomes too cheesy as does the so-called ""Frank McKinney way"" in a very high risk business involving millions of dollars on specuolation that a tiny percentage of the reading population will ever have access to. It comes close to self promotion."
1,Mr. McKinney authors his own reviews,"I just found out that Mr. McKinney authors the reviews you are reading (except for the truthful negative reviews) and so although I did read this book, I will not be commenting on it. I can not comment about any book whose author makes up his own reviews. He apparently also did this creative commentary on his own website, he knows he did this, and more importantly GOD KNOWS HE DID THIS!! Please get real and delete ALL the reviews that are not real, and maybe God will help you to sell this book."
1,This time-piece is a waste of time!,"For the price of the product, you would think the stopwatch would let you view/save split times- it does not. The face has high visibility in both day or night (Indiglo) and the stopwatch is massive- you can use it as a personal defense tool (if you need to throw it at an assailant), but the price is too much. Don't waste your time on this product!"
3,Timex Stopwatch,"Instructions are a challenge, but it is the only stopwatch I have found with the features I want and the size I want."
1,Poorly designed interface for reset,"This stopwatch isn't optimized for a simple start/stop/reset operation. So if you want to simply record duration of an event like a rest period for sets at the gym, this is horrid. In order to reset you hold the middle button(which is difficult to hold) for about 3-4 seconds. I usually accomplish this by smashing the stopwatch against a hard object rather than punish my finger with the extremely hard to press center button. This should really be a SINGLE touch.I'm very disappointed with this product, for that reason. It's also kinda huge."
1,Poor in many ways,"As a cross country and track&field; coach, I live and die by my stopwatch.1) Very confusing with poorly written directions (I build my own PCs, so I consider myself fairly savvy with technology).2) Watch says WR 50M, but obviously not rain resistant. Ever since I got caught in the rain at a track meet, the watch has intermittently stopped working."
2,doesn't reset fast enough.,"Nice font, big stopwatch, comfotable hold in hand, but the reset button for the basic stopwatch function needs to be held for a couple of seconds in order to reset...I needed that to be instant so I had to send it back."
3,What secrets? These are Bios...,"I was disappointed by this documentary. Rather than spending the 45 minutes going into the true ""Secrets of the Bible"" this was actually a historical timeline of the archaeologists who research the Bible. Now it's true that some of these people are interesting, however the life and times of the archeologists is hardly what I would consider ""The Bible's Greatest Secrets"". The documentary itself was a little over the top, trying to force mystery and suspense when there was really very little said. I would hope that there are better documentaries out there on this topic. This is not one I would recommend unless your interest is in the bios of the archeologists."
3,"Mysteries of the Bible - A ""So - So"" reaction","This DVD, in my opinion, was not up to the standards set by previous History Channel treatments of various Biblical subjects."
3,Pretty Good Composites Book,"I likes this book alot. It's not complete, but no composite book is ever complete. I would complement this book with Composite Basics by Andy Marshal and Composite Design Handbook by Jim Marske at Marske Airraft. Amazon's price of $25 is the best around."
3,not vindication for the price,"For true fans of Dashboard Confessional, this is nothing new. The only reason to buy this would be just to say you own it. ""Vindicated"" is an amazing song, granted; but most DC fans already have it through. . .less reputable means. ""Warmth of The Sand"" also is quite good. It also appears on a Vagrant Records comp called Another Year of The Streets Vol 3. That comp also has great songs by bands such as Saves The Day, The Get Up Kids, The New Amsterdams, and Hot Rod Circuit. In total is has 15 tracks, but it's a hit and miss comp. This version of ""Hands Down"" is on the So Impossible EP, which also includes three other amazing songs (""For You To Notice,"" ""So Impossible,"" and ""Remember To Breathe""). What I would suggest instead of buying this single would be to download ""Vindicated,"" buy Another Year On The Streets Vol 3, and buy the So Impossible EP. That way, you'll be getting a lot more for your money."
3,Who doesn't love this song?,"If you already love Dashboard, why do you need a review? If you don't know Dashboard, this is as good a place as any to start. They started all acoustic-y, and now they're all rock band-y, and this was right around that time the transition was made. This disc contains a little acoustic song, and a little rock anthem-y heartache song. Not the best example of either from this band, but a good start if you're looking to start getting your Carabba on."
5,Oxford Picture Dictionary,"I am a stroke with this. Oxford Picture Dictionary is warranted for him, and I am wonderful with the book."
3,Purchased for speech therapy,"""Gardener"" reference attached to my name by Amazon is irrelevant.This Oxford Picture Dictionary was recommended by a speech therapist for my wife, who had a stroke and has to rebuild her ability to recall words. Essentially this prooduct is the equivalent of a stack of picture flash cards, arranged by categories, and printed in book form. It looks like fun to use. However, first you have to be able to use the table of contents (relatively fine print) and pick out the category you think the word you are seeking might be in. That is not as easy as it sounds. Speakers of other languages may find this helpful for vocabulary building."
3,Comparing the 1998 and 2008 editions,"My ESL students looked at our classroom Oxford Picture Dictionaries and insisted on buying one. I accidentally bought the second edition, but upon seeing it, they preferred the first edition. The second edition has computer graphics so it looks more modern; however the pictures are fuzzier . The first edition pictures are clear, full and colorful but slightly simpler so they are easier on the eye. We all find it harder to concentrate on the vocabulary in the second edition. Also, the extra intro pages to the units are expendable. We'd rate the 1998 edition 4 stars instead of the 3 we gave the 2008 edition."
5,Great Practical and Up-To-Date Resource,"I bought this as a present for an Austrian friend. His English is fairly advanced, but wanted a resource to help review common everyday vocabulary. I was very pleased when I looked through the book. The layout and illustrations are good, topics are wide-ranging and relevant, and the words and references seem current and up-to-date. Also I was happy to find a resource with American English- the title with ""Oxford"" is a little misleading- this book uses American English!"
4,Great,This is great for English language learners. It's organized by sections and is easy to understand. The only drawback is it's ehtnocentric towards the USA and this wouldnt be good for english learners living in Britain.
3,No pronunciation guide under the pictures,"Nice idea, but it does only half the work. It shows you how to write the words and sentences, but not how to pronounce them, which is extremely important for ESL students. To see how a word is pronounced, you have to check the index, which works just like a regular, non-picture dictionary."
4,Good staff that I was searching for a long time,The book contains all I expected and it will help me to improve my English. This is the kind of dictionary that I was searching for.
2,the title of the book is confusing,"The book itself is all right as to the subjects dealt with. The pictures are very good. The point I don't like is that the book is based on American-Englishand as a teacher of English I like to teach real English and not American-English. Words like pants in stead of trousers, colors in stead of colours, neighbors in stead of neighbours and so on, paying in dollars in stead of pounds and a lot of American words that differ in meaning from the English words.When you are interested in the English language in general the book is okay, but if you want to learn the language like an Englishman it's not a big success,at least in my opinion.The title ""Oxford Picture Dictionary"" puts you on the wrong track!"
3,Sexually provocative chick lit (for the times),"Mildly entertaining and compelling story about several white, heterosexual, upper middle-class early 1960s suburban women who ""blossom"" sexually, for lack of a better term, with varying expectations, outlooks, and results. The novel was written for white, heterosexual, upper middle-class suburban women then in their 20s or 30s. A ""beach read."" 2.5 stars."
3,"basics good, but details are now out of date","The basic concepts in this book are good, but all the details are quite out of date. (For example, the statistics on how 61% of internet users are browsing with Netscape Communicator.)If you buy this book for the root concepts, you will be in good shape. But if you use the information as your guide to the current state of internet selling and choose technology based on it, please keep in mind that you will need more current references."
1,Info Out of Date,This book was published in 2002. Therefore the content in this book is drastically out of date. I would not encourage anyone to purchase the book until the content is updated.
5,A must for all Schumann lovers.,"John Eliot Gardiner's scholarly approach to the orchestral music of Robert Schumann has nothing fusty about it; in fact, the elegance and sprightliness of the music shines through, putting the lie to the old canard that Schumann was a heavy, unimaginative orchestrator. Besides excellent versions of old favorites such as the ""Rhenish"" Symphony and the Konzertstuck for four horns and orchestra, there are enticing rarities here, such as Schumann's apprentice G Minor symphony, the ""Zwickau,"" which isn't included in his official canon of symphonies. I cannot see why any true Schumann fans would not want to have this boxed set; it is a fascinating document, presenting Schumann's music much as he must have imagined it himself."
1,Big mistake!,"I was excited about this pump based on a presentation during my childbirth/breastfeeding class. I fell in love with it in the first few weeks of using it because its as comfortable as other reviewers said. Sadly, after using it for two months (2 times a week when I went to work) the motor gave out! Playtex replaced the motor at no charge only for it to burn out again in three months. After my one year warranty runs out in June, I'll most likely have to buy another pump. Stick with what's tried and true...Go Medela."
2,Not for inducing lactation....,"I am an adoptive mom that was told that this pump was hospital grade and it has not helped at all, therefore I would not reccomend it for those that are trying to induce lactation. I liked the concept of this item and it was comfy. I had this pump for a year and had to return it to the manucaturer 3 times because the pump body stopped working. I would not recomend this pump, at least not to adoptive mothers. The customer service was awesome though!!! They were understanding and helpful. I eventually ended up getting a refund and then buying a medela."
1,Painful!,"I purchased this pump for the ""comfort factor"". I have a bruised areloa & a open sore. Playtex rep said "" the motor is very powerful"" "" that is why it hurts"". She then proceeded to tell me to rub my milk on my breast before I pump, hopefully that will help. If not there is nothing they can do..."" Great customer service. I am very diappointed in this product and service. Now what am I to do??? Spend more $$$ to purchase a new pump? I guess so."
2,Research before you buy,"I received this pump as a shower gift. After bringing my baby home I tried it out. I had it set on the highest suction setting and it took forever just to get one ounce. After speaking to a lactation consultant I was told to try renting one of the hospital pumps because they are ""industrial"".The Playtex pump is fairly easy to assemble, and the carrying bag is nice. I could do without all the extra bags inside though. My pump makes a loud squealing noise when first turned on.Do your homework before making this investment."
1,embrace in pain !!,"Around three years ago I had my first son. I rented the lactina pump by medela, it was great, I would pump 15ounces in 10 min. On feb 17 of 2005 I had my sec son.A couple of months before, I had bought the ""EMBRACE"" pump. It was brand new, it had no reviews yet, but I thought, well, the price says it all. WRONG,my son had to stay in the hospital for two weeks, I got released the sec day, I get home, take out the pump from the 1 million bags and start pumping. OH MY GOD!!In a minute the star on the cups left a star on my skin but with NO skin. My skin fell off. I xchanged it for the medela pump in style which was the same price but keeps the skin ON your body, and not scabs for 3 weeks.I was able to provide more than enough milk to take to my son.Even with all the pain I managed to still pump for him. Playtex should stick to bottles and tampons."
5,I love this pump,"I was able to breastfeed my son until he was eleven months old, while working full time by using this pump. I used it with the One-Step Storage system, which made it easy for my husband to warm and give him his bottles while I was at work. The cups were super-comfortable, and after some practice, I had no trouble getting letdown. I could usually pump 4-6 oz per 15-20 minute session. I haven't noticed that it is any noiser than my friend's Medela. I haven't tried other electric pump, however, I did try an Avent ISIS manual pump and HATED it. This one was perfect for me."
5,wonderful pump,"I will be going back to work soon, but used this pump starting at one week postpartum. It is comfortable and easy to use.I breastfeed and suppement with a bottle at night so my baby sleeps longer. This pump has been wonderful! I use it at least 2 times a day when he sleeps so long and misses out on regular feedings. I am able to pump enough breast milk to easily store in the refrigerator or freezer. I would recommend this pump to anyone who will need one for going back to work or for having a convenient supply of milk around."
5,Better than the Symphony!,"After the birth of my baby boy, I rented the Medela Symphony from the hospital. That worked fine, but I knew I had to look at purchasing my own eventually.I use the DropIns system and love it, so I figured I'd give this a try. It was on clearance at a local department store, so I got it.I kid you not, I get at least THREE TIMES more milk per pumping session with this than I ever did with the Symphony. Yes, it's louder- but I think anything is louder than the Symphony! The power cord and tubing are a little bit shorter than I had hoped, resulting in less flexibility due to having to locate a plug, but honestly that's not a big deal.I'm thrilled that I purchased this-- it packs up so nicely and comes with anything you could possibly need. The silicone cups are so much more comfortable, and the areola massage works much better for me than the nipple-tugging on the Medela.As I mentioned, I get three times more milk per pump than before, and it's alot less painful. Worth it!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PUMP!,Do not buy this pump! The sales associate at Babies R Us really sold me on the great accessories this pump had. I work full time and thought the storage system was great. I had the pump for 3 months before it stopped suctioning! Luckily I had purchased the additional warranty. I received my next Playtex pump and it will not function as a double pump. The only way I can express milk is if I use it as a single pump. I have wised up and found out I can still use the Playtex storage system with other pumps - Medela is the best
2,Ouch!,"I had such high hopes for this pump. What sold me on it was the great looking pump cones that ""embrace"" your nipples. But it was not worth the money, it actually hurt and made my nipples very sore before their time, which held me back from breast feeding until they healed a bit. As well, we could get it to work for the longest time, there are way to many connectors/connections that can easly make your time very frusterating if your not pumping but trying to figure out where you went wrong in connecting something, and the manual is almost too simple that is does not help you much when you are troublshooting. I got another ""gold standard"" pump that is much simpler and more effective, and it starts with an ""M""..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PUMP!!! BUY THE MEDELA!!!,"My husband brought this pump for me when our daughter was two weeks old. I had the pump for two weeks and used it maybe four times, when the motor started to go bad. I called playtex and they sent me a new one. One week later that motor went bad. I called playtex again and received another pump, and yet again the motor went bad. That's three pumps in a little less than six weeks, and I need one because I work full time. However, when I called playtex to get my money back, which I still haven't received they told me I would need a copy of the original receipt, which I no longer had, and that I would need to mail the pump back to them at my expense. I asked to speak to a suprvisor and left a contact phone number. I've yet to actually talk to a supervisor, and I've called several times. Go buy the Medela breast pump, it's actually worth the money you're spending. If you do buy this pump, save your receipt for at least the first three months."
1,Frustrated First Time Mommy!!!,"How should I begin. I am very dissatisfied with the product. Since I am a first time mommy, I had my concerns on the different types of electrical pumps on the market. While at BRU, there was a demo on Medela and this one. I really liked the comfort of the soft cups. I had heard from other mommies that the Medela was the best. Now I wish I would have listened and purchased the old tried and true.I have only been using it for a few weeks, and the motor is already going out on it. It takes 40 minutes just to express 1oz from both breast. I contacted Playtex and they will not refund my money, but did offer to overnight a new motor. I will give it another try, if I'm still not satisfied I will have to bite the bullet and purchase the Medela pump.So my review on this product HORRIBLE!!!!!"
3,Not god's gift to breastfeeders like i thought it would be....,"I was pumping full time with my Avent Isis pump and was worried about my milk supply going down so I invested in one of these pumps. I watched the 30 minute or so video on the playtex website and thought it was PERFECT!I was hoping this pump would be faster since you can pump both sides at the same time. I have to control the buttons with my toes. Too bad people don't have 3 arms and hands. The avent pump gets about the same amount of milk in less time. I'm not impressed.I like that I can pump right into the bottles I use. The avent one can only pump into avent bottles and the playtex one can pump into any regular size bottle or any playtex bottle. However, it doesnt take avent bottles. I wish there was a pump that could take any kind of bottle! I'm going to try calling avent and getting a pump adaptor."
5,Versatile and fits well,"A great lid that works on so many of my pans. The vent took me a few minutes to figure out, but very handy once I did. The finish hasn't scratched yet (I've had it a couple of months), but I hand-wash it to make sure. A solid piece in my kitchen!"
1,You will be better of buying in local stores,The size of pans v/s lids is really tricky so better buy it in-store.Also it's heavy making the set(pot+lid) much heavier
3,Protective paint is peeling off.,"It does its job fairly well, but after a few weeks of mild use and being hand washed, the protective paint started to peel off. Also it is showing signs of rust at the ventilated knob opening. I can't recommend this product."
1,Don't bother...,"I purchased 4 of these lids as holiday gifts and upon inspection, promptly returned them. First, the packaging was horrible. Amazon had put the lids in a huge box with almost no protection and ALL of the lids arrived scratched. Unfortunately, even if they had been well packed, the quality of the lids was very poor. I believe that in life, you get what you pay for, but this was a rip-off. The quality was so cheap - two of the plastic handles were broken and jammed and the other two looked like they wouldn't last either. This is the kind of low-quality product you would expect to find at the 99 cent store... even then, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't buy them. Don't waste your time/money."
1,A piece of junk would've been better..,"I've got this about 3 months ago and already now when I put water on its inside face, the water becomes black and gooey. This gives an idea on what drops on your boiling food when using this piece of junk. It's going to garbage."
3,"12 "" Universal Pan cover",I was pleased with the cover but would have peferred a glass one. The fact that the handle turns so you can let steam out or turn to keep it in was a plus.
3,"Great for the price, but not long lasting","I had purchased this ~2 years ago to use primarily as a lid for my stainless steel skillet. I've been known to also use it as a lid for my wok. It has done it's job well for these 2 years. Unfortunately, a few months ago the coating of the lid starting flaking off. At first I shrugged it off, but now I'm starting to catch little black flecks after running the dishwasher with it. I don't know if it's from the dishwasher (never got any instructions) or the oven or what. I'll probably end up getting a stainless steal, uncoated lid now. But for the price, it makes a great mid-term solution."
5,Nordic Ware 12 inch lid,"I was very impressed with the Nordic Ware 12-inch Lid. I bought it because I had a couple of skillets that needed a big lid and I couldn't find any, but I ran across this one and you can use it on all sorts of sizes of skillets. It is the best thing I have gotten in a long time and to be so reasonable."
4,Nice Product,"It serves it's purpose, especially when I'm using my 12 inch skillet to fry food or saute plus it has the vent that you can open and close depending on what you're cooking."
5,Works great!,"Okay, so, you really don't expect something that will outlast your kids for under 15 dollars, right? This lid works great for my two fryers. I love the vent on the handle. I must admit, the first one arrived dented and with a cracked knob. I went online, did the UPS pickup return, the next day I had a new one and UPS had picked up my old one. How do you beat that? I mean, yes, it would have been nice if it arrived in tip top shape, but it didn't, and I had a new one the next day.I've cooked with it twice now and run it through the dishwasher three times (once upon arrival). It has held up nicely. It even survived getting put away by an overzealous nine year old. I really can't complain one bit about this product. It does what it is supposed to and was dirt cheap. If I have to replace it in two years, who cares..."
1,Not Worth the Money - Arrived Broken,"The ring under the knob was broken into pieces when it arrived. This item is cheap. Not worth the money. I'll be going to a store this weekend to buy a 12"" lid. I'll probably end up paying less for a better item. I still have to go through the hassle of returning this piece of..."
4,"not what i expected, but i guess it works","My husband and I found a perfect non-stick pan, except it was a skillet that didn't come with a lid. After searching local stores, we decided to get this one. We were looking for a lid with a clear glass lid. You see what you want to see, right? So we thought this was a clear glass one. It's also very light in weight. But so far neither have been a problem. And like all universal lids, it doesn't ""fit"" into the pan. It's more like it ""covers"" over the pan."
3,"Fits TFal Pro Pan, Thin but Works","Fits on the popular 12.5 inch TFal professional non-stick pan (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWG0T2)Rather thin, and not entirely flat (small gaps allow some steam to escape).The knob is plastic, but it seems fine, can be twisted to open or close a small vent, and has performed fine.I don't understand the high prices on universal lids, this seems the best deal for the money if you need something to fit a 12.5 inch pan."
4,"good, but not great","i bought this so that i could finally throw out my VCR. who cares a lot? was probablly the only VHS i still own and watch regularly. it is presented here on DVD and looks quite nice. this also contains a very dated show from brixton academy. it's unfortunate that this couldn't have contained a later faith no more performance, seeing as patton got better by leaps and bounds. aside from how mediocre his voice is on this live performance (and don't kid yourself into thinking that it is), this is completely worth getting for the videos."
1,Excessive Errors DO NOT BUY THIS ! Wait for 2nd Edition.,"Far too many errors to be useful. I there was a rating below one star this book would get it!I can only repeat this comment:""On average, there is one error per 2 pages of this book! Really. It's unbelievable that McGraw Hill would let something like it out. It's not just the explanatory text, but the sample questions are full of errors, too. ""So you must know LotusScript pretty well to be able to identify the errors and understand that the book is wrong and not you. This is not of any use if you are using this book to prepare for the exam.I have written to McGraw Hill but got no response so far, I believe they owe anyone who has purchased this book an update. There is no errata for this on the web site (and the book has been out for 7 months)."
3,Use with Caution,"I am studying for my Principal Developer exam. I am only through the first chapter, and I am concerned. When the title included displayed the wrong exam number (190-291) instead of 190-273, I was on alert. Fortunately I received my copy for free. I am certain the material is useful, but if you have to critique it as you go -- its too much. Trust -- but verify!"
5,On target,"I use this book to keep motivated. Find it helpful with the change process. Looks at all aspects of activity and has very helpful forms to keep track of progress in specific areas. Feel photos need to be updated. Gives impression this is ""old"" information. Size of typeface is good and love the algorhythims. Disappointed that pain is not mentioned as a barrier as this is a very common problem for people who are inactive. On the copy I received the cover says, ""20 Steps to Lifelong Vitality"" as opposed to 20 weeks."
4,Came better than expected,i purchased this book for a class i needed to take this semester. when i received this book it came in better condition then i thought it would be . it was shrink wrapped and everything. i a really happy with this purchase.
5,Excellent,"As a new mom, I recommend this video to any woman wanting to tighten up those ""problem areas"" caused by pregnancy! It's easy to do and really does give you the results it promises, and quick enough to fit it in between bottles and naps! I suggest combining this with HydroxyCut. The two combined has helped me lose 5 pounds just this week! One thing it doesn't tell you though: You also need weights and a yoga mat. I recommend 2lb. weights to start with, then move up to 5lbs. after 2 weeks or whenever you get used to it. Also, ankle weights will make it more challenging but aren't necessary."
3,Okay workout dvd series,"I was definitely sore after these workouts but I found them to be really redundant and boring. Also, what is with the teeny tiny outfits?! I mean... they are really tiny! And some of the girls look obviously uncomfortable with the tiny boy shorts or bikinis that keep creeping upwards (if you know what I mean). Also, I think there should be at least one workout dvd that has ALL of the muscle groups or at least two combined. It's annoying that each dvd just focuses on one group. I would like to get more out of my workouts."
3,Good starter workout,This video is a good start for someone who is just getting into working out. I did it for about two weeks and kind of got bored of it since I was looking for something a little more intense.
5,Loved it!,"I started doing these dvds a few years ago. Fresh out of high school, never exercised a day in my life, but after a trip to Greece, my usual 110lb body had plumped up a few pounds, and since I had never been to the gym I wanted to start working out at home. These were great for beginners! I used them for a few months then graduated to Jillian Michaels workout dvds in conjunction with working out at the gym, now I just go to the gym! If I did these again now it would be way too easy, but for beginners they are great! Pretty girls, pretty scenery! Try it!"
5,Excellent Workout with new moves,I work out all the time and this the first workout I have seen in a long time with some new moves. Moves I have never seen. I own many many workout dvds. This is a great way to get in shape and toned in 20 minutes per workout. I have done the buns and arms series. I know the abs and legs would be amazing too. I would highly recommend this to anyone. It is a little challenging if you are a beginner but worth it if you want to push yourself. Great for even the advanced.
2,Boring....,This was a very boring video. I paid 30 dollars for junk. I mean i feel the burn and it's an ok video but i don't want to be there for 30 min. counting every second before it's over. don't waste you money.
3,"It's a good warm up, but I find it lacking","I must have had my hopes up for these DVDs but I found it lacking and left with a feeling of impartiality (thinking, ""eh whatever""). All the discs together make for a good warm up, but that's about it. If you're a novice to working out and are just getting into it, then good on you and give it a shot cause it's better than nothing. However I find it's kind of hard to take a workout instructor seriously and maintain motivation for the workout when she's wearing jewelry, makeup, and has her long hair down. If you are looking for a a nice warm up then sure try this out, but if you want a workout and expect to actually achieve some results then I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Envy Girls 4 Disc Set,I thought this was going to be a high impact exercise video. It was everything but that.
2,Not what I thought,"I bought this expecting it to be challenging, but it was not. I honestly probably won't do any of these again."
2,Not a FULL SCREEN.,"I bought this on sale at my local DVD store. I have a Large Widescreen TV. the Workout Video only filled up a small square in the middle of the screen. Is this normal? thats why i only gave it 2 stars. Otherwise i would have rated it higher.If anyone else has this dvd would you please comment, and let me know if yours is the same way? I'm wondering if i got a defective copy. It doesn't seem like the manufactuer would make the screen small on purpose but who knows. Thanks :)"
2,Fake reviews and an OKAY workout.,"I use reviews to guide me through many of my purchases, and it has also led me to many fitness products that DON'T work. I should have known better when I looked on Amazon and another source, maybe two or three days after the DVD's release date, and saw the SAME review. Not only that, but it was positive and ""highly recommended the workout DVD"" without any cons. Also, look on this page. Look how similar the reviews about this DVD are, and note that the accounts only did one review and they are all from Los Angeles. Noticing all of this, was skeptical. Still, I ordered it.The DVD wasn't what I expected. The warmup was good and the exercises weren't difficult but efficient, although I have not seen noticeable results yet. There's something about this workout that makes me not look forward to doing it, and I was trying to find a fun workout I liked.Well, slick marketing skills, Envy Girls. You got my money and I'm slightly unsatisfied."
4,It's Okay.,"I love the dvd, but if you're used to doing tougher workouts, this dvd won't push you hard enough. You'll find that you might have to increase the weight of your dumbbells to compensate for a tougher workout. But it fits great in my home library because I live in a 3rd floor apartment, and there's no jumping involved nor obnoxiously loud music that would disturb the neighbours.There's just a few things that need to be mentioned. Sometimes the main instructor does not have proper form: Arms of envy, but she's not too far off.I would recommend this dvd for those that are beginners, and even those that have a living situation like mine."
5,Best workout!!,I bought the Envy Girls dvd and this is proubly the BEST workout system I have tried! I love that before the actual workout it does a warm-up for a few minutes and even just the warm-up you sweat! It takes you step by step and works like all of your muscles in just the first dvd! When Im done with the first dvd Im covered in sweat and pretty tired out but I can feel my body like wanting to do more! It's really fun and really helps the muscles! I totally recommend this to women who want to see and FEEL results! It it a great workout and it's fun!!
2,Just bad.,"I usually don't review stuff, but I really thought this deserved one. This workout video is mediocre in my opinion. The warmup isn't cued well - they just move from one movement to the next. Also, the girls looked either super bored or were smiling self-consciously every ten seconds - they really had no enthusiasm. My biggest concern with this DVD was the lack of direction about form and posture, which could lead to an injury if you don't know what you're doing. Honestly, any sort of leading in that areas is completely nonexistant. This DVD has decent workouts, but overall it's super cheesy and very disappointing. There are much better workout DVDs out there (SELF magazine has excellent ones)."
4,ONLY if you want a good workout...,"Okay, If your looking for a good work out this is for you. That is, if you can get past the incredibly cheesy ""ENVY"" girls. It seems like their trying way to hard to model for the camera and be sexy when doing the workouts. I mean the ACTUAL work-out itself works and is pretty good when done right but as for the girls...I just think its kinda ridiculously hilarious. haha"
4,great workout,"I bought this DVD set back in Feb. and have been using it consistently every since. The routines are fun and fairly simple to follow. In addition to a 20 or so minute routine for abs, buns, legs, and arms (each on a separate disc) there is an easy to follow warm-up as well as 5 minute routines if you're strapped for time. My favorite routines are the abs and arms, although Vala, the instructor on the legs work-out, is the best instructor. My only complaints are the other three instructors aren't very good as far as showing you a move before you begin and their outfits are ridiculous. Seriously, who wears a cowboy hat and bikini to work out? Overall, I enjoy doing these routines and feel like I've gotten a really good work-out when I am through."
5,A Great Workout!,These videos are great. After doing the butt workout I could barely walk. I really like how the workouts give you a cardio workout as well as toning.
1,Just another Reno-benteen hatchet job.,"This is a sloppy and inaccurate history. According to this partisan ""hatchet job"", Reno and Benteen just ""sat around talking for nearly an hour and a half"" while Custer was fighting for his life. Bologna--they were trying to survive.Read the reports of General Sheridan and US Grant about Custer's defeat at the Little Bighorn for the real story--Custer was impatient and looking for glory. He divided his already small force and the Indians defeated him because he was severely outnumbered. Blame Custer, not Reno, who just managed to survive, barely. Custer was warned by his scouts that he and his men would die if he attached the Sioux and they were right."
5,A very Satisfied Coustomer,I purchased this product fo my new cellphone from Amazon because I knew that I could find it less expensive here then at the wireless dealer. I was greatly surprised to find the unbelievable price. When this product arrived only a few days later the quality was very good and better then I thought it would be considerring the price. I have told others that have the same model phone about the great deal and quality and told them to go Amazon to purchase one.
3,You get what you pay for,"For $5, not a bad but not a great intro CD to some famous and not so famous blues greats. You get 4 classics, but I can't understand why they doubled up on John Lee Hooker and Elmore James. They could have used those spots for a couple of other guys. Still, for a CD with ""Boom Boom"" ""Red Rooster"" ""The Thrill is Gone"" and ""The Sky is Crying"" all on it, not bad. What makes it worthwhile are the offerings from Lightnin' Hopkins and Jimmy Reed."
5,The Confederette,"GREAT BOOK!! The Confederette is a book you can't put down. From the first page to the last you were totally living the story as a single woman in the South with guts to survive her life of tragedy, friendship and love. Each character was so descriptive and the scenes so vivid. I am hoping that Ms. Stadler has started her second book. I will be waiting. I have passed the book on to friends and they are enjoying it as much as I have."
5,Dog lover,"We had to put our real Collie down due to illness which was quite upsetting to my 10 year old son. I googled a stuffed collie and found this on Amazon.com. This stuffed animal is adorable and has been a great source of comfort to my son. He sleeps with it every night (it's snuggled in tight with him all night long), he hauls it everywhere except school and it's still in great condition. We've had it for a month now. I'd definitely recommend it."
2,"I'm sorry, but...","Are you sure, that he is a popular criminal in Hungary? As I live here, I just can't find any sings of him being beloved. As he is a bank robber. He was a great sportsman - before. But that doesn't mean much if it's about crime. Sorry, if this may sound a bit harsh, but really, he is no hero at all. At least not in our community."
5,Impossible To Put Down,"Grab a copy of The Ballad of the Whiskey Robber for your next flight and you won't even mind sitting in the middle seat in coach.If you relish a true story woven with elements of suspense, humor and romance, Mr. Rubinstein delivers these and more.Hard drinking Attila Ambrus just wants to BE somebody contrary to his father's prediction. Attila amazes the reader with the lengths he goes first to survive and ultimately to get the attention he so desperately craves."
5,Great sleuthing!,"wonderful reading! Masterfully written, engaging storytelling, apart from the occasional factual mistakes (ZTE being a Budapest club??) and quite a few spelling mistakes of Hungarian words - but that does not lessen its value for the English-speaking reader. Not only a page-turning criminal story of the ""gentleman robber"", but also a sensitive and very accurate portayal of the aura of the early 90s Budapest. It was quite an expreience to revisit the city of my teenage years through the eyes of someone who hasn't lived there at that time, and still could capture it so accurately."
4,Fun true crime!,"I really enjoyed this sort of biography/true crime story of this Hungarian thief, Attila Ambrus. It was a really fun book with some very funny anecdotes. And it certainly was not a dull biography at all! Rubinstein captured a remarkable life and did a wonderful job of spreading Ambrus' story in a fascinating fashion. All in all, I really liked it. I especially liked all of the facts about Hungary, too. In summary, this was an educational AND highly entertaining read - and one that I definitely recommend reading. I can't wait to see what topic Rubinstein tackles next!"
2,mediocre writing,"Interesting story, but the writing is distractingly bad. Instead of being a gripping tale of comedy and chaos, this book reads like wannabe Hungarian noir."
2,Ballad of the Whiskey Robber,"I'm afraid I didn't get to the end of this tedious tale. It was so badly written that I lost interest very quickly. Repetitious, lacking credibility and sloppily structured, it also lacked credibility.It has got rave reviews and sounded promising. But having lived in post-communist Hungary, there is nothing romantic about bank robbers or any criminals.I was living half-way up a mountainside in rural Spain but even that didn't spur me on to finish.Good robbers don't necessarily make good writers and with his ill-gotten gains he would have been better to invest in a ghost writer.Sorry, it gets a thumbs down from me."
2,No instructions,My so called kit came without bolts or instructions. Looks pretty lika a straight forward install but I will further update when it warms up and i tackle it.
5,**Just what I was looking for...that only I can see!**:),"I recently got one of your Ultra Secret diaries, I really enjoy it. It's perfect if you have a nosy twin sister like I do, who tries to read my diary. Because even if she does find the key and gets the diary open she still can't read a thing. That's what I love about this diary."
3,Too pricey for a piece of plastic,"I believe that Yakima should put a disclaimer in bold letters on their roof rack specs that if you install the rack then you would be hold up to cough up an extra $60+ or more for a piece of black plastic with a logo and a few braces to attach one to the rack. The bare rack starts making an awful howling noice at as low as 40 miles/hour and it get completely unbearable at over 55. Some people think it looks cool. May be. Some think it takes extra toll on gas mileage. May be - my wife who drives our Rogue has starting complained that she has to put gas more often now without even knowing that I have read similar complains on the Internet. It did solve the problem though, at least most of it and the noise is much lower. I wish someone has started an aftermarket competing product (hint-hint)."
4,Yakima Roof Rack Fairing,"I alway thought people added the fairing to the rack for looks, but now that I have a rack I know the real reason. The wind noise is unbelieveable without the fairing. It works great, but I only gave 4 stars because it seems too expensive for a big piece of plastic that advertises Yakima."
3,"Color and szie wrong, but quality good.","The picture of the fairing I ordered was all black. When the fairing came it was white and black. Not a big deal, and the color pattern is fine because my car is black. Also, the fairing was not long enough to fit all the way across the rack. A few inches of the rack are exposed on each side of the fairing. Again, not a problem, the fairing works.The quality is fine and the fairing does its job. It is also very easy to install. A little dissappointed overall but not enough to deal with the hassle of a return. I would reccomend purchasing the fairing from a local distributor so if the same problems are experienced you can simply exchange the fairing."
4,easy installation,"easy on, has worked very well, didn't run without it so I don't know if it reduces wind noise but it certainly doesn't add any. Can be flipped around so you don't have the lettering visible."
3,Reduces noise but I have taken it off my car,"The fairing comes with padded feed which stick to the bottom the plastic pieces that would otherwise touch the roof. After a few months, the padded feet gradually slid off center from melting glue. Trying to peel those off, clean things up and replace them wasn't worth the time for the limited difference in noise."
5,Cuts down on wind noise,"I know this seems like an extra accessory that you just don't need to spend the money on, but I would recommend you buy it! Saving $60 is not worth the wind noise (depending on your vehicle) that you may have to deal with. I bought it and I've happy with it."
5,"flawless, best price by a long shot,","Shipping was slow, but it was a bulky item. the fairing was new and unopened. Amazon hooked up free shipping. the price was much less than anything else out there (less than used fairings on ebay). Cut down wind noise sufficiently. If you don't have a fairing for your rack you need one."
3,Looks Great - Noise Still A Problem,"Okay, this ""fairing"" looks cool on top of my Toyota Tacoma and it hides the roof rack. However, it does very little to cut down on wind noise. I was really surprised at how much noise it still allows. Instead of thumping the roof, the wind now whooshes loudly. If you don't have the music on, it takes some getting used to. Without the ski rack on top, it is easily stolen by unscrewing the bolts (although I don't know who would steal a 38"" X 3.5"" piece of plastic). It's amazing what we buy to make things look ""cool"". Thule also makes nice looking `fairings'."
3,yakima roof rack fairing,"I suppose I may have expected too much in any product's ability to reduce wind noise of a roof rack. At turnpike speed, the fairing helps but does not eliminate the noise created by the rack. Strong side winds, or quartering from ahead cause the most noise, and of course the fairing works best when traveling in the same direction as the wind or at lower speed. Still noisy, but not to such an extent!"
4,noise eliminator,"It is very effective as a noise eliminator but rather expensive for a strip of plastic. The mounting clamps can interfere with the mounting clamps of the other devices for bike mounts, etc. I would consider fabricating one myself for the price."
5,Fairing Reduces Wind Noise,Easy to install.Significant reduction in wind noise with the fairing than without.A must buy if installing a roof rack!
4,"Save gas, reduce noise, collect stickers","I purchased the Yakima fairing and have now been using it for over one month. It does what it says, saves a few miles per tank on gas and reduces wind noise by about 70% on my Subaru wagon. I think it actually makes the rack look better as well,"
3,Murder Obsession,"This is not one of the best Giallos of the period. The production is low budget and the effects are crude, but if you are an Italian completest like I am, it is a must for your collection.it is beautifully shot and the transfer is crisp and clean. The lead actor is also a hottie for the 70s-80s So thats a plus.... Its a good movie for a rainy dark night."
4,4 stars for murder obsession,"this film does have its moments,and an eerie soundtrack but it is kinda weak but ricarrdo frieda won me over iguana with the tongue of fire that,s why i searched this title out.thanks,david"
3,Better than the movie...,"David Gerrold (he of Star Trek ""Trouble With Tribbles"" fame) takes the worst ""Planet of the Apes"" movie and turns it into a passable, enjoyable novelization. Though it has a light page count, this book doesn't suffer from the paltry budget the filmmakers labored under, so it comes across as a bit more powerful than the film.Gerrold also manages to give the apes, humans and mutants who make up the cast believable inner lives. Even Aldo, the brutal, villianous gorilla general, has motivation. Gerrold's descriptions of the ruined New York, and the marauding mutant army paint mental pictures much grander than what you'll see on the screen if you dare watch the movie. Plus, the novel contains a few deleted scenes that broaden the action's scope and provide context for the earlier films.If you're a ""Planet of the Apes"" fan, it's well worth your while to hunt down a copy. If you're not, check it out anyway, and enjoy an oddball bit of pop culture."
3,Nice case,"The case is very nice. Not sure if I will use the neck strap. The extra battery is very useful. All in all, it is a good deal because it would cost more to buy each item separately."
3,Comment on Canon camera case,"The extra battery is the main attraction in this package. The leather case is just large enough to hold the camera itself, with no place for extra battery, extra memory card, battery charger, etc. In retrospect, I would rather have searched for a slightly larger case with room for those items. Additional note: between the camera (SD800IS) package and this one, I received 3 wrist straps, which seems a bit much."
3,Much need accessory.,Get this accessory for your camera is you have one of the cameras that accept this combination. The case fits like a glove to protect your camera and the extra long strap is really handy! An additional battery is a no brainier and this is the best way to get it all for less!
1,Pony Express via Amazon,"-Not sure how else Amazon could screw up a re-packaging deal with OEM parts other than to take 14 days to ship - ?!! Whatever you do, please look for another seller - this experience was absurd!"
3,Disapointed,I was not happy dealing with this company at all. The camera I ordered was pictured as the Canon 850 They sent me the SD700 I will not deal with this company again.
3,"good pouch, useful battery but the rest...","...is not worth spending money on. if the pouch (excellent leather one) and battery together come out to be cheaper if bought separately, go for that rather than get the 'kit'."
4,"Okay, but....","All the pieces were there, but it looked like the package had been kludged together from other items, rather than the authentic canon package."
1,The SD Camera Case,"The Case is too small. Cannot put extra battery and cleaning lens cloth.The leather is of poor quality, in fact it is vinyl. The design is below par. The retail price is way too high for the product. Very disappointed that the accessory is of such poor quality. (including the chain) I can do better job than that. CANON brand name is on the line."
2,"Except the battery, nothing I can use.","I bought this pack mainly for the battery since it is only a couple dollars more and I'm getting a leather case as well which I might be able to use.However, the only thing I can use from this pack is the battery. The metal neck strap will eventually scratch the camera if I use it since it is METAL! Plus I've never seen anyone hanging their camera in this size on their neck and have it bouncing on your chest when you walk.With the case, it doesn't fit my Canon SD870 in their. It is just way too tight. When I pull out the camera, either I have to pull the attached strap so hard that I'm afraid it will break, or if I grab the camera, my thumb will pull and break the battery compartment door.I would recommend either PSC-50 or PSC-90. Try it at your local store to see which one fit the best of your camera and order it online for a cheaper price."
3,No room for the battery,"Ended up buying this and only using the extra battery. The case is too small to hold the camera and an extra battery at the same time. It's only big enough for the camera itself I wish I'd saved myself the trouble and just bought the Canon battery.Five stars for the battery, one star for the kit."
4,Good Deal,"You get the camera case plus the extra battery for the price most places charge for the battery alone. The case fits well and protects the camera. I hated the plastic-encased metal chain that comes with it -- it's heavy and cuts into your neck. I replaced it with a heavy-duty cloth lanyard that is easy to clip on and off, which also makes it easier to get the camera in and out of the case."
2,CAMERA CASE,THE CONTENTS OF THE ACCESSORY KIT ARE AS FOLLOWS:NECK STRAP - GOODBATTERY - GOODCAMERA CASE - FAIR TO POORTHE CASE NEEDS A STRAP OF IT'S OWN. USING THE STRAP THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE CAMERA MAKES IT DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING TO REMOVE THE CAMERA FROM THE CASE. I WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE A MORE SUITABLE CASE. THIS OFFSETS THE VERY GOOD PRICE THAT I PAID FOR THE ACCESSORY KIT.
4,good value,"I am SO glad I bought this accessory kit, because of the extra battery. The case is nice, but I wish it was slightly bigger with a pocket to hold extra memory card/battery. At least it protects my camera though! It was a good value for the price, and if I had to go back, I'd buy it again!"
5,Case is the best part,"I normally carry small digital cameras in my pants pockets, but they can get scratched by keys and coins. I put this case on my belt and my SD camera fits like a glove, is instantly available, and never gets scratched. It looks rather like a cell phone on your belt, so doesn't attract a lot of attention.Some reviewers complain about having to thread the handstrap through the little hole in the case flap. Why? Don't bother...just let the strap protrude from under the flap. This is truly a non-issue.Battery--I'm glad to have a spare battery, but to be honest, no matter how much I use my SD800, I've never run out of battery power, so I'm not sure a second battery is a must, the way it is with some other cameras.Given this, you might want to buy just the case instead of this kit."
2,Below average,"Case: made in China case has stiff leather and mine had a strong chemical smell (aniline or a phenol derivative, neither are ""nice chemicals"").Neck Strap: downright silly, unless you are into wearing flashy metal chains. The serrations will dig into neck on warm days after a period of use. Not comfy.Battery: Only thing useful. I should have gotten a spare battery and ordered a nice case somewhere else. There are lots of after market choices."
4,poor case design mars the kit,the kit is a good value but the case u need to be careful of it can scratch the lcd if u pull the camera out quickly because it is made of hard leather that barely flexes and has a steel button that will mar the lcd. Besides that its a great bargain for the careful camera user.
1,Do NOT Buy for SD950 IS,"After reading about this incompatibility, I went to BB with my 950IS and sure enough the camera has to be pushed with enough force you think it might scratch the camera. Very uncomfortable for a high priced (but worth it) camera. And then use extra force just to pull the flap down and engage the snap. The fit is so tight that the LCD screen protector I put on it started to peel off just because a tiny bit of it was on the edge of the screen.Probably great for the smaller SDs, just not recommended for the 950IS. We went with a LowePro at BB."
3,Not bad Not great,I am not sure it is worth the price. The normal battery lasts a good amount of time. The case is nice but you could probably get one cheaper
3,Moderately useful,"I bought this because I wanted an extra battery and thought the other items would be useful, too. They really aren't. The case fits the camera perfectly but I wish it had left a little room for the backup battery."
4,Good product,I was looking for a compact leather case for Canon SD 880 and this is perfect. The neck strip is not good but the case is completely worth it
2,Case smallish for my SD880; uncomfy neck strap,Just a heads up to those who want to use this for the Powershot SD880: It's a VERY snug fit. Hard to get in and out of the case. The neck strap is uncomfortable and heavier than it needs to be. I'd like to return this but the shipping/return process makes it not worth it. :-(
4,canon digital accessory kit,"Great purchase for me, and it is a good price. The case is best case i have ever seen. I love it."
3,Do NOT use the leather strap that comes with the case,"Do NOT use the leather strap that comes with the case, it scratched my brand new 870IS in minutes before I realized it was the metal button on the strap. Canon should be crucified for such design failure."
3,"Good battery, disappointing case","I bought this kit for my SD 870 IS because it was just a few dollars more than the battery alone. Having the extra battery (and the piece-of-mind of having a Canon battery) was worth the cost. The batteries last a surprisingly long time, and one will certainly last long enough to charge another battery.The battery is the end of the value in this package for me. I didn't feel like the SD870 fit in the case very well. So the case has remained in the box. The strap seems rather frivolous. I'd rather have a strap on my camera that I can get a firm hold on.I wish I had bought just the battery instead. The extras aren't worth the few extra dollars."
1,wrong descrption,"When I place my order, the description for this item is ""Cannon Digital Elph Accessory Kit for Cannon SD880IS, SD990IS, SD890IS, SD950IS, SD900, SD870IS & SD850IS Digital Cameras""I bought this accessory kit for my Cannon SD990IS, and found that the case does not fit the camera at all."
3,Serviceable set,"I bought it for the extra battery but the case is nice, although it ONLY holds the camera...no extra pockets for SD cards or the spare battery. The extra long lanyard is nice but I don't think I'll ever use it."
5,Canon leather case + battery kit,You never know when your battery is going to die...and it may happen when you really need it! Furthermore the quality/price ratio is extremely interesting. I'd strongly reccomend to buy this kit.
5,"As always, usually more satisfied with OEM products",I've used the leather oem canon pouches before and they work great. Awesome protection and the battery is oem so I know it should work just as good as the battery that came with the camera.
4,Very satisfied but ...,Very pleased with the metal strap. Exceptional quality and just the right length. Can take pictures without having to remove it from aroundyour neck. Canon battery and not some knock off. Case is of good quality leather and fits like a glove but lacks a pocket for a spare battery and SD-card. If the pockets were added you couldn't do any better.
2,Overpriced,"Not much -- a duplicate wrist strap, spare battery. Leather cover and long strap best part of the packagte."
5,Great product,Great product. Can't believe they include so many items for that priceFast shipping. arrived undamaged and quickly.
4,Good Case; Be Careful of the Magnetic Clasp,"Good sturdy leather case and with the Canon battery is a good value. However, the metal magnetic clasp that holds the flap down has the potential to scratch the camera when inserting or removing the camera from the case. You need to be careful to hold the flap completely back each time you remove the camera. It is manageable, and I have developed a new habit to always hold back the flap to accomodate the clasp. It is workable, but this design wasn't well thought out. Ideally, you would want a magnet that is encased in the leather flap and won't scratch the camera."
4,Best way to buy a new battery,The key item in this kit is the new battery. The others are handy if you need them and come along at little or no increase in price. The case has very stiff walls and so protects the camera nicely. Feeding the camera wrist strap through the case lid as you close it is not difficult (a very minor nuisance). The snap on the lid needs to be held away from the camera as you insert it to avoid scratching the camera. Another very minor nuisance.
3,I should have listened to the other reviews,"I often find that what people write does not match my experience. In this case, I should have listened. The Canon case is hard, square and bulky without room for any accessories. The neck strap is heavy enough to be part of a Mr. T starter kit. I'm won't be using either - I bought this kit for the battery and it was only a few bucks more for the other stuff, so I'm not that upset. I'm using a $4 W-M case by Case Logic that has room for a spare battery, an extra SD card, and a quick-connect neck strap I snagged from one of my jump drives (does anybody really use the neck straps that come with them?). And it's still smaller and less obtrusive in my pocket than the official Canon hard case! As a bonus, unlike the Canon, the W-M belt strap has a snap, so it's easy to put on and take off. If you're really set on the Canon case and/or neck strap, let me know - they're available cheap and unused!"
3,Case could have a pocket,The case is really first class and fits the camera like a glove. My only disappointment is that there is no place to store an extra battery or SD card.
4,Great item,"I needed both the case and the battery charger and it was less getting the set, plus I love the extremely nice neck cord. I will be using this all the time. To me it's much better on a trip than the wrist strap (another wrist comes with this package too). As others have stated, my only complaint is that Canon didn't add just an extra pocket on the case to carry the charger and an extra battery. That would have made it PERFECT. Anyway, this is a very nice item and I have no regrets in the purchase."
1,Don't Buy This Kit if you Have the Canon SD990 IS Camera!,"This Canon case may be great for certain Canon models (it's nicely made)- but the SD990 IS fits so tight there's no way Canon intended this case to fit that specific model. And shame on Amazon and Canon for advertising that the two items work together.As for the long metal-with-plastic neckstrap - it looks like something out of vending machine at a bowling alley - you know, the ones with the mechanical arm that searches thru the junk pile to pick out your your 50 cent ""prize"" and dump it down the chute.At least the battery was the real deal and works fine. That's the only reason I'm not returning this kit; not worth the hassle since the battery goes for $41 and this 3-piece Combo Delight was $49.As for the case and the neckstrap...where did I put that can of lighter fluid?"
2,Cheap leather,"The leather material feels cheap and stiff. It makes the case bigger, which defeats the purpose of having a compact camera and case where you can carry in your pant's pocket. Guest this is ok for the ladies if they put it in their purse. The silver neck strap is too thin. It will probably hurt your neck if you wear for long period of time.I would have returned this product to Adorama Camera, if it wasn't for the trouble of having to pay shipping back.Basically, I did not use the casing and the strap at all. I ended up using my old Canon soft leather case which I bought for my Canon SD400 camera. It fits perfectly."
4,Nice case!,"Nice case, protects the camera well. I would recomend this and the package it comes with. 1 useless thing is the neck strap, but I did not buy this package for the neck strap. If you want a neck strap, get a larger camera bag with a good neck strap. All in all a good purchace."
3,"Nice material and snap, but a bit snug w/ the SD870",Very pleased with the extra battery and the carrying case. Only minor complaint/hassle is that the SD870 feels just a hair too long for the case. You need to work a little to get the snap shut.
3,Canon Digital Elph Accessory Kit,"The camera case is on the small size for my SD870 camera and is seriously missing room for a spare camera battery. The neckstrap is attractive but is ""stiff"" and impractical for general use. I found the wrist strap that comes with the camera more than adequate."
3,Accessory Kit for Canon P&S Camera,"Although it is sort of ugly and thick, the case fits my SD790IS well and it is easy to remove the camera quickly. It is also well padded and should protect the camera just fine, and the whole thing fits fine in my purse. However, I am looking for a second case to hold my extra battery and extra memory cards, it would have been nice to have a little pocket. The extra battery is great to have, and I am glad to have a second real Canon brand battery. The leather wrist and metal neck straps are a little confusing, there is no way to attach them to anything, at least that I can find, so I will not be using them.All in all, a well fitting, protective case and second battery."
4,Good fit for the Canon sd850is,"Good fit for the Canon 850is, but there is no place for an extra battery. I ALWAYS carry an extra charged battery. With the new high capacity sd card memory chips, there is really no need to carry extras with you even a 8 Megs per photo. Fit, finish and quality are nice."
5,GReat case for the Canon 880,"Had this case before and it wore out. Great price for a battery, strap, case. The case does have a magnetic snap instead of velcro which is what they said this one uses but it actually use a snap. It functions well without problems and fits my canon 880 very well."
2,Conon accesory pack,I received this just prior to leaving on a month holiday and the battery was the wrong size for the camera. I will return it when I return home. Camera case is great
4,Great carrying case but,"The carrying case fit the Canon SD900 very well; but wish it has a ring or something to attach the carrying strap. So, you wont leave the carrying case behind."
4,"Accessory Kit is useful, BUT.......","The heavy metal chain that is part of this kit has limited utility. It is a bit too bulky, and a lightweight nylon neckstrap would have been a better choice. However, the case is of excellent quality, and protects my SD900 well. The battery is a needed backup for me in case I need it when I am away from home.Overall, I'd say buying these products as a kit did save me a little money vs. the alternative of buying the three products separately, but the neckstrap somewhat diminishes the bargain I expected."
4,High above average,"So it comes with a cheesy lanyard many of us won't ever wear. Wasteful? Yes, though hardly a reason to complain about the product package because any comparable custom fit case will run for much more. Batteries alone cost more than this whole package. Overall, I'm an above satisfied customer."
2,Case not practical,The case looks good but has no pocket for memory or extra battery. buy the case separately
3,The case needs a small pocket for SD card and battery,"The case is made of high quality leather, but I did not like the leather strap.My biggest complaint with the case is that it does not include a small pocket for an extra SD card and ideally an extra battery.The case I have for my SD400 has a pocket. Having the extra battery always with the camera allowed me to capture several of my best pictures that I would have otherwise missed.I will be looking for a different case."
4,OEM batteries worth the extra money...,This kit is about the same cost as the spare Canon battery by itself - that's what makes it worth the money. The no name batteries that you can buy for $12 or 15 on ebay won't come close to providing the battery life of the OEM Canon battery in pictures per charge or overall longevity. They don't hold a good charge when new and rapidly go downhill from there. The extra money for a genuine Canon battery is well worth it in my experience.
2,Magnetic fastener a downer,"I thought I had read somewhere that this case had a velcro fastener. Alas, it has a magnetic fastener. The case is nice, but there is no room for the extra battery. The neck strap is metal, and looks uncomfortable. Magnetic fasteners are death to credit cards, bus passes, etc. After I ruined a brand new bus pass with the magnetic fastener on a new cell phone case, I swore I'd never have anything else with a magnetic fastener. So this outfit will go back to Amazon."
4,Great product,"This kit is great. Came with the leather case which fit the camera great, extra battery which is always a plus, and the neck strap which is very handy for me and works VERY WELL. The only issue about this was the leather case only fit the camera and nothing else. Wasn't able to hold a extra memory card or battery."
4,Canon Elph Accessory Kit,"Perfect accessory for the Canon camera I also purchased. I wonder why this item would be an 'extra', when for the price, should it not just come with the camera? I am happy with this purchase, with this product."
3,Does it's job,"Works pretty well, although it functions exactly like the cheapo ones floating on Ebay. This one is just higher quality with corresponding price."
4,Great additions,The long strap is just what you need to make taking this gem with you and having it easily available. The second battery is a MUST and a pleasure to have. Case would benefit from a little pocket to keep extra chips in.
3,"camera case does not list 950 as an option, it is very tight. I wonder if it is a mistake that they are selling it for SD950","love the camera cord. case too tight don't like the way the cord fits thru the top, so you have to fiddle with taking it off every time."
2,Carrying case sleek but lacking compartment for spare battery,"This package is fine except that the camera case, though nicely put together in black leather, lacks a compartment to carry a spare battery and/or media card. I consider this a serious deficiency. Had I known this beforehand, I would not have ordered it. It's nice to have the spare battery that is part of this accessory package, and perhaps some day I will use the long neck strap."
3,Bought it for the Battery,"I bought the accessory kit because I needed a case an spare battery. The case is a bit snug for the SD990IS. The camera goes into the case alright, but it's rather tricky to get the camera back out. The case also doesn't have any compartments for extra cards or the extra battery. I ended up tossing this case and buying another one that's a bit bigger, and has pockets. Buying the accessory kit together was cheaper than buying the battery alone, so I think I got a good deal."
3,"battery good, case not so good.","The price is a deal, given that Canon usually gets around $50 just for the battery. I've tried various 3rd party cheapo batteries in different Canon SD models over the years and none of them seem to be any good. The retail Canon batt' is overpriced but at least it holds a charge. As to the case--well, it's genuine leather etc etc but it feels like it's formed out of concrete, way too stiff and not properly lined, not something you'd want to put your shiny new LCD screen up against. No side pockets for the extra batt' or memory cards. However it might make a nice case for keeping your packet of smokes in."
3,Canon SD 870 IS accessory Kit,The protective cover is a bit small (SHORT) for the camera (SD 870 IS)though it is intended for that model. So it take quite a bit of pushing before the button can be closed.The leather of the cover also came scratched.
5,Elph accessory kit review,"Good deal. The leather case is tight, but like most leather items, breaks in after a few uses. Protects the camera well, and prevents it from accidentally turning on. Buying a Canon battery alone is almost the cost of the kit. The neck strap is something I thought I'd never use, but it turns out it's pretty handy. It's a nice metal chain covered in clear rubber, so it doesn't pinch or get your hair tangled in it. Makes the camera easy to grab and take a quick pic. A good buy."
2,Order this Kit only for the extra battery,"I ordered this Accessory Kit when I ordered the Canon Powershot SD850 because I wanted the extra battery. The extra battery is great. The leather case is terrible! The camera fits very tightly into the case. If you put a screen protector on the LCD, it comes off when you pull the camera out of the case. At the time I ordered the camera & kit, Amazon was having a great promotion ($249.73 for the camera & kit) so the kit was basically almost free."
3,nice addition to camera,Case is nice and small. No room for extra battery in it thought. Hand strap is pretty useless. Battery is nice option if you plan for taking a lot of pictures.
4,a bit disappointing,"While there is a lot of information here on the gansta rap scene and its denizens, and while Mr. Haywood has considerable talent, there's a certain flatness to this book that leaves the reader feeling rather empty. The investigation of rapper C.E. Digga Jones's suicide by Haywood's series detective, Aaron Gunner, introduces us to some interesting, very well-developed characters. But the resolution of this story just doesn't have the chilling effect it should, perhaps because of Gunner's somewhat cool, distanced position on what he ultimately learns about the death. The writing is clean and crisp, but Gunner's understated emotions deprive the ending of its punch."
2,"Different view, same old same old","A writer with a different perspective falls into the same old plot devices. Too many cops willing to divulge information at the drop of a hat, a detective too willing to forgive a half naked woman who has just emptied a gun at him. Although witty,a story that carries little mystery or suspense, and too few believable situations."
4,Well worth reading,This was a very good book. The author takes subject matter pulled from recent headlines and gives it a new twist. Aaron Gunner is a welcome mix of brains and brawn but flawed and vulnerable enough to be human.
5,Returning costumer.This product is great.,"I purchased this product for the second time and I can tell you one thing, this is so far the best and only shampoo that does exactly what it says.You just have to use it 3-4 times a week for a month to see the effects.Highly recommended product."
3,Meh,Wasn't any different than Head and Shoulders 2-in-1. A little more watery perhaps. Not like it left me in awe... functional.
5,T-GEL,I was very pleased with this purchase. I received it before the date expected and this is the only shampoo that has been effective in controlling my dandruff!
2,Pretty but fell apart,This is a very pretty watch. I bought it for my daughter and she loved it at first. It keeps time just fine but a piece in the bracelet part was not well made and it fell apart before too long.
5,perfect for purpose,"sturdy, solid, opens and sets up easily. It is used here to hold a plant grow-light stand over tray(s) of seasonal garden seedlings, and is perfect for that purpose."
3,Good Outside Table,"This table is good for outside and inside. Maybe the design is not really beautiful but it can weigh a large TV without breaking and I find really comfortable to have the adjustable high.It doesn't weigh much, you can easily move it around and is easy to transport.I would recommend this table to anyone."
2,Table difficult to use,"Because I am 77 years old and have arthritic hands, I am unable to work the spring mechanism necessary to determine--or adjust--the height of the table. Hence, it is impossible for me to use. I am still trying to return it, trying to disentangle the confusing steps between Amazon and Dazadi (sp?) Sorry. I should know better than to buy something like this sight unseen!"
2,limited use,"In product description above:""Made of heavy-duty polyethylene plastic and steelStronger and more durable than wood, they will not split, chip or peel.""The above points describing this table led me to believe I could use its top to cut stencils or chop cabbage, etc. Such was not the case, although little pressure was applied. This table is usable as a surface to rests things on, preferably indoors."
5,"Love this table, we have three",I love the adjustablility of this table. Each my two children and myself each have a table at a different height for our homeschooling.
4,Product number?,"I don't have one.... ~Will~ probably buy... Looks like best bang for a buck on a small sturdy folding table for my couch. But why doesn't it say anywhere that this is a lifetime model 28241. Don't like the slight off-center leg design at lower heights... or the plastic clip/lock for the legs. (Doesn't look structural, though.) Haven't found a pic that shows how the 80251 legs work, yet... Also, someone noted the table says 40 lbs, not the 200 noted in some specs. Probably not a good idea for a continuous 200 lb load."
5,Personal Table from Amazon,"This table is great for anyone who wants to do crafts, use your laptop computer, playing card and many more uses to numerous to mention. It is very roomy and with the adjustable height makes it comfortable to use. I have two of these tables. I got these at Amazon.com."
5,Great Design and Portability,Easy to store and setup for many things around the house. Doesnt require assembly and durable material. We use it for our laptop whenever we need a quick break and it isn't always bothering because you simply put it away afterwards.
5,Great table,"I first purchased this table for a Sunday School classroom with not much space. The size worked great to keep supplies for an adult class. Then I bought one for a camper to use outside near the water supply from the camper. It folds easily and is easy to store. I've used it to hold portable games, cards, and a writing table while I camp. If I ever have another need for a personal table, this will be the one I choose. I've also recommended it to other campers."
2,not what I was expecting,"Based on the description, I was expecting a table that was collapsible and folded down. This does not fold down like many others in the same line. It does only collapse onto the legs so that it can store flat.... bu then the legs stick out so it becomes even longer when stored."
3,Table is good - Price is not,"The table is nice, sturdy, and folds up nicely for storage and fitting in my car to bring to my gigs. But for $40 I could have gotten two similar tables (larger in size) at WalMart or Target"
1,Horribly small for the money,"this product can barely hold a small sized microwave. no other issues. i got a table double this size for the same rate at walmart, since this was too small and realised that it was no value for money at all!!"
5,This table is really nice,"I'm currently using it as a craft table and it's very sturdy, sturdy enough to hold my older model heavy sewing machine. It was also nice having a side table to use for entertaining by using is for appetizers and dinner. A senior or someone with Arthritis might find it a little difficult to insert the poles in the proper holes depending on what height you want, but mine pretty much stays up so I don't have to do it all the time."
4,Personal Table,I needed a table for my keyboard and mouse as my computer stand has a built in drawer that isn't wide enough for both. This works quite well though isn't as easy to collapse and store as I would have preferred so I tend to just leave it out most of the time.
4,Dent on an edge of table top,"The product came on time, and its quality was good, as I expected. However, there was a small dented area on one edge of the plastic table top. I decided to keep it rather than bothering to sent it back. . . Coincidentally, I had bought a similar table from Home Depot recently in a larger size that also had a dent (I also kept it for the same reason.) It appears that workers are handling the tables in their packaging very roughly in the warehouses. Shame on them."
1,I got a substitute. Insted of lifetime I got a smaller cheaper costco table,I got my order and got a cheaper costco table. Little smaller and doesnt have the nice plastic top. This has a plastic coated wood or something. this was a bait and switch by colonial medical assisted devices. This on is 26 x18 inches. Not 20 x 30 and very thin with a cheap pastic coating.
2,The color is not almond.,I needed to get match a countertop which was almond with brown flexs. I could have paid less and got the white. It looks awful. It is sturdy but very difficult to adjust heights. When folded up the legs stick way out.
3,Not an easy read,"I read this book for a music education class. The book is divided into three sections. The first section describes scenes the author witnessed in various schools; the second section describes one-on-one interviews with children about music; the third section makes recommendations for music teachers based on her ethnographic observations of children. The third section has some compelling ideas in it, and the first two sections support her ideas there. However, if I hadn't been required to read it, I wouldn't have gotten through the first two sections in order to benefit from the third.I agree with an earlier review - check it out from library rather than investing in the book yourself."
3,Library Book,"I enjoyed this discussion of children's natural bent for improvisation. However, this isn't the kind of book you refer back to a lot later on. I would suggest getting it through your local University library.By the way, if you are a University librarian and your school has a music education department, you should definitely get this book!"
3,Very soft support.,"I found these insoles to be somewhat helpful. They are very soft, almost like memory foam. I think I need a more firm support in my shoe. These also need to be in a well-structured shoe, for that reason."
5,Great for diabetic feet,"I use many pairs of these insoles and like them very much. They seem to mold to my foot very well. And they have been very good at preventing blisters. I personally think plastizote insoles are the best for this. I have had multiple foit surgeries and on one foot my foot is permanently defirmed from sarcoing. They have been recommended by my orthopedic doctor.These insoles are not as thick in the heel area as some I have used, which I prefer. Some have so much heel padding, your foot no longer rests properly in the heel pocket of your shoes. These seem to have the right balance of good cushioning, but not excessive. The arch is average, which again I like. In some shoes where there is a substantial built in arch (as with many current sneakers) these fit well. Overall these are my prefered insoles."
3,Very useful,"Bought this for my son to work on his computer. It is great help when soldering electronic boards for computers. The reason for only 3 stars is thow it fits around the head, you can't make smaller to fit the circumference of your head."
4,Insightful and informative,"This book contains a real mix of material, the best of which is fascinating and the worst of which is typical fan writing. For me, the article on ""Evil Dead"" was the most insightful and really made me think differently about the relationship between horror and humour. I would recommend this book to anybody with an educated interest in the subject."
2,"Routine performances, screechy sonics","Despite the Amazon critic's nonsensical notion that Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream sounds better the faster you play it, Paray delivers a sprightly account that is the most pleasing thing on this CD. The Reformation Sym. is brusque and foursquare, delivered in screechy, edgy sound--Mercury Living Presence is a lot more variable than its diehard enthusiasts would lead one to believe. The Haydn is a good, middle-of-the-road reading. In all these works the Detroit Sym. Orch. plays well without being in any way a virtuoso ensemble. All in al, this would be a decent three-star collection if the sound were better."
2,Poorly Organized,"I own perhaps 20 books on the Bird's and this is one of the worse. Mostly because the material is so poorly organized; no real attempt is made to sort through the (admittedly tangled) move orders/motifs/variations in this opening. Also, the author seems to have a 'bad attitude' even though he plays the opening and has several examples in the book. The section on the Leningrad Dutch-Reversed is better than the others but still lifeless.The entire Everyman opening series has deteriorated a great deal the past two years and I'm about done buying any new ones, especially if they are as bad as Bird's Opening."
2,"Slow, can't read discs playable in a $50 cheap unit","I bought this unit to replace one of Sony's first DVD players, old enough to have a DIVX phone jack. I wanted to consolidate the VCR space and get something that would load discs faster; one out of two ain't bad. This thing loads discs slower than a 5-6-year-old Sony DVD player, slower than a 'cheaper' brand competitor, and can't play many discs that other units & computers can. I still love my Bravia LCD, but the next media player that gets plugged into it sure isn't gonna be a Sony."
2,Very frustrating.,"This product seemed to be a very good for us feature wise. But, basic usage of this item can be very frustrating. Here are a few reasons:1) Loading of CD's and DVD's seems to take forever.2) Hitting 'next' button had very long lag between starting to go to the next item, and it getting to the next item.3) The VHS player has tracking issues with many tapes (even new ones out of the box). Making viewing impossible.4) Hitting eject, and many other buttons, seem to have a huge lag between hitting the button-- and it doing anything. Hit 'eject' or 'play' and it might be a minute before the player acknowledges you hit a button. This is a different issue than item 2 above.5) The remote in not intuitive. And in the menu, often what the menu items are don't map to the remote buttons.6) Often rewind of a VHS tape literally goes at the same speed as playing the tape. Meaning that the speed at which it rewinds is normal play rate.I simply cannot believe this is actually a Sony product."
1,VCR-only for the price of DVD-VCR combo,DVD stopped working immediately after warranty expired (freezes within 30 seconds).
3,SLOW RESPONSE TO COMMANDS,"I bought the Sony SLVD360P DVD/VCR primarily because I have several Sony TVs and other products with which I have been very pleased. This DVD/VCR combo does a good job in most respects and my main complaint is that commencement of action after commands are given is slow, i.e. it takes several seconds for the ejection sequence to begin after the eject button is pressed. In fast forward-mode on the tape, the transition to PLAY is jerky and slow. Sound and picture quality are excellent"
2,It is what it is...,"I bought this for our church, as a companion to a new video projector. It's ok, but the VCR is pretty sad: it has a hard time with some older tapes that play just fine in a $40 no-name VCR. The DVD player does a decent enough job, but it's nothing special.One really stupid thing, mentioned in another review, is that the VCR and DVD sections don't share the S-Video output, so I have to run two separate connections to the TV. Dumb. Isn't that why you buy a combo deck in the first place? To eliminate extra wires?Given the chance to do it over, I would buy separate components."
1,Died after 8 months,"Worked OK until it suddenly died after only 8 months of moderate use. Sony warranty covers parts for a year, but labor for only 90 days. They offered to swap with a refurb for $33 plus the cost of shipping the dead unit to them. Prior to its demise, I would have rated it acceptable. DVD is very slow to load, especially music CDs and VCDs."
2,Not satisfied,"After about a month's use, this unit just suddenly loses power. This can occur during playback, or even when not in use. I have to unplug it, then wait a while, then plug it back in, and then it will flash ""AUTO"" and it works againg for a while (so far). This is a recurring problem - if anyone knows what causes this, I would appreciate any possible clues."
3,Lots of Fun and Great to Look At,"This film is nothing heavy, but lots of fun. The art direction is wonderful, creating a stylish and romanticized vision of the 1930s. The cast of this screwball comedy of errors and mistaken identity is terrific. I always love watching Tom Wilkinson."
1,WILL NOT PLY,"WAITED FOR OVER A MONTH FOR THE DVD TO COME FROM ENGLAND, AND IT WILL NOT PLAY,IT IS FOR THE WRONG REGION, I HAVE E MAILED THE VENDOR, WILL WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS"
4,Piccadilly Jim,"Very fond of anything P.G.Wodehouse. just lots of fun, mindless humor. Complicated plots that always end with the inevitable happy ending, love triumphs."
3,"Odd, silly, not faithful to Wodehouse - but with great cast & fun to watch!","The reason I wanted to see this film is because it stars one of my favorite quirky actors, Sam Rockwell. But the movie is hard to find (just notice its lack of affordable availability even on Amazon). I finally caught it on cable on demand. Since I was mainly watching it for the cast - which is a wonderful mix of excellent British and American stars - I was not as critical as some reviewers of the faithfulness of adaptation. But I can understand the chagrin of Wodehouse fans; it's terrible as far as story adaptation (should basically be labeled ""loosely based on"") and pretty fuddled as far as the historical period in which it supposedly takes place. That being said, it's a silly and fun romp, like THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST meets BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, with odd characters, ridiculous situations, and melodramatic scenes. I found it distracting entertainment for a lazy weekend."
4,"Teachnology, Literacy and Learning: A multimodal Approach",This is a good book. I found it easy to understand and it covers aspects of multimodal from different perspectives.
3,"Good book, not for beginners","I have to agree with an earlier reviewer that indicated that this is not for beginners. I have 2 years of experience with video editing (Final Cut) and Photoshop CS/CS2, and the knowledge that using those tools gave me prepared me to use this book. I'm not sure that ideas such as layers, timelines, compositions, effects, etc. would have made sense to me without that prior knowledge.That being said, this is a great book. I've made it to chapter 9 so far and am enjoying learning and looking forward to using these techniques with my video productions."
4,This book is great. Even better when it is used in a classroom.,"Learning After Effects on your own is like trying to get around in a foreign country on your own. It helps a great deal to learn the basics of using the interface and getting a better understanding of using a motion design program.Since the new 7 version is different than the previous 6/6.5, it makes an easier transition for those who have to upgrade.The only drawback of course are the examples which though helpful for learning, wouldn't work in a portfolio.Overall, it is well the worth the price of the book to learn everything you would learn from an expert in person.However, having access to a professional or two wouldn't hurt either. In fact, if you are serious, it is a MUST."
3,Good Starting Point,"The Fantasy Encyclopedia offers a brief history and colorful illustrations of hundreds of mythical creatures. From Fairies to Goblins, and Mermaids to Manticores, this encyclopedia is definitely informative with names and origins of the featured creatures, but it offers little else in way of description. It is an encyclopedia for young readers so I feel getting too descriptive would have been a negative aspect in this particular book. Given the author's chosen audience, I would say this book is a great starting point for young readers to begin learning about the supernatural world."
3,Good artwork but it isn't worth the money.,"This book is okay, but there could have been a little more information in it on (the pictures are huge and take up most of the page space). That being said, the artwork is great, but it doesn't compare to books like the Spiderwick Field Guide and Dragonology. If you're looking for something a little more complete, and something that is worth 25 dollars, don't buy this book."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Presumably this is aimed at children as a brief overview. Mostly a waste of time for anyone that knows anything about the topic, other than as a quick browse, or a chance to pick up a different creature, beastie, or monster. So this is much more in the vein of a picture book for kids, as far as I can tell."
5,Great.,"Very efficient and so QUIET. We had another brand of ionizer many years ago, and had forgotten how well these little fellas work, on smells and on knocking down dust as well."
4,Does its job perfectly.,"Bought it to get rid of cooking smell, and it has been working great. We leave it on at night, and by morning, its all gone, smells fresh. The only lil complaint i have is, just around the purifier itself, there is a weird smell, more metallic/filter/new product like smell, that was very strong the first day, it has however started to subside now..overall a good value for money! My friends referred this to us, and now she bought one too, because I couldnt stop raving about it :)."
3,not helpful or realistic,"I bought this book looking for something to help children explore the emotion of anger, and hopefully open up a realistic dialogue to include problem-solving for angry situations. This book's plot is fantasy-based, and offers no jump off point for a realistic dialogue with children. Also, since anger is sometimes a scary feeling for very young children, I did not like that Arthur's anger actually caused his world to explode. This is not very reassuring to children looking for mastery over their emotions."
2,scratched the surface,"This essay was lengthy and filled with some nice words, but analysis wise it barely scratched the surface. There were lots of typos and I wouldn't recommend it as a secondary source."
3,"Great song, but...","For anyone who has ever heard M.I.A., they know that she is brilliant and her music is probably some of the most infectious stuff out there. ""Sunshowers"" is no exception, with its great beat, stunning lyrics and catchy chorus. But truth be told, this maxi sinlge has nothing to purchase it for. It has Sunshowers, Fire Fire, which are on her album, and the instrumental and acapella of the song, which aren't too exciting, they sound best when put together. There aren't any remixes, so if you already have the album, there's really no point of buying it unless if you're a die hard fan. But the maxi single comes in a digipak with some of her great artwork, so it's cool."
5,great soup,"Lipton Noodle Soup, Extra Noodle, 4.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)It came in a timely fashion,my daughter just love's it.It's quick to make and has very good flavor,just the thing when your studying."
3,too salty,"i tried making it watery, tried adding spices, there is no way around it, it's just really salty, wish i could give it a better review, it tastes good, just the saltiness is too overpowering."
1,Nutritional Misdirection,"Each packet of this soup is NOT single serving size!...and the packaging does very little to correct that misperception: the soup is shown in a coffee mug-sized scenario. You're supposed to add 4 cups of water to each packet; which is more soup than anyone is looking for at lunchtime. Even when you add all that water to the mix, I hope you're on a starvation diet, because the serving size on the box is 2 tablespoons!!!! TWO TABLESPOONS! What are you supposed to do with 4 cups of chicken soup (with a stray micro-noodle floating by now and then) when your alloted portion is two tablespoons? You're supposed to forget that consuming a reasonable amount of soup fills you with 100 percent (if not more) of your daily sodium intake.This is an absurd product."
4,Fast and easy for a quick lunch.,Do not follow the instructions on the package. I put one package in a resealable bowl and roughly measure 3 tablespoons into a cup of cold water and nuke it for 1 min 40 seconds. Depending on your microwave it may take a couple of tries to get it right for you. Then let it sit for a bit and nuke for a little while longer until it boils. The noodles are very soft and the broth is tasty. I liked it so much I shared some with a friend.
5,Puyana Scintillates,"Born in Bogota, Colombia, Raphael Puyana has been a major player in the world of harpsichords for a long time now. He was a student of Wanda Landowska, and his crisp, scintillating performances really grab the ear.I tried to get this particular recording from another website and they were unable to get a copy for me. Then I tried Amazon, and they got it to me right away. And to think I might have missed out hearing these brilliant renditions of Bach if I had not tried to find it here."
2,"A feeble shadow of his first book ~{!0~}notes to myself""","I was really disappointed with this book. His previous book ~{!0~}notes to myself~{!1~} was really beautiful, simple, authentic and felt very true to me (see my review). So I hurried to buy the book ~{!0~}spiritual notes to myself~{!1~}, and expected it to be the same, but instead, I found just the opposite. This book sounds more like preaching, or like lip service. I got the sense that these thoughts didn~{!/~}t flow directly from his heart, like in the first book, but instead, they were chewed, repaired and mended to fit a presupposed ideal about altruism, love and relationships. There are many other books that cover these aspects more authentically than this one."
4,Music That Sings Honestly from the Heart,"Pianist Vassilis Tsabropoulos found himself fascinated by the music attributed to the mystic Gurdjieff, whose music was originally set by pianist/disciple Thomas de Hartmann in the 1920s. Keith Jarrett made a recording of some music attributed to Gurdjieff some years back for ECM, and now we have this new recording of music by Gurdjieff and music in the same style composed by Tsabropoulos, arranged this time for piano and cello.There is nothing difficult or profound in this music, which is quite easy on the ear, but it is music that can be enjoyed over and over again. Don't worry, though, this is not saccharine music, this is music that sings honestly from the heart, and the two players put an abundance of heart into their performance. For those who would like to hear something a bit off the beaten path that is not overly challenging, I recommend this recording quite highly."
4,Makes you feel like you are really in New Orleans !!,"Part 1 was ""Sinatra-like"" songs - very good. Part 2 was just as though you were in New Orleans whooping it up!!! Don't know where he gets all that energy (and his orchestra)."
4,Still Wishing,"I continue to purchase Connick material expecting to get those great big band charts. I must admit that I don't ""get"" Harry's piano ideas and that is a low on every purchase. I still come back because there is always some real highs listening to the band and some quality soloists."
2,Can be more crispy.,I bought the DVD to see if my children can learn basic words in telugu. I found that if was not crispy. The idea is great but I wish it can be redone to make it more interesting as it is intended to teach little children. My children could not watch the whole DVD even once. The idea is good but need to be more interesting.
3,Telugu languages resources are hard to find,"It's so hard to find any Telugu learning resources, so I purchased Exploring Telugu for my little girl to get some exposure to her daddy's ""mother tongue"". This product would be better if there were more sections to the DVD. The menu page gives an impression that there could be multiple sections of learning, but only has one. The entire video is about 30 minutes, so it's a little pricey for such a short amount of time available on the DVD. According to my husband, a couple of the words are ""old style"" Telugu which isn't used much anymore, but the rest of the content was ok. If you're like me and have no knowledge of the Telugu language but want your children (or even you) to pick up a few basic words, then this is ok."
3,"Entertainment for infants, not really educational","I'm a second generation Telugu Indian (my parents moved to the US from Andhra) and I received this DVD as a gift at my baby shower.This DVD would not be an effective tool to actually teach a toddler or child how to speak Telugu. As a previous reviewer noted, some of the words they describe are very long or irrelevent (ie- not actually used in India anymore!). This is becuase they use the same video as for the Hindi version (and the Hindi words are short and used, so they were relevant for that video), and then just dubbed it into Telugu.But, it keeps an infant entertained, like Baby Einstein. And I like the idea that my son can see brown people, just like himself, on TV."
1,This is simply a re-issue of _Invisible Republic_,"Now that the editorial review is up, you will not make the mistake that I did when all I had to go on was the title. The only difference that I can see: a two-page preface that tells us why the book is being reissued under another title. Since I ordered a new copy of _Invisible Republic_ at the very same time I ordered this book, I am (having fetched it from the post office five minutes ago) more than a little miffed."
1,Greil Marcus Should Marry Bob Dylan,"Greil Marcus Should Marry Bob Dylan...he's already written a long love-letter. True there are a lot of interesting musical relationships brought out in the author's discussion, but the details of the Basement Tapes are just not there. Marcus' approach is that of an ethno-musicologist, and one who is too close to his subject. Personally, the bias from the start of the book and the torturous prose were very hard to stomach. I can not recommend this book to anyone, and it will keep me away from anything else by Greil Marcus again. I only wish I could have been warned before I bought it."
1,Cheap,"low quality doesn't look like leather looks more like plastic not what it looks like in image ,very thin not worth your money. also could no get a refund once order was placed."
4,Can't Appreciate w/o First Seeing Kenshin TV+Trust/Betrayal,"The feature runs about an hour long, and some of it is even rehashed stuff from the Kenshin TV series. The action sequences are very short, and lacking the fury of Trust/Betrayal. Thankfully, the same animation team worked on this production. Save this for the very end, it concludes the story of Rurouni Kenshin, much more effectively than episode 95 of the TV show. Overall, it was a bit on the boring side, but necessary, as this story needs to be told. Some very dramatic moments though, when Kenshin confronts Enishi.ADV is known for very poor DVD extras. Their idea of extras are previews of other DVDs they put out. With Seisouhen, they did a decent job: the original Japanese voice actor interviews are fairly interesting, and help to put a face on the work."
4,Kenshin's OVA,"This OVA happens to take place in the future after Kaoru and Kenshin are married and have a son named Kenji, ...but this OVA is also tied together with clips of Kenshin's bloody past! It actually makes a nice twist, and is somewhat fun to compare the characters and animation to Rurouni Kenshin! The animation to Samurai X is so much more realistic and is somewhat similar to Ghost in the Shell animation, where as Rurouni Kenshin's animation is more anime like, and more humerous! Overall this OVA isn't bad, and is worth purchasing if your interested!"
1,This was OK at best.,"I've seen the import version of this and after i saw it I wondered why i watched it in the first place. This ova made it a point to change things that happned in the series and make it seem that Kenshin didn't undergo the character changes in the Kyoto arc. Plus the first DVD is a recap of the series and they changed many of the scenes to make Kenshin seem more sad. Also unlike the manga this is mos certainly NOT a happy ending. I loved kenshin and liked how it was light hearted and this is not a suitable ending, why change the ending from what it was in the manga when the series pretty much follows it?"
2,Long and Boring...,"I'm a huge Kenshin fan, but this movie was boring and sad. I felt depressed after watching it. It shows Kenshin as a sick elderly man. The only parts I enjoyed were the brief flashbacks to when he was young. Also, as a warning, the artwork is very different from Samuri X and the television series, not bad, but just a different style. I think die-hard fans will enjoy the movie so I won't discourage anyone from watching it, but just know what to expect before hand."
4,Why did it have to end?,"This, the animated ending of Rurouni Kenshin, affected me for days. It is beautiful and extremely tragic. The animation is done not in the style of the series, but of the first OAVs, which seemed fitting to me because of the serious tone of the storyline. I could really feel all of Kenshin and Kaoru's emotions in this DVD, not to mention Kenji's anger. It does a nice job of summarizing the Jinchuu Arc, which was *VERY UNFORTUNATELY* never animated outside of the manga. That is my only complaint. It would have been so wonderful to have that story animated fully instead of being squeezed into this DVD. It is too short. Overall, however, if you love Rurouni Kenshin it is only fitting to watch it through to the end. If you love a tear-jerker, I strongly recommend this one."
1,Pathetic!!!!!!!,"I've seen Samurai X-Reflection on the net and i gotta say, it is pathetic as the title says. Imma big Ruruoni kenshin fan and i can't believe the OVA strayed away from the Anime.. Wut happened to Kenshin?? all of a sudden he looks weak and lacking of confidence.. he's not the same Kenshin Himura i used to know..i prefer the original anime designs from the series, i liked it better...i hated the ending, kenshin dying..no way.. i was pissseddd off cuz of dat...the ending in the anime series was 100x better than this...i encourage everyone who hasn't seen it to forget about it and not to recognize it as part fo the Kenshin saga...i officially denounce it and will pretend dat it was never made..."
5,CLOSURE,"The real ending of the best anime series. I know that this movie was sad, but it has to be. It takes a good movie to make you cry. The entire flim was great. The story, fight scenes, and music were terific!A true ending to a timeless anime I will never forget."
1,Watsuki!! What have you done?!?,"Okay, to begin with, i haven't purchased this part yet. But i've read enough to know how bad this is. i've seen the OVAs and the series. Nobuhiro Watsuki, i hope you see this. You're an awesome guy, but why did you let some goof take over the series and end this wonderful story just like that? The OVAs were good, no complaints. The motion picture was quite a bit boring, but it's ok. But the stuff after the Kyoto Arc in the series, sheesh!! They're awful!! Things don't connect. It's like a whole new story. A crappy one! I even taped the DVDs of the episodes after the Kyoto Arc to the casing and wrote ""Do not view."" Now this? Kenshin dying of some stupid disease? He deserves more than that. Watsuki should've taken care of that part and left us an open ending. Please think of this Watsuki, are you there?!?!? If at all possible, pull the stuff after the Kyoto Arc and the Reflection movie out of the market and remake them. Please!"
2,BORING,"through out this whole movie i thought it was good but when i bought it and came home and watch it, it wasnt that good of all the whole movie was like a sop opera all it talks about is how karou is wait for kenshin to come back but the whole story is from karou past and like what happen and so on i thought that this was goin to be like Samurai X trust and betrayel but its totally differnt"
3,"Good, But Kenshin? I think not.","A nice anime overall, but most definately NOT Rurouni Kenshin. It was depressing to the point it made the previous OVAs look like care bears, and was mostly a recap of previous things. Truthfully, the main reason I liked it was because it revealed Kenshin and Kaoru got married. Even if Kenshin was dying of a disease? and fought in another war? I think?"
2,An unworthy attempt to emulate the success of the first OVAS,"There's too many problems with this OVA, if you are not a Rurouni Kenshin fan I recommend you only rent this. To clearly understand the story you must have seen at least up to the end of the Kyoto Arc in the TV series and also the first OVAS(""Trust"",and also ""Betrayal""). Its is also strongly recommended you read the entire last arc from the manga the Revenge Arc(2000 pages). You'll see many incredible events that were not told in this OVA which foolishly tried to condense the Arc in 15 minutes. As for the new stuff not based on the manga, yahiko's and kenji's relationship seems acceptable but not the fact kenji is training with Hiko. As for ending it is a pathetic attempt to copy the sorrow of the first OVAs, the director took too many liberties with the story. He should have tried to explain the events of the beautiful Revenge Arc instead..."
2,Severe Disappointment,"Let me start by saying I love the Rurouni Kenshin series. Without a doubt my favorite anime series. So let me start with the good bits. I liked the bits with Kenshin's son. He seems to refuse to listen to everyone else and, without intervention, seems poised to repeat his father's mistakes. Also, the animation, while much different than anything related to it, is quite good, once you get used to the switch.Now, the bad. The voices for the characters seemed particularly poorly chosen, and the dubbing at times went from bad to awful. Worst of all, though, is that this movie is, by my estimation, 70% flashback and 30% new story. When I rented this movie, it wasn't to watch cherished scenes from my favorite series made into an embarrassing mockery."
1,It's horrible,I am a big fan of the first 3 Samurai X DVD's and was completely disappointed at this one. I don't even want to watch the series anymore because of this. The plot was horrible and boring and the ending is just not satisfying to true fans of Kenshin. He wound up all weak and stupid. Totally disappointing and I do not recommend buying it as it'll ruin the entire series for you.
4,"Depressing, but good.","The second OVA is haunting and depressing, an unexpected end to the whole series. There are very dark tones, and they take the hint from the end of the manga that Kenji hates his father. But the plot is realistic. Kenshin, no matter what, would still go on to try and protect Japan, even to the extent of leaving his family. Bautiful brotherly moments between Sano and Kenshin, as he persuades him to go back to Japan for Kaoru's sake.The animation is of the same calibre as the first OVA, and the Background music as good. I recommend this if you want a good cry. But beware - You must watch this at the very end of the whole series.P.S: Did anyone realise that the girl with Kenji that was seen at the end of the series, is the same girl that appeared in Volue one manga of Rurouni Kenshin? At the end of that volume, there is a little bonus story. Her name and design is unchanged - Chitsuru. Lol, I wonder why they re-used that character."
2,A horrible end to the Kenshin OVA,"This DVD could have been great if not for the absolutly piontless and stupid ending... Please if you are a die hard fan DO NOT buy this the ending makes absloutly NO sense what so ever it left me feeling empty and angry. The betrayal of Kaoru was pathetic and weak, and Kenshin seemed almost senile, as if his family friends and son we no existant or didn't matter. Megumi, Sanosuke, and Yahiko were the only ""normal characters"" meaning only they stuck to their real nature. The best thing this has to offer is all the episodes leading up to the end so if you really must see the movie then please PLEASE skip the ending! All this movie really is is the reflection of what happend to Tomoe, kenshin fighting with her brother, and then the screwed over ending where kenshin and kaoru end up together."
5,this is perfect,"THIs is pure perfection and anybody with a narrowminded opinion that it isn't the true ending,its bad,or anything else negative thats been said about this.they can DIE!!!! WITH THEIR DUMB OPINIONS!!!"
5,Great movie :),"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loved it! He had a difficult time looking for it in stores, luckily I found it here."
2,fly away,"hard to see in the garden light, these are not very durable and look more like bugs than butterflies"
2,Nothing important,"You can read this book if you like, but I wouldn't recommend it. I think that the series should have ended with 2010, because it had the perfect open-ended way of finishing the series, and everything that had to be explained was explained but also something was left for the imagination of the readers. As a stand alone book, 2061 really isn't that bad, but as a part of the Odyssey series there is nothing really in it."
3,Not great at all,"2061 is nowhere near as good as 2010. I think that the story was fairly good, and of course I think that ACC is a great author, but really we still don't see much of why the monolith is what it is, and we just continue the adventures of Dr. Floyd, and now his Grandson. The first few chapters in book deal with a landing on Haley's comet which I am sure was probably real fascinating back in 1986, but here in the year 2000 it really is just his shot at current events like always. Speaking of which it never ceases to amaze me how many times ACC brings up either current events, or events not that long ago, that I am sure no one will even remember let alone care about in the future. If you read 2001 and 2010, I say, either read 3001 and just end the story now, or just stop, because there are really few surprises left the rest of the way."
3,Worth the Read,This was an entertaining sequel to 2010 but it is not as good a story as the first two books. I think that the primary reason for this is that there is not as large a problem as there was in 2001 and 2010. Even the challenge that the characters do face does not seem all that bad and the reader gets the impression that everything will be alright in the end. Without a really compelling plot the book really seems like filler to give the reader an update on what is happening on Europa. All in all it was an entertaining book ( I especially like the fact that characters from the previous stories were used) but it is the most forgettable of the first three books.
4,good sequel to 2010,"if you are a fan of 2001 and 2010 then you will like this book. very good story, could have been better. i did enjoy it since i am a fan of 2001 and 2010. seems to be more of a direct sequel to 2010 then 2010 was to 2001. fast paced book keeps you reading!"
3,"In my opinion, Clarke could have done better.","This book was too mediocre to be associated with the genius of the two previous works, 2001 and 2010"
1,this book is really bad,"I was thoroughly dissappointed by this book. This is one of those books where you keep reading it because you think any minute somehting might happen but let me save you some trouble. Nothing ever happens. OK Ill give away the whole climax. They find a huge diamond the size of a mountain on europa!I read the last few pages of this book on a bus and when I was done I just threw the damn book out of the window for the next sucker. Did I mention this book is bad? Arthur C Clarke usually has a mystical visionary element in his books. I think when he wrote this book he just wanted some extra cash or something because its very shallow unlke say, Childhood's End."
4,Still doing well...,"Although not as good as 2001 and 2010, this book is still a worthy sequel. I agree that the last few pages is all you need to understand the book, but it's still a good sci-fi book, with many interesting parts like the landing on the comet, or on Europa. It is also interesting to see what is happening on Europa. All in all it's a good book, and it's best to accept this one as the ending of the Odyssey series, because 3001 is a disaster..."
3,Very slow,"I think there was no need to draw out the plot of the book as he did. If I were the author I would have compressed the whole Galaxy getting stranded on Europa thing into one or two sections, rather than going on about it for the whole book, and I would have concentrated more on what Hal, Bowman, and Heywood did for the interim until Lucifer expired. If you just want the basic plot, read the last section of the book and you'll understand."
3,No Ending,"I did enjoy this book. I loved how A.C.C decribed the surroundings.But there was one problem with the book, it did't have an ending. It just stopped at the juicest part and sort of bugs me. So I would say not to read this book, it's too disapointing.;"
4,"A decent sequel, though not as good as 2001 and 2010","Admittedly, I may have been influenced by 2001 and 2010 in grading this book with an 8 (maybe it doesn't really deserve it). However, it is quite a pleasant book to read. It doesn't add much to the story; the book it is more of a tour around Lucifer and its moons. ACC has amply sprinkled most of the book (and especially the begining) with chapters apparently irrelevant to the main story, but I found them quite pleasing and sometimes interesting to read. These digressions concern the economical, political and scientific development of the world (or should I say solar system?) in 2061.Though I wouldn't recommend it as strongly as the previous two books, if you've read 2001 and 2010, what the heck, get this one too..."
4,The Odyssey continues.,"This novel, although a sequel, and a cashing in on the previous works, is still a fairly good staory.Not a novel, because there is nothing novel about it, it simply continues the esxisting story, almost like a soap opera.If you liked 2001 and 2010, you will probably like this one also."
4,very good,I believe that this book will be one of hisbest but feel that the last few chapterswere a little confusing as to when the time line took place. There was to much of a gap
3,Bland follow on to earlier brilliance!,"This book tries to string out the story from the earlier books. It's over long, and not very exciting.Read 2001 and 2010, and watch the excellent films, but avoid this book.Sorry ACC it's just not good enough."
4,this was a good sequi,"I was partially disappointed at this book. The first two odysseys where far better than this. The good side of it was you get to meet Dave again or whatever he has become. This is an intriging book. The only thing that disapointed me was the ending, But now with the release of 3001 I think it will be a lot better and it will close the ending"
2,did i miss something?,"my book must have had half of the pages torn out or something, because there was barely any kind of description of anything in it. I have to be honest when i talk about 2061. I am a great fan of 2001 and 2010, but i must say this book really stinks. My book had LOTS of typos and grammer problems in it, and absoutely no description of anything important. I didn't learn a single thing about the space baby in this one. I feel like i could have read the last 5 pages of the book and understood the entire thing."
1,Pretty lame,"I found several problems with this book. First, what was the whole point of the comet sequence in the beginning? It passed itself as information, rather than actually lending itself to the story. Second, nothing really ever happens, they get to the planet's moon and find a new life form, and...that's it! Finally, one of the most important and entertaining characters of the series, HAL, where is he? Oh, he makes a cameo appearance in the last three pages. Now I have heard that 3001 is out. Please Clarke, make it stop"
1,A Climax Wanting,"This entire story is a waste of time. Fortunately for a novel it is short, so you don't waste too much time one it. The story has minor (but somewhat predictable) plot twists that culminate in two paths merging. The real downfall for this book, however, is that Clarke sets you up for a climatic rescue attempt that is scarcely mentioned once you get there. Literally, what should have been the climax of the story is dealt with within 3 sentences. Before I knew it, all the characters were safe and on their way home without any disasters/ narrow misses/ or complications that would have made for a REAL story."
3,What's on Europa?,"I resisted reading this book for a while based on the overwhelming negative reviews but it deffinately is a worthy sequel to the odyssey series. As usual Clarke uses lots of science fact to paint a possible fictional story as to the next step in how Europa fits into earth's future.In the book, humans have stayed away from Europa as per the last message sent from Discovery by Bowman or the ETs who made him. But something has appeared on the ""night side"" of the planet and someone hijacks a ship forcing it to land on Europa.Why would someone want to land on Europa after the warning? Will there be any consequences for landing? What do they find on Europa? What life? Does the hijacker find what they were looking for on the surface of Europa?Read and find out!"
4,"Good, Not Great","This book is not at all bad, but it pales in comparison to the two great novels (two of the best of all-time) that preceded it. It is a fairly interesting book, but does little to advance the Odyssey series. Actually, the best part of the book is the first half, where a landing is made on Haley's Comet. Sure, it has nothing to do with the rest of the book (or the series, for that matter), but it is undeniably cool. It almost makes you wish that Clarke has extended it to a different novel of it's own, outside the Odyssey series. About the only interesting development in this book as far as the series is concerned is that Heywood Floyd joins (or appears to join) Bowman and Hal in the monolith. However, this fact is contradicted in 3001, so one could actually read 2001 and 2010 and skip over this book to 3001 and lose nothing as far as continuity was concerned. If indeed, one felt the need to do that.Read this is you are a fan of the series, but don't start here."
3,A weak link,"This was a great story. It just seemed like it was only loosely related to the rest of the Odyssey series. All the main players are there (Heywood Floyd, Dave Bowman and Hal) but this seems more like a standalone story about a space rescue with a little bit of the Odyssey mythos sprinkled in as an afterthought."
3,"Well written in parts, but would have passed reading this","Although very well-written in parts, I found myself lost in this book and caught in a trap of technical mumbo jumbo. I still am not sure what happened in this book or what it is about. It is hard to write in such technical terms and Clarke makes an honorable attempt, but it just seems to lack any vitality overall."
3,"fun, but quality decays...","Typical of Clarke, he begins a series with a powerhouse, but the quality of the series decays over time. This is a fun read if you've read the prior two, and the period of time spent on an asteroid (!) makes for good sci-fi.However, this is tripe compared to 2001, and by all means stop at this book. Whatever you do, don't read 3001 - it will just make you cry. Some authors need to learn how to quit while they're ahead."
3,Not a Great One for Clarke,"Definitely 2061 was a little disappointing. We have an aged Heywood Floyd landing on Haley's Comet, then trekking through the solar system just to save some stranded passengers from a downed spaceship. He goes off on a couple tangents definitely, and I don't think it was necessary to have the plot with the diamonds and South Africa.Not a worthy successor to 2001 and 2010. The characters from 2010 are long since gone and the new characters are disappointing in their presentation."
3,Good but not quite there,"This book was okay for a read as it was lite and entertaining but not up to par for ACClarke. The tale takes us fifty years past the last encounter with Floyd and in his final voyage more bizarre things start to happen, with the Monolith at the center of the trouble. Read if you want to find out how the story progresses past the last episode and if you like a lite sci fi journey. But otherwise I don't really recommend it."
3,It's OK,"This book is best read on its own merits and not as a continuation of the 2001 series. It has a fun little trip through Haley's comet, an interesting idea about what is at the center of Jupiter, and what should be done with it. However great an author Clarke is, there are many concepts which he plainly doesn't grasp - human nature, religion, and pop culture. His contention that the Beatles will be completely forgotten in a mere sixty years reveals him to be hopelessly square. It's not his fault, a man's just got to know his limitations."
3,Nothing special.,This book wasn't anything special. Personally I didn't see its purpose. Its plot was meaningless. We had to read an entire book just to understand that the monolith is only a tool. I didn't see why Clarke wrote this.
2,"Poor version of Delany's ""Nova.""","I keep waiting for Clarke to produce works of originality and substance, but this one was, unfortunately, a bad attempt at what Delaney did much better in ""Nova.""Though I respect Clarke tremendously, this was not his best work."
3,"Weak, but forgivable","This book is pretty good but a bit weak and confusing. I also read 3001, and ACC has redeemed himself over this one. This book is great, far greater than I could ever have done, but not as good as his other three books"
2,Clarke cashing in on his reputation.,"How sad to see an author of such stature losing his marbles publically, and cashing in his rep.Still, a better book than ""Ender's Game"" or ""The Diamond Age"". Almost anything is."
1,"Waste of time - read his ""Rendezvous With Rama""","Rendezvous With Rama was written in 1972, when he had some writing skills still. Skip this empty fluff and go with the 1st Rama book - it's 5 stars."
3,Typical downward spiral from Clarke,"This series is SOOOO typical of Clarke. He astounds us with a mind-blowing idea then, because of his inability to develop characters with which we can identify, he must rely on the original story or variations thereof. The same thing happens here.2001 was a masterpiece of writing (and a cinematic jewel to boot). Then came the almost as good 2010. No novel characters were added, though, and we are stuck with the original plot only it's fifty years later. This might have been a good story if it had not tried to be a sequel...the story of the flight to the comet, the message from Dave, the rescue - these are all good in themselves IF - and this is a big if - there are interesting characters. There aren't and it fails in this respect."
2,"Boring, Especially If You Made It This Far","I loved the first one, liked the second and really thought this one would finally get to answering the questions floating around after the first two books, not so. With a little mystery surrounding the actual fate of HAL and Dave Bowman raised towards the end of the book there appears to be little else from this book that actually contributes to this universe. I thought this book was disappointing."
3,"2061 starts off okay, but...","I love the series of stories about the monolith, and I began the story with excitement, but in the end I felt unfulfilled. At the beginning, I thought, ""How cool, landing on Halley's Comet. How cool seeing some of the steps to figure out what Mt. Zeus is.""(Beware: Spoiler here...) This is a story that is ultimately about a rescue mission to Europa, but at the end of the book, he doesn't even talk about the actual rescue! He skips to Ganymede base, after the crew of Galaxy is rescued. Clarke was a great writer, and you can see it in the prose, but he lets you down at the end.His discussion in the final chapter about the place of Europa and the monolith is clarifying."
2,Wow! What a lousy book!,"This book is pretty bad. Halfway through, all I could think about is hurrying up and getting the torture over with so I could start 3001. In retrospect, this one book isn't even essential to the overall storyline - it's barely related. The book is basically a thought experiment for ""I wonder how mankind could land on a comet someday? Hmm, I think it would go like this...."" Clarke has an insufferable tendency to create a conflict in his stories and solve the issue immediately. All the corny dialogue doesn't help either. Honestly, I have read better stereo manuals. I recommend reading 2001 and 2010."
4,"Slow, but thoughtful. A good book.","Most of the entire book is slow to develope, but on the whole 2061 is a thoughtful, more introspective look at an aged Heywood Floyd and the journey he embarks on to a comet, which quickly turns into a crashlanding in forbidden territory. Each of the 2001 novels has an emotion all there own, and based on what it tries to be, 2061 is beyond compare to anything I have read before. Read it."
3,"A good read, but too slow","I would lie if I say that it's a bad book and an awful story. The fun fact is that it isn't. This book is highly informative and has a good story. But the book by itself is too slow, it can't be compared with the last two. Action? , well, the important thing is that all of us who have read this book are still alive. But despite all this, it's worth reading. What I just didn't like is Bowman's position. He supposedly became an omnipotent and omnipresent entity, just like a god. But instead of that, he asks for help. But never mind, if you enjoyed the last two books, you'll like this one."
3,Rather disappointing...,"I tell you that this book is not bad. But it is so poor when compared to the first two books, especially the magneficant 2001: A Space Odyssey.I couldn't understand why Halley appears in this novel. I first thought that a monolith will be found on the core of the comet, and using Helley as a moving satellite of solar system. Well... It wasn't. And what is HAL? He is no longer a computer anymore. I really loved HAL, the arrogant."
3,"Slow at first, sort of picks up toward the end","""2061"" is sort of the beginning of the decline of the series. ""2001"" sort of defeated the purpose of the story, but it was interesting to read (for someone who saw the movie, that is). ""2010"" was a fascinating, albeit unneeded story. Though ""2061"" is a relatively interesting book, it's kind of stupid. What motivation ($?) did Clarke have for the story. If Clarke had been a no-name trying to get something like this published, it never would have happened. It goes around in circles for about 200 pages, with only the last fifty-some to give it some salvation. For die hards ONLY."
3,Nice sequel and nice action story,Unfortunately there nearly no new ideas for the story. It's only a repeat of 2001 and 2010. There are too much parts taken of the first two book. But when you are a fan of Clarke then it's a must read and better than much other SF books i've read.
2,"compared to his other writing, this is a thin gruel","While I thought that the book version of the 2001 film was ok and 2010 one of Clarke's best novels, I was extremely disappointed by this add-on. Clarke is running out of ideas, yet must have been enticed to write this extension with a good contract. He really has very little to add here, so he recycles the characters of Bowman (transmogrified by his absorption into the obelisk) and Hayword, who was a plot device in 2001. Thus, the drama of what is going on is pretty forgettable, which is exactly what I have done. Clearly, Clarke was losing his unique powers when he wrote this. I just wish he had had the sense to stop, because this is a mere shadow of what he accomplished in better novels.Not recommended."
