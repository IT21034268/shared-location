2,Disappointing ending,I hate books like this. You read and read forever and then the ending is so disappointing!
4,"Isabel, The story was not finished !","Hi,The story is great and the characters have an intense life story.The book was Wonderfully written , but there are more events that should have been completed.Hi Isabel...Do you intend to write a sequel ?"
3,A tad bit too wordy.,"Over all I liked the book. The author tends to go on and on in areas. Loved learning about the characters. Once again, why do we need to stick the f____ in ? Never needed it!!!"
2,A Disappointment to a True Allende Fan,"I have always classified myself as a die-hard Allende fan, but Daughter of Fortune has caused me to reevaluate my devotion. The lengthy descriptions I've savored as poetry in Allende's previous works I found to be dry and dull in Daughter of Fortune. The character development was shallow and I found the plot to be predictable. >sigh< This was not Allende's finest work by any stretch..."
3,Too Many Questions Left Unanswered,"I really wanted to like this book, and although parts of it were interesting, overall I rate it as mediocre. The adventure parts of the novel were much better than the ""romance."" Too many questions were left unanswered, however. Do Eliza and Rose ever reconcile? If so, does Rose and/or the rest of the family move to California to be with Eliza, or do they return to Chile? How does Eliza deal with her anger when she discovers that she has a father, but all her life was made to believe she was an orphan by the people who supposedly love her most? And what becomes of the relationship between Eliza and Tao? As much as we would like to believe they lived happily ever after, in reality, it is hardly likely that they could have forged a future together. They would not have been accepted in any society in the mid-1800's. This book is worth reading if you don't expect too much. It is not one you will remember for the rest of your life."
1,This book never connected,"The premise of this story was promising, but it just never connected. I did not find the characters to be believable. I did enjoy the historical and cultural information, but I was never able to quite believe this story. These people never fleshed out into humanity and their story seemed to go nowhere. I have read worse, but I picked up this book with hopes of a good read. Finished it right away but with a sense of disappointment."
2,Very disappointing,"Isabel Allende, who is usually a marvelous writer, has this time written nothing more than a tepid romance novel. Also, she fills the second half of this book spitting out facts about the California Gold Rush, giving the impression that she is trying to woo us with all the research she did on this period in history. I do not recommend Daughter of Fortune."
1,Not Substantial,"The story had potential early on, but then it became trivial and predictable. Not worth reading."
3,Ended as it should have,"I know that many people felt this book's ending left too many questions unanswered, but I feel that the book ended just exactly as it should have ended. No neat and tidy answers, just like real life. Eliza was no longer the same person that had pursued her lover so many years before, and her response at the end was her way of discarding her past, and moving on with her new life, whatever that may be. While most people like to have a resolution at the end of a book, it is not always necessary for me to enjoy a book, if it is well written. I did think this book tended to drag a bit in the middle, when she was following her lover to San Francisco, but Eliza's relationship with Tao Chien saved the book for me. Just don't expect too much in the way of a resolution at the end."
3,Where's the next chapter?,"I really liked the book and liked the different storylines, however, it seemed all the stories were beginning to get very interesting when the book abruptly ended. Did Miss Rose ever make it to San Francisco, what happened to Tao and Eliza's relationship? What about Paulina's trip back to Chile to see her father? Definately anouther chapter to converge the story lines would have ended the book on a more satisfying note!"
2,Dissappointing New Book,I must say I way pretty dissappointed in this book and finished it just because Allende had written it and I was waiting for it to improve. The characters are very implausible and the storyline goes nowhere really. I would suggest that people save their money and reread House of the Spirits.
2,Wait for the paperback,"I enjoyed the general sense of history and adventure in this book, but the story of Eliza got reduced more and more once the halfway point was reached. The writing became very simple, using unimaginative language that was not at all compelling. After four years of searching for her lost lover, we are told that ""She wasn't sure of her feelings and she didn't know whether it was love or pride that was driving her to wait for him ."" This sounded to me like something out of a Harlequin Romance novel. Wasn't sure?? After four years of hell??I found the ending to be yawningly predictable, and not at all interesting. After all of that reading, I at least wanted something that validated this tragic journey. This was a woman who had braved the ocean and a number of life threatening situations, and yet the ending might just as well have said ""and she lived happily ever after."""
4,Triumphant!,"This book was excellent in my opinion. The main character goes through so many life stages and heartaches, yet comes out triumphant in her own way -- yet, not in the way she planned. A fabulous look at the way society was then -- only the acceptable people are ""acceptable."" A Great Book!"
2,Left a bit to be desired...,"I finished the book, but I had to force myself. The characters were intriguing, but the story line drew on so long that it became monotonous. I feel that Allende could have told the story in 100 fewer pages.The ending was not what I anticipated, but for all the story lines that were created within the whole book, it sure didn't give me a sense of closure."
4,Fascinating Journey,"I have enjoyed Isabel Allende's previouse works and was once again pleased with Daughter of Fortune. I thoroughly enjoyed Eliza Sommers journey. While some reviewers have expressed frustration with the ending, I felt it was logical and satisfactory. I would love to see a sequel where Miss Rose joins brother John for a new life in California, leaving Jeremy in Chile. Such strong female characters..I loved them all and would enjoying reading more about them."
4,Lovely,I thought this was a beautiful book full of atmosphere and well-developed characters. Ms. Allende has clearly done her research both with regard to the setting as well as the craft of writing. An excellent read.
2,Disapointing for Ms. Allende's talents,"I am a fan of Ms. Allende (especially The House of the Spirits) but found this book not to her standards of storytelling. Ms. Allende had obviously done much research on conditions in CA during the gold rush and felt motivated to build some sort of story around it. But it just didn't work for me. And the ending was such a disappointment. We're left to imagine what happens - maybe I'm just simple but I like things wrapped up a bit more. As an example, what happened to all of Eliza's jewels?"
2,Not that great.,"From start to end, her use of prose was not even a poor reflection of other books by Allende."
1,Embarassing Effort by Allende,"I am so disappointed in Isabel Allende. Previously a big fan of House of the Spirits and Paula, this book turned me off completely. It read as though it had been composed by a mooning teenager rather than a world class author. The story lacks depth and is one of the most tedious sagas I've ever waded through. The heroine Eliza is anemic, the love story frankly unbelievable and the Chinese character just a shade shy of caricature. Blech!Phooey! I think Oprah rescued this book from the scrap pile of the remainder box, because it's hard to imagine why anyone would seek out this putrid soap opera piece otherwise. If Allende can't do any better than this, she should find another line of work."
2,Soap Opera,"With this book Isabel Allende has attempted a leap from magical realism (""The House of the Spirits,"" ""Eva Luna,"" ""Of Love and Shadows"") into conventional historical drama, unfortunately with a most unsuccessful result. It does not measure to her previous writings! Using a wide canvas and multi-ethnic characters, the author goes into the realm of absurdity, of unrealistic twists of plots, boring and inconsistent characters. Dealing with the old and never-ending ""love theme"" can only be stretched up to a certain point, otherwise the result becomes a soap opera. And as much as soap operas are popular, so does this book became popular. The result is clear: reviews have been extremits, it's either ""love it"" or ""hate it!"" The main character's (Eliza) last words are: ""I am free!"" For some readers it was a relief, but others wanted more... Disappointment for readers of Isabel Allende, disappointment for the choice made by Oprah."
2,Merely a pleasant story...,"This book tells a story, but had no particularly interesting insights, no real content. Was kind of like a gothic romance... Reading it was like doing too-simple crossword puzzle - just something to pass the time. This was my first Isabel Allende book. I think I'll move on..."
3,Entertaining Summer Read!,"At first, I didn't like Allende's lengthy, descriptive writing style. Rather than having the reader get to know the characters by way of dialogue, we have a chance at hearing the personal thoughts of each of the characters (but not as a first person narrative.)I found the story both riveting and charming. Having taken many California History Classes at CAL, I was able to truly enjoy how Allende spun both California History and Folklore into her own tale. I think it's fantastic that Allende was able to give her story a multicultural perspective--she really captured the spirit of what it means to be a Californian. As a Chinese-American, I was pleasantly surprised that Allende made it a point to describe the racism that persisted against communities of color at the time (which is rarely portrayed in most novels of the West.)On the whole, it was a fun story!"
2,Empty Ending,"Daughter of Fortune was ""somewhat"" capturing in the first half of the book, then it started to drag. The rest of the way, I was struggling to get through the next chpaters, hoping it would be more fulfilling. I was then forced to read it to the end since I had put so much time and hope into it. The ending was abrupt, and disappointing, leaving me empty and frustrated!"
3,"Enjoyable, but not the best","I have been an Allende fan ever since I happened upon the film version of House of the Spirits. Since then I have been voracious about her work. This one is a little more concrete than I have come to expect from her. I much prefer her ""ethereal"" works such as House, Eva Luna, and Of Love and Shadows. Daughter of Fortune, however, is more to my liking than was Infinite Plan."
4,This has to be one of the best books i've read lately.,"As a 16 year old high-school student, i found this book to have been a very enjoyable read. The prose is rich with detail, the tale is adventurous, and it gives a lot of information out about the gold rush in California. The background detail the author provided about the other characters let you see their different points of view and how they fit into the story. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the amount of coverage the prostitution element of the story got."
3,Needed a better ending,"I thought this book was excellent in the way it captured the history and times of the mid-1800's. I especially enjoyed watching Eliza & Tao's relationship grow, but was dissapointed not knowing how they came out. I think the book should have gone further - after all, an interracial relationship in those times would have been interesting and would have made the story better.I found that when Eliza was off on her own, her character was not as interesting as when she was with Tao. To be honest, there should have been some physical point of the relationship - it left me feeling dissapointed.Overall the story was good, but my heart sank on the last page when I had done all that reading and expected a good ending."
2,Couldn't stick with it,I think this book had good potential but was a little too fluffy for me. I thought that it was very unoriginal and predictable. I also found that I didn't want to pick it up; it became more of a chore than anything. I've recently been bored of Ophra's choices.
4,A Satisfying Read,"This book is very enjoyable if you are a fan of Isabel Allende's past novels.While it is not as terrifically engaging or engrossing as the ""House of the Spirits"", it is a wonderful testament to the bygone era of the Forty-Niners. Perhaps the novel dwells too much on the history taking place around Eliza, the main character, and forgets to continue to build such a fascinating character. Still, definitely worth reading. But if you want something that will keep you glued to your reading chair, read ""House of the Spirits"". A great lesson in recent history and a great story as well!"
4,Careful attention to details,"A lot of people say that this book has an abrupt ending, that it needs a sequel.. but Allende gave so many ""hints"" into the future of Eliza's life that a sequel is certainly not needed. This is definitely a book where small details cannot be skipped and skimmed, 'cause ya might miss a few clues if you do.Otherwise, the novel was a good early morning read during my subway ride to Manhattan. Allende transported me into another era, another world. Everything was described in such lush detail that I could smell the odor of every character in the book.Tao Chi'en and the scent of the sea. Eliza's cooking. Rose's vanilla perfume. Joaquin's sweat.*yummmmm....."
2,Not her best,"Isabel, the author of so many sensible books, lost her hand in this predictable story about a girl and her journey to find her love. The first part, that takes place in Latin America, is better than the one that takes place in California. All the profound beauty of her previous books is missing in this new one."
2,Chose an earlier Allende book to read,"I just got home from a book group in which we discussed this book. Of the 6 women there, no one was overly enthused. The general feeling was that while all of the detail was interesting in a historical sense, it was not presented in a way that advanced the plot or aided in character development. We cared about a few of the characters but most others seemed shallowly drawn. We were not riveted to the resolution of Eliza's search for her true love. All thought the ending was predictable.Allende fans in the group all advised reading some of her earlier works to see why she is so popular. There is too much wonderful fiction to read out there to spend time on this mediocre work."
4,is there a sequel??,"This was the first book by the author that I had read. She is a gifted writer who really hooks the reader early. I loved reading it but I wasn't thrilled with the ending. It was as though the author should have wrote ""...to be continued"" after the conclusion. I have read 2 more books by Isabel Allende and so far House of Spirits is my favorite. I recommend that one to everyone I know--I have even given it as a Christmas gift."
3,More than you'll ever want to know....,"...about the California gold rush and race relations in 1800's California. Aside from the portions that dealt with these issues, ad nauseum, this book was a decent read. This was my first Isabel Allende book and from the reveiws I have seen,The House of the Spirits must be better. I found the narrative somewhat uneven but the character development was excellent. By the end of the book, I felt a kinship with Eliza and the other major characters."
2,what in the world happened to allende?,"I am a huge fan of Allende's work, and as soon as this book came out I ran to the bookstore to get it. The beginning of the book had me really excited and wanting more, and then I don't know what happened. The first reaction I had when I finished the book was anger. How can such a brilliant writer and storyteller have possibly gotten so lazy from the middle to the end of this story. If you guys want to read a brilliant story by this lady go out and buy THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS. Don't waste your money and time reading mediocre writing by an excellent writer. Buy her good stuff, and save yourself the disappointment."
2,The story was incomplete.,"I wouldn't recommend this book. It started off well and seemed to drag on in the middle and then ended abruptly with many loose ends. I thought that many aspects of the story were undeveloped, while others were drawn out. The abrupt ending left me very frustrated and unsatisfied, with many unanswered questions. It actually seemed like she got tired of the story and didn't know how to end it.I bought this book because I had enjoyed ""Portrait in Sepia"" so much that I assumed that this book would be equally enjoyable, but it really wasn't."
2,"Good beginning, disappointing ending","I've loved previous Isabel Allende works, and the beginning of this book has all the promise of its predecessors. Unfortunately, the book quickly shifts into a ""wild west"" cliche, with plot twists that are unbelievable, characters that don't deliver, and endless pages of ""California gold rush"" descriptions that are unoriginal and ultimately, boring. I found this book to be a real disappointment, especially from a gifted writer such as Allende."
3,A few flaws in strong female characters,"""Dauther of Fortune"" presents two strong women: Rose and her foundling daughter. Rose is a woman who has sacrified her future in a society that does not forgive past transgressions. Her foundling daughter is much more impulsive and uses her social error to escape an unforgiving society. These two women are strong characters in their own time and i doubt that Rose would almost give up her existence because of loss. Nor, would her foulding daughter need to see her lover dead in order to be free of him. The author has created two strong female characters that then submit to stereotypical behaviors. This is a good adventure story with lots of backgound about the gold rush and its participants; however, the story ends too neatly and quickly for the adventure that is represents."
3,Good Historical fiction,"I just finished reading Daughter of Fortune and I have to agree with some of the reviews that state the ending of the story left alot to be desired. The story line was captivating, and the characters were vivid and easy to imagine in the mind's eye. Tao Chien's spirituality and wisdom was well executed for the reader to enjoy. I also enjoyed the historical fiction imparted to the story relating to the Gold Rush. However, Allende left her readers who ""traveled"" on this long journey with Eliza unfulfilled. At the end of this novel it is left up to our imagination as to what Eliza, Tao and the Sommer family's plights will be. My thought was that Allende must be planning a sequel since she left so many of those details up to the reader's imagination and speculations. I would recommend reading this book but you can walk, don't run to the bookstore for it."
2,Just scratching the surface,"Having to read this book for a book club was the only reason I got beyond the first 100 pages of this poorly crafted book. After reading Memoirs of a Geisha and The Poisonwood Bible ( two of the best books I have read in a year), this was an enormous disappointment. I felt the character development was shaky and with so many ""life stories,"" I was at times unclear who the protagonist was. I never felt myself rooting for Eliza (was she the main character! ). I find it disappointing when all of the love stories begin with love at first sight...seems a bit Danielle Steel-ish to me. Too many countries, experiences, ethnicities, cultures, and characters...just develop people that I want to know more about and the story becomes a rich part of their experience."
2,Very disappointing,"After hearing the author speak on a local radio program, I was intrigued enough to pick up this book. What a letdown. After reading 70 pages, I have to stop. As many other reviewers have noted, it is full of one-dimensional characters, cheesy and unbelievable romance cliches, and hokey mystic references. Save your money and your time, don't buy this book"
1,Drags on & on with little plot or resolution,"I read this book as a book club selection. I could barely finish it. The author carries the adventure through California long enough for boredom to set in. I enjoy a much faster paced book. Also, it was unrealistic that a woman would be able to interact so closely with so many people without anyone detecting she was a woman. Come on."
1,"Good potential, but ultimately disappointing","I thought this was going to be a good old-fashioned historical epic. Instead, it was a deadly boring diatribe about the sordid conditions of prostitutes and people of color in Gold Rush California. Eliza wasn't a compelling central character. Miss Rose was much more interesting. And am I the only one who noticed that Isabel Allende co-opted characters and an exact scene from that Antonio Banderas film ""The Mask of Zorro?"" Maybe Harry Love, Joaquin Murieta and Three-Finger Jack were real historical figures and this was their true story, but I found that a discordant note in what is supposedly a prestigious novel by a revered author."
1,Is there a stronger word than 'disappointing' for this novel,"'Brilliant' says The New York Times! Did they give this novel to an Editorial Assistant to review? They can not be serious surely? Daughter of Fortune is written with no warmth and where is the beautiful prose-like words that we have become accustomed to with Allende? Nowhere to be seen. The characters were so compellingly boring that, can I admit to you dear Amazon surfers, after the first 38 pages, I returned the novel to my bookstore and asked for a refund. The general consensus seems to be with so-called respected media reviewers that they hail a novel just because the author has been revered in the past. Surely someone out there must agree with me that this story does not belong to Allende - the words are empty. I wouldn't even recommend this novel for the beach - trust me."
3,Where's the beef?,"I started this novel with high hopes. The author has a great way of drawing you in, weaving a story, creating characters but to what end? Nada. The descriptions are fascinating especially in the Gold Rush period. But I felt no connection to these characters except for one (the aunt) and we never found out what made her tick. I read on and on, waiting for key that would bring it all together and be the emotional center for this story. It never came and so, sadly, I cannot recommend this book."
2,Very Average,"This book is too violent; the gory descriptions make it hard to concentrate on the supposed love story. Tao is the only truly interesting and deep character. The book does get more interesting towards the end, but my suggesstion is read something else. (Memoirs of a Geisha or I Know this Much is True)"
2,"The ""no end"" story","Allende's book is about an abandoned girl who was raised up by an English family living in Chile. When she grows up, she falls in love with a Chilean boy who later decides to go to California in search of gold.The young girl then travels to San Francisco to find the boy and resume their love story.The plot, as you see, is not very original although the end certainly is: there isn't any."
2,Crappy ending,"you know what, i have mixed feelings about this book. At times it was interesting, but in the end i didn't feel i knew as much about the characters as i would have liked. It did drag many a time, only to lead to a most unsatisfying ending, seems almost lazy on the part of the author."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Extremely disappointing! The only redeeming factor was the historical content and the somewhat interesting look at the gold rush California years. The story (if one finds a story) in itself was choppy and just sloppily written as if the author became bored with it herself. Parts of the book were just too unbelievable to even imagine and the ending was ludicrous with too many loose ends. Come on, Oprah....we know you like books with strong female characters, but next time could you please pick one that at least tells a good, believable story!"
2,Daughter of Pain,I was more than disappointed in this book. When I got to the end it felt like it had never really started and I wished that I hadn't spent the time reading it. I have heard her other stuff was better... but trust me skip this one.
2,Unsatisfying Ending,"I read 400 odd pages for that ending?! I enjoyed the characters however there were too many of them for the author to thoroughly explore. The end of the book was abrupt - seemed as if she had used up her word count and had to finish the book in a hurry. And similarly the fantastic locations (Chile, California and China) were only touched on. A very frustrating read."
2,read something else...,"reading this book was a waste of time. a predictable romance novel with characters as interesting as shallow mud puddles -- was trying to walk around them the entire read. cant believe this is what is being passed off a good modern literature, her writing style reminded me of some cardboard I ate when I was a child -- I have seen more compelling sentences bill boards. now I know what I have *not* been missing by skipping best sellers -- will *not* be selecting any Oprah Book Club selections to read in the future. read bukowski, joyce, colin dexter or mary karr instead."
3,"Good enough to make me finish it, but....","unsatisfying enough to make me regret putting in the time. The story was mediocore, the characters only slightly better. It was the flow of the novel and anicipation of the ending that kept me reading. But be warned - this book has the most unsatisfying, let-down ending I've ever encountered. I expected much more from a book this highly spoken of. I was disappointed on all fronts. It gets three stars because, as I've said, it was good enough to make me finish it."
2,Pulp Romance,"This book is simply a pulp romance attempting, I suppose, to fictionalize a point in history, the mid to late 19 century and a Chilean foundling's misadventures, sans corsette, among the plunderers of the California gold rush and beyond. It is a surprisingly weak addition to Oprah's book club."
2,Snoozeville,This book was flat and boring -- reading this book seemed like chewing cardboard. Spare your brain cells the pain of this book.
5,Another Work of Genius,"Daughter of Fortune is my favorite among Isabel Allende's books. Like many of the others she has written, I find it outstanding in its portrayal of its unconventional characters, and full of a subtle humour that is uniquely her own.It provides a vivid portrayal of life on the western coast of North and South America at the time of the gold rush in California in meticulous detail--you feel that you are there, and part of it, as the heroine lives a series of unlikely events and goes to the gold fields in search of her lover.This author's imaginative detailing and descriptive talents bring colourful settings from Chile to California to life, and the entire story is a delightful read.While other reviewers found that there was a problem with the ending, I did not notice that, and have reread it for sheer pleasure more than once."
3,it was ok,good story for a while. second half was less interesting. the history research became more interesting than the story line which dwindled down to a fizzled ending. still easy read and mostly enjoyable.
3,Daughter of Fortune's value ain't what her other books are,"Allende is a wonderful storyteller and this book has her magic touch. She vividly describes Chile, China and gold rush so that you are keenly aware of the setting and background of each scene. She does not miss neither a detail nor a nuance which makes every page real. However, I felt let down by the end of the book. I wanted more from her and felt she was ready to end the book and just finished it. This is still a good read but not the great read her other books were."
4,Exquisitely written.,"Superbly written, (spanish) the novel transported me to Valparaiso and California. Ms Allende has once again proven to be a noteworthy novelist. Do I smell sequel?"
2,not what I had hoped,"I was really disappointed in the main character, Eliza. I thought her aunt was much more of an interesting character and the book should have been more about her. It definitely felt mediocre to me. I finished it just to see if it would redeem itself in the end. Bummer. But not terrible, just blah!"
2,Cliffhanger!,"For as many pages I read, Daughter of Fortune came to a weak climax, and in my opinion never had an ending. It seems like Allende got tired after part 3 and just put her pen down and sent it off to the printer.As other reviewers before me stated, there were to many unfinished story lines! I've got to say, despite my criticisms, that if another book came out completing the tale of Eliza Sommers, I'd buy it."
4,Romantic and not corny? How rare.,"I love this book. It was full of romance of course and I don't really like much mushy stuff because mushy stuff can lead to corny lines and doings and all things corny but man, I was caught up in all of Eliza's tale from Joaquin to Tao-Chen... it was great. I didn't really want it to end. Isn't it nice to just read a good nice book where you aren't bored of reading it all? I recommend it to everyone. A story of a girl who as a baby was left in a basket outside the door of a rich English family living in Chile. She grows up to become a civilized young lady, smart and educated but falls in love with a poor boy who flees to California and where she too goes to follow the man she fell in love with only to find another man who becomes the real love of her life. Oh lala. I became a sucker for the romance."
1,Christmas order,I order one of these baskets and big boxes with nothing really in them. The cheese in it was the worst tasting ever. We just through it away. Nothing in this basket was good. Crackers were yuck and so was the salami. Never again sticking to Costco baskets from now on.
2,Poor customer service,"While the package arrived safely and the recipient expressed gratitude, the Customer service I experienced during the order process was horrendous. Within an 1/2 hour after I ordered the product I tried to go in and do a change of service, simply add a card to the gift basket, however I couldn't because the system wouldnt allow for it. I called customer service and spent hours debating with different levels of customer service, to no avail. They simply didnt have a system that would allow for a simple change of order. I wasnt even allowed to cancel the order and reorder. I like Amazon a lot, I order many things but I will never order a gift basket or food product through them again."
4,Good Basket,"It is ok. not worth $45.00. But it is nice, It doesn't have the wow factor that the pic. has."
2,Dad Complained Items were Flavorless!,"Sent this to my dad for Father's Day and got a note a few days later saying, ""some of the items in it were pretty tastless. The formaggio e vino had no trace of vino whatsoever. Some of the cookies and crackers had no taste to speak of and were only useful to scoop up the formaggio which wasn't remarkable. Whoever sold this to you may want to rethink their source. The basket is nice, however!""So much for a nice Father's day gift!"
1,not even food,"While the thought may be nice, the foods in this basket are food products and have more preservatives than nutritional value. Save your money and appreciation and get something else. If someone really appreciates gourmet or specialty foods, they will be horrified."
1,"Nice presentation, but BAD food!!!","I'm really sorry to have to say this, but I HAVE to be HONEST! This basket was filled with less then desirable processed food-stuffs, I felt like I got a basket of lies. Appealing at first glance ( i.e. the nice picture ), a closer examination and taste of the actual food inside left me disappointed at the army survival canned last-a-thousand-years-on-a-shelf ""food"" they call gourmet.I'd say most reviews of these baskets are done by people who are being polite because they received these baskets as a gift. I, on the other hand, can be honest here because I am self-indulgent enough to buy one for myself."
1,Worse than worthless,A complete waste. Cost was $51.98 ($65.51 with shipping). Contents were probably worth 10 bucks at most and mostly tasteless. My dog didn't want it. Biggest rip-off I've encountered in a long time. I should have taken my wife out for a nice steak dinner.
1,"major disappointment with product, exceptional service from Amazon","this product is not worth the price. Major disappointment when I opened the box. This was supposed to be a gift for my mother, I could never give this to anyone. When I spoke with Amazon customer service they gave me 100% customer satisfaction. Amazon is the best to deal with."
3,Portions are SMALL,Although everything in basket was really tasty all products were very small in portion and very expensive. Would not recommend.
3,Portions could be larger,Sent this as a holiday gift to out of state relatives. They said basket/presentation was nice but the different food items didn't have a large number of pieces per package.
4,Food Parcels,Some friends in the States were going through a difficult time and I wanted to do something to help. Being able to select a basket of goodies via Amazon was a wonderful answer to my problem. It was delivered ahead of time and all the family found something to enjoy in it. I was described as Mrs Anonymous as I hadn't worked out how to include a gift card. My friends were perplexed but it all added to their enjoyment.
3,Average Value But Giftable,"I bought this as a gift so I don't know how the stuff tastes,but there's a good variety of stuff and it looks nice and spiffy.It's not as big as I thought yet not that small either.Basket is Sturdy and it's shrinkwrapped nicely so it's a plus.My recipient said ""WOW"" when he saw it.I give it 3.5 Stars so yes go buy it if there's no other baskets."
4,"Mom""s treat",Art of Appreciation is a fitting title for this basket. On 2 occasions I have sent this basket to my Mother & she has been fully delighted with all the goodies. The value seems to be on target :)
2,beware of very small font,"I was disappointed in this book... all of the cartoons are reduced in size. The font is impossibly small, and both the text and artwork suffer for it. Better to have included less content so that it could be more legible. I had to buy my dad a magnifying glass specifically to read this book. It's a shame - they're great comics."
5,Beautiful!,"I've been getting this magazine for a little over a year now. It's expensive, but well worth it if you're a textile fanatic. Good articles, gorgeous photography...even the ads are nice to look at."
2,Feel a bit like Scrooge but...,"I bought a copy of this magazine because it looked so beautiful on the website. While it is pretty, the articles are short and shallow. Photography credits were absent for an essay on the Nottingham lace industry. Information on actually creating or using materials was limited. Seems to me like another aspirational rather than useful/stimulating periodical along the lines of the equally shallow Real Simple."
1,Um...na..,"this sucks..I love Common Sence's eralier works ( i used to love HER, like water, ressurection)...but the production here is horriblepick Quality by Talib Kweli instead"
2,Common Sense? no.. Common Badu?,"""Ultimately, If you liked Common back in his b-boy days when he hit us with classics like Can I Borrow a Dollar, Resurrection, and One Day It Will All Make Sense, you might be dissapointed, that particular sound within Common has faded away. This album will disappoint a lot of long time heads. I kind of wish he would collaborate with producers NO I.D. and Doug Inf. again. But you really can't be mad at Comm for trying to uplift the current stagnant state of Rap. ""That sums it up pretty much. Common has forgotten about his Chicago roots and continues on this downward spiral of ...-rap. I hope he wakes up and works with Dj Premeir or NO ID. The only notable track for me is #3."
4,Common is a true Hip-Hop legend,"Common does it again. He has been in the game for a while and i personally think his best album is ""like water for chocolate"" but this follow-up is not far behind. His beats are very hipnotic and puts you in a calm and cool collected trance. A great artist. Common Sense has a great outlook on life and it shows in his positive lyrics. This album is a BIG change if all you are used too are his old albums that were made in like 93 up to about 98. He really outpreforms here. He makes the modern day rap scene look like a joke. If you are looking for comercial rap with songs by 50cent ""wankster"" than dont buy this album! That stuff is for the narrow-minded. Common is for the creative and sensual hip-hop/rap listener."
5,I really liked this album...,"I know that everybody dogged this album but to me, this album was like a breath of fresh air cuz the rap game was (is) sooooo very dull and had (has) become very stagnant. I mean with everyone rapping about money, guns, clothes, hoes and the like, it was time for someone to just go off the deep end and get away from all that. That's what Common did on this album. This album was a very nice departure from all that junk. Plus, every song on this album is, well, off the chain and out the yard. I may be one of the few who liked this album, but I'm glad that Common put this one out there cuz it was sorely needed."
4,very different,"Common is on something different. Heavy distorted beats seem to be the theme of this album, I guess thats why its called Electric Circus. He takes it back to 87th street lyrically on a couple of tracks(the Hustle). If you like common pick it up.Yo!"
2,Still Underground....,"This CD [is bad]...it will put you to sleep i assure you...the beats blow and the rhymes are short. Also hes got too much soul built into it...too much erykah badu and mary j. Enough is enough but half the cd is instrumental. Only buy the CD if you are a die hard Common fan, but dont expect an insane performance like that in the past."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?!?!,"First off, I'd like to say that Like Water For Chocolate was one of the best hip hop albums I've ever heard, so I had some big hopes for Electric Circus when I went to pick it up. Now, I'm not against artists expanding their musical horizons and making different music, but the music should at least be good! There are a few tracks on EC that are unlistenable. Electric Wire Hustler is awful, soul power is right up there as well. I was so disappointed after hearing this album, granted there are a few tracks on it that made me bob my head, (track 7 especially), most of it just had me skipping to the next one. its as if Common tried TOO hard to make this album souind different, I think he was a unique rapper before but that just came naturally on Like Water for Chocolate. Its unfortunate, hopefully he can go back to his roots on some of his next projects."
2,A Poor Man's Rakim Meets a Poor Man's Speech,"while COmmon is a Very gifted Word Man He really doesn't have that overall Snap that He trys so hard to Bring on His Albums.this Album has some interesting elements but overall it gets a bit tongue tied for my taste.for me He still Sounds too much like a Speech Leftover&He while He raises topics in His Work He still is a Poor Man's Rakim too me overall.this Album too me Seems overshadowed by the production&with each Album Common has moved further away from His Past Albums with His ""Keep IT Real"" Vibe.the Outkast meets Jimi Hendrix Vibe He tries too take on this Album is a Good Effort but He is missing a Key element for me overall:Depth."
3,Well...I don't really know what to say,"As one must suspect with every Common cd, there are going to be solid beats and incredible lyrics. Well, some of these songs really don't have lyrics I don't think, which is the problem with this cd. It has no direction at all. I seriously cannot stand ""Jimi was a Rockstar"" and the last track of the cd, I simply have no idea what is actually going on or what I'm listening to. However, if you are an open-minded hip hop fan or any kind of rock fan, you should love this cd.My top songsCome CloseElectric Wire Hustler FlowerHeaven SomewhereSoul PowerOverall, I'd suggest you pick up ""One Day It'll All Make Sense"" or ""Ressurection"" instead but this cd is pretty nice."
2,Boring,"Common has proven that he has skills, but Electric Circus tries too hard to be different. Picture a guy who wears clip on dreadlocks just to impress girls who listen to Bob Marley. Something about this CD doesn't feel sincere.The tracks ""Come Closer (The Bonita Applebum Jack)"" and ""Music"" are cool. I give Common props for having the guts to go into gun fight with a knife, but this CD ended up with a lot of holes in it."
3,Inspiring streaks get worn down,"A few standouts, (usually when female interplay is utilized) do not erase the pervading mediocrity inherent in most beats, rhymes, and sampling despite the whole rock theme. Common is still way less (common) then most rappers around, and his feminist-tinged hip-hop manifestos are always refreshing, but he still continued to refine and pursue that masterwork he seemed able to achieve."
1,GARBAGE...DON'T BUY IT!!,This cd is a P.O.S.!! Common has gone waaaay left and far off his usual course. I was a diehard Common fan...now my interest has died hard. The album title says it all. Too much head-banging electric guitar. Kinda like a three-ring circus. Too much going on to pay attention to any one thing. One big heap of nonsense. Find your focus Common and stick with what works. This cd ain't happening!
2,COMMON PLEASE DONT PUT OUT NOTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN.,"NO DISS,JUST BEING MYSELF...THIS WAS THE ONLY ALBUM I COULD NOT GET IN TO,JIGGA J LET ME LISTEN TO HIS THIRD AND IT WAS BETTER THAN THIS ALBUM RIGHT HERE,BUT GOOD TO HAVE IF YOU GOT ALL OF COMMON ALBUMS."
1,I Used To Love H.E.R. ???????,"Common has fell off. I don't know what's goin on with this album. I'm just trying to figure out exactly what it is he's trying to accomplish or prove with this album. It's basically experimental ... I don't like a single song on this album. It's too `out there'. Sounds like some techno mixed with rock & roll and trance...I wouldn't even call this hip hop. Even the single, Come Close featuring Mary J. Blige, was borderline wack. ... Not recommended."
1,Dont get it twisted!,"You want to ruin a album?- put the Neptunes in charge of making the beats. This is hands down is the worst album Common has made with the neptunes. I dont know what common was thinking but this isnt even hip-hop. The only good song is Come Close with Mary J. Blige. I tried to listen to the album but after the second time around I knew i was right the first time. The beats are some kind of phsycadelic sounds that could be appreciated by Wood Stock fans. If you dont believe me, sample the beats-I dont make this stuff up people. Ive been listening to Hip-Hop since the 80's so I should know the difference."
3,HOMEBOY,DO YOUR THANG HOMEBOY WILD 100 ALL THE WAY DJ DILEMMA FROM CHI-TOWN GOT U AND 50 CENTS ON MY MIXTAPES
5,Beyond His Time! ONE FOR THE COLLECTION!!,"I have 3 words for this CD!!!!DOPE! DOPE! DOPE!The younger guys might not enjoy this until they are older, so save it for later... trust me!This CD is a must for your collection!!Experience the whole spectrum of hip-hop that COMMON pushes his songs too. TRIPPED OUT beats will have you bobbing your head, and mixed with the poetic rythym lyrics of COMMON! PURE DOPE!I didn't really enjoy his Chocolate album, but once I heard this, Like I said ""It was DOPE!!"" I was hooked!I really look forward to what comes after this!?Peace Out!-pOy"
5,Head and shoulders above the rest!,"This new Common album is by far his best work to date and easily the best album of the year. Exploring new sounds (for hip hop) with his consistantly sharp lyrics, this is an instant classic. The production, though experimental and different, is perfectly matched by Commons lyrics that stand out as much as the soundscape. If you are a fan of Music, not just Hip Hop, then you'll love this CD. A must have for any Common fan."
3,"ambitious, no doubt...","I am probably the biggest Common fan around and for me, this was the most anticipated album of the year. That being said, ""electric circus"" did not deliver the goods I was waiting for. I mean, Common has been comming correct to the game of hip hop for a while now. He already had, in his own, innovative and street poetic, style changed hip hop for the better over the years. It shouldn't have taken such a different, ""weird"" approach this time around for the man to solidify his place in the game and I am utterly dissapointed that he felt the need to do so. I understand that Common is full of ambition and artistic creativity, but he should have continued to grow within the construct that he himself established. Do NOT expect a RESURRECTION, nor anything of the sort. If you are a dedicated Common fan, then get it to show your support. I personally recommend for all true Common fans to unite and write him asking him to come back to earth, because he is sorely missed."
2,This isn't classic Common Sense,"Well,I'm supprised to see how well Common's reviews have been getting on here. I do give props to the true MC's who venture and try something new. But at the same time, when it is a sound that's not them, I can't stand. Common seems to go against everything he has preached against. Which is selling out. With the artists that are featured on here, it seems like that's what he's doing. It sounds like he's trying to do new things to gain audiences. I could be wrong, but look at who he has on his album. People can implement new sounds and still sound nice. Listen to Mighty Mos Def's new cd. It still sounds like he has the rawness that got him the respect back in the early 90's with Urban Thermon Dynamics. I hope Common will at least go back to some of the raw sounds that truly gave him a lot of respects from pure hip hop fans. I hope he can go back to being the real mc we all came to love."
3,Not for everyone,"Common is one of those oddly inconsistent rappers-- when he's good, he's amazing, when he's not so good, he takes a really weird turn. Electric Circus is one of those really weird turns in my opinion. Common goes for a very different, techno/electro style on this one, with mixed results. While some of these tracks work ""Jimi Was a Rock Star"" is a favorite, I have been largely unimpressed with this album. Of course, ""Come Close"", which arbitrarily eschews the eccentricity of the album, is one of the strongest tracks. I highly suggest you listen to the samples or full tracks on Youtube/Grooveshark before you buy."
4,Common Sence makes a masterpiece,"Wow...this album is amazing. ""Jimi Was a Rock Star"" is my favorite track on the album. Everything Common does is always John Blaze. A definite must buy for any hip-hop fans collection."
3,Good idea for OXO products,"We were tired of having brushes and sponges laying all over so we bought this. I love the design and function. My only issue is that it doesn't hold every brush well. We have one OXO brush and one Munchkin baby bottle brush. The OXO brush stands up well, but just about every other brush tips over constantly. Otherwise it's a great product."
3,"Good Design but NOT stainless, WILL RUST","I'm big on every day household products that are useful and efficient but also have aesthetic appeal. I live in a modern loft style home. There is very little ""hidden"" space. Everything is out in the open to be seen, so I like to keep things as clean and organized as possible. I thought I had found this in the Oxo stainless steel sink organizer. I wanted something that took up minimal space, but also looked as nice as a sink organizer could. I know, I'm asking a lot! So, when a product is labeled ""stainless steel"" I don't expect it to sprout rust stains after less than a few months use. I've had this product for just about a year now and I already need to replace it. It looks gross. My review otherwise would be all five stars if it wasn't for the rust issue."
1,Great Product... minus one fatal flaw.,Let me begin by saying that this product is well put together and holds the OXO brushes well. I like the design and it is easy to use. Emptying the tray is simple. For the first week the product was exactly what I had hoped for.Now onto the fatal flaw. This product is clearly advertised as being made of stainless steel. There is even a big sticker on the bottom of the tray reminding the user that it is stainless steel. This is a false claim. The product began to rust within two weeks of moderate use. Every part of tray that water touches (basically the entire thing) is clearly showing rust.
2,"Overpriced, poor design.","I bought this at Bed Bath & Beyond for $24.99 recently - I have no idea why - I think I was intoxicated by the wall-o-gadgets and the bright lighting. Anyway - I'm returning today. It's lame! My complaint is mostly with the Oxo brush and sponge scrubbers that go with it (you have to purchase them separately) and the way they LEAK dishsoap down the handles. I'd understand if it was happening with just one of them - things are duddy sometimes - but this is happening with BOTH of them. Poor design.This tray, though - it's basically a petri dish for growing bacteria in the gross water it catches. You have to clean it out all the time or it will literally stink up your kitchen. JUST SAY NO. You don't need trendy matchy match stuff for your kitchen. If you think the cheaper (but better made) sponge holders are ugly, stick them under the cabinet. This thing is just a total waste of money."
2,Rusting now,"I bought this in September 2009. It is meant to be near water. It is rusting at all the junction points. I'm disappointed. It works pretty well as an organizer although things do tip out of their slot at times. You have to hold all the items in it to empty the plastic water catcher below the stainless steel drain. If it is stainless steel, why does it rust?"
2,Rusts very easily,"Great looking design that works well with the other Oxo sink accessories, but the fact that it rusts easily is a deal breaker. It's too bad because I love all my other Oxo sink accessories (like the soap pump, soap dispensing brush, etc.), and it would have been nice to have a matching organizer for all of them."
3,Does the job!,This is a nice product but I had a few issues with it. 1) you have to use a certain soap dispenser in order for it to sit in the spot 2) My sponges fall off a lot even though they are the OXO design 3) Make sure you clean out the tray in the bottom or else it REALLY stinks when you decide to do it.
3,fine for what it is,"This is a fine unit if you use it exactly the way it was designed - one soap pump, two brushesNot much flexibility"
5,Perfect for our needs,"This product has brought untold happiness to my retentive, germ-freak husband! We were using a dish, and the goop that would settle in the dish was really bugging him. Our two sink staples are a small round scrubber brush that you put dish soap inside and a sponge. The round portion on this product fits the scrubber perfectly, and we set the sponge on it's side between the metal bars. A perfect fit! Have been using it for a few weeks now and love it :-)"
5,Good Product!,As far as I can tell...you really cannot go wrong with a Oxo product...bought this with the soap brush and dish soap dispenser and they look Fab together! Again Great Product and Great Price! Thanks Amazon & Oxo!
5,Organized Bliss!,"When I stumbled across this as I was looking for Christmas gifts I thought I had died and gone to heaven! This was just what I had been searching years for! It's a way to neatly organize sponges, wands and scrubbers. I've had the OXO wands for years and loved them but could never find a way to store them neatly and w/o taking up alot of space. This is fantastic! Looks good and works great! I love the fact that the water that drains from the wands (etc) after using them is gathered and kept away from everything. A quick tip of the unit into the sink and away goes the mess!LOVE this unit!!!"
3,"Looks great, not quite rustproof","I was looking for a stainless steel organizer, and this was by far one of the better looking ones. Plus, I like OXO, and have many of their products.The organizer works fine, but it seems that the area where the wire brush/sponge holder attaches to the base is prone to rusting. Perhaps they welded or soldered it with a rust-prone metal? Anyway, I like it overall, but I was disappointed to see that it wasn't quite entirely stainless."
2,"Great idea, poor design.","The rusting and collection of stagnant water in the tray are a problem, yes, (the first is avoidable; the second inevitable) but the worst for me is that OXO's own brushes don't fit into the holder well. They fit, but not right. The rubber push-pad on the brush handle hits the top of the wire holder if you put the brush into the holder with the bristles over the drip tray. This is the most logical way to place the brush so that water drips into the tray and not onto the counter, but because the wire holder comes up a scant half- or even quarter-inch too high, I have to turn the brush outward, with the result that the drips go onto the counter instead. I've tried this with both types of OXO brush holders, the all-steel one and the plastic one; it's the same with both, although the plastic ones seems to fit a bit better. Apparently no one at OXO actually tried these together. Maybe they weren't meant to be used together? If not, why not? Not the quality I expect from OXO."
1,Not stainless steel ...,"It's been almost a month and It is tarnished . I cannot return the item because of return window is expired. Do not buy this item. If I did buy this from a store, I could return it in a year."
3,"Good, but rusts","I agree with previous reviews. It's perfect for holding the brushes and sponges from OXO, but mine is starting to rust after a few months, and, even though you can empty the drip pan, it's getting pretty gross in there. I'm still using it, but don't know how much longer this will last."
2,Great at first but didn't hold up...,"I used to keep my dish brushes in the sink and could never find them under the dishes, so I purchased this organizer. I loved it at first. It looked nice and held both our dish brushes and our soap dispenser. However, after several weeks, it started to rust. Not only that, a black stain started to form underneath it on our counter. No matter how often I cleaned the bottom, the black stain would come back and it was very hard to get clean. After a couple of months of dealing with this rusty organizer and stained counter, I just gave up and threw it away. I really wish it had been made better and been able to withstand being wet. This is not a good product and I do not recommend it."
4,replaced old plastic one,Looks so much nicer than the plastic one. Cant see all the residue. Spruced up my favorite scrubber collection. Nice addition to my kitchen.
5,Happy,"I love this because I hated being limited to whatever I could store around my sink. With this, I have 2 brushes, a sponge & scrubber for tough jobs. The cleaning item I need is always handy, and their is a water catcher on the bottom so that when your brushes & sponges drain, it isn't all over your counter, and you can remove it, drain it, clean it out, and it is all very simple."
5,Must Read,"Have you ever met someone that you ""know in your soul"" you've known for a very long time but are actually meeting for the first time? Have you been somewhere for the very first time and know that there is something familiar about this place? This book helps you understand the 'soul connection' with a person or place from another lifetime. It gives meaning to the term ""soulmate"". A good read for anyone interested in past life regression and how it relates to the person we are in this lifetime."
2,Not too interesting...,"I bought this game for my 5 year old son. He really liked the movie and I mistakenly thought the game would be very similar. Some people might like it, but my son found it to be very boring and repetetive. You choose a character and then your character has to fight another monster in a room, which varies with each level. There are many different rooms to choose from, but the problem is that there is no story line; it's all fighting. My son likes games which have a story and puzzles to solve, etc. Monsters Inc. Scream Arena is not a game which appealed to our family."
1,Far and Beyond the Worst!,"This is easily the worst game I have ever played - (...) There is no plot, only a succession of increasily disapointing ""games"". It is challenging only on a sesame street level. If you buy this, make sure it's for a three year old!"
2,Not NTSC as advertised. Did us no good,No good for us Just as expected .... Zzz z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z
3,Another hard to find CD,"The FANIA ""HABANA JAM"" is a good CD, my favorite part is Pete ""EL CONDE"" Rodriguez singing ""MENEAME LA CUNA."" The sound is low, but hopefully this may be REMASTERED some day for better or louder sound quality."
4,Great for converts,Being a Roman Catholic convert I was never before introduced to the Rosary. A friend gave me this book and it helped me understand it's beginnings and it's current value. The writer is easy to follow and very informative. I have since bought several of the books and shared them with both my Catholic and non Catholic friends. I recommend you do the same.
4,Bill Connors' Escape from Forever,"I'm still waiting to get ahold of the cd version of this, but that's okay, the exquisite ECM vinyl that I rely on still delivers the goods: If you've heard Connors' prior ECM solo recording Theme to the Gaurdian, then you'll have some idea; Swimming was recorded in 1979, about 5 years after Connors left Return to Forever and went acoustic, performing rarely and woodshedding extensively in his Brooklyn loft. Although he had been playing lots of classical guitar during the late '70's, Swimming features acoustic steel-string, sometimes with one melody line over-dubbed on top of the chord progressions, which are often reminscent of Ralph Towner's composing, without the rhythmic drive which Towner usually has on display. Here on Swimming, the performances are often devoid of a discernable beat; rather meandering, but moody & beautiful."
5,still swimming ...,"I first heard the album right when it was released ,having been turned on to ""theme to the guardian"" roughly three years earlier. In stark contrast to the guitar scene at the time the quiet melody and detached rhythms spoke volumes aboutthe ""ambient"" possibilties of solo acoustic guitar.Not over the top virtuosity but reflective,thoughtful,genuine music.The compositions and arrangments have a depth that like most great records reveal new imagery with repeat listeningsthe album was recorded by the unhearlded Jan Erik Kongshaug who brings an audiophile quality to it .As relevent now if not more so in our ""got to have it now"" world""Swimming with.."" causes you stop and think about what it is you've gotten yourself into and how that experience mightinfluence the future for the positive.""Swimming with .. ""is one of my 10 favorite recordings."
5,The Real Thing,I'm from the south and these are the real thing. Try them with Black Eyed Peas. Just had them for the New Year. Great with sandwiches also.
5,Simply great.,"Being from New England I have known of watermelon pickle since I was knee high to a grasshopper. Then I moved to Texas and had a dickens of a time finding it anywhere. Once in a while the stores would carry it, but it wasn't common.Then I found this item on Amazon.com and took a shot based on the other reviews.All I can say is that this is I will be ordering it again."
1,What a sham,Adi Da makes a lot of hay in his countless books about a letter Swami Muktananda wrote that supposedly authorized Adi Duh as a spiritual teacher. But he rarely mentions a face-to-face encounter he had with Muktananda later where Muktananda basically referred to him as a low-level sham artist.
4,Good stuff,"Except for a couple of cuts where the rhythm gets iffy, this is hot stuff from beginning to end. I listen to all of the ""old"" referenced bands; it's worth pointing out that the production on this CD is loads better than, say, Naked Raygun or Stiff Little Fingers (or the Sex Pistols, for that matter). There's no loss of rawness or urgency whatsoever, though, which is what's missing from latter-day punks much of the time. No sense of just going through the motions, like I get with Rancid.I have to mention that I found it weird that the singer seems to get his ""r's"" right on about 2/3 of the cuts, and only sporadically on the rest. I think that's where some of the reviewers get their ""British accent"" stuff, but it's ""Tewowist,"" not ""Tehroarist."" Adds to the ""can-do"" ambience, for me."
2,"Oh, please","A qualifier.. it's been said many times 'if you like old school punk, you'll like the explosion' but it's more like if you aren't picky about inane lyrics that are kinda funny because they appear to have been crafted to sound 'punk' by a gang of little boys. It sounds more like they're having a temper tantrum than an explosion. An embarrassment to punk."
4,"Funny, but not new...","I love Flashman. This series of books is the funniest saga ever. Bawdy in places, but laugh-out-loud funny.Mountain of Light was no exception - comical, thrilling (Flashman's only ever one blink away from discovery, followed by a horrible death of which he is characteristically terrified) and very lewd.Having said that, Mountain of Light was no exception. I feel like I've read most of it before, and the novelty of the series is wearing off. (However, I have read about 8 of these now - if you've only read one or two, read another!)"
3,Informative & Fun!,"I must say that I was quite pleased to receive this book so quickly, which was in the ""Nick of time"" for Christmas! My youngest children enjoyed the story, but I think the fact that it focused on the library classification system made it not quite as interesting for casual reading.I am going to donate this book to my daughter's kindergarten teacher or school media specialist. I feel that it is an excellent teaching story of the library and how it is organized, and it makes this somewhat dull topic fun. The fact that it comes with lesson plans makes it that much better for the elementary classroom."
3,OK but not what I thought I was receiving,"This ""The Shelf Elf"" was really not the book I thought I was getting so I was disappointed in that way."
3,Mere mycorrhiza,"This is a technical-scientific book on mycorrhiza, especially mycorrhizal ecology. Recent breakthroughs in research are recorded. Typical chapter headings: ""Foraging and resource allocation strategies of mycorrhizal fungi in a patchy environment"", ""Genetic studies of the structure and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities"", ""Mycorrhizal specificity and function in myco-heterotrophic plants"". Get it? I know what mycorrhiza is, of course. Come on, every child who reads books on mushrooms knows *that*. However, something tells me this book isn't ""mere mycorrhiza"", but goes much deeper. All the way to the roots?I feel left out, ha ha."
4,30 minutes of sports like moves,"This video consists of 3 segments, based on in-line skating, martial arts, and ballet. Rather than a 'buns' workout, I felt it really works my legs, especially inner thighs. I don't really feel like the in-line skating section is a challenge, but the martial arts and ballet sections make you work. I think this is a great lower body work out, with adequate warm up and cool down. (30 minutes long)Instructor comments: Robin leads this one. She and the other girls are really peppy and keep you motivated; you can tell she is really into the work out. If you can't handle peppiness and smiley happy instructors, don't bother!"
4,"Overall, a Good Workout","I LOVE that it is only 30 minutes long! Exercising has never been a joy for me. Getting noticable results from a short workout is a big plus! I agree with other people about the static bar on the bottom of the screen, it just won't go away. Other than that it's a decent tape. It dosen't make you feel like checking the clock to see when the torture will be over. It quickly produces muscle definition, unlike some other tapes. I give it four stars because of the static."
3,Hair of Steel!,"This workout tape featured the most obnoxious instructor in the entire world. When she started singing ""buns on sunshine"" along with Katrina and the Waves' ""Walking on Sunshine,"" well, it was too much. Her hair is long and sprayed in place--it does not move during the course of the workout. And she's ""all about"" being YOUR friend. The music is better than the original ""Buns"" series, and the moves, if you hate floor work, are okay. She's found five great moves, and you will do them over and over during this workout. It makes you appreciate Tamilee and the original series."
1,Rubbish,"Thankfully, I only ""rented"" this bit of garbage through Netflix. Audio and video are about the quality you'd expect to record with a cell phone. No, check that. Cell phones are actually better. Even if you haven't read the reviews here, you quickly get the sense that the band had nothing to do with this ""project"". Terrible production quality, and only a patch work quilt of band material. The only part that's credibly done (in terms of production quality) are the ""interviews"" by a series of music critics. Absolute garbage."
3,genesis the gabriel era,"I was excited to receive this beautifully packaged DVD -It has alot of ancient video clips that are must haves for the true Genesis fan. I am glad that I got it. That being said, if you are looking for awesome clear video with great sound of full live song performances, don't even think about buying this video ! you will be infuriated with the lack therof ; Unfortunately, this simply does not exist for the early Genesis years -shame!"
1,Worthless-a waste of money,"I went all out and bought this pre-treatment as well as the anti icky-poo. A lot of money, but it was a last resort for our carpet versus our beloved cat.I also own a professional steam cleaner like the ones you rent, and followed the instructions to a ""tee"". It had no effect. The smell was still there; though not as bad, but our cat could still smell the spots without a problem.Just a waste of money in my opinion."
4,Yet another decent old-school black metal album fro Abyss.,"Just like their other album, pick this up if you're into the old-fashioned blast-beat black metal stuff from before Dimmu Borgir. This is fast, raw and agressive, though don't expect anything like Hypocrisy or PAIN."
3,Svart Mettal frn Sverige,Hypocrisy guys playing black metal...hmm. Avarage stuff from these guys. Sound of the CD is good but no wonder because it's Peter Tägtren and Abyss studios. Best songs of the record are Psycomantum and Sorgens Dal. 8 songs and only 29.17. this should be MCD instead of an album. Well Slayer's Reign In Blood is also really short and it's classic. This just is not. Still it's ok album.
1,useless,"This is not a dictionary by any stretch of the imagination. It is about 200 pages long and all it contains are little summaries of people who appear in the plays. It will also tell you what ""act"" or ""scene"" means, but never tackles the countless words that appear in Shakespeare which the modern reader doesn't have a clue about...at least I don't.And Amazon is charging a $100 for this silliness."
2,Look elsewhere....,"I'm not sure who this book is targeting. This criticism applies to not just to this book but many OS-specific system administration books. I don't believe this book should waste the reader's time with tutorial instructions to shell programming and explaining the use of basic unix commands for which the man pages are more than sufficient.If you are new to system administration in general I recommend that you pick of a copy of Frisch's Essential System Administration. This is the best introduction to unix system administration. If you are experienced with unix adminstration and wish to learn more about administering Solaris, read the online Solaris adminstration collection publish by Sun: the documentation there is better than you'll find in any Solaris administration book."
2,Sound is off,This CD sounds as if it is a reproduction of a reproduction. The tones and voices are very weak.
3,A classic to have if you are a rock and roll listener,"Original recording, could get a better rating with remastering. A good one to have if you like classic rock and roll."
5,A nice tiny tool ...,"What is there to say about Vise Grips, except that they rock. This tiny pair is perfect to keep in my briefcase for those times when you don't have the right tool, but don't want to make a trip out to the truck to get it. I have Vise Grips in almost every size they make, and they have been lifesavers time and time again. Don't buy the knockoffs though ... spend the extra money and get the originals!"
2,Chinese Junk,Won't last long. Mine won't close on small objects anymore. Spend the 3 extra dollars and buy some American Klein Lok 10410 pliers.
2,Mis-aligned jaws,"First off, Amazon is the greatest, and they are always my first on-line location for purchases. Purchased these small vice grips for a project working with small devices. The first attempt at use yielded two screw heads being scratched/messed up due to the vice grips continually slipping off the screws. I carefully looked at the jaws of the vice grips and immediately saw that they are mis-aligned from the factory - it looks like they are molded improperly. Irwin - that is bad, bad, bad; unacceptable, no excuse. Amazon - my guess is all the 4WRs have mis-aligned jaws."
5,little jaws big preformance,only one thing to say about this little guy excellent performance unmatched this is the real deal when your looking for this size.
2,Not up to par - DVD wise.,"This movie is the original of the re-released version known as Red River Valley, a VHS copy of which I have. This DVD is of medium quality as it appears to have been made not from a film print but from a VHS tape. The double shadows and ghost effects are obvious. MY Goodtimes EP mode VHS copy was far better than this."
5,such a pity,"I bought ""Grace"" after his death. I read the bad news in a magazine and got curious. I have to say I didn't turn fan immediately but I more or less rediscovered his music a year ago. Since then I listened to grace almost every day. The song grace is my favourite all time song. This CD is absolutely fantastic. I especially enjoyed listening to the songs I never heard. ""Dream brother"", ""What will you say"" and ""Grace"" are the standouts.""Eternal life"", Lilac wine"" and ""the man that got away"" are a little dissapointing but the three songs on the bonus-CD are terrific again. Actually this CD is worth 4.5 stars."
2,"Good energy, only 1 standout track","This is the only stuff I've ever heard by Buckley. I bought this CD after hearing ""I Woke Up in a Strange Place (Live)"" on Pandora. Definitely a great track. Other reviewers were right, the sound quality on this CD is good and most of the tunes are intriguing. Still, nothing really grabbed me. I'm gonna try the ""Olympia"" recordings and hope they deliver as promised by other reviewers."
4,Proof of a magical performer,"I adore Jeff Buckley, he was truely an amazing muscial performer on all counts. This live collection is quite grand throughout, and really gives us a snapsnot of what could have been. The sound is overall very good, the dynamics of his songs sometimes require some knob turning during the quiet parts, but don't let that keep you from this disc. Those not entirely familar with his work should start with the disc, ""Grace"".(feel free to check out my review of it) This live CD contains most of that incredible material as well as a few covers. The Smith's, ""I Know it's Over"", is an all-too-sad reminder.If you own a DVD, You might want to pick that up first. That in my book is 5 stars plus! It contains all sorts of bonus footage as well as an entire show recorded in Chicago. Seeing him as well as hearing him is such a treat, it's a must!"
1,NOT FIT AS A LEGACY,"I picked up the cassette of this after not hearing it for several years and realised why it stayed unlistened to for so long. Apart from the encore - Leonard Cohen's Halleluja (I've seen this done live much better by John Cale), this is a total disappointment - mostly self-indulgent and fan-unfriendly . His Grace album is sadly the only decent thing he ever did. Sad."
4,I want more!!,"I want more recordings of Jeff Buckley live!!! This is a wonderful album and we are so lucky to have access to these recordings of Jeff. It's a must have for any Buckley fan. If you are a first time Buckley listener, I might steer clear of this album until you have heard Grace. It's best to be familiar with the studio recordings in order to appreciate the genius of Buckley's live improvisations.I also have to say that this album captures the talent of Buckley's guitar ability - as well as the intuitiveness of his fellow bandmates. Wonderful!"
5,Miss His Voice So Much,"What can say but if you love the music of Jeff Buckley then you'll love this one. Bought it today, loved it today. For me it's a sad album because he's gone. Sounds corney but it's true. His voice is missed. Buy this one love it and remember."
5,transcendental bliss,"lyrically blurring Reed, Whitley, Waits, Farrell, Drake, Cornell, etc...Vocal capabilities of Freddy Mercury and sonics ranging from a gentle string quartet melody to harmonic mayhem of Hendrix/Zeppelin live (often in the same song)Shakespearean Tragedy brought to Music.Very RAW renditions! Somewhat bleak but still an ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL listen if you like music flowing uncut from the soul of the performer"
3,A chance to once again look back on what could have been,"This live cd is both exhilerating and frustrating at the same time. Exhilerating in a sense that you can hear the magic in Buckley's voice and also in the live performance of not only his classic songs from ""Grace"" but also in his cover of ""Kanga Roo"" by Big Star. Frustrating in the fact that it leaves you shaking your head wondering what could have been. His loss was huge. Unfortunately also frustrating in the fact that the sound is a bit ""muddy"" but understandibly so considering the tracks are soundboard DAT's. It's not enough to deter you from buying this cd it's just enough to stop me from giving the cd four stars. Also, when you hear Jeff sing the line ""I can feel the soil falling over my head"" you will get goose bumps."
2,Mystery White Boy,"I was really excited when i bought this as I have both grace and live at sin-é but this was very dissapointing. 'Dream Brother' and 'Mojo Pin' are good but i found 'Hallelujah' pretty poor. He sings in this wierd tone like he's had anaesthetic injected into his mouth. Don't get me wrong, I'm as big a Buckley fan as anyone but steer clear of this, by far not his best live performances."
2,"Great shirt, horrible service","I bought this shirt about 2 wks ago and got a shirt yesterday, but it was not this shirt. Instead, I received a red shirt with a black star on it, saying ""The Clash"". Usually I don't like returning shirts, but this shirt was an obnoxious candy red. So, I returned the shirt only to be put off another 3 wks for the real shirt; which, in fact, came 4 wks after my son's birthday. In conclusion, be aware that this company is substandard in service."
5,"Amazing Smell, Awesome Sound","Our friend has this candle, it is amazing. It makes her entire house smell like freshly baked pancakes with syrup, and after we leave, we still smell it on us for a while. The smell doesn't get stale, or overly sweet, just nice. The sound too is a bonus, it has a nice crakling sound when it's quiet, but if you are trying to watch TV, or listen to music it isn't too loud or distracting. I can't wait to try the other scents."
1,Trickery,"seller has a pic of a 22oz candle when it is a 10oz. Don't bee fooled, but it at the store for the same price and get what you pay for."
3,Eh...,"That ""eh"" wasn't any type of the Canadian ""eh"" noises Will and Ian Ferguson describe in How To Be A Canadian, which is a much, much funnier book. Happiness was an OK read. Not fabulous, but not indigestible either. Just... eh. I think Will Ferguson should just stick to nonfiction."
4,Proof of what I've always suspected.,"Well, it had to happen sooner or later (didn't it?). With the onslaught of self-help books on the market, I've always wondered what would happen if one actually worked! Will Ferguson's novel HAPPINESS has showed the world the shattering consequences of just such a feat. Written with a scathing wit, totally merciless in portrayal of both the characters and the industry in which they inhabit, and a sort of ""Oh my GOD"" sense of unavoidable peril, the book is a delight to read and an utter horror to contemplate. The added bonus being, of course, that it's always wonderful to discover a new author, especially one with other works to delve into. I am looking forward to Mr. Fergusons other offerings."
3,"With a whimper, not a bang","What if self-help books really worked? More specifically, what if one self-help book came along that fixed everything? That's the premise of Will Ferguson's comedic novel, Happiness TM, and it works. To a point.Writers, editors and others involved in the publishing world will experience particular delight in Ferguson's barbed assault on the industry, and the first half of the book is generally wonderful fun. Unfortunately, like too many other examples of humorous fiction, the hilarity peters out well before the end of the story and one exits the final chapter vaguely disappointed. (c.f. my review of Zanesville: A Novel, by Kris Saknussemm)."
4,Happiness Debunked,"A humorous and cleverly written book, whose simple message is that Happiness is not Happiness at all. We need imperfections and valleys to contrast those divine moments on the mountains! Comforting stuff, and a reminded that all experiences are good for us and enhance our lives in some way. Constant happiness would be insipid and boring in this life and therefore by definition unachievable."
1,The lighter side of happiness,"Dissapointing. I was bored of reading always the same: the great menace of the Tupak Soiree book. Ok! I knew it already! Tell me something more, like a good history."
4,Fun!,"A funny story. I love the sarcasm, and I took great delight in the presentation of the workings of a publishing world. I recommend this particularly to anyone who's ever tried to partake of some aspect of the joys of publishing (writers, editors, copy-editors, interns...). Or to people who love mocking self-help books."
2,2 stars for great premise and wit; 0 stars for ending!!!!,"Ok, the book was funny at some parts, annoying at others. While the premise was cleverly set up, seemingly to gather steam and roll towards a rollickin' good end, the ending was way too much of a let down with huge chunks of dialogue as exposition that went on and on and on. It was disappointing. Here, the author was setting up some end-of-the-world scenario with a scary book and its mysteriously evil author as its villain, only to reveal.... Groan! Again I say, without giving away the ending, that the ending was miserable. Truly, the ending was so pathetic as to not make the read of the first 4/5s of the book worth it. While Mr.Ferguson does write with a sure hand, he sure runs out of creativity in the crucial final act. Unfortunatey so.I feel cheated!"
4,"Great CD, but just one thing missing","If you've seen Joel live, you'll love this CD. All the classics are here and the sound is fantastic. You can hear the crowd singing along on several numbers which just adds to the overall ""live"" effect.The biggest disappointment however is the omission of Joels' signature song ""Piano Man"". As most Joel fans can attest, this song played live is one massive sing-along. Not including it is sacrilige. If you want that one song live, you'll have to buy the Joel boxset, which might have been part of the reason.With over 2 hours of hits such as My Life, Only the Good Die Young, and Scenes from an Italian Restaurant; this CD is a can't miss."
4,WHAT IS WRONG WITH A LIVE RECORDING? THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"after defending live concerts( see) "" neil diamonds greatest hits""s"" along comes this travesty how the editors that cut good songs out of other albums could leave in billy's ragging on and on about ticket prices and his continues use of the word S**T is beyond me? didnt billy himself want these remarks cut? i guess he did not think of his fans enough, to cut them, in place of it he could have installed a cut of ""Piano Man"" wich is missing on this album and kept the album the same amount of time"
3,"OK cd, sony shouldn't have made it so ""pretty""","Overall good quality, but I witnessed the concert LIVE on new years eve. Sony for some reason decided to make MAJOR changes in lots of the songs despite the fact that this is a LIVE album. I dont belive that I can ""re-live"" the night as sony clamed, this album is a ""bad"" copy of the night, not a clear copy."
4,Billy Joel Rocks In the New Millennium!,"I was really impressed when I heard this live CD set. The sound quality is exceptional. The only letdowns are 1. He didn't do ""Piano Man!"" and 2. He did do ""Honky Tonk Women!""; I guess just because the song does mention ""New York City"" He probably just wanted to continue to emphasize that New York was ""the center of the universe"" that New Millennium's Eve. I love the track ""2000 Years"" and every track on CD1. This 2 CD set is well worth the money!"
3,Poor reproduction since I was there,"As a person who was blessed enough to be at the best event of the Millenium, I am shocked at how poorly this CD was produced. They cut ""Miami 2017,"" ""Piano Man,"" a cover of, ""Purple Haze,"" and many more. Billy Joel playing these songs created the best three hours of live music I have ever seen, and this CD is gross misrepresentation of that."
4,Billy Joel is the greatest,"I went to the NYE concert, it was great. The one thing that i am disapointed in was the lacking of the songs miami 2017,Piano man and soviner. nothing is like the live pianoman with 60,000 people singing along its the greatest"
5,Great Melodic Album,"In Flames is the modern version of Iron Maiden. While their singing part is not as good, the riffs, and especially solos are quite amazing. A MUST HAVE for metal fans"
5,One of Death Metal's most Important Links,"Actually, just referring to this album as simply Death Metal is not nearly enough. After the underground successes of ""Lunar Strain"" and ""Subterranean"" (also great albums) They reached their apex with Jester Race. It starts out with the nice acoustic melodies of ""moonshield"" which is considered my many their best song they ever did. The riffs in this song will hook you immediately. After that comes the nice instrumental ""The Jesters Dance"" which is a nice transition to the next song ""Artifacts of the Black Rain"" which has some riffs that you'll never forget. Later on is the title track, which has an amazing intro. The other instrumental song is ""Wayfearer"" which I think is a quite emotional song, even without lyrics. (is that possible?) the melodies in that song are very well written.Well if you are looking for some good melodic death metal this is one of the best choices to make. go pick it up ASAP."
1,This album stinks like buttface...,I though this album was much worse than all the rest because is stuck like pee pee.
3,Clay cooking,"This book has a lot of recipes, but only a few that I would be interested in using. I would recommend rather that you track down a copy of the Sales Clay-Pot Cookbook. That's the bad news. The good news is that if you like tasty food that's easy to prepare, you definitely want to get some clay pots to cook with. You could use this book to grasp the concept of claypot cooking and go from there."
4,clay pot cooking,"very nice book. nicely illustrated and recipes easy to follow. received free with the purchase of a romertopf clay pot.however, if you plan to purchase a cookbook, georgia sales' ""clay pot cook book"" is a much better choice in my opinion, and has stood the test of time having been written over 30 years ago and is still around."
2,Perhaps not the best buy....,"This cookbook will do for cooking times and method, but the recipes are uninspired. And very limited in scope and number."
2,Not the best clay pot cooking cookbook,"This clay pot cooking cookbook has limited recipes. For the recipe I did try, the time indicated was not adequate to cook the food in the clay pot."
2,not your meat and potatoes kind of cookbook,"I was looking for a Claypot cookbook with simple recipes. If you do not mind spending time putting together several ingredients, then you may like this book. I am not impressed."
2,Not for younger kids,"I bought this for my 7 year old's birthday along with the movie Matilda. She loved Matilda, but only made it through about 30 minutes of this one. This just doesn't hold the attention of younger kids. We'll have to hold on to it until she is older."
3,i like it enough to buy it,"Hi there. I have brought the vhs of this movie, and I like it enough to rebuy it and upgrade to dvd. I haven't read the book first, but I've heard it wasn't exactly true to the book, however the actors are fitting and I love maggie smith in any movie I've seen. The graphics and growing of the garden is fantastic. It's definately worth watching anyway though, and it makes me want to read the book of this. :-D pianist@shaw.ca"
4,Great Childrens story,Secret Garden:It's a very good version from the old classic. I would recommend this to everyone. I like it very much.
2,A Grand Production,"The acting, and the costumes in this movie were great. The Manor was too dark and dirty, the garden looks like ""a gardener's garden"" in the book, Mary said she didn't want it to look like that. There are too many differences between book and film, for me to give it more than two stars. I don't see WHY this movie was made such a BIG fuss over. It was mainly a grand, meaning expensive, production."
4,excellent movie,I watched it with my 8 year old grandaughter and loved it and want to share it with my other girls.
2,SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOK!!,"After reading the reviews I was hopeful, but my son and I watched this after he finished reading (and loved) the book and were quite disappointed. Significant differences include: how the parents die, Medlock's character (added ""drama"" - including job resignation - to her role), HOW SARAH FINDS THE KEY!!, added ""romance"" between Sarah and both boys that is unnecessary and not in the book, a nighttime fire scene, HOW COLIN MEETS HIS FATHER, added Sarah ""drama"" (""No one wants me!"") at the end that was wholly unnecessary. The movie is beautiful to watch, but if you have read the book the differences are really disappointing and completely unnecessary."
1,DVD The Secret Garden,"UNUSABLE because:It was area coded 1 for USA etc.You shipped it to me in AUSTRALIA which required Area code 4.Why was I not informed that it would not work ?Returning it would have been too expensive, and I found another source."
3,wrong movie,The DVD was sealed in the right case but it was the wrong movie. I was expecting the Secret Garden and got The Little Princess! I kept watching it and it did involve three children but no garden!
3,Nice Try,I didnt like it. It was not true to the book wich is wonderful.They left out when Mary was in India completely and they interpret the magic Mary and Colin are always talking about all wrong. Also Mary didnt get locked in her room at all. It was a poor job and a great disapointment.
3,"Visually stunning, excellent ac; but not a 5 for Christians.","A simply marvelous, visually stunning and heart warming and charming story; complete with excellent music scores. The young Kate Maberly shows an enormous amount of depth in her leading role as Mary Lennox. Andrew Knott was very good in his supporting role as Dickon.All other actors were very good and believable. That being said it is a very dangerous film for a Christian, as it needlessly subtedly plants New Age philosophy which honors the creation (nature) and makes no mention of the Creator.What I am referring to is the scene of the children dancing around the fire in the garden and calling out to some unknown pagan god, and the movies' overall theme of a magical garden - due entirely to nature.I'd give it five stars except for these important misleading characteristics."
5,"Lyrical, the best adaptation overall, and a great kid's movie","A very, very good movie. The Secret Garden was one of my favourite books as a child-I read it over and over-and while this movie still isn't really the book it's a good adaptation and a great kids-and-adults movie in it's own right. Mary Lennox, the spoiled, neglected child of wealthy English parents living in India, goes to live with her uncle in an isolated part of England after her parents die of a fever. There, left to her own devices, she discovers an invalid and fascinating cousin and a mysterious garden which she slowly brings back to life, slowly coming back to life and growing along with it. A very unusual and crafted film, this is one kid's movie that's handled with great cimatography and great performances from the stars, thus producing a great and very enjoyable children's movie."
5,Classic,This was one of my favorite movies as a child. It's a touching story that is a perfect family movie appropriate for all ages.
5,Still A Secret,"There is always a place you want to call your own. In this film adaptation of a beloved children's classic, that place is a garden hidden away on the estate of a bitter widower and his sickly son. With the arrival of a young orphan to the estate, the long neglected garden becomes the sanctuary for the young orphan and soon her care of the garden brings new life to those around her. Beautifully filmed and acted. The garden appears magical and as scenic as any pastoral painting."
2,Going Through the Motions,It felt like the film did not have sufficient time to develope the relationships which are at the core of the book.
4,A great family movie,"I enjoyed this movie; it's been many years since i read the book it is based on, but I didn't feel lost at all while watching it.An orphaned girl is moved from India, to the forbidding English manor her uncle lives in. She is made to entertain herself and stumbles on a hidden garden and a crippled cousin.This movie is totally safe to watch with young children.My one complaint is that the development of the characters happens so quickly in the movie."
3,secret garden,"it was an alright movie although a lot of details were innacurate with the book, but I suppose that is to be expected with a movie made from a book."
5,The Secret Garden,"This was for my 7-year old granddaughter. She loved the move and also the book!Marilyn FitzgeraldCarlsbad, CA"
5,The Secret Garden,I enjoyed this movie. It is a great movie for kids. What a wonderful story. It's about a young boy who lose's his mother and he is in a wheel chair. The kids take him to the Secret Garden and that's where the fun begins. It was nice to see this little boy walk after being told that he never could go outside or ever walk again. His Dad comes home and they take him to the garden and then the son shows his father how he has learned how to walk again thanks to the garden.
5,Secret Garden,"This movie is a classic. I have loved it for years. My daughter has it , and I just recently bought her The Return To Secret Garden, also I bought her both the books. Great Movie.Also buying it from Amazon was great. I could not buy it from DVD Empire because it was no longer in stock."
5,Classic Movie,"A very good family movie. A beautiful movie that is good for young and old. Emotionally riveting, with great performances."
5,The Secret Garden DVD,"I saw this movie long ago and thought it was a very good film. I felt it conveyed a good message about life and that there was a good lesson to learn from their characters. I thought it was a great pre-teen movie, so I ordered it for my granddaughter, who is 9 years old. She loves it."
5,Smartest family movie,"The Secret Garden doesn't paint children as you've come to expect in a movie. Agnieszka Holland directs these children as brilliant and poetically sad. Kate Maberly as Mary Lennox is enchantingly Sensible. The music is sad and the story transforms with everything that lives. Nature and Youth blossoming together. It was like reading a cherished book. You run through so many personal emotions. I recommendA Little PrincessandFinding Neverland (Widescreen Edition).There is a sad, somber reality to this magnificent film, but it makes the ending all the more better to enjoy. You savor the moments of happiness in the gray film. When the colors come to life, when the children shrill with laughter, you share in those purified moments of happiness.I cannot remember a film so effective in its use of music, charm, cleverness, and story telling. It is a classic movie that deserves serious attention and admiration. This movie is not simple loved, but beloved by its appreciators."
5,An utterly breathtaking film for all ages.,"I saw this movie when I was in elementary school and loved the character of Mary, I relished in the classic story from the children's book, and I begged my mom to purchase the video. To this day I still watch that movie, with every viewing more intrigued. The music is haunting, the landscape eerie and beautiful, and the acting superb. I still marvel at this film and only wished it was more celebrated. Adults and children will enjoy this classic film."
5,No Secret That I Love It,"I've watched this movie more times than I can count. The only thing that baffled me was: If this kid was supposed to be so sick, why wasn't there a doctor in the house? However, it doesn't matter. Great movie for the entire family."
4,"Weird experience, but love the movie!","I was in the mood to see this movie again and was super excited for its arrival. I took off the plastic and put the DVD in without looking at it. When I turned it on, the menu for ""A Little Princess"" was on my screen. The wrong DVD was actually in the ""The Secret Garden"" box, wrapped in plastic and everything. I was able to send it back and have it replaced. However, it was a lot of inconvenience for an inexpensive movie I could have bought at Wal-Mart."
4,Real Life Magic,"A wonderful adaptation of a classic story, this movie is beautifully filmed. A great addition to any collection of children's movies. I enjoyed this as a child and still enjoyed seeing it again as an adult."
2,secrets,i liked this movie until they brought spiritism into it. i would not recomend it because of that and no longer have the movie.
3,"Beautifuly done but ""creative"" with the plot","This is a beautiful film, there is absolutely no denying that. It is also exceptionally well cast: Mary's transformation from sour little brat to glowing wee lass is completely believable, and the bratty, dour Colin makes a perfect ""to the manor born"" invalid. My only problem is the liberties taken with the plot.Having the parents die in an earthquake while Mary is watching is a needless, though minor liberty (though it does mean that the touching line about ""there's no one left to come"" must be left out). But there was no need to change the plot to make the housekeeper (a wasted Maggie Smith) evil, and the chanting around the campfire is just weird.The movie is worth watching for the scenery alone, but make sure that you read the book first. It is much better."
5,Secret Garden DVD,"This is a great story, one of my favorites. My grandson and I really enjoyed watching this version. Very entertaining"
4,Cool....,"This Cd is very nice! I just loved it! even tough it have some boring songs, i really enjoyed, and i would recomend to everyone!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Another Eric Van Lustbader book that pulls an American character - in this case, two of them - into the depths of Asia. In this case, because of the death of some of their relatives.At the heart of the matter is a search for some supposdedly mystical artificats, that some Indochinese druglords value highly. Therefore, this is where a lot of the book will end up."
1,Boring Woman Tells Boring Story,"As I read this book, I kept thinking it would get exciting, eventually take off....but it never did. Linda is so ordinary...I wanted to scream...I love colorful, quirky, interesting people...She's as drab as a worn eraser. I could imagine seeing her on a reality TV show..answering the question..what have you that's unique, interesting? The answer a long ""duh"".....Why is it that the eternally boring and clueless become therapists? Misery loves company??? Linda never came to the conclusion ""what have I to offer""...instead it's always me! me! me! like a three-year-old. Courtney had a twisted father and a wimpy mother..I didn't realize what an exciting person I was til I read her book....If I wrote my memoir it would floor you....but I don't want the numerous miscreants I know...to come gunning for me...I'd like to live a bit longer.."
1,The Unkindest Cut,"Linda Carroll plainly had self interest motivating her to write this book. It is incomprehensible how any decent mother could write the things she does about her daughter. She obviously wants a forum to dispute what has been written about her as Courtney's mother. I'm not a fan of Courtney Love and I've read nothing about Carroll until now. Poor Courtney! Linda Carroll, in trying to justify her mothering, only proves how bad it was. Other reviewers have commented that they don't understand why people are reviewing Carroll's behavior instead of her writing. But since she is writing about her behavior, I think it's fair that both are commented upon. Her writing is fair and her behavior appalling."
1,This is as horrible of a book as she is a mother,Can I just say that I'm disgusted that this book evens exist. I think it is completely ridiculous that she found the need to write a book justifying her being a bad mother. This book is poorly written and quite frankly sad. It breaks my heart to think about what Courtney Love was put through as a child by her parents. And if you are looking for a good book on her check out Queen OF Noise or Courtney Love : The untold story. But this book? It's a waste of time and money. It wouldn't be so bad if she knew how to write or tell a story. But she spends the whole time making excuses for bad parenting instead of owning it. Don't waste your time.
4,"Interesting Read - a review of ""Her Mother's Daughter""","I picked up this book because I heard a short blurb about it somewhere (perhaps NPR or CNN?) and I was keenly interested in the take a therapist might take on their dysfunctional family history.I never suspected that the book would be so well written, nor so clever in it's presentation. Using scenes from the past (without psycho-analysis btw) you are moved forward in history in an unhurried manor and end up at a present that seems very logically arrived at.Four Stars. Fascinating read. Well written. An interesting look at a time in American history that is frequently recalled in glowing terms. [So much for that] What you really find is that life then, as now, can be very complicatedCourtney fans, should there be any, will find out some interesting facts such as that she was a precocious child; walking early and using short sentences at only 12 month of age."
5,Who cares?,"Reading the reviews it seems the review section is being used to judge either Linda Carroll or Courtney Love. Is that the point of a book review?The book is a splendid read.Few people have the courage to tell the truth about themselves in such an open way.I wonder what kind of memoir some of these readers(and writers) would deliver were they to talk about themselves in such a candid way.The point here is to review a book, not a persons character.The book kept me going from 7PM until 3 in the morning, when I finished it. Thats a five star review. I thought about it most of the day,about how Linda started her life and how she persisted until she found a better life for herself.I never realized how adoption affects people, especially when it is never spoken about except in a hush-hush way. Many of us wish we were adopted, but this shows the other side of the fence.I will recommend this to my book club, it has given me so much to think about."
1,Sad excuse for a Mother and a Therapist...,"Sadly, my own family has been ""taken in"" by this very poor excuse for a ""therapist"" and a mother. It is tragic that such damaged people are licensed to practice therapy on other people's problems when they have so poorly managed to conduct their own lives and help shape the lives of their own children. Linda Carroll opened herself up to criticism when she decided to justify her own personal actions with such a visibly emotionally distrubed child. ""Physician heal thyself..."" Don't bother to read this book, isn't her child Courtney sad enough to get the picture!"
2,This could have been a great album,"What is with the echo??? It is terrible. However, the music is great. It really upsets me. I saw them open for Pearl Jam and I thought the echo in the mic was a bad sound system, but when I listened to the album I realized he did this on purpose. Why?It could have been great."
3,Lo Fi,Produced/Mixed in an annoying fuzzy echo that I think is meantto cover the vocal mediocrity.Some good songs but I have to turn it off after listening toa couple.
1,Not so great!,"I really wanted this cd because I love the song ""Golden,"" and I thought at the rest of the album must be at least passable. So it was surprising to hear how bad the rest of the songs are, mostly due to the gimmicky ""echo chamber"" sound to all of them. ""Golden"" is so different from the rest that it seems like it was done by another band altogether. A big disappointment! Sorry, but that's my opinion. . ."
5,It Still moves will move you,"My Morning Jacket does it again and again and again, tweaking their sound to accomodate my A.D.D. ears. I love these guys and this CD is no exception, their jams are so tight and rehearsed, I want to see them in concert sooooooo bad."
5,can't get enough of this band.,"reverb drenched guitar, a big sound worthy of neil young's crazy horse band, i can't get enough of these guys. if you haven't heard them, you need to. as fast as you can. a rock band with melodies and riffs and a haunting sound, this is a great album."
4,"still listening to it, to get the full effect","after hearing the song ""golden"" i was totally taken to this group, the singing is unique and as genuine as the instrument playing, if you like country with a twist of pop alternative style i think you will like this group, and i can't wait to buy more of their collection"
5,Beautiful,I would highly recommend the latest from My Morning Jacket. I think it's one of the best releases in 2003.
2,Disappointed,"Listened to once or twice...haven't touched since. I am not impressed, and frankly, disappointed."
3,A step back?,"This is by no means a bad album, but It Still Moves is not the of the same world that produced the outstanding ""At Dawn."" At Dawn lives in a world populated by only My Morning Jacket. A moody, sometimes sad, sometimes uplifting work of brilliance. It still Moves lives in a world where, unlike that of At dawn, you can make comparisons. You can categorize it. It is classic rock, in the land of Skynyrd, and the Allman Brothers. What, to me, was special about MMJ was that you couldn't categorize them. No more. A nice listen, but the revelation is gone."
3,"great vibe, but the sound......","I continue to enjoy this album, the songs have a complexity about them that I find with each listen. Good range of vibe, from a rocking opener with decent guitar range, to a slow folksy/country feel that is perfect for a cold rainy evening. My only issue is the recording quality, almost sounds like its a live recording. I can tell they want an echo feel with the vocals, but it makes the guitar/drums fall back as well, very strange. Its raw and you get used to it after several listens, but why struggle? Can't tell if this is for an effect or the nature of the equipment, but a cleaner/tighter sound recording would make this a 4-star."
5,Great album to listen and ponder to ...,"My listening habits range from My Bloody Valentine to Neil Young to Iggy Pop .. a fairly wide range of music genres. With that said, I must say that this band is a like a breath of fresh air. Their music is inherently southern country (emphasis on the COUNTRY) rock. If you can't appreciate the twanginess of Uncle Tupelo, Allman Brothers or Neil Young -- Do not buy this album. However, should you be looking for something different this side of alternative. This album will suit you just fine."
4,Like a nice old jacket.,"This is a disc I picked up because it's the only one I've heard called ""Album Of The Year"", other than The White Stripes ""Elephant"". After a few listens, it almost lives up to it's hype. I'd say between the singing, and the country-rock feel, it reminds me most of ""Neil Young"". But some of the music also has a spacy-ness to it, that almost recalls ""The Verve"". ""Master Plan"" sounds like the big single, and ""Golden"" has a catchy guitar part that would make it good for country-cruisin'. ""One Big Holiday"" and ""Just One Thing"" are good as well. Overall, this IS one of the best of the year, and any fan of southern rock, or alt-country should dig it."
1,"Unprecedented crap, useful as penance","This album disappointed me more than any other album I have ever bought. I only heard and read great things about this band, from many reputable sources. After (painfully) listening to this drivel, I am much more careful about recommendations from anyone about anything. It is that bad, that over-hyped. Listen to it and find out for yoursel if you dare. The only reason I gave it one star is because the cover art is quite cool. And the only reason I keep it around is because I bought it right after doing something I shouldn't have done and it appears I was punished immediately with this crap. I wanted to demand a refund from the store for selling me such a horrible ""album,"" but I keep it to (visually only) remind me of my misdeeds and the ever-present wheel of karma."
1,"no, not good at all. quite unlistenable.","it all boils down to whether or not you would enjoy an Allman Brother's coverband with crappy reverb saturated vocals. Obviously, some people think this is a fine thing. I do not. god do I hate this record. Sonically, its just poorly executed and the songcraft is boring. Somehow this band was touted as a fresh indie sound. the sound could not be less fresh. And I don't even dislike the Allman Brothers."
2,I didn't even finish playing it the first time,"I bought this CD because I heard ""Golden"" on a public radio station, and I loved the song, wanted to own it, and wanted to hear more music by this band. Boy, did I waste my money. There is a grand total of three decent songs on this album, and that's being generous. ""Golden"" is excellent and two others are listenable. The rest of the album is pap, it's filler, and this band should not have been given license to put out an entire 70 + minute CD. I couldn't wait for it to be over, and I did something unprecedented in my music-buying history: I didn't finish playing the CD. I stopped the CD halfway through the last song. That's how much I disliked the majority of the tracks. Other reviewers call MMJ's music dark and somber (or synonyms of those adjectives), but overall it had the same effect on me as the sickeningly sweet goo that the dentist uses when he cleans my teeth.I give this album 2 stars out of 5 for ""Golden"" and it alone."
1,listen to more music before you rave about EveryLittleThing,"Im here sitting at my comp. and im looking for artists ""related"" to At The Drive In (a very respectable band mind you) and up pops My Morning Jacket. Before i go any further hear this THEY ARE NOTHING LIKE AT THE DRIVE IN! If you people would like to hear music ""related"" to At The Drive In why don't you check out Snapcase. but if you rather keep listening MMJ be my guest, but please don't dirty the name of A.t.d.i. by comparing them to crap."
2,This won't be helpful ...,"... to you if you're in love with these guys. (Ever noticed how the negative reviews are rarely rated ""helpful""?) I wanted to like this. I bought it because I was disappointed in AT DAWN, and read here and elsewhere that this was better. It's just not. The echoes of Neil Young are unavoidable ... any idiot will notice ... and that's great company, right? Despite that, much of this stuff is baleful, turgid, melancholy and INTERMINABLE. I mean, I can spend all day in a minor key ... but My Morning Jacket's navel-gazing has me ready to blow my brains out. It's all so similar that if it's up your alley, you're gonna love it all ... but me, I enjoy Golden, and can live with Mahgeetah, I Will Sing You Songs, and Steam Engine. That's about it. Sorry."
5,Retro Rocks,"Somebody has been listening to early Neil Young and the Beach Boys by the sound of it. What a great record, full of wearing the influences on the sleeve thing. That is not necessarily bad, as this record is full of really fine music and if you are a fan of '70's stuff before the advent of disco this one's for you. Try any track and you'll get the drift. Top stuff."
4,Early Screaming Trees in some fashion,"Ya know this somehow reminds me of the Screaming Trees when they were coming up. A little Red House painters/Sun Kil-Moon as well. The album is low-fi, perhaps partially reminding me of early Screaming Trees studio efforts."
3,The spirit of 70's southern rock still burns,"Listening to 'It Still Moves' is like being in the country somewhere, waking-up at dawn, and smelling the morning dew. The comparisons to The Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd are a constant, which is almost like a homage to their southern mentors. The haunting/wailing vocals and hazy guitar twang revive 70's country rock, yet My Morning Jacket has a more richer and textured sound. The CD straddles between lush orchestration and intimate ballads, yet always personal, as if you're eavesdropping through a thin veil of mist hovering over a pond. Just think the above mentioned bands mixed in a large cask of oak along with The James Gang, Wilco, The Band, with a touch of The Black Crowes, and released in 2003. The sound is aged and cured just right."
2,Unmoved,"What is all the fuss about this band? They have made several critics' best-of-2003 lists. I bought the album because I liked the leadoff track, ""Mahgeetah"", and my local adult-alternative FM station was touting them highly, and the special-intro price at my local record shop was enticing. Yeah, they are a proficient group instrumentally, and I hear echoes of everyone from Uncle Tupelo to early Neil Young. But that's the primary problem here: ""echoes"". This album is so self-conciously lo-fi, it sounds like it was recorded from the other side of a public rest-room door. The lyrics are all but unintelligible, and the lead singer strains his range throughout the recording. And several songs seem to have a hard time finding their ending. I have to say that, even more than Damien Rice's ""O"", this is the most overrated CD of 2003."
3,Fredrich,FredrichThis book is all about a Jewish boy who is put through tourture just because he's a Jew.He has a very close friend the narrator who is not a Jew.The narrator tries and defends Fredrich from the anti Jews.In the novel there is alot of conflict.In the end i think it is a good book aiming to people at the age of 13+
1,Mahatma Wild Rice / Monica R Abel,"I have used this rice for nearly 20 years. Outstanding product. I suppose it was my fault not reading the quantity in this order. Having purchased before and expecting at least 6 packages of rice, I was very frustrated to see only one. For the price of $6.75 fo one packet. I would say this was a rip off. I will never buy from Monica R Abel again."
1,Save your money.,"Book is way out of date, save your money.Better books to buy with your money. Author talented, but pass on this one."
4,What are you so Grumpy About?,I purchased this book for our church nursery program....they read to the kids that attend the nurseryon Sunday mornings. I think they are enjoying it!
3,What Are You So Grumpy About,"We purchased this book for our 4 year old daughter. I found the book to be somewhat interesting, although it did not hold her attention. The print was cartoonish and it was difficult for her to try and recognize words. It was a great topic but I think that it fell a little short on entertainment."
5,"Short, but amazingly crafted stories and characters","Amazing! Chadwick writes characters/stories in way that is so believable you would think he's just transcribing events that actually occurred.This is my 2nd Concrete purchase and I was even more thrilled with these few short stories than I was with the Concrete: Complete Short Stories that introduced me to the character.The plots are so universal that you never notice that the copyright says 1986, people are people, even in comic book form. Great mysteries abound in each classic tale.They really need to collect all of the published Concrete stories in one volume a la' ""Madman: Gargantua"", it is very deserving."
4,Good loader,"Very good loader. It is not very loud however it stays on the entire time. I put it on a Spyder Xtra for my son and out of 1000 balls he has yet to chop paint. It does take two 9V batteries, so be prepared when you get it. Their is apparently an option to add a control chip to it which I am hoping will turn it into a smarter loader. When you run out of paint it just keeps spinning until you turn it off right now."
2,"not the ""original"" Rainbath any more!","As with some of the other reviewers, I am very disappointed in Neutrogena's decision to change the fragrance of the Rainbath shower gel. I have used Neutrogena and loved the rich, relaxing fragrance for 40 years, since I was a teen. The new fragrance, though billed as ""original"", has a sharper edge, and is not as lush as the REAL original. I am very disappointed in this, and after 40 years of using Neutrogena, I do not plan to buy any more. The new scent is really not that different from many other bath products on the market. I hope Neutrogena reconsiders this. And, regarding one other review speculating that the new scent will not appeal to men, there are many women like me who also do not like it!"
4,Smells Nice,"The bottle opened a bit during shipping, which left a sticky mess. But it wasn't so bad. I really like the way Rainbath smells, and the way my skin feels after my shower."
1,Leakers,My order was 3 40oz bottles. They were wrapped in a soggy mess of celephane and neutrogoo. I washed them off and the bottles were intact - squeezed not broken.
1,Neutropena Face wash,"Scent-free. Doesnt sting my face. Still nice, but harder to find in stock. And it is much more expensive per ounce.How much is your pretty face worth?"
3,disapointed,neutrogena rainbath I never received this you sent me two sesame light oils. I thought I was supposed to get this. but I thought I didn't read it right. But I have tried this product before and do like it and was looking forward to receiving this product. Thank You Denise L. Dubois
1,Worst bike shorts ever,"I bought a pair to try out because they were so cheap. I got what I paid for. The chamois was smaller than other bike shorts and it barely covered my equipment. In addition the chamios was not nearly the thickness and quality of the more popular brands like Pearl Izumi or Cannondale. It that enough bad news? It got worse. When my wife washed them, the black bled into my other clothes. I am amazed that there are people who like these shorts unless I got a factory second. I bought them from the manufacturer on eBay."
2,ouch,"i followed the sizing chart on the page. said i should get a medium according to my waist size. they got here real quick. but they are unbearably tight in the crotch. like, ""ruin your day"" tight. they were cheep and i took a chance, but i think I'll be spending a little more at a bike shop or sporting goods store from now on just so i can try them on first. and I'll probably look at the baggy short style. was planning on just wearing them under a pair of normal cargo shorts (wasn't ready to be ""that guy with the really tight shorts"" yet) but i regret even trying. well, live and learn i guess."
3,Only Good for beginners,"Due to a knee injury, I decided to take up cycling. I was skeptical of the whole idea of bike shorts really helping, so I purchased this inexpensive pair. When I first started doing 8-12 mile rides they were great. The padding was very plush and overall they were really comfortable. However, once I started doing longer rides greater than 20 miles, I found that the padding quickly flattened out. They were good for about 225-250 miles, then they wore out.If you don't plan on biking seriously, but want to improve your comfort these shorts are great (and cheap). However, serious cyclists should look elsewhere."
3,"These shorts are quite functional, but can cause irritation","I like the fit of these shorts better than previous types, but the non-slip material inside the hem of the legs starts to irritate my skin after a while."
2,Look for better shorts on closeout...,"I typically purchase shorts that are under $50 (end of season sales, etc.). I purchased these without knowing much about the brand, but liked the price. The fit and comfort are OK, but the stitching on the leg was poorly done. I would recommend finding a name-brand short on sale for $10 more."
1,Strangle even skinny legs,"It seems no matter what size you buy, they strangle your legs and I have skinny legs! What's with that? I don't know if they try these on actual people before putting them on the market."
2,Mens Pro Bike shorts (red),"The pant properly fits, but then noticed some transparency developed. Beside that the padding does not look like will protect for a long time. Sent it back, they refunded me."
4,"good, solid, bike shorts","These things made a real difference for me. I get saddle rash pretty quickly, and this things enable me to get a good 2 hour ride in without any problems. If you have big thighs (like me) they may be a bit tight, but they stretched out pretty quickly. THe padding is really nice too."
2,No butt cushion,No waist drawstring. Very thin butt pad. No key pocket. If you are a boney ass like me ... buy some thing with a cushion. They do seem well made otherwise.
3,"Men's ""Pro?"" Bike Shorts","I bought these shorts based on the reviews I read here. I wasn't expecting much for the price I paid and I got what I paid for. I don't think the reviewers that praised these shorts have ever used quality bike shorts. I blame myself not them. I like the light weight, but probably would never use these shorts on a ride of over 25 miles. If you only go for short rides they are probably adequate for you."
3,Men's Bike Shorts,"My first pair of bike shorts. Product is well made and size is true. Pad is a bit stiff, but it distributes the saddle load well. I have since purchased two additional shorts from different manufacturers. In comparison, this pair is average. Nashbar shorts (about the same price point) breathe/wick moisture better, however, the chamois is less padded. Pearl Izumi shorts have good padding and wick moisture well, however, cost more than double. I live in Hawaii, ave temp high 80's, so moisture control is important."
2,"Thin pad, not high quality biking pants",The pad in these pants is very thin and overall the material quality does not appear very high. I would recommend going with a higher quality pair (such as the Pearl Izumi Quest) if you plan on riding longer than 20 miles at a time.
5,Very satisfied,"These are very nice bike shorts, and it's great to see that items of excellent quality can be made in USA and sold at a reasonable price.Been wearing them for daily rides (10 to 35 mi/day) most of summer. No complaints."
4,Great shorts for the money!,"For the most part these are some of the nicest shorts you can ride in. For the price you're not going to find better shorts. I've found them to be really great for about the first hour, after that they start getting a little flat, but I usually only ride for about an hour so it works out, as far as durability they seem to be holding up pretty well. I've ridden maybe 15 hours in them and they have been washed a dozen times and still look to be in good shape."
5,As good as bike shorts get!!!,"Have a pair that I have ridden over 1000 miles with, washed them constantly, have done 60 miles in one day and have not had one issue, they are comfortable and feel good, quality is superb for cost. Buy them."
5,Nice bike shorts,"We have been wearing these shorts for about 2 seasons with good results. I ride about 6,000 miles per year and my wife 2,000. This recent purchase is my third pair. The pad is just right. It doesn't wrinkle or bunch up. A nice touch is the blue leg grippers on the men's version (pink on the ladies). Easy to sort after the laundry."
4,Not your usual awesomesauce,"These are my first pair of proper biking shorts, and I'm fairly pleased. I would caution that the riding bones (the bottom of your pelvis) aren't protected with padding - perhaps that's because I'm a big-boned kind of guy :-p Overall, they're very sleek and comfy. I definitely appreciate the padded crotch, despite it not covering all of the rear...."
5,So Far So Good,I recently started riding and this was my first pair of cycling shorts. About two months in riding 2-3 times a week and no sign of wear. I like them so much I just purchased my second pair.
2,Padding is thin,"Just received the shorts tonight and went out for a quick one hour ride. The padding is thinner than anticipated and doesn't come up the back side very high - about mid-butt is all. It wasn't comfortable walking around in them as I always felt like they were out of place. On the bike, they felt much better. After the ride, I felt the raw, sore inner thighs I endured before I broke down and bought biking shorts (maybe not quite as bad). I'm comparing these shorts to a $45 pair I purchased at a national chain sporting goods store. Given the choice again, I would have spent the extra $10 and got something higher quality."
5,Great bike shorts.,"I'm pleasantly surprised, and I'm going to buy a second pair. Comfort and function are top notch. We'll see how they do after washing, but so far superb value at this price point. Zero chafing or irritation. (I usually do 10-12 miles/day, Trek hybid.)"
4,A Great Set of Shorts for the Price,"These bike shorts have proved to be comparable to other riding shorts and they typically cost about one-half of their retail value, so I highly recommend them. They're not the best are are certainly adequate and a great value. They seem well made and are comfortable to ride."

5,Brand new and ready to use,This came in the mail very quickly. It was brand new and sounds great. This was the only place I could find it.
5,Far better quality than older reviews,"I just purchased the 2005 widescreen DVD and was totally impressed with the quality. Other reviewers suggested it was not good. I have the original video on laser disc (4X3) and transferred it to DVD a number of years ago. Because it was 4X3 is why I wanted the newer 16X9 version. It blows my laser disc version away. It's not blue-ray, but the event it is now 25 years old and neither you nor any of you friends will find this anything but equal or better than the best quality you would expect today for a standard current DVD. The quality is excellent.The man is a genius and this shows his extraordinary talent in spades. I've spent more than 20 times the cost of this video to see him in person. While his concerts have been great and I will see him live again, I will watch this DVD again and again."
5,Mr Jefferson,"Wonderful dvd. Sting is a goofball in his interviews, but forget about it, his performances both in rehearsal and concert are astounding.And Omar, did I mention Omar? His drumming is fabulous all the way through. Two of the best all time solo performances perhaps ever captured on dvd are herein:1) Omar's drum solo on 'I burn for you'.2) Branford's sax (clarinet??) solo on 'Children's crusade.'I've watched this probably 20 times at least and still love it.Stings rendition of 'message in a bottle' closes the dvd out and tugs at heart every time..."
4,"if you like sting, this is for you","a solid addition to the rockumentary genre. this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars.looking back it is obvious that sting was meant to have a solo career (and arguably he was solo with the police). at the time of this movie, it was not so obvious and the suspense around how he will fare is interesting. the music is super, the behind the scenes look is interesting and his band of jazz luminaries adds richness."
1,not what it appears,"What is Prairie Style? You'll never find out from this book. It is a mish-mash of things that are rather geometric. It uses some terrible new designs that detract from the otherwise wonderfully executed designs by the original designers. There is so much Stickley presented here it should have a different title. Some of the best of the Prairie School is not included. This book had a chance with the great cover but after flipping through it, looking at the photographs, it went right down hill. Taking time to read the text took it right to the bottom. Someone should try this subject again, with an understanding of the subject."
1,Little of worth here,"I moved next door to the Babson house in Oak Park in 1990 and can guarantee that the photo in the book is from the street and not the back yard as the author suggests. A couple of years later I moved just around the corner from the Charles Barr home. This is in River Forest, not Riverside. I could overlook this dubious research if there were more that was worth reading or looking at, but the writing is uninspired rehash and the photos are not great. There are many much better done books available on the subject."
3,LIKE A STORY BOOK,THIS BOOK HAS STORIES TO TELL I WAS THINKING IT WAS GOING TO HAVE ACTUALL TECHNIQUES...BUT I GUESS THEY WILL NEVER TELL.
3,Ice Spiders,"Being a long time fan of giant bug movies this doesn't disappoint. Although not as large as the old Black & White radiated versions of the Fifties and Sixties, there still about the size of large dogs and the special effects are decent. The cast are typical B type with a few exceptions. The SciFi channel produces all types from extreme hokey schlock to reasonably decent effects and entertaining. This is closer to the latter. I recommend at least a rental if you don't catch it on the SciFi channel. If you want to catch a good old classic version of giant bugs, seeThem! (Snap Case)CA Luster"
3,Crazy Spider Movie,"If you do not have anything to do and you like spider movies,even if they are bad,this one is for you.The acting is lousy and nothing really positive except watching colorful spiders attack people."
2,Special effects are like those of a TV show which are neither bad nor good. It's worth watching once.,The special effects are like that of a TV show which are neither bad nor good. The spiders do not look scary. There are quite a few of bloody scenes where people are eaten by the spiders. There are some scary movements. The acting are not convincing. It's still worth watching once for curiosity.
3,It has the right ingredients....,"This movie rides above bad movies, but barely. We have great spider effects, and lots of blood, we have the outdoors, some good skiing scenes.The script was decent. I rated this one above Roger Cormans movies. Thetrouble is the casting...Must be a crappy casting company to come up withsome crappy actors that eventually brings the movie down. Especially near the end of the movie. Dont get me wrong..there was some good acting though. Good acting would make problems more transparent.So, yes its really worth a viewing, especially for the spiders and skiing."
2,A decent giant bug movie,"I actually wasted money renting this instead of watching it on the SciFi channel on Saturday night which, around my house, has become Bad SciFi Movie Night. The spiders are obviously CGI and occasionally appear to be from a different movie. Most of the actors are unknowns and this movie won't be aiding them in their efforts to get noticed by Spielberg. The recycled plot is that scientists have been studying spider silk (stronger than steel and flexible) and, for some reason, one scientist genetically engineered the spiders, which grew larger and larger and then escaped.I like scifi when it's big and dumb (hey, I watched MST3K for nearly 10 years) but, honesly, I've seen better giant spider movies."
2,Not what you think,"If you liked Bring Me the Workhorse, you may have been like me and got really exited about this remix album. The album is nothing like Shara Worden's debut. It just takes samples of her amazing voice from BMTW and works them into dance music. This disc is very disappointing. Some of the remixes really miss the point of the original song. If you are really into house or subterranean, you may find this album great, but one of the best parts of the first go through was that Shara wrote all of the music herself. Buy at your own risk."
2,Not a good mix,"Unlike ""Bring Me the Workhorse,"" a wonderful album, ""Tear it Down"" really does not hold up to more than 1 listen, if that. Basically, this is a re-working of the songs from ""Bring me the Workhorse"" into techno/electro music by various artists. Other than maybe the first 2 tracks, I don't think that the mix of MBD's music with the techno sound is successful. It comes across as an esoteric mutilation of ""Bring me the Workhorse."" If you're a huge techno fan, you might enjoy this. But for those of us who are not, but nonetheless fans of My Brightest Diamond, we can only hope that their next album will showcase their talents more effectively."
5,An oldie but goodie,"This movie is one of my favorite MSB videos. It is a true oldie but goodie video. It teaches kids about how sound is made and what it can do in the world today. During the movie, the class has to performe infront of parents, but Carlos, who has to make his own instrument, can't seem to find the right sound. With the help of Mrs. Frizzel and some other friends, Carlos saves the day with his musical instrument."
2,"Smells good, watery consistency","The shampoo smelled great, but it was so watery I had trouble keeping it from running between my fingers. Once I got it on my hair it really doesn't clean well, I now have to wash my hair in sections, with a handful of twenty dollar shampoo per area. It'll be a while before I live this purchase down with my husband. :)"
4,Shampoo's consistency has been inconsistent,"I really like this shampoo. I feel like it leaves my hair light and shiny. The only thing that perplexes me is that the shampoo was thick and not bubbly the first time I bought it on Amazon. The second time I bought it on Amazon it was really thin and more bubbly. It seems like there might be some quality control issues, or the shampoo is sitting too long before sale. I still plan to use this shampoo b/c I think it is high quality. I'm just a bit intrigued by how thick and bubbly it will be the next time I get it. The only other downside of this shampoo is that I do find that it takes two washes to get my hair clean. Because of this, it runs out more quickly. My hair falls just below my shoulder and tends to get oily half-way through the day after washing."
2,WAY OVERPRICED!!!,"Okay, first, I don't actually own this. However, I was very interested in this line of products because I suppose I was swept away by the name, glamor, and glitz. I was also a chemistry major in college and before determing if I was going to spend my hard earned money on a consumable and upon seeing the list and order of ingredients, I promptly decided not to buy this.The first ingredient is water, followed by sodium laurel sulfate (a lathering ingredient), and some other very common shampoo and conditioner ingredients that are exactly the same as the $1.00 bottle (and double the volume in the bottle) of Suave shampoo and conditioner. Which is really suave? You be the judge. Either way, it's your icky hair gunk and money that literally go down the drain."
1,"FINAL DESTINATION ,THE USED BIN","Final Destination is a super natural thriller about well death,so how could it be so bad,let me count the ways. First off the movie starts out with a plane like we have never seen one of those turn on the news. Next the movie drags slowly with kids that decided to get off the plane get questioned which drags on too long. Finally some dies by falling in the tub from water seeping under a toilet(this scene could have been so good,but instead its got a supernatural feel to it)and next more deaths continue kinda of boring a guy on a bus gets hit,like we have never seen that either. Lastly at least the movie could have some sex appeal to make up for the slowness but the movie fails again Ali Larter looks like a poodle,I don't understand in Varsity Blues she looks pretty darn good but in this I didn't even recognize her. HOPEFULLY FINAL DESTINATION 2 WILL MAKE UP FOR MY LOST TIME WITH THE FIRST ONE"
4,Holds you from start to finish,"I admit the opening scene in Scream scared the [heck] out of me the firsttime I saw it but opening scene for this movie scared me so much thatmy legs were still shaking 15 minutes after it happend. Devon Sawyerstars as Alex who is surpose to take a school trip to Paris but beforethe plane takes off he has a haunting vision of it blowing up andgets kicked off the plane for yelling that the plane is gonna blowup ,6 others get kicked off as well. Keer Smith plays the marcho bullythat's [mad] at Alex because he caused him a trip to Paris untilall of a sudden the plane does blow up. Death gets [mad] when peoplecheat death so now the seven survivors are being stalked by deathin the order they would of died on the plane. The result is a nailbiting edge of your seat thrill ride that never lets up until theclosing credits."
4,You Can't Cheat Death Or Can You?,"What do you do when you see the future, a vision that shows you who will died and how. Alex has premonition that a flight his on, going to Paris is going to crash. Nobody believes but in the confusion seven people get off the plane. 10 minutes later the plane blows up just like Alex says, the seven survives are in shock but its not over yet, its seems that death has a path set for everyone and when its messed with. Theirs no option but to finish what has to be done, to come back around to take care of loose ends.Teen horror with a good storyline and a well put together cast of young fresh faces,if your in for a fun ride with scares and chills this is all for you."
5,Thrilling! Fantastic! One of a kind!,"I really enjoyed this movie so much, it was amazing, very well made. It kept me at the edge of my seat while I watched it at the movie theatre, everyone I know has seen it, and I can't wait to own it, I love it, a must see for everyone and everyone who likes horror suspense, please go rent it or buy it you will not be dissapointed."
5,Great horror movie,I love the Original 'Final Destination' movie. It is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. I can watch it over and over again.
4,brown trousers time,"OK, SO IT'S NOT REALLY BELIEVABLE, BUT IT IS QUITE SCARY WITH PLENTY OF GORE. BY TAPPING INTO OUR WORST FEARS(DEATH AND WHEN IS IT MY TIME) THE FILM PROVIDES THE SCARES AND JUMPS THAT RECENT HORROR FILMS(SCREAM 3 I'M TALKING TO YOU) LACKED. AS WITH MANY HORROR MOVIES THE RELATIVELY UNKNOWN CAST AT TIMES CHEW THEIR WAY THROUGH THE PROCEDINGS, BUT RIGHT FROM THE OFF SET WITH THE VERY NASTY PLANE CRASH, FINAL DESTINATION WILL LOCK YOU IN AND KEEP YOU ROOTED TO YOUR SEAT, WITH JUMPS A PLENTY AND MORE THAN IT'S FAIR SHARE OF GRISLY DEATHS. SIT DOWN, SWITCH OFF YOUR BRAIN AND ENJOY THE FAST PACED ACTION."
3,Entertaining Teen Gore Fest!,"Written by 'X-Files' veteran James Wong, he does manage to add some supernatural elements and an undercurrent of creepyness to the film. While it lacks smart dialogue and originality, it does offer some genuine scares, the jump-out-of-your-seat kind. Plausible plot and premise. This one starts out very well, the first 20 minutes are a great way to start this film, but then takes the wrong direction and barely scores as a teen thriller. Entertaining and enjoyable if you don't pay much attention. The ending is also good, depending on which way you look at it. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!"
2,"JAMES WONG, OPUS 1","** 2000. Written and directed by James Wong. Six students and a teacher manage to escape a plane crash thanks to a premonition of Alex Browning, one of them. A few weeks later, Death starts to kill the survivors one by one. FINAL DESTINATION is basically a stupid movie about a good idea. There isn't here only one smart scene or idea, it seems that the director wanted to please the teen audience by delivering another pimply shocker and that's all. In these perspective, a film like Peter Jackson'sThe Frighteners (Director's Cut)which handles some of the themes of FINAL DESTINATION is a masterpiece! This one is unfortunately already forgotten."
3,Good Horror Movie: Lousy Language,"What really made me rate this movie lower was the continual use of the F word. That is not at all necessary in making the movie work. It was a good movie, though. The type that keeps you on your feet. It is nice to see movies that don't rely on anything sexual in their plot."
5,Why the heck are you still online? go see this movie!,"This movie is funny and frightfully scary at the same time. It was really well done and definetly cahnges your point of view and can chill you to the bone or make you laugh out loud! I definetly recomend this movie if your looking for a fun, scary movie to make you scream and laugh. Go see this movie. NOW!"
4,Film Falls Apart After Great Opening But Still Worthwhile,"The film basically falls apart after a terrific opening sequence. Everything leading up to the plane crash and its aftermath was amazingly well done - a mix of humor, Hitchcockian suspense and foreboding. The director even strived for poignancy and pathos - after the crash, he even included clips of the presumed search and rescue operation and showed how a real plane crash would affect survivors, from the funeral to the high school eulogies. I was impressed by how detailed this attention was to the loss of human life in what presumably is a typical teenage horror film. From this high point, however, the film degenerated and became a typical slasher film, absurd and rather silly. By the end of the film I had lost interest and it became nonsensical. What a shame - if only the end had lived up to the beginning of the film."
3,Disappointing feature from the talented Morgan and Wong,"When a high school student's premonition of death causes several of his classmates and a teacher to narrowly avoid being killed on an exploding airplane, they gradually come to understand the rules that Death follows and attempt to avoid their own fates. Having enjoyed Glen Morgan's and James Wong's television work on ""X-Files,"" ""Millennium,"" and ""Space: Above and Beyond,"" my expectations were high for this film. Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver consistently enough. Although the atmosphere was appropriately creepy, I found the premise to be quite silly and this is a flaw that is hard to bounce back from."
3,See it on DVD. Watch the alternate ending.,"I was actually surprised, this is a 4 star story line which is only brought down to an average of 3 because of the weak cast. Worth watching though, if you don't mind recasting the movie in your head after, it may be one of the best plots for a movie in a long time. The producers had it right keeping the ending as it plays in the movie. The additional material shows an alternate ending well worth watching, along with test screening footage. You'll realize that the movie was worth the price because of this. I have it in my collection for the great special effects in the beginning. This movie is predictable in an unpredictable way. There are a couple of scenes where you may grab your lover. If you want to induce fear of flying in a friend, show it before their next trip (use slow motion to scare the hell out of them).Great sound and visual quality. DVD features make it worth owning even if your not into sci-fi."
5,I thought it was funny and scary!,"This was definately the scariest movie I have EVER seen, it totally freaked me out! But there was a few parts that I just HAD to laugh! Maybe it was to keep myself from screaming, but there was one part where a guy got his head chopped off and he just stood there for a few seconds before he fell. I thought it was so funny! Everybody thinks I'm stupid for thinking it was funny, but I couldn't help myself! Some people say the movie ""copies"" the Twilight Zone, but I have never seen that, so it didn't affect me. And some people say the acting is not very good, but I don't know where they got that from; I thought they did a great job. I was holding on to my seat the WHOLE time! You should this movie if you liked the Sixth Sense(that was a great movie, too):)"
5,A horror film that finally apeales to me.,This film is excellent in it's dvd edition becuase it's all planed out well with crystal clear picture and sound. The animated menue's are well timed. And special features are enough to satisfire anyone and the director's comemtry is excellent as I always enjoy how they decided on the film style etc. There is one point about this dvd that I think they should have change on the uk release and that is the rating of the film. I think that a 15 rating for this film was to low and should of been an 18 certificate instead. I think US rating by the mpa of america was right on with there rated R certificate. which the R certificate is the equivelent to an 18 in the UK. I would advise that if you are sqimish like me then you should know that there are quite a few scene that are bloodly and sometimes gory. but apart from that the film is definately worth a buy.
2,"Interesting idea, bad execution","I found the story idea for this film very interesting, and the writer and director could have done so much more with it. However, as it stands, the movie is quite boring. There are so many elements to this movie that could have been fleshed out more. What comes to mind, particularly, is the surrealistic encounter with the man at the funeral home. They could have brought his character in again at a later time for some more interest."
5,great movie,awesome effects really makes u think but sorta scares u at the same time. i was hoping for a sequal with the surviors but the sequel wont have anyone from the first one. but great movie!
3,"Intereting premise, but dissapointing execution.","I'm a lover of horror films, and I really wanted to like this one. The premise of this film seemed interesting to me, but its execution is severely lacking. It never manages to convey a sense of urgency, or even the inevitability of the deaths closing in on the characters. Part of the cause for this is that the mysterious fates that are stalking the characters do so in a rediculous fashion... and then they bother to hide the ""accidents"" as suicides."
5,one of the best horror flicks ever!!!!!!!!,"FINAL DESTINATION is one of my favourite films because it was completely original... death following you not a typical slasher.... this is the first movie i was shocked and appauld by...in the middle of the movie, i had to walk out of the theater and one point... this movie changed the game of all horror flicks....the sequel is a great one too... it is as shocking as the first but this one takes the cake....all i can say i will never look at airplanes the same ever....5 stars out of 5"
2,BOR-,"-ING. OK if you have nothing else to watch. Starts out fairly interestingly, ends up sludge. Tounge in cheek or not, it's just not a good film. Nothing you haven't seen before, and done better. Part 2 is a little slicker."
5,Super Super Good Movie,"It's a must see! One of my favorites that I have seen. If you are not a fan of horror/suspense..this obviously isn't for you (as the first critic must not have been). I wish they had done the ending just a LITTLE differently though! I could have made it (the ending) better...but it was still very good. This is a movie I always recommend to people when we talk ""good movies"". There are scenes (one in particular) that will shock the hell out of you! And a word of advise....if you don't know much about the movie...to make it really interesting..don't read anything about it before you watch it..cause I didn't and that is why I think I enjoyed it so much (because I had no clue what the movie was going to be about) some friends brought it over to watch..so I wasn't the one that rented/picked it out. ENJOY!!"
3,pretty decent for a horror movie.,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed watching Final Destination. There are definitely some flaws in the story--it would have been more believable if ""death"" was natural rather than supernatural as they portray it in the movie. Anyway, the DVD version has an alternate ending and some deleted scenes. Worth buying? Maybe not."
4,A Must See Thriller,"I didn't quite know what to expect when I first saw this film, but was intrigued by it. High School Senior Alex is traveling to Paris with his French Class. A nightmare of the plane exploding seems all but too real for the young man, and emotion takes the best of him. After being evicted from the plane, he and six others watch in horror as the plane really does explode. For many the memorial service would be the end of the story, but the movie takes an unusual twist, when the survivors begin dying. His best friend dies after a premonition he has, and slowly, more of the group begin doing the same. The story has many twists and turns, but centers around a belief that you can't escape death, and that it is continually lurking behind you. This film is full of action, and suspense, making it one of my top picks."
5,great show,"cool movie, kept me on the edge of my seat. the end really gets you if you don't watch out."
2,This Movie Is Really Wierd,"I guess you could describe this movie as being...well...different, but different isn't really always that great. The movie centers around a group of high school students going on their senior class trip to Paris. Right before the plane takes off, he has a vision of it exploding. He an others escape off the plane before it takes off, and predicitbly, explodes. The surviving members of the flight(3 boys, 3 girls) are strangely knocked off one by one, through odd strings of events(I.E. strangulation, hitting by bus, impalment, explosion, decapitation, and other sorts of justt..well just yewwwwyyy sorts of deaths. The movie lacks in script, but the oh so inventive ways of executing people, is just absolutly worth watching. If you haven't seen it, and are at the video store, wondering if you should rent it...wait till it comes on Network!"
3,"Good movie, some parts not developed","This was a pretty good movie, but definetely not the best. The action scenes and story line was excellent but near the end of the movie some of the same thing started happening again. Also I think it was kind of rushed towards the end of the movie, the makers didn't spend enough time developing certain characters and charater relationships and that kind of left me hanging in a way. However it was still pretty good, eventhough I probally will not get it on DVD."
3,HI...I AM TELEPATHIC,"The idea of the movie was good...unfortunately...it was packaged to be a teeny bopper horror scare. However pop, it does have some mind blowing occurances that are up there with Brad Pitt's bus incident in Meet Joe Black. Okay...it's not that bad of a movie after all....I'd watch it again."
4,Death is Coming !,"I loved this movie to DEATH. It was a wonderfully thought ofidea for a film. The title was catchy and the storyline was great. Andwhat was even better was the gorey Murder, Murder scences. I only gave this film four stars because I'm greety I wanted more of those Death defying Murder scences. The actors did a good job and the airplane plot was whoaa! CHECK THIS FILM OUT big time, it definitely made my top five for the new year so far. WATCH OUT FOR DEATH ... because HE'S Coming."
3,Not horrible....not great,"I will sum this up in a sentence or two. The plot was good....I loved the idea of what they wanted to do. But they didn't do a good job of it. I can't see how it was ""scary"" though...it's really not that type of movie. More suspense than scary. It is worth watching to kill (no pun intended) an evening, but it won't leave anyone with much other than ""oh...I've seen worse as well as better."""
4,Enjoyable film,"This is a rather creative and fun film which showed scariness without relying on monsters, werewolves, or serial killers. Rather, it focuses on the scariest thing of them all - Death. How do you escape Death once he has his sights on you? How do you escape a force which no walls, key, or lock can bar away? Well... you could try to outsmart him, and that is exactly what this group of young people try to do when one of them has a premonition which saves his friends from an accident which they were destined to die (hence the title of this movie, which serves as a non-dirty double etendre)Overall a creative and imaginative horror movie which eventually spawned a whole series of sequels, but you simply cannot go wrong with the original Final Destination. A must-see!!!"
1,Not Good at All,"The movie starts out well enough, but as it goes along it gets more contrived. The plot is ok, but the acting and script were terrible. Stifler from American Pie was completely miscast. If you enjoy Teen Horror films, this wont disappoint, but if you want something as well written as Scream, which wasnt that well written anyway, you are looking at the wrong move. The cheesy lines were awful, but it kept me laughing because of it. Rent if you want to see it."
2,I can't understand all the hype,"This movie starts out good, but than goes down hill from there. I was expecting more after seeing the crash. It had my attention until after the teens started getting killed. The first one to go in the bathroom was interesting. But the others deaths were pretty lame. A rehash of what we have seen already. This movie didn't make me jump once. I was waiting to be scared. The ending was terrible. They should have left it like it was before showing them in France. An ending can ruin a movie. Final Destination was a good idea gone wrong."
1,The Feces Of The Species,"My sister dragged me to see this awful movie when it first came out, telling me how good it would be and how it was going to be as scary, if not scarier than ""Scream"". Yeah right. Maybe if you're a 12-year old Slaughter fan who's never seen anything more adult than ""Lilo And Stitch"" it would be scary. The long and short of it is a stupid, spoiled rich (I think he was rich...shows how much I paid attention to this stinker) brat who goes to Paris with his equally useless, boring and bratty friends and sees their deaths or something like that. I wouldn't know anything else about it because it was such a turkey that Butterball could cut it up and sell it as lunch meat and that's probably the reason both my sister and I fell asleep partway through it. I give this floating log of a movie 1 star only because it can't go any lower! I want my [$$]back!! Avoid this at all costs!"
1,"do not buy this movie, ever!","This movie is by far and away the most horrific piece of garbage I have ever had the misfortune of being subjected to. I was forced to watch this turd on a bus trip where I was unable to avoid watching it. If an entire busload of complete strangers unanimously agree that this was a terrible movie, I can not possibly see how this movie ever made a buck. It has been said that this movie was an attempt at humor. If people actually find this humorous, then god help us all. Friends don't let friends see this movie."
1,Worst Horror Movie I Have Ever Seen,"A work of comedic genious? Perhaps, but as a horror, it could be no worse, the plot is [weak]. Basically this flick deals with the idea that if death is on your path you're toast, no matter what you do to try and escape it, real scarry huh? no, its not. Luckily for the cast, one strong willed gent has figured out this plan of death's. he takes matters into his own, powerful, ingenious hands. even after this ""hunk"" realizes out he can't stop it, he goes ahead and tries anyhow, very very very courageous of young vern. if you ask me, this guy is a little light in his loafers. final destination couldn't hold the attention of an invalid, sat in a chair, in a locked room with no way to shut off the tv, and nothing else in the room. i hated this movie with a passion. i hate the fact that somebody could possibly like it. and i believe my review reflects that."
1,Sorry but Far from a classic ...,"I'm sorry to say that I lost my time watching this movie ... This is one of the worst movie I saw in 2000 ... This is for the people that really enjoy movies like Scream or other poor scary movie ... Actors are great, but the movie itself is far from a classic ... Great FX but that's about it ... Hope we will have the chance to see a better movie before the end of the year ..."
1,It insults the intelligence of even a 10 year old!,"WARNING!! POSSIBLE SPOILER OF GARBAGE: This movie is absolute garbage! It stank! It reeked!! It had as much suspense and thrill impact as a peanut butter sandwich. And, OHHHHHHHH, I was SOOOOOOOO scared by the whisps of wind that foretold of an upcoming death. This movie is mindless drivel. It insults even a 10 year old viewer. Young children have more intelligence and discrimination than is demanded of them when watching this clap-trap and offal. This movie can't really be rated. It OWES the viewers a couple of stars!!"
5,terrifying!,"I have never been so on the edge of my seat as much as i was while watching this movie....when it was finished, I felt pain in my hands and looking down I realized all of my fingernails were gone and I am not joking. This was the scariest film I have ever seen. I found myself yelling at the screen and screaming in terror, and I being a horror freak who has seen much worse. THe subject of death however is one that scares me and this movie was designed to scare....I seriously do not understand how people could not enjoy this movie...it was great and one I totally recommend....this DVD is a keeper!"
5,Best Thriller since the Sixth Sense,"I absolutely loved this movie! Very well done. I left the theatre still thinking...what if it is true. I mean, how many times have you crossed the street and almost gotten hit? Or tripped and been inches from hitting your head on the corner of a table, breathing a sigh of relief? I know this has happened to me quite a few times in my life. The best horror flicks are those that have a plot that revolves around what humans fear, but are too afraid to talk about. Death is something that people fear the most. Final destination hits all of the tender spots when it comes to death, holds you there and then drops you. This is definately a must have movie to own, it will be a classic. If you enjoyed The Faculty(One of my favorite horror flicks of the 90's) and Sixth Sense(My 2nd favorite horror flick of the 90's) you'll really like Final destination. Happy movie watching! Heth"
3,"FINAL DESTINATION-SHADES OF ""DAMIEN""","I ENJOYD FINAL DETINATION AND THOUGHT IT WAS WAY BETTER THAN OVERATED CRAP LIKE SCREAM AND I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER BUT AS I WATCHED THIS FILM I COULDNT'T HELP BEING REMINDED OF THE OMEN AND DAMIEN OMEN II THESE TWO CLASSIC FILMS WERE THE FIRST TO HAVE ACCIDENTAL CREATIVE DEATH SCENES AND DID THEMWITHOUT THE HELP OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS.

2,clever but too much,"well i have the say i missed this on when it first came our but i saw FD2 and i liked it but seeing this one, it kinda turned me off from the start, why must u ask? because the fact that losing two family memebers in the WTC haunts me till and the graphic scenes here in the movie gave me a few nightmares to what it was like to see my relatives to blow up which is very disturbing. i know you may not agree on what i have to say but i think in some sense the filmmakers outta ease up on it but other than the 1st scenes it was alright specially when the one kid got smoked by a bus...seen better flicks"
2,"""Destination"" is a Mess","When I first saw this film I was looking forward to what I thought would be an interesting new thriller. Although it turned out to be extremnly violent and with an unbelievable story line. Ihis movie starts out wonderfully with the scen at the airport and the dream and then the plane crash. But after the that its basically a gore fest with blood every 5 minutes. After a few deaths (which I might ad are extremly random and could rarely occur) Devon Sawa thinks that there is a pattern to which these deaths are occuring, and basically the whole movie is just watching people die then watching people try to escape the death. Although the movie did try, and the look of the movie is great the overall movie is a mess. And before watching notice the R Rating this movie drops the F- Bomb thousands of times and many times its pointless."
5,Nerve shaking,"Very freaky movie. It gives you that false sense of security like In the part when the car locks him in on the train tracks, but he gets out. You didn't think that a minute later, the train would run over a piece of metal and chop the guys' head off who was stuck in his car on the tracks. Original plot. Very good movie, but it is pretty fake. If it was remade today it would have been a lot better. Hard to do anything after this movie because you'll be scared that something will kill you that you wouldn't expect."
1,"forgettable, mainstream 'horror'","yawn. After seeing movies like 'Rec', or even respectably good horrors like 'Exorcist III' , movies like 'Final Destination' feels so boring, so forgettable, so dull, you wonder why you are wasting your time. I hate half-assed movies like this one. For reasons I don't understand, they are hyped, as well as movies like 'Screams'. On IMBD this film has a rating of 6.7. A good movie like 'Exorcist III' is rated at 6, yet the latter blows 'Final Destination' out of the water. I'll go back to sleep."
1,Final Destination Cheats Only The Viewers,"Final Destination goes nowhere but down. The acting is horrible, except for Ali Larter, although that doesn't save this movie from catastrophe. Like most teen-slasher movies, the plot is VERY predictable, although half the deaths in this movie are literally impossible.(Computer screens don't explode! Busses don't go fast enough while turning a corner, to kill someone! Neon signs can't turn sideways! The scene with the eletrical wire defied every law of Physics. You catch my drift...) Honestly, this movie is not worth seeing, and if you want to see a good scary movie, the Exorcist, Silence of the Lambs, and even the Blair Witch Project are more satisfying than this! Steer clear, watching this movie is worse than being subject to any of the deaths in this movie, 100 times."
1,come on,"This movie was just disgusting, not scary. The plot was weak and predictable, and most of the cast was unintelligent. The acting wasn't too bad, but it certainly wasn't top-notch. I hate how most of these teen slasher movies are all basically the same argo most if not all cast members die at a certain point and the main character is sitting down and drinking champange at the end and of course he doesn't die because then there wouldn't be a movie. Well, if you enjoy watching people die/and or you like the sight of blood and lots of it, then this movie is for you."
1,Waste of time/money/resources/etc.,"This movie was....what's the word? AWFUL. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to waste their valuable time. The overall concept is quite ingenius, but it was just so predictable and ridiculous. I knew everything that was going to happen. I could have written this movie if someone gave me the idea. I would rather have my nose hairs ripped out one by one rather than think of this movie again."
2,Very Cool Premise which turns into a not so good movie!,"... I have to say that I was expecting so much more from this film. The idea of death catching up to those who have avoided it makes a really cool premise for a movie, but in the end it just doesn't live up to my expectations. The acting is rather weak and the ending is pretty bad as well. If you don't take the movie too serious you probably will enjoy much more. I will admit the death seens were wickedly cool, but that still doesn't make up for a movie with so much potential that just fails to deliver."
1,TOTAL ABOMINATION,"Hold on to those ceredit cards. To put it bluntly, this movie bites. Over an hour and a half of typical teeny-bopper nonsense. Everyone associated with this ""project from hell"" should be tarred and feathered. First off the script is poorly written. Then the direction of the script is poorly executed. Oh, let's not forget the casting. The only thing this movie was missing was Freddie Prinze JR, Sarah Gellar, and the Backside Boys. My God what has the movie making industry come to. Shame on New Line who usually put out good filmaking."
1,A First For Everything....,"I have never walked out of a movie in my entire life. Even if a flick is bad, I feel that since I just dropped ten or more dollars, I might as well try to make it through. But this movie?!?!?! Final Destination is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and actually walked out leaving this B.S. movie to the rest of my friends.The plot line? Totally predictable...The Acting? Worse than my little neice's grade school production...The hour of my life watching this? Totlly Lost!!!Ok, I know I sound like I am going overboard here, but I did give this movie one star because my airhead sorority friend actually loved it.... Go Figuere!Anyone out there, tell me why this movie has 4 stars!"
2,Ali Larter is a hottie.,Cool idea - I loved it when the plane blew up. Ali Larter is a total hottie. This was almost as good as the sequel.
4,Devon's best performance yet!,"I saw this movie in theatres and if you're the type that likes thriller fims that actually have a smart plot, then you'll love this. The acting is amazing and Devon Sawa puts out a great performance. I highly recommend it to teenagers and early 20's. Its a great movie!"
4,Fantastic Movie,"This movie is EXTREMELY entertaining and suspenseful. The only reason I'm only giving it 4 instead of 5 is that FD2 is superior in every way...but please NOTE: You must watch #1 to get background information on many charcters and events before seeing #2. So in that light, FD2 being an essential movie automatically makes FD1 an essential movie. Plus, you'll like it, too."
4,great movie,"great movie to laugh and jump at. its a great slumber party movie, not too heavy, but still good. the alternate ending isnt very good tho. :-("
2,"Inventive story, but just not for me",I thought the story behind 'Final Destination' was great. It has some clever twists and turns. But the whole death issue was a bit too much for me. I don't want to think about that now! I can't watch this movie very often. Too depressing!
2,"Uh, what? You want a ""title"" for this review? Maybe, ""Disappointed""?","These shoes run very small to size. Ordered size 8.5 2E and seems more like a 7 - 7.5w... certainly NOT extra wide and not a size 8.5. Haven't returned yet, so not sure how THAT will go. I'm quite leery of trying for an exchange... what if THAT doesn't fit either? Am I going to be charged for returning? twice? Uh,uh... I'm thinking just return and cut my losses. Also, both boxes (outer shipping and inner shoe box) were crushed upon delivery. This had BETTER not cause a problem with a return and refund!"
5,Shoes from a Grocery Store?,"I recently went to a trip to beautiful Alaska and had forgotten my shoes. We went to a Fred Myers store in Anchorage and low and behold they had a shoe department. That is where I found this pair of Eastland Sequoia slip on shoes ON SALE!!!! I loved the look and they felt okay when I tried them on. After a couple of days hiking and breaking them in I have decided they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had in my life. They fit like a glove and I can wear them with socks or hose. They are easy to maintain and always look good. I will buy more Eastland shoes - even if I can't get them at a grocery store! Believe me, you will love these shoes. JB -"
5,The Mercury 13 by Martha Ackmann,"This book depicts the lives of women astronauts during aperiod of American history when the space program had aplurality of men. The period is the 50s and early 60swhen the contest between the USA and the Soviet Union heatedup in space. The book describes the successful launch ofFreedom 7 in 1961 despite some early problems. There aremany pictures of the astronauts depicting achievements duringthe various milestones of the space program. Ultimately,the Committee on Science and Astronauts concluded that theadvantages of having women astronauts merited a formalprogram of research and study. This was a government actionlong sought by women in the pursuit of careers as astronauts.The book includes details of the experiences of Janey Hart-an early astronaut and participant founder of NOW.A report on this book would make a fine student projectfor budding scientists."
2,Mercury 13,"The book does a poor job depicting a key part in women's history. The history itself is not boring or confusing at all. In fact the story of the Mercury 13 women is very interesting and should be taught to everyone. Reading this book is a tiresome and irksome task for even an veteran reader. Martha Ackmann mutilated a historical event. She turned an epic struggle into a unrecognizable, confusing, monster of a book that the average person cannot clearly and decisively comprehend."
2,If you enjoyed this book or are thinking or reading it...,"Read Stephanie Nolen's ""Promised the Moon: The Untold Story of the First Women in the Space Race"" instead.Nolen does an amazing job of contexualizing why these women were selected and why they ultimately remained grounded. If you must choose between Mercury 13 and Promisted the Moon I would go with the second book. Better researched and very well written. Highly recommend."
2,A True Story? Or is it?,"I first read this book a year after it was published, and the contents of it really nauseated me!I recalled the girl's words to her therapist about how she had ""some incest problems with my father."" These words came to Dr. John Woodbury from the patient without the help of hypnosis, although hypnosis was later applied. It appears she had free-standing memories of the ""abuse."" I remember her telling Woodbury that the incest with Dad was ""groovy."" (???!!) Apparently she enjoyed it! What's more, she seemed to have been a consenting partner as if she were her own biological father's ""other woman.""I wonder why the authors wrote the book. Was it to reveal a hidden part of our society? I hope not! The result has been a sexual ""witch hunt"" of great proportions!Barbara Rainey, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA"
3,Mr. cleats,"While this soundtrack off-ramp for the popular Scottish post-rockers can initially sound subdued, repetitious, and lacking the band's trademark soft/loud dynamics, it is in fact one of their more layered and disciplined recordings to date, producing a recording of subtle ambiance, if one that doesn't have all the momentum to finish gracefully."
3,Ineresting and practical but not exhausive.,"I found thsi book to be very intersting, especially at first as it was the first book that I read concerning the Runes. As time has passed and my experience and knowledge has incresed, I question some of the interpretations and practices that Mr Cooper gives in his book. Let me give a little example. For the rune Jera he uses a different shape, one that I have not yet found anywhere else. Apart from some differences, like the given example, I find that the book ""Using the Runes"" by D. Jason Cooper to be valuble and I do not regrett that I bought and read it.sincerly yoursPer Lundberg"
5,Great kettle!,"I was relieved to finally find an attractive tea kettle for my gas stove at a reasonable price. Although the handle and whistle components are plastic, the tea pot performs well, heating the water quickly and insulating the hot water, keeping warm for about 20 minutes afterwards.The sound of the whistle is pleasant, much like a harmonica. If left boiling it can crescendo to a medium-pitch train whistle. Just enough to get me running across the house to tend to the hot stove!Without water it is very light but durable, machine washable, and once again- safe for the gas stove. Alleluia!"
5,Fantastic kettle,"I love this kettle. I looked long and hard for one that would be just right and I'm glad I purchased this one. The melodic harmonica sound is very refreshing, especially in comparison to the high pitched whistle of other kettles. It's also pretty sturdy & I'm predicting it will last me a very long time. Highly recommended!"
1,Suckered in with brand name,"I was the person they were thinking of when they slapped together these dollar store quality(or below, some of those are good!)videos and used a name brand like Bazooka, and great packaging to sell garbage.Being a recent convert to the golden age of cartoons, i have been slowly building my dvd library with quality titles, or what i think to be at time of ordering.What i can recommend are the Image Entertainment line of classic animation, beautiful stuff, this dvd is soft focus, watered down colors, disgusting. To end on a positive note, i will say the packaging was done extremely well, with a color dvd to match the red packaging, a pack of cards with a stick of gum, so in that respect someone took some time and care into the dvd process, just not in content."
5,Height of her powers,"This, for me, still stands as Jayne Anne Phillips finest and most accomplished achievement. Ravishing use of language which never loses sight of the essential humanity of her characters. Not to play favorites, but the stories here that speak most eloquently to me are the two chapters that were excised from her novel MACHINE DREAMS and reworked -- BLUE MOON and BESS. Exquisite."
3,Very Small Screen,"8/12/2008I knew they said it would be 1.5"" screen but I guess I didn't really pay attention to how small that would really look. I bought this game for my 4-1/2 year old since she is always wanting to play with her big sister's (14 y.o.) game.All in all, it's cool for a beginner because it teaches them how to play different types of video games.It's kind of fun for me too.Update12/15/2008This is an update to my previous (appears to be the only) review.This game broke in less than 30 days.DO'T BUY IT. I can't give it 0 stars but that's what it should get."
3,Interesting Book,"The book was good, but not as good as I expected. I felt there was more ""whinning"" in it than necessary."
4,This is really not bad.,"Don't expect something like PAIN or Hypocrisy. This is good, old-fashioned black metal. Fast and raw (not the Dimmu Borgir style, either). If you're into the brutal old school blast-beat black metal, than Abyss is the right stuff for you."
1,Naturewood teakettle,"Although it looks very nice, this item is a failure.I found it to rust inside after about a month.Once rusted, no matter how you clean it, it will rerust.I have quite a few items from the ""Naturewood"" collection as it is our pattern and this item is one of the rare bad items."
3,A Bridge to Bad Parenting,"I saw this film during a course for American Sign Language and procured a copy to study the signing. The actress playing the lead is quite skilled and I enjoyed her portrayal very much. The story was rather generic - but was fairly good. I felt that the film was well done (if rather an unpleasent tale) for most of the movie - but the ending was too quick, too simple. If you seek a good movie to study sign language this is an excellent choice. If you like movies with more finess regarding the topic of deafness I suggest you take a look at 'Beyond Silence'."
3,Astaire's most self-revealing performance?,"This under-rated film in the Astaire canon deserves another look. Not for its mediocre merits as a musical comedy or its sparkle-less gaucheness as a romantic comedy. No. This is one of the great explorations of the Astaire persona. Mr. Top Hat and Tails is put in a squalid army environment, and roundly subverts it with lies and disguises, injecting the surreal, and having startling homoerotic dreams. Furthermore, the 'gentleman' persona is exposed in primitive conditions is exposed as mendacious, cynical, cowardly, downright unpatriotic. Extraordinary."
4,What a beautifull couple.,"There can only be one Ginger Rogers. But after her, Rita Hayworth is an excelent partner for Fred Astaire. I have never been a fan of the ""military"" comedies or dramas, but this one is full of good moments. Ritas' performance is incredible and her timing is marvelous. They could have easily become the new duet for musicals in the fortys. It is a shame they only made two movies together.In a few words, an excelent movie, beautifull dancing and a great chemistry between Rita and Fred. I truly recomend this film."
4,You'll Never Get Rich,It is a fun flim. Fred Astaire is always at top form. You'll enjoy Fre the music and the comedy.
2,You'll Never Get Rich,"This is not one of Fred's better efforts, the dancing is so so and Rita Hayworth is among his poorest dance partners. Lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the Astaire/Rogers films. In spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching."
1,"Poorly developed, written and misleading.","Although the book is about Witchcraft, Magic and the Occult, as one browses through it one should immediately notice it acts more as a reference guide rather than any formal history. Crow gives capsulated accounts of, not just the title words, but any type of secret society, paranormal experience to ancient wonders and ancient history like cave men and apes and evolution. Why this has anything to do with the title is beyond me to answer. Very little references to go by with seemingly overall irrelevant information, or the information is generalized to the point of irrelevancy. There are so many books on withcraft, magic and occultism among the other subjects mentioned on the book that I would hardly reccomend this to anyone - not even as a beginner or starter book."
1,"Very one-sided, negative and uninformed about pagans/witches","(...) (This book) does not enlighten one about pagens, quite the opposite, it paints pagans and witches as evil and criminals.The only way I would recommend this book is as a sourse for the propaganda that is fed to the media and what causes christians to get so upset about the pagan religion. Know the enemy, so to speak. If you know garbage it is they are reading and beieveing, you'll know better how to explain to them how their info is not correct.Blessings."
3,mediocre product,"This product was a disappointment to me, might be a different experience for you. Thought it wasn't as sharp as was stated by other reviews. I'm a student, and I have learned one thing, If you participate in something you love to do regularly, which is cooking for me, then get the top of the line to do it with....I've had the pleasure of working with my instructor knives in class....which is a wusthof (hope I spelled it correctly) and it cuts and feels amazing. Go for the biggy if you prep, and fabricate food on a regular, just remember they also have a cheap line to be aware of....."
5,awesome,I love this movie. it's hard-to-find but it's a perfect father/sonmovie for father's dayannoymous
2,"This book is better than an owners manual, but not much.","Like many of the Haynes manuals I have read or used lately, too many different car models are included in the book. For problems that are truly hard to solve, the book is almost useless. The statements that ""this work is beyond the ability of most home mechanics and should be referred to the dealer"" often refers to just the thing that you need to know but are not told. It is a crude guide for working on your car."
5,It's A great Book For Easy Do-it-yourself Repairs,"It's OK for small problems and is very detailed, but for bigger problems I'd suggest takng your car to a certified repair shop!"
4,Pretty good,"This book isn't too bad, my professor reccomended it, which is why I got it. It's detailed and helpful, using good examples"
1,Unbelievably Bad Textbook,"Wow, so I've read my fair share of textbooks over the years but this takes the cake.This book is an utter piece of garbage, it's that bad.The authors ad extremely indirect. It takes 3 pages to essentially get a definition that could have been described in less than five sentences. The book lacks any sort of structure, it's probably the most difficult read I've come across. You'll find yourself reading it over and over trying to put the pieces together.Read one chapter and I will pretty much guarantee you will want to jab your pen into your own neck.I can't believe this is required text in my project management course.In three weeks when the semester ends, I will be tossing this piece of crap in my fireplace."
2,"Suffices, but expect to supplement","This book does not use enough detail to explain some of the concepts that turned out to be important in the class I was using it for. A prime example is its treatment of Earned Value Analysis, in which it is not made clear how some numbers are reached (PV, for example). Further, it really seems to be just a very expensive M$ Project manual. If you can avoid this book, do so."
1,"Great summary, I got all my interview questions answered. I should have read this book before the interview.","I bought this book to learn more about project schedule estimate. I am very satisfied with the book and spent the whole 2 weeks reading the whole book.I would look into taking some class in project management or even an MBA, but this book gave me very good fundamentals in my new job."
3,book review,This a great book. Although it focuses more on large scale projects like say writing a new software program. Also this is NOT a Microsoft Project guide. There is very little about that software (1 chapter portion) but it is good for all around PM tool usage and philosophy. READ ALL THE CASE STUDIES TOO...good insight.
3,Good!,"This is a very good book for understanding the fundamentals of project management. Concepts have been detailed appropriately. However, it should provide additional real-world examples as I found that a little lacking.Otherwise, not bad."
1,Worthless book,I don't recommend this book. The two authors don't blend well. The terminology seems to constantly change and never is consistent with PMI's PMBoK. Our professor will not be using this text again.
2,Just ok,I bought this text book and the PMP CD-ROM. I found out PMP CD-ROM is a lot easier to understand project managemnet framework. This text book is pretty difficult to understand.
2,"Reflection Tool, Not Practical Guide to Project Management","Jack R. Meredith and Samuel J. Mantel, Jr. have written an academic reference book about project management that is at times dry, theoretical, and boring to read. However, their book is at other times a good, interesting reflection tool for an experienced project manager. A green project manager will often have difficulty to relate the content of the book to his/her new practice. Based on my own experience, there is ultimately no better learning school than getting his/her hands ""dirty"" in the field under the supervision of an experienced project manager to learn the ropes of the job."
4,"Good content, needs a better editor","The PM content in this book is really great, but I can not rate it as 5-star quality because the editor to overlooked important corrections that were needed to the the Excel formulas and examples provided, thereby lessening their effectiveness. The problems following the learning content in each chapter are challenging, but some seem to be worded in a manner that is designed to intentionally confuse or trip up the reader rather than to reinforce learning.It was great to get the trial copies of Crystal Ball and MS Project with the book. Overall it is a good value, just be aware that some sloppy editing detracts from the quality of the book."
2,Good bed time reading,"This book is guaranteed to make you fall asleep. Some people take a glass of warm milk, others taking sleeping tablets; But this book has absolutely no side effects and is can make *anybody* fall asleep within 10 minutes! Try it for yourself..."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY - DO NOT BUY!,"This book makes learning Project management difficult. It does not clearly define anything. It is full of endless (and senseless) babble and author's ""opinions"" very few facts. I fully believe this is a required text because of the website Wiley created and the ""bonus"" cd of Project 2002. The website makes teaching the class a breeze, it gives the teacher quizzes and tests, therefore, the teacher doesn't have to muddle through the maze of crap to find out information. The quizzes are not general but tipically, ""what message did the author's try to convey on page such and such"".This book is not worth it!"
3,An Ok text book. Gets the general principles across.,"The book provides good insight into project management. Suitable for beginning or intermediate level. A few of the concepts and readings are quite out of date. The third edition was last copyrighted in 1995. This can be an eternity in the fast changing project management arena. An update, to include current (1999) concepts and techniques, could make this an excellent text instead of a good text."
2,NOT FOR THE PMP EXAM,I can not believe that PMI recommened this book for preparing for the PMP exam. It is not worth the money unless you know absoultely nothing about PM.
1,Worked great... for about 5 minutes.,"I ordered one of these Netgear USB Wifi dongles and plugged it into my computer's USB port. I found that it gave me a better signal than my internal PCI wifi card(also Netgear).The problem is that the adapter seems to shut itself off (the light turns off and all network activity stops) after a couple of minutes, at which point I have to unplug it and plug it back in again, over and over again every few minutes.I got this particular model because the price was good and Netgear has worked well for me in the past. This problem I'm having, however, makes this product a worthless waste of my time and shipping money (I'm getting a refund on the product itself). After reading the other negative reviews of this model, it looks like this is not just a fluke problem with my unit, so next time I'll try a different brand or model.You have been warned."
1,Bad product.,"I bought this at Radio Shack. It worked for a few days, reasonably well but not great. Then it just started losing the connection and having trouble re-connecting. I exchanged it for another and the same thing happened. Stay away."
1,Piece of crap,Don't buy this prodcut. It blue screens PC daily. The screen references the netgear drivers. Even though lots of people have this problem no fix from Netgear. That is crappy support. Don't fall for thier rebate mumbo jumbo you get what you pay for. Drop the Netgear box and run as fast away as possible!
3,Sketchy windows drivers,"I've only had this for a couple days, and so far it had been working alright for me. This morning, I wanted to play some online games so I brought out my command line and ping'd some nearby servers, but there wasn't any response. Then, when I tried to connect to the internet, nothing was hpapening. So, I thought I was having HW connection issues, so I updated the drivers. After reinstalling, and using the supplied netgear config utilities, same thing happened again, where the ping command messed up my internet connection.So, i reinstalled again and used the windows config utility, and the ping command no longer caused problems. also, i could see more servers when i looked for a game to connect to. long story short, don't use the netgear internet config utilities when it asks you, use the winxp netzero config or whatever it is called. and get the latest drivers cause the ones i had were 1.5 years old"
4,No problems; Can;t complain,"This review is a little old. I had already purchased the netgear router and one wireless adapter in January'06. But i needed a second one as I now have three computers in the house feeding off the same DSL internet connection.Performance is good. I live in a two storey concrete house , the laptop is at different locations around the house and the 2nd desktop is upstairs. Signal strength varies but generally both work well! installation was easy, no problems to date."
1,Not so good,"The range of reception on this USB 108 wireless adapter is not strong or reliable. I have always had great reception and speed using my Netgear 108 network card, but using the same computer and just changing to the USB adapter I have found that the reception and speed is not even an tenth as good as my original card. I will be returning the item. Unfortunately my PC's standard internal wireless card is better and faster than the Netgear USB.-- Sorry."
2,Apparently overheats; also fails for other reasons - not recommended,"I have had a good deal of trouble with the Netgear WG111T wireless USB adapter -- for three reasons:1. The Netgear software spontaneously quits on my Windows XP Professional system.2. The adapter appears to overheat. As others have mentioned, it then has to cool off before working again.3. The Netgear user support -- on the web and by phone -- is poor.Windows is a hostile networking environment to begin with. Microsoft has structured Windows to make it difficult, often impossible, to network with non-Windows computers. But even taking that into account, the Netgear adapter is poor."
4,works great/but installation may be an issue,"The Adapter works great. The only issue I had was when I tried to install it. I could not get it to work and when I called the Netgear help desk they did not want to support it at first because the item was made in 2002/2003. When I explained that I was not looking to replace it and that I was just trying to install it, the manager (yes I had to talk to a supervisor to get them to help) helped me install the correct driver."
1,JUNK - Dont waste your time,"Don't buy. I purchased this in May 2009 after doing my reasearch and getting written verification directly from NETGEAR that the adapter heating issues and disconnecting problems have been resolved.today, after numerous e-mails and phone calls they are replacing the unit. We shall now see once I receive yet another adapter.NOT WORTH THE GRIEF!!!"
4,"Good hardware, but buggy software","After months of trouble-free use, started experiencing system lockups. Took quite a while to figure out the problem didn't come from other hardware or software but from this! Reverting back to Smart-Wizard ver.1.1 solved lockups but connection drops intermittently and reconnect a few seconds later. Out of frustration, disabling Smart-Wizard all together and let Windows handle wireless connectivity; and so far no lockups and no drops for 2 days, very happy!! Other users experiencing this problem should give it a try."
1,Constant frusteration - I hate it,"This thing constantly overheats. I have to restart the computer 3 times a day just to reload the drivers. I can't transfer large files across my network, and I can't use P2P without it screwing up and requiring another restart.Go for it if you just want to browse the web. Anything else? Do not buy this product."
3,It works for me just fine.,"I have got this Netgear WG111T adapter for almost 2 years. It works just fine under Windows XP. Although it is a little warm, it never stops. I haved an AT&T's wireless router."
1,"Great when it works, but unfortunately very unreliable","It works swell until it starts automatically disabling itself. I suspect it simply overheats when this happens, although unplugging it from one USB port and plugging it into another gets it going again. If you view the Netgear forums topic ""Please Join here for WG111/WG111T/WG111U issues"", you'll see that this is a design flaw that shows up for many users.Don't bother getting this."
1,"Yes, this is a complete piece of junk.","I've had many Netgear products over the years, and in general I've been very happy with them. This WG111T is a disgraceful piece of junk though, overheating and frequently losing connections."
2,Netgear WG111T,I am disappointed in the performance of the product. It continues to disconnect without warning and does not remain activated for long periods of more than an hour.
4,Good purchase,I have enjoyed this product. It was definetly worth the money that I paid for it. I recomend it to anyone in need of an adapter.
3,You get what you pay for,"I'm writing this review a year after my purchase.Why?These were okay as far as department store type boxers go,but they don't come near the quality, fit, appearance and apparent durability ofwhat I just purchased:Brooks Brothers own brand.Sure they cost a bit more, but on sale...not much more.AND THE FIT!The waistband is at least twice as wide as the Jockeys and the elastic treads are woven tightly,suggesting many hours of dryer time ahead without stretching.The back of the boxers are ONE PIECE without seams.The material is heavy, tightly woven cotton,but not so heavy that they annoy or interfere with fit.Jockeys may be okay for children,but the Brooks Brothers are for men with mature waists.They are so comfortable,I ordered more and retired all my Jockeys to cleaning rags."
5,Scary...but fun!,"I don't understand all these idiot reviews: I was thrilled by the quality of this game! Lush, varied scenery, interesting characters, engrossing plot, and exciting, often frightening gameplay are but some of the perks to be found in Martian Gothic. True, the keyboard is your only means of control, but who cares? And, yes, it is a bit frustrating at times, but if you've got patience, a little brains, and want something more thought-provoking than a some shoot-em-up, you should enjoy this unique and thoroughly enjoyable game! I'm only about half of the way through, but it looks like it's only going to get better! NOTE: this does deserve it's M rating, but oh well, right?"
3,This is Fun if you have LOTS of time to spare.,"This game looked pretty cool before i bought it! What happened. you get playing pretty scary stuff. Then the non-dead start wakin up again and again and again. The plots pretty cool but the controls and amount of time put into it [stinks]! I liked the environment, thought the music and dialougue was good but thats it. Other than the storyline this game [stinks]. Not to mention the Damn Trimorphs, critters, Mood, and the coumputer voice. And we all know how annoying it is when the non-dead keep attacking and never let go. If you don't mind spending money get this. If you want to save your money it would be a good idea. all in all this games ok."
1,This Game ...,I have been dying to get this game for a while and when I did i beaten it in one day and get this you kill zombies they'll get back up later. And when it said three will enter and two will leave everyone lives. The controls suck to. But this game deserves a star for the graphics. Kenzo sounds retarded and Karne breathes deep after each word. DO NOT GET THIS GAME NO MATTER WHAT EVERYONE SAYS you will regret it. Trust a true gamer and please do not spend ten bucks. THE PSX VERSION ... TO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.thank you for your time
3,SAVE YOUR MONEY: NEW 2CD DELUXE FSM EDITION NOW AVAILABLE!,"Film Score Monthly released the 1976 Reprise Records album master of King Kong in 2005 when no additional material was available. However, FSM has now released anexpanded 2CD King Kong set.In cooperation with Paramount Pictures, John Barry's complete score, newly-mixed & mastered from the 2"" 24-&-16-track masters appear on Disc 1. The Reprise album master on disc 2, augmented with several film alternates.So, don't waste your money on this older version!"
1,Terribly Exhausting,"I didn't even want to put a scale of 1, but the comment wouldn't let me proceed further. Before you purchase this book, I might suggest a book of crosswords for imagination, than to spent precious money on this book. Be wise and move on."
4,Good but not exact,"This book is very well written. McBeth has laid a good foundation if you are interested Baptist History. The only problem I have found is McBeth allows his own personal views to skew what he calls history and what he has decided to include in this book. Rather than giving a full account of what History says about Baptist, McBeth tells most of the story. Other than that, VERY well written and easy to read. Don't be intimidated by the number of pages. McBeth focuses on a few things that you can skip and not miss anything. Hope you enjoy reading this book and will look further into history. McBeth mentions a good book to give you another side of Baptist History; ""The Trail Of Blood"". It is out of print but you can still find some copies out there. While it also is not exact it gives you another side. Good Luck and God Bless!"
5,Baptist Roots: Getting at the Truth of Our Heritage,"This has to be the best, all inclusive study on ""Baptist Heritage"" that I have found. While enlightening in areas of Baptist roots, it also does a wonderful job dispelling many of the myths that have crept into the Baptist Church as to its beginnings. It is a must for anyone interested in the beginnings of the Baptist Church and the forming of their doctrinal statements of faith."
4,Good condition,"This book was in the condition as it was described. For a used book, it met my expectations and I am looking forward to reading it."
1,Kindle edition terrible,"Haven't finished reading yet, but font is horrible and letters are incomplete in kindle edition for iPad. This makes for a terrible read. I will be requesting refund. Come on, join the digital age and give me something useful!"
5,Excellent Resource for IT Support,"As a healthcare IT Systems integrator, I found this book to be an excellent overview of the concepts, terminology, workflow and standards involved in PACS & RIS.It is readable, illustrated and understadnable. It does not drone on in esoteric concepte, but addresses PACS in practical, relevant ways."
5,STUNNING !,"The long awaited return of Stero MC's ""Deep, Down & Dirty"" is a mind-blowing album that sounds like no other act does in dance music.Listening to this album you'll realize how influential this guys were for a whole era of music and continue to be. There's not even one bad track here. From the mesmerizing title track to the set's final piece ""Shameless"" it's a 50 minute of amazing techno-funk and groove.Worth every penny and the nine year wait! Listened to it 3 times back-to-back when i first got it and seems to be impossible to get enough of. Not only the best album of the year but also the best album of the past 2 years and most probably the next 2.You're a fool if you miss it!!!"
5,Should be assigned in all first year community college classes,"Dr. Cannon has produced a book that is both a valuable teaching tool and enjoyable to read. How To Flunk Out of a Community College would be an outstanding selection for ""freshman experience"" programs, ""guidance studies"" classes, basic reading and writing skills classes, any ""mentoring"" programs, and as supplemental reading for classes that deal with the issue of decision making. By infusing the perspectives of instructors with her own brand of student-centered humor, Dr. Cannon has provided all students with a text that gives them the basic rules for academic (and personal) success in a concise, readable, and memorable format.Highly recommended!!"
1,WTF Ultraviolet digital copy??? Shame on Amazon,"This movie is what it is, a funny movie......SHAME ON AMAZON for allowing Warner Bros. market this movie as having a ""digital copy"".ULTRAVIOLET calls it a digital copy. IT IS NOT A DIGITAL COPY. It's a STREAMING copy. Not the same in my lexicon. I use streaming all the time. I do not confuse it with a digital copy. OTHERWISE a funny movie and very entertaining. Many times when I buy a movie, the ""digital copy"" option is a deciding factor. This is because I can view it on my iPad, or phone as well as TV or computer. Streaming demands that your device has an unlimited data plan. I have problems with the Ultraviolet 'streaming' method. If you decide you want to view the movie twice you're out of luck. As far as I'm concerned, Warner Bros., as well as Amazon.com owes me a digital copy of this movie."
1,"my eyes, my eyes!","It can best be described as ""Midnite Express"" meets ""Deliverance."" Unpleasant is an understatement.Each character has been morphed into a wanker. Who OK'd this script? Not one laugh and I'm into it half an hour.To those of you who have already viewed this, I'm so sorry. Oh gawd, they just showed a tranny prostitute with breasts and a penis. Full frontal. Yes, this must be the Deliverance homage part. Aauugh! This movie is beyond horrible!"
1,The Hangover Part II [HD],"I am still mad at myself for watching the entire movie! Save yourself! Don't rent or buy this movie. It is repulsive and not at all funny! On the other hand, the online video playback experience was right on."
1,Three Words,"Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Instructions require these reviews to contain at least 20 words. So besides it being a really terrible movie, i would only add that I like these types of movies in general. But this one was....terrible."
2,Tired sequel,"Entertaining enough in certain parts, but most of it felt self-referential, canned, and scripted. Hope the cast were paid well."
5,Hangover Part II,"Hahahahahahahah, funny movie!! Loved it, not recommended for kids but it was a very funny movie probably liked it better than the first one."
3,Good But Predicable,Even though you pretty much can guess what's coming next in the movie it was still worth the $ to see it.
2,"Ehh, it's ok","This movie wasn't for me. It was a Christmas gift I bought someone for last year. It doesn't live up to original, then again, whta sequel does?"
2,An extension fo the first...A poor extension,"This movie was just like watching more of the first one. But they made it more unbelievable and ridiculous. There were a few funny spots, but overall, I'd prefer watching the first one over and over again than seeing this movie."
3,EH....,"Like most sequels, this one didn't quite hit the laughs of the first. I recommend red box or TV for this one."
4,Good CD,"It was a good sequil to the first Hangover, but not quite as funny, as it follows the same theme as the first one. Still worth getting."
4,good movie,i got this movie to watch on the air plane. it was very good and funny as hell from start to finish
1,I cannot stand movies like this!,"I hate this movie and the first one, but the guys in my life like it, so I got it for them for Christmas. Believe me, though, it was DEFINITELY not by choice. It's just not my type of movie."
3,I thought it was pretty funny,"Yes, it is the EXACT same plot in almost every single way. This film is just another excuse for them, to continue the magic of first Hangover's success. Don't expect it to BLOW your mind with hilarity. But it definitely has its moments. Some very dumb moments too (Useless use of a helicopter, too.) But, I think its worth buying."
1,I HATE ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY!!!,"SOO MAAND BECAUSE ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPIES ARE ""NOT ELIGIBLE TO REDEEM IN MY REGION""???!!!! ALL OTHER MOVIES SPECIALLY THE DISNEY ONES HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS!! I HAVE ABOUT 4 MOVIES THAT CAME WITH UV THAT I CANT REDEEM! JUST PUT A DIGITAL COPY TO REDEEM IN THE MOVIE AND DONT GO FANCY WITH BELLS AND WHISTLES!!"
1,Horrible,One star is one too many for this movie. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time writing a review. Maybe to warn others out there that this movie is just horrible tripe. Save your time and your money.
1,Ultraviolet SUCKS!!!,"Good movie, bad move on the part of Warner Brothers... I like having my movies in iTunes, it's unfortunate that WB would pull a 180 from their previous releases. DO NOT BUY!"
2,I AM GLAD,"I am glad I did not have to spend money to go to a movie theater to see this awful, awful movie. This is not a comedy. This is a filthy, dark movie. I gave it 2 stars for the efforts of flying all the way to Thailand. The rest is real Garbage with capital G. It seems that there are very few comedy writers left in Hollywood nowadays. It is such a pity to see so much money spent to produce such garbage. The movie put me in a very bad mood for several hours. No wonder, a lot of people are quitting going to the movies. What I hated the most about this movie, was the total lack of creativity. Very boring and repetitious. Too bad. The acting was actually pretty good, but the plot and storyline, was very, very bad. I bet a 4th grader could have come up with a better plot and writing."
1,Ultraviolet = Crap,Beware that Ultraviolet on this is for streaming only. You can not download this and take it with you anywhere. You need wi-fi for this to work. Send a message to the studios and do not buy this ultraviolet nonsense. You've been warned.
1,Ultra-Violet sucks,The only reason I purchase movies or Blu-Ray disc's is for the Digital Copy. It typically is around the same price as downloading it from Itunes plus I still get the discs. Ultra-Violet prevents you from using Apple TV or putting the movie on your I-pad when you are travelling on a plane.
1,Super Hated It,"My friend asked me if I had seen this movie since I will be traveling to Thailand soon. I was excited to see Thailand but, wow, now I almost feel sick after watching it. Unless you are a 12-year-old boy, I'd skip this one."
1,Not buying solely because of UltraViolet,I really want this movie but won't buy it purely on principal that it comes with crappy ultra violet digital copy which sucks. I WILL NOT BUY A SINGLE MOVIE THAT OFFERS A ULTRA VIOLET COPY...
1,Who finds this funny?,"How did this movie make so much money? There's not a single natural funny situation or line of dialogue. It's all forced, every situation is extreme and the dialogue is way over the top. I don't even know what to say to those that find this funny. No pace, actors all mailed it in. No one even tried, yet it broke records. What does that say about the common man in this Country? Bridesmades -- funny; Stepbrothers -- funny; Hangover 1 or 2 -- freaking terrible"
1,DIE ultraviolet DIE!!!,"Being stuck on airplanes most of the time this ultraviolet ""fake digital copy"" is useless! Wifi is usually 10 bucks to use so again there's more. They should NOT be able to call them digital copies! They are online copies! Just buy the Blu ray version. They can get the ultraviolet crap version back and use them for coasters!"
1,Horrible excuse for a sequal.,"My title says it all. Avoid this movie like the flu. It is just the same thing as the first one, but in Thailand. Not worth the money at all. It's a rental at best......actually, save the $5 and get some frozen yogurt."
2,Sequel Fail,"I liked the first Hangover because it was new and unexpected. This sequel was a lame attempt at recreating the same schtick. Maybe a few funny parts, but a lot of vulgarity with absolutely no comedic value whatsoever IMO."
2,That was a comedy?,"The movie is almost a copy of the first, except that the funny parts are missing. It's like a bad remake.**(Not much of a) Spoiler: Stu's getting married, Alan inadvertently drugs everyone, they wake up not remembering a thing. Chow pops up naked. They figure things out, get to the wedding last minute, Stu stands up for himself, Mike Tyson shows up.Seriously."
1,5 star movie one star for the crap ultraviolet,"the movie was great laughed all the way thru it but the one star is for the crap ultraviolet ""digital copy"" doesnt work with itunes is not a digital copy its a streaming only but i bought the region free copy off amazon.co.uk which comes with a true digital copy and price works out about the same"
5,Better than I expected!,"I actually enjoyed it as much as the first. I heard a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but I actually caught myself laughing out loud through out the movie. It was very funny...Just let it ride and enjoy."
4,"Not quite as funny as the first, but still funny!","The first Hangover will never be matched. The second Hangover was still funny. I thought the beginning was a bit slower than the first, but once they 'woke up' the next morning, it was pretty good. Definitely going in my DVD library."
1,AN AWEFUL SEQUAL THAT SHOULD'T HAVE BEEN MADE!!!!!!!!,"This movie is the most unoriginal, humorless movie I have seen in a long time. the story line is pretty much same as the first one but instead of Vegas it happens in a more exotic place with not many funny lines or scenes. I think the only time that I cracked a smile were scenes with the drug dealing monkey. This movie deserves negative stars but since this rating system is flawed I have to give it one star.... WARNING... DO NOT WAST YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS AWEFUL MOVIE!!!!!!"
1,Loved the Movie Hate the UV Digital Copy,"Loved the Movie Hate the Ultraviolet Digital Copy of the film.Ultraviolet Digital copies are not compatible in iTunes or even windows media devices.A customer is not always in an area that has an Internet connection to watch the streaming Digital copy.I travel over 200 days out of the year. Plains charge a service to use their Internet so now the copy is no longer free, as do Hotels, Airports and Train stations.The digital devices we purchase were designed to give us the freedom to take our entertainment with us not to be tethered to an Internet connection."
1,Horrible,"I was a huge fan of the first movie. I must have seen it in the theaters 4-5 times. When I heard there was going to be a second (and third and fourth) movie made I was very excited. This movie just didn't compare. As many people had said before me, the humor/jokes/plot points were all recycled from the first movie. That isn't my main complaint though. The jokes in the first movie seemed natural and just flowed. In this movie they really felt scripted and you could really tell they were TRYING to be funny. I just couldn't enjoy it."
1,waste of time and $5,Loved the first one so we thought we would enjoy the second. WRONG. Plot is same as the first only not so funny. Full frontal nudity is getting old. Alan is mean and rude and generally unlikable. Not much to laugh about that hasn't been done before.
1,Terrible,"We rented this for a dollar at the Red Box, I feel ripped off. This was such a horrible movie. Watch the first one, forget about part two."
2,I never seemed to find it funny.,"I never seemed to find this movie funny. It was full with adult humor which didn't appeal to me. Yes, I have seen the first movie, but it wasn't as sexually humorous. And the language in the movie is definitely not what you go to a movie theater and expect to hear. Yeah, I'm okay with a couple 'he**' and a few 'da**' some places, but I definitely never would let my child see this movie. It just doesn't seem funny. I am not saying that you shouldn't see this movie, I'm just saying that you are now WARNED! DO NOT SEE IT IF YOU DON'T LIKE SEXUAL HUMOR AND/OR A LOT OF CURSING/CUSSING!"
3,Worth Watching,"I really wasn't going to watch this movie because I had heard it was just like the first one, but, I'm glad I did it was funny!"
3,Too Much The Same,"I had high expectations for this movie, but the writers definitely showed that they do not have much of a creativity jump. I understand that this is a sequel but there are a lot of plot lines that are the same with something removed and something added (to not give any spoilers). It made me laugh a few times but for the most part it was predictable if you seen the first one. I quickly got annoyed with the repetition in story lines from part 1 to part 2 (from beginning to end and in about the same order). This would definitely be a rent before buying type movie, and I figured that the writers were pressing with a sequel to such a unique movie. I loved the first one but this one kind of takes a little bit of that love away too, because it left a bad taste in my mouth after feeling that I got ripped off for buying it, since it was essentially the same movie, with weaker humor, in my opinion."
2,Came up short,The beginning was more of a slap stick comedy with Alan being more of an idiot than previously believed to be. Disappointing......
2,Only a few laughs this time,"This sequel tries to take the first movie to Bangkok but just cannot deliver the laughs, although the actors try their best. Not much else to say."
1,A huge disappointment,"Those expecting to see more of the same in this sequel to the highly-successful original will be very disappointed. While the first Hangover movie was a side-splitting, wild ride, this sequel was devoid of any humor and had a dark tone that made for a very unpleasant viewing experience. In this go-round, the characters seemed joyless and the director relied on girlish screams to try to induce laughter (didn't work)instead of giving the characters actual funny situations to deal with. Especially annoying was the character of Alan who turned into a mean-spirited version of his former self. I had to watch the original after watching this wretched sequel just to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
4,I NEVER GET TO KEEP THE MONKEY,"There is a certain amount of predictability in this film, which is not really bad. The movie picks up 2 years later. Ed Helms is getting married in Thailand (pronounced Thigh-land). His future father-in-law hates him. His wife has a 16 year old brother who is pre-med. Ed wisely chooses not to have a bachelor party or invite Alan (Zach Galifianakis) along. He is talked into inviting Alan who worships the time the ""Wolf Pack"" was together. Of course once the guys get back together and raise their glasses in a toast...The movie uses the same formula as the first one. It takes a seemingly impossible situation and reconstructs a humorous story around it. Their mission in this episode is to locate Teddy, the pre-med student. On par with the first film.F-bomb, nudity, she-male nudity, crude humor, n-word, Ed Helms bent over and taking it up the..."
4,I like it :),Well nevermind about the UltraViolet Digital Copy. The Movie was pretty good and I kinda liked it better than the first movie. Yes I have read all the bad and good reviews and the only suggestion I can make to you is to buy it and figure it out yourself. I know a lot of people do not have the same likes and dislikes in movies. I happen to love watching movies and this one was good. If you liked the 1st movie you will of course love watching this one as well and it will make you laugh. I even want to watch it again this weekend.
3,Avoid Ultraviolet Digital Copy and get it from AmazonCo.UK,"Avoid Ultraviolet Digital Copy and get it from AmazonCo.UK. It is a region free Bluray, DVD and REAL Digital Copy. Ultraviolet Digital Copy is complete garbage and I will never buy any movie that has it. As many have already stated there are so many things fundamentally wrong with Ultraviolet Digital Copy that I'm not going to waist my time explaining them all.Get the UK version instead!"
1,UltraViolet is no good! Don't buy!,"UltraViolet digital download is no good, you have to create accounts and it will not work with itunes. In order to watch the movie on your computer you have to download a software, you can only watch using their software or stream onto devices. I made the mistake of purchasing the Green Lantern with UltraViolet and learned the hard way. Buy just the BluRay."
1,Not cool,"A rehash of the first film, almost to the T. Seriously, you guys were drugged and had another incomprehensibly crazy adventure. It sucks that this film had zero originality."
1,Okay Movie. Worthless Digital Copy.,"""Digital Copy"" does not exist. You can ""stream"" through Ultraviolet's crappy service. No internet connection? No digital copy. JUNK. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Beware not a true digital copy,This review is strictly for the format as the movie is as funny as the first one. I wish I read the reviews first but not needing a review on the movie I did not think I needed to read them. I expected a true digital copy as with most Blu-rays that I could download into ITunes but this is not that. It is some horrible Ultraviolet digitial that forces you to create a Flixster account and download software to view a streaming or local copy.I am going to return this to Amazon and wait until a real digital version is available or just buy the cheaper blu-ray with no digital copy if available.
1,copy cat movie,"I loved hangover #1, but the second one was not very impressive. the entire movie was a copy cat of #1 just in a different place. It probably would have been better if they came up with some new ideas, but they just kept with the same ideas, but shot in a different location. This was a waste of film and money.Would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Horrible waste of time and money,"I really, really liked the first Hangover. I have watched it several times and still enjoy it. This second movie was a huge dissappointment. The jokes and plot were like leftovers that have gone bad. The characters were just annoying this second time around. I don't know why they made such a fuss of Mel Gibson, he might have actually added something to the move. If you don't have Hangover 1, get that movie instead."
3,The Hangover Part II (Movie-Only Edition + UltraViolet Digital Copy,The quality of the DVD was fine. I just didn't enjoy the movie as much as I thought I might. It was more coarse than I expected.
2,Was ok,Not as good as the first one but funny I love Steve G. He is halarious so anything with him is great. I liked it
1,Not as good as the first one,"I had gigantic hopes for this movie, it failed them. I think the only aspect that made this movie worth while was Zach Galifianakis."
2,Felt like I was watching the first one again,I guess Todd Phillips and crew must of ran out of ideas because they pretty much recycled the first movie screenplay and set it in Thailand. Some funny bits. Worth the 3.99 for streaming but it's nothing special.
2,A complete waste of time.,"Not even funny. I think I laughed twice the entire movie. Very poorly executed, unoriginal, and almost a complete copy-cat of the original. But this time around the jokes weren't funny. This was obviously nothing more than a cash cow for the studio."
1,NO MORE ULTRAVIOLET,"Yeah you can watch it on your computer, but you have to download the flixster collections application and run it there; you can't run it in iTunes?!"
1,No iTunes Digital Copy :(,"I enjoyed buying the BluRay + DVD + iTunes digital copy versions of movies. Mainly wanted the iTunes version, getting the BluRay disc was just an added bonus. If I can't play the movie on AppleTV or iOS devices, it is useless to me. Guess I'll just have to buy the digital only versions from iTunes. Oh yeah, saw the movie in the theater, pretty funny."
1,ooops I did it again,"If you enjoyed Hangover I, don't watch this. Why? Because it would ruin the first one for you and make you question the sanity of the director. Before renting this, I thought hey this movie has an interesting split in reviews.... So I decided to rent and see for myself.... OMG I could not finish it, that's how bad it was ...What is number II about? Well, it is the same story, yes, S,A,M,E - only instead of a tiger, there is a monkey, and instead of a tooth missing, a finger is, and instead of missing a third friend, a fourth one is, .... Yup, oh but wait, here is the catch, it ain't in Vegas, it's in Bangkok - that's the only hint of creativity ....You really need to be stoned to enjoy any parts of this movie - I like these guys, but the director wanted to make a quick buck too fast, too easy... Well, Too bad!I would give it a zero if I could, because it is disappointing to let a good first movie go so bad so fast."
1,Digital Copy from Flixster Hangover Part II,"I purchased this digital copy along with my DVD, but had I known what Flixster was all about I would not have. I wanted a digital copy I could download to my ipad and my ipod. So Flixster sent me a digital copy, but when I tried to download it through itunes it would not work. So I contacting Flixster again. Again they sent me another digital copy. And when I tried to download again through itunes, again it did not work. I brought this movie back on December 9 and here it is February 1 and still I do not have a digital copy. I am so fed up with this. I will just go buy a digital copy somewhere other than Flixster for sure from now on. This is the first time a have written a review on anything. I am just so furstrated with this. It is not complicated to send a digital copy that works. I have downloaded digital copies before and since. I just do not understand why I can not seem to get a working digital copy from Flixster. The movie was good and very funny."
1,unbelievably bad,"if you think funny is watching a grown man cry like a blubbering little girl because his ""buddy"" told him they are no longer friends, then you will find this movie hilarious. this must have been written by high school kids... no wait - 8th graders!! I was a huge fan of the Hangover (1st one) and I when I heard they were coming out with a sequel, I couldn't wait! however, after watching this drivel, this movie was absolutely pathetic! it was the opposite of funny. same plot, but the writing was completely dumbed down. really mindless humor... I think the ""Ernest"" movies are funnier than this and I hate Vern! the only reason this movie was made is one reason: MONEY. they knew no matter how bad a movie it was, with the success of Hangover 1, they would rake in the dough... I don't know how it did in the box office (it was a Netflix rental), but I do know I'm glad I didn't waste my theater money watching it. don't waste your time on this crap."
1,stinker,"These actors should be embarressed to have released this piece of junk.My wife left the room in the middle of it and my son and I felt sick after watching it.It has no originality,has gross scenes with a ""HE-SHE"" and is over the top stupid."
1,"replay of the first movie, except not funny.","This movie was a huge waste of time. It's just not funny. I normally LOVE all of these actors, and I did enjoy the first movie, but this is embarrassing. I think I have a hangover."
1,Hangover part II,"the movie shipped throughout the movie...not a good DiscI'm sure the movie was good, if the disc wasn't bad"
2,Awful ... substituted crude for funny,"First movie was about 10 times better than this and had me laughing from start to finish. This one was poorly written, too crude, and forced to be funny rather than naturally so in the first movie. DUMB. Disappointing."
1,what a waste,"turned it off after the 1st hour having not laughed or even chuckled once. what a waste - terrible sequel, and too bad since the first one was so funny!"
3,Funny but Beyond Vulgar,"If you liked the first movie, you will probably like this one because they are virtually the same. I knew this going in based on the reviews, and since I knew what to expect I still found most of it hilarious. However, the vulgarity was beyond extreme. It did not help the story and was not funny. In fact it took away from the movie for me. The first one had its moments of raunchiness, but this one took it too far."
5,Hilarious...,"If you're into crude rude and nasty humor ( and who isn't?) than this movie is for you! Nothing can ever live up to the first Hangover, but it does a good job trying! Mr. Chow is the best in this installment!"
5,The Hangover Part II,Thank you very much for the movie The Hangover Part Two. These movies are some of the funnies movies ever.
5,Great Movie,The movie was just as promised. It was hilarious! and I love the digital copy (actually I think this one had UltraViolet [but same thing]) option that comes along with the movie!
1,HANGOVER 2 IS GREAT...ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY SUCKS!,"Ultraviolet digital copy is a waste of time and my money. I hate that I had to download ANOTHER program that doesn't even work. I haven't been able to view the final Harry Potter and now I can't even see the Hangover 2. Flixster is a pain in the a$$! Don't waste your money on the Blu-ray, DVD & digital copy combo...just get the regular Blu-ray disk!"
2,its no joke the movie is great! ultraviolet sucks,THE ULTRAVIOLET THING SUCKS BIG ONES THEYR NOT JOKING! I made the mistake you can only watch it when online
3,Not the best Hangover movie in the series but still funny.,When Hangover 2 was release in theaters it was a most see for me. I laughed out loud and said its just like the first movie. After watching it a second time I notice it wasnt funny as the first. The story line is similar. one could guess where the Brother in law will be. The movie does live up to the series but might need a new story line. Just hope the third one is better than the second one.
5,great movie,i don't know why people thought that this was not a grade one comedy. i have seen lots of moviesand this was a great sequel. every bit as good as the first film. the first one was more of asurprise. i was expecting a lot and this one delivered. i loved it. perhaps because i havebeen in bangcock. but not really. it was a great plotted and delivered film. don't miss it.
5,"Who you talking trash about, this movie is amazing!",I don't know what it is about some people but there seems to be a lot of trash talking of this film. It's a comedy. It's supposed to be funny and it's supposed to be ridiculous and that's exactly what this does. Sure the first one was unexpected so it was that much funnier and the set-up is kind of planned but the jokes are still hilarious and all the guys are super funny. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a really good laugh on the cheap.
2,One of the Worse Sequels Ever!,"Two stars is really to generous! I think this is one of the worse sequels ever. It brings nothing new to the table. Talk about a pitiful sequel. They didn't even bother to write a new story. It is basically the same story minus the humor. It is so bad. I don't think there is a single scene as good as one in the first movie. I also wonder why no bad guys in the movie were Thai only foreigners as they call them in Thailand. If you've seen the first movie, I'd say this movie is a 1 star. If you didn't see the first maybe you could give it a 2 stars, because it may seem a little funny."
3,ok,"Decent movie! Little too much of Ken Hong naked. Funny, not as good as the first but is a sequal ever?! Still worth buying and watching!"
2,Adventures in Babysitting 2,"Where's Teddy, where's Teddy? You know, I just don't care about finding Teddy. The jokes are so mediocre. Completely boring until halfway through the movie, when the money transfer plot begins. I again lost interest, however, near the end of the film. Most of the antics the characters get into are cheesy and just plain dumb; i.e. started a bar fight, went to a strip club, did drugs and stuffed someone in an ice box, etc.The overall plot, aside from finding Teddy, was actually interesting, but the lame jokes and acting brought down the fun factor a lot."
1,"Why bother? Oh yeah, to rake it in...","This was a waste of my time. Re-hash of the same plot from the first movie, just changed up the scenery.Very disappointing. There are probably some fans of this, but you got to admit there was nothing original about this movie in comparison to the first Hangover film."
2,Hangover Part 2,"Sophmoric humor part 2. Will appeal to men in the under 35 age. Way TOO MUCH use of the ""F"" word. I bought this product with the Bridesmaids, and Hangover."
2,Boring,I think the best word to describe this movie would be 'boring'. It appears the thought of spending more than 5 hours developing a script was just too much for the writers.
3,"Entertaining movie, but Ultraviolet is a joke","The movie is for mature audiences and humorous, yet basically a remake of the original. I am not happy with the Ultraviolet, which i can't just download like a digital copy. I have to go through the manufacturers site, jump through hoops, and agree to some shady rights policy. I like the ""digital copy"", which is much easier to use. Don't recommend UltraViolet."
3,Ultra Violet Digital Copy No Thanks,"The Movie was great. Quality of the blu-ray's sound and video, great. Ultra Violet Digital Copy, ehhhhh. You have to create an ""Ultra Violet"" account, and a ""Flixster"" account, then download an app for every portable device you would like to watch your videos on. And even though you can now download the movies onto your computer or portable device I had trouble downloading it onto my iPad and my iPod. Not a big fan at all. I also like to manage all my media with iTunes, I just have to download a movie once, and can sync it quick and easy to any of my iOS devices. I hope this Ultra Violet Digital copy business is just a fad that will go away soon. Or give us an option to choose iTunes downloads."
5,Hilarious movie,"This is a great comedy that always has me laughing anytime I watch it! I will admit it isn't as good as the first movie, but it's still great!"
4,great movie,"great movie, not as funny as the first one,but still funny.i had to get it to go with my blu ray collection"
5,Fantastic Seller,Definitely will order from this seller again. Shipped quickly and as described on website. Did not need to contact the seller.
1,Stunk,"If you liked the first Hangover, you might not like this one as it is not funny or very original. One and done for me. No desire to re-watch. I ended up selling this this one to a store that resells movies... it may just sit on their shelves forever :)"
1,Warning!! UV sucks,"If you have a rooted android phone, you CAN'T stream the movies to it because it's a security issue!!! GIVE ME A BREAK!!! Wow.. Just give us back our itunes copies!! I can easily just handbrake the movie for myself! I'm pretty sure studios know this so what's the point of trying to use UV as a solution to pirating. Glad Disney isn't on board for this garbage format!! It's shouldn't be called digital copy. Sure you can't download it but only to your pc or non rooted device but I just can't upload the movie via itunes to my ipad because of these new format.!! How can I stream with no Wi-Fi or data service around? Idiots!! Cloud is only good if there's service...ULTRAVIOLET IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE. SHOULD BE CALL ULTRAVIOLET STREAM."
1,This movie truly Sucked...!,"This is one of the worst sequels ever, really. I thought this movie was going to be amazing lol I could barely finish watching it, it's awful."
1,No funny material here..,"This movie is so bad that I am actually upset with myself for wasting the money on it. I bought both of the Hangover movies anticipating an enjoyable back to back escape from reality after having surgery and taking my pain meds. While the first one barely passed for humor, this movie actually had very little to do with humor and IMHO the actors should have refused to do the material as it is so stupid. I didn't laugh during the film and I was under medication. The acting/actors in this film are the worst and I'm pretty sure they will not be seen again for even going along with this plot. If you think you want to waste the time to watch either of the Hangover movies wait for a few weeks as these things will be selling for $1.00 in the bargain bins."
1,Nothing like the first one,"One of the worst movies I've seen. Amazon was great, but this movie was not. Nothing like the first movie. The reviews you see online are accurate. For some reason, I thought they all couldnt be. Avoid this movie."
4,Alright movie,"The Hangover partII is not good as part 1.It was a little boring to me, but it did have some funny parts."
2,First one is better.,"The movie is the same as the first one, someone from the crew ends up getting lost just when the wedding day is a few days apart.Pros:Good laugh scenesFunny but gross scenesCons:Ultra violet copy wont transfer ipod (useless)"
2,Hangover II,"Too much swearing, got old really quick, preferred the first one much more, it was actually funny and fun to watch."
1,avoid ultraviolet digital copies,"Ultraviolet digital copies are more trouble than they are worth.That being said, this movie was terrible. It took everything that was funny about the first one and pushed it too far. The original movie was very funny, but this one was just gross. It was like hearing a joke being retold by someone who can't tell jokes. One star."
2,How much do you get for recycling movies anyhow?,"If it is 99 cents, rent it and there are a few laughs. But, it's best said as such: If you play this movie in reverse, I hear you can see the first movie.Too much was too similar."
3,"Same Old, but Still Funny!","I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He saw the first and was really looking forward to the second one. We both laughed, but in all reality it was the exact same movie as the first just set in Thailand."
2,Monkey was the Best,"The best thing about this movie was seeing Bradley Cooper walking around in shades and a loose button up. Only the best part was supposed to be the laughter. For me, the entire movie only had two scenes that literally made me burst out laughing. The rest fell so flat. The characters are annoying, not funny. The monkey played a better part. I hate to give bad reviews but I also hate to waste my money. I'd take Bradley Cooper in Limitless anyday. Another Hangover, not so much."
1,Just a horrible movie.,"The same jokes as the first movie, yet less funny. This sequel is the definition of ""mailing it in."" Do not waste your money."
3,ok movie,"This is an okay movie, def. not as good as the the first one. I didn't find myself laughing as much and was really let down. I would rent this film before you decide to fork out the money and buy it. I hope they don't decide to make a third."
1,DO NOT BUY ANY ULTRAVIOLET DG WB MOVIES!!!!!!!!,"I had the same problem with the Green Lantern Blue Ray-The UV digital copy is a piece of crap!!!!! It will not play on the ipod like promised. I wrote them a very long email asking them to refund my money and that I would never buy any dvd's from them again if they chose to keep providing us with this falsely advertised digital copy! I was lucky and they sent me a code to download the movie from iTunes. So maybe try that, and once they get enough of those emails, they will realize their mistake in switching over to this UV/Flixter crap!!!! Let our voices be heard!!"
1,waste of time and money,The original hangover was funny and good. This part II completely failed. It was absolute waste of money and my time. Amazon's on demand streaming over Roku box was seamless though.
1,Hungover,"How many ways can you go wrong in a comedy movie ? Watch this steaming pile and find out. So first start with a ""lost time"" premise and beat the hell out of it, fill it with sub par acting,poor comedic timing and even lamer jokes and you have this poor excuse for a film. This has to be the worst sequel ever ! I really hope there isn't ging to be a third !"
1,"Ugh, so glad I only rented...","Terrible, such a sad lazy rip off! The first one still makes me laugh, this one just makes me want my 4 dls. back."
1,NOT GOOD,"I was disappointed in this movie. It tried very hard to replicated the zaniness of the original and fails badly,, The writing is poor...with poor puns...and plays on words being used to help the comedy along...The story is too close to the original version, and Zack Galifinakis seemed underutilized,,,being given poor comedic lines and plot opportunities. I am a fan of Zack...but this was not a good effort from him..his character was largely irrelevant...Teaching a real monkey how to smoke a cigarette..That is supposed to be funny? No."
1,"Sorry for you if you purchased this movie, if you received it as a gift OMG!!!","The first Movie was Great. This second one was totally stupid. I forced myself to laugh once. The acting was lame, story line had promise, writer and producers should be embarrased. Mike Tyson singing!! Give me a break. I am most thankful that I waited to rent this from Redbox. Only out of a buck and change.Not stuck with a movie that even Goodwill would refuse as a donation."
1,UltraViolet is sucks!!! don't waste your money buy this edition,"Ultraviolet Digital copies are not compatible in iTunes !!!! every time you watch it, you need an Internet connection. which means you are not able to watch in plant, subway any place without wifi!!!! BTW even you willing to watch with internet or 3G connection you need to sign up for two website!!!"
2,Its just bad.,"The Hangover Part II is almost an exact copy of the first. Sure the second had one or two moments, but when you basically play Ad-Libs with the first script, you get this monster."
2,Very predictable,"There were some funny parts but it was too much like the first one in story line, so much in fact that it was easy to predict what was going to happen next which took the fun out of it for me."
4,Lively and upbeat debut,"Well worth it, if you like gospel music; these sisters are sure to be around for years. Shackles, good to me, i sings, are my favorite songs. I eagerly anticipate their next effort."
5,Be Blessed,"I bought Mary Mary because a good friend told me that the album was fantastic. Since i was expanding my collection...i went ahead and bought it. I couldn't be happier! Every single song is a TRUE BLESSING! There isn't a single song that I can say I don't like...they are all my favorites. I use Mary Mary as a ""tool"" for ministering to those that don't know Him. They hear me cranking Mary Mary and say how much they like it...before finding out it's Christian. They're shocked when they find out, but become interested. God Bless Mary Mary!!! (for they have definately blessed me and many others through their music ministry!!!!)"
5,Mary Mary Jams,"I love this record, every I mean every song is anointed. I just love it we play it over and over. Tina and Erica keep on doin' it, and congratulations on every award won or nominated. I recommed this album strongly for everyone"
4,Beautiful Song Birds,"It is so wonderful to see young, hip and gifted young women who are not afraid to wear the stylish trends of today and appeal to our youth, while giving God praise and glory. Mary Mary lets us know that not only can these girls blow, but they have style, class and a rythm all their own.The remake of ""What A Friend"" takes you back to sunday monin' service with a jazzy flair. No doubt we will hear more from these women for a long time to come.Peace and blessings!"
5,MARY MARY ROCKS,I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS ALBUM AFTER HEARING A SINGLE OF THEIRS ON THE RADIO AND I MUST SAY I AM IMPRESSED. THEIR MUSIC HAS A NEW APPROACH TO CHRISTIAN MUSIC THAT I HADN'T HEARD. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO LOTS OF PEOPLE. MY FAVORITE SONG IS SHACKLES.
5,Believe the Hype,"Before I purchased this CD, I questioned as to its overall quality. I heard ""Shackles"" and ""I Sings"" on the radio.They were tight and right. I figured they played only the best songs so you would buy the CD. Other friends of mine, however, accented what the world was already saying. After giving in to the ""pressure"", I went out and bought the CD. My vague appreciation for these new artist grew to a love and admiration of their talent. This album has hit all the right spots in my spiritual walk. It took me in the past with ""Wade in th Water"" and ""I can't Give Up Now"", reminding me where I came from. I help me in my present with ""I Sings"", reminding me I have so much to be thankful for. And it took me to the future with ""Still my Child"". Reminding me I will see the father some day because I am His. Please believe the hype. This CD is worth it!"
5,Mary Mary is BLAZIN!,"If you are looking for anointed music that you can sitll get your groove on with MARY MARY are it! I dont have the album yet but I heard full length clips of four songs, saw the ""Shackles"" video on BET, and bought the single and the album is HOT! Especially ""Good To Me"" feat. Destiny's Child, ""Shackles..."", ""Still My Child"", ""Be Happy"", ""Wade In The Water"", ""What A Friend"" and ""I Sings"" feat. B.B. Jay. THE ALBUM IS HOTT!"
3,"Mary-Mary and their album, Thankful.",This is a very strong album relating to the world around them and their religion. They sing many songs which you can dance along to and have a lot of fun. It is a mixture of Pop and soul music which gives it a good beat throughout all the songs. My personal favourite is Shackles as you can sing along to it and it has an very good rhythm.Hope you enjoy this album as much as I have to!!!
5,Linda Opinion,"I love Mary, Mary their music is great and God caring. I thank God for them and their music."
4,Shackling,"A very good scriptural gospel album. Stunning album which catches instantly you and stays in you CD loader for a long time. My best pick are the ""shackles"" and ""I Sings"". I noted that there are traces of too much ad libbing on some songs. Its a pity they used the same producer on all songs making some songs sound similar. All in all arguably the best gospel album of the year. Its a must have CD though will definitely not linger as a classic."
4,Thank you Mary Mary,This is a good C.D so buy it. I'm from Ft.Pierce Fl. The realist state. My email address is kre@.com so holla at a girl.
5,One for your collection!!!,"I have had this CD since it first came out and it remains a favorite. The songs are inspiring and their first track, ""Thankful,"" says it all.Get this CD!!!"
1,Mary Mary NOT YESTERDAY,"I searched the website for Mary Mary song called Yesterday and this is what I got. Being new to ordering CD's online I did not see where I could check to make sure the song was on this CD and I did not feel A need to since I searched for the song that I wanted for my birthday. Well I got Thankful which is A CD that I got from my daughter when it came out years ago. I must say the CD arrived quickly and in good shape and when I contacted the seller they where very short spoken with me, I won't order from them ever again"
5,Too Bad this was their last one...,"This EP was released after their amazing ""Storm of the Light's Bane"" longplayer. Featuring a cover of the song ""Elizabeth Bathori"" and of Slayer's ""Antichrist"" it is rounded out by two versions of the title track, and unreleased song from the ""Storm..."" sessions and a different version of their amazing classically-influenced piece, ""Feathers Fell.""So sad that the bad has not continued since the incarceration of mainman Jon Nodtveidt, they were showing such amazing progression."
5,The best is yet to come!,"I have all of the cds by PoG and they have yet to make a cd that I don't love. This cd is not quite as great as ""Steady On"" and ""The Whole Truth,"" but it is very close. There is not one bad song, and this cd is well worth buying even if you have never heard them or even if you have all of their cds."
2,NOT their best,"After receiving and loving their Steady On CD, I was looking forward to this one, especially after reading the reviews, but was somewhat dissappointed. Most of the songs have that overly-produced sound, that miss the heart and beauty that is evident on Steady On. Maybe this sound is a favorite of teenagers, which I am not. Many of the lyrics are common, uninspriring and overdone by other artists. They're great singers though, so I'll give their next CD a try (that is after I listen to it first at a music store)."
1,great music terrible disk,"I bought a copy of this from a store and i put it in my player and it wouldnt work. I returned it and some how i got my money back, but then i bought another copy at a different store (walmart) and that did not work and i exchanged it for a different copy and that copy is even worst!!! Now i can keep trying to return this cd back to walmart and take their crap each time or can someone please help find out WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS CD, BMG IM DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE CD!!!"
2,Won't work in my CD player,"I bought this CD in November '03. I played it immediately in my computer's CD drive. It worked fine. Then the next day I put it in my car's cd player and it wouldn't work. I figured I inadvertently scratched it. So, I ordered a second CD just last week and this one is doing the same exact thing!!! It worked fine in my computer this morning. So, I brought it along with me in the car to listen on my way into work. I tried other cd's in my car and they work just fine. Not sure why this one won't work in my car, and I don't know who to contact about it."
3,"Good, But There's Something Better","I only bought this CD because I wanted to get Kentucky Rain. It's an awesome song. There are some other great songs on here too, like Moody Blue and American Trilogy. This CD just can't compare with the 30 #1 Hits CD though. Be sure to get the 30 #1 Hits CD FIRST, and if you still want more Elvis after that, get this one.I definitely don't regret buying this CD, but the 30 #1 Hits CD is much, much better. Be sure to get that one for sure. That CD has Return to Sender on it, this one doesn't."
5,Elvis 2ND TO NONE- Great Music.,"It's too bad people are still milking Elvis and others like him many years later, But Elvis was/is one of the best, I am not a Huge Fan, not even a Big Fan. I like some of his songs. Trouble is my Favorite song. and ""your always on my Mind"" Believe it or not I am 27 and Glenn Danzig's Music Got me into it, Has A Couple good tracks and 1 Unreleased . and it's not expensive, Recommend to anyone even the Casual fan. R.I.P. Elvis."
4,good compilation,"My parents remember where they were when they heard the news that Elvis was dead, actually I don't think I was even born yet. I've never owned an Elvis album but I've always been familiar with several of his songs just because of his impact on american rock music. This cd is great because it has reminded me of those songs that I knew I liked but couldn't place, couldn't remember the title, or whatever. His voice sounds great on the album and the songs move from some of his earliest recordings, very R&B to 70's Elvis, replete with horns and the like. The bottom line is this: buy the album, if you are a rock and roll fan you won't be dissapointed. I've been converted. This was my first Elvis album and now I own several."
5,Peter is wrong,"Peter Leheby asserts that the Elvis remix did not chart in the UK. In fact, A Little Less Conversation was number one for five weeks beating out the Beatles record of 17 number one hits by having his 18th.Before writing reviews (especially nasty ones) get your facts straight."
1,BMG sells Faulty CD!,"I got to hear more songs on the web than I did on the E2 CD that I purchased! The CD immediately went to track 13, played a minute, then stopped. Could never get any of the other 29 tracks to play anything! (And my CD player works just fine!) All the press about people getting sued over downloading music from the web and BMG sends CDs to the stores for people to pay too much money for what? NOTHING! I'm furious and stores do not willing take back opened CDs!!! Music industry listen up---if the quality of your CDs are poor, you have no grounds to sue!"
3,THIS CD WILL NOT WORK ON A LAPTOP CD DRIVE,"I'm returning mine because it is defective. Intentional or not, I'm tired of The Man purposely defecting cd's so that they cannot be played on a computer! This is deceptive and illegal sales practice!!Other than than, I can only say that this cd must rock given the content."
1,Copyright protected.,I eagerly put this CD in my computer and the darn thing doesn't play. DON'T buy it. I believe it's part of BMG's new copyright protection scheme. It plays on my kareoke machine. I'm taking this one back. The he!! with BMG.
2,Elvis - 2nd to none CD = BAD,"I ordered ""Elvis - 30 #1 Hits"" and this CD was fine.Along with that order, I ordered ""Elvis 2nd to None"".The CD case was damaged, and the actual CD contained songs in it that were damaged...Unfortunately it was a gift that I gave someone in another state, which makes it too complicated to return..."
4,Elvis Lives!,"I got this album and hearing ""Always on My Mind"" and ""American Trilogy"" alone made it worth owning! A few songs are a little hokey -- ""Roustabout,"" ""Rock A' Hula"" among them -- but most are simply fabulous. I heard a couple Elvis tunes from the '70s I'd never heard before and they were truly ahead of their time. The ""Rubberneckin'"" remix is really catchy too. I was four months old when Elvis died, so I never got to see him in concert. Yet, for some reason, I've always missed him. ELVIS IS THE KING!"
4,Word of Advice,"Memo to all the would-be critics who feel the need to complain because every new Elvis release is basically a repackage of previously issued recordings...the guy has been dead for almost 27 years - I think by now all of us realize there won't be anymore ""new"" material! Besides, what differnce does it make? You act as if the only peolpe buying Elvis CDs are those who have been collecting for the last 30 years. These new releases like, ""Elvis: 2D to None"", are great for those (like my eight yera old son) who are just discovering Elvis for the first time. To the novice listener, all of these songs are ""new"" and better yet, remastered and far better sounding than earlier packages."
4,A great hits package,"Elvis Presley came out with Elvi's 30 #1 hits. It contained the best songs of his career.This is the sequal to it. This contains the great songs that were not quite good enought to be included but are memorable in their own right.The span of this CD goes from That's Al Right to Blue Suede Shoes and Little Sister.It also includes hits that were later in his career such as Trouble, If I Can Dream, Memories, Always on my Mind and my personal favorite on this CD, American Trilogy which is a Medley of Dixie Land, The Battle Hymn of the Republic and All my Trials.This is a great album and a must for any Elvis fans"
5,The Way Elvis's Music Was Meant To Sound:,"I'm a 21 year old college student in Los Angeles and love Elvis. This new cd with remastered sound is outstanding. Even after hearing the same songs many times before, when you hear Second To None, it's like hearing the songs for the first time. The songs have much more power with every sound emphasized for your maximum enjoyment. I would like BMG to release this cd on dvd-audio as they did with Elvis 30# hits. Even for the casual Elvis fans, I recommend you buy this cd because of how influential this artist was. You won't regret it!"
1,Stupid Copy Protection,"I bought this disk, loving the first one, and it doesnt play in my computer. see other 1 stars for more information on this problem. DONT BUY AT ANY COST."
5,Essential Elvis,"Where does this ""Elvis hated black people"" crap come from?!? Did he announce it in a press conference I must have missed???Some of Elvis's greatest influences & most beloved artists were black.If you don't like Elvis to begin with--&/or haven't even listened to the recording...why waste your time (& mine) commenting?"
5,"ONE FOR THE MONEY, TWO FOR THE SHOW...","First off, I'd like to say I much prefer the Canadian cover to this second compilation of Elvis recordings. Secondly, though the first was great, this one gives us a little more variety and does a fantastic job of it too--congrats to Vic Anesini for correcting the sound on ""I Want You, I Need You, I Love You"" and to Peter Guralnick (?) for adding the periodic ""1st to""s in bigger type! ""Roustabout"" and ""Rubbernickin'"" as well as the latter's remix are a great adddition. Now, when do we get ""Three to get ready and go, go, go...""? Maybe a compilation of only remixes?"
4,Enjoyable.....................,"After reading the last couple of books in this series and not enjoying them I decided to give Brenda one more chance. Deadly Kisses was a real good treat for me. This book finally put it all together. Calder is framed for murder and Fran will have to risk everything to save him. Leigh Ann and Rick Bragg have everything on the line to protect their future daughters from harm and finally Evan,Fran's brother throws the Bartello woman out on her butte and dumps her flat. Very enjoyable read and highly recommended read if you have been caught in this series. Now the only problem is waiting for the next book in this series. Now I want Calder and Fran to be together."
1,Warning to fans of this series...,"I am a fan of the Francesca series and love the first 6 books. I am sorry to say I will not be picking up another after this read. Here's why, Francesca is no longer believable. Yes, I know this is romantic fiction, but I found my limits of 'suspension of disbelief' completely overtested with this one. Francesca is a noble character, but her nobility regarding Calder's secret was too much. Secondly, I have a bit of a problem with continuity...Calder explains something about the romantic nature of his relationship with Daisy that is completely contradicted in 'Deadly Affairs' I know this is picky, but the author seems to be trying to rewrite her character's history. It just seems like with the switch in publisher's the bar was lowered in terms of story and character development. Frankly, it's boring. I am so sad that a series that I loved, is now something I will be passing by on the shelf."
5,"A great ""everything you need to know"" book!","I am a novice when it comes to making and using herbs and essential oils. This book tells me all I need to know to begin. A great book in my opinion not only for the beginner, but even for those who wish to know more. It is not just about recipes, rather it is about how to make salves, astringents, select the herbs and so much more. I ordered and received a few more books on herbs and this is by far the best. In fact, you really do not need another book if your purchased this one."
2,Colors are not good,I bought this to be the topper for a baby shower cake. The dark brown/black areas were a reddish brown. Pooh's shirt was not a good Pooh red color. I had to use markers to fix the topper. Pooh's eyes looked evil due to the color issue. I hope once it is on the decorated cake it will look better.
5,Five stars ... plus.,"Jack and Toby: Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in ye merrie olde England. Great! When you've finished this, go on to the follow-up Aubrey/Maturin series, without a doubt the best written seafaring tales in all of literature. Mr. O'Brian died in January at age 85, leaving behind a legacy unmatched by few contemporary writers in the English language."
5,If you like the Master and Commador series you will not be disappointed,I've now read everything Patrick O'brain's written and this was not a disappointment at all. Excellent book.
5,Simply excellent,"The first time I ran into this book was at the public library, while serching reference material for my daughter's science project. I found the book so helpful that I checked it out again for my own use. The third time I said: ""I have to have my own copy."" The 13th edition is now on its way."
5,Excellent,It has been very hard for me to find just the right books for my kindergartner to read. I wanted to find some books with a plot but not to many overwhelming words. This entire series of books has been JUST what I have been looking for. They are not to simple but they do have a story line to them. They come with star stickers and he enjoys reading them becausue every time you read the story you can put a star on the inside front cover. He wants to fill up the inside cover with stars!! The reward stickers are a great idea and have definately encouraged him to read and then read again.
4,"Good, If Somewhat Sanitized","This lucid little book draws on the Pali canon to retell the life of the Buddha and to recast his philosophy as a strategy for moral and psychological transformation. It succeeds in making Buddhism palatable to modern Western readers at the cost of playing down religious doctrines such as karma and rebirth. Given these omissions, I'm not sure whether it is faithful to the teachings of the historical Buddha or to Buddhism as practiced by the vast majority of Buddhists in Asia. However, I would strongly recommend the book to anyone who is curious about Buddhism but who would be put off by a ""religious"" book."
3,Cute,Kinda cheaply made like costume material but cute. You will need a garter to hold them up cuz they will not stay up on their own...It was true to my size. I am 57 1/2 and 225lbs. They fit well for me.
1,spilled ink,These might be okay if you pick them up at the manufacturer or like having ink all over you when you open it.
4,Received just fine,"I ordered two sets in black and brown and they arrived just fine. Shipping was a bit high, but they are heavy. I am not sure if the final price per piece saved me money over getting them at Lowes or Home Depot."
1,Title very misleading!,"The title of Truman and Pendergast implys that there is some meaningful and new knowledge regarding the relationship between these two men. This is simply not the case. There is very little about that relationship but rather a rehash of frequently publish information in other bios. This book, while it may be well written, adds nothing to the pile of information already out there. Three-percent of this very short book explored the relationship and ninety-seven percent was about the difficulties experienced by Truman because of the stigma of the relationship. Nothing new. If you want to read some great bios on Truman read TRUMAN by McCullough or MAN OF THE PEOPLE by Hamby."
3,Decent pot-boiler,"Sax Rohmer created the famous Fu Manchu series. His breathless purple prose about the Yellow Peril tapped into the fear, prejudices, and stereotypes of his era, so that very little else was really needed to create an exciting story. And, since each book, was one in a series, crisp endings didn't matter all that much. Each story was expected to pave the way for the next.So, if you strip off the racial stereotypes and prejudices, there wasn't really much left to distinguish the story. That becomes apparent in this book. It recycles the evil super-scientist bent on world domination (destruction in this case), the sweet young thing dragged, against her will, into the plot, and dashing good guys who save the world with just moments to spare. You know, the usual.If shallow characters, unexplained situations, and abrupt endings suit your idea of a story, have a blast. This is pulp fiction at its pulpiest, with all the good and bad that implies.- wiredweird"
1,Thighs of Steel 2000,"I was very disappointed with this video. After the first 10 minutes, I wanted a refund. This one by far must be Tamilee Webb's worst. I was accustomed to her earlier videos where she was the only instructor in the video and there was very little aerobics. This tape has 2 instructors in addition to Tamilee Webb and places too much emphasis on aerobics. If you enjoy aerobics, this tape is for you. If you prefer toning without aerobics, this video is not for you."
5,NewMomInDC,"I absolutely love this tape. The aerobic segment is fantastic. It took a couple of days to get the arms and steps correctly. I loved the fact that the steps were broken down and easy to follow. The instructors, Tamilee, Donna Richardson and Traci York are encouraging and enthusiastic.I highly recommend it if you enjoy aerobics."
3,Thighs Of Steel,"I have several exercise videos and use them in rotation - the content of this one is good but the sound is awful - the music is so intrusive that I have trouble hearing the instructor; if I turn the sound up, the music gets louder and I still can't hear her. Can't say my thighs have improved dramatically, but that's probably my fault!"
4,GREAT,"Ive always loved The Original Simcity,and Simcity 2000. Simcity 3000 Unlimited is based on Simcity 2000's concept but with new (better looking) buildings,a few new disasters,and some new layers of simluation such as garbage,city trade,petitioners, and all that stuff. Great game thou!"
2,Sim DISASTER,"This game was a real surprise to me...NOT. This game really stunk in my point of view. The graphics are blocky, and tornados rip through almost eery 2.5 seconds. Think about it this way, you build a magnificent, huge, great, titanic, supreme metropolis, only to have 6600 natural disasters to rip through in a week leaving your town in shambles. This game is a real disgrace to the PC. The modes are similar to each other so that, you can say the whole game copied itself 10 times over! the only interesting part of this nasty object is that the objects that you can create outrageous buildings and spaceships. All, in All, this game should be buried for life!"
2,Please...,"This dvd is very tame compared to other items available out there. I'm sure you've heard it on the news. Japanese women complaining to police that they are being groped on trains and molested in public. The link below is absolutely overflowing with such dvds. There are groping dvds, dvds of women's skirt being blown up by the wind from nature and trains. Women's skirts being pulled up in public and panties pulled down to their knees, dvds of women's tops being pulled down in crowded cities by what they call ""fiends"" exposing their breasts and so much more. [...]"
1,Cheap plastic,"This looked like cheap plastic--very yellow. Not the luster of marble, but a shiny cheap material.This didn't have the high end look I desired, so returned it ASAP."
5,These guys should be up there with phish,"Ive seen a few of there shows and they are un beileveable, there really talented and they have ervetything from latin rythem to hard out funk, defeinrtly buy the cd you wont be disapointed"
2,When is U2 going to learn ?,"Yet again U2 has managed to force feed us 2 more ""club"" versions of an otherwise excellent song. ""Beautiful Day"" is a long awaited old style U2 rocker that has plenty of potential if remixed properly. On these cuts, all but 1 guitar riff and Bono's vocals are stripped from the song making the remixes sound terribly forced, not to mention poorly paced.On the other hand, ""Big Girls Are Best"" is an EXCELLENT outtake from the ""Pop"" sessions and a must have for any U2 fanatic.Thumbs up on the cover photo as well, these guys still look great after all those years !!!"
2,OK for fans of 'Pop' and dance mixes,"This single features the same version of ""Stuck in a Moment"" as the record, 'All That You Can't Leave Behind.' So why buy it? ""Big Girls Are Best"" is an outtake from the 'Pop' sessions, much in the same vein as the other b-sides from that record (like ""Holy Joe"" and ""Happiness is a Warm Gun""). The remixes of ""Beautiful Day"" are interesting if you are into dance remixes (and if that is the case, check out the Perfecto Mix single of ""Even Better Than the Real Thing""). Otherwise, pass this one by."
5,SMILE: I Can't Put It Down,Big Star meets Pink Floyd at a country music symposium held at Abbey Road studios #2.I'm floored....the song Smile would be a #1 smash in a just universe.
4,On the path but not quite their,"After Sound of Lies the Jayhawks led one to believe that Smile would be their claim to fame work. That it isn't. Instead we have a solid rock effort that Ezrin may have decided to START producing again with but may have forgotten many of the tools of his trade along the way. With atomos-phere that has been missing from a Jayhawk lp, Ezrin has done at least one thing right. This does have that down-home feel of a Jayhawk record that I feel has been missing since Hollywood TH and haven't heard in all it's complete beauty on a record since last years Minster Hill record. The real problem here is the songs don't pop up at you. This release reminds me alot of the new Ween record in that there are songs struggling to get out but just can't. The next record will be their biggie."
3,Drum machines? Where's Karen?,"If they would have just left out ""Somewhere in Ohio"" and ""Wildest Dreams"", I'd give this CD 4 stars. But since they are the two songs co-written by Alice Cooper's producer, I guess they had to be included. Why Bob Ezrin? Tchad Blake, Mitch Froom, maybe Daniel Lanois might have achieved the atmosphere without letting it out of the studio with #'s 4 and 11. Eleven strong songs, beautifully written and played ( but with drum machines? what's with that?) would have been great. Yeah, I know I can skip them, but I feel they should have, IMO. Also, I'm sure Jen is wonderful, but did Karen not want to be photographed? I know she's left to be a mother full time, but it's her lovely voice and keyboards on the CD."
4,"Oh come on, admit it, you like it.....","Just a brief note about this CD and other Amazon reviews: it seems that the reviews split between those who are appalled that the Jayhawks have produced a professional, not so harsh, very listenable CD, and those (like myself) who are thrilled to see a great talent make an effort to be accessible yet stick to their musical ideals. This CD is an almost perfect mix of smooth ballads, cutting rock, and some really sharp lyrics. I can't imagine anyone not liking it, and I think I can read between the lines on the not-so-positive reviews that even they begrudgingly like it."
3,"Strong, but unremarkable","The Jayhawks are a Minnesota-based folk/rock band with a long history and a few lineup changes. The latest edition of the band has given us Smile, an uneven album with moments of pure pop exuberance in ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"" and ""Queen of the World"" to go along with a few out and out clunkers. The balance of the album is made up of strong, but unremarkable songs of styles ranging from grinding rock to folksy ballads. There is some good stuff here, but it just all doesn't come together into a memorable package."
4,"Smile , smile , smile.....",Well.....Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass it ain't but it sure put a smile on my face! For me Sound of Lies got stuck on the fence but Smile made it over...excellent! I just saw the band live (for the second time) at the Shepherds Bush Empire in London and it was a great gig. Some classics like Two Hearts....but a shameless plug of the new album so I bought it! If Smile succeeds in putting them in front of a wider audience (and earning them more money!)...who can then go back and buy their classics than it's a job well done. I also have a huge amount of respect for bands who can really 'do it' live. Good on ya Jayhawks!
5,"Timeless, incredible!","This is an incredible CD from one of my top five favorite bands of all time (and they are from my hometown of the best city ever, Minneapolis!). It is always near or in my CD player. I NEVER EVER tire of it. I dont really have the words to express how this CD makes me feel. If I could give it ten stars, I would. But then again, that is how I feel about pretty much everything the Jayhawks have done."
4,"Great Band - ""Smile"" another Trophy...","The Jayhawks will never ""hit it big"" - no matter how badly they deserve it...or how wonderful the songs are. Music conscious is just not on their side. Oh, well, another solid, outstanding effort. Every song's not great, but 3/5ths, perfect! Melodic, entertwining harmonies; loud, not abrasive; quiet/calm, but never sleepy. I'd love to think this band would push 20 albums out, but I'm afraid Louris will ditch after this, or at most, one more album. 15 years + - and your tribute will mostly be your faithful fans. Outstanding, boys (and girls)! You're my faves, my best memories, my everything music-wise. Thanks you, thank you!"
3,Certainly not their best,"I'm really trying to like this CD. It's not bad, there some good songs on it, but nothing that even approaches Hollywood Town Hall or Tomorrow the Green Grass. The harmonies are also a little strange, almost Fleetwood Mac-like. Gary Louris' guitar seems to be getting pushed further and further into the background on this album, too, which is a real downer. The band seems to have lost its soul. Too bad."
2,The Mismatch of the Century,"This CD makes me very sad. The Jayhawks were one of my favorite bands. Artists need to expand their horizons, yes, but this is the mismatch of the century. Bob Ezrin made great Alice Cooper records in the Seventies. Twenty years later, should he be redefining the Jayhawks? That's a matter of opinion, I guess. There are good songs on here, don't get me wrong. Some work pretty well. (Mr Wilson, Smile) Others are embarrassing. If they wanted to merge their style with a more modern approach, (drum samples, loops, etc) they would have done MUCH better with Mitchel Froom producing. This CD may grow on me. I wasn't impressed with Sound of Lies at first and grew to kind of like it. It's doubtful, though, that I will, since I have never grown to admire an album that made me cringe on first listening."
3,Big Disappointment,"I agree with Keith from Minnesota -- This record is a big disappointment, and Bob Ezrin should take most of the blame. He ruined what could have been a big improvement over Sound of Lies. His generic classic-rock, Jeff Lynn-like gloss almost completely obscures these songs' distinctiveness. Except for loud rockers like ""Life Floats By"" and ""Somewhere In Ohio,"" you'd be hard pressed to tell what song you were listening to if you were to set your CD player to ""shuffle.""SMILE is doubly disappointing because it follows the terrific Golden Smog's WEIRD TALES, which featured Jayhawks Gary Louris, Marc Perlman, and Kraig Johnson."
5,"Great CD, wonderful production","This CD brings together the excellent song writing with polished production. 'Sound of Lies' was the pre-cursor to this and they made a CD even better than that one.BTW, I like the more bare-boned sound of their earlier CDs however I think the followup, 'Rainy Days Music' is way off the mark.This is the best Jayhawks CD."
2,Overproduced,"First, I *LOVE* the Jayhawks. I have worn out the last 3 disks and Golden Smog's ""WEIRD TALES"". But if I wanted to listen to Air Supply or the Traveling Willburys, I would have bought their albums. This album is terribly overproduced.So while this is still better than almost all of the music out there, please don't let this be your first Jayhawks album. I'd recommend ""Tomorrow the Green Grass"".p.s. I was too harsh. At least a 3.5 star album."
2,Not as good as the earlier Jayhawks,"No no no... After buying ""Hollywood town hall"" and ""Tomorrow the green grass"" you might think that ""Smile"" will sound the same - well it doesn't. On this release there's only one great song in ""Somewhere in Ohio"", and there's a good one in ""I'm gonna make you love me"". The rest is just forgettable. Skip this one!"
3,Not quite big enough,"We bought this dish rack as it looked to be the same as one we had had for a number of years. I like the capability of folding it up and hiding it when we have company. I had high hopes for the rack. I like everything about it except the fact that I can't put our dishes in it . The rack is just a little too small. It works for everything else, but if we just are going to wash two dinner dishes and don't want to use the dishwasher, they have to put them sideways in the rack, not in the spaces designated for dishes. Not a good design for us."
2,dish drain,"Not the item I expected to receive. Seemed more plastic and smaller than I needed. I don't believe it was advertised incorrectely, it just wasn't the item I was looking for. The plastic base they suggested to purchase with the dish drain was way too small. I sent back the entire shipment."
1,Disappointed,"This is not what I had expected. It is not stainless and does not have lustre. I also had to use cable ties to secure it from falling flat when a cup or plate is placed on it. I just replaced one that I had over 10 years, only because it was black. Very disappointed but it's too late to return since i had dumped the older version. i would not reccommended this to anyone. Will continue to shop for a chrome version."
2,not working,"Hi, It will be returned for replacement as it was damaged goods. The rack will not stand up. My daughter-in-law who received it for Christmas will be returning it for replacement. Thank you, Anne Harding"
4,"If you liked the first two in the series, you will like this book!","I bought this book through Amazon for my 14 year old son - he loved the first two books in the series and is enjoying ""The Night Mask""."
5,Trucco Pro Lip Pencils are the Best I Have Ever Used,"Hello magical Trucco Pro Lip pencils, the best I've ever used. Quality. You stay almost all day. You do not create furrows. You travel well.You've been used by motion picture studio make-up artists for a reason.How sad I am the company that manufactures you is no longer in business. I have yet to find a product that can equal you. Missing you."
4,Nice shoes!,"I ordered the same size as the other shoes I order from Kenneth Cole but this shoes is kinda tight on the side. I should have ordered a size bigger. Oh well, that's the problem from ordering online."
3,David Beckham Unauthorized Bio,"The DVD provided some insights into Beckham's history and personality I wasn't aware of - almost exclusively from sports writers and others' accounts (as this is an 'unauthorized' biography. Not a lot of video of Beckham in action and/or being interviewed. For real David Beckham fans, there's probably better DVDs out there."
2,Beckham from a tabloid perspective,"This DVD is mildly entertaining, but it relies much too heavily on the accounts of journalists and pundits, rather than anyone close to David Beckham. It glosses over his youth experiences to focus on Beckham's celebrity status and has very little on-field football footage. Most of the football stories are relayed via photos; you can find more dynamic material on YouTube for free.Considered that Beckham is still writing great new chapters to his own story with the Galaxy and his resurrection in Capello's England squad, we'll hopefully see a better retrospective on his career sometime in the future. This one is worth skipping."
5,Fascinating Story!,"Wray Miller has written a vivid, fascinating story. Compelling and dimensional characters with an intriguing plot."
3,"This Movie's Age Shows, Strictly for Nostalgia","An OK movie, didn't really take the plot too seriously, just wanted to look at the animated Chipmunks for the first time in years after seeing the 2007 live-action movie.As expected, looks like an early 90's kid's movie, but the songs weren't bad and it's pretty fun. Make you remember the time."
1,Alvin,I have not yet received the item althought it has been over a month since I placed the order- Still waiting................ Might change my review score once I receive it but it is an Easter gift so hopefully it will be here forthwith.
3,Not my favorite Chipmunk DVD,"I got this DVD for my four children. Alvin is deceptive in more ways than usual in this movie and some of the themes are more adult oriented than I would like. I was not overly impressed with the animation. I never saw this in the original format and would have no desire to after this viewing. There is nothing inherently wrong with this DVD, just not one of the finer Chipmunk shows."
2,multiple places were DVD skipped,"Love the movie, however it was unfortunate that the DVD sipped in several places... I am really bummed out because I paid a lot of money for this disk because it is no longer in print and got something that did not work well."
4,The Chipmunk Adventure,"I bought this for my two grandsons who are 3 and 4. The 3 yr old loved it, he watched it over and over. The 4 yr old is not really into the Chipmunks so he did not watch the entire movie."
4,Around the world - Chipmunk style,"On a bet the Chipmunks(the boys) and Chipettes(the girls) engage in a race around the world. The prize is put up by a brother and sister. Who make a condition of the race that the teams have to stop at various locals and drop off and pick up any object. Sounds fishy and it is.At the various stops there are adventures and a song. The family favorite is in Athens where the Chipmunks and the Chippette sing a dueling song of ""The Boys/Girls of Rock 'n Roll"". All the songs are good.The other characters are interesting. The bad guys, the brother and sister, are the usual snotty, sarcastic type. But they are funny. I love the babysitter. I can't hear someone says, ""is (fill in name) available and not think ""available for what?""It is a fun and enjoyable movie."
5,Better than now,"The old chipmunks are way better than the new ones, this is a classic for all kids to watch."
4,Fun video,"I bought this because my daughter remembered liking it when she was a kid. It's a pretty fun movie to watch with catchy songs, but I didn't remember the ""Get Lucky"" song, and probably kids won't notice it anymore than they originally did."
5,My first favorite movie,"I remember actually seeing this movie in the theaters, and becoming quickly obsessed with it. When it finally came out on video, I watched it with my best friend at least five times a week. We even acted out scenes from it which, to this day, continue to provide entertainment to our friends. Sometime around age 15, I lost the tape, and didn't notice it, until one day, I had an urge to see it. I rented it, and remembered why it was so wonderful--the songs, the adventure! This is a video that every family should have! The images and sights always made me want to travel, and that feeling is still within me. So even now, at age 20, I still have to pop in the Chipmuck Adventure, and watch it, having every line memorized. But for me, it's like the first time all over again."
5,What An Adventure!!,"Very entertaining from start to finish, simply the best from the original chipmunks!!An adventure you'll never forget, highly recommended. A must for chipmunk fans."
5,Great classic WAY cheaper at Walmart!!!,I always buy all of my classic cartoons for my son off of Amazon but what's with the insane $56 pice tag on this? Walmart.com has it for $10.86 - considerably less!!!
4,Chipmunk Adventure,I found the movie at Walmart cheaper than I paid on here after I bought it. It took longer to come that I expected as well.
5,Well Done!,"The item was sent in a timely fashion, received in the exact condition that it was represented to be in (slightly better, even). This seller is reliable!"
5,80' Classic,"This is truly a good find. The animation has great style and crisp scenes. The sound quality is great also, with optional surround sound, and stereo. It does not sound stifled or old.The songs are great, and the story is adorable. I recommend this movie completely."
5,Great Fun!!!,I love The chipmunks and their movie... It is a great send up of Arround The World in 80 days. The scene with the penguin was so touchiing. The Animation was splended as well as the music. I hope that a new film with the Chipmunks comes soon!
4,"Fun music, interesting plot for a cartoon and very funny.","I loved this movie as a child. The music is upbeat, the characters are very funny and the plot is acctually sophisticated for a cartoon. The idea of traveling around the world in a hot air balloon is sure to ignite the imaginations of children who see this movie."
1,Are you adusting for inflation?,"Who pays $11,000 for a silly cartoon? Great way to get people to look at it. Nice Joke."
2,Not great for kids,"I wish I wouldn't have bought this movie. I thought it wasn't the greatest for my kids. For example, the man smoking all the time in it, my kids wanting to do rock n' roll head bangs after watching it, and them learning to say ""Shut-up"" because in the movie it always says, ""Alvin . . . shut-up."" Also, the art and graphics in it is terrible, which I don't mind too much as long as it is a good movie for my kids, but it wasn't."
5,"A true Chipmunk classic, what an adventure!!","A very entertaining movie from start to finish, simply the best chipmunk movie to date. A true chipmunk classic, what an adventure. A must for chipmunk fans!!"
4,Houston We Have Audio/A Must Movie,"Thanks MP. I changed my audio to English Stero under the DVD Setup screen and I have backgroud audio and sound effects. I was also disappointed with the special features. I thought they would have music videos, making of the movie, deleted scenes or something. That is why I am leaving my rating at four stars.However, I still love it, love it, love it. I remember seeing this movie for the first time while visiting my cousins in New England in the 80's. Loved it then, love it now. I even brought my niece a copy. I have a copy on VHS from when I tape it off the Disney Channel, before they started showing commericals. Need to say it is a bit worn; therefore, I was excited when it was being released on DVD.I recommend buying this movie and bring out your inner child. If you have children, share this movie with them and let them see what real cartoons were like."
5,My son loves this movie!,When I was a child I loved this Chipmunk movie and bought it for my son who loves the newer Chipmunk movie. After watching the movie this became my son's favorite Chipmunk movie. He loves the songs just as I did as a kid. I also think it's cool how they added a CD of the songs in the movie. Classic movie that all Alvin and The Chipmunk fans should have.
5,GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!,This movie has been my favorite since I was like 4 or 5 years old and I just turned 21. it is most definitely shelf-worthy.seriously buy this movie no matter your age
5,"brand new, fast delivery, a classic","I've loved this movie since I was a little kid and I got it for my four younger siblings and they love it too. It's cute, funny, and not corny like most children's movies. The delivery was quick, the condition was perfect, the price was great. Brought back memories... :)"
5,The best Chipmunk movie for the whole family,This was one of the best Chipmunk movies that I have ever seen. It is a great movie for the family. I am a big Alvin and the Chipmunks fan. I showed this to my nephew and he loved it. The songs are great. It will make you laugh and cry and if you grew up with the chipmunks like I did it will make you relive your childhood all over again. I cannot wait until the actual cartoon series is released on dvd. I will definitley add that to my chipmunk dvd collection. This movie is a must see!
3,GOOD VALUE,"I needed a good quality cable to connect my pre-amp to my eq and back, and i did not want to spend a ton of money. these monster cables are much better than many generic ones. better bass, somewhat quieter and smoother overall sound."
4,Entertaining.,"Although it was certainly not Oscar-class, it was Clint Eastwood as we expected to see him as a bad-ass cop. Hundreds of cops shooting thousands of rounds into a bus inching its way to the cop shop?It arrived on time and in advertized condition."
3,The Gauntlet,"If you like loud, and unbelievable, this is the one to see. Special effects are quite interesting, but the whole scenario of the climax to movie is not really realistic - perhaps the entire premise of the film is unrealistic."
2,Horribly Unrealistic,"I will admit, this movie is not lacking in action in any way. However, it's incredibly unrealistic and has a poor story line. For an Eastwood movie, this one just isn't holding its own."
1,Never want to see it again,"I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters way back. This movie always comes to mind whenever I think of the worst movies ever made. The worst scene is when he welds some 1/4"" steel plate around the driver's seat of a bus and drives through a gauntlet of cops shooting at him from roofs. He miraculously makes it through, walks up some stairs and decks a guy. Pretty silly."
1,One of the 10 worst movies of all time IT REALLY STINKS,"This movie stunk, stinks, and is just plain BAD. It truley is not worth the time it takes to write this review, but hopefully I can save some others from a bad plot, bad acting (Sandra Locke really stinks the place up), and situations that would not happen (a crazed woman with a gun in the middle of a couple of hundred police officers and non of them are 1. running for cover or tring to dodge a bullet and 2. trying to stop her or take the gun away). DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY WITH THIS MOVIE IN ANY WAY."
1,Eastwood Bomb,"EASTWOOD BOMBIts hard to imagine Clint Eastwood creating a bad movie, but hey...this was his directing debut. Give the man a break -- punk. The movie has Eastwood as a down and out cop who is easy prey for all the bad cops looking to take him down. Sondra Locke turns in a sucky job as a prostitute seeking witless protection under Eastwood's care. The only good thing about the movie is seeing Class-A Eastwoodian actor Pat Hingle as the only friend this cop has. Warning: This movie is only for die hard Eastwoodians."
4,"Pure, Eastwood Entertainment!","Unlike some of the other reviewers who seem to enjoy spending their time tearing a movie apart for its accuracy rather than for what it is... Pure entertainment! Who cares if no cop wants to grab the gun from a ""crazy"" woman, it's the humorous fact that they're letting her get away with it. Just remember, He's got the gun, the badge, and the love of Jesus in his pretty green eyes. What more could a viewer want?"
4,Great Looking Remaster on Blu-Ray,"This catalog remaster is superb! Looks like it came out recently, not 30 years ago. No frills or extras, but kudos to Warner Bros for keeping the price low. The movie gets 3 stars, the disc gets 4 as there are no extras.Warner Bros - give us The Outlaw Josie Wales and North by Northwest on Blu-ray - soon!"
4,Clint's best non-Dirty Harry Actioner,"Clint stars and directs this action-packed tale about an out-of-it cop who goes an a ""routine"" mission to get a witness (ex-girlfrind Sandra Locke) to Phoenix. The problem is that nobody wants them back alive, leading to attacks on them the entire way. the highlights include shooting up both a hideout house and the bus when they finally get to Phoenix. Best quote: after Sandra Locke whines over injured Clint, who she thinks is dead, he says ""Nag, nag."""
1,"Great movie, LOUSY LOUSY transfer","This is one of Clint's best, but the transfer is awful. All dark scenes are grainy, highly pixellated. The daylight scenes (fortunately the balance of the movie) are OK. Movie 3 stars, transfer 1 star."
2,okay for an action movie,"Plenty of suspense, running, shooting, dodging, and betrayal. This movie is really not realistic in some parts, like when a bus gets shot up about 1,000 times and none of the bullets hits the fuel tank. Nor can I say the movie has much depth and the plot is relatively predictable. The only good part about it is portrayal of police corruption, although this is certainly not the only movie to do so, and a strong female character, which is usually terribly lacking in these types of films. Considering it was made in the 1970s, maybe some of the cliche scenes can be forgiven."
4,"a ""nothing witness"" for a ""nothing trial""","If you like Dirty Harry you should like this show. Lots of good one-liners, an Eastwood movie staple. Eastwood calls Blakelock after escaping two near death experiences and says, ""Someone doesn't want your nothing witness to testify at your nothing trial"". It's amazing how the bus they're in gets riddled with thousands of rounds of ammo but they never bother to shoot out the tires. But who needs realism in an Eastwood movie? The show is as much a comedy as action adventure. Realistic it isn't but entertaining it is."
4,Another fine Clint Eastwood cop flick,"""The Gauntlet"" is yet another fine Clint Eastwood cop flick. In this one Eastwood is a down and out police officer, out of favor with his superiors. He is detailed to escort a prisoner back to Arizona to testify (Sandra Locke). Naturally, there is more to it and a conspiracy brewing, and more would be telling. The main focus of the film is the interaction between Eastwood and Locke, and the chemistry is very successful. In fact Locke is perhaps the best female lead I have seen in any Eastwood flick--she is perfect for this role and kind of runs away with this movie.While I'm not sure I buy the ending, this film is great fun that every Clint Eastwood fan will enjoy. Recommended. RJB."
4,"run this ""gauntlet""","when i was growing up i used to think this was part of the ""dirty harry"" films, which it isn't. this takes place in phoenix as clint is a down and out drunk cop sent on a low grade job to bring a person in to tell all that they know to a grand jury. what he doesn't know is that his boss is in the middle of this and want him to fail.this isn't the best film clint has stared in or directed but you can see his control over the product becomeing more and more sure. it's silly a little long and i still say watch this little action/thriller and have a good time."
2,"eastwood great as always, everything else.....eh","Being a big Eastwood fan, I bought this unseen and watched it for the first time last night. Eastwood is great, as always, although his cop character in this one displays a little more vulnerability than most of his tough guy roles. Locke's acting is over-the-top and annoying, as always. This is a pretty good action movie, but the ending is ridiculous. After blasting the hell out of this bus, the cops are just going to let Eastwood walk up the steps of city hall with a gun tucked into his waistband? I mean, no one says a word to him. And on top of that, he takes the assistant d.a. hostage and Locke's character shoots the police commissioner dead in front of the entire Phoenix police department, and nobody does a damn thing? Are you kidding? I'm all for suspending a sense of reality when watching action movies, but give me a break. This ain't no academy-award winner. Eastwood is the only thing saving this turkey."
4,Why not Harry?,"This is a good action movie for it's day, but why didn't they make the lead character Dirty Harry? This was a mirror to the Dirty Harry movies, wonder why they didn't make it under that name. Living in Vegas I recognized a lot of the desert where they filmed some of the chase scenes. Good movie for a Saturday night before you go out."
2,Not as expected,"I've used Rubbermaid brand grip liner and it's definitely got more grip. This does provide some cushioning for glassware but I purchased it in order to stop utensil holders from moving each time a drawer is opened. This brand doesn't do that. The holder slides and the liner itself slides pretty freely where on the drawer side, too."
5,Great shelf-liner!,"The liner itself is excellent for my purposes!I, like others here, think we could save the company some $ on their packing-wares: excess boxing and wraping. By the amount of boxes, hubby feared I was shelf-lining the whole house.Anyway, the product is excellent!"
1,What a waste.,I bought this to line the inside of my kitchen cabinets. I was very disappointed w/ the extremely poor quality. It looks (& feels) like cheap paper towels. Definitely a mistake & not @ all worth the money.
1,COLOR IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHITE,"THE DESCRIPTION SAID THE COLOR WAS WHITE AND WHEN IT ARRIVED ON THE OUTSIDE WAS ALSO MARKED ""WHITE"" .... AS I HAVE WHITE CABINETS. THE COLOR THAT IT REALLY IS A TRUE OFF WHITE /ECRU .. VERY YELLOW COLOR .. IT IS NOT JUST A NICE OFF WHITE .. IT IS BIEGE /YELLOW / OFF WHITE .. I OPENED BEFORE I REALIZED AS I THOUGHT IT WAS TAN WRAPPING PAPER AROUND WHITE ROLL .. IF COLOR DOESNT MATTER ..THEN OK .. IF IT DOES AND YOU WANT WHITE.. THIS ISN'T IT .. I DON'T LIKE WHEN I ORDER EXPECTING ONE THING AND GET ANOTHER .. ANNOYED .. THX"
2,Too Small,"This scoring tool scores the paper nicely (including heavier weights, I've done up to 110# with good results, though the heavier weight papers will still crack when folded if scored against the grain); however, it is far too small and lacks a good fit in the hand, thus it constantly runs off course (even when using a steel ruler as a guide), resulting in the need to reprint the piece and recut, ultimately causing a loss of money (in ink cost/paper cost/time in trimming/scoring etc.). I might recommend this tool for light home use but NOT for larger jobs where time and money are of concern."
4,The Next Generation of Synthpop,"This very solid compilation introduces the U.S. to a taste of the worldwide resurgence of electronic, melody-driven Romanticism (i.e. synthpop). Outstanding artists include Deep Red, La Floa Maldita, Beborn Beton, and Apoptygma Berzerk. Also includes a fabulous cover of Yaz's Situation. A must for anyone looking for the next generation of New Wave."
3,Museo Rosenbach - 'Zarathustra' (BMG International),"Originally released in 1973,this was the Italian progressive/art rock band's debut album.Italian prog has never done all that much for me,personally.But,I thought I'd give this CD a listen.A couple of decent tracks,here ""Al Di La' del Bene E del Male"" and ""Degli Uomini"" sort of reminded me of Emerson Lake & Palmer (the playing,anyway).Line-up:Lupi-vocals,Enzo Moregno-guitar&vocals,Pit Corradi-organ&mellotron,Alberto Moreno-piano&bass and Giancarlo Golzi-drums,tubular bells&vocals.Heard they made a come back twenty-some years later with an effort,'Exit'.I'll have to check that CD out sometime."
2,save your money...,"If you want to read about a troublemaking Marine's non-combat misadventures, you might like this book. That's what it's mostly about. But if you're interested in first-person WWII combat stories, save your money. This may be the most boring book about WWII that I've ever read. In my opinion it doesn't hold a candle to E.B. Sledge's With The Old Breed, probably the best combat memoir to come out of WWII, nor to the classic memoirs of such soldier/sailor-authors as Donald Burgett or James Fahey."
4,A Grand Read,"This was the finest first person account of any war account I have read. Robert Leckie wrote this in such a way that I felt I was there with them all. No wonder he held most of the officers in contempt, but then he did bring some problems on himself. But as the old saying goes, ""Boys will be boys."" A worthwhile read, one I highly recommend."
3,helmet for my pillow,"It was a good book but it lacked in the military history that I was looking for. I wanted to read more about specific battles, etc. However, it was still a good read from a participant"
4,Hello,Honesty about himself_ is what I Appreciated the most. His resentment of the favored officers and then his own forgiveness of them. Great story!
1,What was that?,"Bought this book after learning ""The Pacific"" would be partially based on Leckie's book and, being a Marine for 30+ years, I was curious. Now, having read his book, I wonder why he joined the Corps? A lot of the book is about liberty and getting over on SNCO's and Officers. His self-serving way of life often got him into trouble with the officers and SNCO's whom he generally regarded with contempt for holding him accountable. The end of the book was disappointing. About six days into Pelelieu he gets wounded - September 1944. The next thing you know the bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. Nothing for a year and for all his experience and trials he ends the book with this ""big, BAD bomb"" ending as if the US cheated the Japanese. The book's a crock! Save your money, buy MAD magazine. At least you know, up front, what you're paying for."
3,Helmet for my Pillow,This book was a disapointment. I had only read good reviews. Was expecting alot more.
3,Helmet For My Pillow,"I found the book to be written in a way that might be considered ""over the head"" of most normal readers. Leckie used many words that I had to look up (and I'm not exactly a dolt having earned a college master's degree). The phrase ""keep it simple, stupid"" kept popping into my mind. I think it was a bit pretentious and therefore off-putting. I found his narrative hard to follow especially at the beginning of the book and during the combat sequences. All in all, read E. B. Sledge's ""With the Old Breed on Pelelieu and Okinawa. It's much better."
3,Verbose,This author continues in his established mode of writing: never use one word when four will work and utilize hyperbole whenever possible. I got through two chapters and had enough. Great material but buried in overdone wordiness.
4,Get into a marine's mind,Not really a war memoir. The author describes more the times before and after the battles. The reader can experience the transition from untrained civilian to veteran. Mixed into the story are the surreal exploits of the marines in Australia after Guadacanal. Fine companion piece to the other books used as a basis for the HBO series.
3,Not exactly an admirable story,"Leckie is one of the best first-person authors of World War II. He has a very interesting style of writing - better than Ernie Pyle. Unfortunately, I read soldier autobiographies for inspiration. I like to read about stories of courage, self-sacrifice, and endurance. Although Leckie experienced combat, a great deal of his book is about either pilfering food from supply trucks and supply dumps or trying to escape MPs. I have no doubt these episodes probably took place in the lives of many men in the war, but it's not terribly inspiring. I found that I wanted to skip over large portions of his shore leave just to get to his life on the line. There are plenty of other WW2 autobiographies that are more interesting (such asBaa Baa Black Sheep)."
2,Paled in Comparison,"After reading Pacific, and seeing the suggested reading for ""Helmet"", I bought it expecting a comparable read. I was sorely disappointed. Instead of an account of the war, I found an account of how to avoid the war. One trip to the sick bay and brig after another. A recalcitrant malcontent who took more pleasure in having a good time and using $6 words that are lost on most. I would not recommend this read to anyone interested in learning how the Marines fought in the war."
2,Didn't like writing style,"Really didn't care for the style of narrative in this book, it was really tedious and kind of annoying. I stopped reading it about halfway through and I'm not sure if I'll ever pick it back up to finish it. It just wasn't that interesting to me."
1,author seems too self serving,Read like a poetry contest. Author seemed to be trying to write like robert frost or something. Appreciate your service. Didn't care for the writing style though.
3,Good book. Took a long time to receive!,"Book arrived one day later than expected. My gripe is that it took 3 weeks to receive from time of shipment. With the price for shipping, I would expect to receive it within a week. Books I order from other vendors do not take that long to receive!"
2,War Stories- Not Book About War,"The battle scenes are played down, the anecdotal ""sea stories"" are played up. Do you really want to know which company is camping out in the soccer stadium downtown, or how you met an Australian driving a jeep full of supplies, hell to the NO! My feeling are to preserve his own sanity the author went short on detail. Waste if money. CVN65 forever!"
4,Excellent First Person Account,"This book is a personal account of someone who was really there. I enjoyed ""The Pacific"" so much on HBO, I felt compelled to read it. I have a whole new respect for the marines in Japan, including my own uncle, Daniel Grego, of blessed memory. I had no idea what he went through.This and Eugene Sledge's ""With the Old Breed"" are must reads if you are interested in personal accounts of WWII on the Pacific front and not just interested in history books or something written from the third person.My only complaint is the ""text to speech"" on my Kindle was not enabled."
3,Over the top,"I must reluctantly admit that I was disappointed with the book. It was, at many times, a difficult and laborious read. Leckie's style in this book is that of a poet, rather than one who has been through war. While it is a unique perspective and telling, it struck me as an over the top attempt to impress with a unnecessary onslaught of metaphors and analogies. Some sentences strung on for well over a hundred words, comprising their own paragraphs. Not everything needs to be found analogous to something else. If you want to read the memoirs of one of the characters from HBO's The Pacific, I'd recommend Eugene Sledge's ""With the Old Breed."" If you enjoy prose and excessive comparisons, you would probably like Leckie's memoir."
4,helmet for my pillow,"Book arrived in good condition. Thank you. I have not yet had a chance to read it, but reviews I have read have all been good."
5,A different kind of war story,"Lecke's lyrical style is often at odds with the subject - survival in battle - but it is because of this that his story stands out as an exceptional narrative of his experiences as a Marine in WWII. The efficient technique of using descriptive names (Runner, Commando, etc) for his real life comrades goes along way towards providing a picture of each character that the reader retains throughout the book. It also allows the author to be judgmental without the need to justify and explain his feelings."
3,Reads like a SAT vocab book,"The story is OK, but Robert Leckie isn't a great writer. The most mundane details are written using ridiculously overblown language. Sneaking out of doing chores is written as ""By some subterfuge we evaded this odious duty"". It gets old."
3,wordy,The book by E.B. Sledge was much more enjoyable more 'readable'. Leckie goes overboard several times describing things. After a while I just got tired of reading the many ways he could describe an event or situation and skipped to the next paragraph.
2,Not an educational read,"I wanted to know more about the Pacific Theater since all my prior readings have been of the European Theater. I've read With the old Breed and then China Marine, both by E.B. Sledge. I watched the HBO series, The Pacific. I've read The Last Stand of Fox Company (which admittedly was about the Korean conflict). As such, I'd regard myself as having some basis for ""observing"" the war in the Pacific.Leckie's book, Helmet for my Pillow, in comparison to the above,is,in a word, ""blah"", i.e., maybe a fun book for some, but definitely not a serious read for students of WW II. Frankly, I was looking for a companion read to the Sledge ""Breed"" book. But, after getting about a third of the way through this book, I found it too boring to continue so returned it to the library (other Kindle readers, take note!). I got my ""fix"", as it were, with E.B. Sledge--best account of the war in the Pacific, and of his time in China after the defeat of the Japanese hands down."
3,Helmet for my pillow,"After watching the first part of the TV miniseries, The Pacific, I went and bought several books about the war in the Pacific. Of the four I read, this one was the most poorly written and seemingly short on the actual details of the skirmishes. The author writes in detail about their furlough in Melbourne other stories that don't blend in with the actual war. Instead of the lengthy writing about their furlough I would liked to have been guided through the war with maps, documents etc. I was expecting more about their campaigns compared to others at the same time in that theater. Written in 1957 the book has been republished in 2010. I was expecting a more concise report of the conficts."
5,In the Beyond close to hell,"This book is a prose poem. It takes the madness of war to the realm of poetry and philosophy. It will stick to you until you die. Beware. You are entering the realm of hell. You and me weren't there. But....You and me and all the readers will come close..as close as you can get. Now, if you are of a certain age...the age much close to the end than the beginning...you had a father or an uncle who was once when he was young deep into the muck of WWII and likely you never understood it...never questioned the 'good' war' because it just wasn't done. Well the author does question it and the answer is out there in the wind that never ever seems to stop blowing. Not ever. Read this at your own risk. Do not read it if you value sleep above all else.How does one rate the horror? Ten stars or ....zero because of the fallibility of our leaders. Your choice. Sleep well readers. Sleep well."
3,kford memphis tn,the book itself was a great story about the war in the pacfic during world war two however the book itself could have been a little more in detail on the historical side of the pacfic conflict.
3,A good story,This is a good story of a Pacific War marine but the author spends a lot of time recounting his recreational antics.
4,WWII - South Pacific - Marines,"A wonderful book, and one that was used as the foundation for the HBO mini-series ""The Pacific."""
4,The Man Can Write,"Robert Leckie, machine gunner and then scout in the 1st Marine Division, retells his battle experiences on Guadalcanal, New Britain and the horrific losses suffered on Peleliu. In addition to the battle descriptions, this rebel and admitted brig-rat, writes of time spent in the brigs and bars from the states to the South Pacific. The loss of friends and the meaning of war itself are woven into the narrative with skill absent any maudlin sentiment. He paints a vivid picture of the fear brought on by night in the jungle during war. ""I could not see, but I dared not close my eyes lest the darkness crawl beneath my eyelids and suffocate me. I could only hear. My ears became my being and I could hear the specks of life that crawled beneath my clothing... I could hear the darkness gathering against me and the silences that lay between the moving things."" If this is ""brig-rat"" writing, then bring on more of it."
5,Loved it.,"I was wondering why this book wasnt on the commandant's reading list, until I actually read the book. Robert Leckie by his own accord was a great Marine in combat, but not so much when not in combat. I thought it was a great companion book to ""With the old breed."""
4,Captivitaing from the first page,This was one of those books I did not want to put down. I would rate it a 9 on the 10 scale.
3,Read it for drill and memories,"It was good , but I was a Marine at Camp Lejeune and some of the liberty he took was not the normal areas that was possible to far and to costly , with taxi's and trains."
3,Helmet for my Pillow,"Mr. Leckie was proud of his flowery writing skills but they are over the top, way over the top. I have read books written by his peers and they are so much better. I have all the respect in the world for men like Bob Leckie as they represent a generation of American that had the level of pride in their country that it took to defeat an incredible foe in the Japanese warriors. We should all strive to regain their spirit of love for America."
3,Helmet for My Pillow,"Not the best account of what it must have been like to go through the pure hell of the pacific campaign. There are better reads out there on the same subject,"
4,Really like this book,"This book was engaging. I found it hard to put down. Very entertaining. No wonder they used it for HBO series ""The Pacific"". I would recommend it. It has some funny stories in it."
5,Good option for non-readers,"Because of deteriorating eyesight my husband, who used to be an avid reader, has found this format to be a great way to keep up on his ""reading"". Saw this book listed in the credits of ""The Pacific"". Amazon.com has everything...found the MP3 CD format and he's enjoying the book."
4,Big but good,I actually love this knife. When it got here it was a lot bigger than I expected (evidently I don't actually know how big ten inches is) but it works great. It is amazing how much easier it is for me to cut and chop with a knife that actually holds and edge.
2,"10 "" chef knife","I use my knives for work and my 10 "" knives see a lot of products. This one is on the light weight side, it dose the job but for higher bucks I am getting something I can really rip, chop, slice and destroy any thing in my path.Thank you."
1,Read the book instead,"I didn't think it was possible to take the magic out of Pippi Longstocking, but this movie succeeds in spades. The songs are cringe-worthy, the story is choppy, and Pippi just isn't Pippi.Read the book to your kid instead."
2,This is not Japanese anime,"A sham of a popular kids' show and book, and they should be shot for trying, I find this animated flick uninteresting. Pippi Longstocking wasn't anything that would ever be considered even close to ""funny."" Sure, it had a few throwback ""badda-bing, badda-bang"" moments, but nothing even close to a cartoon-fest. Mainly, it should be filed under the category ""stupid."" Why? The only reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars is because of the non-anime thing and that it was absolute garbage. That was beautiful.So, if you're at home bored with nothing to do... don't watch this. Watch something good."
4,My Daughter loves it.,"My daughter has been a Pippi fan ever since I introduced it to her at the age of 12 months. Now 2 years old, she loves this animated version, but perfers the one of the 90s with Tami Erin. She likes the songs in this one, and I don't think they are so bad. It took me a while to get used to them though! This isn't like the original Pippi that we all know and love so well, but it is a cute, modern, animation to the beloved classic."
2,not happy,"The case says that it comes with english subtitles, but there are none on the dvd. almost the entire documentary is in Hindi, not english."
2,NOT A DOCUMENTARY but a heartwarming story,This is not a movie about children born into brothels but rather a story about a middle-aged photo journalist who goes to Calcutta to document women who work in brothels. Into her project she loses interest in her subject matter and instead decides to teach a photography class to children. While teaching the class she discovers that they probably have more talent than she does so she decides to try to get them away from their families and homes and friends to send them all off to boarding schools which in her opinion would be a better life for them (and make her feel better about herself as well). While you might say this is a documentary about her it is not a documentary about children born into brothels as the title would suggest.
3,What the heck?,"I too enjoyed this film immensely....what I could understand, that is. I thought there were no subtitles; they certainly didn't come up. I was very frustrated. And then, watching the bonus materials (of 3 years later, which should be part of the film itself), there they were. Grrr..... I watched most of the film in fast forward because I couldn't understand what anyone was saying. I've never had a problem like this, but see that I am not the only one. BUT, some scenes transcend language. When those kids went to the beach, and then back home, I cried. It was so poignant, both at the beach, and then back home. Anyway, I wish I had known that the subtitles could possibly be tricked into working, but it's too late now!"
3,All about the kids...,"It's true, there are moments when you get the sensation these children are fodder for the filmmakers, but beyond any criticisms a review might offer, making this film was worth it if only to give the world an opportunity to see the kids, in all their disadvantaged squalor, make us feel more than a touch spoilt and grasping. We realize we could ourselves just as easily been born into brothels. Their amazing to watch. The Oscar has to go to them."
3,"exellent movie, BAD dvd","This is an excellent movie. Why do the movie studios put UNAVOIDABLE previews before the movie? You can't skip past them. I DO NOT want to wait through these same previews every time I put the dvd in the player. The best you can do is turn off the TV, and go do something else. This makes me hate Think Films. Apparently, they're not thinking of the consumer, and don't own DVD players themselves."
3,"like ingrid bergman said: ""oh those poor little brown babies ... """,a heartfelt examination of little brown children of prostitutes in calcutta and the nice white woman who is trying to save them. it won an oscar as best documentary; i guess there were no movies about the holocaust or aids that year.
4,Harsh Reality,One of the more harsh documentaries I've seen this year. Also one of the best. A must see.
5,Left me wanting more!,I originally bought this dvd for an anthropology class. It was a great video that left me wanting more information. Some of the scenes were hard to watch just because of the way the children were treated. Excellent documentary even for the non-student.
5,Broken Hearts -- Restored Dreams,"Whether it's a tsunami, a an earthquake, a hurricane, a wild fire, or some other variety of global birth-pang, we gather around the TV and watch CNN deliver blow-by-blow images that burn into our brains and crush our hearts.But what about the weight of a different kind of trauma? The kind caused, not by natural disasters, but by the realities of poverty, class leverage, lust or even human choice? Get your mitts on this documentary and you'll see first-hand what can happen when a single person receives and embraces a vision that tanscends the scope of their own ability and resources and conects with the hearts and passions of people for whom ""hope"" isn't just a word that's hard to define, but that's completely unknown.Do yourself a favor and watch this documentary. And be sure to also watch the DVD extras found on this extraordinary film."
3,This seller did not list that this was an ex-library copy.,"I love this movie, and I needed a nice, clean copy for one of the classes I teach. I ordered a ""very good"" copy, and the seller did not list that it was an ex-library copy. The jacket was covered in library text, and the movie was battered. It should have listed that in the product info-- I wouldn't have purchased that copy."
4,Daddies pretty little forget me nots!,"Shot in the brothels of India, this movie is a testament to the purity and courage of children. Though it's hard to believe, women from poorer cultures are still forced into sexual servitude. Sometimes the aftermath of these liasons is the children they birth and care for at the seedy international brothels they work in. While it may be hard to watch, Born Into Brothels is an interesting and enlightening movie."
1,Huckster Huckster Huckster Huckster,Open your eyes. This is a huckster and a known huckster. Check with 'Quack Watch' online. Anyone who misuses an MD Degree to cheat people should go to jail. The medical profession loses credibility when people like this sell snake oil and call it life-saving - Out on his yacht in California where he lives in luxury (in Beverly Hills) he is probably laughing out loud that there are so many gullible people willing to believe his scam.
4,Just as the book states - An Amazing Herbal Bible,I usually don't write book reviews but this one is an exception. The author Earl Mindell has an ensychlopedia of information about herbal and traditional remedies. The best part is he goes into depths as to what these herbs do and how they can heal you. I refer to this book a lof and it is an important part of my kitchen books. I recommend it.
3,Doesn't touch all the bases,"Good place to start,but even a novice like myself knows the dangers of using MAO inhibitors(like passionflower,yohimbe and St.John's Wort which are ""covered"" in this book)with fermented cheese,meat and beer and wine-Mindell doesn't even mention this-He also recommends a starting point for dosage as a tablespoon per cup(it's actually 1 1/2 teaspoons to be safe)-But,really,if you know nothing at all about herbalism,this is a good enough book."
3,Still need to cross reference with other sources to ensure safety,Still need to cross reference with other sources to ensure safety. I guess like any medicinals research updates and may even lend some differences of opinions. Cross referencing is the only safe way to use any guide like this one.
2,Well it works........ sort of.,"I bought a pair of these stands before I knew how shoddy hisonic stuff was. If you read reviews for other hisonic products (like their wireless mics, cheap price, cheaply made) you'll know to avoid this speaker stand already. But for everyone else, let me say for the record this stand is very poorly made. The head (the part the speaker is supposed to sit on) is rounded off, which makes the speaker wobble - it is impossible to make the speaker face forward, it will only sit pointed slightly up or slightly down. The clamp at the base that keeps the shaft from sliding down is a screw, and it is very hard to screw it in tight enough to support even lightweight speakers.Cheap price, cheaply made. Buy it only if you have a lot of ibuprophen or tylenol on hand, because you WILL get a headache."
2,Not what it seems,"I give a 2 for misinformation, I am just disappointed of the outcome.My husband purchased this tripod so he can use his speakers when he has gigs. the item isn't like what the discription says.they should hold the behringer he also purchased since his small speakers blew. as described, can support up to 150LBs. the diamiter says 1.38 inch..., not true it is less, 1 inch or 3/4 inch which makes for a very unstable,poorly made, weak stand., also when the base is adjusted to a specific height and it is secured it doesnt stay. I emailed Seller to see if my husband can get reimbursed. Got a reply and ask to send them back.I am sorry that my husband purchased these."
1,YAWN ...,"I can only surmise that this book was in the True Crime section because they didn't know where else to put it. With fictional detectives, imaginery conversations, no trial, no forensics and very little investigation, it lacks everything a true crime fan loves! Scant attention is paid to the actual crime itself with the overwhelming bulk of the book spent on various town residents' beliefs of who and who didn't do it. I kept reading, hoping it would improve, but often found myself needing a ""bitter brew"" to stay awake!"
3,Interesting Book,"The book was interesting to read, but it left me with many questions about what really happened in the end."
5,Nonstop Guilty Pleasure,"This is one of those books that I started reading in the store because I liked the cover, then couldn't put down once I got home. I don't understand all the controversy over this book, seems like the writer wove a great tale and stayed true to what happened in that crazy little Maine town. It's not your usual true crime novel; but then again, I find Ann Rule's books overly long and sometimes tedious. This is a good book for just lying around on the couch after Thanksgiving dinner and relaxing. One thing I did notice, the people who say they don't like it must have finished it because the only recipe in the book is at the very end! Give it a try, it's pretty damn good."
5,"Shocking, entertaining, and full of black humor",How can murder by poison take place in a tiny rural church? I started this book and got engrossed from the first page. This is a well-written journey into the minds of so-called Christians engaged in a deadly power struggle.I loved this book.
3,Main Blower Motor,"This motor is a replacement for the main blower motor in a 91 Toyota Previa. The good thing about it is that it fits in the original location, as I read that many replacement motors did not. HOWEVER this motor is not of a very good quality. Does not spin freely. Makes a lot of noise, and does not attain the speed (CFM) of the original motor. My only suggestion would be that possibly to spend some extra dollars and get a better motor. But then again the van is over 20 years (that is how long the original motor lasted), so a few more years from this motor may be all that is required. Not recommended for those who would really like performance."
2,Not what I expected but not bad either.,"I love Duran Duran and was so excited to get this video. This video is just for serious fans only. I did not know what to expect with this video. I had hoped a few interviews from the band or some minor video clips. The entire hour is music critics and Paul Berrows discussing the music and impact of D2, hence the title the Ultimate review. Small clips of music, but nothing really to note. It is a must for Duran fans only."
3,This book adds positive work to many areas but not....,"to the main subject of the book. As many know the chronology of the Pharaohs is an area that needs much work and as pointed out in this book and many others the co-reign of Pharaohs isn't well documented.Here is the problem with this work; there is better evidence to place Hatsheput at the time of Solomon and Amenemhet IV as the Pharaoh of the Exodus.This work is worth the time to read the many stories of the main characters in finding Tutankhamun tome and about thier beliefs, life and times."
4,entertaining and fun,"I ordered the dart board because we had a real one, and with animals in the house it scared me to be using real metal darts. This board has lots of features, and wonderful when you have company. So far, we've had no problems with bounce outs. The boys throw very aggressivly though and the darts want to stick into the holes. Also, the darts it comes with are not very good quality. We broke one the first night and the tags won't stay on. I plan on buying some better darts to go with it, but the board was worth it because it keeps score for so many games and up to 8 people. I'd recommend the game for anyone, any age."
1,Breaks Easily,"I do like the dart board and its features. The problem is that after about a months worth of use the panels on the board are breaking. One I can understand but when 5 have broken in less then 2 months that is not what I would call a quality product. I have contacted the company 3 times about part numbers to replace the panels but I have gotten no reply. I am disappointed in the service that I have received from the company.March 8, 2012I again contacted the company with no luck on getting my issue resolved. Their are problems with player being skipped or some of the electronics not working properly. All of the red segments encased in the inner circle are borken and some of the triple and double segments are broke. It is a nice board but it it not long lasting. I do not recommend this board. DMI Sports attempted to help but then dismissed me as a customer and is no longer in contact."
1,Very disappointing purchase,Product was returned as defective. Suspect very poor manufacturing quality control (China) as game would reset every time after throwing a few darts.
5,Great Fun,"We were skeptical about the electronics, but the board is great fun for our grandkids (7 yrs and up) and adults. The kids love the heckler (it also cuts down on their own heckling - nice), but you can also turn it off. We move the boarder lower for the little kids. Highly recommend this as a fun addition. Only problem is the darts that come with it are worthless. Many good darts are available. We found some decent quality ones at Walmart for under $10."
2,Broke Swiftly,"It was good for a couple of weeks, then I started having problems that continue to now. After fifteen or twenty darts, the game just resets and deletes all progress, making it impossible to actually use the electronic system. The board itself is fine, but it is prone to a lot of bounceouts.Other than that, the darts are terrible, but I expected that and wasn't counting on them. I did, however, expect a basic functionality in the board itself, and it is really frustrating that it was so quick to break."
4,AC Adapter voltage incorrect,"Electronic Dart Boards - Arachnid Inter-Active 3000 - Heckler FeatureThis dart board is fun and works well. However, the AC adapter that came with it has an output of 17 VDC and I'm afraid to plug it in. I have been unable to contact the seller. This is second adapter to have this problem."
2,Not impressed,"I wasn't really impressed with this dart board. It did everything it said it would, but i wasn't impressed by the way the darts hit the board. I should have spent more money to get a better one."
2,not too impressed...,this product was a disappointing.it was not tournament quality. it was more like a toy and the heckling feature was very annoying. we sent it back.
3,Offers some fun games; darts not so great,"I bought this dartboard game for my grandson, and we all had fun with it...for awhile. The board is great, but darts keep losing their guide ""feathers"". Several reviewers recommended buying a better quality set of darts, which I did, but they, too, kept losing the guide feathers. It seems that they could be put on permanently instead of slipping them into slots that they can so easily slip out of and get lost. We've bought more dart sets since, and they all seem to have the same problem."
3,Mace cant fight without the force,Overall its a good book. Although i tend to think the author made him(Mace) look a little weak. I loved the battles with Kar Vastor. Why Master Bilba lost her mind isnt exacly clear to me.
3,This book will live in the Jedi Archives for millenia!,"I very enjoyed the book. It does give you a big does of ""Mace"" - Jedi Master who we know little about. I found certain aspects of the book to be out of character with what we know or are told about the Jedi in general. His use of Jedi powers at times seemed to be weak at some points, but explosive and 'all powerful yoda like' at other times? I don't feel they explain why Depa did what she did? I definately found this to be a very dark book and one of the more graphically violent of the ones I have read. While I did enjoy it, I can only give it a 3 rating in my mind. The ending of the book seemed hurried and unbelievable? May the force be with you!"
3,I'm in a minority,"I really looked forward to reading this book. It got so much hype and I thought it would be great. For reasons unknown to me, Stover's style is very difficult to read for me. I found the same to be true in Traitor. In theory, I like his style but to read it was a chore.However, got to love an Akk Dog!"
3,ok book,"I heard a lot of positive things about this book, which unfortunately were not correct. a ho-hum average star wars novel, not as bad as many but definitely a rung below the best ones. fair"
2,Don't think I can get through it...,"OK, so I'm now halfway through this book, and I just don't think I can make it through the other half...1) far too much exposition, which, despite all the action scenes, makes this a very slow read; 2) it just doesn't feel like a Star Wars novel...it feels like a couple of Star Wars characters are layered upon an pre-existing story idea by the author (or perhaps another author, say Joseph Conrad)...anyway, it's not really a bad story, but it doesn't seem to shed much light on the larger ""Star Wars"" story...which is why, for me, it ultimately fails, and at this point I can't imagine picking it back up to read the remaining 200 pages"
5,Shatterpoint shows stand-alone Star Wars novels can rule.,"Out of all the Clone Wars novels, Shatterpoint is by far the best. Taking the character of Mace Windu to new heights and depths, the novel shows how emotion can still tear at even a Jedi Master's soul. It portrays the horrors of war in the way that one can't help but sympathize with the characters as they witness and experience them. Overall, a great novel that any fan of Mace Windu, let alone fan of Star Wars, should definitely read."
4,The Heart of Darkness in a Star Wars Vietnam,This book goes into a lot of detail about a bush war on Mace Windu's home planet. The dangers of jungle warfare and the brutality of war. It's Robert Conrad meets George Lucas meets Francis Ford Copola.
2,Slow slow slow slow and boring,Shatterpoint is pretty bad but it's so slow so many pages are just constant talking. It doesn't move the story at all. What is a 414 page book should be just around 250. It takes a good plot but it just is unbearable. I can't bear to finish shatterpoint and I don't think you could too
2,No plot,"The book has no plot. Such a contention sounds ludicrous, but read it yourself. It took me 11 months to get through it (whilst going through about 25 other novels in the same period).Ideas and creativity are severely lacking in this book. The author can write ""well"" in a technical sense, but his writing has no ""meaning"" behind it.I think he was the perfect choice, however, for writing The revenge of the Sith, as Lucas only needed someone to flush out his own ideas.The author needs to spend a few years developing his creativity before writing books."
3,What the hell is THIS?,"A lot like he did in Traitor, Stover uses a bunch of words to say very little. The point he makes here is: war is deadly to every part of one's being. Gee, REALLY!! Who would've thunk it. Making it worse was the fact that this resembled `Nam more than it did The Clone Wars. Matter of fact, you could hardly tell this was set in The Clone Wars since it had no impact on it or much mention of it.Seriously, is it too much to ask for a CW novel to have something to do with the war. Come to think of it, hardly any of this CW novels have had many fights with battle droids or Dark Jedi. It's really az shame too."
1,Similar to prequel movies,"I felt the book was similar in terms of the quality of the movie. A character you want to learn about during an interesting time period. And that ends the good part. I really couldn't get into it, I wound up skimming through it just to find out about the apprentice jedi and even then it was a disappointing read. I don't think I've come across a good prequel star wars book other than dark hunter (the one with Darth Maul) or a good movie."
4,"Good story, more insight into Mace Windu",Exciting and interesting story that gives a lot more insight into Mace Windu's back story and actions in the Star Wars movies.
4,"""Star Wars"" meets ""Heart of Darkness"" - AWESOME COOL!","I stumbled across this book quite by accident - my 8 year old son (who is falling in love with Star Wars as much as his old man did) brought it home from the library.he didn't read it - said it was ""boring"".I read it.....and LOVED it! Finally - a star wars novel for someone older than 12!Nice job on the writing, Matthew! Lots of literary references (including the horror of the heart of darkness). A small point, but i found some of the cultural anachronisms that crept into the dialog...........but this IS fantasy, after all.I really appreciated the humor that the author put into the book.This book would make a TERRIFIC movie, IMHO! I hope Hollywood picks up on this one......or else George Lucas should hire Matthew to write the screenplays for other star wars movies."
2,Seriously?,"First of all the book has lots of gore in it I mean come on,it's Star Wars people! Second of all it's depressing. I mean seriously? just don't buy this book if you don't like gore and depressing storylines ok? Don't buy it."
4,"a great book about the ""Haruun Kal crisis"" (4.5 rounded to 4)","Finally, a novel about one of my favorite Jedi of all time. The main plot is very good. Mace Windu's fromer Padawad, Depa Billaba, is sent to Mace's home planet of Haruun Kal to battle the Seperatists. Once there, the Republic hears there is a CIS pullout of the system. Yet Depa still hasn't returned. From there, Mace has to go and investigate and find out what's happend. Shatterpoint was an excellent book made better just because it was about Mace Windu. It also added more depth to a really one-sided character from the movies. The one problem about this book is towards the middle, Mace is wandering through the jungle for a long time (or what seemed like 75 pages). Still a good read for Star Wars or Mace Windu fans alike."
1,A case of arrested development,"Matthew Woodring Stover is the perfect author for a prequel book, in that like George Lucas, his emotional and moral development stalled at the age of fourteen. Mind you, a bright, precocious fourteen, but still. Writing sci-fi of this nature is the profession you take up if you, like Peter Pan, never want to grow up. And what you read if ditto."
2,"Meh, predictable and sort of lame.",I have read almost all of the SW universe novels... it wasnt the worst SW books I've read but it wasnt great either.
3,Pretty Good Read but No Classic,"I found this book to be an interesting one but at times some of the action scenes bordered on the ridiculous and were way overdone. I felt at times that Mace acted out of character from the way he is presented in the movies. I enjoyed the story overall and feel that Stover captured the feel of a planet torn by strife, genocide, war, and suffering in a very powerful way. This is one of the darkest Star Wars books that I have ever read. I found the book to be an enjoyable read overall but I don't think it is one of the better Star Wars books that I have ever read."
2,This is painful to read!,"I have read no less than 70 Star Wars books and to some degree or another, loved each one until now. This book is so long winded! I'm on page 205 and can hardly stand it. 200 more pages of this? This book easily could have been cut in half."
4,Excellent book,I bought this in an airport bookstore as fodder for a cross-county flight and ended up not being able to put it down. This is a great book. Deep plotting and character development far beyond what George Lucas was ever capable of combined with fast-paced action make this EU title a must have for any Star Wars fan.
4,Good wrestling show,"Man don't be a mark and pay even 15.00 for this old tape. The guy selling it must have went out and bought them all from the local Video Shack. Anyhow I was at the show and it was really good, but I am not endorsing some crackdiculous price for a wrestling vid. out"
1,Tedious event from the NWA,"It's actually bizarre to think what the NWA COULD have been in 1990, if Ric Flair, Jim Ross and Ole Anderson hadn't wielded so much power. The ""Main Event"" here sees Sting take on a masked mystery man called ""The Black Scorpion"" who everybody knew was Flair, for the World Title. The only real suprise here is that Flair loses. But fear not boys and girls, he won the belt back 2 weeks later. Lex Luger, the most popular wrestler at the time, goes up against the horribly old and out-of-shape Stan Hansen for the US Title in a strap match. The Horsemen battle Doom in a heatless Tag Title Match, and most disgustingly of all, there is an ""international tag team tournament"" where various Americans pretend to be from other countries, en route to the Steiner Brothers' inevitable win. Thankfully, within 6 months, Flair and Anderson would both have been fired from their respective jobs."
5,AT LEAST 5 Great hits,"I had it on order weeks before it was released and being a big fan of Mr Raye, I may be biased. He has turned down the tempo a bit and put in more love ballads on this album, from his hit ""Couldn't Last a Moment"" to the best song in my opinion on the album - ""Landing In Love"". There are at least 5 songs that give me goosebumps (fewer than his ""The Walls Came Down"" album). I suspect that ""She's Gonna Fly"" will be played at many funerals. He is continuing to sing songs that touch people in ways that move the soul."
5,one of the best cd this year,"this cd is great it has alot of good songs on it.i think he is one of country music best singer. he has a great voice.my mom has all his cd's and we always listen to them when we are at home or in the car.like i said before this cd's is one of his best. you can't go wrong with it. i like to listen to expecialy is SHE GONNA FLY. i think that is the best song he had in along time..... so,go buy this cd and you won't be sorry that you did!"
3,ONE OF THE BEST CD FOR THE YEAR 2OOO,"COLLIN IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGER.I LIKE TO LISTEN TO HIS MUSIC.MY MOM HAS ALL HIS CD'S AND I THINK THIS IS HIS BEST SO,FAR.THE SONGS ARE THE BEST! SO,GO BUY THE CD AND ENJOY THE MUSIC. YOU WON'T BE SORRY! LIKE,MY MOM WOULD SAY IT'S THE BEST CD OUT THERE."
4,Better Than Ever!,"Collin Raye has never sounded better than in his new CD. Even with the pop overtones, his voice speaks straight to the hearts of listeners. His current single, ""Couldn't Last a Moment"" is just one of the great songs on this CD. Keep the music coming, Collin!"
1,Collin Raye / Tracks,"What a disappointment. After the excellent ""The Walls Came Down"", it is hard to believe this is the same person. Out of the 12 songs, there are 5 that are OK -- Completely, You Will Always Be Mine, A Long Way to Go, Landing in Love, and Loving This Way. Not one song on this CD is anything to get excited about. I have all of his other CDs except the greatest hits; they all are exceptional. It seems Collin is trying to change his style, and for me it just doesn't work. I'm glad my sister got this from the library so we could listen to it before I ran out and bought it. This CD will not become a part of my collection."
5,I LOVED IT!,"I loved this CD, as I love all of Collin's CDs. The songs are all so great that I have a hard time naming a favorite. However, if I had to choose one, it would probably be ""Harder Cards"", which is another tale of a wife murdering her abusive husband. But this song is told from the viewpoint of the arresting officer, and it's MUCH more serious than the Dixie Chick's ""Goodbye Earl"". My second favorite song on the album is probably the first single ""Couldn't Last A Moment."" The rest of the songs are excellent, also. The last song ""She's Gonna Fly"" is a pretty depressing story about a Grandma dying of Alzheimer's disease. True, this CD isn't as country sounding as some of Collin's previous works, but it's still great! Collin's vocals are emotional, powerful, and moving. Buy this awesome album today. You will not be disappointed!"
5,FINALLY GOT ONE!,I WAS SO VERY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THIS DVD FOR MY GRANDSON FOR CHRISTMAS. THE OTHER DVD'S I HAD COME ACROSS ABOUT THIS MOVIE WERE AT LEASE TWICE AS MUCH MONEY. THE OTHER ONES I FOUND WERE FOR BIDDING. WELLL I HADNT DONE THAT IN A WHILE SO I WAS NOT A WANTED CUSTOMER BECAUSE I HAD NO RATING. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GIVE UP ON FINDING ONE UNTIL I CAME ACROSS YOURS. IT WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND A FAIR PRICE. THANK YOU FOR THE PROMPT SHIPMENT. MY GRANDSON IS GOING TO BE SO HAPPY ON CHRISTMAS DAY. I REALLY APPRECIATED HOW EASY IT WAS TO PURCHASE IT AND RECEIVE IT.
4,Little Giants DVD,"Little Giants DVD - A Good Pop Warner'ish Football Movie. Classic Underdog Story about the Little Giants getting their team ready to play the heavily favorite Cowboys team, with a little help from John Madden and some All Star Football players."
1,Questions,I never received this item in the mail. I received my other movie that i purchased at the same time. I was wondering if there was any way you could research why i never received it?
1,Waste of money,Purchased a few DVD's at one time this was the second one that did not work out of like 6. but was a gift for someone out of state and was never able to get it back to return.
4,good family movie,Purchased this after renting it for my 14yr old daughter. She is the youngest of 8 and this was a favorite for my older children. My daughter wanted to own if after watching it and she watches a ton!
4,Refreshing family entertainment!,"Man I never thought those Little Giants would have a chance! I really feel that the cast is superb, even if actors/actresses such as Shawna Waldron (Becky O'Shea), Devon Sawa (Junior Floyd), and Sam Horrigan (Spike) appear to be too old for Pop Warner League football (but each plays his/her part magnificently!). With that aside, this is a movie I would recommend to anyone. It is a cute movie and provides many lessons for kids as they grow to become adults. Great cameos by Madden, Entman, Smith, Brown, and Smith from the NFL!"
1,Never recieved item,Never recieved this item. Hard to review what you don't have. This was suppose to be a gift for my grandson.
1,Little Giants,"I was and still am appalled at the lack of service and consideration that I got from both Amazon and DVD Planet. Both kept stringing me along on a special Christmas order that I made for my brother and then just cancelled the order as they were obviously unable to fulfill it. Of course they did this the day after Christmas. Seems that they had sold it at around 12.00 and both knew that they could then sell it for more. No one helped me, no one cared that my brother got nothing for Christmas. They then had the gall to send an email saying that my problem had been resolved. I am still upset about this and neither Amazon or DVD Planet could care about it."
1,Vendor does not merit a star.,"Nothing best characterizes this vendor better then the term charlatan. I purchased two DVDs for relatives, and paid more more to expedite the delivery of the DVDs prior to Christmas and the movies never arrived. Nor was there any follow-up to my queries. It is now over a month and a half and no product. I would strongly advise anyone against purchasing anything from this vendor."
3,How much is this?!!!!,I grew up with this movie but are yall serious why does this cost so much. Truly this movie should be priced at 8 bucks! Great movie OUTRAGEOUS PRICE.
5,A VERY GOOD MOVIE!,"I like the part when the coach was showing the team how to tackle, fell out the window, and landed on the tree. Very funny.I like the part when the boy pooted and the other kids said whooowee."
5,The Best Sports Movie I Have Ever Seen,"Little Giants was a funny movie that kept you entertained the whole time. The child/teen actors are good, and some can even get on your nerves. (like that cowboy/rancher kid) Spike is funny and so are the adults (Rick Moranis and Ed O'Neill) This movie is more realistic than a lot of other kid baseball movies too. It's a family movie that everyone will enjoy!"
3,Both 1 and 4 stars,"If you like nicely or heavily rhythmic music, the sounds here will do you just fine. I recommend this for just about anyone who has English as a second language. This is the 4 star part: as long as you don't understand the lyrics, this is a fine album, albeit not so exciting as other black or death metal stuff that can be had: I prefer, e.g., Entombed, Pig Destroyer, Atheist, and others.The 1 star part is this: the lyrics are so awesomely bad that the album is virtually unlistenable if you understand English. (This is the same problem that obtains, for example, with Megadeth.) Alas, the lyrics (unlike with another band known for stone bad lyrics, Cannibal Corpse) are intelligible on this CD. Hence, if you can understand English, you won't like this CD. It's a shame."
2,Promising.,"I discovered Hypocrisy when ""The Final Chapter"" went out and went to the library (yes, it had this record!!!) in order to discover Abducted... It s very hard to review, because ""Roswell 47"" and ""SLippin Away"" would no problem be rated 5 starts and the former HAVE to be known by every metal fan.But the rest of the cd is rather unpersonnal, and doesnt bring much to music."
5,Hypocrisy at their absolute best.,"Abducted is another step in their career and it's even better than The 4th Dimension, which is also great. Abducted is how a death metal albums should be like, couldn't have been better. Production's great and a lot better than on their earlier albums, lyrics are also a lot better and the guitar solos and riffs are more mature and professional. The songs are more atmospheric and unique sounding. Abducted is by far, the best Hypocrisy to date."
4,Worth it to spend a little more,"I really love this case because it protects my phone and more importantly it protects my camera lens, but also provides easy access to my camera.I also love the swivel belt clip, very easy to remove and I can spin my phone around and around on it :-)My only complaint would be that it fits too much like a glove at first and it makes it hard to push the appropriate buttons, but it loosens up after a couple of weeks."
3,"Great book, poor edition","I was so disappointed in this Penguin edition. The Penguin Classics usually do a wonderful job with notes at the back, explaining terms and references that are obscure to modern readers. This is a delightful story but the 18th C vocabulary can be tough going, even for those of us accustomed to reading such books. Penguin has left far too many terms unexplained. Unless you've got a Latin reference book, an OED, and historical slang reference books at hand, you're probably going to get frustrated with the language--and you'll miss a great deal of the humor. This edition does Smollett a great disservice. I highly recommend HUMPRHY CLINKER, but I'd advise anyone who isn't an 18th C scholar to buy the Norton Critical Edition instead."
3,Pleasant surprise,"In David McCullough's fine ""John Adams"" he mentions this was one of Adams' favorite books and, upon reading it, McCullough enjoyed it so much he read it twice. On that recommendation I bought it sight unseen. When it arrived I thought I'd made a mistake. A novel made up entirely of letters (correspondence) written in less than easy to penetrate 18th century English. But after slogging through the first dozen pages or so I admit I got hooked. The characters are wonderful and the story line can get very funny. A wonderful window on the 1760s in Great Britain. Using letters to tell the story is clever, although the plot line is constantly told in past tense and there is some redundancy. At any rate, it was worth the effort."
3,Size,"This is a heavy duty well made holder, however the posts are so close together that large sockets cannot be placed next to each other. In addition, the numbers of posts in line are inadequate to place a normal assortment of socket sizes in order.If it were a little larger, it would be perfect"
5,Primary resource material of the greatest interest,The first quantitative analysis of human mental ability. Galton introduced the notion that mental ability was normally distributed in much the same ways as are physical traits. His strong nativistic perspective served as the point of origin for the nature/nurture debate in its modern form.
1,The nespaper Catholic World was right in 1870,"I live in Brazil.I'll be sincere.I tried to read this trash-book, on an internet site.This book is so weak, that I didn't finished it.I read a review published at a catholic newspaper, The Catholic World , in 1870.About this trash-book, cathoilc world newspaper was right and this, in 1870!Well this book has dozens of failures.To example, human inteligence is the subject of this book, but this book never shows, really what is human inteligence.The author himself never had a son.He didn't had descendency, something normal among eugenicists, such as he.Eugenicists were the ecologists of XIX Century.A brazilian told more than forty years ago:""I respect the idiots, because they are eternal."""
2,The turkey jammed my CD player!!!,"What the hell was this band thinking with this shape? I have one of those 5 disc changer stereo's and it got caught while it was closing and almost broke the turkey CD in half! I eventually got it out, but it scared me. I'm selling it on ebay so whay would I want it to break?Oh yeah... It's not all that good either..."
5,SENSUAL & PROVOCATIVE,"THIS CD IS THE BEST THING ON THE MARKET! IT'S LIKE GETTING A VIDEO,MUSIC,AND A BOOK IN AN EASY TO FOLLOW FORMAT. IT'S NOT TOO LONG OR TOO SHORT. THE FIRST TIME MY HUSBAND AND I LISTENED TO IT, WE ONLY MADE IT TO THE 3RD TRACK,BEFORE EXTREME PASSION SET IN. IT'S THE BEST SEX WE HAVE HAD IN YEARS AND IT'S BECAUSE WE ADDED A NEW DIMENSION TO OUR RELATIONSHIP. YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED AT HOW OFTEN WE THINK WE ARE FOCUSED ON EACH OTHER AND WE ARE NOT. THIS CD HELPED US TO TRULY FOCUS ON EACH OTHER. I HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS. THANK YOU FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!"
2,Intimate Interlude was over rated,"I thought the CD was over rated. The instructions were very basic and very rushed. The music was repeated over and over and over again. The music was annoying rather than relaxing. Save your money and buy your favorite music CD. The instructional part was very minimal, nothing we didn't already know. I was very disappointed."
2,Not too impressed,"We purchased two of these for our grandsons, ages 4 and 7. OK, grandkids loved all the ""stuff"" that came with it, but we ended up exchanging one of the rods on the same day we bought it, for another one of them since it would hardly cast out. After fishing with these for a few days, here are the pro's and con's.Pro's: cool set up for kids, lots of neat stuff, great rod length for young onesCon's: doesn't cast very well, but is ok for a little beginner that is mostly interested in playing around. It has red color fishing line on it, which is almost impossible to see the line to thread lures or hooks onto. Also the line is very thin, making it hard to work with."
1,Cheap product,"I bought this kit for my grandson. The first time I took him fishing with it, the rod came apart when he was casting and half of it ended up in the lake, lost. Perhaps it should have been tightened down before use but there were no instructions to that effect so this was a bad purchase."
1,cheap junk/waste of money,We went fishing and couldnt put it together.When we finally put it together the thumb button wouldnt work and the spincast was broken.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!
2,Son broke it in 2-hrs of use,"My son broke this rod within the first 2-hrs he was using it. To be kid friendly, it needs to be made a little better."
5,It's a surprise!,"Purchased this for my very girly nine year old grand daughter. She loves to go fishing with her grandma and now she will have her own rod and reel. I can hardly wait to see her expression when she open the ""kite"" only to see her own pink rod and reel."
1,Warning label,The product contains a warning label indicating that the product contains materials known to cause birth defects. Returned without opening. Buyer beware.
3,Wide Angle & Macro - A beginning,"Received the Wide Angle & Macro Fisheye lens on time as expected. The actual lens is a fun addition to a standard lens (I've mostly used it on my standard kit lens) but quickly creates excessive curves on items towards the extremities of the picture. The macro function is very limited in its usefulness. If I decide to further pursue macro photography I will probably buy a dedicated lens. As for this lens, it is good for creating som fun effects, but nothing more."
3,like it's been said...,"great for fun, i screwed this onto my 18-55 from my rebel xs and got some decent shots for the effect.but when it came down to it, i knew when i purchased it this was only to hold me over for the next few months until i can afford something that can deliver what i need.Sigma 12-24mm f/4.5-5.6 EX DG IF HSM Aspherical Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Camerasbecause i have needs.i experience a pretty noticeable amount of distortion on the outer edges of the shot, nothing that can't be cropped out or ignored.also great to use if you want to add that certain ""character"" to your shot & yet making it seem intentional. or if you're debating whether or not to add a wide angle lens to your collection, try this out first?i think its really fun to unscrew this off my camera & watch peoples faces through it. whoa.seller was excellent, fast shipping! & all that good stuff."
2,Doesn't fit!,Bought it and tried to put it on my camera and it doesn't fit. Someone said I need to buy another lense to put this onto it. Why didn't they tell me that in the first place!
1,Terrible,"I thought this game looked excellent, because the screenshots on the box are very good looking. I was very disappointed when I started playing. There is no action that's worth marveling over. And finally, if you hate strategy games, you'll hate this. Stay away. You'll be glad you did. No wonder it sold for $1.00..."
5,Don't miss LHS's first 6-track mini-CD,"Beautiful, heavy and melodic, this is simply the best.If you like this album, you should also check out their first 6-track mini-CD, ""Shadowdance"", it's fabulous, with a different female singer, who is just as good."
4,Haunted Ohio 4,"HAUNTED OHIO 4 is a book full of short stories about ghosts. These stories are true, as told by the people who experienced them. These hauntings are from all over Ohio. There are stories about pets that come back to haunt, ghosts who leave things such as money, and ones who take things like macaroni.I liked this book because it really makes you wonder if ghosts are real, and if there really could be haunted places. One thing I didn't like about this book was that there is too much extra detail, which lets your attention drift away from the book.In my opinion, HAUNTED OHIO 4 is a good book that should be read by anyone who likes ghost stories."
4,Good Book For Halloween,"This is a great book for people that like ghost stories. Some of the stories are good and some of them are dumb. A good story is the one about the hidden driver.Some of the ones that are bad is the one were some people hear a noise and they think that it was a ghost. It is kind of a hrd book to under stand, but over all it is a good book. The book is about Chris Woodyard going around Ohio and finding ghost stories. I have read a similiar is called the Bone Collecter. It is about a murder that kill people and leaves a bone clue.I think that you should at least read one of the hauted ohio books."
4,"A GREAT, DARK COMIC","This is billed as a horror comic. It is scary, but it resists characterization. The oddest thing about this book is that it takes place within the DC universe. Yes, the tone is VERY dark, and VERY bad things happen--but then there's Superman hanging around in the background...weird. The story begins with a minor DC villain-The Floronic Man. He brings Swamp Thing ""back from the dead"" and then begins doing things far worse than he ever did against the Justice League. It is (literally) the DC universe in Hell.As is Alan Moore's style, he takes over a character and completely re-defines him. Like Miracleman, we find out that Swamp Thing isn't exactly what he thought he was. The art is first-rate-much better than today's standards...subtler, more expertly drawn, with none of those annoying, PhotoShop embellishments. It is a beautiful, fast, disturbing read from start to finish. You'll never look at a swordfish the same way again..."
4,Well it's not The Watchmen but...,It's still pretty darn good. Just the fact that I could find a story about the Swamp Thing enjoyable is pretty amazing but Moore pulled it off. I wasn't even that disturbed by the appearance of other caped-crusaders.Here's what I didn't like: 1) That the plot line was kind of separated into 2 shorter 'themes'. 2) A thread started at the end that is not concluded in the book. 3) A monster that feeds on fear is just not all that original anymore.But remember even with all that I gave it 4 stars.
2,OK,"What can I say. Decent graphics and a typical comic book story. Unlikely to satisfy adults. Again, OK, but hardly a revolutionary work of any kind."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Alan Moore took this as an opportunity to try something completely different with the Swamp Thing character, and pretty much succeeded. While I am not as much a fan of this as some people, it is still pretty good.The Swamp Thing series also introduces to someone perhaps a bit more interesting. John Constantine, Hellblazer."
5,"Exactly as described, A+++","I use only sony MiniDV HD tapes in my Canon XH-A1 camera. These are exactly what I use for shooting HDV, quality is perfect. I ordered these on Monday and had them by Thursday using regular shipping. I would definitely order these again and from the same supplier with no worries."
4,Great Investment,This tape is a little more expensive but it is a better quality than others.Pros:High qualityHigh reuseCons:only 63 minhigher initial investment
3,Sony MiniDV tape,"At $8 a tape (in package of 5), it is cheaper than the ones sold at the local camera store, though the package is meant for overseas market, still, they are good tapes. Will buy again when I need more."
5,Nice quality,Great quality video tapes. Was very satisfied as I captured my vacation on tape. Would recommend to anyone.
3,wrong picture but similar tape,"Maybe this is just a detail for most people. But as stated by Andrea in another post, the product received does not look like anything presented on the picture. Its label states that the tape inside should be the same as on the picture. However the product comes in a different box, and the tapes looks totally different.I like to have all my tapes the same, so their tags are the distinction. But now I have this different tapes. They should perform the same as the description label is similar, therefore this presentation may be for overseas or something else.It may be a small detail; but for me it is important to get exactly the same product as presented on the picture (color, presentation, package, all). If something is different, it builds the question of what else may be different? It is a matter of trust.If after using these tapes I notice a difference, I will post it."
3,Good product,the tapes came in the mail quickly and was decently priced. My only disappointment was that I thought I was buying a five pack as advertised in the picture and was sent 5 individual HD tapes with Chinese markings making me think this product was made for overseas sales. Otherwise I was satisfied with the product.
3,BUY THE OTHER PREMIUMS THERE BETTER,"These are not near what you pay for, save your money and but the other sony premiums, My CANON XL1S Eats these just as well as the others for a fraction of the cost,,,,"
5,Interesting and accurate from the evolutionary perspective,"As someone who has done some research using primary sources about sex appeal from an evolutionary approach, I found this video to be remarkably accurate and up to date (when it was made). I really like that it went to significant lengths to discuss the issues with the researchers who have actually done the empirical research. It presented the viewpoint and supporting research in a way that was both interesting and informative. I use it in my undergrad human sexuality course to start discussion about this topic.It is not really a drawback, but this video really changes course in the last ten minutes. It goes all humanistic to try to make the inherent determinism of the behavior genetics approach a little more palatable for general audiences. It moves from research to philosophy. My classes seem to appreciate that, but it is a switch in direction at the end.Overall, it is an outstanding effort for something that was created for TV."
4,very interesting,"I loved this film. I learned a lot and found this documentary very interesting and intriguing. Science at it's best: why marriages last, why marriages fail, why guys can't quite figure girls out - it's all here."
3,An o.k. watch,"I am surprised by the high ratings. At best, this is an average movie. A lot of the contents were repetitive and none of it was rocket science. Having said that, its still an ok watch. I have watched much worse."
4,It works perfectly well,I bought this product after having spent more than 200 dollars on a Sony box that makes copies from VHS to DVD that only can be seen using the same instrument.Honestech records DVDs that I can see everywhere.I give this product 4 stars. The only thing that keeps me giving 5 stars is because it should work faster. It take too much time to make a copy..
5,Must See,Having sex appeal demystified by science is both funny and disturbing at the same time. Watching this may help someone avoid some of mistakes endemic in courtship behavior.
4,"Good Headset, Excellent Value","I have used this headset for a year and have been very happy with it. The sound quality is very good and the people I call can never tell that I am using a headset. The volume - earpiece and microphone - is quite loud. This makes the headset useable in the car and noisy public places. It supports Bluetooth 2.0 and has good battery life.Probably the most important feature of a headset is the way it fits your ear. Nokia has developed a soft plastic clip for this headset that can adjusted to fit either ear. Once you adjust the clip,the earpiece will sit directly over your ear canal and yield excellent voice quality and volume. This fits adult-size ears best. For children or women with smaller ears, I recommend the smaller BH-200 (I bought it for my wife)."
1,Defective When Shipped,"I was quite surprised to receive this product defective. However, I ordered one from another site and it worked fine."
2,NOT AS DESCRIBED,This item was much smaller than it looked in the picture and smaller than it was described by the seller. It was grossly misrepresented. It is about the size of a beanie baby. I read all the information on this item before purchasing it to make sure it was what I really was looking for. I feel that I was taken advantage of. I will not order anything like this from amazon again.
4,UNPLEASENT,"I BOUGHT THIS AT HALLMARK WHEN IT WAS THE PET OF THE MONTH I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT WAS CUTE AND ONLINE IT SAID THAT IF YOU BUY THE PET OF THE MONTH IN THAT EXACT MONTH YOULL GET A LOOT BAG OF SUPRISES THAT YOU CANT GET ANYWHERE ELSE AND I WANTED TO GET THE LOOT BAG OF SUPRISES AND WHEN I ADOPTED MY PET I DIDNT GET IT!!!! I ONLY GOT THE GIFT BOX THAT IT USALLY GIVES YOU WHEN YOU ADOPT A PET AND I SAID TO MYSELF ""WHAT A WASTE""!!"
5,Very popular,"My daughter got this for a present. She liked the animal well enough, but it was a while before she tried the 'web' part of webkinz. Once she found that, she was hooked. The ability to play with the horse as a virtual pet on-line really added to the appeal of the horse.I was surprised that the web portion allows kids to interact. The members can only select from pre-determined messages, and I haven't seen anything yet that concerns me. But one would still want to supervise any on-line activity.There is a magazine out there that gives webkinz tips on how to get webkinz money, and what foods to get. This can add to the on-line enjoyment."
5,Granddaughter really liked it.,"I got this for a Christmas present for my granddaughter and she is only two, really into horses, so it was perfect."
4,Webkinz pink pony,"My grandaughter loves this toy. It helps her learn about using money, being creative and she can play with it alone or with friends on the computer."
5,Cute and with website it is a very educational toy,"Have to commend the seller . . . there was a glitch with the webkinz code, but the seller came through for me! What great customer service!"
5,Webkinz Pink Pony,"My four year old granddaughter just loves her pony. We enjoyed playing the games, dressing her, and decorating her house. She really needed some help with the games, but we had a great time doing them together."
4,pony,This pony was sent to me on time and it was in great condition very durable. and the kids enjoy playing with the pink pony
3,Susanna's story about Salem,"The story is about a little girl named Susanna English who witnesses a circle of girls who are chanting what they want out of life, and acting like witches. A few days after she notices this because, the same girls cry out on people of the town of Salem. They accuse many of being witches and saying their spirits come and taunts them at night. This goes on for about two years, until Susanna comes forth and tells the people of Salem the truth about the girls. Over all, this book was not that bad. If you are looking for a fast read and something easy to understand, then this is your book. This is the first book I have read by Ann Rinaldi, and I hope it is not my last."
5,Good Book,"It's kind of sad that me a 16 year old would get a book for 9 - 12 but this book was great. I Didnt find it for 9-12 at all. I have been studing the salem witch trails for a long time. I Found this book to be truthful to the past. Anyone who likes to read abou witchs should pick this up though you might find it boring if you do not like the salem witch trail or the 1690's (which happen to be my faviorte time to read about)If you liked this you shoulf try reading WitchChild. But if you didnt and just picked it up because you like reading about witchs, ghost, try the circle of three by Isobel Bird. There are meany other great books out there. If you would like to talk about books/ wicca/ anything you may email or im bLACK cAT O02@aol.com anytime.Blessed B;Jennifer"
4,~*Pink's Review*~,"This book takes place in Salem, long ago when they were having trials on the trials of alleged witches. Susanna being the heroic person she was, was havin a hard time with this because she was in some part of the witch things. Although she wasnt a witch, she knew some things that could help out with a major problem there. I recommend this book to those who like stories about witches or something like it."
1,"Ding-Dong, the witch is dead, and so is this book","I found this book a bit boring. In the beginning, the book is a little slow, and then the adventure picks up, and then slows down again at the end. I also thought that the book was on the harder side; there are lots of characters to remember and some of them have the very similar names, so sometimes it can become just a little confusing. I would not recommend this book to others because it wasn't interesting and it wasn't a page-turner. Historical-fiction lovers would probably find this to be okay though."
2,Smelly Book,"This book saved me 50% off the new book price, but it wasn't worth it. The book was very musty smelling. I wont be buying used books again."
4,A Break With Charity,I thought this was going to be another boring school book. It wasnt it was really interesting!!! YOu cant read it 2 pages at a time you really need to focus and pay attention!!!! It was great!
1,"The Same Characters as ""The Crucible"" written in the 1950's","While a good read, for those who have read ""The crucible"" play by Arthur Miller may find it tough to delv too deep into this work. The character's names in this book have been taken from the play but re-arranged in the story plot. Ann Putnam is a teenage michief maker, Abbigail Williams is eleven years old, and the Proctors are nothing to be found.Overall a great literary work, but when trying to read a book after reading a play that says the complete opposite, it's hard to enjoy."
4,"A Break With Charity, Review by Christina Rizk","Susanna English, a fourteen year old girl who lives in the small puritan community of Salem, is torn betweeen two worlds as her family gets accused of witchcraft and is sent to prison.Susanna desperately wants to join the circle of the girls who meet at the parsonage every week, but what she doesn't know is that they're planning to make things interesting and sudddenly act ""afflicted"" by witches whom they accuse at random; and the magistrate's believe them. Susanna stays in Salem with the Putnams, as her family is in Boston, and soon falls in love with Jonathon Hathorne. Finally Susanna is faced with having to make the hardest desicision of her life: tell the people of the evil girls' plans and risk getting accused of a witch, or keep quiet and watch innocent people lose their lives for no good reason."
5,Perfect book when you are studying the Trials.,This is a perfect book for kids that love history. Ms. Ann is an amazing writer. Her writing makes you think that you in her book living during the time of the Salem Witch Trials.
4,Salem witch trials,"Historically dense telling of the events of the Salem Witch trials which introduces the reader to all of the main characters. Not the best written book in the world, but it does a heck of job of putting the reader into the time period"
4,Very Good,"The book was great. Very well written, if a little predictable because of the reknown of the story. Overall it was an interesting twist, and the author was careful to be true to historical facts as much as could be allowed. Very interesting and touching, definitely deals with the powers of ideas."
4,The confession,Susanna is a girl who is the only person that knows the truth and is the only person that can stop the witch maddness in Salem. Can she stop the group of girls well to find out read the book
3,Well Done!!!,"This book is good. I am 14 am VERY picky when it comes to books. So, my pretty good is most people's very good. I think it is pretty good. It is a guick read. I do, however really recomend The Fifth Of March more, but this book is nice"
3,"A war against evil in a place so ""good!!""","This book was recommended to me by a great reader,and I expected it to be a great book. I soon found out that her interests are somewhat different than mine. The book was written well, but it didn't make me feel the way I usually feel about a book. I usually can't put the book down and finish it two nights, yet this one just seemed to go on and on and on. Some parts were incredible and made me really think, but others didn't interest me and I had to skip a few pages. This book was overall really good, just not what I'd hoped it would be."
3,Gift,"given as a gift so i have no idea how well it works. can't say it's great, can't say it's bad. i have no reason to think that it wouldn't be a 5 star."
4,Worked well,I would have given five stars but the only reason i did not was because I would have preferred it having the option of less in a package. I only needed five not 12.
1,Rocket Ship,"Worst quality dvd I have ever viewed. The picture is quality isn't even as good as a vhs recording from tv.The color version is just recorded in b+w with a purple tint over the whole picture for a few minutes, thengreen tint, then yellow tint."
1,So let me get this straight...,"They took the FLASH GORDON serial, 13 chapters of non-stop laughs, thrills, sexy drama, and excitement, carved it down to featurette length, slashed the tops and bottom of the screen off to make it ""widescreen"", and then colorized it. And they're charging MONEY for it. Yes, they're asking you to PAY them to sit and look at garbage. Come to my house. I will let you look at my garbage for nothing. Well, okay, not the wastebasket in my bedroom. That's where I throw my torn underwear. Weirdo."
1,Rocket Ship,"BUYERS BEWARE: THIS IS A 2-DISC DVD-R RELEASE.The `In Amazing Malavision Color!' are just tinted scenes added to the original film and the film hasn't been`Digitally remastered' in any way that I can see if you already have a copy of the film. As for the Widescreen version, you can get the same effect if you play your full screen version in the zoom mode on your remote control on a 1.69:1 screen.I like this movie, but at the price listed, it's a total rip-off!"
5,excellent as usual,I bought this book for my mother and she said that this book was great. She loves James Patterson and he never lets her down. The book kept you on the edge of your seat and it had an unexpected ending. Totally worth the buy for all James Patterson fans and even great for those who have never read him before. She hasn't stopped raving since she put the book down.
2,Very disappointing,"I am a fan of James Patterson. Unfortunately I found this book a huge disappointment. Patterson is a talented writer but he seems to be in a ""money hunt"". That is, he is capitalizing on his success by churning out 3 - 5 books a year. Sadly, most of these are joint efforts, in which I suspect the secondary author writes the book and Patterson acts as editor. That would explain why the quality of his work is diminishing.I'd love to see 1 really well written novel a year from this author that is written by him alone. Beach Road is certainly not it. It is a completely mundane work with a weak plot and lacking in the usual Patterson suspense."
4,Great read.,"Loved this book. It,s a pretty quick read and has a very different ending. Likable characters and a great plot."
1,Cheat Road,"WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERWhen an author chooses a first-person narrative, he is obliged to be honest in expressing the character's thoughts. The author utterly ignored this rule, and in his need to create a plot twist, he created a profoundly disappointing book. I felt cheated."
2,Poor end,"I agree with most of the reviews here. While this book is very gripping, the end is a huge letdown. Reminded me of ""Murder of Roger Acroyd"" by Agatha Christie. The only difference is that Christie dropped a bunch of clues throughout the book about who the real murderer was, and the revelation in the last chapter really mads the book one of her best. In case of Beach Road, the end comes as absurd rather than surprising...."
1,Lame and shame on Patterson,"If this had been my first Patterson book I would have never wanted to read another. Waaaaaaaaaaay too many plot weaknesses, and the ending is insulting to readers trying to see where the book was going. Shame on Patterson."
3,Audio version is great!,"Despite the shortcomings of the plot, the audio version of the book is great! The voice acting is superb. The points of view of different characters are voiced by different actors, which makes it much easier to follow the story than reading it yourself. And I can understand the frustration of the other reviewers. Usually, when an author wants a plot twist at the end of the story, he/she would carefully mislead the reader by presenting the truth but only part of the truth, or misdirect them with a red herring, not misinform them and use the ""well the character was obviously lying"" excuse. However, what I found most incredulous about the plot was not who the real killer was, but that a supposedly super-intelligent ivy-leaguer lawyer does not seem to notice obvious clues that are displayed right in front of her eyes."
2,Fast Read,"I like most of the James Patterson books that I have read and I collect the Alex Cross Series because I enjoy them so much. This book had a shocking, unbelievable ending with a twist that blindsided me when it was revealed. It left me feeling sad that I had spent the day reading it and a little bit empty too. Not one that I would recommend."
3,Agatha Did It Better,"This book, like other Patterson novels, is a fast, easy read. I was enjoying it quite a bit, wondering how Tom & Kate would get an innocent Dante off and if they would find their way back together after all those wasted years. And then suddenly the book went to hell with an ending that ruined everything for me. All I can say is that Agatha Christie did it much better in one of her classic novels (I won't say which one so I don't spoil it). And at least Christie's protagonist had a much better motive and left you feeling some sympathy for him/her, which is not the case in this one. I wouldn't recommend this."
2,Eh...,Just finished the book and clearly this was not a typical Patterson novel. This was the first time I finished one of his books and felt disappointed. I kept having to refer back to the first page of each chapter to see who's voice I was reading. This is not the beach book of the summer. Pales in comparison to Lifeguard.
1,The surprise is unbelievable...in the worst possible way.,"I won't spoil the ""surprise"" twist, but will say that the reason it is a surprise is that it makes no sense. When a character speaks in first person throughout a book, then is suddenly cast in a totally different light, it feels like the author cheated.Love the Alex Cross books. Wish Mr. Patterson would focus his considerable talent there and stop with the cheap tricks."
1,Left A Bad Taste! Its a Waste!,"Sadly disappointing, this book is full of undeveloped charactors and the ending left a very bad taste in my mouth."
3,"Good book, bad ending","I loved this book up until it's twist ending. I don't want to give anything away, but I'll say that since it's written in first person the twist ending is confusing and unbelievable. Why didn't it come up sooner in the characters' thoughts? And the motive for the murder was absolutely unrealistic. The surprise ending is just there for the sake of surprise and nothing more."
1,Different Perspectives But All Dull,"I couldn't finish the book so I never got to the outlandish finish other reviewers commented on. As each character h took over a chapter and had their say I would think ""OK this character is dull but maybe the next one will be better"". No they don't get any better. It was a real chore just to give the book a fair chance before taking it back to the ship's library (I was on vacation). Thank God I didn't have to pay for this mess. Patterson has done some good ""junk books"" for beach reading or business trips but this isn't one of them. Stay away."
1,I'm Still mad,"Like another reviewer, this is my first review on Amazon. But this book made me so angry that I immediately sat down and wrote a blog entry titled ""Aaaahhhh!"" Guess it's a good thing that JP is such a bestseller, because otherwise NO editor would have allowed that ending. He jerked his readers around with this one. I'd burn it if I had a fireplace."
1,Awful...,Reads like a bad daytime soap opera. I left my copy in the pocket of the airline seat. Whoever finds it is welcome to it.
2,Not Impressed,"I don't usually care for James Patterson's stand-alone books, but since I enjoyed ""Honeymoon,"" I thought I'd give this one a try.All through the book I found it to be pretty boring -- it moved very slowly with really the same thing happening over and over. Then some small thing would happen which served no real purpose to further the book and which was really never explained and we'd go right back to Tom and Kate working on the case.The ending was a surprise but unbelievable. And after it was sprung on us, it seemed to go on way too long until it was finally wrapped up.In the future, I'll stick to the series."
2,a comic strip without the drawings,"I picked this up at the airport and stopped reading after 100 pages. Each chapterette is about 2 pages long, and the book reads like a series of comic strips. It's a page turner in the sense that you have to turn the page to find out what happens in the next strip. I might have stuck with it if there had been drawings to look at, but the writing itself doesn't hold much interest.I think the author(s) have relied too heavily on a formula for contemporary novel writing...using rules about words/sentence, actions/page, twists/book. Reading a book ABOUT the formula (e.g., The writer's little helper by James Smith, Jr.) is so much more interesting than reading a book so blatantly structured USING the formula."
2,Bad Ending,"Just finished Beach Road. I usually like James Patterson, but this book left a lot to be desired. It is like he did not know how to finish the book, so he just slapped together a ""twisted"" ending. It did not make sense when compared with the storyline. I was disappointed and somehow felt cheated. The main story was good, but the last few chapters belonged in a totally different book. It could have been so much better."
1,Booooo!,"What a disappointment! Strange for James Patterson to release such an amateurish book. There were very unrealistic ridiculous scenes with real life characters and that should have been the first sign but I kept going. Then the twist comes and it's just completely unrealistic and out of left field, completely unbelievable. Suspension of disbelief is gone in an instant and it's all been a waste. What a drag!"
1,don't waste your time,I love Patterson's books... this one does not hold up on any level. I was anxious to be finished because the characters were so shallow. Then the only one who seemed fleshed out and likable turns out to be unspeakably evil in the last few pages.A cynical and amateurish plot twist... all in all very disappointing.
1,Do you waste your time or money,"The story doesn't make a lick of sense. A lot of 2-page chapters which seem to be his thing. Writing is bad. Oh, no, it's not just the ending. The whole book sucks."
5,Betcha can't put it down!,"I have read every book by James Patterson. Beach Road is by far, the most exciting, mystfing, wonderful, twisted pieces of literature ever. I read it in a day 1/2. And I went to work in between. :) I tried within a day to pick up another ""new best seller"" from another of my favorite authors, but could not get into it at all. I was still on BEACH ROAD!Debbie"
1,Very disappointing,"This light-weight book definitely qualifies as a ""beach"" read. You can zip through it in no time and when you get to the end you'll wonder why you wasted your time. The ending is so off-the-wall it spoils what little appeal the book had. I'm all for plot twists but they should at least be believable. This one wasn't."
1,Wait for the paperback...,"After seeing all of the commercials tempting the wonderous twist to the ending, I purchased this book for a summer read. I had completed it in two sittings. To say the least, I had expected much more from such a well-known author. I found the changing points-of-view to be rather tiresome. As an elementary teacher, I found this book to have less than developed characters, and I was not impressed with the word choice of the writers. To be honest, I have read more developed, creative pieces from my sixth grade students. Overall, I was left disappointed and rather miffed that I had waisted two afternoons reading this book. If you have to spend several hours on a plane or stuck in the airport, it might be worth checking out from the library. I certainly would suggest spending money on it."
1,Terrible,"Pulp fiction is what it is, a fun, cheap escape. It's cotton candy for the soul and something many of us can use every now and then. Patterson and De Jonge use their craft and deliver a cheaply fun read, then ruin it with the ending. Of all the arbitrary plot twists, this one takes the blue ribbon. Patterson and his co-author devote an entire book to developing the protagonist--Tom Dunleavy. We get to know his character and personality. At the end, the authors turn on a dime, take away every single thing they've told us about Dunleavy and expect the reader to be gleeful, or at least sensationally scandalized, with this ""brilliant"" turn events. Even without the disastrous ending the book was mediocre escapism--with it, it's a slap in the face. You have better things to do with your time."
2,"SECOND RATE PLOT, AND HO-HUM CHARACTERS","I love Patterson's Alex Cross series, who doesn't, he is a master at the game of psychological suspense. Beach Road did absolutely nothing for me. When an author finds his niche, why does he have to turn a twist and venture off in another direction?In Beach Road the character of Tom Dunleavy just didn't jibe with me. Professional basketball player turned attorney - give me a break. Dante Halleyvale, the young upcoming basketball star is tried for murder and Tom comes to the rescue. Then, throw in Kate Costello, the young attorney whose heart Tom has already broken, but she is back for round two and willing to give the relationship another whirl. The characters were weak, the plot just average.James Patterson has won our hearts with Alex Cross, please stick with what you do best and give us more of him and less of this drivel. No offense, but I have come to learn that every time I see the name Peter de Jonge on the cover, the book will be a waste of money."
1,God-Awful,James Patterson is just signing his name to these books so they will sell. Does he even write anymore?
1,Puerile,"Fess up now, whose high school class wrote it? Beach Road reads like it was written by kids in a hurry for an audience of their peers. The characters are tinfoil thin, the plot is downright ridiculous.I read another Patterson novel right before this one: Along Came a Spider, published in 1993. And while it had many small flaws, that book at least had richly textured characters, plenty of atmosphere, and an interesting plot. So I know Patterson (& Co.) can write. Or could write. It seems downright cynical to crank out an inferior product like Beach Road just because your devoted fans will buy anything with your name on it. But not forever."
2,Not so well thought out,"I was enjoying this book until it got towards the end. Without giving anything away, I felt the ending was sudden and completely unpredictable. While this can be good, looking back, there were no indications that the final resolution might have been a possiblity - it seemed somewhat far-fetched and not very well thought out. I felt that the final resolution was much like the work we tend to do as youngsters ... working hard to do a good job, but then dropping the buck at the end because we are sick and tired of the task. All in all, I was disappointed in the book. I would not recommend this read to any of my friends."
1,Disappointing Fluff,"Patterson writes great books and commercial fluff--nothing in between. This is not a good effort. I had to force myself to finish it, and the usual plot twists and surprises seemed contrived."
2,Falling Off the Cliff,"This book sails along fine through the verdict on a murder case about 85% into the book. Then bango, there's a plot twist that is completely implausible. I don't ever remember being so angry at a mangled plot twist like this one."
1,Beach (Dirt) Road,"I'm a real fan of the Alex Cross series, but this novel was a huge disappointment on all levels. I will say that it had a pretty good twist, but it was overall such a negative experience that I will probably not buy Patterson any more. On the other hand, if you think all males are redneck, racist, sexist scum, you'll probably breathlessly lap this up."
3,Say What?,"It seems as though most of the reviews here expressed disappointment at the ending of this book. In a way, I suppose, that's the point. No one saw this coming, not the readers or the characters in the story. The thing is, in light of who the killer turns out to be, the murders just don't make sense. I don't want to give away the ending here, so I will say no more, but a good twist only works if it makes sense. This one doesn't. Still, I enjoyed the story up until the end."
2,Not one of Patterson's better novels,"This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up."
2,Nope ... not this time,"I used to be the first to buy Patterson. But, this ""team"" writing just doesn't work for me. Too bad, too. I liked Patterson a lot."
3,What a disappointing ending!,"Read this book and you will feel cheated by the ending!This was a great, easy, summer read. But the ending stunk, so be prepared for it."
2,Publishers Weekly - I'm with you!,"Maybe we can blame this one on Peter de Jonge - because I didn't like the ""The Beach House"", either. I thought the characters were thinly drawn - and I really couldn't get close enough to them to care much about them. And, I felt strongly that the story took place in an entirely wrong setting. It was like staging West Side Story in West Palm Beach.Despite the above, I am a huge James Patterson fan, own all his hardcovers, and salivate when I hear a new one is coming out. Rarely does he let me down. But, this time, I have to agree with Publisher's Weekly - this one was thrown together in time for the ""beach reading"" season - and even though there is an ""aha"" twist at the end, by the time you get there, you don't really give a darn."
2,So-so,"Not Patterson's best by a long shot. The character development was seriously lacking, and the identity of the killer was not only a shocker, but a disappointment. You are not really given the tools with which to learn to care about these characters, and all the different voices are a tad confusing."
4,different but good,Beach Road seemed very different to me from other Patterson books. It was told from the point of view of several of the characters. It was a quick read and the ending knocked my socks off!
2,One of the Worst Patterson Novels,"I am finding a pattern here that whenever Patterson co-writes his books (which he is doing more and more) they come out terrible. I have been such a huge fan of his for years now, but this may be the last Patterson book for me. There is no suspense anymore and I am finding his books and his endings extremely predictable, and utterly unbelievable at that. Where did the old James Patterson go!!"
3,Stuck in the middle,"First of all I love James Patterson's works. I am a long time fan. I was however disappointed with Beach Road. It seemed rushed, unfinished. Tom was a great character, as was Kate, but the normal development and commitment to characters that I expect from JP was not there. I feel cheated! It just didn't flow, and I found myself having to look back at the beginning of a chapter to see which character was speaking. I have never had to do that with any of his other books. Lastly, I am african american, some of the descriptions were just unrealistic. In this day and age what black women would allow herself to be called Mammy, no matter how trifiling she was."
4,Wow,"As the book jacket reads, this book will leave you gasping with shock! In typical Patterson fashion, this is a fast, exciting read with short chapters and lots of action. I read it in two days, trying to figure out the end before I got there. Never happened! As another reviewer wrote, it leaves you a little angry, a little disappointed. It's worth the read though, cause you'll never see it coming!"
1,Beach Road,"Never read James Patterson and never plan to again. This would make a good Hollywood B movie but if you're looking for good writing and a good storyline, look elsewhere. If you must read it, borrow it from the library because it's not worth the money."
2,Aaaaaaaaaand Flop.,"I have to say, I was so excited for a new summer Patterson read. I scooped it up, tore into it, loving the feeling of familiar with the style, short chapters, different voices, loving it. There was, however, an unsettling feeling throughout this book, that I hadn't felt before. Come to the end of the book, and I now I know it's my subconcious telling me to RUN DUMMY, RUN. The ending was. . . . just distasteful. The book was better, deserved better that that. So. Here I am, with a book I've been so excited to share with my friends this summer and all I have to say is FLOP. To each their own. I still love the writer but this one seemed rushed, flimsy. Next time you throw us a bone, give us some meat, eh?"
1,It was awful,"I had a freshman English professor many years ago. I wrote what I thought was a good short story. It came back with a C+ and the comment 'I do not like surprise endings'. This book is much worse than my short story, and my English professor would have given it a F. So do I."
1,Shock ending all right...,I was totally dissapointed in this read! I didn't much like the very short chapters...and the ending was unbelieveably BAD. I agree with another reviewer...don't waist your money...if you MUST read another James Patterson book...borrow this one!!!
1,Long time reader - truly terrible!,"I've been a long time reader of James Patterson and usually do not buy his books when he's co-authoring them with someone else. After reading ""The Fifth Horsemen,"" which was great, I decided to try his book with Peter de Jonge.This has to be one of the worst books I've ever read. Did James Patterson have anything to do with this book or did he just lend his name to Peter de Jonge's book? This book was a complete waste of time and money. After reading some decent books with him and Maxine Paetro I thought I'd give this one a try.Truth told I couldn't even finish the book it was so bad. I read the last chapter and that was enough to ruin the experience for me. I've been reading Patterson's work since they first came out and I have to say that I'm skeptical about reading any more of his works in the future. I'm also tempted to contact the publisher about this book, over hyped and for nothing.A shame but truly terrible, deserves no stars."
1,TOTALLY SUCKED!!!,This had the worst gimmick of an ending I have ever experienced. Any half-baked writer would not have stooped so low. I may not ever pick up another James Patterson novel again. I wonder which one of these two geniuses came up with it...and did they have to get the other one drunk to go along with it?DO NOT...I REPEAT...DO NOT INVEST YOUR GOOD READING TIME OR YOUR EMOTIONS ON THIS PIECE OF WORTHLESS RAT DOO.
1,Paper is worth pennies but don't wast 3.99 mailing for a used one,"This was a super quick read, and an utter waste of time. Very disappointing and probably my last James Patterson/Peter DeJonge. There is so much out there worth reading and time is precious; learned my lesson!"
1,A few random thoughts....,"First, there's a reason some authors like Twain and Tolstoy are taught in classic lit courses and authors like Patterson are found on bookshelves at airports. Second, my only thought upon finishing this book was, ""There's about three hours of my life I'll never get back."" Third, the ending was not, as some say, ""stunning"". Quite simply it was stupid. Absolutely unconnected with anything in the book which preceded it. Turned an already weak book into a horrible one. Fourth, I picked this book up at a thrift store for 25 cents. I overpaid. Lastly, if this book is indicative of his other books how does this guy continue to get published? More importantly, why do we as readers continue to buy his books?"
1,Dissapointing,I'm a big fan of James Patterson and I couldn't believe this was a piece of his work. It read like a cheap paperback novel. I haven't given up on Patterson. He's sill a great author.
2,WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED!,I love every James Patterson book I have ever read. I just finished this book 10mins ago. I feel like throwing up!Shocking suprize OK.... A very disapointing ending!So looking back 8 months later. This may have been to harsh. But this book still left a terrible feeling in my stomach. Not the usual Patterson satisfaction... If I could change it I might give it a 3 star for shock effect!
2,Beach Bust,"Like many other Patterson readers, ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls"" are among my favorite detective/crime novels. However, ""Beach Road"" falls far short of expectations.You can always expect a twist at the end with Patterson novels, and ""Beach Road"" is no exception. Perhaps he's exhausted his creative talents, but the twist in this novel is completely expected, and the 300+ pages that come before make the ""surprise"" hardly worth it.Among other flaws, the dialogue in ""Beach Road"" is just painful. Nearly every spoken interaction in the novel had me squirming in awkwardness. Patterson may be a good story teller, but he fails miserably when it comes to interaction between characters.While not a complete waste, I most definitely would not recommend ""Beach Road."" Instead, read some of Patterson's earlier work, or read other detective/crime novels by authors such as Jeffery Deaver."
3,"ouch, the ending is painful!","Loved this book, loved how it flowed. I was able to read it quickly, and really enjoyed it...until the end. Save yourself from the ending, just read the book until they reach a verdict. After the verdict is given STOP READING! You will enjoy the book so much more, the ending is so far fetched and unbelievable.I'm mad at James Patterson for doing this to me...I love all his other books so much!!"
2,"Fun, But a Cheap Ending","The book starts out well, it's a little fluffy(But it's a beach book, so that's okay) but it's fast paced with likable characters. The end is just Wrong! Several times Agatha Christie pulled a real shocker of an ending, but she always played fair and left plenty of clues. This book didn't do that. The ending feels as if it were just tacked on in an effort to shock us, and it comes completely out of the blue. Very unfair. The character of Macklin is also rather puzzling . Even the last page feels rushed. A fun book ruined by a cheap ending."
1,Not that great...,"Beach Road by James Patterson is a typical thriller/mystery novel. Tom Dunleavy is an East Hampton local and a former NBA star turned unmotivated, mediocre lawyer. When three savage murders occur in East Hampton, Dante Haleyville, a local black teen is charged with the crimes. Tom agrees to take Dante's case, investigates it and tries it, with the help of top Manhatten lawyer, Kate Costello.This book was a very quick read - I read it in one day in between concerts. It's a typical Patterson thriller - short chapters, told from many different perspectives. It's pretty shallow, albeit in an entertaining way. The ploys and twists used by Mr. Patterson were nothing new for him or for other authors, and it was somewhat predictable. It's a beach read and nothing that will challenge how you think about yourself, the world or anything in it. I would stick to the Alex Cross series if I were picking up a Patterson novel."
5,I loved this book!,"I usually pride myself on being able to figure out the ""culprit"" before the end of the book; I was quite surprised!I personally like that James Patterson writes short chapters because I can put the book down at the end of a chapter.....or if I want to read a little more, the next chapter won't be very long either.I've passed this book along to friends and they were as surprised as I was at the ending."
1,drivel,"Why did they waste paper for this novel...though there must be better term for these substandard outpourings....""spiritless life-sapped"" paint by the numbers plot outlines?""It's like a poor version of verbal hip-hop...you just keep moving fast..and changing the scene...what is the point? There's no heart...no engagement....cardboard characters...sophomoric over-the-top histronics. This should be labelled pablum for the grammar school set or mentally challenged adults.Patterson should go back to his old day job...but why should he when this ""hip-hop"" verbiage is making him rich?He's like an older version of ""Paris Hilton""...garish, over-the-top"" childlike, all flash, no substance...but at least she has an excuse..at his age, Patterson should know better....And who wrote the rave reviews...his ""buds""?? Patterson wonders why books are a distant third or fourth in the entertainment hierarchy....Look no further."
2,Written by Committee,"Patterson coauthored this book with Peter DeJonge. I was really disappointed. It is evident that two people wrote it. The ending is a complete disconnect from the rest of the book. It is supposed to be a surprise ending, but it looks like one person started the novel and another finished it. It isn't worth the hardcover price."
4,ALSO DISAPPOINTED,"THE ENDING CAME FROM LEFT FIELD, DID NOT SEE IT COMING. I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE FIRST TWO THIRDS OF THE STORY. VERY DISJOINTED AND CHOPPY AND NOT VERY INTERESTING. SEEMED TO SKIM OVER HIS CHARACTERS, LIKE A CONDENCED VERSION.I AM HUGE FAN OF JAMES PATTERSON AND HAVE READ EVERY BOOK OF HIS. I TRULY ENJOY HIS SHORT, QUICK TO THE POINT CHAPTERS. THIS WAS NOT UP TO HIS USUAL PAR. I FELT CHEATED AFTER FINISHING IT. LIKE, WHY DID HE BOTHER. KNOW IT WAS NOT FOR THE MONEY BUT THAT IS WHAT IT REMINED ME OF, DID IT FOR SPENDING CASH.WITH THAT SAID I HAVE PRE-ORDERED HIS NEXT TWO BOOKS. STILL A HUGH FAN..."
4,Beach Road,I enjoyed this book with its twist and turns and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys mysteries. It is a different James Patterson than the Alex Cross that many of us have wrongly come to expect.
2,Hmmm,"Not my favorite Patterson book. I did not keep this one in my collection but shared it. You, however, may love it."
3,Beach Road,"As a huge James Patterson fan, I was disappointed that it took me some time to get into the story. This is the first of his books that I put down and came back to several times. His books tend to grab me on the first chapter and I can't put the book down until I've completed it. So, although this was not one of his best reading adventures, as usual, Mr. Patterson never disappoints on his endings."
1,"Not a bad read, ruined by an awful ending.","After reading a James Patterson book several years ago, I swore I'd never buy another one of his books. I picked this one up at the airport and didn't realize who wrote it until I was on the airplane. I was thoroughly enjoying the book until the ending. I love plot twists, but they need to make at least a little sense. The ending to Beach Road didn't fit with anything that came before it and it was truly unbelievable. I will NEVER buy another James Patterson book."
3,not one of his best,"I have to agree with those who didn't care for this book. You could tell the different writing styles between Patterson and the other guy. The ending was a twist, but also kind of predicting..(I had a feeling of who it might of been but wasn't too sure. I was right) I also thought there was also unanswered questions and just some chapters that were in there that really were meaningless. The ending could of been better."
5,Beach Road,"The book arrived earlier than expected and in perfect condition. The book was better to read than expected, also!"
1,Audio Book - Too pretentious for listening,"I do a lot of driving and I enjoy listening to audio books. I could barely listen to two disks of this book. The strange voice providing the chapter number, title and silly music destroyed the book for me. I neither know, nor care, how the rest of the book progresses."
1,Simply awful....,"I purchased this book a while ago and for some reason, never read it. My Kindle seems to be on the fritz, so I've been scrounging around for some reading material. I picked this up and wondered why I never pursued it when I bought it. I guess I read the jacket and wasn't impressed or just had too many other books I wanted to read first.At any rate, it was simply awful. The ""twist"" was so bad - and the whole concept of the novel just SO poor, SO unremarkably predictable - it was hard to get through. I was bound and determined to read it though, and I did. I hated the short chapters, the writing style and the whole name-dropping, ""star studded"", pretentious dialogue.Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this - I'm sending my copy off to the Goodwill. No more of these for me. There are FAR, FAR better writers out there and publishers just keep churning out this drivel and taking away from a writer who DESERVES to have works published!"
1,Beach Road,"I was so unhappy with the ending that I threw this book in the trash and I am a person who recycles everything. I felt betrayed, disappointed, and found the story implausible."
1,What has happened to James Patterson?,"This writer has a history of publishing interesting page-turners. Beach Road has the appearance of having been slapped together over a long weekend.After the first 10 chapters of the 117 chapters (yes, 117 in 362 pages), I had to force myself to complete it to see if I could find the old Patterson. I didn't. He (Patterson or de Jonge?)used the chapter headings to shift points of view...this was apparently done to avoid the more arduous techniques of careful writing. This made it clumsy to read, since the reader may have to check back to know who is speaking.If you love Patterson, don't waste time or money on this novel"
4,Fun and entertaining although NOT the best storyline...,"I enjoyed the way the book was written by the viewpoint of several characters, and the ""narrator"" at the beginnig of the book warned the reader that ""people lie"". That fact alone kept me very interested in the book all the way through. I found myself listening to what every character had to say during their ""chapters."" In this respect, the book was fun, engaging and suspenseful.However, when I finished the book, I felt I had more questions than answers and my need to know far outweighs my need to read, so I am actually in the process of re-reading the book to try to make some sense out of it. During this second pass, I can now realize how weak some of the statements made are and how the plot line lacks credibility.But, if you can handle reading a book and moving on - this one will at the very least entertain you while you are reading it."
2,Did not finish it,I like the Alex Cross serie and love the Women's Murder Club series but I could not finish this one.I personally do not recommend it.
1,"""LAME, LAME, LAME""","I was so disappointed with my first James Patterson book that I doubt I will spend any more time on his books. I'm not normally a fan of light ""beach"" books, but I had seen the book at the library and thought I'd give him a try. It was OK, a quick read, but I was so disturbed by the way he ended it, I thought, ""Why did I waste my time"" when I had so many other books waiting to be read. Don't waste your time!!"
3,okkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk,Didn't think this was one of Patterson's best books...You know who the killer is before the ending...Wasn't a surprise...
3,Politics,James Patterson has started putting his politics in his stories.I read his books for recreation not for his polictical views. Please keep your politics out of the books.
1,Terrible Disappointment,Not up to Patterson's standard. Lots of holes and i could find nothing in the story to support the ending. D-
1,Poorly written; poorly read fromat.,"Books should draw your attention; pulling you in from the world, into the fiction generated by the author.This book doesn't do that at all. You have to concentrate like you did in Western Civ. class. From the abundance of 'page filling prose' so the book will be longer than 10 pages, to the many readers assigned to read this book. It's just BAD!!I like a man and a women reading so they can gender-specific the read. This book has like 5 readers and yet a woman reads a man's character. Why? It seems more like a reader relay going on.I have read Patterson and liked him, but he must only be placing his name on this book, or he has lost his touch."
5,loved it,"I really enjoyed this book. I have been a little disappointed in Patterson's latest books, but this was better. It did start to drag a little toward the end (before the dramatic twist) but that may be because I read it in two sittings and I was getting tired.I would suggest this book to anyone."
1,Pull-ease,"I'm with the reviewers who thought this book was ruined by the ending. I'm all for twists, but this was completely ridiculous and incongruous and dumb.The book tells the tale of Hamptons small-time lawyer Tom, who had a brief career as a professional ball player. Apparently sometime in his youth, he dumped the woman he truly loved, Kate, who became a hard career lawyer in NYC. We know she's hard because she smokes, and has no friends, but in the end, they band together and find true love while defending a young black ball player from a multiple murder death-penalty charge.It's twisting and turning and super derivative, but mostly it's satisfying. Until the last few chapters, when the writers throw in a major monkey wrench that turns the books into a joke.I felt as if the entire reading experience was false, and a waste of time. Badly done. Cheap.Patterson's books may not be the best, but they ususally don't make you feel this cheated."
1,Worst ending I ever read,"I was actually enjoying this book until the ending. Not great literature, but a passable summer read until the end. I can't understand how it got any good reviews at all. I'm certain we'll never have to suffer a movie version because NO ONE would buy this story."
3,Disappointing end!,"I have been a fan of James Patterson books for a long time. I was looking forward to reading this book. I found the book enjoyable until the ending. I don't understand why he would choose to end the book this way. What a huge disappointment from an otherwise okay book. I guess, as advertised, I was shocked by the ending but not in the way that was intended."
2,disappointment +++,"I've enjoyed Patterson's books - especially the Alex Cross novels. I was thoroughly enjoying this one until the ending where I became so angry that I couldn't sleep!! Was this his idea of being ""artistic?"" I will be VERY careful before I pick up another Patterson book."
3,Not the Beach House,Slow-going but held my interest. Unusual format in that chapter title indicated person speaking. Shocking twist at the end.
2,Disappointing -,It seems each of the great thriller authors eventually produces a bomb. This is it for Patterson. All new characters without the depth i have come to expect. I would have trashed it by page 50 were it any other author. By page 90 it slowly began to pick up a bit but I only continued because it was Patterson. Wondering how much of it he actually wrote. Not up to expectations.
3,It's just okay!,"Three men are shot and killed in the Hamptons. Dante Halleyville, a talented basketball player who decided to go to college instead of heading straight to the NBA after high school, is the prime suspect.Friend and defense attorney Tom Dunleavy is one of the people who are trying to figure out what happened that night. He convinces Dante to turn himself in only to realize Dante is already guilty in the minds of most residents of this elite community, including the police. Tom recruits his former girlfriend Kate Costello, also a lawyer, to help him clear Dante in the Trial of the Century.Every few chapters the point of view shifts to another character, giving us yet another person's view of the situation. This left me feeling a little confused. I also never managed to feel any empathy toward any of the characters. I don't think this is one of Patterson's best.Armchair Interviews says: Recommended for Patterson fans, but others may want to try one of his other books."
2,Unbelievable,"After fifteen or so Patterson books, this one is a big disappointment. I didn't care for the format, and the ending is simply unbelievable - and I don't mean that in a possitive way.I prefer Patterson's solo efforts."
3,Beach Road-middle of the road,"I found it annoying that the book was told from various characters' points of view. This format added nothing of value to the book. However, I agree with another reviewer who said that the book was slow, but it kept their interest. Since I always finish books I start, I kept at this one, and it finally got interesting about mid-way through. The ending was definitely shocking and more worthy of Patterson than the rest of the book. An ok read, but not as good as the Beach House. Before this, I read the 5th Horseman, which was much better."
3,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"Three young men are murdered on a beach near a movie star's mansion in mega-bucks East Hampton. Dante Halleyville is accused of the murders and asks Tom Dunleavy, a year-round resident and attorney, to represent him. Tom seeks help from a long-ago love, Kate Costello. Most of the story revolves around the trial and assorted sub-plots. And, of course, who really killed the three men.I'm a long-time James Patterson fan; and like all his books, this is a quick, surprising read with a shocking end (although I did figure out one of the bad guys). But I wasn't nuts about this new writing technique of each chapter from a different character's viewpoint."
4,Interesting and devilish!,"Oh yeah, Patterson keeps you going all the way to the end! He's a master of deceiving you into thinking who the real culprit is...but wait....and then comes the shock. This was not one of Patterson's greatest, but it was a fun ride via audio tape and I enjoyed it. Patterson has a great writer's mind and always keeps me entertained! This book was no different."
3,Solid Research - Excellent Background Information,"Reading this book will require some patience. If you have trouble with the first chapter, move on to chapter 2. You may not agree totally with the author, but it will have to be admitted that there is a background of experience and research that is driving the effort.The author also brings a unique combination of knowledage about the subject."
1,An Ideological book about a clash of ideologies,"I give it one star because fewer stars are unavailable. This is a book that seeks to denigrate Islam written by an author that is best described as a crackpot. It pretends to be researched, but it is based primarily on bigotry."
5,Unlikely Teachers: Finding the Hidden Gifts in Daily Conflict,"Most people attack in times of conflict. This book advises the opposite: Instead of taking a step into the fray, take a step backwards and give yourself a minute to think before you jump in. You will find you actually learn something about the other person and, more valuable to your learning, you gain insight into your own motivations and attitudes. Thus the other individual in the conflict becomes an ""Unlikely Teacher."""
5,Worth Every Page.,I found the book to be very useful in many business situations. My success in business depends on building relationships and I have benefited from the ideas presented in Judy's book. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to turn negatives into positives and lead a more productive and healthy life.
5,"Mandy, I Wanna Be With You","I wanted this CD after watching numerous MTV commercials for the movie, Centerstage. I had to have ""I Wanna Be With You."" I have been listening to it non-stop ever since. I have it on repeat, ""I Wanna Be With You."" Mandy's new songs on this album are also excellent. Notably, 3/Want You Back and 11/Your Face. Some of her old songs also appear, such as 7/Walk Me Home and 9/So Real. Although I don't prefer the Candy and So Real remixes, they are still ok. Buy this CD, I'm going to go listen to mine now."
1,A bad cd from a mediocre artist,"Mandy moore is okay, nobody can tell me she is some amazing artist with a beautiful voice. But they gave her really stupid songs too. The slow songs are just wierd and poorly written. the fast songs are also bad, especially the new remixes."
1,what a waste of money,"The only reason why I bought this CD is because I liked the song ""I wanna be with you"", but the more I listen to it the more I get sick of it. In a way I almost feel sorry for Mandy. I mean Sony is obviously exploting her to get in to the teen pop market. Get Christina Aguilera's CD instead, its so much better."
4,Moore of Mandy!,omg i just have to say i think mandy is so cute!And even being a girl im not afraid of saying it!Her music is really great too!I really like the sweet ballad of Walk me home.It's so sweet!Her voice is really great even though its really pop too!I definately recommend her!Keep singin Mandy!~Marie~
5,Mandy Moore:I Wanna Be With You!,"Well, if you're looking for a hot CD, this is the one to get! Candy is amazing, & I Wanna Be With You is perfect.The other songs are great too.Check my song rating & see if its your match:1.I Wanna Be With You:This song is my favorite! It'll get stuck in your head before you know it! A REAL music hit! Rated:5/52.Candy:Excellent song, great beat to it.This is another favorite of mine! Rated:5/5Those ratings were only for 2 songs.I just wanted to get it straight for you, but the one thing to remember is:Please buy this CD! It is a true hit of music songs that can enspire the whole family!"
5,I wanna be with you!,"I Loved the song ""I wanna be with you"" It is such a sweet song..it explains how i feel about my boyfriend! Thanx ~sydney Gribble"
4,soulful,I like this album because it's mature and her words are powerful. They appeal to the way you're ever felt or feeling about someone when you were a teenager. I recommend it for everyone out there who's got a crush and don't know how to reveal it to that person.
2,"If you already have the first cd, don't buy this one.","I am a big fan of Mandy's and have both of her cd's. But I must say, her last cd, I Wanna Be With You, was very disapointing. Out of twelve, there are five new songs on this cd, not including one remix. So Real, Lock Me In your Heart, Walk me home, I like It, Candy-they are all the same exact recordings as on the first album. Then she puts a remix of Candy on here too. It's my fault; I bought the cd without even looking at the songs on the back. If, however, you don't have her first one, I recommend this cd because it has about half of the ones on So Real."
1,sad...,this is the saddest cd i have ever heard. no good songs except for #2. that's the only good song on the album. i thought her debut album was better.
1,Pointless..bad singing,"If you like I Wanna be with you (the song) get it from Napster. The only reason they made this CD is casue Mandy was loosing poplarity and they wanted to bring her back. Te new songs are really corny and stupid, and they got lots of bad songs off her old album too. Bad CD and such horrible singing. She sounds brety and computer enhanced."
1,Mandy Moore who,Mandy Moore who is ecxactly what i am saying this cd shouldnt sell they shold give it away for free in fact ill pay for it not to exist. her songs were just trash just like her she should be ashamed of herself for even appearing in public with these stupid songs that a little girl write in kindergarden Man im just so sick of her really its not worth buying it not even if it was a dollar
1,Don't waste your money,"Yes, the title track is a good song. Everything else is just trash from her old CD. The remix is bad and all the new stuff is really lame too. Download the song if you want, but the CD is a waste of money!"
2,Mandy's 2nd CD is so-so,"The only good song is ""I Wanna Be With You"". All of the other songs are bad. Don't waste your money."
2,she's soo really ok,"mandy moore is just another teen queen pop singer. i don't like her voice. it sounds like a 12 year old star search contestant. i like her songs even less. i hate britney, but i have to admit, britney's songs are better. mandy, maybe you should get better song writers, i think it would make you sound better. but i do like the 4 new songs better. they are actually the only songs of hers that i like. candy is a good song. one of the few. i really don't like the remixes, or for that matter the whole cd."
3,"I Wanna Be With Her, not her songwriters!","Mandy Moore has a good voice which has been ruined by 550 Music, which is incidentally Celine Dion's label. After her first album, I expected more than 5 new songs from Mandy. To put it nicely, Wade Robson doesn't deserve a dime for the remixes, because they stink! Mandy does a jaw-dropping job on ""I Wanna Be With You"" and ""Your Face"". I hope on her next CD she has better songs, because she could very well go a long way. If you want the real Mandy Moore, go get her debut. You'll value it more because of the material!"
5,"A Sweet, Nice Album","Mandy Moore changes her style of dance in most of these songs. Some of the songs in here are just remixes of her other songs found in the first album. The new ones have more strings and percussion that sound more like Natalie Imbruglia's songs, but it still is a wonderful cd. It's new ones sound sweet, and romantic. Mandy is young and talented, with a great singing voice that will take her further in the music business."
2,Very lackluster and clumsily put together,"I like a few of these songs on her album, but only a few. IWBWY is sweet, but doesn't stand out as being a memorable tune (unlike Oops I did it again). Mandy may have a few fans, but the fact remains that she has no staying power and is already fading from the pop scene. This album is an attempt to save her, but it fails miserably. She doesn't have the talent, style, dance moves or charm of Britney Spears, nor the voice of Christina or Jessica. Sorry Mandy but you have nothing new to offer!"
3,a good cd to listen to...,"when mandy moore first started with her song ""candy"", i liked her voice and that song.. but i never bought her cd.. and then when center stage was advertised.. i heard ""i wanna be with you"".. and think that song sounds beautiful.. the back round music is pretty to hear.. and then i heard the remix of this song.. so i decided to buy her new cd.. and i like it overall.. there are some remixes.. like ""candy"" and i like the ""i wanna be with you"" remix.. even though i am not a mandy moore fan, i do like her new cd"
1,WHY?,"Give me a break already...What is she trying to prove...Her voice well you can tell she is 15 or 16..Young anyway..Not a mature voice, too needy...Trying too hard...The song has faded already so why the new cd... with a repeat of songs from her first album...Money hungry? Didn't she just come out? Stop trying so hard, Mandy! Stop pulling a Britney, if you want to get out of her shadow get out of the business..."
4,Promising,"Although Mandy Moore's voice still lacks the depth and volume compared to her contemporaries, her efforts are slowly being noticed. ""I Wanna Be With You"" is getting much attention and airplay here. I think people are noticing that she chooses her songs carefully. Her climb to popularity is slow but sure, and it is indeed better than all-out hard-sell promotions. One other song that's getting a lot of requests over the radio is ""Walk Me Home"".Good work, Mandy!"
5,mandy moore is fine,songs are ok i have nothing against her but if you want this album get judge it for your self but Mandy Moore is the most finest girl ever she looks good in all of her video candy looks real finer walk me home finr than ever wanna be with you lookin finer than ever Mandy Moore is the most finest girl i ever seen if your mandy moore or know her email me at and2999@aol.com
4,I Wanna Be With You,"This album is so moving and touching. When I first saw it, I was like ok. But, this album is truly moving and each word has a meaning. I f you hear it, you will never want to stop playing these songs.This is also a great buy!"
3,Remixes,There are a bunch a remix coupled witha few weak attemps at some new songs. it does however contain I Wanna Be With You the soundtrack smash from Center Stage. But save your money and buy that CD there are better selections on it. I am a Mandy fan but this CD was a waste. Do howeer get her new CD Mandy which incs In My Pocket and Crush!
4,great CD,"This is a great collection of songs. Mandy Moore definately has a great voice. But my favorite part of this CD was the Wade Robson re mixes. (just to clear up who Wade Robson is, he's a teenager, he's about 18 years old, who choreographs dance routines and music videos such as Nsync's Pop, he also wrote that song too, Britney Spears' Crazy and many many more)Anyways the remixes are awesome, different and full of energy. Her other songs are great too but they're lacking something, I still haven't quite put my finger on it yet."
5,I Wanna Be With Mandy!!!!!,"This Album Is Amazing, With Good Beats And Lyrics, I Love The Remix's It Has, There Defiently Good, And Pop It Into Your Computer And Watch The Video's For Candy And Walk Me Home And A Exclusive Interview With Mandy Her Self. If That's Not Enough It Also Has A Screen Saver, Inside The Case Youll Find A Fold Out Poster Of The Cover Of The Cd. This Is One Of My Favorite Cd's Right Now, I Recomend It To Everybody.!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","Ok, this is it. mandy has talent, but i hate this CD. The old one is SO much better. They RUINED SO REAL AND CANDY! i think u should buy the first one, but if u like So Real and Candy from the old one, don't buy it!"
2,perhaps a better attempt this time,"Sold, failed, pulled back, repackaged and back on the shelves again. This is Mandy Moore. ""Another one of those people-we-love-to-hate"". Despite failing the first time, this child does not give up hope and decides to try on the ballad departments. She showscases nice ballads, though her weak vocals cannot carry much on the emotion and the dexterity needed to convey the message. Many will be left smitten with the breeziness of ""I Wanna Be With You"" though even on her strongest song, her vocals quiver to reach her notes. I really don't know if it's safe to say whether this repackaged album will do anything to help Moore improve her standings. But if you see her, tell her she'll improve all standings if she takes proper vocal lessons first."
4,Almost perfect!,"This album is surprisingly good, despite lack of originality, and a few mediocre cuts, ('I like it' springs to mind). The album shares a blend of typical teenpop ('Candy' and 'So real' which easily could have been mistaken for a Backstreet boys choon), with some classy, mature moments thrown in 'Lock me in your heart', 'The way to my heart' and 'Walk me home'. It kind of feels like Britney, Christina and Jessica thrown into one. I strongly suggest this to any pop fan although have the control ready to skip over the yawnsome, ucky, luvvy duvvy 'Want you back' and 'Your face' which never fails to bring a 'DISGUSTED' reaction whenever i hear the amount of corny cheese dripping from it! This is no overreaction. Basically, don't hesitate to buy it as long as you follow the above instructions."
5,I love mandy,"This is a wonderful cd. It is 30000 times better than her first one, and i loved So Real! If you're not sure on her, I just want to say she is realllllllly nice. She was at our mall signing autographs and she was very grateful for all the fans. Her bubbling personality reflects off her poppy music. Great job Mandy, you are the best!"
4,Cool CD!!,"The item shipped very quickly, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this item to a friend."
1,Two thumbs down,"What is wrong with the world today. I really think that the only fans Mandy has are below theage of 8. At least Britney has some fans who know what real music is. Mandy's cd is a cheap rip-off of Brit. She sounds awful on the love songs, and all the new songs are bad. Mandy is really trying to rip us off with this cd cause it only has one new song that is worth it. Her old stuff is pretty bad too. Sorry Mandy, but don't quit your day job!"
2,Installation disk not compatible with computer,I am disappointed because the installation disk would not work with my HP7-1234 computer. The disk is labeled Quickcam 8-4-1 Driver Installer. I assume that it is the wrong disk. I purchased this computer in June.
1,WARNING MUST READ THIS!!!!,"Beware of this product, it ONLY works on windows XP. I called Logitech and they told me exactly that it will NOT work with anything besides Windows XP. If you are planning on buying this and are not currently using Windows XP then keep on searching for other cameras."
1,Awful quality,I ordered this since I am moving away to college in the fall and I got myself the Logitech Notebook Pro which is a thousand times better. The picture quality is ridiculous and whenever I took a picture my computer crashed! I am returning this immediately!
3,So-so. Go with the 4000 Pro instead.,"I compared this with the Logitech Quickcam 4000 Pro.Both are:- Easy to install, plug and play, no issues- Have great software, solid, etc.- Robust, reliable.However:- This one is less expensive- The 4000 pro has CONSIDERABLY better image quality. I found this one to be very grainy and borderline unacceptable.If price is the primary concern, this one isn't a disaster and it didn't have quality problems.However, if you can afford the added cost, you'll be happier with the pro."
3,"o.k quality, but be aware","The overall picture quality is just so so. But be aware that it has only a fix focus. You are not able to adjust the focus, so objects out of the focus range are not clear. Frame rate is o.k though since it is USB 2.0"
1,What the heck happened!,"The 6th one was better than this. Read the other review it says the same thing I want to say. Rent 1,2,3,4,5, not 6 and certainly not 7."
2,VERY BAD,"I enjoyed every Police Academy movie except this one. This one was TERRIBLE. It was not funny AT ALL. Like other people, I had no idea this movie was even made until I saw it on the shelf in a video store. I rented it and I was very disapointed. The only reason anyone would want to see this or get it would be to complete there Police Academy collection. I would strongly advise you not to rent it or buy it for laughs."
2,No Hooks No Hightower No procter NO Good :(,i must Be Truth full I love the police academy films ALL Butthis one.it never fails to put me to sleep The jokes are notfunny the acting is very Bad and hightower HooKS AND proctorare missing thats a nother reason i Did not care for the filmthey never even explain what happen to them.I guess David graflesile easterbrook micheal winslow and Gw bailey Must haveneeded the cash im being kind giving this movie 2 stars causei am a fan of the series But this movie gets a big Z For beingboring it works better then any sleeping pill .
4,Charles Schlatter joins the team in Moscow.,"This movie went straight to video.After 10 years of Police Academy films, we finally have reached the last one for a while until 2006.Original cast members returning: G.W. Bailey, George Gaynes, David Graf, Michael Winslow and Leslie Easterbrook.Charles Schlatter is the new guy (who later got busy in CBS Diagnosis: Murder tv series). This time their special skills are needed in Moscow, Russia were they meet Christopher Lee, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani and many Russian actors.What put the screenwriters in a Russian mood? Perhaps they should have gone back to Miami Beach or visited Las Vegas?Highlight: Leslie Easterbrook is really singing.Followed by an animated cartoon series in 1988 and a Police Academy tv series in 1997."
4,An OK movie,"Now, I know I usually right long reviews, but I'm in a hurray, so I'm gonna make it short. This is an ok film. It is a little slow on the humor and most of the good charcters are gone like Moses Hightower, Hooks, Doug Fackler, Procter, and Nick Lassrad, and Mahoney who quit a long time ago. There is the odd little chuckle which makes it ok to watch on a boring sunday afternoon. Get the Police Academy pack on dvd when it comes out on April 6."
3,Must see,Police Academy movies I grew up on this is like the oldest one and most of the actors you can tell have aged might not be the best of the series but still ya gotta see it...
2,Ok movie,This is the only police academy movie that isn't too funny. It's still ok and not that bad. Pick up the pack on dvd when it comes out in april.
5,Great Movie,"Some of the charecters may be gone, but I still love it. But it on dvd, infact, get the box set."
2,BAD COPS BAD COPS!! WHATCHA GONNA DO???,The only thing I have to say is these are the only kinds of movies where the cops are a joke! At least according to Darryl Gates. Why don't there be a police academy movie/DVD gift set??
1,Hurts so Bad!,"This movie was everything I feared it would be--bleak, pretentious, and confusing. The one sin I haven't heard enumerated yet by other disappointed reviewers is that PT Anderson demonstrated so little storytelling ability! Two main complaints: first, the dialogue was on the nose. Every character yelled about how awful their lives were and how much they hated each other. Second, Anderson repeated characters and scenes so literally that they weren't thematic, they were redundant. Two old men dying of cancer who lament the fact they cheated on their wives? The repetition diluted the impact that either scene would have had on its own. The only saving grace of the film was Aimee Mann's aural presence. Spare yourself three hours of film agony and go buy her latest album instead."
1,Magnolia,"This movie sucked worse than an old Hoover vacuum cleaner. My God, what did the director think he was doing?Now, I know there are a lot of pseudo-intellects out there who see something deep and apocolyptic in this film. To them I say get off the drugs and try reality. This stream of unconsciousnes crap is the worst of a very poor year in the movie industry. The notion that Cruise was nominated for this is ludicrous.The great climax has power only in its ability to turn ones's stomach. That the director took three hours to tell this tale shows how sadistic a person he must be. Half the people in the theater left when I saw it originally. Trying it a seond time with two carbon enhancement, didn't help either."
1,garbage.,"this movie was garbage. it was boring, too long, unintelligent, pretentious, and had lots and lots of needless swearing and tantrums. there was no subtlety, no real depth or intelligence to this film, and best of all there was a cast sing-along. the plot - what plot? oh yes it was a film about coincidence and redemption that takes place all in one day in the san fernando valley. uh huh. overall, it was a miserable moviegoing experience, which means it should find wide appeal with wannabes, film critics, sensitive people, whacked-out film students, psuedo-intellectuals, emotionally unstable people, and holdovers from last decade's coffeehouse scene. in which case, enjoy, you have found your pied piping prophet"
1,More painful than a kick in the nuts,"What would happen if you took the seven worst movies by the seven best actors in hollywood and crammed it all into one 3+ hour long movie? Well, watch Magnolia to find out. This movie is that bad. Its like watching Ishtar end to end -- twice -- in one sitting. Not even famous actors like William H Macy or Tom Cruise could have saved this one. Now if you liked Ishtar or root canals or hitting yourself in the thumb with a hammer repeatedly, you should watch this movie. You have been warned."
2,Warped Eclectic Vignettes,"""Magnolia"" was released in 1999 and has a star-studded cast (John C. Reilly, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards and more....) that do their best to get this contrived story of random lives coming together for a strange, artificial climax. It is a movie that only certain people will enjoy. It was unbelievable overall, and the plots contrived to fit the ending. The movie has both comedy and poignant scenes as the vignettes strive to gain your interest. The lives of several people in the San Fernando Valley hit a wall together and we watch the unbelievable blow up before our eyes-including frogs falling from the skies.Overall, it is hard to follow and the outrageous plots tire one's imagination."
2,Boring,"This movie was not for me. I felt it lacked plot, depth, and any sort of ability to entertain or capture an audience. There is symbolism through out the movie, but you have to be looking for it and know what it is when you see. At best this is a rental, but only if you really, really want to see it. Otherwise, I say pass."
1,Horrible!,"This movie is terrible. Unless you want to sit through two and a half hours of junk to get to the thirty minutes that are actually worth something, do not buy this."
1,GRAVE INJUSTICE!!,"The opening 10 minutes of this film were great, exploring the urban legend of the diver who was scooped up by a water carrying plane on its way to a bush fire, after the fire the diver is found in a smouldering tree! excellent i thought! here comes a great film!..... how wrong i was! from a really entertaining intro came a bunch of little stories that climax into 1 plot. None of the characters are very interesting and only 1 is remotley likable( the cop) by the end i was disinterested and bored by it all i fell asleep within 5 minutes.A truly long(3hours) and very dull movie that is only watchable once.Anyone buying this film on DVD before actually seeing it or only on the basis of these reviews needs their head testing. My favourites are:-Pulp Fiction,Sleepy Hollow,Private Ryan,Lost Boys and Snatch."
3,It'll stay with you...,"I really like this movie, but it's not one that I can watch over and over again, like I can most other movies. There are many plots, subplots, twists and turns, but the story line with Tom Cruise and Juliane Moore was the best. It reduced me to sobs more than once. Everyone should see this movie, but don't be surprised if it's not one you'll be in a hurry to see again."
5,Magnificent Magnolia is a Masterpiece,"Brilliant. Brilliant. The performances here are blistering and unforgettable - Cruise, Robards, Moore, and Macy absolutely sensational. Everything is connected in the film, the songs, the television, the people. The past never fades, but grows stronger and stronger. Anderson shows the importance of family love, and what havoc, what hell, a bunch of [bad] Dads can inflict on their children. I know there are those who dissent, but I believe this is one of the most important movies of the decade. The ""ecological"" conclusion is so beyond description and so fitting. Although it's too long, it's truly worth watching over and over again. Aimee Mann's song are also magnificent."
2,overwrought melodrama,"i understand the movie. i like the overall message. but this would have been a much better movie in two hours than it is in three.in short, the direction is of the ""why make this scene last two minutes, when it can last five?"" variety. lingering camera shots that serve no apparent purpose. unlikeable characters, almost across the board, and too many of them. a laugh-out-loud musical number (yes, really) that's supposed to be deathly serious, about two hours and twenty minutes in. a rather insulting ending that greatly disappoints non critic-types in the audience, given how great the first ten minutes are.one star for the chapter stops and fast forward options on the DVD version. one star for how good this movie can be when you fast forward liberally. total: 2 stars."
2,"OK Film...NOT an Altman Masterpiece, However","It ain't Short Cuts, but it tries real hard to be. Hey PTA, who you gonna rip-off for your next film? Kubrick? Hitchcock? You already tried (and failed) to mimic Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese. Try getting your own sense of style and DIRECTION."
3,A 3-hour downer,"These intertwining tales are full of anger, tragedy, obscenity, incontinence, and a rain of frogs. Where is the joy? Where (except in the final minute) is the redemption of the human spirit? Can the world really be this messed up - and even if it is, how is this entertainment?Sorry. I was looking for drama and interesting stories; I got 3+ hours of depression and despair. Despite the fine acting by most of the cast, I truly don't understand what anyone would like about this movie."
3,Like an exteded soap opera,"This film is pretty good. The performances were excellent, I especially liked Tom Cruise and Phillip Baker Hall but this has to be one of the most overlong movies of all time. It takes forever getting to where it's going but still, it's far from boring. Although it is a bit overrated."
3,"Knockout Performances, but Movie Overlong","From the writer-director of ""Boogie Nights"", this 3 hour plus drama follows several different stories over the course of a weekend in Los Angeles. Most of the characters are fascinating, and ultimately there are maybe too many stories going on. The movie is in some ways a disappointment, but it's worth seeing for some individual scenes and knockout performances (Tom Cruise got an Oscar nomination and a lot of attention for his role, but the rest of the cast is just as good if not better, especially Julianne Moore, Jason Robards and William H. Macy). Finally, to watch this one you have to have a high tolerance for the ""F"" word."
2,What was the Point?,"I consider myself open minded, well read, and not afraid of movies and books out of the main stream. But Magnolia was one movie that left me wondering...""what was that?"" The movie began with ""urban legend"" anecdotes to show how life defies the odds and even the impossible can happen. Is it fate? Or is it just the way life is? This is a movie of characters facing great challenges in their life and how each individual challenge is linked together. The acting is terrific, the use of music superb, and the view of life as a depressing weather forecast is clever. But the ""patchwork"" unravels and the personal lives of the characters aren't tied together as strong as they could be. This is not a film with an occasional downpour of emotion. It's Noah's deluge! And in the end when we look for the sun breaking through the clouds and a dove returning with a flowering twig, the rain continues to fall. Life continues and I guess we need to wait for the sequel to see what happens."
2,Just a weird movie,"This movie is a movie that makes you think, and makes you think yourself into nowhere. It's like deciphering old Egyptian code to find out it has some lame message. The performances are really good, but it doesn't matter because the movie is to nuts and takes you out. I really think P.T. Anderson was trying to create something brilliant and almost did, but didn't and there for it really sucks. The best part of this movie is the song by Aimee Mann called ""Save Me""."
2,Sad movie with beautiful music and some good acting,"Magnolia is way too weird for me. I watched the whole thing hoping that it would get better and also hoping that it would somehow make sense in the end. I guess it was not supposed to make sense ... it was just supposed to show you how people's lives interconnect. There are a some good things about this movie though! Such as the music, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Melora Walters' BIG and beautiful smile at the end. My heart went out to Stanley the Whiz Kid and I cried for him. Great acting by Blackman, Hoffman and Walters. Also, Cruise plays a great egomaniac!"
2,This movie blows,"You wade through three hours of a decent film to encounter one of the wirst endings I've seen on a film since - geez I don't remember when. Don't bother with this clunker. I went to fil school and I still don't think it's ""cool."" Director PTA should rot in h-e-double hockey stciks for offering this up as his follow-up to ""Boogie Nights."" Sure, the Aimee Mann sing along is cool, but he could have made that a music video, in fact music videos is all he's good for at this point. He's been directing annorexic girlfriend Fionna Applegate's videos for the past few years. Couldn't he have spared Tom Cruise's best performance for a better film?"
1,Don't bother...,"Youre going to either love this movie or hate it. I'm usually on the ""love it"" side but this one was a total disaster. The plot, the LENGTH (goes on forever), theres no excitement, and the actors overact in every scene."
1,What a waste of celuloid!!,This is the worst film I have ever seen!! What a huge waste of my time. The writter/director tries to make a complex film about nothing! It really stunk!
