2,Needs an editor,"As numerous other reviewers have stated, the author comes across as living what he speaks. I don't have a problem with this. I do have a problem that this book is over 400 pages when it could've easily been 150. The writing is awful. There are endless sentence fragments, unfinished thoughts -- the whole book feels like a journal entry."
2,SlooooooW,"Deep, non-dualistic, and too slow and ponderous by a self-righteous writer who is really a carpenter pretending to be very deep by being incognito."
2,don't waste money on plastic,I paid $8 extra for the black poster hangers. They look awful and they don't work. The picture was cute.
1,Avoid!,"There is a reason that this game has been marked down so soon after it's release. Rise of the Imperfects isn't even worth it after the markdown. The 7 people who purchased it for full price probably understand this.The controls are terrible. The graphics are bland. This game would be more suited as a Gameboy Advance title, or compost, your pick."
5,Long time since i played it,"This game was in lack of other words, extremely disspaointing...Gameplay was odd, and even a little cousin of mine didn't like it, even though he is mutant's frantic!"
1,Worst game ever.,This game won't let you save your progress! It is very frustrating. It doesn't have good graphics and there is not a great choice of characters.
3,nirvana's children,"while the story seems good the book actually fails to capture what it sets out to. it tells of the young boys first time making ""disease"". and of other things the whole time reading it i thought this kid had a mental disorder that should have been spotted years ago."
2,Not for implementors.,"The author has done good work in introducing the basic concepts in Value-at-Risk. However, the text leaves some important statistical and implementation points hidden, making implementing VaR look far too easy. For example, there is no discussion about the problems involved in long-term forecasting of correlations and volatilities.The much advertised ""new distinctive investment approach"", the so called ""Generalized Sharpe Rule"" is a rather naive treatment on classical risk/return analysis. However, the lack of mathematical rigour is well compensated with good references."
3,It doesn't touch upon the practical or real issues..,"With the hype of 'risk management' technical books around one is so easily got confused by the title. This book seems to cover quite a bit of theory and development going beyond standard VaR methodology, i.e. joint log normality assumption on market factors etc, however the most crucial application: specific risk methodology, how to get to the tail of the distribution, backtesting techniques are not covered. Today's risk manager need to focus more on the real issues, and I don't think Mr Dowd's book can deliver that. OK for beginners, but not for real risk people."
4,don't miss this one,"I quite enjoyed this book & wasn;t disappointed that the Marshal wasn;t in it much. After all, murders [and kidnappings ] are handled not by his office, but by higher ranking people like Captain Maestrangengelo. However I would have liked to have some information about his personal & inner life. We learned more about his assistant and the Substitute [I assume this means assistant] Prosecutor than about the captain. And there was enough about the Marshal to advance his story."
3,Simenon without the bite,"I picked up this book because all the blurbs on the jacket compared Nabb's writing to Simenon, who I adore. The comparison is a fair one-- we have the ordinary European detective and the relentlessly pedestrian situations, but something of the bite and wit that Simenon brings to every novel is missing and without that edge, the book only seems a bit bland."
2,Puh-lease,"Ok, there is no sense in buying this book, when there are plenty of others to buy instead. Although it is an easy read, it is not a good book for anyone looking to implement the Six Sigma methodology.Instead, I recommend the new Six Sigma Business Scorecard. It is insightful, and incredibly creative in its new approach."
5,Great Guide,This pocket guide is great. It has everything you need about six sigma projects in a very concise and direct way. You can't beat the price either!
4,Great little reference guide,"This book is great for newly trained Belts running their first projects, or going through training. I'm an experience Black Belt but use it as a reference to help explain techniques to my trainee Belts. Clearly written and easy to read. Would benefit from some examples to explain some of the formulas/tools."
5,The Best Pocket Guide to Six Sigma Available,"I don't due encomiums very often (check out the rest of my reviews); but Rath & Strong's pocket guide simply floored me.I bought a dozen several months ago to try out on my black belts and green belts. They snapped them up and refused to return them. My own copy is already dog-eared and tattered from overuse.This is a wonderful tool. It breaks down the methodology in clear, concise steps and provides a desperately-needed matrix showing which tools are typically employed at each phase. It offers short, effective descriptions of the most commonly-used tools.As someone who'd been given to lugging Breyfogle's ""Implementing Six Sigma"" to meetings, Rath & Strong's guide has been a welcome relief.Pick yours up today."
5,Easy to Use,"Rath & Strong's Six Sigma Pocket Guide is an easy to use, handy reference book for anyone starting out with Six Sigma. It is extremely well organized with an overview chapter and seperate chapters for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. It is packed with useful forms, charts, and examples that help the new Six Sigma Practitioner quickly recall information from his or her training. Each chapter ends with a very handy ""Completion Checklist"" that helps the reader understand what should be completed at the end of each phase of a Six Sigma Project.I plan on making this book a standard handout in my Green Belt training classes."
2,Fabulous Yasmin,"Yasmin reminds me of the new years Yasmin.If you are a big fan of New Years Yasmin,you should like this doll too.She is so cute in everything she comes with.Buy her...if you like New Years Yasmin.Love always,Ruby Tuesday"
2,UMM......,I don`t think she is sooo fabulous in my opinion.I could be better.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*
3,WOW!!,"I cannot believe you guys could curse like that! g's u guys would have gotton smacked if you had my mom! even if they were blurped out like that. but i do agree they are revealing. but their not bad enough to *shake* your head. they are gettin more and more revealing. but they are a collecters item that adults buy for themselves too. and if you saw it on here and looked at all the pictures then this doesnt apply to you, but if you saw it and just bought it without looking it all over, then its not mga's fault! its urs for buying it in the 1st place!when i was little all i had were barbies that didn't have very cute clothes but these dolls have awsome clothes! i look idolize them!"
2,cool without a cause,the doll i had gotten looked so cool but when i opened it it wasboring i stoped playing with and it was a wast now looking back on that mga toys are foney rued and stuiped i know that i will never buy or ask for a bratz because of this toy we have punksand kid who are persed in all the wrong places i hate mga and bratz
5,One Amazing guy,I read this book when I was in the Fourth grade. You are probablly wondering why such a young girl grabbed ahold of this wonderful book. Well Terry Thomas is my Step Father. Once I read this book it showed me that love really does exist and some people take it for granted. I have listened to Terry tell me the story of him and Nancy many times. Everytime I hear it my heart aches. I hope when people read this book they understand life can get a lot worse. I definantly think this book should come back to print!
4,"A Love Story, A Tragedy, Life goes on","This book was very moving to me as a young woman who was about to be married and also drove a VW Bug. My aunt insisted that we not take the VW on our honeymoon, but we did anyway! This is a book that details the love and brief marriage of a young couple deeply in love with each other and the Lord. I and several of my friends had a good cry over this one!"
4,"Grim, but still good Simpson","I've only listened to the Symphony twice. I'm enjoying it more each time. Still, my favorite Simpson is his Symphony 4. That has a vibrant subtle humor that I enjoy."
5,Climbing High,"Simmons has long been a defender of a concept that has recently been left by the wayside; education. In a world of soft standards, and self esteem driven educational goals, Simmons stands up for the things that matter."
5,A Great Argument for the Classics,"This book is a tremendous resource not only for some history of education, but it intelligently explains the importance of Greek and Latin as well. Simmons could have spent a little more time, in my opinion, exploring some of the arguments against learning the classics, such as the (perhaps justifiable) fear of polluting young minds with ""pagan"" philosophy and racy tales. He does seem to think Greek and Latin exercises will enable children to rightly discern between the proverbial baby and the bathwater, which they undoubtedly will to a point. One cannot help but notice that Simmons has, however, given too high a place to these languages. They are important to learn, but they are not the pinnacle he makes them out to be. He over-sells in my estimation. That said, it is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Another mewling conservative,"Another mewling conservative decrying the present state of American education and calling for a return of the Greek and Latin classics. All the usual suspects are included: Bill Clinton, multiculturalism, etc. It's less a call for a return to the basics than a whining political screed and written with all the Asiatic tinsel of a Bill Buckley, who wrote the foreword and gave the book his blessing. There is much good being done in public education, and the classics are not being ignored. It's just that education--and a classical education at that--is no longer the exclusive right of a privileged caste, which is what really bothers these people."
5,Awesome,"Azumi is a movie that everyone must see. It isn't the best of it's genre nor does it really excel in any other area except maybe in production or death toll lol This just is a movie that everyone should at least see once. Full of action, a little drama, humor and heartache."
2,Boring As Hell,"If you want a cool Ninja flick, we all know it's Ninja Assassin. This one was beyond boring... maybe 3 pretty good fight sequences in over 2 hours."
2,Horrible!!!!!!,"i gave it two stars cuz azumi herself is so damn hot i watched the whole thing because of her. no other reason really. so that in itself deserves two stars. the swordplay is really bad, which is bad for me cuz i was hoping to see excellent swordplay. total opposite. my little sisters enjoyed this movie alot though...."
1,Just Say No.,"If you like Jackie Chan, Yun-Fat Chow, Jet Li, Tony Jaa(Ong-Bak), or even Stephen Chow THEN SAVE YOUR MONEY, not even a rental.Nonsense story line. IMHO, Parts of the plot don't conform to any martial arts philosophy, tradition, or military logic. That ruined the movie for me. But if that hadn't, then the rest of the movie would have still been a disappointment.I should have waited for more reviews. And, that's why I added this review."
4,Bloody Violence,"I highly recommend this film for those who like samurai movies (it is one of my favorites). ""Azumi"" is an over-the-top hack-and-slash action film that will not disappoint. (There are subtitles).The action are far and few in between and the sword fight is not really well cherograph but it was a decent film with lots of action for the ninja fans.Jo Odigiri was not what I expected from his previous film.But it was still pretty good"
4,BLISStering action and violence.,"Previously, I had heard nothing about Azumi. It was until I saw it that I had discovered a truely enjoyable and violent action film. Based in Japan, Azumi is about a group of assissins in a war between a Samurai sword wielding gang. With an acceptable story and loaded with lightning speed Samurai action, Azumi is a perfect Sunday-stay-in film. With very impressive stunts and deaths, Azumi will not dissapoint. However, it has *subtitles*.Azumi also has one of the best and most psychotic villians I have seen.Azumi is a brilliant action film and highly recommended."
3,Missing scenes,"I already have the Japanese version of Azumi which is IMO a 5 star film, I perchased this ""Collectors Edition"" cause I thought it may have some deleted scenes, but much to my suprise there were a few scenes that were missing, and some of the subtitles are incorrect. If you have never seen this film I would pick it up, but for someone who already has the Japanese version it is a waste of time."
2,dont buy,"this is one of the best movies ever but for pp who only know English, note there are NO english voice overs or w/e its called in this version. buy the $20 version."
2,Forget about it,"The only reason I gave this flick 2 stars was because I did sit through it.... almost. If you dressed these'assassins' up in suits you'd have a power ranger movie. Azumi herself is cuter than peach cobbler, and that'sexactly how she portray's her ultimate assassin role. The fight scenes were badly rendered. I mean REALLY. Theplot was just ridiculous. They layed about 10 seconds of background and expected you to beleive this joke. Thecinematogragy was only slightly better than the ineptness of the rest of this thing. Don't pay money for this thing. Try Dororo or something if you're looking for come to life Anime."
3,"decent action flick, poor dub job",This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. It took three times butI made it through the film. I was not happy that the film was dubbed instead ofhaving subtitles. It seems like they dubbed modern English slang into this Asianperiod piece. I must say that the film got much better as the story moved along.Nice action with some very nice sword play. Next to some of the great films thathave come out of Asia recently this movie is just all right. Not bad for the AmazonVOD rental price.
5,Energetic,"This movie was great. Aya Ueto did a magnificant job playing Azumi. She is a very lively actress. The plot was a good approach but, it kind of fizzled towards the end. The true story in my opinion was how Azumi dealt with her demons.I was more caught up with the Azumi character than I did the original plot. The stuff she had to do to her friend in the beginning would have a tremendous impact on anyone but, to have to live with would make it that much worse. That is where revenge and justice comes in.The fight scenes were incredible. I do not believe I have seen a Samurai movie where the hero goes through a gautlant of people like she does.just awesome swordplay."
3,not a rower you pull for,"i am only surprised that keisling's rowing career wasn't shortened by injury, since he must have nearly broken his arm patting himself on the back. I did not find keisling a likeable character at all, and because he was so insecure about his place amongst the other good oarsmen at yale, he made them seem boorish as well. for a guy who never was on a boat that beat harvard (and is widely thought to have ""bagged"") towards the end of his final race, he sure thinks a lot of himself. there are a ton of rowers who came to yale with little or no rowing background and went on to great careers. there are also many others who are more sympathetic than keisling. i never rooted for him or his boats to due well in the races because he seemed like such a jerk. and he writes like one too!"
1,Complete junk -- doesn't work on windows XP at all,"Despite the assurances in the description and packaging that this works with Windows XP,it emphatically does not.The science one crashes every 1/2 hour or so.The Carmen Sandiego one locks up within 5 minuntes every time.I'm so annoyed I'm not going to even bother installing the last one.This is complete garbage software. I wonder if they do any QA at all.Perhaps it works with Windows 95 or something, but it certainly doesnt work with windows XP.My testing:I tried it on two completely different windows XP machines: one 3 years old with pentium 2 processor running XP pro, and one 2 months old running latest and greatest pentium 4 and XP home. Neither works. Both show the symptoms described above.I checked the websites for patches for this software, and none are available."
1,Adventure Workshop 4th-6th Grade,"Installs fine, but doesn't run on Windows 2000. It pops into the program and back out.There website has no real help, and there is no phone, or email support for the product.Complete trash, with no support. Very frustrating."
3,"Very good sci-fi, despite the lame monster....","Not bad at all!! This flick is everything I look for in a 50's sci-fi except for the homemade looking monster. Other than this paper-mache looking parrot from outer space, the direction, camera work, acting, and story were all first rate.This is also the earliest sci-fi I've seen that includes the concept of aliens using humans as a host for incubating their younglings(did Ridley Scott's Alien kipe the idea from this flick?).For the price, it can't be beat. Make sure you get the Alpha version with the red cover. The transfer and sound are far superior to the other release of this film."
3,Drive in fare,"This is a perfect example of a ""B' 50's monster movie, comparable to ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" or "" The Giant Claw"" The technical details of this movie aren't worth mentioning, acting's pretty bad too, and the monster looks like a giant paper mache' parrot made by a class of kindergarteners. Despite all that negativity I liked this movie for the same reason I like the two I mentioned above, it's fun to watch. And Bronson's cave makes an appearance, you'll recognize it from several other flicks"
3,A night to remember!,"I've been a HUGE fan of this movie ever since I first saw it at my local neighborhood movie theatre way back in the early 60's. It's spooky as hell and has great, eerie music and creepy atmosphere. I bought Retromedia's dvd when it was first released a few years ago, but as with many of their dvd releases, I was somewhat disappointed with the choppy picture quality. There were a lot of jump cuts thruout the movie, as if it had been edited to allow for tv commercials. Surprisingly, the picture quality on the Alpha dvd is smoother overall and even a bit clearer. Overall, the Alpha version is the better buy if you're a fan of this 50's sci-fi classic!"
2,"Limited ""Save Game"" feature ruins this","I found this game incredibly easy and was able to get to the end of levels to fight the big boss -- however it takes a number times to figure out each boss and defeat them -- the worst feature about this game was that you CANNOT save where you left off -- if you screw up at the end you must complete the entire level over again before you can face the boss again -- OVER AND OVER until you get it right or until you are sick of it and sell it on eBay. It's extremely tedious.Also -- with regard to story and characters -- I found them uninteresting and kind of lame. If you want a great game with lots of humor, sick and twisted characters, fun action play and great animation then get MEDIEVIL RESURECTION -- if only they would make more like that."
3,Death Jr. just an O.K. game,Death Jr. wasn't as fun as i thought it would be. The levels are hard and the graphics are bad. However the story line is funny and interesting. This game would not be good for kids under 10 or 11 because it has a lot of gore and it has a little bit of language. Death Jr. is an ok game if you r looking for a bad challenge. But if your looking for a fun and exiting game try somthing else.
4,Review the DVD or the movie?,"I bought this to fill out my collection of versions of ""The Jazz Singer"". The four films starred Al Jolson (1927), Danny Thomas (1953), Jerry Lewis (1959) and Neil Diamond (1980). Each version was essentially an exhibition of the starring performer's individual style. The story of each was about a Jewish singer who wanted to break out of the traditional role of cantor to get into popular show business.Mr. Thomas was a very popular entertainer in his time. This movie shows off his various talents. I enjoyed this version, but then, I am a fan of older films, especially musicals.As a review of the DVD, well, it's a DVD and plays well in my DVD player, so I suppose it's wonderful."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTING,"I ORDERED THESE SHOES AND WAITED 2 WEEKS, THE COMPANY EMAILS ME AND SAYS THE ORDER HAS BEEN BACKORDERED. I WAIT 1 MORE WEEK AND THEN THEY EMAIL ME BACK SAYING THE ORDER IS OUT OF STOCK. THIS IS VERY UNFAIR B/C WHEN I ORDERED THE ITEM IT SAYS THEY WERE IN STOCK! I AM STILL WAITING FOR A REFUND. BEWARE"
3,In line with the their other albums,"I certainly think the Bangles are talented, but I never believed they could make a complete, start-to-finish, solid album like the Go-Go's and other bands could. The good songs are great, and the not-so good ones are forgettable. I think this has been true on all their albums. So the high-points? The songs Doll Revolution, Single By Choice, and Mixed Messages are great. So, that's 3 songs out of 15...you decide."
2,I Wanted To Tear Off My Own Head,"Tear Off Your Own Head is a great song - classic Bangles. Something That You Said is nice. Ride The Ride is cool and probably my favorite song on this CD. But the rest??? The girls harmonize as great as ever, but almost all of these songs are lackluster and lifeless. Where's the rock??? I optimistically bought this back in 2003 and listened to it many times trying to like it, hoping it would grow on me, but it didn't happen. I find most of these songs almost painful to listen to, especially Single By Choice, which gets my vote for the worst Bangles song ever. It wasn't worth the 15 year wait since Everything, their last album before breaking up in 1989. Hopefully if the ladies try it again they will rock a little harder. Check out Susanna's 1996 solo CD - it rocks!!"
2,The Opposite of Interesting,"I'll go against the grain here: In my opinion ""Everything"" is the band's best album to date. It pushed their musicianship, writing, and arranging to a new place. It was interesting in that it WASN'T the same sound.That same sound, unfortunately, IS what we have with ""Doll Revolution"". Most of the album is mid-tempo, and probably could easily be done live as a medley. The vocals and harmonies are EXACTLY what one would expect (with some small exceptions) and are so predicable, and uninspired that it made me sad.As talented artists, with a lot of time on their hands between Bangle releases, I would really have liked to have heard some interesting music that reflected some growth during their absence. Yes, I agree that the lyrical themes are more mature (in some, but not all cases), but musically, this is not anything interesting, in fact, the opposite."
3,Bangles still don't get it.,"I was amazed that Hoffs only sings lead on 4 songs. She is the only one that has a special voice. They still must have the same problem that broke the group up. They were jealous of her popularity instead of embracing it and feeling fortunate that they had something special. Too bad, because with Hoff's voice and the groups harmonies, they could be much better."
3,Not enough Hoffs!,"I loved the Bangles back in the good old days of the 80s, and so I was pretty excited when this CD came out. But like the title says, there is too little Susanna Hoffs and too much of that other one singing. None of the songs are especially strong, but ""Something That You Said"" and a couple of other tracks are decent, and show Hoffs in good form. But the other songs, about 2/3 of them, are hard to listen to, as the ""other singer"" does the vocals in her dull monotone voice. Too bad! Hope they come out with another album with Hoffs on all the vocals..."
2,Not enough Susanna Hoffs,"Doll Revolution has one major flaw. Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals. (I love to hear her sing.) If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more. While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here. The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals. It's just that simple."
2,just kinda there,when the Bangles first came out in the 80's that had a cool vibe about them.they were if you will a Poor Maid's version of the Go-Go Girls.and over time they never quite shook that tag.the Bangles never wrote songs that took off was the big knock against them then&still.some of the Instrumentation is alright in spots but Vocally not much has changed.
1,Dull Revolution,"I was very disappointed in this CD. I was looking so forward to its release. I love female singers and female groups, not the fluff of that Spears girl and such. I like real artists. I loved the Bangles earlier releases. What happened here and where is the revolution? So goes another year in music without a standout CD for me to savor. I was counting on the Bangles to save this year in music for me as the Go-Go's did in 2001 with the release of their CD. Please female artists out there give me something to sink my teeth in to. I am in need of good new music. I am so tired of having to listen to the same CDs over and over because of the lack of good music out there."
4,Nice Comeback!,"'Doll Revolution' was the Bangles first release since 1988's 'Everything', released in 2003. This new album proves that the ""gurls"" still have what it takes after all this time & prove it on standout tracks such as ""Something That You Said"", ""Tear Off Your Own Head (It's A Doll Revolution)"", ""Song For A Good Son"", ""Ask Me No Questions"", & ""The Rain Song"". They harmonize better than anyone I've ever listened to & write such beautiful songs. If you choose to skip purchasing this gem, you're making a BIG mistake & missing out on all the fun!"
4,They're back and loving it!!!!,"I was a fan of the Bangles in the early 80's, so when I heard they were going to perform a few songs and do a CD signing in my town, I was all over it. They don't disappoint. Acoustically, they were so impressive. The audience was emotional. I enjoy the fact that the lead vocals have been more evenly distributed to every member, so all the ladies get an opportunity to present their talents both instrumentally and vocally. They put a lot of time and effort into making this album a success. I recommend spending some of that ATM $$."
3,Almost Bangleicous,"The disc starts top-heavy with its best music. The rocking title track and harmoneous ""Stealing Rosemary"" lead into the highlight of the album, the made-for-heavy-rotation-on-every-pop-station ""Something That You Said"". Unfortunately, things go downhill from here.It's not that the rest of the disc is bad...it's filled with solid tracks and a couple of gems (especially ""Ride the Ride""), but the momentum is just lost with Tracks 5 and 6, the Bangles' take on Vicki Peterson's other band's ""Rain Song"", and the dreadful ""Nickel Romeo"". Everything past these two tracks could have held my momentum for the duration, but it's just gone.If The Bangles get a US distribution deal, they would be best served to lose these two tracks completely. Even without the (alleged) bonus tracks at the end, it would be a much better disc. I would just dub a copy with the two tracks omitted, but the copy protection (which also makes the disc skip in about a half dozen specific places) ruined that idea."
4,"Welcome back, ladies!!","A fan of the Bangles since 1984's, ""All Over the Place"", I am thrilled to have their latest release in hand(bought in Europe where it's not quite as pricey)! The CD kicks off with Elvis Costello's ""Tear Off Your Own Head"", which is the Bangles in their element - hard-rockin' and harmonizin' up a storm. The rest of the songs go up and down from there. A few gems (""Ride the Ride"", ""Here Right Now"", ""Mixed Messages""), some mediocre (""Grateful""), but all listenable. Closer in flavor to ""AOTP"" and ""Everything"" than ""Different Light"" - which is a good thing.At a recent club date, the group was in top form, looking and sounding terrific as ever! The Bangles skipped the 'commerical' route this time in favor of doing it their own way, and the results are rewarding. Less bubblegum, a bit more garage-band, which is where they excell."
5,A Must-Buy,"If Oprah still had her book club, Night Swimming would be her number one pick this summer.Imagine a book with the humor of David Sedaris. the prose of Pat Conroy and the storytelling ability of Anne Rivers Siddons all wrapped up in one. This book has it all. A must-buy!"
3,A forgettable but fun read,"OK, this book has lot of editorial mistakes. I won't spend time listing them as previous reviewers already have. But why not take it for what it is-- a light-hearted, feel-good summer book that, at the end, will make you smile? It is funny and touching and entertaining. Perfect escapist fun for the summer. Who said a fun read had to be perfect? Ligthen up!"
3,"O.K. in spots, not the greatest.","The protagonist bounces from one major life altering experience to the next without any real meaning or believability. In one paragraph she finds out she's going to die. Very shortly after, she's robbing the bank she worked in. Then BAM, she's off to Hollywood. Then, lets go to Vegas.I found most of the secondary characters, like the police who are after her, unbelievable. And everyone she meets, a bartender in New Orleans, an old lady neighbor in L.A.---they all dole out sappy sweet advice as if they were pulled out of Oprahs' greenroom. I did like the premise, discovering how to be content in your own skin, and the plot was fine. Worth a read if you want something positive and mellow"
3,chicklit plus.....,Charlotte Clapp was given the worst news...she was only going to have a year to live! What is a girl to do who has not been outside of the small town she grew up in? She has always been reliable and caring and now she needs to make a change in her life before it runs out. Charlotte decides to rob the bank she has worked at for many years and she gets out of town to chase her dreams. She has always wanted to go to Hollywood and so her travels take her there and she meets some unlikely friends and learns a lot about herself and what she is capable of.For a first time author this was a delightful read and a fun escape for the reader.
5,Very good first novel!,"I just finished reading Night Swimming and found it to be verythought provoking, good story line and different from the averagefirst novel. I think a person looking for a light, yet good story to read will enjoy it immensely. Can't wait for her nextbook."
4,Self Introspect,"It's interesting how everyone interprets a read differently. I really enjoyed this book and the introspect it provided in regard to self awareness, self worth, the value we put into other people that we don't give ourselves the courtesy of. I thought this was a light, easy, cute read and found myself giggling at a few parts in this book that I couldn't help but to LOL at."
4,Decent if not realistic,"I like the book although it did take a few chapters to get to the meat and potatoes. Skip was a wonderful character and a man I wish I had! The maturity that Charlotte ""Blossom"" shows is immense and allows you to possibly see a little bit of yourself in her. She broke away from the pack as a character allbeit a bit unrealistic but none the less a good read. Some chapters I thought could probably have been taken out. There were some pages I skipped because I knew it was filler...filler is pointless to read. Good book, am actually reading it again."
2,The moral of the story............,Life is tougher when you are a size 18 than it is when you are a size 8. It doesn't take 341 pages to say it.
1,Absolute waste of time and money!!,"I hesitate to give this even 1 star. I read the reviews and decided that it is something that I would like. What a waste! This book is so full of crap that I can't believe someone would write this and expect its readers to like. Who can buy a million dollar house in CASH?? Why such a hokey name like Blossom McBeal?? Who tells their boyfriend to go out with their best friend? When Blossom/Charlotte is in jail, is there no survelience monitors? Who talks about jumping bail in a rec room of a jail? Is there no supervision or cameras is this jail??Bottom line, pick something else....anything else would be better than this crap I was stupid enough to buy."
4,Thought Provoking,"Although the ending is a bit far fetched and ties up too nicely, the book itself was a fascinating thought-provoking read. I almost didn't read it at all after the first couple of pages thinking the book would be a true downer, but in the end I thoroughly enjoyed it and wholehardedly recommend it to any woman in her late twenties that is contemplating life and it's meaning."
3,not bad for a first-time writer,"While I wanted to give this book 4 stars, the dialogue between Charlotte and Dolly prevented me from doing so. That part of the book was the only flaw i could find. I did think Skip and ""Blossom"" had some chemistry, but their conversations sounded like first graders talking on a playground. I did like the book overall, and will read RS next offering."
1,Hated it,"I read some reviews on this book and thought the plot sounded very interesting. A woman who has been mistakenly told she has one year to live, so i thought it would be interesting to see what she would make of her time left. But when i read that first chapter i should have stopped there. This book just went from one horrible chapter to the next. It still makes me made just thinking about how everything ended, so unbelievable. I plead with you not read this book. It really deserves a 0."
4,What would you do?,"Charlotte Clapp is given a year to live. What has she done with her life? She does a quick appraisal of her 34 years living in Gorham, New Hampshire. Overweight, alone, and miserable; she steals two million dollars from her bank and goes on the run. She re-invents herself as Blossom McBeal. Charlotte ends up in Hollywood, California intent on living the rest of her life with no regrets. She takes up swimming as her passion and loses all the extra weight. Charlotte finds a friend in her neighbor 82 year old widow Dolly Feingold; and develops a major crush on the pool boy Skip Loggins. Charlotte is found and brought back to New Hampshire. She discovers that the last year was the best year of her life. Some up and downs in the writing but overall an inspiring message for all women who struggle to find happiness."
4,"Breaker 1-9, Dale Watson is the baddest - you copy?","It doesn't matter if you don't know anything about trucking. This is real honky-tonk country music. There's no airbrushing, no poofy hair, no designer cowboy hats, no rewritten 70s California folk rock songs passing themselves off as ""country."" Wussies who dig Shania Twain, Garth Brooks, and other such pale milkweeds are advised to stay away; this stuff will be too strong for your blood. This is country as it was meant to be. Songs about women, coffee, and truckin', dang it. As completely honest and out-of-style as Dale's hair-tonic endowed haircut and the tattoo of the state of Texas on his arm.If you're sick of these poseurs with their fake fluffy pop passing themselves off as ""country,"" climb into the cab with Dale, fire up, and get rollin', friend. It'll do your heart good."
4,"Superb music for your next drive, physical or metaphorical","Watson's baritone purrs and rumbles, his telecaster climbs through the gears, and His Lone Stars roll out the road rhythms that pace this celebration of all things truckin'. Fourteen originals wind from the lure of the road and the longing for home to breakdowns and break-ups, CB lingo and coffee, coffee, coffee. The spirits of Dave Dudley, Red Sovine and C.W. McCall appear like black dogs in the headlights.Recorded in a single 7-hour session, these two-steps and ballads sound fresh from the stage of Roadhouse, USA. This CD adds four tracks to the original cassette issue, giving you 15 extra miles before spinning it again.Take it on your next haul to Shaky City, or a quick flip on the freeway."
5,Ruben at his best,"This album, although it may be short is exceptional. It is classic Ruben Blades at his best. Most of these songs cannot be found on his other CD's, which make this a must get. It is a great collection of classic salsa and adapted bolero songs which I definitely recommend..."
4,Holds up quite well with his best (and better-known) works.,"This 1984 release was the first of several Ruben Blades studio albums which Fania Records put out after he signed with Elektra Records. Although comprised of ""rejects"" which were deemed unworthy of being released while Ruben was still a Fania artist I must say that six of its seven tracks are superb. By itself, Ruben's guaguanco callejero remake of the Jose Alfredo Jimenez ranchera classic ""El Corrido Del Caballo Blanco"" makes this CD worth buying while ""Amor Pa' Que"", ""Ya No Te Puedo Querer"" and ""Noe"" rank right up there with his best late-1970s recordings. Buy while you can!"
4,Móa - Joy & Pain (Don't You Believe Me),"So on the remixes of Móa's JOY & PAIN, Victor Calderone offers his club version, which strips out the jazzy elements of the original in favor of more generic high-energy diva-based stomping (his dub eliminates her vocals altogether, except for some digitized whispering). Dimitri from Paris, on his ""French Touch"" mix, retains more of the original feel, while introducing some dancefloor-friendly breaks (his ""Joy & Beats"" mix has a more solid 4/4 beat). Terranova gives her a darker, slower rub, and the moodiness suits the track well, focusing more on the 'pain' part of the title."
3,Elgato EteTv 250,"This started out bad - they sent my package to the wrong address. Finally got it. Have had trouble with picture freezing and audio not coming up when starting the application. It took their Support 2 days to respond to my quesitons. Now they want me to return it at my expense for a replacement - not the RMA process I am used to wtih other good companies. When it does work it is fine, although remote is pretty difficult to understand."
5,Awesome product,"Great little device for watching TV and especially for importing VHS tapes into the Mac. I use it as a TiVo recording movies from HBO, etc. With one click they are recorded and transfered to iTunes and synced with my iPod for viewing on the road.Two thumbs up!!"
4,Works but is expensive.,"The Eye TV 250 worked great for connecting my Mac Mini to a 20"" HD TV in my bedroom. The ability to ""pause"" live TV is great. Good software as well. But only 4 stars because it is expensive. I actually returned it and bought a Eskape/Hauppage My TV.PVR which I was able to get for $99. I feel the My TV.PVR is just as good as the Eye TV, although not as well known, and cost me $100 less."
4,works fine,"My first Elgato, purchased 2 years ago, has been working fine. Although it would not change to the correct channel for recording scheduled programs. I replaced it with the Elgato 250 which has zero-latency for use with video games. The variable screen aspect ratio to play movies in wide screen has been appreciated. The recording quality appears to be better as well. Being a much smaller unit gives more options in placing it out of the way.The remote works fine, but since I sit close enough to the computer to use the onscreen controls, I rarely use the remote. I already have too many other remotes as it is."
4,"Works well, build quality a bit low","Overall I gotta say this was a very nice purchase. The software integrates well with Mac OS X and setup was easy. Dinged it a bit on build quality. Also I use this to primarily watch TV on my computer not as a true DVR for my entertainment system so I can't speak to the quality on a larger screen. However, if you like to work on your computer and have a bit of TV now and then this is perfect."
3,bellydance,i don't like to workout so this is a good distraction while doing the right thing. the movements are made simple enough for me to imitate the moves and feel the burn
3,DVD,"IT HELPED ME TO LOSE WEIGHT, AND IT IS REALLY GOOD FOR FOOD DIGESTION,THE FOOD RUNS THROUGH THE BODY QICK. FIVE MINUTES A DAY IS EVEN ENOUGH.AND IT IS MORE GENTLE THAN DOING SIT-UPS OR AFTER A CESAREAN, IT IS LESS PAINFUL.FOR STIFF PEOPLE, THIS WILL HELP TO LOSEN UP AND BEGINNER'S LEVEL IT IS GREAT TOO ALSO."
5,Great Bag,"I use this bag to transport my Nikon Coolpix when I don't need to use the slave flash attachment or for my Flip Mino HD camcorder. Each item fits perfectly and protects very well as it is waterproof and well padded. I like the shoulder strap and belt buckle options. The belt buckle is extremely secure so if you bend over the case does not fall off. If you need a small camera bag that is dependable, this is it."
3,"Half the book is a failure, but I suppose that's the point.","David Schmidtz starts the first half of this book with the most awkward, beat around the bush, euphemistic reframing of good old fashioned teleological social darwinism. Robert Goodin then swoops in and destroys his argument piece by piece. Worth a read to see how Libertarians continue to fail after Nozick!"
3,Robin Hood & Fabulous Fables,"Animation is old style, but OK. Stories are really ""sanitized"" and lame. My kids will watch about anything and enjoy it...but they are bored with this."
3,hookers,"good headers, but the quality is less than great for the money spent. Port matching consisted of poorly die grinding the heavily welded port, there is at least one pin hole in the weld you can see light through, exaust leak. I have bought many sets of hookers in the past, this was the worst for welding/final inspection."
3,It leaves you hungry,"Although the reader may initially forgive the lead character's desire to skirt the memories of tragic actions, eventually it only leaves one with the sense that the character lacks genuine depth. Not a satisfying experience."
4,Very good,"Through accident and arrangement we follow Fergus, a teenaged exile of the Great Hunger through Ireland, into England and ultimately, painstakingly, into the eastern U.S. in the middle of the 19th century. This is a sad story, but also a hopeful one and the little islands of lyricism in this novel remind us -- sometimes gently, sometimes bracingly -- how this is a moral tale, the morality of survival and, for many of his cohorts and lovers, the morality of not surviving."
2,Law of Dreams?,"ARGH!Depressing, explicit descriptions of death, violence, cruelty to animals and people, betrayal and hopelessness.... Only because it was my book club's selection did I finish this book."
1,The law of sex an violence. If it bleeds it leads. Too bad.,"If it bleeds it leads. Sensationalism at its worst. Painful novel to read but forced myself to finish. Yuck??? Have heritage and have studied history of this era and region from the best of Harvard professors. This fiction was filled with far too much blood and sex. Not a good read, actually somewhat insulting for those with Irish background."
4,Flawed but brilliant,"This book annoyed me intensely at first. Behrens has only the faintest grasp of what Ireland was like in famine times. The Catholic Church does not seem to exist, for one thing, and people take a remarkably relaxed view of extra-marital sex. (In fact, at no time in the book do any of these Irish Catholics ever go to Mass.) The dialect of English they speak, while vaguely 'Oirish' and picturesque, is not one I've ever heard spoken in Ireland, and the Gaelic quoted is frequently incorrect. The attack on the landlord's house is absurdly melodramatic, and that almost finished it for me. But having nothing else to read at the time, I persisted, and I'm glad I did. For the fact of the matter is that Behrens is a fine writer, and he tells a gripping tale."
5,Not long enough,"I've found a few books in my life (I'm 63) that I hated to see end, ""The Law of Dreams"" is one of those few. From start to finish I was enthralled with the characters and their plight. This is a keeper that I will re-read many times. The ending was wonderful, however I really hated to see it end-I wanted more. If you enjoyed such great novels as Michener's ""Centennial"", you'll love this great read."
5,Excellent,I'm going to agree with the other 5 star reviews on this book. It's an excellent reference.The book is well organized and the artwork and photography are excellent.
2,Could be better,"Unlike people that have reviewed this book, I didn't care for it. There are drawings instead of pictures and I couldn't make sense out of most of them. I was disappointed and would not recomend it."
5,Awesome,"So many books show the woodworker bent over the project instead of the actual pieces of the project coming together. This book shows detailed, helpful pictures of each step of the many different joints. The spiral-bound format makes it ideal for the shop -- you can lay the book down and have your hands free for working. This is by far the best guide I've seen for joinery."
3,Doesnt fit the description,"This book may be used as a quick reference guide or provide a brief introduction to joint work but it lacks detailed explanations for the beginner. It is full, however, of interesting joints of all types. I, as a beginner, would not tempt to perfom many of these without training or several practice attempts. If you have an understanding of woodworking this would be a great little book to keep on your shop shelf. Not entirely dissatisfied but it wasnt what I expected."
5,great book!,"Well organized and thorough! My husband, who is hard to please, loved this book. He says the organization is great. The spiral binding allows him to keep it open on his work bench. The book has lots of illustration which 'shows' not just 'tells.'"
1,Broke after 2 uses - don't buy,"As the other reviewer stated, the seal appears to be faulty on this, and it stopped working almost straight away. I have seen many other bad reviews of this product as well."
3,"Great idea, but can stand improvement","When this item arrived, I kept getting some strange items on the display. After some wrangling, I deduced that the battery that it shipped with was kaput. I replaced the battery, and I perceived that it worked fairly well. The product took one little fall from the edge of the tub to the floor tile and the display cracked. I would have hoped the thing could have been a bit sturdier, and perhaps it was a freak occurrence that it broke from such a meager tumble. I'll give MOBI the benefit of the doubt and grant it 3 stars instead of the one star I initially intended to for just that reason (that perhaps I was unlucky enough to have a 'one in a thousand' dud)."
3,"OK for beginners, for advanced users it might not be that great...","I bought this DVD mostly because of the featured arms workout. It's OK for me, but I have to say that -again- for advanced users it might not be that great. It's not a strong workout, but it could be an ideal one for those days that you just don't feel like working out. Mari has gotten way too talkative on her last DVD's, so if you don't like this just put on music and the workouts will go on really fast. (It would be better if she talked while doing the exercises) The option about you creating your workout it's really the biggest feature of this DVD, in my opinion of course."
1,Frustrated,"I like her workout regimines except on most of them, including this one, she talks too long explaining the exercise. My legs are hanging in mid-air while she gives detailed direction. The exercise is hard enough without having to ""pause"" in mid-air while she explains. I have several Mari Winsor Pilates DVDs and she does this on most of them. It usually only takes me one or two workouts to get the exercises on my own. The slow commentary ruins the workout for me."
3,Not so sure...,It's four 10 min workouts. It focuses on your core in each. I do it because it's good for me but I'd rather be lifting weights!!!
1,not for begginers,"I tried to do this video several times but since i've never done pilates it was extremely difficult. I eventually gave up. Now i do bellytwins dvds which are easier for me. Don't thumbs down because i said that. It's just that pilates isn't for everyone, especially this dvd."
5,"Great Item, Great Price!","I got these for two of my adult son's for Christmas and one for my husband. Every pick up or Jeep driver needs a good tow strap and this is a good one. My oldest son said it was the gift that kept on giving because he had several opportunities to use it on Christmas Day. We live in Oklahoma and had a white Christmas and people here don't know how to drive when the roads are slick, so many end up stuck on the side of the road. My son went out to test his strap and pulled out several such drivers and had a great time doing it."
5,Excellent used it within days once our first snowstorm hit!!,Received it and not even a week later had to use it to pull out my plow truck after a big storm hit. Worked tremendous would highly recommend to anyone well worth the investment!! Item arrived quickly with my 2 day prime shipping very happy with my purchase do not hesitate not a cheap product!!
3,"Plodding, difficult reading.","This is a pedantic biography, which never really comes to life. There is a lot of detail about imperial society and the people making it up. However, Hadrian, although the central personage, remains rather vague, maybe because there is little hard information about him. A disappoinment compared to Birley's boigraphy of Marcus Aurelius"
2,very dry,"The book was so dry and boring, I never became interested in Hadrian through the whole book. The book was a detailed chronology of his life, but only the events. His life as a whole wasn't pulled together. I finished the book without a better understanding that I started with."
3,James Bowman CD,"The quality of the CD is good, but the condition of the CD case came with a large crack through the center."
5,A lot of story in a little book,"I've only just 'discoverd' Ms. Smith's books, with BE MY BRIDE? the first one I've read. I was amazed at the amount of emotion and meaty story the author packed into the slim volume. I especially loved the characterization of Cody and Lauren. Both emerged as people I would really like to know in real life.By the time I finished the book, Ms. Smith became my newest auto-buy author and I picked up most of her backlist at my local UsedBookStor. At the moment, I'm currently reading her latest release, TALL, DARK AND TRUE. Suffice it to say, it has not disappointed yet.If you haven't read any of Ms. Smith's books, I'd advise you to start with BE MY BRIDE? I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3,"Interesting, well researched, but dry","This is an amazingly intellectual book. The endnotes have 1,052 entries with some annotation. Little wrote a well thought out and organized book and has a lot of good points, but it is incredibly dry. I had the fight through this book and my short attention span did not go well with it. However, if you need to have good solid research and looking for a secondary source this is perfect."
4,ANOTHER LOST ALBUM,"Remember ""STANDING ROOM ONLY""? An album, even with a catalouge number, supposed to be released sometime in 1972. This is it! Here are the studio and live tracks that would have been included in that album. This is what ""should have been"" at the time. Instead most fans shook their head over ""BURNING LOVE AND HITS FROM HIS MOVIES VOL.2"" Here are excellent concert performances from Elvis in Vegas '72. And also the studio recordings from march the same year. Overall a very nice album. I really did this!"
5,It's a shame this book is out of print,"This book is a great adventure about a group of gamers who go on an elaborate adventure in a futuristic theme park akin to, say, the holodeck. The hero is forced to join up when a real murder occurs. The details are fantastic, a great blend of Carribean mythology and American history. Great, fun reading if you can find it."
4,Nice story - Interesting idea,"This was more of a fantasy story that was made possible by future technology, wrapped around a mystery. Good story, and I think I will partake in the sequels."
5,Gamers,"I have read and reread this book several times and have always enjoyed it. In fact, I had to tape the cover back on my paperback copy. I guess I'll need to find a new one in better condition. The one thing in this book that most people seem to miss is a paragraph on page 232. It mentions Gamers internationally playing an on line game. In 1981 that was completely impossible since no regualar civilian had any access to the World Wide Web, if it even existed. Also, the mention of flat screen monitors...once again, no such thing existed. If you have an imagination and enjoy fun fantasy, and a murder mystery thrown in, you'll enjoy this book. It's timeless."
2,Overrated,"I have nothing against SF, and I am a roleplayer myself. I even own (and like) the Dreampark RPG.In fact, I was eager to find this in paperback, because a lot of people seem to rate it highly both as adventure fiction and for its portrayal of role playing and roleplayers.I was severely disappointed. The characters are pretty wooden, and the world itself is pretty unconvincing. The authors try to convince us that the ""Game"" is a big thing, carrying huge monetary gains for TV rights and novelization, but I really fail to see how public could really be interested in this.The attempts to make us sympathize with the players and seeing how they are so engrossed in it to actually care more for the game itself than the rest of the world are pretty unconvincing, too, and the story seems flat and forced in more than a place.Characters' psychology is probably not a forte for Niven, but unfortunately all the SFX razzle dazzle fail to carry the story... just like an Hollywood action film, in fact."
2,Did not work,This item did not work for me at all. I hooked the item up and nothing caused my network to drop. I have Verizon FIOS so I am going to take a guess this wasn't for me. Figured I would give it a try.
5,Broadband booster,"I purchased the Hawking Broadband Booster (HBB1)last month and when I received it I read the instructions and quickly installed it and from what I can see it has sped up downloads significantly as promised. Now all I have to do is put in a 'n' router and see the improvement on my laptop which I use most to all the time. Good product, does what it advertised and price was right also, well worth it."
4,OK but there is room for improvements,"I connected the device and it works. It shapes the upload bandwidth to prioritize time sensitive data transfers, like Voice over IP.The problem I found was that after a day or two it caused my connection to fail for some unknown reason and I had to cylce my cable modem, the Hawkings HBB1 and my router to get back online."
3,No big difference/Minor gripe,"My wife and I have 3 meg DSL Pro from SBC in the San Francisco area. She works from home and VPN's to several clients. I occasionally work from home and VPN to my office. In addition she sometimes uses a VoIP phone for one of her clients. I had noticed considerable slowdowns on our network. I'm hardwired to a netgear wireless g router, she's wireless. The router & DSL modem are on 7x24. My PC's off when not in use. 75% of the time when I boot, I get a message on IE saying ""Broadband Booster is measuring your connection..."", and wait 2-3 minutes before I can browse, or retrieve email. On the bright side, the congestion has been cleared up to some extent. I can have my PC streaming from Music Match, have my work laptop VPN'd and have my wife also VPN'd and it all goes pretty fast.I would not spend the $ just thinking it would improve my browsing. If you're an online gamer it might be a good tool, but I don't really game online."
4,Seems to improve network lag,"I purchased this ""broadband booster"" for a network of 10 PC's and VOIP to see if some of the lag experienced by some of the network users would decrease. After a few days of testing, this device seems to do what it's supposed to do though I'm sure my network didn't improve by the advertised 400%.One major gripe concerns the preliminary network check that the broadband booster automatically runs when you open Internet Explorer for the first time. The check seems to take about 3-4 minutes, which may be a problem if you want to start surfing the internet right away. Other than this annoyance, the device is a decent value for the money."
3,"Speeds a lot, but severly slows my upload speeds","I've had one of these between my modem and router for years. I forget it's even attached. Well, today I changed from a slow DSL connection to a speedy cable connection, and decided to try a couple of tests uploading and downloading a few big files to an FTP site and see how the Broadband Booster would affect the speeds. It seems that the Broadband Booster usually sped the download time by a little, but it ALWAYS severely SLOWED my upload speeds. I'm talking slowing the time of a 3 minute upload to 8 minutes when it was connected! So my assumption is that the Broadband Booster speeds the negotiation of a lot of random internet traffic, but if you need to focus on uploading a lot of data, I think you'll wish you didn't have the Hawking Broadband Booster connected."
3,A copper bracelet for your home network.,"This device seems to have improved the voice quality of my VOIP calls and that's why I bought it. So why only three stars? Maybe I'm a little disappointed that I didn't have to waste the better part of a day tweaking it; it worked out of the box, just like the documentation and marketing literature said. I'm also not 100% convinced that this little box does anything at all, but it doesn't give me any trouble and it's cheaper than QoS from my broadband provider."
2,Sad faces (where is Buckethead?),"Praxis is a band that doesn't stand still. Each album is different from the last with no 2 being alike. Mold is no exception. Gone are the classic members Bootsy, Bernie, Brain Yamatsuka, and Buckethead(the reason I like Praxis). Instead what we have here is Bil Laswell and a team of people Ive never heard of, playing techno music. Not the dance techno, electronic is a better description. Fans of Transmutation and Metatron may want to leave this one off their lists. This one is more like 1984 completed and a little bit of Warsazwa. NO SHRED HERE! NO PHAT BRAIN BEATS OR BOOTSY LICKS! The two stars are for the tracks Electric Soil and Sqlxzm which are the only standouts from the 2 times Ive listened to this cd since i bought it Friday (its monday now). Electric Soil is part of a qoute from Beethoven so it has a beethoven feel. With my Prtaxisw collection almost complete I am glad to have this but money could be much better spent."
3,It's too late!,"Anyone ordering this video will probably be helped......however, the biggest help would be to warn people to NEVER buy a KENMORE ANYTHING. The appliances are junk and the service.....well, let's just say.... There is service, but even on warrantied parts you will pay out the wazoo! Please warn friends and family to stay clear of Sears when ordering household appliances."
3,"Fania All Stars ""Salsa"" Soundtrack","Este album contiene la banda sonora o soundtrack de la pelicula Salsa de la Fania All Stars. Contine varias canciones que puedes encontrar en los CDs de Fania All Stars ""Live At Yankee Stadium"" I & II, Fania All Stars ""Latin~Soul~Rock"" y Mongo Santamaria ""Live at Yankee Stadium"". Lo peculiar de este disco es que algunas de las canciones como ""El Raton"" y ""Bemba Colora"" contiene algunos pedacitos que fueron editados en los discos antes mencionados. Ademas el disco incluye un tema que solo se encuentra en esta produccion: ""Julia"" de El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico grabado en vivo como parte del tumultuoso concierto de la Fania All Stars en el Yankee Stadium. Estos detalles hacen de este CD uno para coleccionistas."
2,awkward,"I was disapointed. The rake was rather heavy, and awkward. However, I could have lived with this, but the rake simply doesn't pick up enough leaves to make it worthwhile. When you ""close"" the rake, most of the leaves are forced out. I returned the rake. The good news is that the Amazon return process is really slick."
3,Back saver,"The rake works fine, wish it would pick up more leaves thanit does. It does save one from bending down less, so it doessave ones back to a great degree."
4,It is a great movie as well as a great sound track,"This sound track shows the beauty of anchient and historical nation of Ethiopia. It takes you to the world of wonders and paradize. Offcourse the music stresses the harsh and the struggle of life in East Africa specially Ethiopia. I have been there so I know the beauty as well as the misery of Ethiopia. By any standard, this is the most civilized and dignified nation I ever visited. Enjoy the sound track of Engurance!"
3,It's a romantic Tamil Movie,"Kadhal FM movie is about the radio jockey Mani (Manikandan) with Suryan FM. For a live-in programme hosted by him, he has fans calling from all over Chennai. One such is Ruchika (Shivani Singh), a college student. She falls in love with Manikandan's voice and she expresses her love to him. Manikandan too reciprocates."
3,Expected more from Uchida,"While this is my first exposure to Uchida's Beethoven, I've been a big fan of her Mozart recordings for a long time. I've heard many, many recordings of the 111, and have been looking for a passionate as well as precise reading in modern sound. Unfortunately, this disc falls short--I can't quite tell if the muddled tone is more due to the recording or musician, but there are a number of points in the 111 where Uchida is stretched technically beyond what she can deliver--timings suffer, which gets in the way of me being able to enjoy the work.You can definitely do better--in stereo, Pollini and Kovacevich shine in these works (giving Pollini the slight edge in technical ability, and Kovacevich in passion), or if sound quality isn't as important get Solomon's set on EMI."
3,NOT ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE,"I've heard Uchida many times, just last month for example. She is terrific in live perfomances, but on record, for some reason she is a little lame. This is, how should I say it, BOHHHRRRINNNNNGGGG!And as sacrilgious as it may sound, opus 109, and 110 are not 'transcendental', but just ordinary pieces of music. If they were not Beethoven's they would not be given much shrift.Not to get on another subject, but a lot of writing about Beethoven is 'The White Man's Burden' type nonsense."
5,The Best of the Girl-Groups,"I love vol.2 Poodle Skirts & Poni-Tails. Hearing girl-group sounds of years ago..how sweet the innocence of the lyrics and music..this is a winner!!! The Dories.Chiffon's and The Delicates..how terrific to have them all in this neat cd..I also have vol.1 and vol.3..These are a MUST if you love the songs and sounds of these pioneer groups who started it all!!!!DF,FL."
1,Bleah,"Main reason I bought this was for ""Insane in the Brain"". Unfortunaetly, it's a horrible remix. The rest of the songs are all crappy '90's pop songs which, for the most part, I avoided trying to hear during the '90's."
5,brmahon,Bought this for my neighbor boy to put up in his room...he loved it. Hasn't put it up yet...but will after they've re-painted his room.
4,Good Decal Set,"We were nervous before buying this but once it arrived, my wife put it togther within a hour and it looks great. Decals stick great to the wall and can be moved with no problem. Some decals were folded from how it was packaged but they seem to stick almost as well as all the other decals. Great product"
1,Jos Poell toasts are terrible,"Rather than packed tightly and stacked to minimize breakage, these toasts are packed loosely in bags inside their cartons. The result is that 10 or so toasts are whole, the remainder is a jumble of broken toasts and crumbs, totally useless for serving. This was true of each package. Do not buy."
3,Something is missing...,"Very kind person, and a quick transaction, but the camera has some parts which doesn't work properly, like the memory stick slot... and the Drivers CD is missing and I cannot connect the camera to the PC, and it was difficult to download them by internet."
3,Emma,The book was good but I had a problem keeping my interest. I don't know if I would recommend this book. It took a long time to get into it and then it lost my interest.
5,Awesome!,"I had trouble putting this one down! To anyone who might enjoy a Christian Historical book full of occasional comical characters and inspirational schemes and themes, this book is for you!"
4,Enjoyed reading this.,Enjoyed this book! It has a great story line. Since it is an inspirational book I did not have to worry about the language. That is awesome! I will look forward to reading the next one in the series.
3,Left hanging.,Plot was ok. I did not like the fact that the author chose not to provide the reader with closure regarding ownership of the house. Is there a sequel?
2,Could not get into it,I don't know why but I just couldn't get into the story. After about 40% into the book I finally just gave up and closed it down. I still have it in my Kindle but believe me I will read everything else I have first and the. Might even pay for more books before I try to read it again.
4,What a Delight to Read,"A Hearth in Candlewood (The Candlewood Trilogy, Book 1)was a delightful read. Finally a book about a mature, intelligent woman and how she handles the challenges life sets before her through prayer and friendship. The heroine is Emma Garrett, a widow who seeks to provid a future for herself and the dear friends God places in her life. The author, Delia Parr, grabs her reader's interest from the very start. I'm looking forward to settling down with the next installement in this series."
4,A Hearth in Candlewood,This book was an enjoyable read. It flowed smoothly and characters were likeable. I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the trilogy.
3,Perdictable,It was very nice. But not the exciting book that I like to read. I loved old butter the dog.
4,Fun read,"It was a good and fun read! It was easy to get to know and love the characters. It was funny, heart warming and Godly. I really liked it."
2,Slow,"I enjoyed the story of faith and resilience, but it was slow. This was a book I started and had to put down because the story took forever to develop. I finally picked it up again to finish it only to find out that the underlying storyline wasn't resolved. Well written but disappointing."
4,Enjoyable,"While this was an easy to read book (didn't require a lot of thought), it was entertaining and enjoyable. The characters were likable and well developed. Many of the side stories were amusing and brought a smile to my face. And while the story ended with enough closure to leave me satisfied, it also left just enough mystery to make me look forward to reading the next book in the series."
2,Glad it was free,"This book was exceedingly boring to me. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. If I wanted to learn more about canals, I would read a book specifically dedicated to them. Additionally, I felt that it was unrealistic to surmise that the people of this era would be intimidated by a single chicken."
5,Strength and Courage Prevails!,This book was really a great book because it showed how the perseverance of one person could affect a whole community of people. There is much to be learned about life...and how it can be strengthened by tragedy...by reading this book.
4,Good read,"I have enjoyed reading this book so far, haven't completely finished it, but it's been a interesting book so far."
2,Just too slow,"I like a clean book, I like historical, I don't require a hot romance. Yes...I like reading about faith in action. But come 'on--there has got to be some degree of excitement, adventure. The book had several possibilities, but the author failed to infuse the level of emotion necessary to make the read enjoyable. I was bored and the read was forced after about the first one third."
5,LOVED THIS TRILOGY!!,"I first downloaded this book to my Kindle as a freebie. I enjoyed it SO much..but thought that I would not pay for the others in the trilogy. So I went on and read another book..but I found that I missed the characters and the operation of Hill House badly. I HAD to read the rest of the story. I am glad that I did. I hated to see the third book end. I recommend this trilogy highly. Delia Parr brings Emma and all of the Hill House characters to life in such a way that they stay with and entertain you. If you haven't read the trilogy, please do..it's a wonderful read."
2,Christian Values? Not in My Bible,"As a charming little book, this book would be very good. As ""Christian"" literature it is ultimately disturbing. I was enjoying it until the end. The actions bring about the plot's climax and solve some of the heroine's problems are like those that used to disturb me when Samantha the Witch did them on Bewitched - which always ended with the characters acting out a lie or coming up with an untruth to explain unpleasant truth. The acting out a lie and implying others used by Emma the Christian were even more disturbing to me."
1,Too much silliness and triteness,"When I got to this sentence: ""Emma looked down at her own waistline and noted that despite her love of breads of any type, she managed to keep a trim figure"", I closed the book for good. Puh-leaze. Is that the best we can get with character development? I couldn't get any farther. What does it take to find a good, engrossing storyline?"
5,A hearth in candlewood,I enjoyed reading it. Can't wait to read the next two in the series. You seem to be a citizen of Candlewood.
4,wonderful book,My sister recommended this book and it is wonderful! I don't have much time for reading and am happy to have this available on my kindle that is on my phone. Easy to pick up where I left off.
5,I really enjoyed this book!,This is a great Christian book. I would recommend it for anyone who is tired of the trash that is out there now.
4,A Hearth in Candlewood,"This book was an unexpected delight to read. I look forward to reading the other two in the trilogy. Historical in content, I learned a great deal about the early canals that brought goods and people to the northeast region of the country."
4,Trip back in time was fun,"I really liked the main character of this book, and would like to read the rest of the trilogy. It combined humor and sentiment in a sweet, old-fashioned way that was just the ticket for bed time reading. I also liked the mother-in-law and hope her character is developed further in subsequent books."
3,Boring,I confess I thought this book would have been better with an over 4 star rating. I found it rather boring. It was a sweet read but that is about all I can say about it. If you have nothing to do in life and want to waste time read this. Your time would be much better spent on a different book.
2,Gambling Voodoo,"John Patrick points out the obvious as his strategy for betting on a game, several times. He then tells you his real stategy for making money, which is a simple but flawed money management system, over and over and over. He annoyed me with stories of his ""friends"" with corny names like I.M. Stupid,I.M. Broke, and Lotta Cash on every page, but I got used to it by the middle of the book. I finished the book liking him and his colorful writing style, having known a more than a few characters like him, growing up here in Las Vegas. Breaking down his book it looks like this: useful handicapping advice 10% B+, Questionable money handling practices 30% D, stressing discipline in money 35% A, sometimes irritating but colorful stories as examples 25% B-, experience 100% B+."
1,John Patrick's gambling books are a waste,"Books on gambling theory should help you make money. His theories will not do that, since they lack a solid mathematical basis. Take a look at his book on Craps, or ""Beating Roulette!"" (I mention this, as professional gamblers do not try to beat Roulette with any system you can find in a book).Everything he puts out in any gambling topic is ""fast food"". His goal is to sell books, not to educate. If you are serious about studying sports investing, a good introductory text is ""Sharp Sports Betting"" by Stanford Wong (who is also a legitimate Blackjack author)."
3,missing pieces,"Its a dartboard, how can you mess that up? The folks at Halex have figured it out. The logo on the front of the cabinet is not the one in the picture. Instead of a subdued NHL logo, it is a bright white and orange one. There is mounting hardware, but it seems to be missing pieces and there are no instructions on how to put it together, just instructions on how to play darts. The Halex website offers no product support for anything produced before 2007, since this was made in 2006 I guess you have to figure it out on your own. Had I known that I would have spent the extra $ and got a better quality board."
5,THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE,"This sequel was worth the waiting. Although I was satisfied with the way the book ended. I still see room for a sequel. For some reason, I don't think RubyLee is done with Dr. vincent yet.Unfortunately, by the time Rubylee comes out of Jail she might have to deal with her grandson.This book was a perfect example on how lack of communication can affect a good relationship. As hard as it may be sometimes, it's better to open up and tell the truth.I think Earl Sewell is a great author. But unfortunately I don't think he's getting enough recognition."
3,Great photos,Really nice pictures but the text gets a bit redundant and doesn't go into a lot of detail other than the changes made from year to year. Worth the price for the pictures though.
4,Excellent Photos,"The photos are what makes this a four star book. The book has nice, but brief, text on Porsche history and racing.The book covers cars from the 60's through the late 90's 993. There is a short section on the water-cooled 996. One thing the book is missing is coverage of the 80's cars. The book goes right from the 60's-70's into special editions and the 993s.Overall the book is worth the price of admission because of the photos but don't expect much technical detail."
3,Incomplete coverage,"Yes, the pictures are good and the years and models that are covered are done well, but what about the late seventies and eighties models? There is a year-to-year change summary at the end of the book, but that's all there is for the missing years.It just seems like there is a chapter or two missing."
3,an okay older book on air cooled 911's,"This is an okay older book (this one published in 1999) that briefly describes major variants of Porsche 911's from the 901 prototype through the air cooled years up to the first year 996 water cooled model. Its a light read, not over technical or delving deeply into Porsche factory history. There are some nice photos and they cover some tuner 911 cars that most main stream Porsche books ignore. Overall, I would say its worth picking up a used copy for $5 for the 911 lover but I wouldn't pay retail for it to buy one new."
4,Interesting,"Liszt's transcriptions of song really shine with Schubert, and Leslie Howard's talents are more suited for the Schubert songs. The songs here aren't in the same league as Schubert's best, so if you want ""Liszt lied"" piano playing, check out Howard's many CDs of Schubert lied as transcribed by the master."
3,based on 2 weeks,this does a good job with my frozen waffles. i would not recommend this for elderly or non-computer people as the digal settings are a bit confusing but fine once you get the hang of it.the main drawback for me is the very loud beeping whenever you start to toast and then when it's done toasting. this thing is ridiculously loud and a problem for late night snackers like me. (louder than most microwave beeps) i don't think there's an easy way to disable the beeping.i know this is wrong but i just made bacon using the broiler and it came out great.....and not messy either (to my surprise)....however if you just want bacon the panini grills work great for that (i used the cuisinart griddler)i noticed that i could fit a pie shell in this oven so i tried baking a pumpkin pie. it worked out great. one minor problem was that the temp setting was off by about 75 degrees so you'll probably need to crank it up if baking.
4,Well worth the selling price,"This is toaster oven replaced my old 2 slice Black & Decker that was about 30 years old. I wanted one that could broil, toast, & large enough to fit a small casserole dish yet not take up much more space than my old one. This one does all that-most of the larger size is in the height & depth so the length of the counter space used is not too much more. I'm well satisfied with the performance & the price of the DeLonghi. The only negatives I've found are, like most larger ovens, the toast isn't as good as a toaster or a 2 slice oven; & the beep it makes when the time is up has an annoying tone to it."
3,Not child-proof even with older children,"We have only made toast a few times. The glass door gets extremely hot and could cause a severe burn if touched during toasting. The handle is curved inward, which places fingers close to the glass when the door is opened. The instructions do warn about the sides and glass becoming very hot, but we thought that applied to baking or use for something taking longer than just making toast. This will actually tend to heat the kitchen more in the summer when the A/C is on. Also the nine beeps when the toast is finished are very annoying."
4,excellent service/product,"Received the unit much sooner than promised. It works very well, but I would have liked more oven temperature settings. Temp settings are only available in 50 degree increments. Other than that, it is what I expected and does a good job."
2,Looks Better Than it Works,This toaster oven sucks. It seems to always be too hot and burns everything. Forget about getting croissant rolls to come out good. It has a very loud annoying beep. The buttons are hard to press and the toaster settings confusing. Really poor design. My old Black & Decker was way better. Sorry I bought it.
2,Sadly the beeping kills this for me...,"I saw another review that mentioned this, but I have to agree: the beeping is very loud and obnoxious and totally ruins this oven for me.Seems like it could be more intuitive but I'm ok with it for that, but I've called their tech support and they tell me the ""safety feature"" of the very high pitched and loud beeping cannot be turned off. To make toast, you will need to press 3 buttons at least (mode twice, then start) that will each cause a beep, and then multiple beeps when it is done. Plus additional beeps for each time you want to change the toast color. Setting something to cook for X minutes at X degrees is likely a dozen plus beeps.The beep would be annoying to me, but it scares my dog who runs upstairs and hides in a shower stall (I am not kidding). So for Christmas he will be getting a new quiet toaster oven, probably a Krupps..."
1,Obnoxious,"We love Toaster Ovens, but NOT this one. It looks great in our kitchen, and the digital part of it is cool, but it's going back to the store immediately. I was upstairs when my husband plugged it in the night we bought it, and I heard it. He stopped ""playing"" with it in fear it would wake up the babies. Everytime you push a button (or plug it in for that matter) it beeps, not just when it's done toasting. The high pitch tone may not be fun for those with hearing aids. I cannot tell you how well it performs, because the noise irritates us so much, we have not used it."
3,This is a so-so product for the money,"This is an OK product. I expected it to be a much better quality. It does the job...but I wouldn't say it's any better than a $30 toasted oven. I have heard so many great things about DeLonghi and will give them another try. However, I would pass this product in particular up if/when we need another toaster oven."
2,"Sounds good, but 5 sets broke","This is one of the best sounding strings on the market.The problem is, with 5 sets, the high ""e"" string broke when tuning.The string does not brake, it uncoils at the ball end, really strange.This happened with 4 sets when tuning, and with 1 set after a while playing."
4,decent but lasts only a week,"bright sounding, clear and aggressive tone. too bad it only stays bright for a week. Standard ernie ball strings lasts 2 and a half. Overall its ok strings."
3,Muy bueno!!!,Está bien el DVD lo recomiendo!!!Uno de los mejores conciertos de la Fania All Stars!!!Espero que sigan saliendo más DVDs!!!
1,This CD was not readable by my CD player,"Beware of this CD -- I tried two copies of it, and neither copy was readable by my relatively new, state-of-the-art player. Before this CD, the only CDs not readable by my player were ones that friends had burned for me. Hyperion's quality is hit-or-miss, so consider a different recording of Haydn's ""Harmonie"" Mass before plunking down nearly $18 for this one."
1,Good item but very bad company to deal with,i have to say this is a good product but to get it from this company its a very bad idea.the delivery is very late and you won't get your product on time. also they send it with fed ex and when you talk to fed ex people they'll be glad to refund the money but becuase you did not send this item they won't refund it to you and they company that send this item won't refund the money.so don't buy it from this company.
5,"I lost mine, now what?","I have ben using epilators since 1988. And 6 years ago I bought Gently Silken. It was easy to use and always did a great job. The worst part is, I have lost it somewhere(in my own house)and now I have to buy a new one. Do I pick a newer model or stay with the tried and true? I still hoping to find my old one,one can hope!!"
4,Not a bad investment,"I had this epilator for several years. After about 2 years or so, the battery begins to die on you and the charge won't last nearly long enough, but that's simply because the battery only has so many cycles, just like with computers.This one works well, but with time, maybe because my hair became too thin or maybe because the epilator got old, it wouldn't pick up the thin hairs as well. It did continue to work just fine on thicker hair.I've tried the more expensive Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epilator, but I found that it didn't work as well and I couldn't get it close enough to my skin.Overall, I'd buy this again if I was just starting out. I think it's a great buy for the price, but because my hair has become too fine, I need to look for a different brand.As far as pain goes, it will get better with time. I did waxing (since it's quicker) for some time at first until the hair become thinner."
2,Very slow,"I have used epilators for a long time and bought this when mine broke down after 10years. Thought i tried this since its cheap. My first comment is that it does the job but it takes a long time. Maybe its due to the number of tweezers on the head / the tweezers are quite far apart. I would have to run through the section a couple of times to get the hair out. I also have to do it very slowly so that i dont miss the hair. I have also tried moving it from left to right to increase the chances of the hair being grabbed. Overall, its quite inefficient, but i only do this every 3 weeks, so i can live with it. Not something i would recommend for regular users."
4,A Good Purchase,"This is the first epilator I have purchased. I went with this one because it is reasonably priced and I didn't want to invest too much in a product I might not like. In the future, I will likely purchase one with more tweezers to speed things up, this one takes a long time to do my legs. And the battery doesn't last very long, so it really has to be used with the cord. But overall I'm quite pleased with this product!"
2,Time consuming,"I bought this for my daughter, but having never used an epilator, I wanted to see what it's about. At first it does hurt a little, but you get over it pretty fast, depending on your tolerance. Make sure you read all the directions so that you use it correctly for best performance. It takes forever and no matter how long you're at it, it seems you can never get it all. By the time I got all the hair (over a several day period) it was growing back. To me, it seems a lot simpler and less time consuming to just shave your legs. Maybe a more expensive epilator would work better, maybe not, but I don't forsee myself using this for long..."
2,Not the best one ever,"I've had it for a year and it's still working. That's probably the only good thing I can say about it. It pulls one hair in 20 and that's after going over it for 5 times. It doesn't hurt, I'm used to them, but it simply doesn't work like it's supposed to. I have one bought in Europe which does miracles, but it doesn't work on 110V. So, I guess I'll be looking for something else to use home, this one was waste of money."
2,Emjoi Epilator,"I found the unit to be less than desired. It does work, but, because it misses more than it plucks, you need to spend a lot of time every day."
3,Meh,"Works okay. Takes forever to get everything off, and you have to exfoliate exfoliate exfoliate to make sure no hairs get ingrown unless you like digging hairs out of your flesh.This doesn't pinch as long as you keep the skin taught, and the areas that it does work on stays smooth for a loooong time.It sounds like an old rickety pencil sharpener when it gets going, and I was petrified to put it any where near my skin once I saw it start up, since it looked like a miniature meat grinder.But, once i got over it the whole 'ripping hair out of my legs thing' wasn't AS painful as I expected, but I was expecting something pretty painful. On the back of the legs and thighs, the pain made my hairs stand up so hey it worked better.The second pass wasn't nearly as painful.Not having to shave every day or so is definitely worth the initial 'ouch' factor and the hour or two or four that you have to spend to make sure you got everything."
2,this battery sucks,I have only used it TWICE with the cord and it already died... I couldn't use it without the cord because it would instantly die I am trying to see if I can get this replaced it is not worth the money
5,Awesome epilator for a bargain!,"This epilator is great! It plucks out my hair with a little bit of pain, but I can take that pain knowing the great results that will come out of it. My hair does not grow back in for at least another week. For this price, I highly recommend it. I'm buying a second one for my sister."
2,2 Stars for it..and I'm being NICE!,"1st CD HORRIBLE. I'm an MOS fan, really. HORRIBLE! The second c.d. was much better, but not enough to save the first one. Hard-core fans, avoid this c.d. at all cost!!!!"
1,Kept 3 songs,"Tons of trance, but for those with ""good"" taste, you won't want to buy this one. Out of both cds, i listen to only 3."
2,Save your money,This book just described what the manual did only using more words. The only thing I found it helpful for was finding out what are good fronts for illegal businesses. If I were you I would stick with what the designers wanted and find out how to play the harder way.
5,PHILLYS REAL TRUE HIP HOP HEADS,its a shame the group is no more because the first time i heard the album i was blown away. blown away so much that i got diamondback and nex millen(two snake members) to compose a track for my documentary. we shot a music video for it and featured kevin turner. we won best video of 1999 on the avenue video show. the snakes were real lyrisist and performers. the album has dope tracks and dark lyrics. a must hear for all hip hop purist.
3,Sony DCRTRV740,"I read the reviews about this camera and was a little hesitant because some of them mentioned it was noisy.I bought it anyway and was pleasantly surprised that it was not that noisy.I am quite a picky person about such things and I'm surprised someone could be dissatisfied with the camera because of the whirring.If you thought about not buying it because of that, don't worry.I just recieved mine so I still have to put it through its tests with the computer and so on. I just thought I would respond to the issue of the whirring noise."
3,Purchasing SD Card,"I purchased a 2G SD card to store more pics that the one that came with it. I put in the card and kept getting a ""card reader error"". The store indicated that the cam cannot handle the additional memory for storing pics. If anyone knows which SD card I can purchase to store more than the 40 pics, please let me know."
2,No Support for Server 2008,"I bought this card to go into a server that was being upgraded form Server 2003 to Server 2008 64-bit. It didn't mention that it supported 2008, but I was hopeful, since very few GigE cards are available now supporting the 64-bit edition of Server 2008. The hardware installs fine and the OS does detect it. However, no drivers exist to run it on 2008. I contacted USR support and they told me that they have plans to develop the proper drivers, but no ETA on them.To be clear, I'm not upset that this doesn't work with Server 2008 64-bit. USR doesn't claim that it does and I took a chance by trying. I'm writing this to let others like me (not afraid to experiment) know that this does not work yet.At this point, I can only give 2-Stars because I can't fully test the product. The support has been good and hardware installation went fine. In dealing with other US Robotics equipment, I have no doubt this card will work wonderfully with the proper drivers."
2,Really it's only for American practitioners,"This book offers interesting information, however is really only focused on consultancy, suppliers and America.As an Australian I found it to be a little removed from what is happening locally, plus, the examples were sometimes weak.For Americans, this would offer a good basis for Ethics / Etiquette however I would not rec this book to other international practitioners."
5,"Unfortunately, it never got used.","My wife ordered this product for our 18-year-old kitty, who was in advanced renal failure. He died before the shipment arrived."
3,Macroeconomics: Theories and Policies,"The book must have had some type of chemical or product spilled on it at some point in time. It smells horribly and if I read it for two long in one sitting, I get a headache. I'm not entirely sure what got on/in the pages, but it is pretty bad."
3,On time but not what I expected,Did not make clear it was the teachers review edition. Picture did not match the product.
2,"Ok, very boring","Caveat: I had to purchase this book as a graduate student in Economics at Johns Hopkins University.Bottom line boring, and only good if you have to use it in school."
4,Good Book!,The book was in new condition and I got it at a great price. I can't ask for more. Thanks!
1,Poorly made product!,This product is much too weak for the intended purpose -- a few few feet of the weather stripping had already essentially broken off when it arrived and it appears likely to fall apart during handling when installing.
2,Quite boring,"This DVD offers a few repetitive exercises. Music is quite boring and also very repetitive. Average production quality. Overall an effective, but very boring workout. Would not buy this again."
4,Good Beginner Book,"I have done pysanky for over 10 years, and have been asked where is a good place to begin. This book is my favorite to recommend. It offers a brief description of pysanky technique and uses. It touches on some of the highlights of this art. It gives a very cursory description of history and symbolism. (Most people don't share my interest in the history, so they don't mind how skimpy this section is) This book also gives the reader ideas of where to find inspiration like quilts, lace, etc. Overall, this is an excellent resource for the beginner."
5,Pysanky,"This is the best book. I love it, and I have borrowed it from the library for years, and finally found this copy to buy!! I do make pysanky, and have for years. This is a wonderful resource for anyone who does this art form, or wants to learn."
5,I'm a beginner,"This is a beautiful book. I bought it so that my children and I could get started in this art form. This book provides beautiful inspiration for the beginner, and has thorough instructions. There wasn't much info on dividing up the egg, but that information is easily found online, and not everyone wants a perfectly symetrical egg....especially children :)"
5,Best How-To Book,I've been purchasing instructional books for 15 years and this one is by far the best I've ever read. The instructions of the step by step process were clear and easy to follow. All my other friends that are interested in making these beautiful eggs are purchasing this book. I would highly recommend it's purchase.
3,Good idea but could be better,"The color choices are great and the idea of having its own attached pouch on the corner seems logical...on paper. However, I found the bag to be a little smaller than the plastic bags from the store.They are sturdy enough and you get what you pay for in quality. I would rather have a sturdy canvas bag that takes up more space in my vehicle than open an extremely wrinkled bag that doesn't hold much. It also tears somewhat easily when heavily packed and is packed with pointy, square boxes.I can fold my canvas nicely and stack them in one bag. It's much easier (for me) to have one bigger bag all together than a number of little puffy, crumpled bags. If you want to have a number of these in your purse, you better have a nice sized purse."
5,Loves it!,"I ordered these bags for an event hosted by my employer...almost took one for myself but decided not to. I finally ordered this bag and I love it! It's small enough to fit in a purse, and big enough for a bag of groceries!"
1,Definitely not worth the price.,This bags are not worth the price. You can buy more durable and better ones with a reasonable price at a local store.
4,Shpping Bag,"Sorry. I had to return the product because the bags were too small for me. Not the seller's fault, though."
3,dana what happened?,first i love bratz and also dana is one of my favorites but not this one she looks like sasha just purple and caucasian
2,Works.... like crap.,"I give this thing 2 stars only because it does work, however, sound quality is terrible, specially if you live in a building, high rise, or condo, where there can be multiple wireless routers transmitting. This thing actually uses the same channels as the routers and it makes the sound quality go to the floor, that or knocks out your wireless internet signal. So you are left with listening to broken sound, or ""clacks"" every other minute when the music is off.[...]I found Apple's Aiport Express with AirTunes a lot better in sound quality, although it takes some time to set up."
2,tons of annoying pops,"the thing gets tons of static electical charges and makes really annoying pops. I contacted startech customer support and got no response. the thing is barely usable with this current issue. If the pops weren't there, I'd be pretty happy with it. alas."
2,Not great.,"The unit is very easy to set up and small, but the quality isn't great. When it works, the sound is all right, but I'm transmitting almost-line-of-sight between 2 adjacent rooms, and sometimes I get annoying pops and silences. (Other times it works great; I haven't been able to figure out why it's sometimes okay.) I also can't get the speaker on the receiver end to pick up both R/L channels, but that might be a problem with my 1/8""-1/4"" adapter rather than the wireless. In any case, the AirLink is certainly not worth $60."
3,Virus Barrier X4,Too bad there's no way to automate the update process.I was surprised that it does not check my flash drive for viruses when I plug it in.
5,Can't go wrong with zippo.,"I got my roommate an engraved zippo lighter and got him a box of these. He has since quit smoking, but still uses it. They work wonderfully. Again, you can't go wrong with Zippo."
1,The picture is lying,There is just one wick inside. The picture is fake.The picture shows a cartoon of wick. But you just received one wick.
3,it's a wick.,"It's a zippo wick, not much to really talk about - it works, and it's easy to replace in the lighter."
3,over priced,"i guess its all good, but about twice what it should cost...Zippo Wicks, Individual Card"
3,Dog eats murderer,"The small French town of Concarneau is a summer resort. In winter, it becomes the deserted, rainswept scene for a murder attempt that attracts the interest of a Paris Superintendent Maigret. While his assistant Leroy uses ""science"" and ""deductions"" to trace the murderer, Maigret's instincts unerringly guide him to the real killer past a labyrinth of fascinating characters -- a failed medical doctor turned paranoid real-estate shark -- a passive, working class waitress whose heart secretly burns a torch of passion -- a aristocratic politician who pressures Maigret to ""make some arrests"" -- and a snarling stray dog that knows the murderer's real identity. Simenon took only a few days to write this story, but you will devour it within one night. -- Auralgo"
5,Rayborn Makes a Good First Impression,"Until about ten minutes ago, I had never heard any of Tim Rayborn's music. None of it. I didn't really even know who Tim Rayborn was. But then I met him on an Internet community site, got some links to some of his music clips, and liked what I heard. A lot. It's a break from your typical instrumental stuff, since he's using instruments from the areas that his music represents. If you're looking for a new sound, try this album. You won't be disappointed."
3,A good book if you can stomach the cuteness,"Deke and Galen have done a good job with this book but, egged on I'm sure by the ""dummies"" editors, they've made it almost nauseatingly cutsie-pie. A few important things are left out of the index: how to add a border or a caption to your print, for instance. If your stomach can stand the syrupy cuteness though it's a good tutorial and a pretty good reference work."
2,Disappointing,"I thought it covered a lot at the expense of depth. I bought it hoping to learn about color calibration in Elements and thought it was breezed through too quickly. Likewise on a number of other subjects. I also have ""Idiot's Guide to Digital Photography"" which discusses Photodeluxe, but I thought I learned more about using Elements from that book than from this one."
5,"wonder, gripping tale","This book not only is informative abouut the K-9 corps in Nam, but is a story about a man and his experience in the army. White showed that one can make mistakes and still come back from everything. I strongly suggest that anyone who has any interests in war, K-9's, or a great tale should read this book. It is an easy and quick read. Well worth every penny!"
4,Sounds like early underground Krautrock,"Organization's Tone Float doesn't sound like Kraftwerk, but it does sound like late 60s/early 70s Krautrock. Ralf and Florian made a big stylistic leap between Tone Float and the Kraftwerk 1 and 2 albums with the more free form Tone Float leading into more groove oriented percussion and riffs in the first two Kraftwerk albums. Organization's basic sound is similar to the first Tangerine Dream album Electronic Meditations, Saucerful of Secrets, Kluster, Limbus 4's Mandala, Stockhausen, and late 60s era Steve Reich. If you're into trippy chaotic experimental music, you'll probably enjoy this. Tone Float didn't make Julian Cope's Krautrock Sampler Top 50, but it does get listed in The Crack in the Cosmic Egg's Top 100 Krautrock Albums. The sound quality is acceptable: it's a pretty good quality vinyl transfer with some low level surface noise and distortion. If you want to hear the music you'll be grateful someone went through the effort to put out this cd."
3,A differnt sound from Kraftwerk,"I agree with all the above reviews, I have all the Kraftwerk albums and this is differnt. If you look at the album cover closesy, it shows what appears to be a african tribal man. This basically describes the sound of the contents. Some songs give you that african tribal drum music feel, with that electronic melodies. My recordding is very clear and you cannot tell it was taken from Vinyl. If your a Kraftwerk fan, you'll wnat this in your collection."
2,Thank God they stopped smoking pot.......,"I just bought this CD because i findly found a place where i could get it for under 25 bucks. As a kraftwerk fan for almost 25 years now, i knew enough about this album that it wouldnt be like the classic albums. Ive seen old pictures of them with when they were long hairs but i had no idea they were pot smoking hippys which this cd pretty much reveals. As a true hater of hippy music (except for groups like ronnie cook, the sonics and all the crazy garage bands from the 60's) I still can make myself like this one because I know where this band went. Its like listening to the ""warsaw"" album of the group that became Joy Division except that cd is absolutley amazing. I was hoping for a cd of some raw and primitive kraftwerk synthesizers, like the Normal or some of the cool old Gary Numan cds out there. Does anyone know where i can find a kraftwerk cd like that? maybe i need to look for a bootleg......"
2,El Juicio,"Well, was not what my husband and I expected, more songs of Hector Lavoe; but it is okay to listen it."
4,Use with Transcenders and you will pass,"This book is very good - as long as you don't use the CD-based test engine, as it WILL screw up your VB environment, and it doesn't score right. Make sure you download the errata from Sybex's website too. I found the material presented very well for study. I studied one chapter a day, doing all the sample questions. Then, once I'd finished studying from the book, I used the Transcenders. This formula will get you through. However, the book is a little thin in some areas including COM and ODBC Compliance. I took the exam today. The pass mark was 724 and I scored 840. Now it's on to Win Arch II..."
4,"Great book, but an overkill in some areas","I read the book, took the Transcender tests and passed the Microsoft test at first attempt. Some areas in the book are covered in too much detail. The Review questions are not very good. The Transcender test are a definite must to accompany the book. PS. This combo is propably the cheapest way to pass the test."
4,Solid presentation of Windows Architecture I info!,"So the MCSD requirements have shifted..like I'm going to wait to get certified! I'm only about half through the book, but it has been presented clearly, with no marketing hype. Good questions, too. A couple of typos here and there, but a good investment! I'm going after the Windows Arch. II book as soon as I finish this one!"
3,Watchout: Test Engine install screws up VB5 environment,"The ExamReady Test Engine installation screws up your Visual Basic 5 environment by replacing msvbvm50.dll and comcat.dll with bogus versions. The fix on Sybex's web site is incomplete as it only supplies msvbvm50.dll. Save these DLLs before running the ExamReady installation, restore them after the installation, and then run regsvr32 on both DLLs."
2,"Test questions not difficult enough, software very poor",I passed WinArch I at the first attempt but only just! The text is easy to read but the practise tests are nothing like the Microsoft exam and have too many errors. Ensure you check the errata section on the Sybex web site. Also look for more realistic tests from companys like Transcender.The software for the test engine never worked correctly even with the patches supplied by Sybex. I had to resort to hand checking each answer after completing an exam.
3,"Pretty Good, but MSDN is free!!! & better!!!","This is a pretty good book. For the simplier aspects of the test such as VSS, development tools, MSF, and Internet it provides enough info. But, for COM, unless you are an experienced in C++ or have authored components with VB, go to MSDN and search their OLE and COM papers. They are free, comprehensive, and well-written. It also contains good info on Data Access topics. One last thing, Do not trust the answers to the questions at the end of the chapters!"
1,One to avoid.,"I am so terribly disappointed with this book. In fact, as a paying customer, I am quite upset. I strongly recommend against purchasing it. The book is misleading and full of factual errors. The included practice tests and software are buggy and contradict the text.I planned on taking three days over a weekend to cover the material as a last preparation for the exam. By Sunday early in the afternoon, I was so frustrated with the book, I ran out to buy Mr. Prendegast's volume.The original version of this this review took up the full 1000 word limit for reviews here at Amazon.com. I cited a number of examples from the book and I was pretty hard on Mr. Ezzell. I decided not to publicly trash him. I passed the exam, but I can't say this book helped me at all."
5,"Thought-provoking, Heart-felt, Informative","I could fully identify with Jeannie Vegh and I cried buckets with her for the injustice of her circumstances, and then I was elated in the end to see that she has turned her life around to help other victims of abuse. She writes in a way that truly touches the heart. Her book should be read by anyone thinking of pursuing a relationship where signs of abuse lurk in the shadows, or, worse yet, are clear. This true story is easy reading, an attention-getter, and a page-turner you can't easily put down. Jeanie's foundation in psychology adds that extra weight necessary to close out her story with invaluable information. Author of ""VOWS BETRAYED: A Story of Abuse, A Transformational Message"""
3,More a toaster then oven,"This item has an interesting design. Unlike most ovens it's not square, or rectangular. It has a ""rounded"" back which allows a 12"" pizza to fit nicely.On the downside it has no real timer. It has settings for toast, but the longest is only about five minutes. You can not put your item in, set the timer, e.g. 20 minutes, and walk away. It's up to you to remember, and sadly I've sometimes missed the mark when I smell something burning.I'm not totally dissatisfied, but the lack of a timer is significant for me."
4,Works good so far.,"The toaster does a good job of toasting, and the oven is large enough to cook small meals. The controls are a little complicated though. There are 3 dials when 2 should have done as well. The first time I used the oven mode, I didn't realize that after I had selected the mode and the temperature, there was another dial to set to ON."
1,"Doesn't work anymore, almost exactly 1 year and 1 month","I bought this toaster just over a year ago and it has now stopped working! I contacted Delonghi, they told me that the warranty is for 1 year and I should take it to a service center. I explained to them, that was unacceptable! I owned a Black and Decker Toaster for 15 years and never had a problem. I bought what is supposedly a great brand: Delonghi toaster. I own it for just over a year and it just STOPS working and they will do nothing for me. I would NOT recommend anyone buy this toaster."
2,Too Long To Toast & Dies Just After A Year,"I've owned two of these ovens and they both died just after a year. Didn't realize how long it takes to toast until I was visiting someone and experienced how quickly their toaster oven works. I liked the color and size and didn't mind the clicking noise while it toasted, but will now look for a different replacement."
5,Wonderful!!!,This toaster oven is one of the best purchases I have made. It is a little more expensive than other ovens but it is sturdier and larger. I use it exclusively for all my baking/toasting. The only change I would make are larger nob displays. I needed to have replacement nobs but had no problem receiving them from the company. My favorite plus remark about this oven is that while it is in use the whole kitchen does not get hot. I have canisters nearby. They have never been effected by heat coming from the oven. Baking is quite pleasurable.
3,More sizzle than steak!!,"The DeLonghi EO1200B Large Capacity Toaster Oven is a nice compact and reasonably priced unit. The performance however is less than stellar. Even set to the darkest settings, it the norm to have to cycle the toaster again to acheive a satisfactory degree of doneness. Therefore a rating of only three stars. Asthetics aside, performance is why one buys a toaster oven and this is marginally acceptable by my standards."
3,Not as hot as previous toaster oven,"I purchased this DeLonghi toaster oven to replace one that worked great for years. I specifically chose this DeLonghi model because it seemed exactly the same as my previous oven, only a newer model. I am somewhat disappointed because it does not seem to get as hot as needed to broil small portions of fish and chicken and takes longer to toast. I have read lots of reviews that say newer models of ovens and grills do not reach the temperatures of older models - I guess it's because the safety police are protecting us from ourselves! I wish they had never been created."
3,Just a basic toaster Oven,"Just wanted a basic toaster Oven.. and this did the trick.. has a timer that actually turns off the oven when done, either for toast or bake.Oven is plenty big enough.. but crumb collection at botton is not so good. otherwise OK"
2,Product does not match instruction book sent,It might work fine but the directions are not clear and the pictures in the instruction book did not match the item received. There is no upper place for the the toaster position as shown in the manual.I bet you don't post our review.
2,NEW DElonghi ovens Cheap!,"I have owned many Delonghi Toaster ovens oven years.Delonghi ovens are generally made well & durable for years. Delonghi ovens are typically more expensive than other manufacturer but worth the money. This model EO1200B is from Delonghi newest line of toaster oven. It looks & is made very cheap. I used my mother's rmodel EO1200B oven and was very disappointed. Interior oven walls are made of aluminum not durastone enamel like other delonghi ovens. Aluminum inside oven impossible to clean. The wire rack can only be used one way. Other delonghi oven racks have 2 positions. Inside oven there are 2 positions/slots to put rack but bottom rack slot is too low to coils & will burn food. Pizza will fit in oven only if pizza is made ""perfectly"" to align with shape of back wall. Do not recommend this oven. Buy an older Delonghi ovens which are made much better. I think Delonghi cut corners on their NEW LINE of toaster ovens to compete with other manufactures prices!!"
1,Timer malfunction,"This is a nice, roomy, handsome toaster oven, but as in everything, handsome is as handsome does. I have had this toaster oven for only a couple of years, and it wasn't until I burned the toast that I realized that the timer bell was ringing but the timer didn't stop, moved on toward the ""ON"" slot, and the elements heated up again. I decided it was possible to remove the toast when the bell rang, shut the door, and not notice that the elements were heating up again. A DEFINITE FIRE HAZARD. I knew I could unplug the toaster immediately after every use, but I was afraid I or house guests might forget to take that precautionary, essential step. This total failure came as a big disappointment, because this malfunction came on so soon. I wonder if a digital timer would be more reliable. Or maybe it's time to return to the time-honored pop-up!"
1,Bad DeLonghi Experience,We purchased a DeLonghi toaster oven and both the toaster and oven functions stopped working right after the one year warranty expired. We barely used this product. When contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us. My $20 toastmaster lasted more than 15 years! This is the last time I buy a toaster based on appearance!
4,Great toaster oven,"We bought this toaster oven because our toaster wouldn't make good toast. This toaster oven makes perfectly golden brown toast. It does take a little longer than our toaster did, but it's worth it. We put it on Medium first, then butter the toast, then back in under Medium again and when the bell rings, you've got perfect toast. For bagels put to Dark setting and when the bell rings, perfect bagels. We did a pizza the other day, perfect. Better than in our oven. If you're patient...you will love this toaster."
2,OK Oven Short Life,Had it about a year and a half and it just died. I can't say there are any really good features to praise. Toasting is kind of slow.
1,Delonghi Toaster Oven,"Although aesthetically pleasing and a great additional feature of being able to fit pizza. This ""toaster""oven takes way to long to toast and doesn't seem to have enough of a heating element. I paid a little more than I normally would to get quality but was VERY Dissapointed."
4,"Good Programs, Good Value","These are not my four-year-old daughter's favorite programs but she does choose them occasionally from her CD-ROM album. The graphics are not cutting edge crisp but are still good by 2003 standards. Parents should love the Dr. Seuss as it brought back a lot of nostalgia for me. My daughter's first book to read on her own was Green Eggs & Ham so it's fun for her to see Dr. Seuss on computer too. All three games are highly educational and a good value sold together. It seems the ""Little Bear"" title is much easier than the other two."
5,Very well built,"Very thick and heavy for a drain ordered with a Kohler cast iron sink, nice way of squeezing to sink with 3 turn screws"
5,Great product!,It was shipped very quick and it was just what I wanted to match a dark oil-rubbed bronze faucet. I would recommend it to anyone that likes a oil-rubbed country look.
4,Kohler purchase,I am pleased with the Kohler purchase of the sink strainer. However I was not pleased to find that each box had a part missing. During installation by our plumber we had to pay for the parts that were missing from the boxes. Since we were on a time schedule this was necessary. I hope Kohler will pay more attention to quality control on the items they sell.
4,Straight Walking,This book is better than most because it starts simply and gradually expands the concept of Walking Bass. Harmonically it is excellent but is let down buy lack of rhyhmic ideas (ie none).A Glossary of rhythmic patterns/ideas at the end would have been nice. And why do writers insist on TAB when1. Doublebass doesn't have frets and2. What happened to learning to read.Instead of TAB I would prefer suggested fingering for the musical phrases (bass lines). This would often help when transposing key too.
4,Shoot everything,"I've been looking for a game that requires little to no thought and lots of guns. And this is it! You can't drive anything, and the lack of online or multiplayer play gets me wishing for more, but overall, it's still a fun game. If you like fast-paced games where running in with guns blazing (Belt-fed M249 - 150 rounds in a belt - oh yes) works just as well as standing back and sniping, this is the game for you. If you're looking for a game that's cheap and will eat up the time until Halo 3 comes out, this is the game for you.On a side note, though, I beat the game on ""normal"" setting fairly quickly (10-15 hours), but playing all the same levels again on ""hard"" is taking a lot longer (10-15 hours and I'm only halfway through)."
3,Fun While It Lasts,"I'm going to make this fast... Black is really fun to play. It doesn't last very long, which makes it a prefect rental. So what really hurts the game is the lack of replay value. To make the game last a little longer play it on hard from the get go... come on don't be a pansey.If your expecting a great story your going to be sadly mistaken, the story while intesting has little or nothing to do with the game play. You'll be fighting side by side with some teamates that may or may not be mentioned in the cutscenes.So all in all if you buy this game you are going to hate yourself in a couple of days but if you rent it your going to have a great time."
4,Black,"This game is first person shooter , very violent.If you like this kinda thing , its a great game."
5,Great FPS,"I bought this game the other day and was alittle bit unsure if i wasted my money until i got home and played the first mission. This game rocks and the sound and graphics as well. This is a keeper of a game to add into your library of games. The only things i don't like are the save options, no multi- player, and you have to wait through some long cut-scenes. If u want a fresh new fps game, i'de recommend. Maybe by the time i get done beating the game, EA's Godfather will be out. Can't wait."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"This game is horrible! When you reload, the screen fuzzes, the controls are too 'soft'. Does not feel natural. NO POINT TO THE GAME!!"
1,black,didn't get to play game .it will not work on xbox 360 need hard drive to play game . sold it to a friend
5,A blast from the past,"I bought this game back on my xbox, but lost it. Amazon saved mylife. I love this game"
4,Cool first person shooter,"This game is really good for anyone that likes blowing up alot of things. I really liked the graphics, and the sound is amazing in surround sound. Also I noticed that on the back of the game it didn't support a custom soundtrack but in the options you can switch it to a soundtrack on your hard drive.Overall this game is great, the only downside is the story is hard to follow the first time, and the same enemies over. What I loved the most is playing on Hard and Black Ops mode. This game is good for anyone that likes difficult games and lots of shooting. Its an intense game."
4,A frenetic FPS game,"""Black"" is a great FPS game. It is more of a ""shoot everything that moves"" game than a strategy shooter. It does require some thought to the tactics you need to complete a level and some of the levels are very tough. If you don't do some planning you probably won't get very far. The graphics are good, the sound effects great. There are several different weapons available, shotguns, SMG's, pistols etc. The AI is average with the bad guys being pretty predictable but still tough. It is an excting game that should be very challenging at the higher difficulty levels. I have been playing on ""Normal"" and it is tough. The violence and language are pretty rough so this is definitely not for young kids."
3,Black brings nothing new to the genre,"Black is a pretty cool game. You're a special ops guy who uses a bunch of different machine guns, sniper rifle, RPG, grenades and an assortment of handguns. The problem is....every other game has that stuff, too. Add in the fact that there is no online play and you have a game that's been done a million times before. Black does have one thing that most FPS don't...NO JUMP BUTTON. Fancy that! You can't jump over stuff so often times you get stuck on the edge of a box or railing and the enemy just blows you away. Also, you can't get to the places where your enemies are sometimes. That's bunk!Anyway, Black is simply ok. Its fun for a while, but the entire time you are playing you just keep thinking, ""haven't I played this game before?"""
2,Needlessly dull and dimwitted...,"Black is one of those games that you either like or dislike - no middle of the road. In my opinion, this game has no redeeming qualities. The explosions are fun, but don't even kill the enemies 90% of the time. The guns are impressively rendered, but don't even kill the enemies 60% of the time - you have to unload an unreal amount of bullets into an enemy just to make them hop around on their foot. And the enemy spawn points are so ill-designed - you destroy a room completely with bullets and explosions and then an enemy comes from behind a box that survived the mayhem. All and all, I really wish that I had wasted my money on some game that had a good story, had interesting levels, and gave me good replay value for my gaming dollar. If you want to try this game, let me know and I'll send you my copy! Be forewarned - you'll be bored before you're even halfway finished..."
2,Disappointing end....,"Although I did enjoy reading Halfway Home, I was especially curious on how the 2 women (mother and daughter) would meet after so many years.That motivated me to keep on reading, the more I read the more curious I was on how the confrontation would be, I was ready for very emotional feelings, ready to cry, wanting so bad for them to meet again and be a part of how that would be. I was also hoping that the grandmother would play a bigger role and would somehow be forced to tell 'the truth' about the missing letters etc.For those who have read this book, you can imagine my disapointment the way the book ends. For me, totally an abrupt & boring end...."
2,Disappointing end....,"The end was very much disappointing. I couldn't believe that such a nice book to read had such an abrupt end, it's a real shame!!"
3,Better Than Most Fabriclive Albums,"Personally I think Fabriclive is a terrible series that consistently produces below average (albeit live) mixes. Fabriclive.34 falls somewhere about average. When are MC's going to realize that it is not cool to call out your name over and over during a set?Couple of good tracks on the album include: ""Is She Really Going Out With Him?/One In the Front"" by Joe Jackson, ""Twisted"" by Rob Le Pitch, and the 2nd and 3rd bonus tracks by Kuts. Otherwise the album is pretty forgetable and frequently interrupted by the MC.3/5 stars."
5,Gorgeous,"Much like Damien, I found this book to be absolutely gorgeous. The characters are rich, and intriguing. Eve Byron has a simply wonderful style, capturing the characters with vividness, humour, sadness and love."
3,"Same LEGO's, New Hair","Uplink is one of several micro battle machines from the new Exo-Force line. While this set has that Japanese anime look and decent gimmicks like the laser cannon and missiles, its weakest ""link"" is in its durability. If you want to beat this thing in a fight, aim for the arms; they sag down so much, that this reviewer had to buy another LEGO set to fix them. The legs, with joints that look like the gears of a pocketwatch, are rigid and may frustrate your little tyke. But they last and allow for a vast array of poses. While stickers are included for Uplink, its most animeish feature is the mini-figure. While it's pretty standard, different faces are painted on both sides of the head, which is topped with a set of day-glow hair. So Uplink is a nifty toy that should keep your kid busy for a while. But remember-there's more fun in numbers."
5,pefer call of duty,"this game was okay i did'nt really care for it the begining was great but after that the game started to get boring and plus your team was'nt really on your side only at the begining they were, this game sucked call of duty is better."
2,Disappointment,"In terms of sound and graphics, Black is superior to any almost any other console FPS. Despite its technical brilliance, Black is an utter disappointment in my opinion. The game is remarkably short, there's no story at all, there's no point, the enemy AI is horrific, and you have to shoot each baddie about twelve times to kill them.What about headshots? Well, sometimes its a one shot kill and other times it takes about five bullets.Don't bother trying to employ any sort of stealth or strategy as you move through each mission. Yeah you'll have a silenced weapon, but after having to shoot the same guy twelve times to kill him things usually turn into a massive firefight.The game can probably best be described as an A-Team style over-the-top ridiculous Vin Diesel action movie. If you want insane action and the ability to destroy everything that moves, pick up the vastly superior Mercenaries instead."
5,Intensity galore.,"There is no blood in a M rated game. At first that turned me away from this game. It was ""x"" amount of dollars so I gave it a shot.It was worth it. You play as a blak-ops man in an interrogation cell.As you are questioned you play each mission as a flashback.Lest's start of with the cons:-Too short(8 levels. apprx 6-8 hours)-Not enough weapons(8 apprx)-No blood(minor and livable)Pros:-Intense-Cussing(graciously placed f-bombs+ alot of other words)-Graphics(Beautiful)-Gameplay(Standard)-Level design(not linaer but not confusing)This game is worth every penny you spend on it."
5,very fun game but hard too!,nice game!really fun!it is actually really hard to play even in the easy mode!I am still playing it and it s been a month since I bought it.I totally recommend this game!
5,WIll Blow You Out of Your Chair,"The producers of this game have described the game as ""gun porn."" That is a dead-on accurate description. In a porno film, the plot provides an excuse for gratuitous sex.In BLACK, the plot is merely an excuse for massive devastation and violence. While there is plenty of violence, there is no real blood. If this game had contained the kind of blood splattering you see in games like HITMAN, it would have been banned in most countries. I'm serious. Even without the blood, it's hard to stomach at times. To be sure, this game is a total assault on the senses.The graphics are incredible, placing you in environments where you are hopelessly outnumbered. Your hope for survival lies in your speed and accuracy with your weapons, as well as the combustible elements of your landscape."
2,Just Rent It,"I'm glad I rented this game instead of buying it. It's fun as far as blasting everything and everyone in sight for stress relief. The graphics are very well designed. However, I found the autosave feature to be crap. No matter how far you go in a level or how many check points you hit if you don't finish that level you MUST start the whole level over again later. I also wish they had allowed the ability to skip the live action interigation series that preceedes each level. Each time you play you are forced to sit through several minutes of talk that you've heard before and don't need to hear again. The game's fun for what it is (a shooter with no depth or real story line) but I would recommend heading to Blockbuster and renting it as it's not worth the purchase price."
4,Pretty good PRETTY SHORT,"Well Well...Another FPS. But this is not like anyother FPS. Destroy anything that comes your way, EXTREME ACTION too,BUT the game is way TOOOOOO short(I beat it in 6 hours Literally), but its fun to replay it over and over again. The artificial intelligence (sorry im kinda tired) stinks. They are soooo stupid. When you shoot the they dont even know. Bunch of stupid heads...haha...yea sorry bout that. I hope this review helped you. If your loookin for a great quality game try some bond games or sniper elite, try hitman, or call of duty 2"
2,Black,"This game seems like it would have been fun several years back. I bought it because my PS3 got the YLOD, and I wanted something to play until I fix it. If you are reading this review because you are actually considering buying it, I advise you to find a better game to play. With input lag that is even more noticeable than in Killzone 2 and a non-adjustable look sensitivity, this game is almost impossible for me to play, especially coming from Call of Duty Black Ops... which happens to be stuck in my broken PS3. Anyway, if it is your first fps game, it could be fun. Otherwise, save your money."
2,"Great graphics, that's it...","Pros:Great graphics!Cons:It's short (but I got bored and didn't bother to finish it).Gameplay is too conventional and not really that innovative.Not realistic:- One man army- Dumb enemy AI- Lots of bullets- Believe it or not, I can do stealthy sniping with my silenced pistol!!!If you like FPS, it's worth a try.But if realism matters so much, don't bother..."
3,too repetive! each level roughly the same,"I thought this game was going to be ""all that"" but, it is too short and all u do is shoot people with no strategy at all! Enemies are very stupid, i mean very stupid, and.... each level u do the same thing; get a gun, shoot the crap out of everything, shoot more people(no strategy involved if i already mentioned) and just blow up crap for no reason. This game is amusing, but i would not buy it, i would rent it. u will never play this game again. Really mediocre game."
3,Where is the rest of it?,"Black is a very fun first person shooter. the exposions are great and the guns are alaso awesome. HOWEVER....... it takes forever to kill someone. I hit a guy in the chest 4 times with an M5 and he is still shooting at me? why? Why???? In real life that is overkill. 5 shots to a person's chest means that you shot him 3 times while he was laying on the ground in agony. Another problem i had with this game is the lack of blood. This game is rated mature isn't it? If so, then I want the full package. I want big guns, big explosions, and blood. Is that too much to ask for? I guess i should also ask why is the game so short? Within a few hours i was done.If you like watching things blow up and big guns then maybe this might entertain you for a good 3 hours."
5,I like explosions!,"This game obviously had a lot of work put into it and it shows. The graphics are good for a PS2 game, and the sound is is excellent. The game play is very long and a single mission could easily take you over half an hour, but it pulls you in and is a great FPS game. The game has many levels which get progressively more challenging and it goes from easy to impossible. I think it will take me quite some time to fully complete it."
4,BLACK,"game was great,could not get it to save,returned to Electronic Arts as instructed and have not received a replacement yet, not a happy camper."
3,Hm....,"This game has put me somewhat in a dilemma for a review. On one hand, I think the game was pretty good. I had a lot of fun playing it the first time around. Also, I think the graphics are probably the best I've ever seen on the PS2. However, the re-play factor for the game is absolutely horrible, and now that I've beaten the game, I rarely play it. Also, I think this game would have been a much greater hit if it had online capabilities. However, you're stuck to single player action, which tends to get old after awhile. Good start, not so great finish."
5,most realistic FPS ive ever played,"no game in the world matches up to this game. i have only played through 2 missions and i love it more than any other. the guns are beatiful. the graphics and sounds are indescribably realistic. that is all i can say you HAVE to play it for yourself to really get what im telling you. rent it, wait until the price goes down to 20 dollars to get a good deal and buy this AMAZING game."
2,the game needs some blood and gore effects.......,"This game was worse than i expected since it was a Greatest Hits title. it's not too bad though it could have included an in game map or radar. and also there's no blood and gore in the game. if the game was going to be a rated M game anyway , why not include blood . it's worse than those crappy rated T shooter games . at least those are more interesting. and the story line is retarded. i have no idea how this became a Greatest Hits title. either it was an error or the gaming industry is going to the dogs."
3,Nothing Special,"Basically this is a nothing special gameCons -Save/Check points are few and far in betweenHave to shoot Enemies for a long time before they actually dieVery Very weak story, yet they force you to watch long boring cut scenes of dialog (no action)Limited Weapon SelectionEasy Mode can be Quite DifficultDisappointing EndingYou can Hear Nearby Enemy footsteps but they are actually very far awaySmall Selection of WeaponryPros -Great Graphics for PS2Great Sound (Dolby Digital)Misc -TeamMates don't usually DieNo Blood / Gore, but Fowl Language (F*** is common Place)Greatest Hits ($19.99 / >$15 used)"
5,Black as my heart.,"Excellent 1st Person shooter, and I really am blown away by the cinematic firefights. I would recommend this game to anyone looking to play in realistic combat sequences."
5,Outstanding.. nothing less !!,"For a Ps2 title this is quite amazing. The sound effects are incredible, destructible environments, superb graphics, were do I stop? This title makes Call of Duty 1-3 offerings on the Ps2 platform, look embarrassingly bad. This game is VERY impressive LOVE, love, love this one ! If you like war games get and play you`ll enjoy it every step of the way"
3,fun game... nothing amazing,"from the packaging and the menu design, this game seems like it's made for folks with a major gun fetish. once you start playing, though, it's a pretty typical FPS. cool levels, cool graphics, etc. i occasionally get lost in the middle of a mission, though, because they don't always make it obvious where you're supposed to go. there's no compass or map with landmarks - they sometimes tell you verbally what direction to go, but if there's music or an explosion at the same time, you are left with no idea where to go. i wandered around a level for about 15 minutes last night trying to find the next group of enemies. pretty good game - worth playing. nothing special though."
2,Ahhhhhhhhhh! Lions!!!,I love magic tree house books but not this one!! This one was creepy. They could havd gotton chewed up by those lions guarding there magic tree house!
5,the best series of books I have ever read,"this is a second level book and I really liked the plot. It was easy to read, easy to comprehend, and the linguistic pattern appealed to my unique sense of humor. I highly recommend this classic of american literature to any other 7 year old out there"
5,Lions at Lunchtime,"My 7 year old inhaled this book-- over 60 pages-- without stopping! The entire series has been excellent. Great character development, always a social lesson along with lessons about history and science, well-paced, and fun. High motivator for reading, and got him to make that leap to reading silently. Strongly recommended for early readers."
3,Great book,I like this book a whole lot it it is great. I read { your books} whenever I get a chance
4,from my 10-year-old,I read the Magic Tree House series all the time and I think the whole series so far is wonderful!
5,Read This Book Now!,Lions at LunchtimeBy: Mary Pope OsborneGMy book is about Jack and Annie going to Africa. Jack can't find the lions. Will Jack find the lions? The story tells about Jack and Annie's exciting adventures to solve riddles and become librarians.I like the book because I like adventures. My favorite part is when Annie gets stuck in the mud because she was going across the river while getting chased by wildebeasts.Mary Pope Osborne's story can be fun and interesting when shared with your brother or sister.
3,Not helpful for miscarriage,"I recently had a miscarriage at 7 weeks. I bought this book because the title addressed miscarriage. The author experienced the death of her baby one day before it was born. No matter how she tried to include the aspects related to miscarriage, that is not what her experience was based on. I feel like there is a world of difference between a miscarriage and the death of a baby that you have a funeral for. I found myself feeling so sad for people who lose babies later in pregnancy and shortly after birth and not seeing the connection between miscarriage. I realize that this book may be more helpful to me after I get pregnant again, but for now it has gone on the bookshelf."
5,Best on Pregnancy after Stillbirth,"Out of all the books I have read after the death of my son at 33 weeks in utero, this book was the only one to specifically address subsequent pregnancy. While the author does touch on other types of infant death, I think the fact she had experienced stillbirth gives her the perspective I need to get though my current pregnancy. Many, many books focus on losses due to miscarriage, and they should since it is very common. However, books dealing with stillbirth are rare and I have found this book to be extremely helpful. The fact that it has chapters that focus on the different trimesters is great. I got this book in my first trimester and after I read that chapter, I had a better idea that the conflicting emotions that I was experiencing were *normal*.I look forward to using this book during the remainder of my pregnancy. I would recommend it to anyone who has experienced a stillbirth."
5,Awesome,This book was an incredible walk through the grief of losing a child and the hope of having another one. It didn't judge or recommend one path it just gave the reader ways to make her own decisions and examine her own feelings.
1,A book without an idea.,"Some authors write books without having a single idea to add to the topic, such as this. To pray was the best this author could come up with. Not much insight into the journey of loss and recovery. Not even very artful description of the process of loss, excepting a few anecdotes. I am convinced the book was written to address the market need, not inspired by revelation at all.If my sister were looking at buying this book, I was suggest she move on to another one and not waste a moment more. With that, neither shall I."
2,not helpful for early miscarriage,"I miscarried at 10wks and did not feel this book was helpful.My feelings of loss were not validated by the author as the majority of her example were of 3rh trimester miscarriages, stillbirth, or infant deaths. I would recommend reading ""Trying Again"" to couples experiencing an early pregnancy loss."
5,excellent book for pregnancy after preemie loss,"my wife & i had a preemie at almost 27 weeks and lost her 13 days later. we are now pregnant with twins and this book really helped my wife AND me understand our feelings and that they were normal. I recommend this book to anyone , men and women, who lost a child, after birth or by miscarriage, and is now pregnant."
5,a wonderful book,"This book has helped to keep me sane after I lost my son, my only child, at 28 weeks (he was stillborn). It covers so many of the issues that women who are contemplating pregnancy after a loss are unfortunately faced with--from listing specific causes of pregnancy loss, to gently & reasuringly guiding a pregnant woman (who has previously lost a child) through each anxiety-ridden trimester. I especially like the in-depth chapter on high risk pregnancies, as I am considered high risk & have trouble finding good information for coping with high risk pregnancy. A very well-written, heart-felt book that is both emotionally comforting and informative. A must-have!"
1,not received yet ...,I am sorry not to be able to send a review since after a month the package is still not here ... It is way too long and i wish i had it on time for xmas since it was supposed to be a gift ...
5,Mind-testing puzzles and colorful presentations,"Zoboomafoo is an educational Windows/Macintosh CD-ROM computer software for children ages 3 through 6, featuring Zoboo and his animal friends from the Emmy award-winning children's television series Animal Junction. Mind-testing puzzles and colorful presentations teach young people about a wide variety of creatures and their habitats. Zoboomafoo also educates young users about number recognition, counting, early phonics, logical reasoning, and more. A creature fact book is included in this enjoyable, instructive, and highly recommended software for both homeschool, preschool, kindergarten, and daycare center collections and curriculum supplementation."
4,A Big Treasure Hunt in Animal Junction,"This is one really cool game.You have to find 8 puzzle peaces to win.There are games such as counting coyotes and spot the difference.Not everything you click on has a game to play.Some have the treasure,some say things,and others show you animals.There are 4 different prizes."
1,How Frustrating and Disappointing,Wish I could give this 0 stars. I cannot get this to run on our WIn 95 machine (yes I know it's a dinosoar but that's what we have for my child) and it continually crashes on our XP machine. Broderbund (the software company) has not responded to my pleas for help except to give me 4 different case #'s. AAAGGGGHHHH. My 3 year old and I are frustrated to the extreme.
5,"Barretto's Best ""Tipico"" Album","This was Ray Barretto's first album after part of his band had left him to form Tipica '73, and it is arguably his best one. A few of the songs are new interpretations of old standards (ie. ""La familia"" was originally done by the Sonora Matancera, and ""Ay No"" by Tito Rodriguez), while others are originals (like Roberto Rodriguez's ""La orquesta""). Regardless, they are all excellently played. The arrangements are imaginative, and the players are outstanding. But what in my opinion, makes this album special are Eddy Martinez's piano, Art Webb's flute, and especially, Tito Allen's vocals. I heartily recommend it to anyone who appreciates fine Cuban music."
1,abad remaster,the front and back cover is not the original. look like a bad item.the produccion of thse cd was an error.
5,R.I.P. Sr. Barretto,"I just got the news that Ray Barretto died today. It really hit me harder than I thought. I've since gone and dug up all my old Fania vinyl and have been playing tribute to him as he would have wished - at least I'd like to think so anyway - by playing these wonderful songs. To pick one Barretto lp is a crime, but this lp here is among his finest of his finest. You can really do no wrong with anything he graced, but if you're new to him...start here. And relish, cherish and delight in what will touch you.You will be greatly missed Sr. Barretto."
2,It looks nice...BUT!,"I bought this clip to replace a broken one on my art board. It is quite nice looking, and seems to have an extremely strong spring. However, when carefully riveting to the masonite art board, the base bent. Flimsy metal base that you can bend with your hand."
3,Nice mix but record company should be punished for false adv,"This is a nice intro to salsa music. The album has some slow and some fast songs, as well as both male and female singers. The only problem with the cd itself is that it lists 16 songs but only comes with 13. So if you buy it expecting 16 songs be aware of that. Other than that you probably can't go wrong."
4,Amazing must have,"This Cd is an amazing piece of work by the other two members of New Order. Their debut album was a little lacking, but with their sophomore release they found it. This is an amazing compilation of songs that I can't stop playing. Being that I finally got hold of this cd 6 years after its release, it might as well have been released today. A must have for anyone that loves new order or any of the side projects. It's also a must have for people that are looking for REAL music from artists that know how to produce it."
1,Superhighway to hell ...,After having heard the first release from these to members of New Order I could not wait to listen to their second release. I searched high and low for it finally paying a hefty price ... only to be mortified by what I was hearing. Please do not wast your time or money.
5,A great story with a dynamite ending.,"This is one of Jorge Amado's most intriguing stories. It differs from his earlier sociological and ideological works. It is a story of a man who lives a life based upon his own created self image. It explores the idea of what is reality or truth and at the same time presents a wonderful picture of the culture of Northeastern Brazil around the early part of this century. The adventures of the protagonist are hilarious and the ending is surprising and very satisfactory. I have read many of Jorge Amado's books and I find that ""Home is the Sailor"" is the most readable of all his novels."
2,Buyer Beware,"We bought this camera last October....It is small and compact which is a major plus. I have noticed that 80% of the pictures I have taken, have the red eye. We just recently went on a cruise, and the camera does not take very good quality pictures inside a comedy club with decent lighting... the people moving around were blurry. Lastly, when I went to power on the camera yesterday, it makes an awful noise, and then the screen blinks the canon logo, then goes black with an E18 error. I contacted Canon, and its not covered by warranty, and the repair will cost more than the camera did new. They claim that it was due improper use or mishandling. The camera went dead while it was on, and the shutter is left extended... Recharged the battery, and now the shutter will not go back in... and thats MISUSE? I will never buy another Canon ever...which is why Im at Amazon.com right now to purchase a new camera."
2,not a good choice!,"The things that are wrong/bad about this camera are the following:1. no optical zoom- when you use the digi zoom, the pictures come out not clear or win big pixels / NOT flawless2. it ALWAYS makes the eyes red3. battery doesn't last for a long time. i had to buy 3 more batteries for this camera.4. the flash range is just short.I love the sd450 more. takes great photos in great colors!"
3,"Great picture potential, tiny camera, but...","No optical zoom! Even at 5 mega-pixels, I end up missing shots I used to get on my 2.1 MP elph. I also have quite a bit of difficulty with blurry pictures. Consider the larger elph with the zoom."
4,good paint with FDA aprv,"We painted two times, full colored belly, and still lots of paint left.pros: it said FDA approved, but who knows :)easy to remove, easy to cleanpretty efficient, vivid colorcons: package looks cheapsince it's easy to remove, it also means sensitive to water, if you want multiple layers, be careful, the color can be mixedno grey color, no earth color, hard to mix to get an idea color if you don't want to use these basic colors"
2,not what i thought; its just paint,"I thought it would give you ideas of how to paint or what to paint but it is just the paint itself and a sponge, which is a little overpriced for what it is. Great concept and it turned out really well, just wonder if i could have bought some non toxic paint at the local store for 10% of the cost."
1,Paint chips,"The paint looks great, until it dries. It chips and looks horrible. It takes forever to apply as well because the paint doesn't want to stay on the skin. I tried painting a pumpkin for halloween. After 4 hours of painting, it looked great, until it dried and began flaking..."
3,one colour missing,"Orange colour was missing, a pity during Halloween time when you want to draw pumpkins up.The box was a bit worn out, other colours were OK."
2,Disappointed,I was so excited to receive my kit but that quickly ended when I opened it and it was missing a color. Amazon wouldn't send me the color I was missing and offered to credit my order 10% or I can send it back for a new kit. With that said its not convient for me to return items and the shipping to my APO address takes at least 2 weeks one way. I ordered this kit for a specific occasion that will pass before I get a new kit. The product itself was very small for the amount of money we pay
2,Belly Painting kit,"I just received the Belly Painting kit but I have not used it yet. I have to say that when I opened up the box, I was very disappointed though. It looks like a little paint box that toddlers would paint with and I would not pay what I did for it so no I would not recommend the painting kit."
3,"Pieces missing, damaged","I was so excited to order this product when I saw it! It had plenty of colors and my husband and kids were just over-flowing with awesome ideas for some great pictures for the baby book. I received the product on time and the packaging was in great condition. However, the black paint was missing, and the orange and pink paints were broken into pieces! So that was pretty disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this product for two reasons. First, for $20.00 I expected a way better product than this, and second, after reading other reviews I see that I am not the only person that got ripped off by having one of the colors missing or damaged. Nevertheless, I'm sure that we will still be able to pull off some pretty sweet paintings on my 9-month belly!"
5,What a bargain!!!,"All I was looking for was a simple CAD program to lay out floor plans, etc. but at the price for this product I thought ""What the heck"" and ordered it. What a bargain! It arrived promptly and has been fun using some of the more advanced features I didn't know I needed."
2,Turbo Cad V14,"I have been using a limited version of Quick Cad for several years now and really would have been happy to acquire a key to unlock the expanded version of same, but was not able to find such, anywhere....so i purchased the Tcad v14 hoping i would be able to move up the ladder in difficulty and also accomplish more sophisticated shop drawings, even limited site drawings....however, the learning curve and the key strokes are so different from Qcad I haven't been able to walk away from my previous tools.....it's a shame i couldn't have tested this product prior to purchase, i probably would not have bought it....nevertheless, i will over time overcome the hurdles to converting, because it does appear to be a better package, it just does not appear to me to conform to typical keystrokes and user patterns in creating drawings.....[...] 4-26-09"
4,Pretty good CAD program,"I have used a cheaper and easier to use CAD program for years. I needed to load it on a new laptop and found that it been scratched. I needed to purchase a new CAD program and found Trubo CAD 14. Don't be fooled ... this is a hard program to learn. But it does so much more than what I was used to using. It comes with a pretty good tutorial CD (several hours). After watching about a third of the tutorial CD I was able to draw, in detail, plans for a new backyard BBQ bar area for my contractor and it came out pretty good if I do say so myself. If you need a CAD program and have the time and mind to learn this program ... you'll love it!!!"
5,from the futer!!!,"these dolls are all about the futer style, this doll is the only one im missing!!!(in the collection!)she is so pretty, but not the best clothes in the collection, dana's clothes are!sasha is the lead of the band!my friend has this doll, and i have all of these dolls exepet this one!!!! waaaa!"
4,Elvis When He Tried,"This Elvis album was recorded in March 1975. This was the last time RCA Records managed to drag Elvis into a recording studio. Any albums released after this were either live albums, or they were recorded in a makeshift studio in Elvis' own house. Elvis had lost his love for recording at this point. He recorded the bare minimum number of songs required for this album, and did far less takes than he usually did. He used to be a perfectionist who would perform a song over and over until it was pefect, but by this point he would just perform a song a few times until it was ""close enough"". Despite that, the album is still pretty good. There isn't a bad song here, especially compared to some of the junk Elvis recorded for his film soundtracks. ""T-R-O-U-B-L-E"" is my personal favorite here, but all the songs have something to offer. I recommend this album to Elvis fans."
4,rockin the house,"when this album was released, elvis was 40 yrs old, and going thru a lot of issues in his life, his voice quality is up to par, and t-r-0-u-b-l-e, was a great rock tune.....how ever,as much as the release was good,...the quadraphonic release of the 8 track, and album, was much better, all of the unnessary back up vocals, and sweetening of the music by felton jarvis was eliminated....hopefully r.c.a-b.m.g...will release some of the quad out takes..!"
5,"Great mat, no packaging issues",There was no tape as the other reviewer mentioned. I almost didn't buy it because of that too! Item arrived as described in perfect condition. Just what I wanted.
3,Good Mat. Destructive Shipping,"Received the exercise mat with two pieces of tape keeping it rolled for shipping.Adhesive from tape pulled off top layer from the neoprene rubber mat.Two inch wide adhesive packaging tape was a very poor choice.It is impossible to remove without pulling off a layer of the neoprene mat.Neoprene rubber should be secured with plastic wrap, which has no adhesive.Mat still performs it's function, albeit with a few scars from the ill-advised shipping technique."
3,Misleading,"This item is advertised to have a carrying handle -- I did not receive one, so I called the Customer Service Department. The explanation is that the cut-out in the mat is actually the handle. There is no separate handle! If there were 2 cut-outs, one at the top and one at the bottom, that would make more sense.If you keep this in one place -- no problem, but I take it to classes with me, an it is ridiculous to try to carry this around with no handle!"
1,exercise mats,The exercise mats were advertised as 1 inch thick and it is only 1/2 inch thick. I sent a email to customer service and did not receive a response back. Then I contacted amazon and sent a email with no response.Then I contacted the company who sold me this item for the second time and no response. I am still waiting for a response but i am not holding my breath. I have not used the exercised mats. I will never deal with this company again. Failure of this company to value their customers is unacceptable. They are the worst.
3,Best of Chuck Mangione,This is not what I expected. These are his hits from the later label and although the music is good its NOT his BEST. I would suggest the other Best of - from his earlier works.
3,Another one that loses point for a lousy reprint.,"A lot has been written about the original Wright flyers, but relatively little about the engines that powered. Like the planes, themselves, the engines were designed by the Wright brothers because they couldn't find engines light enough and powerful enough for their designs. The resulting engines were marvels of mechanical ingenuity combined with some really dumb design decisions. Still they worked, and like the airplanes themselves, advanced the state of t he art.I wish I could rate this book more highly, but missing illustrations and lousy (no?) proofreading pull it way down."
2,um did we all read the same book?,i can't believe any of the other reviewers of this book really read this book. the book i read is awful. i kept wondering if the book was written in english. skip it!!
1,"Wretched, derivative, vanity published crap","What else is there to say? Start with an abused, mysterious, orphaned boy and pile on endless formuaic garbage and you've got this book. Do yourself a favor and leave it for the author and his parents and friends and his assorted shills to buy. They have to pretend to like it. You, on the other hand, do not."
2,"As always, ignore 5 star reviews","The author is very creative, and a couple of the ideas are somewhat fresh (as has already been stated, some ideas are a blatant ripoff of other writers). The main problem is that the writing and editing are abysmal. High school creative writing classes have better writing . . . A good book review would provide examples, but I just can't bear going through it again. My primary message is, no matter what the book, ignore the sycophants who give 5 stars; these are almost always written by people who have only read one book ever."
2,"Been There, Done That.","It's a fairly derivative re-hashing of a combination of Zecharia Sitchin's work and Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash.It could be ok for the right audience, like very young adults, but it's no Harry Potter or Lemony Snicket."
3,Could use a good editor,"Like many of the reviews for this book, I found it very imaginative and fairly enjoyable, but a good editor would really have helped smooth out its rough spots. I guess that's one of the risks of self-publishing.Only after I purchased the book did I realize it was intended to be a series. (I usually avoid series until they are completed.) But fortunately, my worst fear (that it would end inconclusively or in a cliff hanger) was not realized. There is ample opening for further stories, but you won't be left hanging. (Though I found the ending a bit rushed.)The fact that the story wraps itself up is especially important because it appears that the author has abandoned his efforts: for an internet entrepreneur, his book-related websites are all largely defunct.- [...]- His myspace page mentions a second book ""coming summer 2006"" and the comment section is filled with months of spam."
2,Pretty cheap and useless,"My main gripe with this and others like it are the lack of sleeves in them and they are oversized. I don't need or want an extra quarter inch of fake leather and plastic on each side of the cards. I want it more compact on the sides, thicker overall and to able to hold my collection of 20 or more rarely used cards. I still own the only decently made one I found in a Thrift store, expanded with a longer barrel screw from a stationary store and extra sleeves from a second one."
2,Not what I was looking for,"While the craftsmanship of this item was fine, it just did not suit my needs. Once I filled up the slots with my credit cards it became to bulky for me. However, it would be fine for wallet size pictures."
1,dangerous fire hazard,"this torch is either a flame thrower or a puny, useless flame that goes out after burning for about 3 seconds! it takes a lighter held up next to the torch to light it. i'm going to try and return it. absolute waste of time and money!!!"
2,WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR AN eBOOK,WHY TO PAY THAT BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR JUST AN EBOOK??? NO SENSE AT ALL! DON'T BUY IT!
4,It is useful,The replacement is very important for the functioning of Zippo. I am very pleased how dispenzador for easy transport and the time of the rafter of flint.
5,6 pieces of flint one card,"this was a very straight forward purchase. I got one (1) card containing six (6) flints. whoever thought they where getting more really doesnt deserve to be allowed on the interent. as for the product its a genuine Zippo item for cheap, and shipping couldn't have been faster. got it in a day and a half. very good seller id buy again."
3,Very Misleading,"Item description states pack of six flints, 24 cards. That is what is pictured. DO NOT BELIEVE IT! You get, or at least I got, one pack(card) with 6 flints."
1,I got Shammed,"I ordered this item because it said 6 zippo flints (pack of 24) and what did I get? One, one lousy pack. How is this labeled as a special ""add on item""? My local grocery store sells these for $0.69 a pack and I bought a pack for $2 and some odd cents. I like how they recently changed the listing to no longer say pack of 24. I'm pretty pissed and Amazon basically told me there is nothing they can do. I know it's on $2 but its the principal the original price was $16 so it was obviously talking about an entire case."
3,over priced,The flints are good but you can find them localy for much cheaper I also found them on budk.com for .99 cents
1,D,"I saw a 24 pack with 6 flints for one price, not for one box of 6 flints. What I spint for the one package I could have gone to the store and got one for less than what I paid."
2,Not 24 as described.....,"I received 3 cards which contains 6 flints per card. In my math, that equals 18 and not 24. I also noticed on the invoice under Comments-""This sale is for 3 dispensers containing 6 flints each for a total of 18 individual flints"". Why can't they put that in their description so people don't feel like they got ripped off when they receive their order. And for Christ sake change the picture so it shows only 3 cards!!!"
2,Only got 1 card,I only got one card... expected 24.... I feel that the title is very misleading as to what one actually receives
4,Good Value,"Works well in my IMCO lighter, and free shipping is always a plus. My only complaint is that I went to Kroger a few days later, and found the same product for about a dollar less."
1,Dishonesty!!!!!,I got this product thinking that i was getting the entire seventy some odd flints. No i got one flint card with six flints. Total rip off. don't get this. Go to a grocery store or a fuel station and get them there.
3,One Pack of Flints,The description should list that they only ship one pack of flints per order. It is deceitful to show a box of flints when only one flint card is shipped. It was still a good price for the one pack though
4,good flints,This is the third time I buy this product. These are good flints at a reasonable price. I wish I could say more...
5,It works.,"This is one of those items that's either 1 star or 5 stars. There's just not really any middle room.And seeing as how my zippo works again, I assume it deserves 5 stars."
5,Wicks not Flints,"I ordered the box of flints, but received instead a box of wicks. I'm a little reluctant to order again, but will. Because no one else seems to have had this problem, I'll assume it's a fluke. Now I've got enough wicks to last a lifetime.I won't sent them back because it's too much trouble for the price. So will try again. I gave it five stars because I'm sure the wicks are good ones, even though they're not what I ordered."
4,Thinkin' Things Toony the Loons,All of the Thinkin' Things programs make childdren think. Just what I needed.
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!,"I found this CD in a small record store. I must say that this CD is garbage, and I'm so angry I waisted money on it. I love all kinds of dance music, but I can't find room in my heart for this album. I'm serious when I say that there is not one good track on this album! It's way too dreary and empty to enjoy. I've always been disappointed in Fabric albums, but this one has reached a new level in low. Steer clear of this at all costs!!!!"
4,No complaints,"I ended up dropping the class I needed this for, so now I have a bunch of Hitler books I don't need, but no complaints against the service from Amazon."
1,Not worth it!,"This book is very poorly organized and written. The first five chapters are so-so and the problems given the information in the text is good; though the constant strings of mathematical expressions (without text) makes it hard to follow. However, once you get to the seventh chapter and beyond the chapters give very little explanation of anything and the homework problems are often more suited for earlier chapters. For example, there are exercise problems that are in the Random Sequences chapter that belong in the Random Variables chapter (or earlier). It is not worth the money! The reason it is widely used is because there are only 2-3 books on this subject (for grad students)!!!"
5,Being There: Vietnam War novel,"I found this to be an exciting Vietnam era war novel. Made me feel as though I was there, though I never was. Kudos to the author, who not only survived the conflict, but obviously had the fortitude and creativity to write this engaging book."
4,interesting play,I ordered this play because I was going to be in a performance of it.It served its purpose.I don't want to feel that anything that I order from Amazon will require a review.
4,Captivating Tunes,"Astounding harmonies, hypnotic, restful, great echo. I bought this as part of a boxed set and found myself listening to ""Aquitane"" to the exclusion of the other material. There is something comforting and familiar and strangely accessible. The fourth hymn, ""O Primus Homo Coruit,"" has a particularly appealing melody and engages the mystical in a way comparable to gazing at an elaborate stained glass window. ""Jube Domine, Puis Lecture: Primo Tempore"" will remind some of the scene in Monty Python & the Holy Grail when the monks chant and strike themselves with their Bibles. I like the first five selections best. Often play as I drift off to sleep."
5,Easy On the Sauce,"I use this product everyday after using the Nutribiotic Vanilla Chai Shower Gel. It really is a light, non-residue product, which helps to leave the hair soft and managable.Sign Me,ImpressedEveryday Clean Conditioner - 16 oz - Liquid"
3,Just your average coconut bra.,"Nothing fancy. Actually made of wood. What they send is what you get. Sizes and colors range from A cup to C cup, and a sand color to a chocolate brown.cheap and good for a good laugh or costume party. not very durable"
2,rough on the inside,"make sure you plan on wearing something underneath this. the inside of the coconuts are pretty rough, would definitely start to hurt over the course of a party."
3,This product is ok,"I didn't end up getting to wear the coconuts because the grass skirts I bought online from some other site claimed to be adult size, but were really child size. The kids wore the coconuts for a little bit but didn't care much for them either. I'm not sure why this is being considered a toy. lol I don't think it have any educational value, but that's just my opinion."
3,Nor for dogs,"The item is relatively well made, I just wish the manufacturer had made it clearer on the packaging that IT WILL NOT FIT ON A DOG."
3,Basic Nightlight,"Bought for my daughter after her previous nightlight broke. This one is more sturdy than many other Disney nightlights available on the market. If someone bumps into it, the light does not shatter into several pieces like her last one did."
2,The quality isn't there,"They quickly became pitted, and started showing signs of rust in a very short period of time. I would opt for solidstainless steel anchors in the future, realizing of course they're going to cost more."
2,NYC user,"great looking camera, easy to use BUT the hum picked up by the mic is so bad it negates all the other great features of the camera. I tried an external mic and it picked up noise too. If sound is important, this IS NOT the camcorder to buy."
1,"Nice looking camcorder, but Sony's customer service blew","four stars off this one. I got a C:31:23 error message when I insert a tape. It beeps and ask to eject the tape. When I eject the tape, it left the tape out all wrinkled up. The manual is no help to decipher the code. Why does it even display it if no one knows? Error code starts with ""C"" is self-servicable according to the manual. But it does not list all the codes obviously. The worst of all, after been put on hold for more than two hours, no one at their customer service takes the call and I finally gave up. I own many Sony products, this was the first time I tried to contact their customer service. It is just unbelievable. They dwarf the worst customer service experience you ever had. Why do they even have a phone number if no one answers it? Sony's customer service kills one's will to live. Take my advice, don't go there."
1,"Great DVD, Bad Book (Buy it used for cheap!)","The book sucks as it is highly inaccurate. But, the DVD is good. Buy it used for the DVD and ditch the book. If you're interested in May 4, 1970 I'd recommend ""The Truth About Kent State"" by Peter Davies or ""The Kent State Cover-Up"" by Joseph Kelner & James Munves."
1,DON'T BUY - EVEN FOR YOUR WORST ENEMY,"I confess I bought this book and WASTED MY MONEY. The books contains major factual errors. The author has minimal text - most of the book is simply a rehash and list of everything we already knew.I have read many books on the Kent State Murders and this is the only one which claims ""the soliders knelt down on the practice field, fired, and killed students."" This guy may have got this baloney past his editors at a newspaper but - it appears he was not there and did not perform the required research.He also chose a title for his book that was close to being borrowed from a book titled: ""Thirteen seconds: Confrontation at Kent State"" by Joe Eszterhas and was published in 1970.Seach for the book by Joe Eszterha - it is worth the money.=================Search finds:Thirteen seconds;: Confrontation at Kent State (Unknown Binding)by Joe EszterhasAvailability: Available from these sellers.15 used & new available from $9.98"
2,Video Game Music,"You know, time once was when JMJ influended others. Now it seems the whole video game ""culture"" is what is influencing him. The first three tracks on this disc sound like soundtracks to video games with all the depth and nuance you'd expect from such a connetion. You have to get to track 4 until you hear something that sounds like it might stand on its own and alongside JMJ's other greatest accomplishments. But by #8 we're back to video games again.Now, don't get me wrong. I've followed JMJ through lots of changes and usually been able to find something redeeming in most of them, but this might be my hopping off point.If you get the bonus 2nd disc with the video on it, you will see that the video game connection is very strong, maybe even intentional. It seems so shallow though. My overriding thought is ""what was he thinking?"""
3,Not too Bad for an old composer,"I am one of the fans of JMJ, so I bought this album despite the reviews I had read about it. This is of course not a smash hit album like oxygen 7-13. But not too bad either. Beautiful agony and Teo&Tea 4:00 am are the best in this album for me."
3,Jean-Michel shows he can follow,"With this album, Jean-Michel appears to say ""Not only can I lead the way, I can also follow my followers."" I call this conventional dance music. He shows he's better than most at using the tools of today for the disco beats they're made for, but there isn't much left of his organic hallmark sound here. I get the impression that this album represents a personal journey for Jean-Michel Jarre to catch up with the latest in studio technology, rather than an effort to write creative music. It's not bad, but it's not that good either."
1,"Good Night and Good Luck, Monsieur Jarre","...A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I am a big fan of JMJ's music, but I do think that is time for him to retire. Is better to live the music scene on a good note than... Adieu, Monsieur Jarre...Sorin Ionascu - Melbourne, Australia"
2,Jarre goes anonimous,"I have been listening to Jarre since I first heard Equinoxe in 1980, then caught up with Oxygene I somehow missed, continued with Magnetic Fields and so on... I became a huge fan and have always been influenced by Jarre in various degrees (making electronic music is a hobby of mine). The last few albums released were not up to his standard, but were to a large degree interesting experiments. This piece, however, sounds like a mediocre, anonymous demo for a music production software or a synth workstation. It completely lacks character and while not completely dismissible as a background music, it failed to produce ANY emotions... I will give it couple of more weeks to sink in, but I don't think it will get MUCH better than this."
4,Fresh album with the Jarre touch,"I'm a die hard Jarre fan! I've not missed one album, single (or even any bootlegs) to date :-)This album is obviously very different to Oxygen, Equinox, magnetic fields, and many of his early albums. However, the one thing that Jarre always managed to do, is to come up with weird sounds and ""melody-rise"" it!! Listen to what he did in e.g. Zoolook! This album is no different in that sense (though not nearly as experimental as Zoolook), this album retained the great musical ability of JMJ!!Furthermore I would say that the album is definitely a fresh approach from him, and even though the album is more beat driven and trance, Jarre managed to come up with sounds that really sound awesome!I personally enjoy this album a lot, and think that the album would be enjoyed by a much broader audience than just the Jarre die hard fans!"
5,Johnny IS Christmas!,"Since my early childhood, Johnny Mathis has truly been ""Christmas"" to me, and the holiday and season wouldn't be the same without his music! This is a wonderful collection of his work, and would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,Christmas must-have,"My all-time favorite singer, I absolutely love him and his music. For me, It just isn't Christmas without Johnny Mathis!"
2,Quite a disappointment...,"I must agree with the reviewer from Oklahoma. What a disappointment it is to see a 50th anniversary Christmas album from one of the greatest ambassadors of Christmas that gives us little that's new. I'm still waiting for a recording of a Christmas song that he sang and was only broadcast on Los Angeles radio stations twenty-some years ago called ""Christmas in the City of the Angels."" It was a wonderful song that for some reason never made it to any of his wonderful Christmas albums."
4,johnny mathis,This is a nice combination of Christmas songs. Johnny's smooth voice is great. I think this is a gret choice for anyone who likes Johnny Mathis.
2,Subdued performances,"All the performances on here are pretty subdued; it seems that Elvis never really cuts loose a la ""Burning Love"" or ""Promised Land"" which is disappointing. While the title track ""Raised on Rock"" is ok, it leaves you wishing they had pumped it up a notch or two. That song seemed like it was tailor made to be an Elvis rocker, but they didn't let the guitars and drums really go and as a consequence Elvis never really takes off on the song. That seems to be the case for the entire album. ""Three Corn Patches"" a country / blues song is the only song I found really interesting. Overall, I was expecting more from this album but was disappointed.Maybe ""Raised on Rock"" should be the next Elvis remix candidate. If they would pump-up the guitars and bass on that song, it might really rock."
5,Great Lessons from the Not-So-Dismal Science,"This is a terrific little book! [By the way, the author's name is not currently listed correctly by Amazon. There is only one author of this book and his name is Bruce Madariaga. He is an econ professor and Harvard grad with a fascinating educational story (see the book's preface).]Using everyday language, Professor Madariaga uses a large collection of examples to illustrate how basic economic concepts can be used by all of us to make better everyday decisions and to understand the world around us. I particularly liked the chapter of the book that debunks common myths about the world. Most lessons from the book are interesting, thought provoking, and practical. I highly recommend this book!"
1,Who recorded this MP3 for sale? Obviously not a human being...,"I hope I get my money back or I get the original CD, not the MP3. You need to know this music to be able to understand that there are conversations by Ruben Blades that very subtly blend into the beginning of songs. Sadly, the MP3 is fragmented, cut in pieces. This is not a regular music CD with clear cut endings and beginnings to songs, instead the author blended story telling with music. This CD is one of Ruben Blades greatest and it is such a shame that a computer cut the songs for sale as an MP3. Please, return my money or send me the original CD or ask a person that knows Ruben Blades music to record the MP3 and resend it to me. I grew up listening to Ruben Blades, I love all his songs :)"
5,Good Love!,"Although this song did not appear in South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut it was able to make its way on the soundtrack, and then to its own single. It's a very good song and I guarantee you it will get stuck in your head. This cd contains Good Love and is backed with What would Brian Boitano Do and Kyles Mom (Radio Edit). If you are a South Park fan or an Issacc Hayes fan you should order this single right now."
1,lasted about a month,"I had mine for less than a month when the antenna wire pulled away from the magnetic part of the antenna. -I have to qualify this by saying that I did not install the antenna per the instructions. Because I live in a bad neighborhood, I can't leave something like this on the car- it would get ripped off. So every night when I got home I would carefully remove the antenna and put in inside my trunk. After a few weeks of this, the wire broke off from the magnetic part of the antenna. The exact same thing happened to my wife's unit. Maybe this would not have happened if we had installed the antenna ""permanently"", but let this be a warning to anyone who thinks they will be able to take this type of antenna off/on.Now in our cars we are both using home antennas. We put them inside the rear window, which works very well."
4,"Great antenna, does the job well.","I had to replace my Sirius antenna after my car was damaged in an accident. I heard all the bad stories about the standard Sirius magnetic antennas and read great reviews about the Monster Cable MSR-ANT-CAR. I bought it and have been very happy with it. I don't get snow or much rain where I live, so I can't vouch for its performance in bad weather. I can say, however, that the signal on the Monster Cable MSR-ANT-CAR is strong, the sound is clear and the magnet stays put (even after many car washes). If you need a new/replacement antenna for your Sirius car player, this is a solid purchase."
4,Better than the Sirius mag mount,The Sirius supplied magnetic antenna never worked well from day 1 and got worse until I had a 'No Antenna Detected' display. The indoor antenna was used on the dash for a couple of weeks. I ordered the Monster MSR-ANT-CAR and have been extremely pleased with the performance to date. I gained 1-2 bars of signal and now rarely have signal drops. The Sirius antennas both had a habit of losing signal during the punch lines of jokes or stories...
1,too short for a shorty,"My daughter wanted a microphone on a stand for Christmas. This item was purchased. She is 5 years old and very small for her age. The microphone stand is way too small. There are no measurements on the box, and the pictures lead you to believe that it is taller than it is. Possibly the size for a three year old, but certainly not for ages 5-8. We are very disappointed, and will be returning this item and purchasing a larger one."
1,Let down,"My 4 and 5 year old girls LOVED this microphone and performed with it all day on Christmas day. However, the stand is WAY too short for a 5 year old, plus, our microphone quit working on the second day that we had it. Such a let down when your Christmas toy breaks the second day you have it. I would recommend purchasing a different karaoke machine."
3,Best Enemies Considered,"I give the book Best Enemies by Kathleen Leverich three stars because it's a great book. It's about two girls who meet one the first day of school and become enemies right away. One of the girls is Felicity Doll. Felicity is a snake and does some pretty mean things to Pricilla, who is the other girl. In the book Priscilla says she hates Felicity, but, I wasn't so sure about that. Felicity had taken Priscilla's desk, pencil case, and even her new sweater. Priscilla's sister Eve had warned her about Felicity Doll and told her to stay away from her. Instead, of listening to her sister. Priscilla, well...... read the book because I have said too much already. Hope you enjoy reading his book!"
2,unnatural dialogue,"if you can envision a town where the teachers, parents, and children don't believe in the use of contractions, then you have priscilla's town down cold. i can understand a writer's personal convictions might lead her to avoid contractions in the narrative, but what characters would really talk that way? ""i do not want to trade desks."" ""you do not want to be late for school."" ""i will not wear those shoes."" sounds very unnatural and it ruined the book for me. and who says contractions are bad, anyway? your great-gramma?"
4,The book of Leviticus,"I haven't finished this book yet but I do really like what I have read. Although you really need to concentrate on what you read, it helps you to distinguish between the different sacrifices and to more fully understand them."
3,meh,"[...].this release is rather ghetto. it has two separate versions of the movie, one hardsubbed with chinese audio and another with no subs and dubbed. rather than taking the time to do subs properly they just threw in a hardsubbed version which of course leaves less room on the disc for a single, quality video track. if there is any other reason they did this it is not noted on the box. i suppose its possible the hardsubbed version looks better in parts but nothing i noticed. if this is the case they should have noted something about it."
5,Sir Kay Is A Winner!,"This is the tale of Sir Kay, otherwise known as King Arthur's seneschal and foster brother. This is not about the cardboard Kay we hear about in so many other novels. This story puts a face and a personality on the name. Kay is portrayed as a genuine human being with faults and virtues. Unfortunately, his virtue is one of his faults and he is charged with the murder of Loholt, King Arthur's illegitimate son.He is banished from Camelot and his knighthood taken away. He tries to save Arthur from his enemies, Briant and his enchantress Brisane, who wish to have Camelot and Britain as their own. Kay is trying to redeem himself in his eyes and Arthur's.This is a fast-moving story that will keep you riveted from page to page! You'll also have a new appreciation for Sir Kay with this fresh new insight of author Cherith Baldry."
2,Came in damaged,"I was excited to receive this book in the mail for my english class. I hear nothing but great review on the book itself, and wouldn't hesitate to buy this if you don't care about presentation. But, my copy came in bent with a big indent across the cover. It's spine also was poorly glued , causing deep wrinkles along the spine. Also, the cover art is not the man you see in the picture no complaints about that). In the end, I returned it and asked for a replacement, if it is again damaged I will be going to barnes and nobles."
2,Nothing special,"A man kills two women with a hatchet. That's the center story of this book whose character's names are very easy to remember (take Rodion Romanovitch Raskolkinoff, for example, also known as Rodia, or Peter Petrovitch Looshin who is not the same person as Porphyrius Petrovitch). The author reflects the psychological implications of this murder in a very detailed way, although he could have done it in 200 pages less, with the same effect. In my opinion, the novel is too dull and too predictable and you get lost in names."
2,THANK GOD IT'S FINISHED,"I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO KEEP READING THIS NOVEL. I ASSUMED THAT A NOVEL THAT HAD GOTTEN TO THE STATUS OF ""CLASSIC"" WOULD BE A TERRIFIC NOVEL. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. EVERY EXCITING PAGE IN THE BOOK WAS FOLLOWED BY 50 PAGES OF TEDIOUS NOTHING. I AM AN AVID READER AND USUALLY FINISH A NOVEL IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. THIS TOOK ME TWO WEEKS TO FINISH. I COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT TO END.UNLESS YOU HAVE TO READ THIS FOR A CLASS DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
5,A Work of Art,"This is a true masterpiece. The intensity of the psychological ordeals of the main character Raskolnikov is unrelenting. A fascinating insight into the tenement life of Saint Petersburg. This book has remained a firm favourite! The Penguin Classics version is, as usual, a quality production."
1,Piece of Crap,"Wow, just wow. I loved the thing for about 6 months tops. Then it started to have problems. Firstly, it will not play half of the songs i copy on to it (this is without dropping it and using its piece of crap software). Secondly its friggin huge for a 1.5 Gig mp3 player. Thirdly nearly all the songs i copy onto it are not tagged right. fourthly the stupid thing uses playlists to copy. The list goes on and on and on. Oh and the customer support is also a piece of crap. The only reason I still have it is because it was a gift to me. Stay away."
5,Goofy Games,"I loved the Monkey Island games. When I bought Escape from Monkey Island years ago, I loved it so much I tracked down the older games and tried to force my new computer to play them. It did not play the first one, because it was just not compatible. Too bad. This is one of the silliest games I've ever played and I mean that in the best possible way. The goofy humor, the silly characters, and the fun puzzle type action make this one of my favorite video games ever. Now if they'd just make another one..."
3,"Fun, but much worse than the other 3","All I have to say is ""Monkey Kombat"" what a horrible, horrible way to end a game. Since when is copious note taking any fun? Lucas Arts tried to replace the amusing insult fighting with this drivel and it failed miserably. The overall game itself also pales in comparision to the stellar 3 games leading up to this one. Quite average, even for a monkey island fan. Monkey Island fans, pick this one up and suffer through the bad parts, but everyone else stay the hell away."
4,"Good, but not as good as the last one.","I enjoyed this game, I really did. However, I liked Curse of Monkey Island better. Why? Well, for one I found the climax of this game rather lame and silly. Can't say more than that without giving stuff away.Also, I was annoyed by the unnecessary system requirement inflation. In my opinion, the ""animated movie"" look of the last installment fit this series PERFECTLY. Pushing this one into 3D added nothing to the gameplay, and made the look WORSE, in my opinion. All it did was raise the system requirements for no reason at all, just because ""EVERY new game MUST be 3D!!!!"""
3,Monkey Island is the best.,"Monkey Island is awesome. With this being said, hands down this is the weakest link in the series thus far. The game play and graphics really take away from the Monkey Island experience. The graphics on ""The Curse of..."" are great and the gameplay of ""The Secret of..."" are lacking in this attempt. This is no banjo duel or spitting contest for sure."
4,A delicious little tidbit,"Escape to Monkey Island is the last in the Monkey Island series and it is a follow up to the Curse of Monkey Island in which Guybrush and Elaine were married. In this game, trouble is afoot. The Governor's mansion is being torn down, LeChuck is back and he is looking for a vile vodoo talisman called the Ultimate Insult. This horrific weapon will make anyone's soul a permanent egoless lump of goop. Help Guybrush to oust this wicked demon pirate and save Elaine. I gave this game a 4 because at one point the game froze and some of the puzzles like finding Tiny Lafeet's hat, the boulder puzzle, and the Matrimonial Lava Plunge were pretty annoying. Overall, this is a pretty good game."
5,From a Hector Lavoe fan,"This is ""La Voz"" in his later years but still con mucho sabor. You get a little of everything on this album. From very poetic and stylistic boleros like ""Comedia"" and ""Porque Te Conocí?"" to swinging, true to salsa songs like ""Songorocosongo"", ""La Verdad"" and the samba-tinged ""Tiempos Pasados"". As if that weren't enough, you have Lavoe's classic, classic song ""El Cantante"", written Ruben Blades. 10 minutes of why Hector Lavoe IS El Cantante de los cantantes. To finish off the set, you have another true to salsa number entitled ""Bandolera"". Pianist Gilberto 'Pulpo' Colon, Jr. takes a tremendous, extended piano solo on this one and, as always, Hector is soñando with mastery.This album has everything you need all in one package. Hector Lavoe should be named El Sonero Mayor and not Ismael Rivera (Perdoname, Maelo)."
1,hard as a rock! definitely not khol or crayon,"very disappointed in this product! Especially since the Mavala brand has a good reputation based on what I read before buying this product from Amazon.I use khol liners all the time on my inner lids. They are supposed to be somewhat soft, and easy to use for lining, both on your inner eyelid and around your eyes. I was looking for a green in addition to the black that I normally use. Most khol (kajal) products are black, so I was happy to find this green khol liner on amazon. But when I got it, it was very hard, and hard to use even as a regular pencil liner. I have to press hard to even draw a line on the back of my hand. Too bad - the green color is pretty. I am going to end up tossing it. I will not bother wasting money on the Mavala brand again."
4,singer/songwriter with passion,"Audrey Auld Mezera is a singer songwriter who has the passion in her heart to produce music just as the first song on her album ""Texas"" says, `She loves it like the earth, moon and sun'. What a passionate and thought provoking singer songwriterThis is a tribute album, about the people who have influenced her such as Woody Guthrie, Harlan Howard, Billy Joe Shaver, Karla Faye Tucker, The Dead Ringer Band, Fred Auld (dad) and husband Mez. . The admiration and sincere gratitude shows through and inspired Audrey to write moving lyrics with emotions and feelings blending with musical excellence to satisfy the most ardent critic.This CD is a must for any collector of quality contemporary country roots music."
3,Texas Review,"Sort of like Losing Faith - some good, some kinda slow and plodding, some with great lyrics. I definitely like the artist."
5,Audrey Auld Mezera is the real thing.,"TexasAudrey Auld Mezera, I've been a fan for a couple of years. I have seen her perform live many times and as much as I love that she is with her lovely hubby in USA, I can only wait to see her back in Oz. I fell in love with TEXAS, the moment I heard it. You can hear the passion in her heart as she sings her music, the first track ""Love You Like The Earth"" on Texas is just great. What more can I say other than if you love country music this CD and her others are necessary on your list. Audrey is the real thing."
3,APUS_KM,"At the time of Sinclair's writing, the food safety standards and the enforced codes for safe working conditions were almost completely abandoned. One critic has stated that ""Sinclair's work was better left to reporters, but these were precisely the type of stories that reporters would not tell."" Published at a time in which there were not writers designated to investigate and report significant issues occurring in an unaware society, muckrakers like Sinclair exposed the problems with the industrial machine, particularly in this industry, and inadvertently began to lead reform in this area. The novel does an incredible job of relaying the gravity of the problem through its somewhat graphic but very realistic descriptions and of opening the American public to this legitimate concern while simultaneously prompting the movement of response that was becoming so very necessary."
3,The jungle,"This was a somewhat difficult book for me to read. I found it very slow alot of the time but that aside, it is very interesting and very sad. I am glad I read it."
4,"Informative, but Flawed","I appreciated the effort by Mr. Sinclair, but I was puzzled by the serious lack of judgment exhibited by ""our hero"" Jurgis. He had left Chicago having hardly any ties remaining there, and subsequently returned (for reasons unclear to me) right before winter. Jurgis was a victim of his own emotions, and ended up getting himself thrown into jail. Certainly, this ""hero"" was not perfect for engendering sympathy for the masses.However, the descriptions of conditions at the meat packers and the treatment of the workers was very effective, as reflected by regulations later instituted by government. I think we're probably still working on the treachery of the politicians.One of the prologues told me that I would be told that capitalism could never prevail. I don't remember reading that explanation. Perhaps I missed it.One hundred years later we are struggling with many of the same problems of the jungle. Kudos to Mr. Sinclair for his attempt."
3,"It was a good book, but the last few chapters were confusing.","I thought the book was good. It had a great storyline and it's written in such a way that I really felt sorry for what the charcters were going through. When I finished reading the last few chapters I felt that they had nothing to do with the storyline really, and was just trying to push the ideas of socialism on you. The book would have been a lot better if they explained what was going to happen to the characters more, and got rid of the chapters on socialism. No offense to those who are socialist or believe in socialism though. I just thought the chapters on it just didn't work with the storyline really."
3,Finishing this book is like raking muck,"I gave this book three stars, primarily because of the historical significance attached to it; if judged solely on literary merit, it'd be one star. The Jungle is populist propaganda, and, like all propaganda, is so self-consciously manipulative as to be ridiculous. Never there lived a more star-crossed fella than Jurgis Rudkos...based on his luck, one can't pinpoint the stockyards as the prime mover of his downfall. He was doomed no matter what. Sinclair abuses his main character with innumerable tragedies, misfortunes, calamities, reverses, and disasters, to the extent that he loses all semblance of reality. Valuable as an historical artifact, but no more."
3,Interesting Book,"But the ending is absurd considering that the ""capitalist industrialists"" are in fact socialists themselves (Carnegie, Morgan, Rothschild, Roosevelt, etc.) and that dehumanizing factories were not built until the era of socialist control over politics, economics, education, etc. (easily the Gilded Age but honestly back to the French Revolution).Traditional, conservative economies had citizens who provided for themselves from the land or in the towns from an established craft whereas the machine-driven modern economy not only employs fewer individuals in any real meaningful labor but also deprives most people of the means for taking care of their families (landless wage slaves who know nothing of traditional life)."
3,Days Gone Bye,"In the back of my mind I have always credited Upton Sinclair with the fact that I don't smoke! I remembered that he wrote a book called ""The Jungle"" that was very critical of the meat packing industry. I remember he was also critical of the large corporations that, among other things, tried to get young people to smoke knowing they would become life long customers. Corporations haven't changed except the products have changed. The story is told through the eyes of an ordinary working man. The book was originally written in the early 1900's but was cut and expurgated by the publisher. Recently, a Tucson, Arizona publisher published the original, uncensored, version. If you are interested in any of these things, or in the beginnings of Socialism you may find this book worthwhile."
2,The Truth About the American Industrial Revelution,"This book is about Jurgis Rudkis, a Lithuanian, who comes to America to get his fortune. Unfortunatly, a series of events leaves him poor and in jail. He witnesses many disgusting and unfair things that sadly, many times really happened. He ends becoming a hobo and living in the country. His family is torn apart and seperates, leaving him alone in the world.I would recommend this book to people who like history and government because much of this book is based on things that happened in the government and history of Packingtown in the 19th century.I thought this book was boring. I felt that the plot of the story had no point and that it dragged on through the book."
1,Stupid Sinclair,"I cant believe anyone would say that this book is a ""great work"". from what i know of my schoolmates, NONE of them would agree with that statement, and certainly many of the adults that i have contact with feel the same way... with the exception of my idiot english teacher."
4,Campy & Spooky,"I know.....I know.....it's a little goofy but it's still kind of creepy. Especially, the doll segment."
4,FUN!FUN!FUN!,"This has got to be one of the funnest movies I have ever seen. It's creepy, atmospheric, and suspenseful. The first tale, JULIE, gives the movie a great start with a suspenseful story and twisted ending. The movie however does begin to drift a bit with the second story, MILLICENT AND THERESE, although the ending might surprise some. I guessed it though. The third story,AMELIA, is by far the best thing in the world. I had the most fun in years watching the little zuni doll running around the apartment, chasing after Karen Black. I couldn't stop laughing. It was the funniest thing I have ever seen! That doll is one evil little dude. You'll find yourself laughing hysterically and begging for more. The closing sequence is truly disturbing!"
3,BUYER BEWARE...,"Funky, effectively creepy little movie from the 70's. Highly recommend. However - don't allow yourselves to be ripped-off by sellers on eBay or elsewhere, selling this title for more than a hundred bucks a pop; a remastered ""Special Edition"" is supposedly on it's way for release in 2006. So just be patient, folks. All good things come to those who wait. Your significant other (and your wallet) will thank you..."
4,It amazing how we remember the original,"For years, my wife had been going on and on about how great this movie was when she was a kid. ""The best horror movie ever!"", I think was her standard quote. One day she conned me into buying the DVD. I did. While the quality of the DVD was quite good, the impact on the audiance (my wife) was less than stellar. I think my wife was a bit dissapointed when she realized that viewing this movie through the eyes of her childhood was quite different than viewing it as an adult."
4,zuni warrior goes sushi chef on an avocado samsonite,"for fans, of the doll, search on amazon under mp3 downloads for ""rick kaley and the menacing mutants"" - there's a song about the zuni warrior called ""fetish doll""- very cool! karen black is terrific! top drawer cheese!"
5,Scared Numb!!!,"As most viewers, I saw this for the first time when I was a kid. Thinking back, I wish my parents hadn't let me watch it (ok, not really), because during and after the Zuni sketch, my legs went somehow numb from sheer fright! I was terrified! Even years later, my folks would mess with me if I wasn't behaving by making those doll sounds, and I would freak out and fly right! Over the years, we always rented it for Halloween, watching the first two somewhat lame segments just to build up to the grand finale...the ever-dreaded Zuni fetish doll...scares me just to type out that name! Still don't like dolls of any kind to this day...ok, back to the rubber room I go."
5,Halloween fave,I was excited to find a copy of the movie I'd heard so much about. I watched it with my family and we had a great time talking about the movie.
5,Amazing Movie.Anchor Bay.PLEASE bring back a Special Edition DVD!,"I remember watching this as a kid and the next day EVERYONE at school was talking about that Scary Killer Doll with the Teeth.I have loved Horror and Sci'Fi movies ever since.I recently got this on DVD(at an OUTRAGEOUS secondary price),but it was worth it!Karen Black is an AMAZING actress with great range.She is VERY good in ALL 3 short stories.Of course the third story,Amelia,(The Zuni Doll)is the best.Black shows her acting chops and handles the material very well.The Zuni Doll's Special Effects are done EXTREMELY WELL also.They even hold up today.I read that 2 scenes were cut from the film(One explaining why Black knows to get a knife to open the bent lock on her door,I am guessing the scene showed the Doll bending it,to keep her locked in,and the other scene is the doll attacking Black even more).I wish Anchor Bay would find them and do a Special Edition with Karen Black,and everyone else invloved with the movie."
2,Julie / Millicent and Therese / Amilia,"Okay, so, my mom and I are walking through Blockbuster, and we see this movie, and she's like, ""Watch this."" As it turns out, she and her cronies first watched this movie in college when it premiered on TV and had to turn it off cuz it was too scary. So I get home and go upstairs to watch it, expecting to be really scared, cuz my mom's a pretty brave gal. Boy, was I wrong! This movie wasn't scary, it was just whacked!!! I found myself laughing out loud when the little Voodoo Guy was attacking Karen Black. Is it just me, or does he sound like Donald Duck at times? So to wrap things up, I would you rent recommend TRILOGY OF TERROR if there is nothing else in.P.S. The twist at the end of the 2nd story is really unexpected.P.P.S. Even though this movie is not rated, I would not recommend showing it to young children.P.P.P.S. If you want to see a really good movie with Karen Black, see ""Family Plot"".Thank You."
2,CHEESY!,if you enjoy laughing at stuff that use to scare you as a kid. you need to watch this. Karen Black gives great performaces in a three story triglogy that did horrfy me when i was a kid now I could watch and enjoy at the sheer cheese of it all.
2,not that scary,"this movie is really not that scary. The first two stories are kinda boring. No scary stuff, no blood, no nothing interesting. The third story is a little bit boring too, but it's the best out of all three. If you seen trilogy of terror 2, then you know the doll has loud yells, and there is a part where you see the doll kill a guy, and there's blood. In trilogy of terror, all it shows is the doll chasing amelia around the apartment trying to kill her and stabbing her a few times. The end of the movie is the best part of the movie. after the doll burns in the oven, amelia opens it to see if it's dead and she gets possessed. she then calls her mom and tells her to come over and amelia waits in front of the door pounding a knife on the ground with a creepy look and CREEP-AY teeth. If you want scary see trilogy of terror 2. It's way more scarier than the first, and the stories are interesting and cool."
1,I guess I'm not 10 anymore,"This movie is no different than it was 35 years ago, but I'm not the same age so for me, this was a waste of money. I thought it a classic and that it might be fun to watch, but it was just too old to be entertaining anymore."
5,Scarey Horror,"This is a very good suspenseful movie, the fact that it takes place mostly in an apratment puts you on edge, it has suspense and the horror keeps you until thevery end."
5,Time To Hide The Steak Knives And Put Your Feet Up On The Sofa,"This has to be without doubt, the scariest made for tv 70's cult film of all time.Each tale is different and Karen Black milks each role for all it's worth with the last story a real zinger to cap it offI love Karen Black, she is an actress you just don't ever forget and in this film even more so.If Karen is remembered mostly by horror fans for this entry she can be well assured that her performance was top notch, thanks for wrestling with that little Zuni doll Karen, you scared the heck out of us baby boomers in doing so."
4,Pretty bold for early 70's TV,"The first time I saw this film was when I was in the 7nth or 8th grade in the early 1970's. The day after it aired it was the ""talk"" of the school! Everyone was ""blown away"" by the Zuni fetish doll short. This was around the time I think that the TV show ""Night Gallery"" had also aired a ""living doll"" episode. The short ""Julie"" really shows the acting range that Karen Black was capable of. ""Milicent and Therese"" was the weakest of the 3. I can't remember wheather I figured it out before the end, but by modern standards most audiences will I think. All in all a very cool film with not a lot of budget."
5,Fade To Black...,"Karen Black (Burnt Offerings) burned herself into my memory w/ this 1975 TV anthology! For 30 years I remembered the Zuni fetish doll in the AMELIA segment, unable to recall much about the first two stories. Well, I just watched TOT again tonight, and I liked all three tales. While AMELIA is still my favorite, I found both JULIE and MILLICENT AND THERESE to be creepy and fun. Karen Black is a chameleon, changing from stuffy college professor- to evil murderess- to prim and proper prude to seductress, then terrified victim, and finally into savage huntress, all in under 80 minutes! Dan Curtis (Night Stalker, Night Strangler) allows Ms. Black to show off her talent for making the strangest material seem believable, while letting her carry the whole thing almost single-handed! This is one of those rare TV horror masterpieces that the 70s churned out. Like DUEL, NIGHT STALKER, THE DEAD DON'T DIE, etc., TRILOGY OF TERROR made it's mark. I'm glad to see it back on DVD..."
5,Scary as hell!,"I've never actually seen the first one , but my parents say I walked in on them watching it when I was two. I ran out screaming in the parking lot when I saw the zuni doll , and when they caught me I hid under my bed. My mom told me it was the same as the sequel just better, so I know it must be great!"
4,Fun and Creepy!,"You can't really say this is a ""great"" movie - the first two stories couldn't possibly hold a candle to the third one - but the third story makes the movie all worth wild. It's loads of fun to watch and it's also very creepy! And if you don't like it, it's great to make fun of. Be sure to check out this one!P.S. The sequel's pretty good too."
5,"Trilogy of Terror ""The Doll""","Over 20 yrs. has passed since I have seen this intense movie and I have not forgotten it. I vaguely remember the other 2 stories but this one sticks in my mind the most. A voodoo doll with a little knife terrorizis a lady after accidently losing the chain on the doll. This movie has many surprises and a very wierd and disturbing ending. This movie is a must see, however, make sure you watch it with no expectations whatsoever and you will enjoy it immensly (or at least find yourself having nightmares)."
4,old school,"when i was younger I hated when this movie came on, because you cant take your eyes away and karen black, wow its just very creepy, it really made me think about dolls."
5,"As ""Wonderful, Wonderful"" as Ever!!",Excellent CD and a must for all Mathis fans. Johnny sounds as mellow as ever!!!
5,Classic,"I did not grow up with Johnny Mathis... heard him on CBS Sunday Morning and wanted to hear more. This definitely gave me more! I hope you enjoy songs from Wonderful, Wonderful and Chances Are to Over The Rainbow (w/ Ray Charles). Great collection!"
4,Like old times.,"I love all the oldies - he sounds wonderful, and they bring back great memories. I don't, however, care for the last 2 songs on the CD. They are new to me, and I don't like the content or melody of either."
2,"Okay, but......","Yes, this CD has all the richness and lush sound for Johnny's songs that are included here. However for those of us who were fortunate to witness his 50th Anniversary Concert, the best song, ""HANDS DOWN"" was ""Brazil"" and also ""Pure Imagination"", neither of which are on this CD. This may be a 50th Anniversary Celebration, but if we are going to celebrate, let's include some of his lesser known, but still outstanding songs...and no, I will not be purchasing this CD."
5,Perfect Mathis,"A man who's voice never ages and his music never gets old. One of the better ""anniversary collections"" ever."
5,If Frank Was Chairman of the Board-Johnny Is CEO,Outstanding collection from a World Class career. Johnny Mathis was/is/will always be amazing. I know once a person falls in love with a song they usually like it forever but in Johnny's case it goes beyond that to include a warm memory that is the same today as it was 40 years ago when you first heard it
5,Johnny Mathis; A 50th Anniversary Celebration,"Johnny Mathis has been the greatest make-out singer since the 50's and I certainly have been making out with his music in the background for many years and will enjoy his singing forever, even though my late wife cannot listen with me, we will continue to love his songs for eternity.. Thank You; L.W.GEER JR. 10 stars for MATHIS"
4,Exquisitely Experimental,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that this CD is a hand numbered limited edition of 1999, plus it's signed by Sheila Chandra. Apparently this is the first part of a two part series for Indi Pop, both limited edition releases. The music is much more experimental than her work on the RealWorld label. If you're looking for something to help you view Sheila as the innovator she is... buy it. Also, the CD lists 6 tracks, but there are actually 8."
5,The best EKG book ever.,"The only EKG book, the best EKG book, and the simplest EKG book you will ever need. If you are having a hard time reading EKGs you won't once you finish this book!"
5,Lives up to its name,"This book is laid out well and is easy to understand. It's plentifully illustrated, fully explained, and full of in-depth info. I personally have no medical background at all and am halfway through the book, confidently completing each worksheet and understanding each chapter. You will need a dictionary at first, to look up words like 'ischemic' and 'anterior', but it is well worth the effort to read this book.I do recommend buying the print copy rather than the Kindle version (which is of the 2nd Edition). The illustrations become difficult to see, even with magnification, at least on my Kindle Touch. I've only read a sample of the revised 2nd edition, but if anything it seems even easier to understand."
4,Very helpful but some things have changed...,"Having just taught in two major Chinese universities, I found this book very helpful. But based on my conversations with numbers of students (at undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate level), in today's competitive China some things appear to have changed. E.g. granted the diversity of a vast country like China, in those cities that have been more impacted by Western consumer culture there is much more individualism especially among youth. At the more prestiguous universities intense competition means that fewer students are as willing to assist their colleagues as their more traditional counerparts might have once been. Highly recommended (even for tourists) but do be aware of the increasing impact of Western culture."
4,An overview of what to expect living and working in China.,"This 192 page paperback book is an overview of what to expect for anyone who will be travelling to China to negotiate, work, teach, study, engage in diplomacy, and/or live. Of uniqueness is that this book is co-authored by an American and a Chinese. Together, they bring the insight of Chinese culture together with an American's perspective. As a result, this is one of the better such overview books."
5,Genius,My new favorite album. Wild psychedelic riffs with hints of Nirvana and the Stones. Unbelievable percussion.
5,Battery Charging!,"I only became a rabid fan of Love Battery about two years ago. I was exposed to a short clip of them performing the song Right Between the Eyes while watching the Seattle Music Documentary ""Hype"" That short snipit of that song inspired me to go out and seek my first L.B. CD purchase which was ""Straight Freak Ticket"". I was floored! I soon purchased my next L.B. CD which was Dayglo. I was stunned! I just bought my third L.B. CD ""Confusion A Go Go"" I was Blown Away! I only have two other artist in my extensive music library that have three great CD's. And I havn't even got all of Love Battery's yet!"
3,I wouldn't pay list price...,Contains 50-60 monsters but feels like a lot less. Basically very few of these monsters jump out at or inspire me. I might use two or three of them at most. The Monkey God was a fun read though and the highlight of this book. Save your money for larger and more interesting monster compendiums and put an asian twist on them yourself.
3,Good and bad,"Let's start off with the good:Some really cool new monsters (mostly undead and shapechangers).Some really cool artwork.Now the bad:Some not very usable (although interesting) monsters.Some old monsters just redone (zombies, giants, dryads etc...)Some really bad artwork.Too many dragons (yes I realize that ""Jade Dragons"" is part of the title, but my characters just don't fight that many dragons)I would suggest this for anyone running an oriental campaign setting. But if you're just looking for new monsters, it may not be worth it."
4,Very nice new monsters that trigger adventure hooks,"First the bad,If you are looking for more then monsters, tough break, there is nothing but monsters here.The good,Though black-and-white, the artwork is very nice and the presented monsters do all have a decent picture. To make life easy on the DM, all monsters have a well enough documented past. Monsters come in all kind of varietys, from CR 1/2 to well over 20. Combining this with the Oriental Adventures book, gives you some great possibilitys."
1,Never received this item- poor business.,"It is not that I rate the CD 1 star- it is that I still have never received the CD or a response to my inquiry about the status of my order. I do not recommend doing business with this company. Furthermore, since it has been over a month since I placed this order, I am now filing a report with Amazon."
1,she's a thief,"when i heard her song breathe on the radio, i almost had a heart attack. her ""big"" single breathe was stolen from a favorite band of mine called greenwheel. i hope ppl come to realize that just because an artist is a big headliner, she can steal a song from an indie band[greenwheel was just recently signed] and commercialize it and make money off of it. this is unexcusable."
3,Breathe is a remake,"If you like the song ""Breathe"" go out and by the band that actually wrote the song and give them credit, where credit is due. The band who wrote this song is ""GREENWHEEL"" the name of the cd is Soma Holiday. This cd is a 5 star cd."
5,It's just what I expected,"I agree with the other reviewers that almost every song on this album could be a hit single. Melissa does a great job of picking the right songs for this album. This includes fast, slow or hard rock songs. Even the one that she didn't write, ""Breathe,"" she does a great job of. I don't know why an earlier reviewer was complaining why she included ""Breathe."" So what if someone else wrote or recorded it first? The album really flows from one track to the next, meaning each track is so good that you don't think of skipping over one to get to the next. Too bad she released this album right after the Grammys, or she would have a shot at Best Female Vocal or Album of the Year."
1,Who is the secret agent?,"The anticipation was great but the album was a breakdown. When will the rock and roll days of old return to her music? I feel like I'm listening to her sessions with her shrink. The last two albums have the same tired themes...a broken heart, the pain of the old relationship, the dance of starting a new relationship and the heart that has been healed by the new relationship. Where is the tension in this album? The only song that reminds me of her earlier days is Secret Agent..but it's Melissa Etheridge who is playing the secret agent...pretending to produce a rock and roll album. Joplin would be ashamed."
4,Etheridge always delivers....but,"I was watching an interview of Melissa Etheridge today on CNN and was amazed to hear a song that I loved and never thought I would hear it in any media outlet. Why? Because the song I heard was ""Breathe"", it was originally *written* and released by a band GREENWHEEL on their ""Soma Holiday"" cd in 2002/2003. So while I like Melissa Etheridge as much as anyone, and love her version of this track, I just wanted to make sure Greenwheel got some of the credit they deserved. The Greenwheel CD is also very good and highly recommend it."
3,BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!,"I'm a huge fan of all Melissa Etheridge's stuff but, this album just doesn't cut it. It's dissappointing both lyrically and musically. I rarely listen to this cd. I give it 3 stars because I do like In This Moment, When You Find The One, Giant, Secret Agent and Meet Me In The Dark. However, nothing on this album could ever possibly top her previous efforts such as Bring Me Some Water, Ain't It Heavy, It's For You, Come To My Window, Yes I Am, Breakdown, Stronger Than Me, The Different, Lover Please, the list goes on and on. I think I like Melissa better when she's a little bitter, jaded and out of love! Better LUCK next time!"
3,Well...,"I've bought every single Melissa CD out there, from singles and albums to dvd's.This is by far the worst.Lyrically she is great as usual, but this CD is missing the catchy element of the rest of her CD's. I don't feel that this CD has the raw emotion her previous CD's have.If Melissa needs to be in emotional pain to write music like she has been doing, please someone break her heart!"
2,"Good, Not great","I would describe this record as a ""good effort"" However, it lacks the fire and passion of her previous releases. It sounds like Melissa has gone ""easy listening"" with this one. The songs seem unfocused, and lack direction. I don't care for all the computerized, sampled drum beats. The lyrics are well written, but are worthless without strong melodies to go with them. I've been a fan since I was 17 years old.....This release to me was a big let down."
1,Just Don't Get It,"I should start out by saying I have all of Melissa Etheridge's previous CD's and I love all of them for different reasons! However, ""Lucky"" was the worst disappointment in music I had in years!! Everyone I guess deserves one melt down CD in their career this would be hers. Out of 13 tracks there was not one I would play again! It is not rock, it's not blues, I don't think it's even ""new country"" I can't say though I don't listen to country much. I don't know what it is the lyrics are too repetitive, and they rhyme all over the place. If this is your FIRST CD by Melissa Eheridge don't let it be your LAST! Listen to her other releases! I'm very sorry I wasted my money on ""LUCKY"""
1,Skip this one,"I was not impressed with the songs, lyrics or Melissa on this album. I am a big fan, but not of Lucky."
4,Great set of songs,"I was anticipating this album for a long time, especially after SKIN, which was an amazing outpouring of emotion from Melissa Etheridge. LUCKY follows that emotional outpouring, only this time it's love. ""Breathe"" is a great song, even though it's a cover, she did a great job and really makes it her own without ruining the original. ""This Moment"" is going to be a hit I can just feel it, it has hit written all over it. ""If You Want To"", ""Mercy"", ""Secret Agent"", are all great rockin kind of songs. ""When You Find The One"", ""Meet Me In The Dark"", ""Will You Still Love Me"", and many others, are loving ballads. Overall a great album!"
4,Whoa...Melissa's Got her Groove Back!,"This album almost makes me want to go hungry to save up for tickets to her LA concert. I'm still in love with her acoustic playing and I will always want more, but this album is really, really good. Kiss Me drives and is sexy like ""I'm the Only One.""I didn't like Skin or Breakdown that much but there are some songs on this album that really rock. Melissa will always be my Bruce Springsteen!"
3,Good,"This is a good album, though not her best work, still a good album.The song ""Breathe"" is a cover song. It was written and originally recorded by a St. Louis band called Greenwheel on their album Soma Holiday. I love their version so much more."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"Dont believe the bad reviews of other people on here! I love Melissa and all her CD's and I think this is one of the best! I think its far better than SKIN, if that says anything. And there are plent of great tracks, especially 6 and 10. Just Awesome!"
3,Not up to par,"As a huge Melissa fan I awaited this release w/ anticipation only to listen to the album a few times and find myself disapointed. There's nothing creatively/artistically new here. In fact, several of the songs sound very similar to her earlier songs, just slightly different beat, slightly different words. As a whole this album does not live up to Melissa's rock standards.I'll wait in anticipation to see if her next album will excite me the way all her albums prior to this did."
3,One Great Song,"This cd is good but mostly predictable down to certain phrases and very familiar beats and baselines . . . EXCEPT ""Secret Agent"" and to some extent,""Tuesday Morning"" (the really cool feel of this song does not match the serious theme). Both higlight the band, such as it is, especially the drummer who is the unsung hero in all cds. If you are a fan, as I am (have all her cds and seen her 4 times in concert) you must have this cd if only for Secret Agent . . play it loud!"
5,Melissa is HAPPY again! The music speaks for itself.,"Thank god Melissa has found peace and happiness, because albums like ""Skin"" (awful) and ""Breakdown"" were not near as much fun as Melissa's earlier stuff. Melissa is back to her easy going self and this album proves it. So many of these songs are rip the top down and push the pedal to the metal songs. The 1st song ""Lucky"" is just pure fun. ""Breathe"" has that catchy chorus that will not leave your head, and ""Tuesday Morning"" is a somber, yet real statemement about the events of 09/11. In a time when so many artists are selling out, using 09/11 as their cash cows, Melissa chooses instead to make an artistic statement through music. The song is not radio friendly itself, but there are plenty others to get your foot tappin' and your heart soaring. What a FUN collection."
4,Melissa Rocks!,"I love this CD! Not all the songs are Melissa's best. But after the last 2 darker, solemn CD releases, this one begins to rock again. True Melissa style-like only she can do!"
2,What a dudd,"I was so in love with Moss's previous books that I scooped this book up without even looking at the contents, wanting a quite place to savor the work of a master. Silly me. These are not the timeless classics of her previous books. Instead of her trademark texture with subtle motif coupled with wonderfully detailed styling, we have ugly overbearing designs against mostly ho-hom sweaters. Did I mention the socks and afgans? Yuck. There are a couple of nice sweaters, but nothing to motivate me to pluck down $150 in yarn and spend months knitting. Ironically, Vogue featured an original pattern that was based on one of the sweaters in the book and it is far better then the one it is based on and much nicer then anything in this book. Save your money and hunt down one of her earlier books."
2,Not patterns you want to knit,"A disapointment after her previous ""classics"" book and her published patterns. Maybe Ms. Moss wanted a write-off for her trip through Africa and the Middle East, but I'm not inclined to help fund it. The designs in this book are (with the exception of one sweater vest) not the kind of thing you would actually WEAR anyplace (including Casual Fridays), regardless of how interesting they may be to craft as a technical exercise. Frankly, as a working mom I just don't have time for knitting ""exercises,"" which may explain my frustration with the book. Most of the designs suffered from some very unfortunate choices with regard to the colorways. There are some interesting ""bits"" of designs and constructions that you might be able to use in another sweater project, but on the whole I found it to be very derivative of what Fassett was doing 10 years ago without adding much of additional value."
2,Not quite what I expected,"The quality was quite nice and the shape was perfect, but the balance was way off.I didn't realize that the training knife would have a light alloy blade, my others have heavy rubber or drilled steel,and the balance when going through drills wasn't even close to the real knife...which I purchased at the same time.The grip and sheath are identical to the non-trainer, except in blue, and you can see the quality of the workmanship.I returned the trainer and was very pleased with Amazon's prompt response to my concerns, arranging to have UPS pickup the package and credit to my CC"
3,Super Reader,"Indy has a father that is still alive, and he is the block for the old chip, so to speak. He does wear hats that haven't been beaten to hell, however. With his dad, Jones must first uncover and make sure that the Holy Grail does not fall into the wrong hands. To do that, though, a whole lot of surviving and dealing with devious females and relatives must be done."
4,Henry Jone's Last Crusade,"The novelization of the third Indiana Jones series film starring Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is as exciting as the movie itself. What makes this story interesting is the presence of Henry Jones, the bookworm father of Indiana Jones, who is a well-known archaeologist. Last Crusade returns a bit to the first one portraying Indy as a professor. Just as the first of the series Nazi was the archenemy of the Jones' party and the treasure they are after is again biblical. Logic and illogic coexist. But that's okay. Indiana Jones came from the comic hero long long time back.If you love the movie, I am sure you will enjoy the book too including some of the parts movie left out. It is really like playing PC roll playing game while I am reading this book.Recommended for Indiana Jones series fans."
5,Wilderness Adventure,"The book I read was very good because it teaches you about horses, and how to take care of them. It's an age appropriate book, and I think other 12 yr. olds interested in horses would enjoy it. The characters in the book are on a pack trip in the mountians. This book also has a moral, which is never try to do a book report, and be in the wilderness at the same time."
4,quite dirty and fun to read,this book reads like a diary... so that makes it kinda hot. its about the sex life of a school girl.. she learns to do many dirty thigs.. all in all it was fun to read.. but i wish it had been in color! lol
3,"i like peanut butter, but after this not as much.","The story of Molly and Erica in ""The Diary of Molly Fredrickson: Peanut Butter Vol. 1"" was very interesting. I would say the story was good and kept me reading. The coloring was very artistic and was well drawn. It didn't take too long to read and it was worth the money I paid for it. Now what I found to be a bit bad about this book was some space were super and realist fine well other turn a little cartoony at times, I guess trying to put some humor in the story. Some of what you have to read is put in to large spaces and takes away from the story. But other than that the book is good and is worth it for me. I even shown it to my girlfriend and she found it to be a good read as well. If you like horny school girls and a okay story I go with this. If school girls isn't what you like then I buy something else."
4,Diary of Molly Fredrickson:Peanut Butter.,"Good book i wish it was in color but,that is okay because it still enjoy it."
3,Not among the best adult comics I've read,"The artwork is very stylized, and I really don't care for the look of the characters. All of the art is full-color. The book details the sexual adventures of a high school senior and her slutty friends. There is a lot of interracial sex. While this volume is not bad, I will not be buying the others in this series. There is an innocence I like to see in adult comic characters, and it is lacking here. The characters may be 18 years old, but they act like jaded adults."
1,God Awful,"Don't waste your money on this junk. The art stinks, and the story is boring and way too much text to read."
3,Encyclopedia of Women's Autobiorgraphy,The Encyclopedia is alright. I expected more in information. Some information I found was not valid after researching further scholarly resources on the person I was investigating. Pretty pricey for what I received.
1,Good luck playing it!!,"This game works maybe the first couple of times you play it with acceptable passcodes, then it crashes every time you play it! And good luck getting help from Lucasarts.com--I sent in a request for technical support five days ago and have yet to hear from them!"
4,"Techincal improvments, gameplay goes down.","This game is like rogue squaderon 3d, but with improved graphics, music, sound, and the rest of the techinical improvments.Just system requirments request more.But what this game's lack of gameplay is what distrubes me.I dont reccomend it to any star wars gamer.this simulation is not worth it.The only reason why I gave it 4 stars becaue of techinical improvments.thats it.:("
3,Not what picture depicts,The straps are solid black in color. Picture on Web shows black with red stripe.I purchased them in part to help identify my luggade.Black on black is of little help.
3,Bummed out!,"I bought this album hoping to enjoy more of Nora's wonderful voice. I was so shocked when the CD started playing over after three songs! Guess this was partly my mistake because I didn't notice it before I bought the CD, but why shouldn't I have expected at least 8 to 10 cuts. With only 3 cuts, cut the price! Would I send it back because of that, NO, but I do feel deceived."
1,Too expensive for a single!,"Maybe I was a fool for not realizing the ""single"" would consist of only three tracks but as they say fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. In the future I'll stick to bricks & mortar for my CD's because I'll realize immediately that $12.99 for only 3 tracks is not a merchant's mistake but a rip-off."
1,Are You Kidding Me? Just Three Songs?,"I am a very busy person and so do things fast, like purchase books and CDs that I already know I want over Amazon.com: It's easy, fast and efficient. I quickly located the new Nora Jones CD with the song ""Don't Know Why."" I blasted through the web page and ordered the CD along with some others and then forgot about it. I love her voice, style, everything! Even though I didn't read the fine print, I EXPECTED to receive 9 - 11 cuts and maybe 45 - 55 minutes of music for the price I paid. What I received was a disappointment: three cuts and 11 minutes! What a rip! New artists shouldn't allow this to happen. I have a choice as a consumer and there are many talented artists out there that are just as good that will give me my money's worth."
4,Floor puzzle,"This floor puzzle has been loved for 2 years by our now 5 yr old son The case is great but he is rather rough on things and did manage to rip the lid off. An average child would likely not do this, it is quite sturdy. That said, ALL puzzle pieces are still in great condition and he still pulls it out occasionally to put together."
2,ruins your cards.,This card case is OK I was expecting A LOT more its not that heavy its a little cheap and it scuffs up your cards really bad like scratch's the box and ruins the edge's and because of that I rarely use it. Sure it looks cool in the pictures but I should have saved my money and gotten a couple of good decks of cards instead. If you really want a card clip then spend a little more and order a joe porper instead I think that would be the best way to go any questions just feel free to leave a comment.
4,Nicely done for a first time author,"This book was written as though the author himself has had personal experience with a goddess whose beauty and power captivated him... nicely done, Mr. Valenti"
3,Janette Oke book 5,Once again I haven't read it yet. I know I will love it as much as I do the first book.
3,Beyond the Gathering Storm,"I thought since it was the same series, the story would follow #4, it didn't. Almost a completely different story and characters."
5,Awesome story,"This book was great! Reminds you to make sure when you seek guidance from God, that you listen carefully and not let your own wants blind you from seeing His will. Wonderful love story too."
2,Stick with the orginal four.,"I was excited to see that Janette Oke had written two more books for her Canadian West series (my favorite of all her books)about Wynn and Beth's kids, but I was very disappointed after I read them. Either the quality of her writing has diminished or my literary taste has matured, maybe both; either way, these two books were not that great. This book is better than #6 (When Tomorrow Comes), but not much. The development of Henry's character is consistent with what you'd expect from Wynn & Elizabeth's son, but Christine's character in this book is inconsistent with her upbringing and inconsistent from one page to the next. The story is choppy, and you never feel like you're really connecting with the characters. It was lacking in numerous areas. Stick with the original four, and you won't be disappointed."
2,music great of course but the plot is boring,there will never be another mario lanza he was it. but this movie could have been done better the music is great of course his epic performance of nusum dorma from turandot is fantastic and is probably up there with franco corelli and jusi bejorling the other arias he performs are great as well. but as allways with any lanza picture the screenplay falls flat and is down right boring at times. not to metion it can get pretty korny also. so serenade is given 2 stars for its horrible script if you wanna see lanza at his best its here so get a tape and edit the soap opera script and keep the music cause thats all your ganna want to see
4,beat infested tracks that are a joy to dance to.,"This is a great effort by Jordan Knight, much to the cedit of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (of Janet Jackson fame). The vocals are tight and the beats are well...FORGET ABOUT IT! The beats are hot and fast and track 3 is very remminiscent of Chicago House music in its hey day. I love dancing and driving fast to this song!"
4,knight still has bite...,"As a once obsessed fan of NKOTB I knew I would love it just because it's Jordan, but it really is a cool song. I especially like the chorus and the carnival music. I must say, it is definetly a different sound than what we're used to hearing from him. He and Joey are doing pretty good."
5,kicks ass,"this man's a playa and he isn't flauntin' it...he's just sayin': hey, i notice you noticin' me, so i just want to put you on notice; nobody does it better than Jordan Knight."
5,"got me , hook , line , & sinker",the song has a grab u beat that makes u fall in love with the song. i first heard it while shopping and made the store clerk start the tape over so i could find out who it was before i'd even heard the whole song and the re-mixes r some of the best
5,The best beat..............,i love the beat of the song. it is different than any other song i have ever heard i love it.
4,This is great!,I used to love nkotb and Jordan was definitely my favorite. He is a great dancer and singer. I really like him alot!
1,I would give it less than one star if i had the choice to,"Well. First of all, when i was younger i was a huge New Kids on the Block fan! (as every girl my age was back then..) But, well it's the 90's, and as i am sorry to say TIMES HAVE CHANGED, and voice levels have change too. As much as I love to see good looking men shake their asses around and look all pretty, i am going to pass on middle age men, who used to be something, that are now just washed up trash, dance around on mtv..no thank you. anywhoo. please refrain from listening to this song, or this album. I wouldn't have it, if i wasn't given it at a dance. i repeat..do not play this single ever! spend your money on something that is actually good.l8ter"
2,A catchy tone but.....,"You have to listen to it a few times. When I first heard it, it was like, ""oh, that's it?"" For me personally, it was a song that I would not generally pay any attention to. After I first heard it, it got stuck in my head and I found myself humming parts of it. Not to say that I like it, but I'm not saying I don't. The song is just there. It's more like something you have to get use to. He still has a great voice and can still dance, but the song is not the kind that would impact you, or at least it didn't to me, the first time you hear it."
5,"Ilove the song,I wish he could give it to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!",I think Jordan Kinght is soooooo cute and I love the video it's so cool and so is he!!!!!!!!!
1,Don't buy it....,"I don't understand what the point of releasing this maxi single was. What difference in sales would this make? If people didn't like the single in the first place, why would people pay six bucks for five versions of the same horrid song? This guy needs to go back to school and get an IQ before he does anything else. How long's it gonna take him to figure out he's flopped? The process, however excruciating, should be fun to watch."
4,Great uptempo beat and original stlye,"Everyone thought I looked like Jordan knight back when he was a New Kid...I got alot of girls cause of it, Now that he's back and the album looks like it will be great..i'm back in business again."
5,One of 1983's best salsa albums.,"This was undeniably one of the greatest albums of its time. Papo and Ismael came up with areal winner here (most of Sonora Poncena's key musicians are featured and their playing is excellent). It's sad to think there was never a follow-up project to ""Mucho Talento"" and that Ismael retired from recording circa 1985. ""Al Fin Cediste""' ""Vamos/ Hablame Ahora"", ""Quien Dijo"", ""Manias"" and the heartwarming ""Un Valentin"" are more than enough reason to buy this CD."
4,I beg to differ...,"...With most of the reviews. The Dead Talk Back is may favorite of the four, far better than Hobgoblin and Phantom Planet. Because of those two I'm not going to bother with this set unless the price comes way down. I have TDTB and MAGG recorded and the quality is sufficient that I don't yearn for the official copies. Phantom Planet is relentlessly banal and Hobgoblins is just too stupid to deprive any joy from. I don't know why I'm not as bored with TDTB as most people seem to be, it just has a certain incompetent charm that I can appreciate. Monster-A-Go-Go is certainly tedious but the riffing is good enough to make it reasonably fun."
2,Not funny,I was excited to order the next volume of MST3000 for my son and I to enjoy....it was not to be. The funniest portion of the set was the shorts....which are always a guarantee for laughs...the quips at the movies were just not funny.
5,"Funny,funny episodes.....","Glad to see that Phantom Planet,Hobgoblins and Monster A-Go-Go are in this set.The Dead Talk Back is good,too...These are real funny episodes from the Joel era,Mike era and the Sci-Fi era and I hope Rhino Video(who's doing a darn fine job,by the way!)put Hercules and the Captive Women,Hercules,The Day the Earth Froze,Teenage Caveman,Future War,Blood Waters of Dr.Z;just to name a few out on future volumes...How about Season 2 through Season 5 episodes?? Very original,inventive and funny...Wish it was back on the air....Anyway,this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! How about some extras next time??? Great job Rhino!!"
5,clothesline pulley with bearing works well,"clothesline pulley with sealed bearing works well,it seems to help with the drag and weight of a long clothesline of 200'"
4,Great stand alone MIDI gear,"But a pain in the neck to program and as it is MIDI, it was not designed to ""stand alone"". Does anyone know of a cheap sequencer or PAW software to simply string patterns together to make a song or make small variations to existing patterns?"
3,"No AC adapter, though it says there is.","If you read ""What's in the box?"" on the Amazon web page it says that an AC adapter is included. When it arrived there was no AC adapter and it is clear the box is so small that there is no way it could have been included. The AC adapter is for sale separately for $25, which is a lot for an AC adapter and raises the actual price of the thing considerably, if you don't want to keep buying AA batteries all the time. If you sit around your music room playing along, you probably want an AC adapter. This is a Zoom strategy, but Amazon is enabling this by indicating that the AC adapter is included. Only option is to pay $25 for an adapter or send the thing back. So figure that into the price when you buy."
4,"Needs more patterns, but...","Admittedly, I got this because I am no drummer and needed something for backing me in the home studio. So far I've really only played around with this for an hour or two through my head phones but love the sound reproduction. It seems to lack a wide range of patterns, but that may be something I need to look for more deeply in the manual. I have no doubt I'll be updating this review when I get time to sit down and seriously use this, but it's worth the price."
4,Nice machine,This replaced a standard drum machine I had. I like the base lines of the machine (which can be turned off so that you just have drums - if that is what you want).Sounds best to me when I play it through a bass amp.I don't like many of the rhythms in the machine - but there are still enough to satisfy. Good value too.
5,WOW:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):),"This book is great. Nancy goes to Mexico to help a girl find out what a strange message in a crossword cipher means. All Nancy Drew books are great, and I have not read them all, but I am going to. This book deserves more than five stars. The price is great too. I highly encourage you to buy this book!"
3,Some nice tracks,"The first studio recording of Whitesnake. (I consider Northwinds as a solo album of Coverdale). I bought the album in 1978 because of the song Lie Down, a good and simple rock n roll song. Other nice tracks on the album are the title track Trouble, Don't Mess With Me and the instrumental Belgian Tom's Hat Trick. The other songs are o.k. I only dislike the cover version of Day Tripper from the Beatles and the song Free Flight. Trouble is a good album, but has with the exception of Lie Down and maybe Trouble no real highlights. It's interesting for collectors but not a must have."
3,The first of many bites...,"I recently got the original remastered CD album in anticipation, as it was so hard to find; I'd heard many of the tracks in various forms, some studio off the French remastering of Ready An' Willing, some live (off Live In The Heart Of The City) and some off promo CDs (Belgian Tom...); however I was disappointed with all the rest apart from Love To Keep You Warm... the next album was much better, more focused and together, however nothing beats Ready An' Willing! This is a good album for completists however, in no matter what form."
4,Must-Have for San Mateo County Wild Flower Lovers,"Edgewood Natural Preserve is a gem of a wildflower park in San Mateo County, CA, and this book is a key to help you understand what you're seeing there. An excellent guide with clear black-and-white botanical drawings and a terrific common and latin name index. Would be helpful in many wildflower walks in the area."
4,An Overlooked Classic!,"Pauls first two solo albums (""McCartney"", and ""Ram"") are hands down,""Classics"". Along with ""Band On The Run"", these are widely considered ""Essential"" post Beatles recordings. For some reason ""Wings, Wild Life"" was not so well recieved. I believe these songs to be some of Pauls most passionate works. Yes; they may sound rough, and sparsely produced, but these are the qualities that make this such a great release. ""Dear Friend"" alone makes this a must have. A song with a rawness seldom explored by Sir Paul. ""Wild Life""; the title cut, is as intence as any of Pauls screamers. One of my personal favorites is ""Some People Never Know""; here, Linda shows early signs of the wonderful influence she will have on Pauls sound. As much as some people may say they dislike her singing; It seems impossible to imagine Pauls music without her. ""Wings, Wild Life"" is a wonderful look into the humble beginnings of an artist in transition. Not to mention, some great music."
2,three great tracks,"The album as a whole is obviously ungood. But a few tracks deserve to be remembered, and have to be possessed by any pop music fan. 'Wild life' is fun (though I doubt sometimes I would feel the same if English was my native language...), with great vocals; 'Dear friend' is rather touching (I suppose Lennon and McCartney felt obliged to compete with musical quality when recording songs about their relationship, though of course the words are always ridiculous); finally, 'Tomorrow' is one of my McCartney favourite, which would have been a hit any time but in this ungrateful early post-beatles era. By the way, please notice that, for at least the first three or four bars, and regardless of the key, which I didn't check, 'Tomorrow' follows the same chord structure as 'yesterday'... by no means a coincidence, it isn't such a common structure!"
2,Mild life,"A rare misfire. McCartney was inspired by Bob Dylan to make his new record a spontaneous, one-take, semi-improvised affair. Which might have worked for Bob Dylan, but does Paul McCartney -- whose gifts are for rich melodies and catchy hooks, and careful, painstaking craftsmanship -- no favours, particularly when he was fresh out of good new songs. Dear Friend is interesting from the Beatles-fan point of view (it's another open letter to John, replying to recent criticism); and I've always liked the cover of Love Is Strange, where Paul and Linda do a rare duet. The rest is either stick-in-the-mud heavy rock (Wild Life) or throwaways (pretty much everything else). The bonus tracks added to this release do add some much-needed melodic sense to the record. Mary Had A Little Lamb, much reviled on release, now brings a smile to this new father's face. On the whole, there's a lot better Paul McCartney records to go after than this one."
3,low key and low fi,"Many of the positive reviews posted here so far have mentioned how ""fun"" this record is. I would concur--""Mumbo"" really has a good groove, with ""lyrics"" that defy translation, and ""Bip Bop"" is just plain goofy, if you're in that sort of mood. I wouldn't analyze the understandable lyrics too much, either; ""Love is Strange"" is a remake of the Mickey & Sylvia hit, not a description of Paul & Linda's marriage...and ""Wildlife"" really goes over the top--to waltz tempo, Paul screeches something like ""WIIILLLDLIIIFE! WHATEVER HAPPENED TO...WIIILLLDLIIIIFE! ANIMALS IN A ZOO! "" It's long, drawn-out and repetitive, and may have you picking up the needle. The rest of the songs are OK, nothing more--mellow, intimate, somewhat forgettable, but not unlikeable (except ""Wild Life"") Clearly, better things were to come out of this group, in its numerous forms. It's still better than the over-rated ""Venus & Mars"", though."
1,So Bad,"This is by far and away McCartney's worst album. Bip Bop might be the worst song ever written. The ONLY redeeming song is the remake of the old Love is Strange song. Mumbo has a catchy melody, but I have no idea what the words are that Paul is singing.Quite frankly, these songs sound as if McCartney penned them quickly while sitting on the toilet. The quality of the songs is very poor. I do not recommend buying this album, even if you're a Beatles or McCartney fanatic. I wouldn't spend $.50 cents on this album even if I saw it at a yard sale."
1,One star is generous.,"First of all, I am a big McCartney fan. However, no pair of rose colored glasses can make me see this as anything but pure drivel. This is an embarrassing recording from an artist who has written and performed on some of pop music's best records. I am the first to admit that McCartney has made several bad albums, but none so entirely unlistenable.There is one good thing about the CD though: it includes the B-side ""Oh Woman Oh Why"" which is a good track."
3,It's good stuff,"I bought this album after reading the reviews posted here. I have almost all of Paul's albums, but this was one of the few I waited a long time to get because I heard it wasn't so great. Of course, it is no ""Flaming Pie"" or ""Band On The Run"", but it is definitely an interesting album, and I think it worth getting for any Paul/Beatles fan. It fits in well with ""McCartney"" and ""Ram""."
3,Odd but not bad,"This rough, quirky album was made in about two weeks in order to get a band together. It is a series of simple songs made memorable by the fun and enthusiasm of the venture. Few songs stand out much on their own, though the band turns in a good cover of ""Love is Strange"" and a nice melody with ""Tomorrow."" The CD is improved by the addition of one of McCartney's greatest B-sides, ""Oh Woman Oh Why,"" and his classic version of ""May Had a Little Lamb."" This album is a listenable experiment."
3,at a second glance...,"We all know how this album was torched when it first came out. The critics had a field day, but you know what? This is a good Wings album with some really good songs and great playing. I remember the album holes and the two sided Paul and Linda photos. I thought that was really cool!!Just listen to Paul's bass playing on ""Mumbo"" and the raw vocal on the title track. ""Dear Friend"" his reply to Lennon ,and ""Tomorrow"" are wonderful songs. I've always liked ""Bip Bop"". This album along with his first two: ""Mccartney"" and ""Ram"" have that original sound. This changed right after that. Paul's raw vocals pretty much left into ""Red Rose"" and ""Band"". It then became pure polished pop. After watching ""Wingspan"",these records really need a second listen too. They will show you how good and under-rated they really were at the time."
3,Mumbo,"Although this is indeed McCartney's oddest offering, it is not as bad as many critics would have you believe. This album came out just three years after the break up of the Beatles, which as fate would have it was the same result with his new band Wings just before the album was released. His new band mates also seemed to have a bit of a problem with Mr. McCartney's bossy nature. The result was a confusing, yet for the most part enjoyable album. I hate to admit it but Mary Had a Little Lamb, which was added to the CD and obviously written and sung for McCartney's young ones at the time, is really quite good."
4,Sobering read,"King's inspiring story takes you down a dirty and drunken road, one you're glad you're not on with her. But there were moments (too many really) that each of us can relate to, even if finding a drink isn't the first and last thought of the day. Having known many alcoholics I could empathize with her family's sense of helplessness. All in all, a great read."
4,Rivetting and Heartbreak Story,"I really enjoyed this, Heather was very honest and didnt try and gloss over any of the gory details. It was very good read which I found hard to put down."
3,Average story - Good descriptive prose - not much of a plot,"Quick read, she writes well, has very little to talk about. Therefore she has recounted, very well, her own diary, which, as diaries do, had no plot.Million Little Pieces without the story to back it up. And since James Frey made his story up, they are both a 3 star toss up."
4,Brutally honest journey,"I didn't get into this book immediately. It was a slow, simmering process, where in the end I was holed up in bed, tucked under the covers intensely absorbing every word. I often read in the sunshine...out on my porch, in the swing. This time, I found the sunny blue skies interrupting the desperate mood of the book. Reading in bed, late at night, in the quiet dark of the house, I allowed myself to fully feel this journey.I was able to put myself in the bars, in the restaurants, the author's life. One thing I appreciated about the story, was that the author was able to get me there, to let me feel the pain, without the gratuitous details of her sex & drug life.In the end, the author writes of grace: ""I just know that only a God of inexhaustible love, infinite creativity, and a burning desire to count every last one of us in could have taken a broken-down wreck like me and made something useful of her.""Thank you, Heather King, for sharing your story."
2,Not very helpful - in my opinion,"I was not expecting too much about this book, being a pocket book and only mentioning 50 tips on it (as the title states). But, I got less than what I expected! I could only find like two or three tips in the whole book that were interesting, seemingly helpful or ""eyes-opener"". Nothing else.For me, the only good part is that being easily transportable, I could take it to read at the metro, bus, plane, etc. But again, I do not know many more times I can stand re-reading it."
4,Great Book,"I know very little of what is to be known about being a great bodybuilder, beings I have only competed in two bodybuilding competitions. I have read Arnold's Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding, as well as a book by Franco Columbu, both of which are great, just as this one is. I highly suggest anyone of any caliber to read any of these books. Don't just skim the book either, read it! When I read sliced I felt like Bill was talking directly to me, with comments like ""oh I'd look like that too if I ate a lot and lifted that hard"", but we all know the little runts that say that could never do what it takes to be the best."
4,If you Like Math,I had to get this book for college and it worked. I passed so I guess I shouldn't complain.
4,THE RAMAINZ CARRY ON THE RAMONES LEGACY,"The Ramainz, (Marky Ramone, Dee Dee Ramone, and Dee Dee's wife Barbara Zampini) are a much-needed fix for those lamenting the Ramones retirement. ""Live in N.Y.C."" is loud and raw, featuring 19 classic Ramones songs and 2 Ramainz originals. Dee Dee and Barbara share the vocals, and unlike the Ramones, the songs are not played at break-neck speed. It is refreshing to hear these songs at original studio version tempos. This album is definitely a ""must-have"" for Ramones fans."
4,Blast Off!,"Sean Ellis's first published effort is a fast paced, enjoyable ride, which will leave fans of this genre asking for more. In my opinion the story does not start well with a prologue that is a little stretched in a supernatural vein, with events happening to fast to be considered flowing. That said the plot gets back on track in the next few pages evolving to a murder mystery, then to an action adventure mixed with a little science fiction terminating in world destruction! It alls ties together very well at the end which explains the strange beginning (read prologue). Do read this if you like Matthew Reilly or earlier James Rollins stuff, you wont be disappointed."
4,Authentic Recipes,"Because this book is no longer in print, it has become a little pricy, but if you like Luby's dishes and want to try them at home, it's worth it. I really enjoy this cookbook!"
5,Cool cookbook,"If you like Luby's, you will love this book. It has recipes for all the favorites that are available at Luby's. Excellent book."
3,Caution,I was uplifted by this book...reminded that God is in control of every moment of every day...but...my understanding of prayer and some of the author's views do not match and it troubled me because the author didn't take enough time to prove his view with Scripture.
3,Caution and be warned.,I have alot of reservations about this book. Its not one I'd recommend to my weak Christian friends. I would say I am strong in my faith. This book makes you question many things that you have believed. I am not saying its true or that I believe it all but it certainly makes you think. Parts of the book makes you feel good like a motivational speaker would. But others make you wonder whast the point in what I say or do. I don't know. Read all reviews carefully. I got it from the library. I wont be purchasing it.
4,Tough Guy Gary Cooper Tamed By French Belle In An Early Western Talkie,"In an early Gary Cooper ""talkie"" from 1931,the Coop is quite a cad in ""The Fighting Caravans"". In order to avoid jail time for a misdemeanor in town, he pretends to be married to a French belle, and hooks up with a wagon train headed West. Sparks fly between the two, but he's a tough scout and not one to be shackled to no woman! Slowly he begins to warm to her, but first must save the Wagons from an Indian attack. It's really nice and quite a treat to watch the wonderful facial expresiions of many of the actors who came from the silent era.This film is also included in theGreat American Western V.16, Thewith 3 other great films that have the tough guys and women theme. Included on that volume is ""The Woman Of Town"" (1944) with Claire Trevor ,a fabulous recently made documentary ""Old West Cowboys"", and , ""The Proud and the Damned"" with Chuck Conners - see my review of this DVD for film and dvd details.Happy Trails....Laurie"
3,Useful but misleading,"The issues Gore (his ghost-writer) raises are legitimate. In fact there is an environmental crisis. Gore's contribution is to inject these contentious questions into a largely disbelieving mainstream. The trouble is that the rhetoric from this politician is sappy and banal. Moreover - as could be expected - he dodges the main issue underlying environmental crisis. Namely, how can we expect an economy based on commodities, accumulation, and an aggressive exploitation of our natural environment to solve the problem that it has largely created. No mention is made of this underlying paradox. To do so, however, would end Gore's political career, a sacrifice that neither he nor the two-party monopoly he represents are prepared to make. Readers would be better advised to step up to the many better books on this urgent topic."
4,evironmental book,"former VP discusses environmental state of earth and mankind hs the responsibility to make wise changes to save the earth. Clean upair, and water recycle and not depend on non renewable resources."
1,"""In The Balance"" Out of balnce",Interesting book from someone who owns large amounts of stock in oil companies. Also the actual book's quality is extremely poor. He appears to have an identity crisis one minute world renouned author the next inventor of the internet.
1,"Mr. Gore, what would we do without you?",Writing a book that promotes environmentalism on paper is like writing a book that condemns the killing of humans and binding it with human skin!
1,Psychobabble to a fault.,"""To the consumption of the earth itself. This addictive relationship distracts us from the pain of what we have lost: a direct experience of our connection to the vividness, vibrancy and aliveness of the rest of the natural world."" This from the least outdoorsy person on the scene today. If he says he stands by every word in his book, I believe you have a man out of balance, yet he says I am dysfunctional. Al Gore is scary."
1,Chicken-Little,"I picked this book up because I was curious. I read it from cover to cover. I then went to the Internet and researched all of his predictions. The United Nation's own Global Warming website completely contradicts his prediction of atmospheric C02 and methane concentrations for the ten years following the publication date of his book.He completely misses the mark on transpiration and cellular-respiration and the role plants take part in both of these cycles.He also has a very serious lack of knowledge in basic organic chemistry. He attributes many increases in global warming gasses (mainly C02 and methane) to man, but fails to mention that these gasses are a natural product of carbon-based life-cycle (from: birth --> death --> break-down into molecular components). In fact all herbivores generate thousands of pounds of methane a year. Does anyone remember the millions of bison that used to exist in the Midwest?"
1,courageous and on the mark,">He attributes many increases in global warming gasses (mainly C02 and methane) to man, but fails to mention that these gasses are a natural product of carbon-based life-cycle (from: birth --> death --> break-down into molecular components). In fact all herbivores generate thousands of pounds of methane a year.Look up the word ""increases"" in a dictionary, bonehead."
4,WSU Professor uses EIB as text in Env. Ethics course,"Al Gore is a politician, not a professional philosopher. Given that, it is a very thoughtful and well-researched essay.Imnportant themes in EIB are: 1. We need to develop a geological long-term perspective to clearly evaluate environmental issues. 2. There is an immanent threat of global warming, and we need to drastically reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. One solution is to reduce our dependence on automobile transportation. 3. Our destruction of the environment is a symptom of a deeper ""psychic pain"" and spiritual void that we try to fill through excessive consumption."
5,Reading it objectively....a great book! Buy 10 copies,"One must conclude that this is one of the best thought out books ever written on the enviroment and the human condition. Many of it's critics here seem to be more motivated by political hatred of Gore than by anything else......I suspect by there comments and assessment of the book that they have not read it, and if they have...well... that just goes to prove once again that we need more teachers in the classroom. A must read."
1,Junk science mixed with leftist politics,"Having majored in both chemistry and math as an undergrad, some ofGore's wild statements in this book jumped off the page at me - andmade me wonder if Gore ever took a course in either chemistry orphysics long before the Washington Post printed just how low hiscollege grades in science were at a time when professors rampantlyinflated grades to keep kids out of the Vietnam draft.Running theAL GORE IN HIS OWN WORDS resource library in Alamance Independent..., it's obvious to me that Gore's current""embellishment"" (lying) problem long predates his currentcampaign - like at least to when this book was written in 1992.Butif you are a conservative, definitely buy this book - and heat up yourlocal talk shows daily until Election Day with not only its outrightjunk-science lies, but also with its scary implications formiddle-class jobs and lifestyles."
3,It has it's good points,"I really wanted to like this book. I tried hard to sit and read it cover to cover. It's got a lot of great insight, but isn't exactly riveting. I admire Mr. Gore for coming out and taking the stand that he has. He's tried to take some complicated scientific ideas and make them palatable to the average joe. Those in the industry might find it a bit simplistic.I like that he's putting a human face on environmental issues and taking the moral high road in this book. The chapter on Environmentalism and the Human Spirit does a great job of presenting green values as Christian values."
1,Disappointing,"I have followed Gore for about 20 years -- well before he became popular. He was active in the technology areas before and while he was in Congress, much less so when he was chosen as VP (no, he did not invent the Internet). Having an idea of what to expect, I was disappointed in that the author used disreputable or questionable sources and stuck more to a ""preaching"" mantra than trying to ""discover"" the truth."
5,Gore is right on,"This is a very informative book. If you don't know that much about the environment and issues such as Global Warming and polution you should definitely read this. It is a long read but filled with information. Gore has also included an extensive list of resources that he used in the bibliography. He also has notes where he explains where he got his information chapter by chapter. I learned so much, and after reading this book I don't see how it is possible to not take the Environment seriously."
3,An OK read...,"So this book was written in 1990...things have changed a lot since then - some for better some for worse. So keep that in mind while reading this book. But some good facts in the book though from extensive research. That is the selling point for this. However, I think the presentation and writing style made it a little difficult to maintain focus. I might have felt differently had I read this in 1990."
4,A Refreshing Book,"I read ""Earth in the Balance"" years ago when Vice-PresidentGore was first elected. Though the environment is not an issue I feelpassionately about, I was impressed by the depth of Gore'sknowledge. This is not the usual blah blah book about ""How Iwould change America"" assembled by the Senator's staff on the eveof an important election. This is a very passionate, very detailedanalysis of an issue Al Gore has spent years on. Regardless of how youfeel about Gore's environmental views (the reviewer is unimpressed bythe author's viewpoint on the issue of urban sprawl), you have to givethe Vice-President credit for making a detailed argument about anarcane subject most politicans don't even pretend to understand. ..."
1,pseudo science babble,The book is pseudo science babble. Al Gore's claim that 3 percent rise of temperature will destroy the planet earth has no basis. A rise of temperature of 3 percent is just natural and not dangerous to the planet earth.
1,deplorable journalism and boring as a book can be,"I cannot recall more than a handful of books I have purchased, attempted to read, and never finished.This deplorable show of journalism is is near the top of that ""handful."" It doesn't get much worse than this. I managed to make it to page 75.The facts and theories are smothered by horrid writing.Al Gore should have employed an author to present his ideas and facts."
1,Alarmist fiction with zero scientific credibility,"Like his fellow alarmists such as Ehrlich, Gore emplys a great deal of demagoguery and scare-tactics, with an almost negligible amount of credible scientific evidence to back it. If you've read this book or are planning to read it it, you should also read ""Eco-Scam"" by Ronald Bailey to get a more accurate picture of the issue."
1,"Julian Simon ""said it all"" about this SILLINESS..","The late Julian L. Simon who decimated (and won a bet) withPaul Ehrlich summed up Mr. Gore's effort quite nicely: ""The bookis as ignorant a collection of cliches as anything ever published on the subject."" And, ""Just about every assertionin the book points in the wrong direction - suggesting thatconditions are getting worse rather than better, which they are."" Mr. Simon then discusses the following subjects on whichMr. Gore was WRONG: soil erosion; hardwood trees; DDT; Agent Orange; Love Canal. Finally, Mr. Simon states: ""And the entire book is filled with this sort of environmental gossip, backedby no sources, and contradicted by solid data.""These quotes are from Mr. Simon's ""Hoodwinking the Nation"" whichhas some excellent chapters on ""media shaped opinion"" andthe mis-use of statistics, sampling techniques and data which every citizen should read."
1,Don't run for the hills yet.,"These kinds of books are getting alot of attention because of their doom and gloom appeal. If you take a sceptical look at this book and test the theories and statements he makes you will find that they do not stand up to actual scientific, and factual evidence. Just another attempt to push anti-capitalism propaganda. But what else can you expect from Al Gore."
2,Good book--sub-standard performance.,"This book should be required reading for every American as long as Al Gore has a shot at the whitehouse. Regardless of your political persuasion or your opinion of Mr. Gore, you need to know what this book says. However, don't listen to the tape. The melodramatic reading belittles the importance of what is being said."
2,Entertaining,Al Gore's book book should appeal to those who feel the need to introduce more controls on our lives and who think we actually have any significant control on the earth's environment. Filled with unfounded ideas and strange references to spirits living in all things. How many spirits were snuffed out to print the pages of this tribute to Gore's feelings? Not for thinkers except for it's insight into a those who think of humans as less than dirt.
1,Important Subjects; Very Poorly Written,"Without a doubt, the subjects of the book are important and must be addressed. However, it is almost impossible to actually read the book. In my opinion, I haven't come across a book this poorly written in a long, long time..."
2,"Stale "" pearls""","I had ordered jasmine tea"" pearls before and ,though expensive,the flavor was excellent.Thiis time the "" pearls"" came in a small package,they were crammed together,they were dry and smelled stale and sour.There was no sense to send them back to China,since the shipping is very expensive.I threw them away.At this point I am not sure what seller is worth of my trust.I will try to deal with the USA sellers of this product if I find them."
1,no flavor,"god dam it, it just so plain, hardly any taste, no matter how many bud you put in 1 cup, i put like 20-30 of those tea bud in, it just take a lot of space in the cup , but only able to elicit a fain taste, worst than the restaurant jasmine tea"
3,It's o.k.,It's o.k. Not the smoothest jasmine dragon tea I've had. Has a little sharp after taste. But it's o.k. for everyday.
3,"Wonderful music, but...","The music on this tape is excellent. What it lacks is proper pacing. Although the cassette package says there's a 15 minute warm up, and a cool down at the end, I found it hard to distinguish. It would have benefited from a voice over indicating when the 15, 30, and 45 minute intervals had been reached. I think this is a good tape for a strictly 1 hour walk, but it's not as good for a shorter walk."
2,My least favorite tape,"I walk about 60 minutes a day and listen to music tapes to help me maintain a fast pace. This cassette has NO rhythm, and I have yet to find a way to use it to help me walk at a certain speed. The music is nice, though, so I use it whenever I want to have just a leisurely stroll. I would return this item, if I could."
4,yes bloody satanic baby,you wanna discover evil check out this jams oldheads like myself have been headbanging off this for years just don't bite no bats neck off okay.
5,Bachata Music,"The CD came in a quick time frame. The CD was in great shape. These artist, Monchy Y Alexandra are Bachata singers. The have slow songs to medium move your body music. There music definitely will enchant you and you can dance the night away or just for listening music."
3,It was... a good album,"I bought this album for the second single ""It Was"". This is a magnificently written and beautifuuly sung piece. The charttopping ""Single White Female"" is a great song with a catchy melody and a theme that a lot of women can relate too. The rest of the songs lack the same memorable qualities of these two tracks but overall this album does not disappoint."
5,Became a fan when I heard this song!,"I haven't always been a fan of Chely Wright, actually I really haven't just loved her older stuff, but this song caught my attention and now I can't wait to go buy the CD when it comes out! Everyone has to get the single and CD! Chely is great and the song is unbelievable!"
3,It's decent,This CD didn't really do a whole lot for me. It isn't one single factor that reduced this CD to mediocrity; I think it's a lot of little things combined. Something just doesn't click.
2,Could be better,"This is one of her finer albums, but with this artist that is not saying a great deal. She has better song selection on this album than on previous ones, but her voice is still no comparison to the other ladies of country music."
1,Single White Female is unfortunately the single good song!,"This CD caught my attention with the catchy and fun first hit, ""Single White Female."" Unfortunately that was it. Each song after that lacks heart, beat, or the excitement of the first. I would tell anyone to try but I do regret wasting my time with Chely Wright's second album. It does not compare to the first."
3,All WRIGHT but not great.,"Better song selection like from her ""Let Me In"" album would have made this album as good.The standout songs are the title song Single White Female,It Was,Picket Fences,The Fire.Other than these tracks its SO-SO. buy used"
5,"Chely has a such a beautiful, unique style!","I am very impressed with Chely's latest album, SWF! Every song is terrific! Half the songs are ballads, but they are beautiful, and the uptempo songs rock! My personal favorites are ""It Was,"" ""Some Kind of Something,"" and ""The Fire."" You will not be disappointed in this album. It is full of emotion and each song tells a story. It is really fabulous - I listen to it all the time in the car. It is great cruisin' music! I enjoy it more each time I listen to it. Chely's voice is like a lullaby! I loved this one so much that I went out and bought her previous album (""Let Me In"") and that one is great, too. Buy this CD!"
4,Good CD,"Chely Wright's latest CD ""Single White Female"" has been a big hit for her. It's moved her toward the mainstream country artists such as Faith Hill, Martina McBride, and Shania Twain. The album is good. The best songs are Single White Female, It Was, The Love That We Lost, and The Fire. There aren't any songs on the album that are really bad, but there are a few that I didn't care for. Overall, this CD is a good buy, especially if you like the modern country. It isn't twangy country music, so if you're looking for that, try another artist. But you can definitely tell that Chely's background is in country as you listen to the music and lyrics of the songs on this album. I recommend this CD to any country music fan of today. Way to go, Chely!"
4,It's one of the best bluegrass CD's I've heard lately,The Lonesome River Band is one of the bst bluegrass bands out there if not the best. The first cd of them I bought was ONE STEP FOWARD and I loved it. But FINDING THE WAY is even better.
4,Old but good,"Some of the information in this book may be old, but it is still a worthwhile read. It is interesting to see how attitudes towards gay Jews stood 16 years ago, even if some of the facts aren't true anymore (though they might still hold true--I honestly don't know), and to see what gay Jews did to try to make themselves accepted members of the world community and the Jewish community specifically up until 1989. Also, the rather inspiring personal stories told in this book never expire."
4,Outstanding book specifically for landscaping in New Mexico.,This is probably one of the best books that I have seen so far with regards to pictures and narrative requirements showing which plants are good for planting in New Mexico. Thanks.
2,Best Plants for NM,I feel like i wasted my money on this book. it has not helped me pick plants for where i live and i plan to sell in a garage sale!
4,fun but a little slow,"When I ordered this game I thought that it would be a big action packed adventure RPG, well, you could say that I was wrong.This is more one of those puzzle solving games with about one stars worth of action in it. One thing that I was impressed with though was the dialogue and voice acting in the cut scenes.No this character is not the indiana jones from the movies, but an okay interpretation. The only thing that really made me want to throw this game out was the babylonian accents, they sound like what the president would sound like if he tried to play ghandi.Overall this game is mediocre, but I do have to give it bonus points for the captivating storyline. If you have the patience and an up to date system, then get this one."
2,another lucasarts error ...,The game itself is fairly entertaining but I always seem to get the copies where there is an error on the CD or the disks - it has happened without fail with every Lucasarts game - enough to make me leery about ever buying another Lucasarts game ....
1,Disappointing,"If you're looking at this game because you enjoyed ""Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis"", you'll be disappointed by this one. It's a dressed-up Prince of Persia, lacking the imagination and creativity of ""..Atlantis""."
1,would not run!!!,tryed it one two computers. Would not run. Kept freezing up before the game even started. What a waste. It is proabably good if you get a good disk.
4,Not Bad...,"Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machines was not that bad a game as some people present it. Sure it has older graphics, but the whole idea of pure adventure is still in the game. Compared to some other adventure games, such as the old Tomb Raider games, this game definitely stands to be a good competitor. The plot and action is very much Indiana Jones!"
1,Backward Incompattable,"I have a Dell with a windows xp operating system. My computer does have backward compatible programs but I was only able to play the first level (after much installing, uninstalling, installing, swearing...) so unless you have an old windows 95, 98 PC lying around just say no."
4,O.K Suspense but a Little Mystery,"When I first read this book I recommended this book for 3rd graders . The sentences were almost giving out the whole book ,but still it was o.k for a 6th grade . Even though it says a Mystery book, it would be a mystery for 5th and 4th graders. Then I thought about the book and recommened it for 4th graders because this book is o.k ."
5,What a story!!!!!!,"This story by John Bellairs has a suspensing and mysterious plot. Johhny Dixon's persistence and determination won him 10,000 dollars. Although he is smart enough to figure out Mr. Glomus's riddle and will, he would also have to escape from a mummy to get the will. I would recommend this book to everyone because this story could inspire many people to go out on their own and have their own adventures. Although he wanted to find the will for the 10,000 dollars, he wanted it to save his grandma. This shows that he is not greedy."
1,Where is my item?,Tribute to the Cathedral QuartetWhere is my item. Who dropped the ball on the 26th and 27th. It was supposed to arrive today 29th.I'm very dissatisfied
5,Great,"Alegres, super afinados e harmonicos.Ao assistir o dvd o tempo passa sem que se possa perceber.Recomendo esse como todos os outros deles."
5,Glen Payne and George Younce would be proud,George and Glen must be looking down and grinning at these fellows. It was a wonderful performance. It was fun to just watch and listen.
5,An Indispensable Hinduism Dictionary,"Classic Hinduism, is a difficult subject, especially for those who did not grow up in a Hindu culture. Here is a desk dictionary with the vast scope of covering Hindu mythology, folklore, philosophy, and history. There are about 2500 subject headings on the gods and goddesses, rites, practices, places, literary texts, music, symbols and more, explained in detail and yet understandable for the lay person. There is a 15 page bibliography at the end of the book, and an `English Subjects and Their Sanskrit Equivalents' section. Excellent reference work for students, professionals, and anyone interested."
5,Great quality knife for a very reasonable price!,"I bought 10 of these knives for the purpose of using them as groomsman gifts at my wedding. I wanted to get them something nice that would not break my budget, but that they could use and would last.I have always bought Gerber knives and have always been impressed with their quality. I believe these knives rival those made by expensive brands such as Columbia River and SOG. I have used it as a screw driver (yes, horrible for a knife I know) as well as to cut very durable materials such as zip ties and rope and have never had a blade break on me. I would definitely recommend these knives to anyone looking for a good cheap yet durable tool."
5,Gerber Knife,This Gerber Knife is better than I expected it to be. It's very sturdy and is extremely useful! I use it daily!
4,Everyday carry for years,"This knife has been one of my EDCs for years. I abuse my knifes and this has held up great, I like that the handle is metal, it's tough in prying applications. It's one of my few EDCs that doesn't have a chipped tip. Good knife, a little tough to sharpen and doesn't hold an edge especially long, but still decent."
2,Not up to snuff,"I have owned 2 paraframes and I much prefer my kershaw or buck 286. For a heavy knife, you don't get much in return. The blade is not solid in the handle, opening and closing is not fluid and the pocket clip is very difficult to use. The blade itself is quite good, but the rest is not. Look at a kershaw storm for a better knife or a buck 286 for lighter, cheaper and better.As for my Gerber, it will go in my toolbox or car - not in my pocket."
1,Gerber knife BROKE after 1 mo,Knife broke after 1 mo.. blade stop safety broke off..after light use... getting the runaround from gerber re warantee. only auto emails!!!
1,bad engineering,"To me the basic premise of a pocket clip knife is the ability to remove it from your pocket, uses it and reinstall it on your pocket with one hand. A knife you can do this with becomes an invaluable tool- you don't even realize how much you use it until you leave it home one day and it feels like you left home without your wallet. Unfortunately this knife fails on all counts. I thought I would give it a try for the price but you get what you pay for. It is not easy to open with one hand and near impossible to put back on your pocket with one hand.The clip pushes the material into one of the holes in the side of the knife, you have to stretch your pocket with the other hand to re clip it.ridiculous. Buy a Kershaw leek, you'll pay twice as much but have a useful tool."
5,Love it!,"This is a really great knife and I am pretty picky. Yes it was a little stiff at first, but loosened up after a bit. It looks cool and is very sharp. I just love holding it in my hand. It is a nice chunk of metal. I have the small version which I keep at the office. I always play with it during meetings. Just feels good. Is a tad hard to use the clip, but not really that big of a deal. For the price this is a super knife."
4,Good knife,"This knife was a gift to my teenager who is really into blades. He seems more than happy with it. Despite being a Paraframe, it is sturdy and the blade opens cleanly. It's not a blade that I would prefer, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone else."
5,What you'd expect from Gerber @ $20.00,"If you need a good pocket knife, look no further. Gerber is a time-tested, proven brand that never fails to deliver a satisfactory product. For the ""around $20"" price tag, you can't ask for much more. I'm very happy with my purchase! The only complaint is its inability to hold an edge for very long. It's the grade of the steel, though. I would buy a $200.00 Kershaw if I wanted an edge to last forever."
5,Sharp like always,"I had this knife about 5 years ago and i lost it while hiking.Now, i decided i need another one so i bought one.This is my BEST knife i own and it is large enough to feel like it gets stuff done but compact enough to not be added weight."
2,Total piece of crap,"The action is horrible on this. Takes two hands just to close it. Definitely doesn't live up to the Gerber name.But, for a buck cheaper I bought this one and I love it!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IVHQ5Q/ref=oh_o04_s00_i00_detailsIt's a Kershaw with amazing action and you can't beat it for the price"
3,Great blade. Terrible set up.,This is an update. The blade has loosened up just a bit so that opening and closing is easier. I think this might lead loose bolts on the frame but it's better than it was after the first couple days. I bent the clip slightly so it's easier to fit on over the lip on my pants pockets. So now I can use the knife with one hand. Over all I wouldn't recommend this knife. If I had it to do over I would go with a Kershaw. [...] The blade is great. The clip is terrible as others have noted. You cannot use this knife with one hand. You can get it out with one hand. Opening with one hand can be done but it's not easy. Closing with one hand is easy enough. Replacing to pocket with clip with one hand is impossible.
5,Great Knife!,Very light weight and I think it's a fantastic tool. Sharpens easy and it's nice to carry around because it's not bulky.
5,Fantastic knife,"This knife has been my goto for years. I absolutely love it, it's got a beautiful design with the handle being mostly open. It's a strong blade that stays sharp for a very long time!"
5,Good Stuff,"This knife was given as a gift to me, I don't need the heaviest duty of knives. The knife feels balanced and solid in my hand. I particularly like the low profile the knife keeps in my pocket. I didn't want something bulging out of my pocket and if it weren't for the clip sticking out of my pocket I don't think anyone would be able to tell. As to the complaints of other people that it is hard to pull out, open, close and re-insert into the pocket; I do not struggle with those issues. I am told i have nimble fingers though. I like the knife and has come in handy for me."
2,"Short life, but still pays off","According to Consumer Reports (May 2008), there is a good chance that these bulbs won't even last one-half of their advertised life span (which is advertised to be 8,000 hours). Consumer Reports states that the energy savings may nonetheless leave you better off than an incandescent bulb."
5,Awesome!,I shopped around for more than a year for a toaster and I'm very happy with this one. It looks great and doesn't feel cheap like most others I've looked at. Has a defrost button for frozen waffles. Also has a bagle button too that toasts only one side of your bagle... love that!
1,CRAP - stay away,"Worked OK for a few months, steadily downgraded, and now it's been a year, and I'm tossing it in the can.Totally uneven toasting -- like one half undone and the other half scorched. I've tried flipping the bread at the halfway point (that's convenient!), but even that doesn't help.It's obvious from the reviews here that you MIGHT get a decent toaster, or you MIGHT get junk.I'm certainly not rolling the dice again, I'll go with a reputable company this time."
5,Toasts bread evenly!,"I've never really thought of toasters as good or bad ones, as long as my bread comes out toasty I was fine... until I used this toaster...this toaster FULLY toasts the bread evenly, is stainless steel so it won't morph from heat and has buttons for if you're toasting anything frozen, a bagel, and even a cancel button."
4,"Very Nice Appearance, Well buit, Heats fast.","Toasting is even and fast. The toaster wider than most. The ventilation slots in the sides keep it cool. The crumb tray slides out for easy cleaning The cancel button is a nice feature, better than having to jiggle the lever to stop the toaster. The bagel setting toasts just one side, great for bagels and English muffins. The defrost setting work great. The dial allows a wide range of settings."
1,Broke after 45 days; Return is $14.99,"I purchased this item on January 6, 2009. It looked a little flimsey but I liked that it had a stainless steel finish. I didn't use the toaster very much--maybe ten times in the 45 day period before the lever would not stay down. When I called the company to see about the warranty, which is one year, they told me that they would replace the product for $14.99 shipping and handling expense. That's more than 50% of the cost of the toaster. I'm debating whether to return it because it's not built solidly and I might have the same problem again."
2,"Great Design, Too Much Time","I love the vintage industrial design, but even with the setting on high, it takes forever and still needs to be toasted twice.Great if you are not in a hurry, but I have gone back to my superior 1952 GE."
3,could be worse,"First thing first, the price seems good until you find that you can buy it in Sears outlet for $12 and no shipping. Second, it is made in China, by people deeply uninterested in what they do. Third, it is way better than anything you can buy in Macys, Target, Walmart, Sears etc. - a paradox of our times. It is stainless steel, so no danger of lead poisoning from the Chinese paint; it toasts bread reasonably well and even; the slots are kinda short-ish, but can be made to work. When the toaster pops up, the bread is often stuck midway, and hard to extract without some tool. The next best thing is hand made in England and costs over $300, so this stays."
5,Love it.,I purchased this toaster a month ago and I love it. I have toasted both thin and thick bread and it works well. The retro style looks nice in my kitchen
1,Doesn't toast,"It doesn't toast. Kind of a big problem for a toaster. Toast, muffins, bagels, everything comes out uneven with large areas totally untouched by any heat at all. Is there a good toaster in the world? I have not found it yet."
2,Hope yours does better,"Purchased this on the basis of overall favorable reviews. Its lever latch gave up after ten months of light use, and there is no visible reason for it.A day after I wrote the review, the latch resumed working. Eerie. Well, at least a replacement toaster is on hold. Or not. This toaster is bulky and unloved by the rest of the household."
2,Received Previously Used Item,"I recently ordered the Haier toaster and expected it to be brand new. However, when it arrived there was definite evidence to the contrary, including the packaging was re-taped already on both ends, the cord to the toaster was unraveled, the box was beaten up and the plastic cover looked and smelled all but new. I contacted them via amazon and received a quick reply telling me that they were sorry and that I could send the toaster back and receive a full refund including shipping costs. I did as instructed but did not receive a refund for the costs it took to ship the toaster back to them. I was very much looking forward to this purchase and was very disappointed at the results. I have purchased new kitchen/electronic items online before, and new means new. It means I am the first person to open it, otherwise it's not new."
3,Haier TST85ODS Toaster,"I am somewhat disappointed with this toaster, as it ""toasts"" one side of the bread MUCH more than the other."
4,"Great toaster, but be aware it has short slots","Love this toaster, it toastes the bread uniformly on both sides and color adjusts nicely. My only complaint is that rye bread (Oroweat) center of the loaf slices do not fit lengthwise. So until I find some smaller rye bread, I guess I'll have one little strip that doesn't toast since I have to leave it stick out do to the short slots. Otherwise, it's great."
3,terrible for waffles,"My main use for a toaster is to cook eggo waffles for breakfast. I do that maybe a couple times a week, and I've been using this toaster for several months now. To be honsest, I'm pretty frustrated with the toaster. My old toaster (before it broke down) used to do a really good job of this, but not this one. The trouble is that even at its darkest setting, and using the ""frozen"" option, it doesn't cook it long enough. It needs about 1 1/2 cycles to cook, which usually means I end up eating undercooked, or overcooked. GRRRRR. I'll be looking for a new toaster soon I guess."
1,Haier toaster a bust,"Yesterday I received my Haier two slice toaster. Today the toaster is back in the mail to Amazon. The toaster would not toast both sides of bread. The outside coils on both sides of the toaster would not heat. The only way to toast bread was to run 2 cycles, turning the bread after the first cycle. I can't believe that Haier doesn't check to see if coils are heating before shipping from the factory. However, Amazon's return policy is good and those with a computer, internet and printer can print a prepaid mailing label. I should not lose any money on the toaster or return postage. Return instructions are easy to follow. Just the headache of repackaging the toaster and taking it to the post office."
3,Solid but not the best,"This is a solid toaster, built with a stainless steel shell. I'm disappointed, however, that it toasts bread slowly, which tends to dry the bread out by the time the piece is toasted. I like my toast moist on the inside, toasted on the out."
3,"Beautiful, but not perfect","The styling on this product is very good; however, I was disappointed that it takes so long to toast bread. It also does not have a ""lift"" feature to lift the toast higher after toasting."
4,Nice item,"I purchased this item because of the reviews. I to owned and old Sunbeam and never though I would find another toaster that was as good. It's a shame that someone doesn't make one of the same quality, but I have to say that this seems to be a nice toaster.I was really ticked off when the next week after purchasing this item the price went down 10 bucks. I even thought about sending it back just because. Well I still have it and am pleased in spite of the price.Nice toaster!"
2,What a let down for that price!,"The reason I gave this toaster such a low rating is because while it is an OK toaster, it isn't worth the money. First of all, the sides of the toaster are not die cast-- they are some kind of plastic. Only the center part of the toaster is metal.Second, the heat settings are way off. The toast has seven settings, but above level 4, it burns the toast black. Even on level 3 (where I keep it set most of the time) the corners of the bread get burned.Finally, when I wrote to the manufacturer with a question about operating the toaster, they failed to respond.We were hoping to get something of better quality by paying a higher price, but we would have been better served by the $8 Walmart toaster."
4,nice toaster,"This is one of the nicest toasters we've ever had. It looks great and works even better. Toast is done evenly and the settings are perfect. The bagel feature is cool and works for more than just bagels. On top of it all, the price was less than most other lesser toasters. All in all, a great deal and find."
5,Great little toaster,"I have had this toaster for over a month, and I would like to thank all those people who recommended this toaster, in their reviews. I love this little machine.By far this is my favorite toaster of all time. Why pay more, when you can't get better than this."
1,Looks Good - Doesn't Work,"I purchased this in November. The first one was defective. Amazon replaced it, no problem. In April, it just quit working, not that it toasted all that well to begin with. The dial worked to keep it from burning, but nice even toasting never occurred. Then it suddenly just quit working. Haier stands by their warranty, however it costs $14.99 in shipping to get it replaced. If I'd known that, I'd have spent the extra up front and gotten a better one."
1,Broken in less than a month,"I have had this toaster for less than a month. Already, the toaster handle will not stay latched down. Given another reviewer's experience with Haier's prohibitively-high shipping fees to invoke the warranty, this purchase appears to be a total loss.While it was working, it did fine, although the slots are a bit short for longer bread slices."
3,Toaster,"Nice looking toaster,but it leaves a portion of the bread untoasted. The bread has to be turned over to get an even toast using a lighter toast cycle."
4,simple: great toaster,"We gave up our toaster oven and were looking for a stainless toaster with simple controls and easy to clean/keep clean. This Haier has delivered.The toast shade selector takes a little experimentation and varies, for us, depending on whether we're toasting bread or a bagel.The simple design keeps crumbs from getting stuck where they shouldn't be and the crumb tray is easy to get out, clean, and replace.One drawback: smaller items don't come out of the slot enough to grab with fingers w/o burning them, so we have to use little bamboo grabbers."
4,Haier 2 slice/wide slot toaster,At first we were not impressed because we did buy a lower priced toaster after all.After toasting quite a few bagels in this Haier I have to change and admit it does a fine job.I would replace it with the same model immediately if this one goes on the fritz.
2,Disappointed with results,"This toaster does not toast evenly on both sides of the bread, and tends to dry out the bread. The one side that does brown seems to have a centered brown area and no toasting on the outer edges. Too late to return it, so I'll donate it and order a Breville Ikon."
4,Love my toaster!,"Great toaster - cooks perfectly, easy to control settings, takes up little space, easy to clean out crumbs and looks awesome with our other stainless steel appliances!"
4,Haier's Happy Toaster,"A top quality toaster with great looks usually costs three times as much. Haier has produced the TST850DS to fill the niche for high quality at entry level pricing. The stainless steel is uniform with a solid feel and controls all function perfectly in a 'retro' style that offers unfussy operation. Durability? We'll see, but 'out of the box' performance? An excellent product that is far nicer to have on the counter than the cheapie white plastic ones that are commonly available. Service and delivery? We are still blown away with our experience. WE read a review on a Sunday, ordered on Monday had the toaster on Wednesday. No driving, no shopping, no bother with disinterested shop employees. Thanks Haier and thanks Amazon for a supplier who delivers quality goods quickly, cleanly and with impressive responsiveness."
4,2 slice toaster,"This toaster does a great job on toast and English muffins. It allows you to warm English muffins without over crisping the outer muffin if that's what you want. One thing I love is that you can toast hamburger buns.Things I don't like: The special feature buttons on the front, have writing that's hard to read for old eyes. The top of the toaster can get very hot.One good feature is that the lever won't stay down if you forget to plug it in, which with my old toaster, I might lower the lever and walk away not realizing that it's not plugged in."
1,Senior Housewife,"Purchased on the recomendation of Consumer Report. The lever would not hold the carriage down, called the supplier and was told to cut off eight inches of the numbered cord and send to them and throw the toaster away,which I did. I was told a new toaster would be sent, after five weeks it has not arrived."
4,"Great toaster, I use it everyday for toast, Eggos etc. Love it !","We got this about 1 week ago, I use it every day for toast and Eggos.When you 1st get it make sure to put it on highest setting and let the oil / chemical smell burn off at least 3-4 cycles w/out toast...Once it's clear of the chemical smell your good to go for toasting!It does a good job and sides are not HOT - safer & better.The center where toast goes is S.Steel but the 2 sides are metal. I tested w/a magnet it won't attract to S.Steel. Over all a solid 4 stars.We paid $25.00 w/free s/h got it in 2 days!! Now on sale today."
2,Discontinued model by Haier....mine was defective,I bought this toaster on Amazon. I loved the style and it seemed like a solid built toaster. First time I used it it smelled like burning wiring. I tried it a second time and the same thing. The smell lingered in my kitchen for half an hour or so. I called Haier and they told me that was not normal and could be dangerous. I immediately returned it to Amazon and asked for replacement but was told they do not have any more. Today a safety person from Haier called me to ask a lot of questions about this toaster and the issues...he told me this model has been discontinued....buy at your own risk....there is a reason it was discontinued...now the market is flooded with them at really low prices compared to the original price. Maybe the problem I had was prevalent.
1,Uneven toasting,"I bought this toaster based on the positive reviews I read at the amazon.com site. I wanted something to replace my old toaster-oven, which browns unevenly. Unfortunately this toaster didn't solve the problem. With one slice of toast, the outer side of the toast was too pale if the inner side was browned correctly; if the outer side was toasted correctly, the inner side was almost burned. After a week of fiddling with the settings, I returned the toaster and will look for another brand. Maybe I just got a ""bad appple"" but I am not inclined to buy another Haier...."
4,pretty good,I like that it toasts bread and english muffins in one shot. My old toaster I had to use the toast cycle twice before it was done. Could have wider and longer slots.
5,Great toaster!,"I was grateful that my piece of crap toaster finally died and I was able to justify purchasing a new one. And man, what an improvement! This toaster has a great retro design and I love the sturdiness of it. And to top it off- it toasts beautifully!!"
4,Haier toaster,Haier TST850DS Die-Cast Stainless-Steel 2-Slice ToasterBest toaster for the money. It is easy to run and does what the claims claim. Reminds me of the twenty plus year old Sunbeam toaster that finally wore out.
4,great inexpensive toaster,"as the other reviews say, this is a very good inexpensive toaster. no problems at all - it does everything we need it to do - which is to say that it works beautifully as a basic toaster."
2,slow heating toaster,"I thought I would step up to a higher rated toaster but after 1 years use I can tell you this is not worth the money. It takes a very long time to toast bread and the toast isn't done evenly and it's been doing this since day one. It is possible I got a lemon out of the bunch but when you buy a product that is supposed to be a quality item such as this, that shouldn't happen. In fact if you go to the Haier website they don't even make this toaster any longer, the page states says inactive item. BUYER BEWARE!!!! I would not reccomend this toaster to anyone based on the experiences i have had with mine."
4,toaster,"this toaster seems to be a good value for the price. My only complaint would be that the inside burners don't seem to glow evenly like the outside one's, and of course that is the one's that are used when you toast a bagel. I would buy it again."
3,Strictly Fantasy,"If you have not yet read anything about the life of Diego Rivera, don't start with this book. While Rivera's re-imagining of his life is riveting, it is merely one more tall tale. Rivera is known for many talents, however, sticking to the truth is not one of them.If you already have a solid background in the artists life, then by all means read this book to get a sharper insight into his mental inner-workings!"
4,interesting,"Diego's own stories are interesting and adventurous. Some seem a little far-fetched, but could be the truth in the eye of the beholder. It depends on your position on accuracy of facts...I enjoyed the book immensely but didn't take it too seriously."
5,He's just too talented,"Davila is one of those illustrators who makes you hate illustrators. His talent is disgusting in that it is obviously some sort of God-given right. The man can take a pen to paper and create an image that seems to be living.Here he shares the secrets of drawing for not just the graphic novel (ah hem, comic book) but for drawing in general. I doubt I will ever be able to sit down and in a minute or two bring characterization to an illustration the way Davila can, but at least I now have an idea of where to start.I bought this book for my six-year-old nephew, who loves superheroes, my fiveyear-old son, who loves superheroes, my 36-year-old brother-in-law, who loves to draw superheroes, and myself, who wishes to have a talent for drawing. Period.This book is perfect for anyone from the age of 5-100."
3,good for small/ tight situations,"I tried to save a few dollars in purchasing a number of Stanley products....what a foolish mistake.....I should have gone with the better products (Klein, for example)....this is nothing beyond mediocre."
2,Do not buy it!,It looks cool and I ordered one. It turns out a bad choice. The product is totally ineffective. Do not buy this unless you want to end up returning it like me.
1,A piece of junk!,It went bad after 2 use. I did not feel anything except for unfortable with it on! Massage?? I doubt! At least I did not see the result!
2,Very Disapointed!,"Despite running my Cool Mist 24 hours a day in my very small 28% humidity apartment, the unit was never able to bring the humidity up past 45%. The tank was full, the wick was wetted (as per instructions), and yet the noisy unit only dispersed about 1.5 gallons into the air per day. What should have happened was that I should have been refilling the tank every few hours until saturation level was reached. The unit is very inefficient at getting the moisture into the air. I've done better letting a tea pot sit on simmer on the stove. The Honeywell unit is also extremely noisy, even at the lowest speed. It's impossible to have it in the same room as ones self running at full speed, it's just too annoying."
2,Keeps Breaking,"It does a great job humidifying, but the fan keeps squeeking. I have replaced it twice, but the next one works well for a couple of months, then starts to squeek again. I would try to fix it myself, but they have the safety screws that require special tools.I would not recommend this product. The Holmes that I have works much better."
4,RGB OR VGA COMPUTER TO TV,I like this IT WORKS GREAT BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN AUDIO CORD OR USE EXTERNAL SPEAKERS FROM THE COMPUTER FOR SOUND
2,poor output quality despite good physical quality,"They feel good, the cable itself feels heavy duty and of good quality. Unfortunately when plugged from my laptop to my 52"" TV, there are visible flickering lines. I thought it might be my TV or Laptop but tried another VGA cable my friend lent me, and the lines were no longer there, hence bad cable. I guess it's hit or miss whether or not you get a good or bad cable."
5,Good VGA cable,"It is thick, which is nice, but not too thick. It is a VGA cable, I personally can't see any big difference between this and a normal VGA cable, nor did I expect to really. To be honest, I expected it to be longer. It seems 6-feet isn't that long nowadays, I have seen this with the other cables I have purchased with this from Amazon. Next time I buy any kind of cables I am going to go with 10-ft but 6-ft isn't too bad unless you have things at a distance like I do. I could still connect it to my monitor so that is nice. Just make sure you know how long you want your cables. But this shouldn't discredit the VGA cable. It is still nice so it deserves 5 stars!"
1,Bad Experience With This Cable,"Based on the reviews, I bought this cord because it sounded like it would be very good quality. however, it seems like I got the lemon in the bunch. My cord had problems with ghosting of images on displays. I tried it on 3 different monitors just to confirm it was the cord. Currently, I am in the process of trying to return the cord, and I will update my review if I receive a better cord. In other reviews, it sounds like lots of people got cords that worked well, but I thought I would just warn that they aren't all great."
1,You get what you pay for - JUNKY CABLE!!! BUMMER,Bought two of these cables last week for a tradeshow in Las Vegas. Wanted to connect the laptop to a HDTV ... all went well with the first one. Then I hooked up the second one and the color was all screwed up. I messed with the laptop and the TV for two hours before swapping the cables. YEP - the cable was bad! Try to find one of these on short notice in Las Vegas for a tradeshow!!!! Should have bought something of higher quality - where is the quality control????????
5,Works great. No ghosts,I use it with a projector running at 1024x768 60Hz. The image quality is very good. I could not see any ghosting or any other issues.
1,Did not work as it should,I had issues with this cable right from the first day.I somehow got it working for my IBM ThinkPad with high resolution after couple of days. But never for my 3+ year old Dell Inspiron. I blamed my old laptop for this until I used another VGA cable which just worked fine without any kind of hassle for my ThinkPad and Dell.
1,Cable from satisfaction4u is a faker,"Got this cable to connect my laptop to my 32'' LCD HD TV but it dint work, hell the cable from satisfaction4u doesn't even have 15 pins it only has 14. Is a cheap gray generic piece ofjunk. A super cheap cable is only good if it actually work."
1,Good only for some monitors!!,"OK, so this cable is good, but ONLY for standard resolutions, such as 1280x1024. If you have a monitor that does not use standard resolutions (eg. 1366x768), the cable will not recognize the default resolution.In the end: Good cable for monitors that do not support (or don't need to support) plug and play. Otherwise, you'll be stuck with a std. resolution that will suck.Tis."
1,Get what you pay for,"Cheap product, made cheaply and hardly works.not ok.i would return it but its not worth my while."
2,Would not buy again,"I was able to run this behind two couches and a tv, so essentially a well hidden cable from my laptop to the tv.It worked great initially, and had I written the review right then, would have been 5 stars.However, after using it once for a few hours to watch some Hulu, I came back to it a few days later, and found the sound cable ran next to it buzzed, and the picture flickered a great deal.Did some testing, and it looks like the cable just isn't shielded very well. Lots of interference, I'm looking for a new solution for my ""long distance computer to tv"" needs."
1,Overrated cable,"I bought this cable because of the high reviews it received on amazon. I was going to use it to connect my laptop to my 24"" lg lcd monitor. But at 1900x1200 this cable's image reproduction was far worse than the default cable I received with the monitor. There was a slight flickering to the images, and yes I double-checked to make sure the connections were secure.Also, in the image it shows that there is a ferrite core at each end of the cable. But there is only one ferrite core on one end of the cable that I received. This also makes it worse than the default monitor cable I received which has one on both ends."
4,MXT 101MMHQ 6' Coax SVGA Monitor Cable,"Very good product, connects very easily to my laptop and TV. In hindsight, I would have opted for a longer cord but this one does the job so length is a minor detail at this point. Only downside is that the cord is unable to transfer audio from my laptop to the TV, so I am forced to either use the laptop's speakers or connect the speakers of my desktop to the laptop for better sound."
3,So-so performance,"Hooking up my laptop to my HDTV with these VGA cables, there was a little bit of ghosting. It wasn't as bad as I've seen with other comparable cables, but it wasn't the best either. Considering the cost, it's about average."
5,IT WORKS GREAT,"IT WORKS GREAT WITH BOTH MY HP COMPUTERS..WITH MY BIG SCREEN TV .NOW I CAN WATCH MY NETFLIX , PLAY COMPUTER GAMES N DVDS FROM MY COMPUTER ON MY LIVING ROOM TV..IM SO EXCITED..GOTTA LOVE AMAZON"
5,from small to big :),"It came in fast, well packaged. Was long enough to reach from my laptop to my 32"" TV. I have it set up as a dual monitor and can switch between that or the regular channels."
3,"Great Picture, Flimsy Connection (will update when replacement arrives)","This cable completely fixed the ghosting problem I had with my old, lower-quality cable. However, there was something wrong with the connection and seemed loose - any vibration would cause the picture to become blue, as if one of the signals wasn't connected right. I could go hold the cable in place to fix the problem, but that wouldn't be very convenient! I will make sure to update once I recevie a replacement from amazon."
1,EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED! HORRIBLE QUALITY,"There is nothing good to say about this cable. I read the reviews and hoped for the best since it has more good than bad. I hooked it up today to my laptop using my HDTV as a projector and there are scan lines on the picture that wont go away, I tried screwing the cable into the back of the tv rather than just plugging it in. Checked the connection between the laptop and the cable. Everything was fine. This cable sucks. DO NOT BUY.There is no point in sending it back because I dont want to pay for shipping. I got screwed out of $5. Will never buy from Westronics INC again."
3,Feels Fragile,"The product is fine, just feels fragile, but it does what it's told. Has Good Quality Picture, I have a feeling it might not last as long as i want it to, so i would recommend buying this at your own risk in a way"
1,ghosting,"I bought this cable to connect an HP 2159M LCD panel to a Lenovo T61. I'm experiencing high levels of ghosting. Although plugging the audio cable interestingly reduces the amount of ghosting, it is still unbearable. Lastly, it does not have ferrites as shown in the picture. I don't recommend this cable with high resolution new generation LCD panels."
1,Wouldn't detect monitor,My monitor has a 1680x1050 resolution and the video card could not detect it using this cable. It would only detect it as a generic non-PnP monitor. I swapped it with a different cable and it worked perfectly. This is on Windows 7.
4,Works Very Well,"I bought this item to hook up my laptop to my HDTV to watch progamming broadcast over the net (netflix, ABC, nbc, cbs, etc etc). All I can say is it does the job quite well. I can watch my programs through my tv along with a audio cable which you can also get through amazon. For the price I paid, I can't complain. I highly recommend removing it and safely storing it between uses to maintain its properly."
1,Does not work...display lines across monitor,"I used the cable to hook up my laptop with my AOC LED monitor, but discolored streaks kept appearing on the monitor.I know that the monitor is not faulty since I used a good VGA cable and everything worked fine. It's not even worth the effort to return this junk."
1,does not work,"tried this cable with two different laptops (mac and PC) and two different monitors (LCD computer monitor and HDTV). Did not work with any of them. by the time i figured out it was the cable that was the problem and not my computer settings, it was too late to return it. DO NOT BUY."
2,Not seeing the high resolution,"The cord works and it arrived quickly (as most everything I order on amazon does). However the picture does not expand to 1080 on my projector when I use this cord. Yet when I use my old blue VGA cord the picture expands just fine. I also noticed some blur lines going across the screen. All in all I'm not pleased with the product. It was less than $10 though so I'm just gonna toss it in a box with the rest of my extra cords. If I really needed something in a pinch it will do, but its not adequate for my HD home theater system."
4,great price,"I just bought an HD tv so I was looking for a vga cable. All the stores really only had 6ft cables and it wasn't long enough for my computer. I found this one, at a cheaper price than the 6ft one at the stores. it was a great deal."
1,Very dissapointed!!,"OMG, I received this product yesterday, and It did not work at all!! Anyone who buy this product will be very frustrated."
2,20% Cut off @ 1080p resolution!,"I bought this wire and i still use it but there is a Major flaw. When i connect my laptop to my samsung led tv @1080p resolution, there is cut off on the left side of the screen. I would say about 20%. This is annoying because i have a shorter VGA cable that came with a projector i use to own and there is no cut off."
3,Will never know.,I can't really rate this. I ordered it in error where as i should have ordered a VGA to HDMI-D cable. Although the delivery was great.
2,Be aware of the seller ABACUS24-7 of this cable!,"The cable I got was not like the one that is pictured on the amazon.com web page. The one that I got from the seller is of light gray color (instead of black) and looked to be of a lower quality model. Since it worked well enough for my purpose and is relatively cheap, I did not ask for a return, but I was disappointed. It feels like being cheated on a cheap basis. I would not recommend this seller. Unfortunately, this was the only seller, ABACUS24-7, listed by amazon.com for a 6 ft cable, so even I had suspicions about it, I had no choice, but to risk it."
2,No sound,"Ok so I first left a message in here explaining that the product is good for image but it doesn't reproduce sound, I also said that the company was good, very nice and fast shipment ... No problem, I was just trying to help others that were seeking the same as me.The company contact me and asked me to erase my comment trying to fix my problem... after I erased it they ignored me, so I' m leaving my comment again."
1,"Serious ""ghosting"" of images","I bought this cord to hook my computer up to a LCD Display. I also experienced serious ghosting of images on my Sony LCD Display. When I use back the previous cord, everything is fine. No ghosting of images! I am going to return the cord, and I will update my review if I receive a better one."
1,Do not buy this cable,"I thought it's a great deal given the price, and I didn't think a cable would make such differences in picture quality.Basically, the picture quality is so low that my eyes hurt. Letters look all blurred. Moving pictures seem to be fine, though. However, if you were to read a lot on your monitor, like me, stay away.I replaced it to a 20$ cable sold at Best Buy. It completely changed the picture quality. What you pay is what you get. Don't settle with this cable in the hopes that you'd save several bugs."
2,Warped Plastic,"The cable ends were warped like they had been sitting out in the sun, making it difficult to screw in the connections."
2,Only Temporary,"I also originally bought this cable based on the good reviews.For me the quality of the picture was not the issue initially, but how long the cable works correctly.The first few months the cable worked fine and I was able to use my LCD TV as another monitor for my laptop.However over time something had gotten loose and now the picture is green. So I am guesing one of the color cables.Mind you I am not hard on the cable and I actually never moved it after it was hooked up.So you get what you pay for I suppose.Decent but probably will not last you very long."
1,Heavy Cable,"Heavy cable that I use to hook up my laptop to a HDTV. No interferance with other electronics, picture was clear for 6 months. Then picture turned yellow. That's right, picture had a yellow tint that would not go away. Replaced this VGA wire and picture is perfect. There is no external damage to the wire, so sometime inside the loom must have come apart. The heaviness of the wire disguises the poor quality."
5,Great Quality,"This cable has good video quality, the construction materials looks good too, i prefer a long one that way i can move it all around my desk, overall this cable works great for me"
5,Good Picture,"Great quality and good picture, this cable works great for me so far, i got it for my projector at home instead of get one at retail store for around $30"
1,Functioned for all of 10 seconds.,"Bought 3 of these cables and I needed to add some 2nd sources on a couple of projectors. After using these cables the image flashed on screen for all of 10 seconds, after which nothing. I thought that was weird and brought in a laptop still nothing. Brought in a monitor and still nothing. Switched to a different cable (came with projector) and it works from computer or laptop to either projector or monitor. Ok so tried 2nd cable. Works! restart computer after small change, no image again....Long story short, 3 cables... 3 no images after a short time. Maybe just a bad batch for me, but it did not work.Seller was great throughout however, product not so much."
5,Does what it's designed to,"Just like Creation (but on a much less grander scale), it's designed to do what it does do, and what it does do it does do well. Good product; good price. Recommended!"
1,Do not buy from UCable,"Based on other reviews I thought I would take a chance on this. It seems that there are different quality cables being sold under the same listing dependent upon who you buy from. Do not buy this from UCable because they are selling an extremely low quality cable. I immediately had severe ghosting when I hooked it up. I tried the cable with three monitors and it caused severe ghosting on all of them, I also checked the monitors with other cables and they all work great. When I tried contacting them for a refund for a defective product they told me that VGA cables are not for High Resolution displays like LCDs but only for CRTs (not true and contradicts the product description). Then they told me to write ""Return to Sender"" on the package to send it back, which wouldn't have worked since the package was already open."
4,Great cable for good price,"The vga cable worked great to plug my laptop on a lcd tv, the image was great and so is the price"
5,Nothing short of perfect,"All I have to say about this little thing is that it works perfectly. I had no problems using it, and it plugged in nicely with both my computer and my HDTV. No problems at all! I think when I go to purchase another monitor for my other computer, I will definitely purchase this cable again along with a splitter. This was totally worth the buy."
2,Cheap product,"I used the cable to connect my laptop to a projector. It worked fine for the first couple of months. I used it maybe once every 3 weeks. After that first couple of months the projector was not able to read the laptop. I had to make sure it was the cable before writing this review, and it is the cable because the projector is working fine with a different (and older) VGA wire. I guess you get what you paid for."
1,No good,"POS! You get what you pay for and this cord lacks in every way possible. The cord hardly works, picture is distorted, cannot even use. Do not recommend getting this product!"
5,Good quality!,"I have no problems with ghosting or anything with these cables -- very heavy-duty cable, very high-quality image. Worth every penny!"
4,does the job,"great heavy cable, I see no noticeable signal loss, does it's job, what more do you want?"
4,Great product that delivers!,I ordered this to hook up my IBM laptop to my new 52 inch LCD panel. I am using it to write my review. It looks great and having the extra length cord is really nice. I highly recommend to anyone who needs this setup. Great color and picture reproduction. I only gave it four stars because it does not have a built in audio connection which means I have to run another cable for sound.
2,Extremely Low Quality,"I bought one a few weeks ago and it has already gone bad. The pins are fragile and if you are going to be plugging it in and out very often, definitely don't get this one!"
4,Good - but cable from Bargaincell doesn't have ferrite as pictured,"About the product: Cable works fine, no noticable ghosting.About my experience (I am sharing this part because Bargaincell is the top listed purchase option for this item - does not enter into my rating of the product):Note that the photo shown on the Amazon website depicts a ferrite filter at one end. The cable that I received from Bargaincell did not have this. I contacted Bargaincell and they offered to credit me about 15% of my purchase price for the inconvenience. They told me it was a listing error. This occurred over a week ago and the listing on Amazon has still not been corrected.Note that I recently ordered a 6 foot shielded VGA cableRiteAV - SVGA Monitor Cable - 6 Ft.from RiteAV (another Amazon partner.) This cable did have ferrite filters on both ends of the cable. And RiteAV shipping was lightning fast. If you don't need the additional length I highly recommend this option."
5,SVGA CAble,Good bang for the buck. Everything that I need. I can use my computer from the couch and view it on the 47 flatscreen.
1,Bad Cable,"I bought this Hddb15m/hddb15m cable on the amount of reviews that the cable was just fine. After hooking it up to the TV, the screen was blue and could not be changed. I have a shorter VGA cable and it works perfectly. The price of the 25 footer was great and the shipping was a little expensive so now it is not worth the shipping in sending it back. I guess I got what I paid for and now I am stuck at 13-15 dollars in the hole. I guess some things are worth buying local because the returns or exchanges are easier and cheaper."
5,Great cable for linking computer to t.v.,"Got this so I can link my netbook to my LCD t.v., works great and the view is brilliant."
4,VGA Cable,Product arrived earlier than expected as usual. Product is as promised and works fine. No issues.
3,Wouldn't buy this again,Installation was not smooth. Using this to add a third monitor. It works....just doesn't work 100% correctly. Wouldn't purchase this product again.
3,Good product,This cable is good made. Have a very nice structure an lenght too. It came to my house on time.Thanks
3,PC to TV,"I used this cord with my older laptop so that I could connect my PC to my TV. It works well and the image quality is excellent. The only problem with VGA is that it doesn't transmit sound, so you're stuck with the audio coming strictly from the PC - which is alright if you have nice speakers, but annoying regardless.I suggest using an HDMI cable, however if you don't have a newer computer and TV you will have to find an adapter. HDMI sends the highest quality picture AND sound, which allows you to recieve the audio from your TV.VGA is good but it's bulky and not easily hidden. HDMI is the new thing, it's quality and sleek which keeps your set-up looking clean and organized."
1,Be aware of the plugs direction,"I bought this unit to connect my computer to the PC-to-TV converter. The plug's both sides of the cable has the same polirity (male), which makes impossible to use in my scenario."
5,Perfect in every way,"I'm using this cable to connect my computer to my TV, and it works like a charm. This is a very sturdy cable, and can take a lot of abuse (it's stretches all the way across a vent heater getting to the TV). There is no loss of image quality even over 25 feet, making this just about perfect in every way."
1,Bad Wire,"For 6 hours I thought it was the way I was hooking something up ,only to find out it was a bad wire...I had to go and buy another wire the next day...I had already disposed of the package it came in...This might be my lesson with wires online..."
2,Not impressed. Lots of flickering waives through my TV.,The picture quality is not good with the cable I bought. There are flickering bars throughout the screen. I recommend spending more money if necessary and getting something that does not kill your picture quality and viewing enjoyment.
5,Great quality,"Great stuff. I ordered a vga splitter, a 20-feet vga cable and a 10-feet computer power cord and the quality of all those products were excellent. It's definitely better and cheaper than the ones you get at regular computer supply stores."
2,VGA Cable,"Wanted this cable to hook my computer to my TV, to show movies that are downloaded on my computer to my TV. I had purchased a more expensive one but then saw this so I ordered it, however it does not work the picture does not go onto my TV. I contacted the place where I purchased this but never received a response from them. Oh well I will not purchase from them again."
5,good product.,"I plug it from a laptop to a monitor. I have a lennovo laptop and I wanted to have a duplicate view on a monitor, so I preesed the buttons: FN&F7 simultaneously. and it worked."
4,Works very well for my purpose,I acquired a LCD monitor without the VGA cable and ordered this one as a replacement. I'm running it at 1280x1024 60Hz refresh (native resolution for this 19 in monitor) and it works perfectly.
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this product expecting that it's gonna be better than the original VGA cable which came with my monitor.However, not only is there no improvement, but the picture quality is actually much worse. It did not work well with either a PC monitor or HDTV.Also be aware that there are many different vendors selling the same product. I purchased it from WowPart. Not sure if the inferior quality and mixed reviews of this product have anything to do with the fact that there are so many different vendors.The shipping and handling are fine, so I wouldn't leave a negative review for the vendor, but the product itself is really of disappointing quality."
2,NG for High Resolution,The 25 foot cable would not allow transmission of 1920x1080 images from a Dell laptop to a Sony Bravia 1920x1080 TV. An Office Depot 15 foot cable worked well. The supplier said it was a cable length issue.
4,Works fine for me,Build quality seems decent. Works fine for me. I hook my computer up to my new HiDef large screen TV.
1,Glad I used a giftcard,"I bought this to connect laptop to TV. It worked fine at first but less than a week after using it, it stopped working. No bueno. What do you expect for $6 though?"
2,Did not work for me,"I bought this to put PC signal on my monitor and my TV. The signal was weak and made both desktop monitor & LCD tv jump, blur, etc... I ended up buying an electronic splitter which works great. See my other reviews"
4,True,"I saw the Robbie Seay Band open for Shane & Shane last year and wasn't immediately impressed, but I eventually looked them up online, sampled this CD and bought it right away. Couldn't quite say what group RSB is similar to--and that's probably a good thing. The lyrics are simple and honest, and Robbie demonstrates his ability to arrange great songs. Definitely buy it--find Ten Thousand Charms (and other CDs by Robbie) at independentbands.com or grassrootsmusic.com. This is a sincere praise offering that I'm sure is a sweet-smelling savor to our Lord."
2,Save your money!,"Why this package was released is beyond me. Other than for nostalgia's sake, I suggest the hard-core fans pass on this one. Disc 1, featuring James Dewar is worthwhile even though the sound quality borders on 'bootleg' quality. Disc 2 featuring the 'trio' is a frisbee, you can't really understand the vocalist, he sort of mumbles his way through. Blank booklet is a shocker."
5,Buy this for disc one and zone out!!,"I just found this in a pile of discs from days gone by. I was at the 74 show in Pittsburgh, and I must say, re-visiting this tonight makes me thrilled I was there to see this line-up... Jimmy Dewar on bass and vocals = doesn't get any better! Reg Isidore was on fire, and Robin was burning up the frets.. As far as sound quality, except for the first verse of BRIDGE OF SIGHS, this recording is raw and real... I can't find ANY fault in this.. It is full of passion, and the audience was over the top! The second disc = DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.... REST IN PEACE JIMMY - YOU ARE MISSED!!"
4,A haunting score of life's realities by Thomson,"This absolutely brilliant score by Thomson brings to us a wonderful re-creation of life's realities in the early 1940's Louisiana during the great depression. This movie score is subtle, tender and reflects Thomson's virtuosity that makes us identify ourselves with that period. Especially the score for ""Louisiana Suite"" is captivating."
2,Not so great,"My order arrived earlier than expected so I was very excited. I bought this as a Christmas present for my pilot friend and I hope he won't be too disappointed. The body looks like metal but everything else is plastic. The body's colors are painted but the logos and windows are cheaply adhered stickers. Given the chance, I wouldn't buy this again. This is probably alright for a children's toy, but not so great for someone older in aviation."
4,fan since blue lines.,"I have been an fan of Shara Nelson since the release of the ""Unfinished Sympathy"" track from the Massive Attack 'Blue Lines' album in 1991. I was eagerly awaiting and pleasantly surprised when she released ""What Silence Knows"" back in 1994. That first solo outing solidified her as more that just a vocalist for Massive Attack, earining her awards and accolades for her writing ability. This follow up didn't recieve the attention that ""Silence"" did. It's a shame because it is just as promising, if not more-so than it's predecessor, continuing with the fluid string arrangements, bits of mowtown, urban beats, jazz inflections, abstract, and better production from the likes of Jah Wobble, Tim Simenon(Bomb the Bass), St. Etienne, Pressure Drop and Lucas to name a few. Check her out on the sublime Presence(1999) album along along with another Massive Attack vocalist Sara Jay(Mezzanine)."
2,I was disapointed.,I was looking for a straight up dictionary for the theological terms that eluded me. What I found was that the author frequently succumbs to the temptation to put his spin on the topics. It makes it hard to trust him on the terms that you know nothing about.
2,the inquisition,"I haven't read this book cover to cover but seriously........58 to 60 million people were killed in the inquisition?? However good this book might be in other areas, this number cannot possibly be true."
2,"If Truth By Definition Is Your Aim, Pass This One!","I came across this book, (more appropriately stated versus a""dictionary"" may I add)in our parish library, and had it removedafter careful examination of the author's premise.I was sorely disappointed largely due to the bias and biggotryof the author, Ala Cairns. He promotes religious norms; clearlyan adversary to modern doctrines.To author a dictionary compellsan all encompassing, substantive, impartial presentation thatin essence proficiently speaks ""definitively"" and reflects anecumenical perception and understanding. One would bewell advised to hone their knowledge of theological terms viaa well-balanced, non-subjective source, in sync with the Hereand Now. True knowledge is not limited in scope. Blessings toall who DO NOT buy this book! >Fr. John O'Brien, M.Div."
5,"A Beautiful, Touching book","""Ice-cream wrappers bloomIn overflowing basketsSummer in the Park""Jane YolenThis is a ""haiku"" from the book. Each poem is matched with a memorable picture of the city. The pictures are of everyday scenes and the haiku are easy to read, yet the effect is haunting. Although the book is only 40 pages long, a person could spend hours reading and looking at the pictures.Children and parents and teachers will read this book over and over."
4,classic mexi horror,"This review only reflects ""Curse of the Doll People.""This is one of the best of the black and white mexican horror films of all time. Extremely atmospheric and quite macabre. Unfortunately, CasaNegra was unable to procure an un-edited english version, and as such, the English version given, excludes two great scenes. However, the scenes are included in the Spanish version.The beautiful, statuesque Elvira Quintana, former Miss Mexico and Miss Universe contestant, leads the cast, and steals the show. Watch out for that zombie ghoul! and no, bullets will not stop him! I would have given this five stars if the English version was full length"
4,Kunoichi,"I am a big fan of Rina Takeda,and this was a fun film, though too short, and needed more action. But my friends and I did enjoy the film and hope Rina will get better film roles,she is very talented. So if you are a fan of her, then this is for you."
5,A masterpiece!,"This book is phenomenal: It takes the reader all the way from square one (literally: pencil-and-paper exercises) to solid, intermediate Lisp competence (writing macros, etc.). And it does so painlessly, almost imperceptibly, and with supreme clarity. Touretzky teaches a classic, straightforward Lisp programming style; solutions to all exercises are found at the back of the book, thus making it invaluable for self-study. It's also a wonderful language reference. If you want to learn Lisp, and the basics of functional programming, then begin here. Given the renewed interest in Lisp, this book most definitely should be ""brought back""."
4,Could this happen here?,"C. R. Coombs has woven a tale that provides a thought provoking look at a fictional (or is it?) not-to-distant future United States. The protagonist, Tom Dedlass, is an ordinary man in an America where ordinary freedoms have largely been suspended. He strives to make ends meet by moonlighting as a small part of a vast underground economy. Dedlass interacts directly or indirectly with a variety characters in ways that are often complex and surprising. The author has created a witty and very readable story by combining politics, economics, intrigue and technology. One is left with the haunting thought, ""Could this really happen?"""
5,Snow in Phoenix,I was so intrigued when I saw the ad for this DVD that I had to order it immediately. I am originally from Minnesota and currently live in Phoenix. The only way I know that it is Christmas time here is because my neighbors have lit up the cactus in their front yard. I was pleasantly surprised when I received my box of winter wonderland and even more so when I actually watched it. It is beautiful! I absolutly recommend this video to anyone that misses winter and that holiday feeling. I have watched it over and over and ordered more for my friends and family. Finally there will be a little snow in Phoenix this Christmas!
2,Skip this one,"After reading the reviews and watching the clips for this dvd I anxiously ordered it. Boy were we disappointed. We love nature/relaxation type dvds and have several of them, so can compare new ones with those we own and like. I expected falling snow, there was very little of it. It seemed many of the scenes were clips or freeze framed. Very rarely does a tree move or snow blow , even a tiny bit. Being from the praries and mountains of the midwest I can say nature is hardly ever completely still.So that aspect made the pictures seem less real. There are a couple of beautiful shots of mountains with clouds moving across them and a gorgeous shot of snow falling on a lovely cabin. Other than that there was not much to keep our interest.I would definitely skip this one. A couple of favorite Christmas/winter DVD's we enjoy are: Christmas in New York and The Spirit of Christmas"
4,"Beautiful, breath-taking images!!",I'm really enjoying this DVD. It's full of beautifull and peacefull images of the snow with captivating mountain vistas and snow covered lakes and cabins. I love the accompanying soundtrack and find it very enjoyable and soothing to watch. Each time I see it I notice something different. It's the perfect backdrop to a holiday gathering.
1,"Where are birds, deer, walking in the woods",I now longer can go for walks in the woods or around town.Where is the village square with the New England white chruch?Was there a sunrise or sunset over the mountains or lake?I stopped watching after 30 minutes.maybe it is at the end?The Christmas Carols are fine.Linda22
1,I dont get this book at all,"Im not sure if Hal Leonard is desperate or what is going on but this book is a joke. When you listen to the audio cd this clearly was not recorded live, it is samples. Why learn to play it when you can sequence it? But why would this book be published? What is the use of classical pieces, played on electric guitar, by someone who clearly cant play them? After seeing other reviews on this author Im somehow not suprised at all. Useless, this book is a disgrace!"
5,One of my relatives,"Since he was one of my ancestors, I loved being able to find his CD. I said what I wanted."
2,Doesn't fit FLEX FUEL engines,"The website claims these injectors fit flex fuel engines. My 2004 Tahoe Z71 is a Flex Fuel truck and these injectors won't work. The ""See all vehicles this product fits"" section of this products listing needs to be completely redone. Otherwise, they appear to be high quality injectors at a great price."
5,Good days of ROCK,"Can never have enough great ROCK N ROLL, must grow the collection til it bust or I have no earring left. Long live ROCK N ROLL."
5,The Idolmaker,This movie is great. I watched it as a teenager and had never forgot the wonderful songs they sung. I am so glad to have this movie.
4,I'm really surprised that not one person has mentioned...,".. that the DVD is only the Pan and Scan version, not Widescreen."
5,Great Movie!!,Not a well known movie but very powerful and interesting look on the teen idols of the 50's Was supposedly modeled after the careers of Frankie Avalon ( Tommy ) and Fabian (Cesare) My daughters were obsessed with this movie after I introduced it to them. Peter Gallagher was very young here and Ray Sharkey was excellent. Highly recommend this film to watch.
4,"A must for fans of the ""Philly Sound""","For those of us with the privilege of growing up on the East Coast and witnesses to the sound coming out of Philadelphia in the early 60's, this movie is a must-see. Ray Sharkey shines in his performance here and reminds me what a natural talent he was. He is sorely missed."
5,My Personal Alltime Favorite Movie,"WATCH THIS MOVIE,IT IS A GREAT ONE. WHICH CHARACTER IS BEST VINNIE,TOMMY ""D"",CHESIRE, YOU DECIDE. I KNOW EVERY WORD TO EVERY SONG,ITS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT BRINGS BACK MY CHILDHOOD,I CAN REMEMBER WATCHING IT AT 7YRS OLD IN 1980. A FANTASTIC MOVIE,BUY IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT."
3,Where is the Widescreen dvd?,"I saw this movie when it first came out to the BIG screen. I was so disappointed to see this ""Standard"" screen issue. Surely this deserves an original Widescreen release on DVD. There is so much crap being put out on DVD these days that one wonders if anywone really cares what the consumer wants. This film has great music and is quite entertaining. Hope it is given a decent re-release sometime soon."
5,I own this video,Saw this movie in 1980 and was very impressed with the soundtrack. I then purchased the album and have always wondered why it was not issued in cd form. As for the movie I rate the story and music better than most musicals. Ray Sharkey dancing in the background while Tommy D is singing is a highlight. The only unbelievable aspect is the Memphis part of the movie. I have often wondered what became of Paul Land he was fabulous as Tommy D. I now show my daughter the musical scenes and she just wants to watch them over and over again. Great music Great movie
3,Great sing along!!,"Wow, a great sing a long, great songs, old guy tries to make others a star and in the end he is the star he tires to make others. ."
1,"Color not as shown, horrible DynaDirect Customer Service","The Oak/Black is no where near the light color in the photo. It's much, much darker color. The tower also came damaged (several paint chips in exposed areas).Don't even think about trying to return something to Dynadirect. Their CS department was rude and insulting. They refused to pay return shipping even though they were 100% wrong by ""displaying"" this product incorrectly. You shouldn't have to pay to send back an item you didn't order in the first place. Avoid these guys like the plague."
4,fights,"I liked the sights in this film. The story is touching. Two friends, one helping then protecting the other. The action took a while to get going but, worth the wait."
4,The right stuff,You know the recipe: cute kid + hot male lead = movie worth watching. I loved it. Now I just need to learn Korean and find Won Bin's phone number.
5,best movie of the year,"Great plot, great fights, great characters one cant ask for more in a movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone, even if you are not an action fan."
5,AWESOME ! ! !,"fast pace action held my attention from beginning to end the characters drew me in after a while forgot it was in subtitles made me laugh ,cry wanted to curse.Best movie I have seen in a very long time."
5,Awesome Movie!,"This was a very good movie. This in my opinion is like a Korean version of Taken. The lead character is such a bad ass! I love his scenes and how he took down his enemies. This also has a very realistic feel to the movie, like it doesn't end in this super unbelievable way. This was quite a good movie with a story line that keeps you guessing."
4,"Not a piece of art, but very well crafted ==> Enjoyment to watch!","This was a great action movie of the old school. A good narrative that pulls you into the story. Good action that isn't totally overdone. It is slightly overdone for my taste, but that is a minor point. I don't see the Americans making many of these films anymore."
4,the man from nowhere,very good movie especially. won bin is vey good. i especially like kimm sae-ron she is only 12 years old but i think she is a wonder ful actress.the movie it self is about the traffiking human organs.and the knife fight a the end fo the movie is awesome.the last fifteen minutes of the movie will bring tears to your eyes.i highly recommend this movie.
5,Very exciting!!!,"...exciting fight scenes and great choreography of fight actions. very violent and graphic but excellent visual effects. not for faint of heart. at times i feel that this movie is even more exciting than the Bourne Trilogy.watched it the second time and noticed how beautiful and well planned out the camera works were. storyline was very interesting, very edgey. won bin has matured and was very intense in this movie, in addition to being cool and good looking."
3,Intensely violent action film...,"The relationship between the protagonist and the child is touching. If you do not read about the film before watching, the unveiling of the protagonist's identity and history unfolds nicely. This is a basic ""good guy goes solo vs bad guys while cops always a step behind"" plot without any complexity in the characters. Non stop action, suspenseful twists, grisly effects. Extremely detailed and unpleasant violence... especially in the ""good guy kills all the bad guys by himself"" scene required prior to the conclusion for this kind of film."
4,A Korean version of Man on Fire and Transporter,"I usually watch Asian films, mostly Japanese or Chinese. This is my first Korean film and wasn't sure what to think.I watched it with sub-titles as I love hearing the actual language the movie was made in but I know the English titles don't always give the best translations. This is one of those but I think the passion from the actors in this film made me ignore the at times bad English subtitles.It's got plenty of action and loved a few of the fighting scenes. The main hero came off like a pretty face memo guy at first but slowly I started to wonder about his past and motivations. Towards the end of the movie, I was with this guy, wanting him to do what he had to do. I enjoyed the film and think the main actor could easily cross over to American films with his charisma on screen (not sure if he as already)."
4,Great movie!!,Movie easily gets a 5 star but the blu-ray is very simplistic and doesn't offer much..I would recomend a cheaper digital version for keeps. Netflix usually has this in HD :D
4,Suprised,"Being korean I bought this movie just to have something from korea that was bluray. I have several dvds that I wished were bluray but oh well, there's always the future.This movie suprised me, not the biggest fan of action films. This was a touching story about a mysterious neighbor and his misunderstood devotion to a kidnapped child. A little bloody in some parts, and language was an issue at some points, just tastless in certain areas. Overall a good movie that looks great!Go S.K.!"
5,I am digging these korean action films!,"This is a good movie if a little bit slow to get started. If you like action and martial arts, then go check this one out!"
5,Great movie!,"This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in years. On line with The Professional, Taken and Man on Fire, which are in themselves excellent movies, but this Man From Nowhere is like... awesome! A must see for all you action movie lovers. Not for the squemish because of some graphic violence, but its such a good movie, I would still recommend it."
3,Good thing that cute kid was in this.,"This is a good, standard brand action film with unbelievable characters and story line. Plenty of violence. The child actress was excellent. The rest of the cast may also be talented but, if so, they don't get much chance to prove it here."
5,Wow,"..was not expecting this film to be that great. But it was..Now it has become my one of my top five favorite films..A must see, made my eyes well up at the end too..."
4,"Not entirely an original plot, but great entertainment nonetheless","If you're looking for an action flick, you can stop your search here. You won't regret it. Nothing else to say."
1,"same film as ""man on fire""","I'm giving this movie a ZERO. Anyone who watched ""Man On Fire"" will realize this film is a carbon copy. I hate movies that always show the same plot, girl gets kidnapped, man goes on rampage or a brother, family member gets killed and they seek revenge Please do not support people who copy other films."
4,Top Shelf Action,"Anyone who is a fan of action movies knows that the genre is flooded with terrible examples. It feels like your lucky day when you find one that is worthy of your time. This is one of those films that makes you glad you happened upon it. I saw it for free with Amazon Prime and, after viewing, I definitely would not have been sorry if it had cost me a few dollars. Take the time to give this one a chance."
4,The Problem Of Harvesting,"I have to wonder about the sensitivity of reviewers who are interested in this film only because of its ""Action"" & completely ignore the much more important issue of the harvesting of human organs that it addresses. If that subject had not been included in the film it would have only been ""just another action flick."""
4,Great,This was a good action movie and it also had some funny parts. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and even if you don't you will probably enjoy this movie.
2,Bloody and Manipulative,"Sorry to buck the trend, here, but not my type of film. Should have read the reviews first, not just the ratings.Sure, the little girl was adorable and drove the plotline, but all the martial arts stuff and the added gore with organ and eye removal was just was way over the top. It was all just a huge vengefest that led to the tearful reunion at the finish.Isn't there enough crap in the world without mislabeling it as 'entertainment'?Ugh."
3,"Rip Off of ""Man on Fire""","Not a bad film, but a direct ripoff of Man on Fire, with kung fu fighting and sappy music thrown in."
1,waste,"poor story, non sense action, over violence,wasted time reading sub titles, better watch ""taken""which has similar story and better action, this one goes togarbage"
1,Ok,"better than most movies of this type, but very very poor story line, lot of the sleuthing just does not connect up. Sorry, but I'm a stickler for solid story line, --good heart and camera work, too many dots not connected properly"
1,alot of violence with no satisfaction at the end,"""The man from no where"" goes no where with the plot. It is a movie with lots of violence to find a missing child. And by the end of the movie the child is still orphaned, living on the streets. The hero is a broken person who goes to jail. What a downer, disappointment."
2,Not what I expected.....,"I thought this was going to be super action-packed. I mean, that's what the description leads you to believe. Not so. Instead of showing this guy kicking butt and moving faster than the human eye can see, you just see the aftermath and get people talking about, ""You should've seen him! He was unbelievable."" Wtf???!!!! What kind of crap is that? I actually wanted to see some real action. Call me crazy, but would some fight scenes be too much to ask for in an ""action movie?""Now, mind you. This guy, Won Bin, was rather attractive, but that's really all I got from this film. I didn't even get his whole relationship with the little girl. He acted like he just had to go and save her, but he barely knew her. Even she was surprised to see him coming to save her. Ridiculous. They really didn't develop their relationship enough.I don't know. I just really wasn't impressed with the film. If you are looking for real action, keep looking--don't stop here cause this film does NOT have it."
2,shoddy technology makes for poor film continuity,"After looking forward to this film, I was greatly disappointed by the quality of the dvd. It stops and stutters and is impossible to follow the subtitles which are partly in Korean and partly truncated english. I would have returned it but had cleared out email.What I could tell from the plot it was same old, same old. Strong silent type hero who (big surprise) was a former secret operative, cute lost little girl with a junkie mom and tons of thugs.Lesson Learned: Never clear out email until after seeing the movie."
4,question,"i want to get this dvd, but notice that both the language and subtitles are english. Does this mean that this movie is dubbed in english? I really hate dubbed movies, so won't buy it if it is dubbed. Any infor will help....thanx in advance"
3,Something happened,"I have been ordering this tape from various suppliers for almost 4 years now and something has changed recently. My last two orders, going back about 6-7 months have not been the same. The packaging looks identical and the numbers are the same but the adhesive is different. This tape never used to fail (come loose) when left on for 14-16 hours at a time. Now however it fails daily. Anywhere from 8-12 hours after application. Very disheartening. I guess I'll have to look for another style/brand. Why can't things just stay the same?"
3,Good but incomplete,"The main obstacle in preparing a Yes greatest hits package is that most of their songs are incredibly long, making it impossible to fit all the good ones on a single disc. What is here is great, memorable tracks like ""Heart of the Sunrise"" and ""And You And I."" However, other reviewers before me have noted that many key tracks are missing - ""Roundabout"", ""Close to the Edge"", ""Wonderous Stories"" and others. A double set might have worked to fit everything in, but as it is, the original albums are a better choice."
2,This Is The Best?,"Now, before i start my reviw, let me first say: I don't own this album. But, BUT, i AM familiar with all of Yes' songs, and let mwe ask this: Where are 'Wondrous Stories', 'Close To The Edge', 'Ritual', 'Starship Trooper', 'I've Seen All Good People', etc., etc. A Best of Yes would HAVE to be 2 discs, itis impossible for all their great songs to fit on 1. Why release this, when there is a Classic Yes album? Ok, this adds some songs that came out after Classic Yes, and it adds some songs that weren't put on Classic Yes, but they really screwed this one up. If your interested in Yes, by 'Classic Yes' if your a longtime fan, i wouldn't bother with this. Is this some sort of marketing-thing that the record company is trying to pull?"
1,Bad Anthology Album,"Don't be fooled by the title. This album is not by a longshot ""The Best of Yes."" Where are ""Roundabout,"" ""Starship Trooper,"" ""I've Seen All Good People,"" ""Long Distance Runaround,"" ""Wonderous Stories"" and ""Leave It"" just to name a few? They only song included that really qualifies as a Best Of is ""Owner of a Lonley Heart."" Skip this collection and go with ""Highlights: The Very Best of Yes"" instead."
5,Perfect addition!!!!,Put together an American Idol for my granddaughter. This made her really stand out! Well constructed. She still plays with it!!!
1,Great idea - horrible implementation,"Pros: Incredible small size; can literally be carried in your pocket;Cons: Video quality mediocre at best (740x320); transferring data files from IP7 to PC has been a nightmare. Literally 25-30 hours of work with varying degrees of usefull tech support (Sony drops the ball on this one) - Formats available are MPG1 and a form of MPG2 called TR - File must then be translated- this is explained in the following website http://134.102.55.200/haupt/SonyIP7_to_MPEG2-PS.htmIn summary, I would wait at least another year or two, when the kinks have been knocked out. This leaves to much to be desired."
1,The worst...,"Lousy camera. Small and portable but lousy picture, hard to find micro tapes, and it broke in three different ways within a short period of time.It's discontinued I've heard. Sony should refund full purchase price to all buyers of this piece of...malfunctioning mess."
1,Huge Disappointment,"This camera was a gift, and it was so bad, that I returned it to a store that it wasn't purchased from, and traded for a camera that is ... less but works better. Sony neglected to inform Mac users that this camera doesn't work with Macs. The box says that it is Mac compatible, but upon further review, you see that it is only compatible for Mac if you are trying to download pictures, not video. If that's all I wanted it for, I'd have bought a digital camera. The TRV27 works much better, is more ergonomic, has a bigger LCD screen, and is compatible with most if not all home computers. To the makers of Sony - why come out w/micro mv if there isn't any supporting hardware/software? As far as I'm concerned, the IPB-7T is merely a ... paperweight!!P.S. All of you PC users out there, GO GET A MAC!!!"
1,terrible color and picture quality....,"The size of the DCRIP7 is fantastic. Great tohold, really slides into your pocket, and all the knobsare quite functional given the size of the camcorder.However, no matter what the form factor, the bottom lineon any camcorder is the color and picture quality. Ifit were not for the form factor, I would give this arating of zero!The color, focus, and clarity [stink] big time. Make sure youproject the output of the camera directly onto a computeror TV set, and not make a judgement based on the imageon the LCD screen. I took my unit back and demonstratedwhat I was talking about with the unit on the floor.Same thing. Red objects look different, focus is terrible,(so much for the CZ lens), and the image is grainy.Very disappointed!!"
1,Do not buy this camcorder!,"First of all, the Bluetooth feature is absolutely useless. You can only use it to upload to Sony's website using a 56k dialup. Forget about using it to upload videos.Second, it uses a Sony proprietary video format called MicroMV. As such, can only use the bundled MovieShaker to import and edit your video footage. This doesn't seem to be a big deal except that MovieShaker is extremely slow.Do yourself a favor, do a search on the web for reviews of this unit. I returned mine ..."
1,Nightmare,"Doesn't work with my MAC. Nightmare trying to download on PC. Sometimes works w/ an i.Link port on a Sony computer. Now it doesnt' even do that. Sometimes worked on a 3rd party FireWire card for my PC, but I had to pull card out and re-install everytime to try to get it to capture. Now that doesn't even work. MPEG2 bites, must convert w/ DOS program. MovieShaker is the worst. I hate this camera w/ a passion. I'm going to throw mine ($$$$!) away or sell it on [other online site]. Anybody want mine? I'm going to get one that plugs directly into my iMac."
5,Buy it!,This CD has become one of my favorite albums.Buy it. You're gonna like it.Trust me.There's nothing really technical about the musiic but its songwriting at its best.Inger hits me as being an artist who really doesn't give a hoot about what key the song is in or what chords are used.She just writes a song and moves on to the next.That's why I like her.She writes off of pure emotion and thats what art is supposed to be eh?
3,This is a wonderful record,"I really liked this album. It's passionate and intense, with a wry, strong voice. Maybe I was able to enjoy it for what it is because I didn't have a preconceived notion of what it ""should"" sound like. Give it a chance. Every time I listen to this record, I like it even more than I did the first time I heard it. If you like PJ Harvey or Patti Smith, you'd probably dig this record too."
2,Dull as a cardboard box,"I got this albulm free from a friend. At first I was jubilant that I had added a new item to my CD collection free of charge. After listening to it however, the old cliche ""If it sound to good to be true, it probably is"" played over and over in my mind. Practically all the songs sound the same and the lyrics are drawn out and ridiculous. Is Lorre really breaking any new ground droning on about the consumption of halluncinogenic drugs? I think not. Should the consumer plop down fifteen dollars on this albulm when there are so many more satisfying choices on the market? I think not. Special note: The album cover did't help the artist score any more stars either. It's a horrible eyesore."
1,Went out the window,"After hearing the Nymphs albulm, I waited years for another albulm from Inger. When my brother brougth this albulm home i happily threw it in my cd player. BOY what a piece of junk it was. I tried to decieve myself by listening to it a few times and tell myself it wasn't that bad, but deep inside...I knew! The only thing I enjoyed about this albulm was throwing it out my bedroom window. To any Nyphms fan thinking of buying this albulm, DON'T! Save yourself the heartbreak and disapointment."
1,Piercing the Veil of Secrecy,"I found the book very bias and the more I read, the more I realized that the author truly has taken a superficial view of the Agency. In short, waste of money and time."
1,Piercing the veil of secrecy,This book certainly did not repeat not unveil anything new and interesting. I found the book to be very one-sided and the opinion(s) and alleged crimes were not fairly presented nor represented. Brookner may have been a fine case officer but she too probably has some skeletons to unveil. She managed to garner information based on hearsay and opinion and not the facts.I regret that she has not given the legal institutions and professionals anything but blah blah as she tries to embark on her new legal career. Luckily I did not purchase this book but instead borrowed it...and returned it too.
1,Cheap,"I'm a flight nurse. We have some old aluminum clipboards that are getting pretty beat up, but are at least 15 years old. This thing wouldn't last a week on transport. Cheap thin metal, loose hinges. Return."
2,good design but lacks strength,I'm in construction and just ordered this clipboard. The design is great but I'll only give it 2 stars due to the lack of material strength. It seems like I could rip it apart easily with my bare hands. Very light and flimsey. It's gonna dent and brake easily. I'd return it if I didn't have to pay the shipping costs. Try another brand if you want something durable.
3,Not impressed,"Honestly it's a pretty flimsy cheap thing. It works, the compartments are nice and it's made in America which is important to me. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and don't have buyers remorse but I wish the material was about twice as thick."
2,Quality,"the clipboard is flimsy, i don't think it wasn't worth it, you can get better quality for the less, or same price at the local office supply store"
1,Flimsy and Broken,"I bought this for my husband to use at work. It arrived quickly, but showed up with the door hinge broken and difficult to close. Overall it seemed very flimsy and poor quality. I was expecting something solid and this was not it. Returned it right away."
2,Cheaply made. qu,quality is lacking. They built better stuff 15 years ago. The metal feels flimsy. I should have bought in a store that I could see and hold.
3,An okay storage clipboard,"It was a lot longer than it said it was so bulkier than I would have liked. It was nice having the compartments though. The clasps to open and shut it were awkward and probably wont last long. It was however, delivered quickly, a good price, and sturdy to write on."
5,Awesome!,"Got this for my daughter for starting clinicals in Paramedic academy. She loves it! Not only is there plenty of room to write up reports, but the inside is roomy enough to stow away a lot of small things (pens,gum,iPhone charger,money,change,etc)"
5,Fascinating,"This book is absolutely fascinating. I recently wrote a paper on gender anatomy in the 18th and 19th century, and this book was my main resource. Laqueur has a clear and well written style as he describes the different theories on gender and sex throughout the ages and the rammifications of these theories in terms of culture and interpersonal relationships."
2,Do not buy this book,"This book is covered with many glowing reviews. What none of them mention is that the author cannot write an intelligible sentence. Sometime in the 80's, perhaps due to the influence of that patent charlatan Derrida, it became fashionable to write lengthy, tortuous sentences using strings of polysyllabic undefined non-words. This book is firmly in that tradition. There may actually be valuable content here, but it's impossible to get at without subjecting yourself to a hideous reading experience. The author, like others in this prose tradition, seems unaware that his style invalidates his content. If he can't be bothered to write a clear sentence, why should we assume that his thoughts are clear? This book is a great opportunity wasted."
1,Aero Paws Smmal Inflatable dog airbed,"I purchased the airbed for my 18 pound dog. He has slept with me in at least three Areo Air mattresses for 8 years and I have never had an issue of his paws going through the mattress. The dog airbed seeped air and was flat by the time I arrived home from work, 10 hours later. So I returned it. I want a maintenance free bed; not a bed that I have to tend to every day. Someone said it was just a bad air mattress. I was relutant, but puchased anyway and wished I had not as it was worse than the first one. I was told to call the service department with Coleman to see if there is a trick to making the air stay in the airbed. Nothing helped; I received a refund for both air beds."
1,The Author must have some lying friends...,"Because this book does not deserve 5 stars by any standard. I had already taken a class in VB and had wanted to go to The Next Level. I picked up this book because it seemed to cover alot and it had the most pages (which I thought meant it had the most info). The author basically hits you from both sides, he doesn't explain the code well and he doesn't print the full code in the book. This causes you to have to keep going back to the CD and figure out the code by yourself which is annoying. Moreover, he tends to begin explaining something and then move on to something else without finishing the explaination. I did eventually get through the whole book but that was only because I'm a CS major and have had the concepts explained to me before in other Programming languages. But I wouldn't suggest this book for anyone, for experienced programmers the constant errors will drive you mad and beginners won't be able to understand it at all."
5,Visual Basic 6 ---- worth your money,"When I first learned Visual Basic, I was self-taught. I did miss a lot of things, until I bought this book. It's been very good on reference and teaching, and it covers a wide variety of techniques. It doesn't matter if you don't know what Visual Basic is, or if you've been programming a year, this book will teach you a lot of things you need to know!"
1,So many mistakes. Makes one want to rip her/his hair out.,"This book had so many coding mistakes in it. Even the corrected code samples on Sybex's Web site had bugs in them. I spent so many days and sleepless nights trying to learn and get the samples working. Half the time, or more, the author would start explaining how a project's code works; and then he'd just go onto something else without finishing what he'd started. TERRIBLY FRUSTRATING BOOK!"
3,Mastering Visual Basic 6 Lacks Indexing,I use this text daily and it has a great deal of information in it for intermediate VB programmers. What I have found is that the index is sorely lacking. I often use the index of other text books to find what I'm looking for then try to cross reference the topic back to Mastering Visual Basic 6.
5,This book is great for all levels,"I found this book quite descriptive and very informative. Even a biginner can follow it easily. The code examples in each chapter are really good and give u a good feel of working of VB. People who are already experienced in programing with VB will also find it very useful as each chapter has something new to know, though a Pro could skip first five chapters, they are very good for beginners. Over all it's a great book to learn from."
3,Good if you are new for VB but not for pros,"I bought this because of previous reviews. It is a good book with LOTS if GOOD info. But, I have been programming in VB for over 5 years. I bought this for the new features of VB6. Well. It touches on some, and I mean some. If your a seasoned programmer look elsewhere, if your a rookie this is a great start, really great!"
5,Excellent Book about VB,This book helped me master VB. Maybe that's why it is called Mastering VB. People who are new to VB or people who have not ever programmed before should steer away from this book. It is an advanced book meant for those who already know the basics of VB. I had been exposed to VB before buying this book so it was easy to pick up on. -mh
5,A Good Book!!!,"Consider the so manny junks in the market place for VB books. This is a good one for serious programmer. Inside out VB techniques and concepts and step by step progamming instructions. I would strongly suggest this book for a serious programmer who wants to migrate to VB. Some bad work in the last two chapters on ASP application and too little ADO, not SQL on VB application and skipping ActiveX Document are the faults of this book. But any way, considering so many junks in the VB book market, this one is a relatively serious copy. Why a below 4-star rating? Good Luck!"
4,Pretty good book for experienced programmers,"The only thing I can add to the other reviews is this: I read this book a year ago, before I had experience programming. I didn't really get a lot out of it. Now that I've used a language professionally (ASP/JavaScript/VBScript) I have a much better grasp and I am able to get a lot out of the book. A book with this many pages is bound to miss covering certain topics in detail--I don't think it is possible to completely cover VB in one book anyway. Buy this book if you have programming knowledge. As far as the editing mistakes: I have a library of 50 large technical books, all of which were rushed to market and have dozens of errors."
2,Not mastering but good beginner's guide,"This book is a good beginner's guide with a lot of examples, but it won't help you that much in real VB development, because the coverage of OOP and database technologies - two skills every intermediate VB developer should have - is poor and unprofessional. Thanks to author I Laughed Out Loud when discovered that drawing shapes and circles is 'Advanced Visual Basic'. Being a VB instructor some time ago I know that all this colors and shapes are attractive only for people starting their road in programming. This book may be good only for people who don't know about 'Common Dialog Control' or still think that it's a part of 'Advanced Visual Basic' too."
2,Save your money and buy a different book,"I have to rate this book low. The organization of the book is lacking, the index is incomplete, and the examples are poor and inadequate. You would think a book this large would be more complete. Many topics are missing. For example, I use visual basic for many file i/o operations and this book does not mention one thing about file i/o. There are better books out there."
3,Should have covered important topics more extensively.,"It sure is hard to find ONE good book on VB. If you can work your way through all of the coding and description errors in this book, you'll at least learn some things. Unfortunately, though, Petroutsos doesn't provide enough examples for one to become very comfortable with important concepts like arrays, functions, procedures, and arguments. After I bought this book I found out that it was written based on a beta version of VB6. At least Sybex, the publisher, provides some code fixes on their Web site. I don't believe that this book will make you a master, but it will give you some good ideas if you place its information beside information from other sources."
1,"A colossal waste of time, money, wood pulp...","This book was a huge disappointment to me. I had hoped that since it contained so many pages there would be a lot of information that I could not get anywhere else. Instead, it turned out to be a beginner's book that is about 600 pages too long. My advice - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Your money would be better spent on your favorite pizza."
4,A special touch for Chinese New Years,The children loved visiting with their new friend for Chinese Years that happened to fall on Valentines Days this year ( 2010 ).
4,Great but too small for all but tiny hands!,"I purchased this puppet for use at puppet shows for library and school programs, and while I have to say he's a big hit with his great fabric (red and shiny gold) and beard, this puppet is most appropriate for use by those with small hands. I'm a woman with only slightly larger than average hand size and I can barely fit two fingers into the dragon's head and definitely cannot be dexterous enough to manipulate it with any real skill, so I rely on arm movements. I love all the Folkmanis puppets I've bought to date (the turtle and the mouse are definitely #1 in my book), and this dragon is no exception but he's the most frustrating of them all. Still, it's a gorgeous puppet and great to see non-Western creatures showing up!"
5,Why change the Title?,"When I saw this new recommendation from Amazon, I was thrilled. I loved Birth of the Chaordic Age, and was eager to learn what new wisdom Dee has to share with us. I checked out the reviews and table of contents and was disappointed to see that One from Many ... is the same book under a new title. Too bad."
1,Nothing but a platform,"Ugh. I couldn't finish this book. I got tired of the sanctimonious self-aggrandizing while putting down everyone else. It's amazing the rest of the world can continue to function without Ms. Astl at the helm! I bought this based on the description, because I was considering pursuing a paralegal tack in my career. I am now pursuing my certificate, in spite of my partial read of this book. I was expecting more ""what working as a paralegal is like"" and less ""every job I took I turned trash in to gold""."
4,Props to Ms. Astl,Props to Ms. Astl on even the first 5 pages of her book. The humor definitely helps all of us in the legal field trying to make it. May she continue to help many others find their ways!
1,Bad toy!,this is a very bad toy do not buy!pros:nonecons: shoots like 1ftgoes o.2mphtakes 5min to make the tank move its cannonsand remote is very bad
4,Theatrical transcriptions from Liszt,"I think Liszt had slightly better luck at the opera, but there's much to enjoy here. Just look at the music, and imagine it transcribed for piano in Liszt's inimitable fashion. Go for it!"
2,Parables of Jesus,Information was good but had trouble when none of the speakers ever looked at the cameras. The outlines were a little hard to follow. The work book follows the video well but just to much to follow at times.
1,Transformed By Trash!,"This book is pure trash.Don't waste your time reading it, because it is a demonic lie. I was there and witnessed this unsuccessful attempt to destroy God's true religion by this demon called: Joseph Tkach Jr.!God's true religion does continue to live on to this very day, and will to the very end.Purchase and read: ""Raising the Ruins"", by Mr. Stephen Flurry, and learn the real truth about how it all happened.You need to know where it is today."
1,Avoid,I have to highly recommend that you give this book a pass. There is a reason that it only costs $1.90.
1,Filled with myths and omissions,"Practically every sentence in the book is twisted and there are manifold untruths and omissions on every page; therefore, all I could do was try to keep track of some of it. (Go to the Exit & Support Network Recovery Page to see the full details.) The worst thing beyond the untruths is the author's obvious lack of feeling for the abuse, suffering and trauma the members and exiters have endured.Almost all of the important dates for significant happenings; i.e., when the WCG leaders met with evangelicals are cleverly omitted. The author tells the world that the WCG is ""Trinitarian"" now, but his mention of the Holy Spirit in the book approaches zero. (To this day I haven't heard members of the Worldwide Church of God admit that they consider God a ""Trinity"".)I consider this book the greatest deception a cult has pulled off in this century. I hope more people research the facts and let the truth speak for itself!Exit & Support Network"
1,"You mean ""Transformed by Lies.""","The Worldwide Church of God has gone from one heresy to another. There is no truth coming out of that ""church,"" or rather, CULT. It never was a fundamentalist church. It's still a cult no matter what kind of spin Tkach and his gang put on it.If they really wanted to be transformed by truth Pope Joey Jr. over in Pasadena would have picked up a King James Bible and let it instruct him. They have a habit of using whatever Bible version (usually one of the corrupt versions--not King James) supports their doctrine.I was in that cult for a few years. Thankfully I am in a Bible-believing independent Baptist church now.I'm not afraid to say that Armstrong was a heretic, so was Joe Sr., and so is Joe Jr."
5,The Band Is Back And Better Than Ever!,"When I heard Racer X had a new album out,I just had to get it. I have been a Racer X fan since 1990 when a friend turned me onto them because of Scott Travis,the drummer.His playing on this album is awesome. So is Paul Gilbert's,one of the best guitar players in the world. The songs all have a very heavy,fast groove to them that is just like Racer X's previous material. I was glad to see that they had gotten back together to record a new album. Hopefully,they'll keep it up and we'll get some more new stuff from them because they rock! I have all of Racer X's albums and this one is just another great chapter in their career. I am hoping they will tour and put out Live Extreme Volume 3.That would be the ultimate,these tracks recorded live along with the older material in a newer live album! Keep up the great music,and rock until there ain't nothing left to rock!"
3,A great band but not their best...,"An all time great band but this is not as good as ""Second Heat"". Worth it for collectors."
5,these technical melodic hell raisers are back!!,"i thimk anyone who is a fan of metal should give this a whirl. everybody plays awesome. paul gilbert melts the guitar,scott pounds your brains in!!, john keps the sound full and thick and jeff martin still has that voice that blows you into the backseat. this is better than say, dokken's new album or heck, alot of albums cant compete with this!! if you do like this get their first and second studio albums, those showed you what shred was in the 80's with ott vox and guitars galore, these guys kick major... their albums will be pricey( thank the label) but a great band comes along once in a great while."
5,Love it but,I love this album but I was expecting a cover of Children of the Grave on it.Very disappointing to find it is not there.
5,OH MY GOD!,It just doesn't get any better than this... Monster rock is what this is. Amazing that these guys can play like this. Please Tour!
2,Extremely Disappointed,I purchased a $170 toaster/convection oven so I also purchased 4 of these so I could use them to bake in it. Perfect size and all of that. When I took them out of the box they had huge labels on the inside bottom and all were extrememly difficult to remove with the exception of one that peeled out where I could see that there was info on the back side of the label. (I had to use Goo Gone on all of them and scrub to get the sticky glue off). I am so thankful that one did come off because on the back of the label it states that these CAN NOT be used in a toaster oven NOR can you use them to broil - both uses of which I intended. This should be stated before purchase and should certainly not be hidden on the back of a label that is hard to peel off. Especially as they are so proud to advertise it can go from oven or microwave directly into frige or freezer.
5,The contrasting achievements of the two navigators thus receive more of an even analysis here,"College-level collections strong in Australian history and early exploration must have Encountering Terra Australis: The Australian Voyages of Nicolas Baudin and Matthew Flinders. It covers the achievements and encounters of these two navigators at the beginning of the 19th century, differing from competitors in examining the voyage of Baudin, rather than Flinders, to provide a different interpretation, reworking facts from the authors' own translation of Baudin's journals and original sources. The contrasting achievements of the two navigators thus receive more of an even analysis here, using both French and Australian sources to authenticate and correct historical facts.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,First Rate,I eschew any impartiality when it comes to Mollie O'Brien. She is a fantastic singer and musician. I enjoyed this disc immensely.
3,"NOT BAD, BUT ALSO NOT GREAT","THE MOVIE IS ABOUT TWO GANGSTAS WHO GET TIRED OF THEIR MURDERS GOING UNRECOGNIZED. BUT WHEN THEY MURDER TWO DOPE FIENDS, THEY MAKE THE FRONT PAGES OF SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS, THEN THEY START DOING MURDERS FOR A MAN NAMED KENYATTA [CLIFTON POWELL], BUT AS THE NUMBER OF MURDERS GROW, THE COPS ARE GETTING CLOSER TO BRINGING THESE THUGS DOWN. NOT MUCH, BUT AT TIMES, IT IS OKAY. YOU GOTTA ADMIT ONE THING, CLIFTON POWELL LOOKS SILLY IN DREADS. THE MOVIE HAS CAMEOS FROM A HOST OF RAPPERS; JA RULE, CHARLI BALTIMORE, CORMEGA, SNOOP DOGG, ANGIE MARTINEZ, AND ICE-T. OF INTEREST ONLY FOR TYRIN TURNER [WHO STARRED IN THE FAMED ''MENACE II SOCIETY''] AND CLIFTON POWELL. OTHERWISE, IT'S JUST YOUR AVERAGE DIRECT TO VIDEO GANGSTA MOVIE."
1,Talented cast is wasted in this pointless film,"Crime Partners is based on a book by one of the greatest black amercian authors Donland Goines. But I imagine Goines is rolling over in his grave after this. In the lead role Tyrin Turner destoys any promise he showed almost ten years ago in Meance II Society. In the form of his sidekick we get a no name actor named John ""B.J."" Bryant who needs some silmfast. Even the always talnted Clifton Powell is wasted and what's up with the wig my brotha had in this movie it's like someone dipped a mop in oil and glued it to his head. As for those who wanna see the movie for the rappers they don't appear until the last fiffteen minutes. This is the reason ghetto cinema has a bad name."
1,One of the worst movies ever made!!!,"I love the ""urban gangsta"" movies. I can watch them all day. This movie was BS. It deserves no stars. The dialogue is terrible, the plot makes no sense... this is really bad. There are times when the dialogue is said twice and you can tell it should have been edited. At one part a girl is talking about someone who got arrested earlier and is in jail. Then the guy who's supposed to be in jail is at the club with them and buys them champagne... what's up with that? Stuff like this happens the whole 100 minutes. Its like they filmed a whole bunch of scenes at a couple of different times and somebody tried to edit it and add in more scenes and come up with something that made some kind of sense. I could act better than this when I was 5. This was sad. This movie took the genre back 40 years."
1,"Movie sucks, Read the Book it's better","This Movie is very poorly put together. I've read the book and it's the first of a 4 part story. This movie dosen't capture what the book does. The Movie Never Die Alone with DMX was based on a Donald Goines novel and that movie was put together properly. This was a low budget film and anyone could've done better. If you want to feel the Movie somewhat you have to read the book first. Donald Goines is one of my Favorite authors, this Movie should've been done a lot better. Check for Never Die Alone with DMX, it's a better movie than this, However Never die alone the book is better than the movie. I give this movie 1 star just cause I've read the book and can see where the movie was going. It was directed poorly and is a disgrace to the Novel."
2,A Big Disappointment,"After reading the synopsis of this movie, I was expecting more than it delivered. I know several people who are fans of the author whose book this was based on, and I'm sure the book was alot better than the movie. The acting was weak and choppy, sometimes to the point of appearing silly. Snoop Dogg (who was so good in ""Baby Boy"")and Ice-T (LOVE watching him on ""Law & Order:SVU) don't even appear until the last half hour of the movie! The best part was the soundtrack. The bottom line is, don't waste your money on this one!"
4,Yummmmmmmmm,"Great product. The fuel is available at any tobacco store and the torch is surprisingly easy to use. The included recipes are even pretty good, just ignore the suggestion to mix brown and white sugar for the topping-that is best when caramelizing under the broiler. So good you may want to get bigger ramekins so you can make even more!"
3,Good but not great,"I was really looking for a book with very detailed photographs of geisha and their kimono and hairstyles (each represents something different, such as seasons etc.) for illustration reference purposes, but this book kind of fell short. A handful of photos are absolutley gorgeous, but a few are a little akward. Many are out of focus and there are several of older women bathing... I think many people can enjoy this book, it all depends on what you are looking for."
2,not at all the real geisha,"This book of uncaptioned photographs is a waste of money. Some of the photos are interesting in a voyeuristic way but without captions or more information about the photos, it seems somewhat like snapshots with a paparazzi quality (as one reviewer commented).I did not feel that the photographer had a deep respect for her subjects nor a great deal of knowledge of the Geisha world which she was allowed to photograph.Some of the shots are simply ridiculous, like the one of the guy getting ""pantsed"" at a party. I mean - what does that have to do with Geisha? Yeah, ok, so they go to parties to entertain and end up playing silly drinking games. What does that tell me about Geisha?If I was Geisha, I would have been embarrassed by this book."
5,Good value for the price,We got this printer included with a notebook PC. I knew it wasn't anexpensive model but was pleasantly surprised at what a good job it didincluding scanning photos and documents. It has been in operation nowfor ~ 2-1/2 years with no problems and it gets a lot of use inreal estate and otherwise.Scanning is a bit time consuming not having a multi-sheet feed but thatis expected in a budget printer.It uses inexpensive generic ink cartridges well (Doubleinks.com) but itis important to read Epsons install directions each time for severalreasons including to avoid wasting ink by improper setup.We plan on getting another more expensive model Epson with faxcapability but will keep using this one as well.
1,"Same old, same old Spencer","I was once a Robert Parker fan but am no more. I'm tired of the same plot, the same characters who never develop, and the same self-satisfied dialog that I assume someone somewhere must find witty.By the way, am I the only one who wants to hurl when Spenser recounts his relationship with Susan? Here's a suggestion for Robert Parker. Give Spencer something to deal with. Perhaps the death of one of his major characters. (I know who I'd vote for.) Then maybe the Spencer series would take off again.Incidentally, if you are interested in reading some contemporary detective writers who are actually producing good work, try Michael Connelly or Robert Crais. And, if you want to see why Spencer is so popular, read some of Robert Parker's earlier works like Catskill Eagle or Double Deuce."
2,How Was Revenge Served?,"I am a fairly good fan of the Spenser/Hawk books. At least I know what to expect concerning dialogue, etc. I even know what kind of shoes the characters wear.This one was fairly predictable. Hawk spoke more Ebonics than usual and of course had to lose his intelligent African-American girlfriend.This time Hawk and Boots, the Ukrainian mob boss, were main protagonists.After the climax of the story, Boots should have been left for a subsequent novel.Parker often has characters reappear in subsequent books.The Gray Man showed up in this one. Boots could have shown up in a sequel, because the final interaction between Hawk and Boots in this book was never fully explained. I think Chapters 58-61 would have made more sense in a later book, with explanation, of course."
4,Mixed bag,I liked it well enough to read in one sitting. It has Parker'stypical fast narrative but not as many humorous remarks.This novel should have been more interesting as it centerson Hawk but I felt the romance between Hawk and his doctorgirlfriend slowed down the pace without adding anythingnew to what we knew about Hawk before.I agree it's not his best but it kept me entertainedfor a night. I didn't want to stop reading until I finished.Kudos to the cover designer. The bullets and I.O.U. perfectlycaptured the theme of this novel.
2,"Alas, A Lackluster Effort","Despite a strong review in the Sunday N.Y. Times Book Review, and despite a nice-if-predictable premise (i.e., Spenser's sidekick, Hawk, gets mortally wounded but summons his strength to eventually do payback), this entry in an overall great series is unfortunately a lackluster effort. Just feels tired and played out. A lot of the action happens offstage, which I suppose is supposed to be refreshing, but only feels unsatisfying. Parker's recent baseball novel about Jackie Robinson was excellent, one of his signature books, so it's not like he doesn't have the chops anymore. Maybe Mr. Parker needs to take a little time off from his annual ""Spenser"" output & build up a creative head of steam for a bigger, better Spenser magnum opus a few years down the road."
2,The Least in the Spenser Series,"I listened to this book on a CD. I hated the narrator especially when he was suppose to be Hawk. Hawk speaking in Afican American dialect really grated on me. It was so phoney. The story wasn't much either. The humor was pathetic. Everything about this book annoyed me. Poor story, stupid humor, and unappealing characters."
4,Cold Service,This was my first Robert B. Parker book and I did enjoy the read but I do prefer Lee Child and Michael Connelly.
3,"As Spenser Novels Go, a solid B","Decent Spenser novel, but far from the best. My greatest disappointment: all of the drama of recovering from near death that was in the book where Spenser got shot was mostly absent from this one. I also agree with other reviews who say (a) the series is slowly declining in quality, (b) the publishes definitely stretch short novels with large type and book design to make bigger books and (c) enough Susan already."
3,Disappointed by the editing,"While others have expressed their disappointment in the formulaic writing, I find it disturbing that neither editor, proofreader, or author seemed to notice that Paul Giacomin (introduced in EARLY AUTUMN in 1981) has become Paul Giacomon. Is there a reason for this--other than sloppy don't-care editing?"
1,I give up,"I give up, I can't finish this book. Never got into it. Fortunetly I took it out of the library, so all I am is disappointed and not upset at wasting my money (only some of my time). Usually I like Robert B. Parker's books."
3,Cold Service (Spenser Novels),I enjoy audio books. He's a good writer and the reader is very good. A good escape for a winter's day..
3,Susan Silverman just shut up.,"I am a big fan of the Spenser series. The only parts of the books that bother me are the long conversations with Susan. This book has a double dose because of Hawk's girlfriend, Castile. She is even more annoying than Susan and the fact that Spenser has at length dialogs with both of them had me skipping pages. When Susan and Castile are talking to one another I almost lose it. Otherwise, the story is good. Considering Hawk's role in the past, it is interesting to see him calling the shots. Fans of Spenser-Hawk dialog will like this book. If you tire quickly of Susan Silverman this one may have you pulling your hair out."
4,SPENSER AND HAWK ON THE JOB,"The other reviewers have covered the story and some of the criticism about Hawk being ""dumbed down,"" often speaking in ghetto ebonics, and both he and Spenser on the tiresome racial banter back and forth. But you always know the good, satisfying outcome of these series, bad guys makes vicious mistakes and the two lads, along with some secondary characters, have to even the score and make things right again. It still shocks me when Hawk blasts the bad guys right between the eyes, even though they had it coming. No discussion, just very decisive action. It's not great literature but enjoyable entertainment for sure. I am going to miss my 1-3 Parker novels every year with Spenser and Hawk, and the new series of Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone. RIP Robert."
2,Not enjoyable,"I listened to the audio version of this. I thought the plot was boring and the dialog annoying. Wanted to quit several times (which I rarely do), and although I didn't, I know I wouldn't have missed any enjoyment if I had. Not at all a page turner to me. Although I liked Spencer's witty, terse dialog in other Spencer books, in this one it was mostly predictable or uninteresting. The constant ""He said"", and ""I said"" was irritating. I'd recommend passing on this one. There are so many better books to read that this one is not worth the time."
3,Cold Service,"I have read all of the Spenser novels but this series needs a major shake up. The near fatal shooting of Hawk, in Cold Service, felt like a beginning, but did anyone doubt for a second that he would fully recover? It gave the reader some rare insight into the Hawk character. It was also a refreshing change to see Spenser following Hawk's lead in this one. I hate to sound ""cold"" but somebody has got to go. I nominate Susan. That relationship has totally and completely run it's course. Killing Susan off would turn the whole series on it's ear. It would free up Spenser for all kinds of mischief and drama. Whaddya say Mr. Parker? At least think about it."
2,Recycled Spenser and Hawk,"I have read all of Robert Parker's Spenser books and have been a great fan of the character and Mr. Parker's way with conversation. But this latest adventure is tired, trite and recycled. As someone in another review said; the conversations between Hawk and Spenser and between Susan and Spenser have become tiring and repetitive. What was fresh and amusing and thoughtful has become worn and old.Ukrainians owning and controlling a town of 80,000 people. An Afghan warlord supplying heroin. FBI and CIA contributing to the mixture. Cold blooded, callous murder and too many references to friendship.The story line is convoluted and the denouement quite unbelievable.What I wouldn't give to see a book that had the excitement, perception and intelligence of his early works!!"
3,Not the strongest Parker,"This is not the strongest entry in this series. We learn a bit of Hawk and his background, and have the usual rehash of Spencer's relationship with Susan. The usual cast of characters is there, as well as the Grey Man, and the dialogue is as well-done as always. But, overall, there's just not much here."
2,SAME-SAME-SAME,"TYPICAL PARKER---IT'S ALL IN THERE---SAME OLD--SAME OLD---SAME OLD.BBBUUUTTT-----WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT READING A PARKER """"SPENSER"""" ???THEY ARE JUST FUN TO READ---FOR A BREAK---NOTHING SERIOUS---JUST FUN."
2,couldn't finish this one. don't care what happens,"Now I must admit that I'm not a big fan of the he-man black-white buddy-cop revenge and testosterone filled genre, but even so, this would not have even made the cut as a Law and Order episode. Clever dialogue??? ""Beer tastes better with a head on it"" what?? and all the recipies included? Gimme a break! It's like he was trying to make this book appealing to the ladies. Won't work, my friend. Anyway, I can guess what happens at the end ... Spenser somehow gets back at the ""Grey man"" for shooting him up, right? Anyway, I don't really care ... I think I need a good chick book right now to compensate for all the grunting in Cold Service."
3,"Tired series, fades at the end, and it's a shame...","Spenser, Susan and Hawk have been pals of mine for more than 20 years, but after so many books, there is nothing new to have them do. In this one, Hawk gets seriously wounded, and once he recovers, he takes awhile to get his revenge. I got this off the library shelf and read it in only a couple of hours, which I don't mind, but the promising start gives way to a disappointing finish. I think Mr. Parker is doing better with Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone, and might just leave Spenser to a safe retirement now. Parker has also published several ""stand alone"" books in the last few years, most of them worthwhile. I have loved him, and his style, and his characters, but I also loved Dick Francis for decades. Francis retired several years ago, and it was time. If you have read at least seven or eight Spenser novels, you know enough about the recurring characters to practically write this entry yourself."
2,ENOUGH WITH SUSAN!,"The ubiquitous metastasis of Susan throughout Parker's body of work bodes ill for Spenser fans. Not only is she now working out at the heretofore Susan-free Harbor Health Club, she's also giving Spenser and Hawk advice on how to catch bad guys...using her WORK (cue Hallelujia Chorus) to help them with their work. I suggest having Ty Bop shoot her in self-defense as she attempts to understand him to death."
1,Is Robert Parker Broke?,"How can you explain somone sacrificing a once great mystery franchise and his own reputation to make a few bucks with this literary swill?I fell in love with this series around 1990 with Catskill Eagle and immediately read everything to that point and since. The original plots were dynamic, the characters interesting and developed and I would stay up all because I flat couldn't put them down.This book is embarrasing, I'm not even convinced he actually wrote it, he may have handed it off to some unimaginative teenagers to cobble together a Spenser novel. OR maybe he had Popeye write it (original title ""I YAM WHAT I YAM!"").The dialogue with Susan is EXCRUCIATING & simplistic beyond words. And what's with the double spacing, 3 words to a line and 2 1/2 pages to a chapter? If this was typed out like a real novel, I think it would be about 25 pages!After 16 years I AM DONE! [...]"
3,Cold Service Left Me Cold,"It feels like Robert Parker phoned this one in. The dialogue is tired, the characters, although familiar and much loved, have become cliched. Susan is just annoying now. Even Pearl has lost her spark. I hope that this is the last of the Spenser mysteries. It doesn't have the energy or humor of previous books. My advice - don't bother buying it. If you really have to read it because you've read all the others, borrow it from someone. It's not worth the money."
3,I can't take it anymore!,"The best thing that could happen to this series would be if Susan Silverman caught a stray round in a drive by shooting and died and Pearl the wonder dog is put down with rabies. Must we continually read about how breath takingly beautiful Susan is and put up with their childish sexual banter? OK, they think each other is good in the sack, we get it. Give it a rest Mr. Parker, please. Having said that, this book gets three stars because Susan doesn't figure in it prominently. Less Susan allows more Hawk, which is a good thing."
1,That's it....I can't take it anymore,"This is absolutely the last Parker book for me. The first 24 Spenser novels were masterpieces, then things started to go down hill. It's clear that Parker has been on autopilot since then. This latest installment was disappointing, to say the least. If you're like me and really enjoyed the earlier Spenser books, try the Elvis Cole series by Robert Crais."
3,"""A man's got to do, what a man's got to do"" - ENOUGH.","Parker still has great lines (""Fortunately, I'm nationally ranked in both areas""), but he doesn't need to devote 4 or 5 chapters to irritating conversations between Spenser and Susan, as they delve into why Spenser is who he is. And why the Grey Man is who he is. And why there is the bond between Spenser and other people like him, like Quirk, but how Spenser is different from them, and how he is similar to Chollo, but not, and on and on and on.I can't stand Susan. She is the only person who is able to penetrate Hawk's personality?Just punch someone,cook a steak and shut up."
1,Enough,"If Parker can't produce the quality of the early part of the Spenser series, he should just end it. What has happened to the wonderfully caustic wit and dry humor? I have no idea why he continues to have Hawk speaking as though he just came from the cotton fields and not just for an occasional mocking ""sho nuff"" but every other line. I've purchased my last Parker book."
3,Good read,"I thought that this was a better-than-average installment among recent Spenser novels and it was refreshing that it was JUST a Spenser novel,its good to stick to the basics sometimes.A fast read that spencer fans will like, not love."
3,Not bad,"If you're an avid reader of the Spencer series, this is a must read simply for the fact that Hawk is turned into a mere mortal for a good part of the book. It's been pretty predictable that neither Spencer or Hawk EVER lose a fist or gun fight. Until now. Never mind Hawk is shot in the back - as he so aptly puts it: ""Not supposed to get shot"". Mortality, and age, is rearing it's ugly head at the 2 superheroes, and Parker is honest enough to deal with it."
3,A less than satisfying outing,"I am a huge Spenser/Robert Parker fan. I've read everything in the series and have enjoyed most of it immensely. That said, Cold Service is brief, freely uses large type and LOTS of white space in an attempt not to appear brief, and bases much of the story around a circular theme - Hawk is Hawk, can be nothing but Hawk, which makes him more Hawk, which drives him to do only the things Hawk would do, because he is Hawk, etc., etc, ad infinitum. The actual story is OK, but nowhere near the author's best efforts. I was left with the vague notion that what was said here has all been said before in the series' better books. All that said - glad I bought it, glad I read it, and I'll be buying the next one - while hoping for a richer read than this book provides. I know Parker can do better because he has done so on many previous occasions."
1,A Very Tired Entry in the Series,"I am a big fan of the Spenser novels, and have read every one, but this entry is dreadful. The conversations between Spenser and Susan, always annoying, are just retreads of every conversation they have ever had. And how many times can Spenser and Hawk have the same exact, word-for-word, shucking and jiving dialogue. We know Spenser is a honkie, and we know Hawk can speak both ghetto and condo. Can an author sue himself for plagiarism?There ia almost nothing to recommend this one, except that there are very few words per page, so you can finish it fast. I don't even think Robert B. Parker was interested. Maybe next time we can hae Spenser investigate a crime, or something."
3,What you see is what you get,This is one of the better later Spenser novels. Hawk is shot and critically wounded and Spenser helps him get revenge. I am going to skip my usual complaint about not enough character development and repetitve dialogue from other books and just say that it is what you would expect it to be if you are a fan of the series. Worth reading but no great shakes.
3,Contrived,"The Black English written for the character Hawk is amusing for the first 10 pages and then it becomes trite, irritating and a distraction. This apparent literary device to give Hawk a macho, putdown, cavilier image is highly contrived as revealed by lapses into grammatically correct prose from time to time. This ruse has been consistently used by author Parker in his Spencer novels. Give it up, R.B. Parker, it do stink."
2,Bored,I have been a big Parker fan for years but his Spenser books seem to get more and more boring. Good thing I bought this one used and didnt pay full price for it. The dialogue is so boring it is hard to finish it.
2,Not even close,"I couldn't agree more with the reviewer from Orange County. This latest Spenser novel is filled with the same old tired formula -- repeated cliches, predictable dialogue between Spenser and Hawk, Spenser and Susan, etc. I could almost guess what the forthcoming paragraph was going to read before I read it. Parker seems to take the short-cut on this effort, relying solely on his gift with conversational prose, but not delivering on the plot, characters, fresh ideas, and new sequences. Even his settings (i.e. North Shore, MA) are getting quite stale. I hate to say it, as I've been a fan from way back, but Cold Service reads like he wasn't even interested in his own story. It's not even close to his best and will probably be the last time I purchase a Spenser hardcover."
1,Missing Parts,"This over the door rack only has a few parts and two of the five parts were missing... Also, the list in the box was ripped and the box looked haggard."
3,Over the door rack,"I use this in my kitchen for my spices and herbs. It saves a lot of space on my pantry shelf. I can only use half of it because it interferes with my doornob. Also, it needs to be made in a more narrow style for doors that are less wide. It hangs over about 2 inches on my pantry door, but I figured a way to make it work."
1,disappointing package,"Can't say if it works or not........they neglected to send two connecting hangers for the door.........unimpressed...and indeed, wish I had looked at earlier reviews........it is not a 5 foot rack.......it is two, 2 1/2 foot racks with a loose connecting link.........definitely a work-around......don't buy this poorly designed equipment...I would return it, but due to the oversize box, it will cost me more to return than to purchase..........lesson learned.........this seller does not get a 1 star.........they get a solid 0. This review is critical of both the product and the distributor...........not what I was expecting..........!"
3,It's okay,Not two bad but it seems very cheap and flimsy. They seem like they will hold up but could get bent easy.
1,Review for 5ft over door basket rack,"The rack is a good idea considering most pantry doors nowadays aren't real wood so I bought this one since I wouldn't have to screw it into the door. However, it's poorly executed. It is so flimsy I wouldn't want to put more weight on it then spice packets or small spice jars. I bought it to help make room for boxed items (mac n cheese, instant potatoes, etc) and it's too flimsy to use for that purpose, forget about tyring to put canned goods on it.I am returning it. Please listen to the other reviewers who told you to steer clear, I know the price makes it tempting, but don't waste your time, you'll just end up returning it."
2,Not good,"I ordered this rack for the back of my bathroom door, but it ended up sitting in my garage now.First,the quality of the material that this rack is made of is poor. It's that thin, light, metal thing covered in white paint, which you see mostly in hardware store. I don't even have a fancy bathroom. Most of my bathroom stuff are from Target, but this rack still doesn't look good in my bathroom.Second, as one reviewer pointed out, unless you are willing to drill several holes and put in screws in your door, this rack won't stay and will swing when you open the door each time. The worst part is that things will fall off from the back of this rack when it swings away from the door. Particularly because the rack itself is not heavy, when you put on something slightly heavier, it easily falls off.It does give lots of storage place, but I would only use it for garage or storage spaces where I don't care of the look and can fasten the rack onto the wall."
3,Minor Adjustments to Fit DVDs,"This rack is not quite sized properly for DVDs which is what i was originally lookiing for. There are 2 of the racks which does not fit DVDs at all due to a stablizer bar across the back of the rack. I had to use tape in order to hold the rack close enough to the wall where the DVDs did not slip out from behind (since the rack has no backing) but where the DVDs will fit. For the other 2 racks VHS tapes fit perfectly. This product still works as designed adn gets the job done, but it is not made for every item."
1,Unstable!,"I got this for the kitchen closet but it doesn't take the heavy stuff. The instructions say you should attach it to the door with the bolt it comes with, but I dont think it would work in the door... =/Anyway ... I dont get the good reviews.."
1,Dissatisfied customer,"This is a very flimsy over the door rack. It only holds 5 lbs per shelf. I want to return it but could not find this item on Amazon.com. I will try again. Not even sure where to return it - back to you or the address on the box. This is totally not want I am looking for and definitely do not want to keep it. Just want to return it and get my money back. If I cannot return this item and get my full refund, I won't be purchasing anything else from Amazon.com."
3,5 foot storage basket,The top bar of each section should be stronger. I found that when I got canned goods loaded they both bent. I would have liked a back bar on each shelf to keep the cans from sliding part way off the back of each shelf.
1,WORTHLESS,"I purchased this to hang off my bathroom door. I thought I could store all the shampoos, conditioners, lotions, and other knick knacks that were taking up my counter space. This thing is so shakey and the shelves are so wide, the wires so spread apart that the only thing I can store on this is toilet paper. I hate this item, and every day when I go to my bathroom, this is a constant reminder of the money i wasted. The nails to ""secure"" the shelf to the door suck as well!"
3,Dana,When storage shelf arrived it was missing one of the self hangers. Not aswell made as hoped for. Fits nicely over my door.
4,"great product, great space saver",Bought this item when we moved and had to downgrade to a smaller kitchen. It is quite the space saver! Am very pleased with product and would recommend it to anyone.
3,Overall - Ok,"I received this product quickly and was very pleased. There is nothing wrong with the ordering/shipping of this product.A few things that I am disappointed in:1) There were no instructions that came with the assembly. Granted, there were only two parts, but I also received screws. I did not know if I needed to use the screws. For how I used the product, I did not screw the device into the door.2) I used this product to store VHS tapes (about 80) on the back of a door. Perhaps because I did not use screws or maybe I have exceeded the weight capacity this device can bear, but I am starting to see buckling and bending of the over the door hangar (clip) part.3) Perhaps because I did not use the screws, but the device when hanging can be a bit unstable.Overall, the product has not fallen down yet, but I think for what I wanted to use the device for, it just cannot bear that much weight."
3,Useful but needs support,"My wife and I were looking for an inexpensive way to add some extra space to our pantry closet. We wanted something that would hold boxes of side dishes (Mac/cheese, rice mixes, mashed potatos..). I was on business travel when it arrived and my wife installed it with no problems. When I got home two days later and looked at it, the shelves had sagged a bit under the weight of the stuff on them. I added a couple more screws to the door to support the middle of the shelves and it has been working great."
4,space creater,this purchase has created more space in my pantry closet. by hangng on the door it is completely out of the way and stores additional foods for me.
3,OK for what it is,"I read the reviews and knew it may flop around on the door a bit, but it really does not stay put. It's okay for what it is, but not something I would buy again. It works better if you seperate the two racks and use them on different doors as opposed to connected together."
1,Wish I would have read all of the reviews!,"The description mentioned that it could be used to store cans. Had I read the reviews I would have known that this was not the case. Five cans were enough to bring the whole thing down. The design is horrible for storing pantry items that have any weight. I think the description is misleading and should be revised.Rather than screw holes to affix it to a door, the wire has a bend in it which is supposed to hold the shelf, but as soon as you put something on the shelf, it pops off the screws and starting swinging. For twice the price, I will go back and buy one that is sturdy and secure.At the price for the product and the cost for return shipping, it isn't worth the bother to try to send it back, so we are going to try to find a way to modify it and attach it to the walls in our pantry. Hopefully we will find a way to use it."
3,Kinda skimpy,This wire rack is not as heavy duty as the ones I see in the stores. Easy to bend etc... I don't know how it will hold up. It's doing the job for now.
1,Horrible! Needs contant readjustment and stuff falls all the time!,"The title says it all. The shelf slides all over the hooks at the top and all the stuff falls out. There is a good 4 inch gap at some spots so stuff falls begind the shelf. Poorly designed and a waste of money. I guess if you want to damage your door by nailing it into place to make it stay put, it would probably be ok but I as rent, I can't do that."
4,nice rack,"the over the door hooks are a little cheap. Unless you are planning to permanently attach to a door (this is what I did), don't bother. Once I attached to the door, it's fine. Just hanging on the door, it's worthless."
3,Decent storage basket,"This storage basket did a lot to improve storage in a small closet of mine. The kit included screws to fix the basket to the door, which works pretty well. These baskets aren't designed to hold a lot of weight. I had to be sure to avoid putting heavy items in them (such as canned goods) because the baskets quickly begin to sag."
1,Over the Door Pantry Rack,"I am TOTALLY dissatisfied with this product!! It looks good in the picture but when you get it you start to wonder about your purchase. At least I did. The rack isn't very sturdy. I hung it on the back of my pantry door and put some canned goods along with some boxed items on the rack. Just a couple of days afterwards when I decided to rearrange the order in which I had my items on the rack, the ""hook"" part that fits over the door almost completely straightened out and the whole rack almost hit the floor. It would have had I not been right there to catch it and then the couple of small jar items would have broken when it hit the floor.I do not recommend this rack to anyone who really wants extra storage area for your grocery items. Spend more and get a better quality rack that WILL hold your items."
1,storage dynamics rack,"as soon as i opened this package i knew i was in trouble. this product is very lightweight and as soon as i started putting items in it, the top bowed and now doesnt straighten out. it can't hold any weight for 5 ft. it doesnt feel like vinyl covered steel. so now its in the garbage and i'm still looking for an over the door rack."
3,For lightweight items only,I've only used one section to this rack although I'm sure I can find a use for the other section.I did not hang this on the door but rather on a wall and I'm not sure the bracket is strong enough for a door. I needed the extra storage space until the kitchen is remodeled so this seemed like the way to go.This rack is flimsier than I anticipated which limits its use. It is better for lightweight items than the heavier bottles and such that I wanted at my fingertips with a special diet needs person for whom to cook. I noticed a few days ago that it had developed a sag. It hangs next to an older smaller rack which is much sturdier and originally held many of the items now on the new rack...sans sag.It did arrive promptly with all of its parts and pieces.
4,"Great product, stores a lot, mounting is so-so","I ordered two of these racks, one for food storage on the inside of my pantry door and one for storing paints and supplies in an art studio. I looked at a bunch of more expensive racks, and for the price these vinyl covered parts are quite nice looking and durable. The only downside I can see is the weak mounting points, just two hooks on the top section, two hooks on the bottom, and ""dimples"" of bent round bar to anchor screws inside...when installing screws these little screw notches don't allow a screw with washer to fit evenly across the bar, so they tend to wiggle and move around. I would have preferred some simple mounting tabs in these locations instead of these notches; however, overall this is a nice product for the price if properly installed."
3,OK,I like this item because it allows me to have extra storage in my small pantry. I can also just hang it on the door so I don't have to poke holes all over my wall/door. The only thing I dislike about the product is that it wobbles. When you open and close the door you basically bang it against the door because it's only secure at the top. It also doesn't hold that much weight. Other than that it's pretty useful for what I use it for.
3,Racks and more racks,"These racks are very flimsy, unfortunately. Try to put VHS tapes on any of the shelves or a box of crackers and you are begging for trouble. Forget putting any canned goods on the shelves which is why I originally wanted these. Had I known this would be the case, I wouldn't have ordered them but the price is about what you'd pay. I've had similar racks in the past that were not as skimpy. One must make sure the holders over the door are completely aligned or the whole thing bows downward from any weight."
2,Flimsy,"This was a hard to find product in stores like Walmart, KMart, Target..found it at Amazon and was very pleased...received rack immediately and was happy for that but it is rather flimsy...the wire rack is okay for price but expected a more substantial stronger rack. It's the old ""get what you pay for"" experience."
5,Does exactly what I need,"Is it the most sturdy thing in the world? Nope. But it does exactly what I need.I use this on a door I never/rarely open (the door to the AC/heating unit) and all I need to store on it are my dog's medicines and supplies.No issues.Do I think it'd support cans? Doubtful, at least not many.Is it super steady? Not really, but for me it doesn't matter."
1,Piece of crap,"This is a total piece of crap. It's really cheap, just some thin wires, and sways a lot. Also, the side eats into the measurement so even though it says 19 inches wide, there is only less than 16 inches of actual shelf space, a really poor design concept. I also bought the Grayline 410324, Large 6 Shelf Storage System, in the same order and that one is significantly superior in quality I'm surprised people actually bought this and kept it. I do not recommend anyone to buy it."
1,"Video storage, the reason it is cheap... it is built CHEAP!","Not happy at all with this product. All of my VHS videos are mostly Disney videos that are packaged in the bigger plastic case... and this product will not hold ANY of my videos!! :( Also, in the pic it looks like it is one unit but it's not. It's two units that connect with these cheap little hooks.. and they slide all around! Super bummed. If you have all vhs videos in the cardboard sleeves it may work if you just use the top half... but too heavy to use both pieces."
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought this product to use as additional storage space in my tiny apartment. It did come with screws and hooks. I opted to use the hooks only. It was not designed to hold can goods, flour, sugar, or anything that is heavy. I had hoped to store my rice and staples on it, but within 2 weeks of purchase, the top had warped and bent under the weight of the products placed. I believe that if you were to bold it in, it may work better, but I specifically bought it for the over the door purpose. I am now only using the top half of the rack and for items that do not weigh more than a roll of toilet paper."
4,a bargain! works great if mounted to the door,"This shelving system is a great solution for a pantry door for food storage, etc. I purchased it for holding cleaning supplies on the back of my basement door. When it just hangs from the top of the door, it is not very sturdy - the weight of items on the shelves must be perfectly balanced (or else it hangs crooked), and it kind of moves when you open the door. But once you screw it to the door (there are six holes for screws), it is very solid. The shelves are tall enough for tall spray bottles (like Windex, etc.). I looked for one of these for a while and this is by far the lowest-priced option out there."
1,Junk,"Any seller who markets this item should be ashamed. Worthless, flimsy piece of junk, fit only for lightest weight items such as ziplock bags, and then only IF you find a way to secure it to the door so that it doesn't flop all over the place when you open and close the door. I wanted this item as extra storage for for canned goods; but it bends & flexes under the weight of even one or two heavier items. Too much bother and expense to send it back. I definitely feel ""had."""
1,Could be better,Was hoping this would help to make more room in the pantry and it does with lighter items that can go on the rack. The wire racks are thin and bend easily. Heavier products will bend the wire and mounting the rack on the bottom so it doesnt swing when the door opens and closes is poorly designed.
1,Swinging Rack,"My mother-in-law has an over the door rack that is so nice. I was hoping this would do the trick like hers to get my many big spice jars out of our tiny cupboard. Wrong idea!The over the door hooks are too large for my newer interior doors. The design of the hooks that attach the two rack pieces together is stupid because it just makes the racks stick out. It comes with screws to secure it to the door, but as a renter, that is why I sought an over the door rack- so I wouldn't put any holes in the door! If I could put holes in the door, I would have gotten the permanent mounted racks, not some swinging piece of junk!The shelves are rated for 5 pounds each. With all my big spice jars from the shopping club, the wires are rounding a bit in places. Also, the wires are too far apart for the small spice jars, as they keep tipping over.Poor quality and poor design. This one may be going back!"
3,"disappointing quality, but still does the trick","I bought this despite other reviews talking about quality and design, but I never planned to hang it over the door, so I didn't think it would matter. I have this screwed directly into the back of our pantry door for extra storage and although it serves its purpose, the $23 price tag is way too much for its quality. The wire gauge on this item is mediocre at best - the shelves came slightly bent and warped, which isn't surprising given the wire gauge. Some of the wires are comparable to the thickness of spaghetti - not very sturdy or resilient.If the item was below $15, I'd have been more forgiving, but for the current price tag of above twenty dollars, it's just not worth it if you can find something comparable elsewhere. I had trouble finding this simple item anywhere else, so I settled for this one."
1,flimsy piece of junk - only suitable for VERY lightweight items,"Junk. Save your money. I tried putting small bottles and jars on a couple of shelves, and they immediately started to bend - and the hooks that go over over the door bent so badly they almost straightened, so the whole rack almost fell off the door. This useless product is made of extremely weak and flimsy metal (tin?) that will not hold anything besides a box of teabags and some ziploc bags. Home Depot has a much stronger version for $30!"
3,You get what you pay for,"I needed extra space for videos and DVDs and didn't want to spend a high amount of money for what local stores offered. This seemed like the a cheap, easy solution. It is what it is pictured to be, a cheap metal rack that hangs on a door. It only holds VCR tapes in the cardboard sleeves and still lays flat against the door. If you put in DVD cases or the hard plastic VCR tape cases it causes it to stick out more. Still for the money, it serves it's purpose. It also rattles against the door if you move the door. If you want something perfect, you have to pay more."
1,Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this hanging self. Very flimsy, bendable, and does not hold its shape. I would be afraid to hang it on the door for fear it would not hold. I mistakenly threw the receipt away otherwise I would return it. Not sure what I am going to do with it."
1,Over-door 5'foot rack,Bought this product to use in kitchen for a pantry. Arrived bent in many places but was easily straighten. Should have been a hint as to its suitability for holding canned products. Installed on door. Its only suitable for very lightweight items because it buckles when canned goods are placed on it.
2,not very stable; expensive for what it is,"First of all, I mis-measured, so this turned out to be too wide for the hall closet, where I intended to use it. Plan B was the bedroom closet, where it fits fine. However, as other reviewers have noted, this unit swings and bangs against the door when you open it. You could, of course, screw it to the door, if you wanted to damage the door. Better would be if there were some kind of extension that would allow you to hook it under the door as well as over the top of the door. Because this is a 2-piece unit, it is particularly unstable where they connect. Putting anything heavy on the shelves makes the unit more unstable. Perhaps the best use is for such things as rolled up T-shirts and other lightweight items. Small things, though, would fall through the mesh. For most applications, an over-the-door unit with plastic pockets (such as for inserting shoes) would work better and be much cheaper than this."
3,over door rack,It is a good product however there is a 5 pound weight limit on the shelves which makes it unsuitable for can goods or anything else that is weighty
2,Not Univeral Enough,"The hooks at the top are to large, they are designed for at least a 3 inch thick door they extend at least 1 inch from the outside of our door when it is shut. The rack includes additional screws for support, but the screws heads are to small, I had to go to the local store and purchase washers. After all said and done, it is not the best out there I'm sure, but finally we have it up and it is holding our stuff."
3,"Good idea, poorly executed","Got this for my little Teen Titans fan. The concept behind the toy isn't bad, little video game in a communicator. You can collect the codes on cards that come with the other 2006 Teen Titans toys and enter them to battle new villains, gain buddies and weapons. The two mini games are quite fun as well.Unfortunately the shaking bit has got to go. To get Robin to walk from place to place and to get a buddy to join you in battle you have to shake the toy. it feels like the same kind of motion sensor in a pedometer. You have to shake it pretty hard and the toy already seems to be behaving flakily 6 hours after we took it out of the package. We have also yet to have a successful shake to have a buddy join us, we either seem to shake it too much or too little for it to be successful.We will try and replace the battery, but it doesn't seem like a very durable toy."
3,My review on the Cooper County book,I liked the book because it contained imformation of the county dating clear back to the start of it. I especially liked the parts concerning the railroad which later turned into the Katy Trail. I was fasinated by the accounts of what people did and had to go through during the Great depression. I am excited about what the county has developed into today.
5,Christmas Shoes,"Great Album.The whole point of the cd is to remind us what Christmas is all about. Giving, being compassionate, putting other people first. Wanting to make a good impression to Jesus(from this little boys perspective). Great song/cd."
3,Ruin the Christmas Mood,"Last year, I was listening to the radio, making christmas cookies and enjoying the season. All the sudden, ""Christmas Shoes"" (which is on this album) started to play. It completely put me out of the happy mood I was in.It is about a little boy buying a pair of shoes that his mom wished for. The mother is very sick, and is probably going to die on Christmas. The chorus goes:""Sir I want to buy these shoes, for my momma please. [...] I want her to look beautiful, if mommy meets Jesus tonight.""Personally, I jump to try to turn this song off every time it goes on the radio since its so depressing. I can't comment to the rest of the album, but that song alone makes me steer clear."
3,CAUTION,"NOTE: This is NOT a LARGE PRINT book. It is a good cookbook, but is mislabelled; the typeface is no larger than ordinary books."
3,Think of cyberpunk,"See the movie first,the get the CD. Those faint of heart shouldn't do either,but those few daring souls who like it,CD and movie, should run,not walk to the nearest Media Play and grab this CD and movie when it comes out on video. Fanstastic!"
2,That is called music?,"Although I was reminded of the hot Keanu when I listen to the CD, the talent did not seem to be there for some of the artists that were included in the soundtrack."
4,THIS CD IS COOL,"I couldn't think of anyhting else for my title, so sue me. I think this CD has some really sweet songs but I was a little dissapointed that half the songs didn't have words in them, oh well, the beats are pretty dark and match the movie theme. My favorite songs were: ""Rock is Dead"" (the only Marilyn Manson song worth listening to) ""My Own Summer"" ""Mind Fields"" ""Clubbed to death"" ""Du Hast"" and ""Wake Up."""
3,Good brain with cheap skull,"I've been using my Master 5 for the last four years. It's very handy and functions well EXCEPT I've been using it with a rubber band. I don't remember if I dropped it or not, but the little plastic peg broke off from the hinge to the cover. I do want to keep it covered when I'm not using it, so I secure the cover with a rubber band. It's just too delicatedly made for a calculator that is made for 'construction purpose.' Of course when I'm using it, the cover is totally separated from its body, and it becomes an extra 'piece' on my busy architect's desk."
5,Get this calculator,This is the perfect calculator for anyone who needs to calculate feet and inches or metric and you can calculate length and angles without trig. It replaced 3 calculators.
5,Give this one five meows!,"Got this book several years ago, and it is really very sweet.Anyone who thinks cats don't have emotions, or that they are coldfish, needs to see this book. Full of charming examples of felines and their companions (animal and human), nuzzling up to-gether, sharing a moment of friendship and love. The cover aloneis worth the price of the book.Guaranteed to charm, this little book is well-worth purchasing."
5,One of THE Best on this Topic,"I am delighted to see that this book is still available. My copy is so dog eared and worn from its multiple readings that I need a fresh copy. I am also delighted that I can now tell others where they can purchase this classic.I have read almost every book that has been published on this topic, and this is head and shoulders above most of them. It contains practical examples and illustrations, and cuts across all economic strata.I highly recommend this to anyone seeking to know God's plan for the workplace and the employees in it."
5,NEVER FEAR,"This is the best book I have ever read on the workplace. This book will help you relate Biblical truths about Nehemiah, the ""Contractor"", and Joseph, the ""Government Offical"", to your day-to-day work experience. This book affirms why you should place your confidence in God at work and discusses His purposes and your relationship with peers, employers, and customers in a way that will totally change the way you approach your job. It is a fast and compelling MUST READ."
2,"Entertaining, but ...","There are ethics and there are Ethics. I'm reminded clearly in this work that ""rendering unto Ceasar the things that are Ceasar's, and on to God the things that are God's"" is sound biblical advice especially in the workplace. This tome does not separate the work place from the belief space: ethics [adequately enumerated by The Commandments] are key, while Ethics [encomassing blind allegiance to an earthly rendition of a Christain God] may fall a bit flat. Faith, yes; allegiance, no... would the Ethic allow ethical business with one of another faith? Anybody need some used bookshelf clutter?"
3,good cd but not there best,"When i first saw that saigon kick had a new release out I immediantly picked it up. Being along time fan I love all there work ,but this one left alittle to be desired. theres not enough guitar on this cd for me. It's kind of like water without all the guitars. If your a new fan check out devil inthe details or the lizard first then pick this one up. If your a old fan pick it up anyway it's still a very good album musiclly."
1,"sorry guy's,try again!!!","I've been waiting for this album for about 4 years and to say the least it's nothing more than a total disapointment!!!If you liked Devil in the Details,and water the chances of you enjoying this album are very,very slim.I can only hope that the next SK cd makes up for this mindless garbage.some of the songs are: CONSCIENCE,BIG SHOT(my personal fav),NEARER,SO SAD TO SAY,and SIGN OF THE TIMES. Jason's other band Super Transatlantic has a cd coming out any time called ""Shuttlecock"".This cd will not let you down.as far as bastards is concerned,it's better off on a shelf collecting dust!"
3,"If This Is It, Then That's Fine I Guess","I've tried to like/love this CD for years, and aside from a few bright spots...to me it just sounds like a Jason Bieler solo record or something, it's thin in many places and for the most part doesn't feature many key members. I remember liking the last song ""Nearer"" after the first listen and with it's inclusion really it just makes the album as a whole sound like there's only one good song after you hear it. I still think it's one of their best songs, and surprise!...Phil and Chris play on this one track. So there ya go, the album definitely has a different tone on just about every instrument it seems, drums and guitar are flat for the most part, not as tribal and heavy at all. I guess if this is the best ""they"" could do under the name, then it was time to call it quits after this.Favs are of course ""Nearer"", ""So Sad To Say"" (nice ballad), ""Sign Of The Times"", ""Solitary Jerk"" , and ""We Never Met""."
2,A decent hockey story ruined.,It's a film that many Canadian's can relate to. It's a story about three hockey fanatic brothers and a controlling mother.I don't wanna waste too much time on this film. I'm gonna keep it short. The acting in this film is quite good most of the time. The story is good enough to keep you interested. The problem with this film is the poor direction and photography. It seems like these guys only had one lens with one focal length. All of the hockey action in this film is ruined by poor camerawork and a lack of imagination. It's like they shot the hockey scenes in a rush cause they couldn't afford more rink time or something. It completely ruined what could have been a great indie flick. Half assed.If you're gonna make a film about a sport it might come in handy to know a bit about sports photography.If the camerawork wasn't so crappy I would have given this one 4 stars.
2,Left a bad taste in my mouth,"I LOVED ""Expecting Adam"" by the same author and eagerly anticipated reading this book once I heard about it. I was disappointed. Perhaps I'm losing my sense of humor, at least when it comes to religion, but I thought her tone was overly flippant at times and I found it jarring. Assuming she's telling the truth -- and that's a huge assumption -- I feel badly for the author, but if her goal was to help convert her people, I think this book will not help in that effort. No faithful Mormon is going to be convinced -- will in fact be repelled. As an apologetical book it fails. It isn't much more than a tell-all in the tradition of Deborah Laake."
1,one sided,"Its amazing to me what people consider to be truth, and honesty. You have a very one sided view of one persons perspective, and somehow many people consider it truth and honesty. This woman has created her world with her words and fully believes it to be true, but then she can only see her world with her eyes. In my experience truth is subject to interpretation. It is not an absolute. And I have also found that my words create worlds, create realities for me, and that my memories can be twisted by my words - that ANYONE'S memory can be twisted by words. Beware of anyone who is professing to give you the absolute truth, and just know that if they say to you this is the truth that is just might not be."
3,Torn about this book,"I am so conflicted on this book. I truly can't decide if I believe Martha's father actually did molest her, or not. (Only she knows, not any of the strangers reviewing this book. Even her siblings wouldn't be able to verify whether the father molested her.)However, the real reason I picked up this book was to learn some more about the LDS church, and learning about Smith's ""translation"" of the Egyptian text, not to mention his supposed receiving of the golden plates, and other things Mormons espouse was worth the time spent reading this. That being said, her New-Agey spirituality does get annoying at times. So if like me you're curious about the Mormons, read this book!"
4,A riveting read,"Having always had somewhat of a dissident spirit, but knowing better than to ask questions (""put it on the shelf""), I looked forward to reading this book. It's very popular in the SLC library system! I found many things to chuckle about, many things to be angry about, and many things to ponder. I would like to read a continuation of her experiences, I have to admit I'm curious as to how/why she ended up with a woman life partner so soon after her family moved to Phoenix and after all she and her husband went through."
5,"Gripping, informative, entertaining, fascinating","I already knew a little of Mormon history and culture--the Egyptian papyrus scam, for instance, and the Mountain Meadows massacre--but I didn't realize the iron control and stultifying environment within communities controlled by the Mormon church. Truly eye-opening to read the daily details of a religious totalitarian society in operation. Martha Beck is courageous as well as perceptive. Highly recommended."
5,A thought-provoking read,"I first met Martha Beck through her columns in Oprah magazine, and they were so wise, true, and funny that I searched out other things she might have written. I have read all her other books (am finishing up The Joy Diet now) and I find her voice true and fearless. Some parts of this are tough to take, but with its overall message of the importance of spirituality and forgiving, this is a book worth reading, not just by those who are interested in the Church of the Latter Day Saints, but by those interested in reading about one woman's pursuit of her spirituality. I highly recommend this book."
2,"Had high hopes, but they were dashed","I had hoped that Beck would lay out a sound argument for leaving the church and build the credibility to shore up her abuse claims. I was disappointed to read that she did neither. I have left the LDS church, so you would think I'd welcome this book, but I found it to be flimsy and stereotypical for both the people of Utah and New England- both are dear to my heart. I've experienced some bizzare episodes while living in Utah, but none of them are the ""beyond reality"" episodes Beck describes. While I enjoy her narrative style and can relate to SOME of the cultural references and experiences, the book spun out of control and cast a bad light on those of us who have left the church for justifiable reasons- yes, there are some! I really questioned her academic abilities after reading this book. Instead of dealing the LDS church a blow, she hit those of us who have left."
1,Read John Beck's review...,"Hi, I just wanted everyone to see that John Beck, Martha's former husband wrote a review. It is being established that there are lots of inconsistencies in this book that point to Martha's character. I think the book whether you like it or not is good writing. Good fictional writing! This is her experience though but people look at all of the inconsistencies and stretches of truth."
5,"Excellent Book From An ""Insider's"" Point Of View","I am an active member of the Mormon Church, come from good old pioneer stock, was married in the temple and my Father is a former Bishop and Stake President.I absolutely LOVED this book. I grew up in Provo and Martha Beck has older siblings who were my age. How she described living in Utah, getting married in the temple and other aspects of being a Mormon couldn't be more accurate.I have also read much about SRA (satanic ritual abuse) and what Beck described in her book is identical to many other victim's memories who grew up in the Catholic Church, Jehovah's Witnesses and other religions.I have read John Beck's review and find it to be extremely bitter, distasteful and misleading. Martha is very kind, gracious, and complimentary to him and his parents in the book. Someone in the church (along with someone in the Nibley family) must have gotten to him. His review must have hurt Martha a great deal which I'm sure was John's intent."
1,A Suggestion...,"I would recommend taking this book and the reviews written about it with a ""grain of salt"", so to speak. If you really want to know the ""truth"" about the Mormon faith,it would be more affective to gather views from those who really live and believe the church's (not a cult, by the way...do some SCHOLARLY research on it)teachings. I give Beck credit for not blindly accepting beliefs, but I would remind anyone interested in reading this book that Beck has had several emotional disturbances and therefore may not be the most accurate authority on the church's teachings. I regret she has had to deal with such horrible abuse. That kind of thing is NOT what Mormons believe in. For more information on the church's actual doctrine, [...]"
1,Kinda Goofy,"It's kind of goofy that non-mormons - especially obviously anti-mormons - absolutely loved this book almost without exception. And yet most LDS reviewers pretty much hated it. As a member of the Church, I have no interest in reading this book, but I just wanted to point out how little help I am getting as to the ""quality"" of this book from other reviews...there is clearly a LOT of bias..."
1,not believable,"Well-written perhaps, but that's the best I can say about this book. I don't believe Martha's account of the sexual abuse from her father. I wanted to... but there were too many inconsistencies, too much seemed like fabrication. I do believe that Martha believes that what she wrote is true, but that doesn't make it true. Instead of sympathizing with her, I felt annoyed and sorry that I had spent money on this book. I couldn't get it out my house fast enough."
1,Boring book,"This book was very boring from the beginning. Talked mainly about her health problems, very little about the Mormon faith. NO details at all.I would suggest the book, ""Out of Mormonism"" by: Judy Robertson. X-cellent read!!! Keeps you turning the pages!"
3,Depends on what you want,"you know its a funny thing with a book like this. those of you who are for the Mormon church read such a book and strain at the littlest error because the book under cuts the Mormon Church and makes some unflattering comments about Mormon people in general. On the flip side Those of you who are against the Mormon Church will accept any story no matter how ridicules so long as it DOES undercut the Mormon church. Ether way both group's special interest make them blind. Personaly I found the book slightly dull and some of the stories hard to believe, Though I do believe that the accusation against her father for sexual abuse certainly sounds true and most defiantly should be investigated. Ether way, the book isn't a great read, but you could do worse.... or a lot better.P.S Give Her EX. a break, there are a lot more effective ways to undercut this book [...]"
2,Interesting...,"This was an interesting book to read, but one is left with the distinct impression that the author ends up in a place where anything and everything is ok (spiritually) and yet claims to be a Christian. To be a ""Christian"" means to be a follower of Christ, to live by the Bible, and to live a life reflecting Jesus. Where this woman ends up (in her book) is not at that place, so while she left Mormonism, she did not really find ""Christianity""....yet :)"
1,Puzzled...,"I must be living in a rare ""liberated"" section of Provo/Orem, Utah. In my almost 30 years here I have never had to get permission to have my hair cut short, I have always worn sandals without socks or hose and I never realized the hair on my legs was an extension of(gasp)pubic hair. Some of the very same public censure Ms. Beck talks of, is the same I experienced growing up in a conservative small Texas town. I don't think it is all entirely religion specific. I was a transfer student sent to BYU by parents hoping to tame their wayward daughter.I wanted to give this book a fair chance. What I came away with is a growing sense of dismay, and not because of what Ms. Beck details. Rather, I began to sense a person so determined to support her claims she is willing to turn away from that she claims is her only purpose....truth. I felt as though I was reading a well crafted piece of fiction."
4,A Woman's Struggle to Find Her Truth,"I have read this book twice and found it even better the second time around when I was more interested in the context and the ideas than in the story. It is a very compelling story, told by the brilliant Martha Beck. Her educational credentials and reasonable voice add punch to a horrifying story of abuse, personally and systemically, by her father and by the LDS corporation. I highly recommend this book to women who have left the Mormon church or are considering it, to women who have been abused in their families, to any woman who is struggling with challenges of faith and creating her own identity."
2,It's the Same Old Song on a New Background.,http://www.fairlds.org/Reviews/Rvw200504.htmlCouldn't say it better
1,Pure Bunk - Remembered horrific things at the psychiatrist?,The idea of surpressed memories that surface one day in psychiatrists office have been proven by medical journals to be false. This book is based entirely on bunk. The talk show host Dr. Laura will tell her callers there is no such thing as supressed memories. I feel sorry for Martha Beck and that she is futilely attempting to slander her great father that has died. This is a work of fiction.
