3,Type Y Vacuum Bags Microfiltration with Closure - 9 Pack,"Basic item replacement that has nothing outstanding about it. Careful when ordering and price comparing because the company I ordered from did not give a discount for multiple packs, i.e. S&H was added for each pack. Thought I'd stockpile to save a few bucks but all I did was use my storage space."
5,good vaccum,"i was looking for a vaccum for very long time, then my friend suggested me this vaccum and i read its reviews on amazon...most of the ppl were satisfied with the product and i wanted something reasonable then i thot of giving it a try... m very happy with this product as its worth the price.. m using it for last 6 months and its doing its job preety well... if u r looking for first vaccum give it a try u wont b disappointed.."
5,Hoover Windtunnel type Y microfiltration vacuum bags,"I ordered these vacuum bags to go with my remanufactured vacuum. The price is great and I received them within days of ordering. They work teriffic. I 5 star them. Will order again.Jackie Guedry, Louisiana"
3,Work just fine!,"No problems to report...can't really get too excited about the bags...love the vacuum though, thank you! I like the fact that we can get them pretty cheap."
4,Economical,"The price of this 9 pack is very low compared to other options. It's very economical, easy to install and remove."
1,PureJunk,"The Simplicity Type Y replacement bags for the Hoover Windtunnel Upright caused the Vac to overheat, tripping the vacs thermal protection switch, in less than 30 minutes with almost NOTHING in the bag. Re-tried with another new Simplicity bag after cool-down. Exactly the same performance. Changed back to Hoover Type Y bags and the 15 year old vac runs the same as it did the day it was purchased. Simplicity is absolute JUNK. Don't waste your money. Yes, the Hoover bags are expensive but the Simplicity bags are a total waste. We vac every two weeks and the Hoover bags last 8 weeks while the Simplicity bags don't make it thru a quarter of ONE CLEANING!!!"
3,Amazon Price Discrepancy,This item is listed here for $6.00...Until you place it in your Shopping Cart. Then it becomes $1.00 more. Beware.
4,Hoover WindTunnel Upright Type Y Vacuum Bags Microfiltration with Closure,"The bags are fine as far as functionality. With allergies and asthma, I must use bags that address this. My only gripe is that they are 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the Type A bags my previous vacuum took, and so I'm changing them far more often than with the previous vacuum and bags."
2,Hoover type Y vacuum bags,"The bags are about 3 inches too long for the vacuum we have.Folded they work, but not as efficiently, I am sure becausethe air must exit double or quadruple layers of bag."
1,Really Not A Cookbook,"I am very disappointed with this book. Practically every recipe in it calls for preprepared/processed items (pre-pak mixes, cans of condensed soup, seasoning mixes, frozen veggies, Butter Buds, etc.).To me, this is not about cooking. I do realize the point of having a slow cooker is to have convenience and ease, but a few minutes of preparation using whole foods and one's own spices and ingredients at least provides for some of the satisfaction of cooking a meal. A slow cooker is truly fab when one takes a few minutes to prepare what is going to be cooked as opposed to just dumping in a few pre-pak items. I for one, do not find it rewarding to take so many shortcuts. I am sure this book is wonderful for many, but not for those who truly enjoy cooking!"
4,easy recipes,"I really like the unique recipes in this book, and the fact that they don't call for many ingredients. It's easy for me to grab the book on the way to the grocery store and figure out a meal while I'm at the store."
1,Busy People should eat better than this!,"I own a lot of cookbooks and have honestly never purchased a more ridiculous book. Seven ingredients or less, yes - it's easy when you're using canned soup, prepared chili or bottled marinade. The recipes feature a lot of processed ingredients too like non-dairy creamer for potato chowder. And I don't need a slow cooker to make tea - 8 teabags, water, mint extract and splenda - 2 hours in the old slow cooker and voila, you have something that should take ten minutes to make. Convenient - maybe, Easy - yes, Delicious, no way."
1,Excellent Reducing Diet,"This would be excellent for those on a reducing diet because of the inedible messes it serves up, which reminded me of my mother's best efforts before the advent of slow cookers, and all of us were certainly thin. If the recipes in this cookbook don't put you off slow cooker cooking for sometime to come, you're a hardier soul than my husband and I. The author without fail recommends canned meat products, on the BOTTOM of the slow cooker, a variety of canned items on top, and cooking the whole business to death for hours. Literally, a recipe for disaster and failed nutrition. We thought there was something wrong with us and that slow cooker cooking was always this bad, wondered how anybody could stand it. Then after a hiatus of several years, we came across some truly wonderful slow cooker recipes from other sources. TWO THUMBS DOWN."
2,eh.,"I tried mainly the desserts, which always turned out way too rich. The meat was always dry. The things in the book, I'll eat only because my pride won't let me throw them out. Would I buy any of the things in this book from a restaurant? Probably not. The one thing I learned form this book was that I could make lots of things in the crock pot if I had to. Now I usually make my potato casserole in a crock pot so it can cook while I'm at church, but I use my own recipe for that."
4,Teach how /what to cook in a slow cooker.,"I teach nutrition classes. This cookbook has a variety of recipes and techniques. I hadn't ever ""baked"" a cake in my slow cooker before...the Black Forest Upside-Down Cake is really good! There are several other recipes that I've tried & then had classes try. My biggest concern is with the amount of sodium. Some of the products used ""by name brands"" are not found in our area. I haven't had any problems with substituting those products. I'm sending one of these books to a Granddaughter and will use the others as incentive gifts for my cooking classes."
5,I LOVE THIS COOKBOOK!,"This cookbook is perfect for busy people (or not-so-busy people!)....All the recipes are easy to understand and contain ordinary ingredients that most people would already have. One of my favorites is the Glazed Green Beans....I took them to a cookout and everybody (even 9- and 11-year-old boys) raved about them! They're delicious and make quite a pretty presentation...but they're so easy it's amazing! And I love that each recipe contains all the nutritional information, along with menu ideas for what the dish goes well with.If you read Dawn Hall's inspirational story, you will have an even greater appreciation for her cookbooks. This Christian lady has such a testimony to share...I have the greatest respect for her, and I wholeheartedly recommend her cookbooks!Thanks, Dawn!"
3,Disappointed,"Some of the recipes are too specific, too bland or too hard to find the ingredients. The deserts were serious failures for the most past. However, there are some good recipes in this book."
1,Disappointed,"I returned this book. I tried the turkey and stuffing recipe, and the stuffing was soggy and mushy. Alot of the recipes call for fat-free ingredients that aren't available in Canada."
5,One great collectible 50's cookbook!,This is a tuff one to find! It has it all- great homey recipes and lots of know how to choose from. step back into the era oF the at home mom cooking up a storm everyday for her family!
2,Nicely done. Very informative.,"We enjoyed this video as a family. However, were disappointed with the obvious avoidance of George Washington's faith which he often makes known in his own writings. There could be much more detail given and this man is surely worthy of FAR better."
2,Much better resources available,"This DVD offers a look at Washington's early years where his leadership style was being developed. This sounds good and it was enough to encourage me to purchase it.Unfortunately, it is little more than a chronology of events that occurred prior to the revolution. While these events may indeed have been formative, it does little to unravel the mystery of how this man was able to develop a vision and style to become the American hero that he is.The pace is slow and the narrative is unimaginative. Keep looking; you can do better."
1,Wrong blades,"When I purchased a CX2 for my husband this last holidays, this blades were sold together with it. They don't belong to the CX2 and as soon as my husband broke the first blades, this was a disappointment since he was sure that I had bought replacements."
5,Pick up Ahmad Jamal Cross Country Tour: 1958-1961 instead,"I have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the quality and invention of this release. I have never heard a trio that sounded so big! Their interplay is phenomenal. Jamal is truly one of the greatest Jazz pianist, he's amazingly inventive. However, you might want to consider buying the CD Ahmad Jamal Cross Country Tour: 1958-1961 [LIVE] instead. It includes the tracks from this release (with the exception of ""what's new""?) and 25 others all recorded durring the same era. It is a phenomanal CD!"
5,Killer tracks to dance and think to,"This disc is a killer from beginning to end. Epic, unstoppable deep-groove funk with pulsating percussion, big fat horns and sharp, perceptive social commentary in the lyrics. Get your mind and feet in motion to this masterpiece, the best of its kind in this century."
5,great recording but you've gotta see them live,This band truly dedicates themselves to the feel of the groove. Their live show is full of energy that defies you to remain still....truly something to behold.
2,Jeez,"Weeeeelllll.... let's just say that this book was... disappointing. The characters didn't act at all like gnomes; sure there was craziness, but they seemed too.... human. The plot was pretty poorly explained, jumping around, and thoroughly confusing. The whole Paradise Machine bit was... totally unconvincing and idiotic. Machines with a mind of their own that repair themselves and build things on their own, and operate with the evaporation of water! It was not a good book. Whenever Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman wrote a book, i was totally enthralled, but this book left me thinking ""I might as well finish it; I payed for it...."" *sigh* most of the books not by Weis and Hickman don't seem to _fit_ with the Dragonlance world, and seem to have shaky and weak explanations. Anywho, get this book if you want, but only if it's the only thing left on the shelf."
1,drink coffee,if you want to read this book you'll need some caffine. this book did not hold my interest until 1/2 way through and then it still was boring - i wouldn't recommend it at all
2,Shall we say.. different,"While I won't lambast this book as being ""dumb"" like the previous reviewer, I must say it is ""different."" This is the 21st Dragonlance book I've read, and definetly one of the oddities of the bunch. I don't find the gnomes to necessarily be portrayed as evil, merely different from what the world of Krynn sees them as. The plot is really off the wall, but manages to barely keep itself together into something enjoyable. If you're looking for the normal quality of the Dragonlance series - avoid this book. It doesn't hold up to the quality of any of the other books I've read, but I guess that's what you get when Margaret Weis had nothing to do with it. It's a common problem since the Dragonlance name has become ""exploited"" by various authors. Fergus Ryan seems to have some writing experience under his belt, and it does show here. Otherwise, if you want something different from the usual in the Dragonlance world, The Siege of Mt. Nevermind may be the book you're looking for."
2,This novel was a joke,I have read dozens of dragonlance books and i have to say that this one was terrible. Mr. Ryan had a good concept with the gnomes but he didnt follow it. Next time Mr. Ryan do your homework and maybe your next novel will be worth reading.
5,A soothing chill,"Oh so smooth, soothing and tranquil...like a rhythmic ride on a gently rocking train at a steady speed. Soul satisfying!"
2,Won't fly right,"I flew box kites as a kid. They were simple to build and easy to fly. I'm not sure why, but when built per the instruction, and attached to the string per the instruction, the kite doesn't fly (kind of goes toward the ground). I have tried numerous string positions without success. Maybe you will have better luck - but I expect not."
3,Box Kite's are still fun!,"Just wish they would give some information on where to tie the line, and a few sentences on wind speeds required, and flying directions. Kite is made better than most I have purchased, and we where able to fly."
3,"""Attention Deficit Disorder in Adults"" for patients.","Attention Deficit Disorder in Adults is a fairly good general reference on the subject. The author uses too many case summaries and they tend to be too long. It does not give the adult patient a basis for evulating direction for seeking treatment. It should be noted that, in this case, the patient was a well educated, successful, retired 79 year old male, who had been advised, after a rather extensive test, that he had two or more traits that were attritable to ADD."
1,"Poorly written, doesn't offer much. Save your money.","I found this book to be very poorly written. It doesn't read well, doesn't capture the readers interest (and should since it's aimed at folks with attention deficit!). This seemed like the author's biography more than anything else - very self-indulgent. Lacked real advice. Basically it says there's nothing wrong with you when you have ADD, and that the world really should adapt to you. Not likely to happen in the real world. Don't waste your money."
5,Shawn Michaels,"The is an incredible book if you are looking for a wrestlers biography, this is the one. This a book with a bunch of details. This book will tell you all about Shawns life."
5,Michaels superkick,This is a incredible book on what i would say one of the best wrestlers alive. The author of this book describes Shawns life with many details so that you know what's going on. If you are into wrestling or just looking for a good book to read this is the one.
4,Great!,"Sony has great cameras but also loves complicating ones life.. this litte thing (with a silly price at sony) solved my problem to downlode pics, addapts SD card to fit into my Lenovo and downloads in seconds."
3,"DIRTY & USED, NOT PACKAGED AS ADVERTISED","The 2 MS I bought DID NOT come in a package. BOTH were dirty. I had to clean them but otherwise, they were functioning."
5,Sony Memory Stick Duo Replacement Adaptor,This was a very great deal. The price was excellent and I'd buy from them again. It did not take long for delivery and I was very satisfied with the product.
1,Damaged Goods,Memory stick was damaged and had to work on it to make it work. If wasn't that I needed it right away I would have returned it.
5,Perfect,"I ordered this online because they no longer sell them in my local stores, thanks so much it was exactly what I wanted"
5,Sweet!,"So happy with this purchase. This is a tiny little necessary part. I lost the one that came with my camera, so I needed a replacement. I couldn't find it in the stores and Sony's website had it but it was 4 x as much! This one came in original packaging and was way cheaper. Thanks!"
4,Cheap but good quality - Shipping Problem Satisfied,"This item is difficult to get without memory, but was dirt cheap without it and worked perfectly. I had a problem with shipping but was able to get a refund."
3,Delivery on time but order quality compromised,"Order was delivered on time. However I am really disappointed by the packing. I had order for new product with retail packing. However on delivery, the retail package was not available. The 1st delivery was defective and they send me a replacement which luckily worked."
5,Compatible with Sandisk pro duo,I purchased my adaptor directly from Sony's website (no tax + free S/H) for $9.99. I was a little hesitant at first because I had a 1 GB sandisk pro duo card and I wasn't sure how it would work out. But fortunately the Sandisk card + Sony adaptor work just great! With this adaptor I can easily switch between a PSP and my digital camera.
4,Works Great!,"This product worked great. The first time I used it, Windows took about 10 seconds to locate the right driver, but after that it pops up almost instantly. The only problem I had was that the one I ordered had a photo of a small plastic case to store the adapter in, however the item I recieved (new in Sony facory package) did not contain the case shown."
4,Good price,Product and Price were both great. Cheapest deal i found online. However i did expect to receive the item a few days before than it arrived.
1,DONT BUY WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,I bought this product thinking what a great way to have more memory for my old Sony...well I bought one and it didnt work at all errors kept appearing and I could not take not even one picture!!! So I thought ok it could be just that one was broken but I was wrong and very disappointed. I love my Sony camera but now it looks like I will have to buy a different camera because I can not find a memory stick that will work. Disappointed!
5,No problems here,So far everything is working great. Cant complain about it at all.. Does its job and works fine. Great item to have.
3,"Great performance ruined by post production ""sweetening""","I've seen BB in concert four times (twice near the time of this recording), and he is always a lot better in concert than on his studio recordings. This is a recording of a concert, however later they ""sweetened"" it in the studio, adding a bunch of junk that seriously detracts from the performance. If you can listen past the ""sweetener"", it is great. If it weren't for the ""sweetener"" that was added, this would be at least a 4 star CD."
5,A preference for spaghetti,"What a marvelous movie, and one that I enjoy more every time I see it! Just watching Fred Astaire walk across a room is a delight. And it's fun to see how much naughty innuendo they managed to sneak past the early Hayes office. There's an astonishing amount of gay subtext: the cast is largely populated by classic ""sissies"" such as Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore. And then there's the flamboyant Italian ""professional co-respondent"": women are safe with him because ""Tonetti, he prefers spaghetti"" (!!). Signor Tonetti is married, but he refers to his wife as ""he"" (I had to rewind the tape twice to believe my ears on that one). Of course, that's just his mangling of the English language, heh-heh....."
5,Delightful Musical,"This is the first starring vehicle for Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers in a series of musicals they did for RKO in the 1930's. All the basic plots tend to be the same - some crazy misunderstanding keeps the pair at odds until Fred finally dazzles Ginger with his dancing, everything is resolved, & they are reconciled. Yes, the plots creak & the dialogue is silly but watch it for the lovely deco sets & costumes, the music, & the dance numbers. It is all great fun & a must for Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers fans."
4,Makes you want to take dance lessons,"This wasn't my favorite Astaire/Rogers movie, but it is entertaining and the choreography is never a disappointment. I enjoyed seeing the old character actors on screen once again. The storyline is typical of early Hollywood but seeing Fred and Ginger dance makes it worth a couple hours of your time."
4,"If you're looking for a classic rom-com, this is it","A silly plot, along with Rogers & Astaire's dancing at its finest, makes this a great movie whether you're spending the evening with a loved one or a pint of Ben & Jerry's. Timeless."
3,question,"The CD arrived in wonderful condition. My question: it states on the back ""Disc Onc"" - was there supposed to be a Disc Two sent as well? When I ordered, I expected it to be the complete item. Thanks."
3,not quite shea scented,"I love the scent of shea butter so I thought I'd give this a try. It's a difficult lotion to find locally so I thought I'd order it and see if I liked it. The moisturizer part of the lotion makes your skin feel so, so soft. My only issue with this particular product was the lack of shea butter scent. It does still smell really good, a coconut scent. I believe I'll be buying the original cocoa butter formula that I can find locally."
2,Greasy and takes forever to rub in,This product is a little too greasy and takes a long time to rub in. Did not notice any significant difference in my skin after using up the entire bottle. Not recommended.
2,So-so album. Probably not worth the price.,"Uninspiring... they could have come up with something better after seven years of absence. Then again, perhaps the fact that they couldn't cut it explains why they were in hiding for seven years. But then they decided to return to the world of the living but all they could manage was two-and-a-half decent tracks - ""Paradise"" comes to mind here and may be one or two of the others depending on your musical inclinations. But nothing more than that... music is mostly recycled and lyrics comes from the same dictionary they used in 1975. Well you cannot do this for twenty years without suffering the consequences unless you are as crazy as Iggy Pop or as successful as Rolling Stones or as commercially driven as Elton John (this could be a point of contention but you get my drift, right?)."
4,April Wine ages well,"Being an April Wine fan, I love this newest music from the now inducted into the Canadian Rock Hall of Fame band. April Wine has aged well, it's not hard and heavy but nice and mellow, some bands don't never get it and never will & continue to try to rock hard, it's ok to age your music. Fans won't be disappointed."
4,Welcome Back What a Treat,Great return to the studio for a true classic rock band. The sounds and vocals are very current in style yet carry a great rock sound. I am usually one who calls remakes a rip off but wow.....what a job on the Remake of Simon and Garfunkels I Am A Rock. Hopefully this is a teasing taste of still more great work to come from a band that really deserves a Juno....cmon Canada give this album some serious airtime!
2,A long time coming,"Made in CAN in 2001, Serial# CR-1048-2, Playing Time 44:00Up here in the Great White North, AW released this album after a 7-year wait: their previous album, ""Frigate"", was released back in 1994.This new slice of plastic features 11 new tracks, including a cover of Paul Simon's ""I Am A Rock"" as a closer.Unfortunately, the band has lost its momentum since their glory days of the 80's, and this album shows no vitality; sure, there's Myles Goodwyn's distinctive vocals, a few nice melodies, but the album falls flat in the arrangements department. Considering some of the great output this act has managed to put out in the past, this album should (and will) be quickly forgotten.You're better off grabbing ""First Glance"", ""Harder Faster"", ""The Nature Of The Beast"", or 1 of many classic ""Greatest Hits"" packages. I've given this album a half-dozen spins so far, but it simply doesn't cut it."
2,"Good graphics, poor gameplay","The two stars for this game are both for graphics. This game has by far the best graphics of any baseball game available for GBA. Graphics are nice, but it doesn't make a game.Gameplay is bad. There's nothing else to say. When you do get a hit, it always goes up the middle. Baserunning is a joke, you can get thrown out at first from the outfield. Pitching is ok, but I've never enjoyed pitching on any baseball game. I'm interested in batting and running.Don't buy this game. I traded mine in for something else."
4,Great Game!,"I have to say this is one of the few Star Wars titles that I actually love to play. Although it definately has it's rough spots (like when thousands of enemies are coming from everywhere AND your getting blasted from hidden turrets, lol) but overall I've really enjoyed playing this game!"
4,Great game - run and gun baby!,"Well, its a great no doubt about it. Sometimes the ID Scanner/Weapon select is cumbersome but id imagine if this was a real life situation, that would be an accurate portrayal. my only real complaint isnt with the game itself, but with my 3rd party memory card (InterAct's 16mb Mega Memory Card)The game would not recognize mine. I contacted InterAct and have received no response for over a week. So be warned, if you want this game and have that terrible memory card, its gonna cost you $75 instead of $50. For me its been worth every penny. Dead or Alive."
4,"Fun, but very repetitive","This game is good, but it gets VERY repetitive. In the first level after you beat the boss guy, it doesn't even tell you what to do. You spend 15 minutes trying to find a vent. You start off as Jango Fett, then you get a jetpack, then you get jetpack missles. (I love the missles!) It's fun overall, but once you die, you have to start off from where you left off. Then, if you die a total of five times, you have to start the level over. I give this game 4 stars, because it has WONDERFUL graphics, and has a good storyline. Other than that, I give this game a rent. Rent it, don't buy it unless you're a major Jango fan."
4,sweet game but a little hard,"ya this game has ok graphics and has great gameplay you have an arsanal of hot weapins including 2 blaster guns a flamethrower a huge rocket and so much more. sometimes i get to the point were i have no idea what to do or were to go,and sometimes therers unlimited guys that try to kill you and it got a little boring. but i really recomend this game to any one"
5,Star Wars Bounty Humter,This is an excellent game and very challenging. My son has had hours of playing fun. He gives it his highest rating.
4,Jango Fett the bounty hunter,"You get to use Jango Fett in this game. It takes place before episode 2 but, after episode 1. The funny thing is that sometimes when you shoot someone they fall and scream. Also it's funny how the guy with the rocket launcher falls over. This game can be hard but, it's fun. Theres like one problem when you fight the krayt dragon in the throne room it doesn't make sense how that thing could knock you over from like 20 feet away. Overall I give it 9.6."
1,Why?,"Why is anyone reviewing this game if they haven't played it? Are you guys idiots? You sit there and say this game will be great, but the only reference you have is what the company putting out the game has said and what screen shots you've seen. Do us all a favor and SHUT UP! until you have played the game."
1,who cares about Jango Fetts life,OK as you can see in my title Jango Fett was in one out of six movies and they make an entire game about him how stupid first of all they made up crap that just makes the moveis look stupid why would Jabba the Hutt wana kill Jango when jangos son becomes Jabbas best budy you can fly in your jet pack for about five freakin seconds before you run out of fuell and its just not fun capturing random people on the streets its a bad game they should go make some more games about luke and lea and our best budy Han and stop making crapy games about people that are in one freakin movie
2,STAR WARS EPISODE II ATTCAK OF THE CLONES : BOUNTY HUNTER,STAR WARS BOUNTY HUNTER IS FROM ATTCAK OF THE CLONES .
2,not too horrible...,"if youre 12, i assume it isnt.i anticipated some halfway decent or complicated or well thought out game.what i got:cheesy movement and simple gameplay thats better suited to a 9 year old's tastes.altho the movie sequences in between levels are stunning you find yourself thrown back into a simple world with automatic aim,boring enemies and environments and very little to look forward to hunting down bounties etc...skip this."
4,Jango is awesome!,"Game play is challenging and fun. It's like Star Wars meets Tomb Raider. That is the best way I can describe it. I am only at end of Chapter 3 at the moment...so far, so good :)"
4,really fun platformer,"I think out of all of the platform games I've played in the last few years, this was my favorite. Sure some of the jumping/flying/falling parts were a gigantic pain in the rectum. But the animation was awesome, the storyline was good, the cutscenes alone are worth the money, and some of the level layouts were imaginative and new.So far this is my favorite next gen star wars game."
2,Bloated and Pedantic. Editor needed!,"This 500 page book could easily have been half as long, and twice as effective, with a good editor. Weiner is a newspaper reporter that obviously became drunk on the idea of not being held to time & length limitations as he usually is in the newspaper. He is very repetitive and it takes away from some of the very sound ideas that he proposes. Skim this one."
5,My 2 year old's FAVORITE!,"I have watched this DVD in its entirety and I am very pleased with the cute songs, colorful outfits, and songs. My daughter can watch this DVD over and over again. If you're trying to make a decision on which Dora movies to get, this one is a winner!"
5,Ev1 luvs Dora,My daughter luvs Dora & i luv the fact that it has a play all option so she's good for over a hour.
4,My daughter loves it,What can I say? My little girl loves Dora. I actually like this one myself because it has a story. All the other Dora shows are about her following a map and are approximately the same.
3,Maybe i'm not a fan of GG,"I think the game concept is very good that you can use all the moveswhile you are playing store mode i like this kind of concept, butif you can go online like tekken 6 with others and that would be morefun because it's too board if you play by yourself."
5,A great way to introduce David Wilcox to a friend,"This is the album I select when I want to introduce someone to David Wilcox - which I only do when the person, like the album, means something to me. Yes, it has an edge; but so does life. Every song on this well-developed album appears carefully chosen to appeal to a different mood or time in each of our lives. Others have already spoken of Blow 'Em Away and Johnny's Camaro which were the only two I ever heard on radio. Check out ""You Should See The Way It Feels"" and ""Golden Day"" for the more reflective side of David Wilcox. I've read some of the critical reviews and smiled; David anticipates their reaction and comments about in on several intros, but I urge you - don't walk out on this concert on CD. My 18 year old daughter still comments about the right way to eat a mango, which we learned from this album! The wide range of topics, moods and delivery on this album makes it unique - and a must buy."
5,Dave at His Best,"Within the past year, I learned that David Wilcox existed. I was also fortunate enough to catch him in concert. Suffice to say, this is the best way to listen to a Wilcox tune. EAH comes as close as any to the actual experience and should not be missed by any fans of his music."
2,Don't Start Here,"This is Dave at his most self-indulgent. I love Dave's music but these stories just don't come through my speakers as well as one or two of them do during a live show. Johnny's Camaro is a cool idea but at 8 minutes +, I would rather spend this time with American Pie, or Tae Bo. If you are wanting to give this guy a try, and you really should, start with How Did You Find Me Here."
1,Disillusioned,"After listening to the beautifully spiritual ""How did you find me here,"" I hoped for more along those lines, but this loud and annoying effort gave me the feeling he was spitting on that wholesomeness. Maybe he changed or was jaded by success, but this almost ruined his earlier stuff for me."
1,Stale and Tasteless,"We love linguini and clams and have always used Doxsee (Snow's) canned minced clams. The juice has a pleasant and very ""clammy"" taste. But the price went way up so I tried ordering Chicken of the Sea on a subscription. Big disappointment! As soon as I opened the cans I could see that the color was ""off"" and the smell was stale and tinny. I could hardly smell clams at all. The taste was just as disappointing. I have cancelled my subscription."
5,Dragging old school muscle into the 21st century the easy way,"If your looking at injecting almost any engine this is the book. Its written so anyone can understand it. The layout really suits my learning style, never seems to complex and seems to come from a really down to earth guy who knows what the average Joe is trying to do. If you've looked into injection and think you cant afford it, think again. This book will save you hundreds. Explains all the sensors and hardware required and how they need to be fitted to inject almost any engine. Great links and websites where these parts can be bought in most cases cheaper than you'd think. Great book for the beginner with enough ideas proposed for more advanced people wanting to take the extra step. A must have."
1,Awful.....HATE IT!!,"I have owned this vacuum for just about 2 years and after the 1st 6 months the ""self-cleaning"" hepa filter stopped self-cleaning. Now I need to stick my hand in there and clean it myself...YUK! Today, the beater bar stopped beating!!! I took the whole bottom plate off, cleaned it all out and still NOTHING!! We now have 5 yes 5 dogs (don't get me started), and my vacuum decided it was not going to work anymore. I really need a vacuum now, to say the least. The old adage ""you get what you pay for"" really doesn't apply cuz we got this thing when it 1st came out and it was alittle over $300."
1,Worst Vaccum ever,"Stay away. This is the Hoover revenge. ""When"" it works it works very well. Unfortunately this working well only happens after it has been completely cleaned and lasts about 5-10 minutes. The self cleaning Hepa Filter is a lie and someone should have started a class action lawsuit.The stepper motor gears on the Hepa Filter have stripped twice. It is very difficult to find spares and the hoover repair centers charge and arm and a leg for repair.I bought this based on my good experience with the first windtunnel, however have been very dissapointed with this one. I contacted hoover about the quality and all they did was refer me to a repair center, who by the way wanted to charge me $60 to ""clean the unit"" - this was after 3 months of use and when the hepa stopped functioning.Another problem is the switch over ""valve"" which switches suction from the brush intake to the removable hose. This continually fails and leaves no suction through the hose and tools"
1,Stupid Me!,"I always (almost, anyway) check the web for product reviews. Our other hoovers were great. This one is awful! Filter clogged after the third use. Local hoover repair shop was rude and not helpful. Had to use dust buster and compressed air to clean it. Still the filter wouldn't turn. And what a mess. Must empty the container outside. I can fix anything...except this piece of junk. I am embarrassed that I bought this vacuum. Please don't tell my buddies."
1,The worst I have seen,"The hepa filter stopped working in less then a month, looses suction quickly because it cloggs, a mess too dump the bagless canister, there is nothing I can say ""good"" about this vacuum. I hate it."
1,bad bad bad don't loose your money,"I had this vacuum for less than a year and broke 4 times at the end Hoover recognized it was bad, so they gave a different and new vacuum. Now I am happy without it."
3,Vacumming,This product is okay. I enjoy it but it isnt anthing specail just another vacuum with a fancy name!
2,"Sucks great but, sucks","Giving 2 stars on the suction alone. Hepa filter doesn't self-clean/turn after one use. A lot of dirt falls out from the hepa filter when removing the dirt box or collects behind the the dirt box if you don't pay very close attention to aligning it just right. I really liked how much dirt this thing pulls out of the carpet but it's heavy and dirt just falls out, a lot of dirt, when emptying the dirt box. I'm returning and not getting another after reading the other reviews in here that sound just like my experience."
1,Dont buy this -- nothing but problems,"I bought this vacuum 11 months ago. At first, it was great. After about 2-3 months, the problems started. The spinning Hepa filter gets jammed with dirt/hair and stops spinning. Then it packs full of dirt and loses suction. Without suction, its worthless.I have had this vacuum in the repairshop 6 times for this same problem. Thankfully there is a 12 month warranty so I havent had to pay to get it repaired. Unfortunately, my warranty is about to run out. The last time I was in, repair shop told me that I need to use another vacuum to clean this one out periodically. Am I supposed to borrow my neighbor's vacuum to clean mine? What a crock....Several times, I have called Hoover's main number in Ohio to complain. When I do get to talk to someone, they are NOT helpful. They only tell me to take the thing to the local service center. I have had Hoovers all my life (this is my 4th Hoover). After this experience, I will NEVER buy one again."
2,Consider another make or model.,"The only downfall to this vacuum is it's very heavy and not self propelled. With paying over $300, you would think it should be a standard thing on this model. Also, with the previous review it is a little messy when you are emptying the canister and dirt does fall behind the cup. I think it's a bit overpriced. You are paying for the look of the cleaner and not the features."
1,DO NOT BUY,"If I could give it zero stars, I would. This vacuum was such a waste of money. As every other review, the filters DO NOT self clean. They clog. It's messy emptying. Sucks good, but is it worth the time cleaning up twice? Not to mention how unbelievably heavy it is...simply DO NOT waste your money. I replaced with a Shark nv22l. Just like a dyson but cheaper. Hoover, ya lost some customers on this one."
1,Hoover Sucks - I Wish,"This vacuum is junk. In the trash can after only a year and a couple of months. Broken belts, clogged filters, noisy and now, the motor is gone. Save your money."
1,Repairs taking over 3 months,"We bought this model Nov. of 2006. It quit in Feb 07, and Hoover doesn't have part available to repair it, says it could be May before we get it back.(They say it's the on-off switch, it won't turn on) They are very sorry and extended our warranty for a year. I've owned Hoovers for 25 years but will never buy another one. Before it quit I did like the extending wand. It was a mess each time you emptied it, and we had to empty it every time we vacuumed or it plugged up."
1,"7 weeks in the shop, still not fixed, please dont buy this one!","Bought this vac at Christmas 2006, used it through March 07, and liked the way it sucked up dirt. The bagless design could be better but I don't have any real issues with that. However, machine quit working right in the middle of vacuuming one day; it just died. Would not power on at all. Took it to the actual Hoover retailer, not a dealer. Its been there ever since. June is tomorrow.That's 7 weeks with no vac. No explanation other than ""cant get the part"" - circuit board apparently suffered a failure. It's extremely disappointing. Especially for the price, and from a company that has made vacs for 100 years!After 30 years + with my last vac(which still works by the way) and making the plunge to a ""modern"" HEPA filtered-bagless unit, having this experience with Hoover has left me quite depressed. Will not buy another Hoover product ever. Please save your money and get something better."
1,Hoover Windtunnel 2 Surface Command,The attachmet was broken within two weeks. Impossible to get anyone from Hoover to help me! The vacuum also clogs very easy and is difficult to clean out. I have always owned Hoover Vacuums but this model is a looser.
5,Nexxus Omnistyler Designing Liquid,I've tried many products for my fine hair over the years but my search is over. This gives it body and hold without being too heavy. I have ordered it 3 times now from Amazon. For me it works great.
5,The Perfect Gel for curly hair!!,"This is the perfect Gel for my curls!! It is so wonderful to find an alcohol free gel, eliminates the frizz!"
4,damm!!! off the chain!!!,Never heard of them but I saw the cover and took a listen then heard sample so I purchased one at cduniverse its cheaper. Heard the whole album and damm!!! its off the chain!!! They rap mostly about religous topics beats are dark and haunting overall I enjoyed it. Surf the web for they website and even they website is haunting they website stated another album for 2004 cant wait if its haunting like this one im a cop one. They website is daformulaz.homestead.com check it out.
4,Entertaining Overall,"I'm glad I bought this. I saw it before, but was hesitant to buy, then started reading reviews and thought I'd give it a shot.The opening scene was pretty epic and set the tone. The characters are very likable and I liked how the samurai got to know and respect each other throughout the course of the 26 episodes.The music was very well done. It reminded me of the original movie. It has an old school feel to it. I felt like I was transported to a different time. It gave me the sense that I was actually on the battlegrounds with the samurai all the way to being with the peasants in the rice patties. Had a great deal of immersion.I liked the nods it made to the original film. The story, for me, started off a bit slow. It takes a little while before all the 7 samurai are assembled, but once all the pieces are set and put in motion, Samurai 7 tells a great tale of honor, sacrifice and duty."
5,Epic,"This is Japanese Animation at its best. There is Ghost in the Shell S.A.C., Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and I never thought I would say this but this is the best. An epic character driven story with an ending that just plain delivers. Hollywood take note. This is how it is done."
3,Mixed bag,"Samurai 7 has it strengths: some interesting character choices, reasonably high production values, a slower pace that allows the story and characters to develop, and, of course, samurai fighting giant robots (sweet!). However, the series also delivers plenty of awkward and simply bad emotional exposition, several of the characters we've seen before (in every martial arts movie ever made), and the plot stretches a bit thin as the original 3 hour epic is expanded to 8 or 9 hours. Fans of anime, robots, samurai and so forth will find some good popcorn entertainment."
3,The first two thirds are awesome. Then.....meh.,"So I just got done watching this and the first two thirds of this series were amazing. I was watching it thinking I had finally found the perfect anime. They truly did honor to Akira Kurosawa with their adaptation. Then they finished up Kurosawa's storyline and things quickly devolved into ""What? Huh? This is crap!"" I was quite disappointed. So I give it 3 out of 5 because the part that adapted Kurosawa's 7 Samurai was truly worth of 5 or even 6 stars if you could rate it that way, but afterwards it was less than a 1 star anime."
5,Samurai 7: Box Set,This was a great price for the box set ($26). Other online sites were $10 to $20 more. My son loved them and stayed awake to finish all DVD's in one night.
5,great series,"This is a great series. Not to give too much away, but it's basically about, well seven samurai, who are hired by a poor village to protect them from bandits who steal their rice. There's much more than just that, and there, of course, is a decent amount of character developments as well. There's very little in the way of extras, but I won't criticize this dvd set, because that's very typical of anime releases. The animation is very well done in most scenes of the series, and the sound is very good as well. This series prompted me to upgrade my speakers. I definitely recommend this series to anime fans who haven't seen it yet. There's a good amount of action, sword slicing, stuff blowing up, etc..."
3,"Effective, but not durable","While it was sometimes tough to get it set comfortably, I thought it did its job well. However, after about 6 months, the velcro seems to have worn out, which makes me have to wear it looser or tighter than I'd prefer."
5,Timeless Organically Electronic Music,"The trio that comprises Kiln carefully construct a sonic pallet that woos the mind. Royal Peppermint Forest (one of my favorite songs by them) is a warm and proper introduction to one of the best ep's electronic music has to offer. Ghost (another favorite) is aptly titled with it's wonky tapping percussion and haunting synth that floats in and out of the song. Honestly, the first two tracks would be enough to satisfy me despite my ADD behavior when it comes to music.. That isn't to say that the last three songs aren't amazing as well. Words just are not going to convey the creativity and soul behind these songs, just listen. Everything is here, hip-hop, glitch, jazz, post-rock... you just have to find it. I recommend any Kiln release, but Sunbox is a must."
1,Absolute garbage,"You might as well throw your money away instead of buying these. The cord separated from the plug after less than a week of pretty minor (less than 1hr per day, no pulling) use."
1,Terrible,"These are very uncomfortable. I have small ears and these started to hurt after only 30 minutes of use. I had to turn up the volume on my music when I used these earbuds compared to my ancient, lower-quality-line Sony (over the head) earphones. The sound quality was not good.Also, the packaging states that the cords contain lead and you should wash hands after handling the earbuds. SCARY!!!Do yourself a favor and get something better quality. What is the point of spending a lot of money on a good music player if your earbuds don't let you hear it well?"
1,Terrible -- worse than airline freebies,"I'm certainly no audiophile: to the contrary, I favor sub-$10 ear buds as I'm hard on them, lose them with some frequency and like to leave pairs in various places around the house. I've bought other inexpensive Coby buds before and never had any issues.These were absolute trash. Sound quality and volume were both so bad that, after 10 seconds of listening, I couldn't continue. This product is so bad that I'd be reluctant to buy any other Coby bud at any price. Amazon, IMHO, should remove this model from its offerings.Absolute garbage."
1,Save for a better pair,"Don't buy these. I got them in a bundle when I bought a microphone, so I'm not upset that I spent money on them. I just want to let you know they suck. The wires are super thin. The quality is horrible. It takes at least 50% more volume to hear your devise and the quality of the sound is bad anyway.Saving money by buying such a cheap pair is not worth it. Save up your pocket change and buy a $5 pair or better."
1,Not Worth It,"I ordered these headphones after my JVC headphones broke. I just needed a temporary pair until I returned the school where the sell the JVC ones for really cheap. I ordered these and was very disappointed. One headphone arrived damage which already made me upset and to top it off the sound quality was HORRIBLE. The headphones that came with my blackberry had much better sound quality. These headphones kind of remind of the ones you find in a dollar store and clearly cost em more than one dollar. Even for a temporary pair, these headphones were not worth the price."
2,you get what you paid for,I bought these earphones for 2 dollars and I guess I should have expected low quality since in fact when I opened them and tried them out I could already hear static on one ear-piece and after a while I saw that the connection of the wire with the jack was loose so the sound kept shutting off and on. My advice is pay a few dollars more for something better.
5,Awesome,This headphone is Coby my big brother likes it so do I and when I see it I makes me wanna spit on it
5,"Great quality, beautiful craftmanship, stupidly inexpensive!","Beautifun forged iron. This item usually draws attention from my guests as it's obvious hand wrought ditinctive look and quality.Fantastic price, and it has held up in my small kitchen for a couple of years now.My advice? If you need a pot rack that is not too large then get it!"
4,Love at first smell...,Fresh. Not tipical. Very undiscovered. After applied high musky notes. Long lasting.... And smells different on different people. Seriously I tested it for that. Make a good presence without being overpowering. I'd def recommend it.
1,Men's? ...or Women's?,"I received this item and was surprised upon opening the package to find that the outside box stated that this was Paul Smith Extreme For Men, however the bottle inside was in fact Paul Smith Extreme For WOMEN. Although the women's scent is nice, it wasn't quite as manly as I was hoping for. On the bright side, my best friend's wife ended up with a nice bottle of WOMEN'S perfume and I was left with the scent of my deodorant, which is nice, but..."
1,Expected something else...,"I expected this to be the character background music from the series, but it was not, and was not up to the quality of the music from the show... very disappointing."
1,QuarkXpress 6.0 is a joke,"I am actually writting this review while on the phone with their tech support group in India. I can barely understand the person and the can you believe that you have to call them to reactivate the software every time we go from Daylight Savings Time to Daylight Time. That is twice per year. There is a bug in their authentication/serial number system, which by design includes the DST flag for the local computer in the activation routine.This is crazy...After paying full price for two copies, why do I have to spend 30 minutes per machine twice per year to reactivate their product to help them control piracy, of which I am not a part of.Sounds like class action suit time...We should all sue for the time lost just in reactivating their products.I used to be happy with version 3.x and 4.x."
1,Don't bother.,My experience with Quark has also been a nightmare and no one at Quark ever even suggested that their software might just be the problem. I was never offered even an upgrade much less a refund. I asked for a refund and didn't get it. I guess they think $800-900 isn't a lot of money. I noticed the price has been greatly reduced since I bought mine. Good luck to everyone else who has purchased Quark and my condolences to you all.
3,Not very intuitive.,"Quark Xpress 6 could really use a better manual. I prefer Adobe InDesign, but my job requires me sometime to work with Quark. Maybe I am just the Dummy that they write all those books for..."
1,Quark is over.,"As a professional designer and creative director (who learned on Quark), I was never so happy in my life to spend one afternoon switching and learning Indesign. Adobe is a designer-friendly company that has created an elegant and seamless product. Ten minutes after starting to learn Indesign, I was ready to bid Quark a happy adieu. And I haven't looked back. Service bureaus love Indesign as much as I do and I have never had a problem with a press. Indesign is a far cry from Pagemaker (I am certain the reviewer who called it a joke has never used it- maybe they have all their church bulletins already set up in a quark template?)"
1,question,is there a chance of taking mirror print (whole page) with more than 1 colon edit in any versionsif printer is not postscript
1,Deceptive advertising - DOES NOT regulate voltage,"I purchased this power conditioner/regulator recently. In testing, I found that the output voltage followed the input with no apparent attempt to regulate the voltage. In talking with the manufacturer, it turns out the unit does not regulate in the normal sense of the word - it has a huge deadband that causes it to ignore normal line voltage variations. I was seeing from 113.5 to 119 out of the unit. I would also note that the spec sheet supplied indicates that for an 87 volt to 129 volt input, the output is 120. It doesn't to that.I am planning on returning the unit ASAP."
2,Not 20 Amps for most folks...,Inside the box is an unattached plug that will not fit a standard USA household outlet. When we first saw this plug we assumed it was for a non-USA outlet. But the literature inside the box states that for 20 Amp protection to work this plug must be installed and then plugged into a special outlet on a dedicated circuit.Why they don't explain this in the product description on the website or Amazon? ...sales of course! Bad show.We would not have bought this knowing it will not provide the advertised 20 Amp rating without hiring an electrician to rewire a dedicated circuit and otherwise unusable outlet. Not recommended.
1,Overshoots Voltage Correction,"While the unit's construction appears to be solid it has an engineering flaw: when voltage drops slightly below 115V, it overcorrects the problem and starts outputting 126V (which is actually more dangerous to my equipment than a slightly low voltage like 114V.) Wouldn't have known had I not pulled out a multimeter to test it."
3,You know what you are getting,"This CD cannot be recommended to anyone who didn't see the Eurosong show. This CD is a complete release of all the entries, so here you will get all the songs you liked along with all the songs you didn't like. Personally I enjoy listening to about half of the songs (hence the three stars), while the other half is more often than not simply awful. The CD is wonderful for fans of the Eurovision, viewers who enjoyed most of the music on the show, and friends and family of the contestants. It is NOT an interesting CD for anyone who is unfamiliar with the Eurosong tradition and it certainly does not give a very good impression of the state of contemporary European pop music.It does, however, include the track ""Ne ver ne boisja"" by t.A.T.u, which is not available anywhere else, and so this CD might be a worth-while investment if you're a die-hard t.A.T.u. fan."
4,Beautiful show,"Reviewer: Lisa from LatviaI am from the country where this Eurovision contest took place, from Latvia. I was really surprised aaabout the beautiful song of Norway which had to win this year. I liked also Belgium song which reminded me Enigma and of course our latvian song ""Hallo From Mars"". It was extreemely good. I did not like the turkish song and I can not understand its 1-st place. Also russian Tatu song was of low quality. These girls have no voices but only big ambitions.It is pity we can not see the beautiful show of this 2003 competition in CD."
2,Might Work For Some,"It never hurts to see what different tactics work for people. In the author's case, his attempts to charm others may very well work for him. But in my opinion, anybody with half a brain would see right through these transparent attempts to play to a person's good side. What's wrong with good old fashioned straight forward honesty? I'd like to think it still exists somewhere in our professional and personal society.Also, I think the author does make a valid attempt to engage the reader as if he were talking one on one, but in my opinion he just comes across as very condescending.Overall, I would personally take a different approach to try and earn a client's respect and trust, but for those of you looking for a new avenue to take with your business ventures, it very possible might have some helpful nuggets for you."
3,Used,A good way to tell whether this is a good book or not is by looking at how many used copies are for sale by Amazon customers. This book was released on Nov. 1 2004 and as of today (Feb 2 2005) there are 50 (!!!!!!!) used copies already for sale. What does that tell you? It tells you that this is one bad book that is not worth buying.
4,RPG can be fun,First I want to say I was a little dissappointed when I heard it was a rpg game. Reason being I never played one before thats all. This game made me a rpg lover. well anyways I think the overall game is great. Good story line lots a choices and side stories. My only dissapointment is was the game was not longer and you see a few characters that look the same and you say to yourself did I not meet this person before. However these things did not take away from my overall experience of the game and I feel a proud owner of X-box to have played this game. I can dream that they will make another rpg of Star wars for x-box and like some people I talked to I have the same opinion which is it fullfills a lot of star wars fantasy. Thanks for a great star wars experience!!!!!1
2,This game does not feel like star wars.,I wasted 30 dollars. Tutorials are extremely anoying and the quest seem pointless. The game offers no freedom and it does not have a dynamic feel to it. Want to have fun buy Star wars Jedi academy. I must also mention that the art work and characters seem plain. I hope this helps.
3,Too difficult to play...,"I've played this game for a little while now, and to be honest it's too complex for a first person shooter. I guess in a way it's not a first person shooter, but rather a RPG. Either way, you spend more time navigating choices for weapons and powers than you do in game play. It get's so tedious that I haven't played it much more than the day I opened it. Maybe it's just not my type of game, but I'm pretty disappointed. I've played plenty of other games like this, but this one is so over-done it's like eating a steak that's been burnt to a crisp. Yeah, it's protein, but damn it's hard to digest."
4,Good but hard,This game has a great story and some fun goals but this game is also very hard. It takes up a lot of time on your schedule. The RPG battles are pretty simple and stupid. The graphics are normal but the cutscenes have bad graphics. Overall this game is stunning and one of the best star wars games but make sure you are willing to play for a long time cause this game is pretty long and pretty hard
5,"Oldie, but still a goodie","I'm not a role player. I don't claim to be. I don't really play role players in my spare time when no one is watching. I did like Mass Effect, but that was the first. Being an avid Star Wars fan, I figured I needed to play one of the ""best games of all-time"". So I decided to buy Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic (SWKOTOR). I loved it. I've been playing it for a month now. I've beaten it as a goody-two shoes jedi and now I'm going back to play it again as a dark lord. I didn't take a break from it at all. I'm thinking about even going back again and trying to beat it a 3rd time when I'm done to see how another class upgrades. Amazing game."
5,The Bomb,"I would not count myself as one of the legions of Star Wars fanatics, but can say without any hesitation that this game is one of the best titles available for the Xbox. Apart from a varying storyline with characters you can actually like, this game provides gameplay that is both intense and controllable. Although it may seem akward at first, relying as it does on each character taking turns, the game truly pulls you in and in a very short time your going to be equipping your characters, shuffling force powers and setting course for a variety of worlds. And then there are all the sideline adventures/puzzles.What I would recommend is that you purchase this game along with some food and water because you might not leave the house for a while."
5,Welcome to the Light Side! Best Game Ever!,"This is undoubtedly the best video game I have ever played. There is nothing better than a good RPG story, and the battle style is fabulous for those all night sessions when you can't point and shoot to save your life. The story is fabulous, graphics: fabulous, characters: fabulous. I didn't know a video game could be this good. Can't wait for the sequel, but looking at the times it took for this one to come out, it's going to be a while."
3,Lucas finally got it right,"The best Star Wars game ever, I just can't stop playing it!!! It arrived in perfect condition, but did take forever to get here.I am in the military, and because of that, I have a weird address to ship to..."
2,Too many bugs,"Freezes constantly! The cut scenes have not worked yet, and the game will stop in the middle of loading. It skips during action sequences. The level maps themselves are the ""go here - do this"" type with no room for original thought or puzzle solving of any kind. The characters were interesting at time, but the plot kept jumping in the way. I'd be in the middle of going somewhere on a level and I'd be prompted to talk to one of the other characters. I found this game frustrating and monotonous. Morrowind is far superior in ever respect. Maybe my expectations are too high. Maybe I bought a defective copy. What ever the reason, I'm annoyed that I paid as much for this game as I did."
5,the best star war game ever!!!!!,The one of best roleplaying game out there.The fighting is not the best but it is so awsome!theres around 6to9 planets to go to.YOU can find and build your own weopons.THERES new alions(fish people I HATE THEME) .so awsome you can get up to 9 team members.I didnt like one so I killed him.buy this game!!!NOW!!!!!!!!!!
5,KOTOR is my favorite game! Thanks BioWare,"KOTOR is my favorite video game ever! I was not really into RPGs before this game, but now they are my favorite type of game. The storyline is my favorite part of the game. The twists and turns are so much fun and surprising! BioWare really did a wonderful job with game. Carth is one of my favorite characters ever (along with Sky from another BioWare game, Jade Empire). The fighting system is easy to use. I love that you can pause it to give your orders to everyone else in the party. This is the best game, and I can't wait for BioWare to do KOTOR 3! 2 was good, but not as great as the original! I have played this game through 6 different times, as a male and female as each of the class types. I have also varied being light side and dark side. It really does make an interesting and different story each time I've played it through. Get this game if you don't already have it!"
5,years of enjoyment,I played this game years ago and beat it about eight times. After a few years off I was thinking back to the game and remembered the great story so I had to play it again. I recommend to ALL.
4,KOTOR: Worth the Wait,This game was deffinetly worth the wait. Bioware did an excellent job capturing the essence of the Star Wars universe in this title. This game's graphics and controls are excellent. The story is good and clear even for those not familiar with Star Wars. The game's battle system and character development is good but could have been better. The generation model could have used more depth. I think that they could have made the addition of more skills and the ability to choose another race. A very good RPG for the Xbox that was lacking titles in this genre. Definetly worth your money and definetly worth the wait.
1,Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i read every of these reviews and let me tell you, how can almost everyone give this game 5 stars. This game is so bad. you couldn't even attack yourself. I thought it would be like jedi outcast . but it isnt and it is not fun at all!!!"
1,HORRIBLE GAME!!!!,"THIS GAME SUCKS ROYAL A**, April 21, 2004Reviewer: A gamer from dlakfj;dlfj,alskdfja;sdljthis was the most boring, stupid, idiotic game in the entire existance of games for the xbox, you would better yourself by playing games such as halo, or splinter cell: pandora tomarrow. This game mostly consists of running around talking to people and pressing a button so your character can go attack an enemy for you. You dont even control the hand to hand combat. Your character relies on a few key weapons but most of the rest are useless, the graphics are so so but the storyline consists of a number of choices you make which dont even change the storyline much, pretty much just the response of the people you talk to so DONT BUY THIS GAMEDITTO!!!!!!!!"
1,would be a great game if,"this would be a great game if it didn't screw up all the time.I have bought 2 now and both of them will not play correctly.when you go into a different part of a town or map and it has to load,the game does not load correctly or the xbox can't read the disk.so yeah I am more than a little disappointed."
2,This game is fun but sort of confusing,Though I like this game a lot I found that it is much better on the computer. Because of the keyboard the computer version has more freedom and doesn't have to fit all the controls on a xbox controller. So if you have a computer and xbox and want this game go for the pc version.
4,the freds,"Itwas a good game but was hard.I think ,if you like starwars you should rent it first.The grafics were great it was easy moving the lightsaber. But out of all you should tryrenting it first ,and I recamend also tring dark cloud to."
4,I liked it but to easy,This game was one of the best star wars games I have ever played but yet again this game was not up to par with some of the other games coming out today such as Halo. All in All i really like this game a lot. It is also not a badgame to add to your collection so dont be afraid to buy it.
4,Get it in STEAM for $5.00!,Title pretty much says it all. Great game but not worth $100!!!Get it in steam for a fraction of the cost.
5,Star wars kinghts of the old republic,Love the game one of the best RPG's of all time if you don't mind some old grafics and are interested a great rpg pick this one up totally worth the money and time!
4,Hey dont be dissin Drew Willy(william e.kelly)!!!!!!!,"Hey william, what did Drew do to you!!!He has his own opinion on this game.Its a good game I agree but my friend didnt do ANYTHING to you.And hey, did you look ''dome''up in the dictionary just to show him of his error?Your not a very Godly person to say you hate someone.He told me all what you wrote.You once again have a big attitude against someone with an opinion.Just so you know, this isnt really Drew writing another review again to counter yours once again:)No hard feelings William,just watch what you write to other people."
1,Horrible.......,I really thought this would be a good game at first but it turned out to just be one of the worst games ive probably ever played. Most of it is alright but the battles are the thing that mess the whole game up. Its really stupid. All you do is press A and watch the rest of the battle go on by itself. The game pretty much plays itself for you. I cant believe i wasted my money on this horrible game...
1,Star Wars,Not as good as a lot of people will tell you. One of the most challenging games I have ever played and it takes all the fun away from it. One of the worst games I have ever played.
4,I was blown away,"A friend of mine showed me this game and then I bought it the next day. You can talk to any body, all characters have a voice track. Only problem is that this is sometimes too much for the processor and the X-Box freezes. This also happens sometimes during the cut sceens. Other than that, This is a cool game."
4,OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH what a RUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Now to begin 1st off I would like to say that I am not a RPGgame kinda a fella, but this game is beyond any RPG I have played before, you looking at the game of the year for 2003 without a shadow of a doubt. I purchased an XBOX just to playthis game and it was worth every penny. KOTOR is a great game Hat's off to the Peep's at Lucasart and Bioware for puttingtogether an AWSOME game.MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Most Abysmal and Entoxicating Game in Today's Existence,"This game's unearthly complexity, dramatic storyline, stunning enviorments, and boundless personalities (I must mention that all these extremely powerful qualities are found on EACH and everyone of this game's MULTIPlE planets) nearly takes this game to reality. The moment you open the case... you open an entire other galaxy. This game takes your wildest dreams and creates a hero... a guardian. A Jedi Master. Or it can take your most demonic nightmares and create a rogue... a slayer. A dark lord. You chose to inflict fear, or to rid the galaxy of it. Your fate is in your hands. With them you grasp the controller... and you weild the lightsaber."
2,Not the great game experience most make it out to be,"It's a solid, full experience, but the fact that you're not taking any active role in the fights detracts from what otherwise is a fully realized world.Those looking for a Star Wars RPG will love this, as I'm sure many RPG lovers will. But after playing such Star Wars games as Jedi Academy, Bounty Hunter and Jedi Outcast, I was disappointed, that you couldn't just run in and start attacking foes with either a lightsaber or take aim and fire your choice of weapon. Rather, you can only target, and WATCH as your character slowly exchanges fire with enemies who don't move even an inch in any direction as you fire, duck, he fires, you fire, he fires, you fire, etc. etc. I've never been much of an RPG fan nor a fan of the Final Fantasy series which seems like the Holy Grail of RPGs, so perhaps that's why, the battle scenes disappoint me. Not a game worth buying for anything more than half of the original retail price."
5,Best Video Game Ever,This game was by far the best non-sports video game I have ever played. The only drawback was that the game ended...
4,Better than Bananas,"This Game Is Better Than Bananas, Great graphics, many many many in game choices, (get force persuade asap) Very deep story line that you may guess and be correct, (but i didn't expect THAT much) wahoooo go darth revan!"
4,satisfied,"I think it takes too long to get your lightsaber, and its hard to interact with and use everyone in your party, many ppl never even got used. But overall, no real complaints."
1,KOTOR BORING!!!,"This game is so boring I couldn't make it past the second level. You push a button, your character fights another character while you watch--you do nothing with the controls. Then you go around the flat and redundant landscape talking to the other ""in game"" characters who don't want to talk to you. BORING!!!"
1,not that good,when i bought this game i would give it a 5 out of 5 but on the 30 or 40th day it kept on stoping no matter how much i cleaned it.your going to say i did not take care of it but from the day i bought it i kept it in mint condition. but it still kept stopping.i gt a casing over it to make it work.but it still dose not work.and the disc was brand new.
1,THIS GAME IS THE WORST GAME EVER MADE!!!!,"THIS GAME IS THE WORST GAME I EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I COULD NOT EVEN GET PAST THE FIRST DOOR!!!! AND YOU COULDNT EVEN FIGHT OR ATTACK ENEMIES THE STUPID COMPUTER DID IT FOR YOU. I, MYSELF AM A HUGE STAR WARS FAN. BUT.... I BOUGHT THIS GAME AND RETURNED IT IN LESS THEN -IN 2 DAYS....DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.... THIS GAME IS AWFUL... THIS GAME IS ALSO A DISCRASE TO STAR WARS AND THANK GOD I GOT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! INCLUDIN TAX"
1,This game STINKS on ice!,"When I bought this game my friends told me it was going to be bad but i didn't believe them. I was my first game i ever bought on Xbox and whoa was it a disapointment. I really do not advise getting the game even if your curios! First of all you don't choose your attacks all you do is click attack and then wait and whatch you person die (this happens alot). Second I've had the game for a bought a month and there are still no lightsabers. The only ways you can customize your character is there class, which all are bad, and your ugly head, every head is ugly in some disformed way! DO NOT GET THIS GAME you will expierience TORTURE!!"
5,Derrick's Review,"With the Xbox starving for new and intuitive RPG's they have been scavenging for good games. We thought we had found a light at the end of the tunnel with Metal Dungeon. At least until we played it. Well now Xbox has a savior. Kotor is the greatest RPG to come along in years, not only is this a reason to buy an Xbox just to play this game but now Xbox is starting to set a standard with RPG's. Out of all the games you should own if you have an Xbox there is Star Wars: Kotor, Halo, and Splinter Cell. Don't miss this game. Do yourself a favor and go pick it off the shelves now."
2,An interesting game,"Its gameplay is okay and it has a good plot but it disipointed me in the fact that you cant control youre fighting you just watch youre character get his ass kiked. Also i was looking foward to getting the lightsaber and fighting with it, but it sucks. you cant chop any1 in half (one of my favs in all other star wars games) and a f**king dagger can block your lightsaber beacause of its metal. Overall I'd say this game has an okay plot but if youre looking for a good fighting star wars games like me i suggest you skip this and go to Jedi academy which is my favorite game of all time"
3,"Excellent game, but don't bother buying it.","Star Wars: KOR is an addictive game, but has absolutely no replay value. Rent it for a week, beat it, and move on."
2,Yawn...,This game is sort of fun and the graphics are pretty good but the overall combat and storyline is pretty lame. The gun shots are automated and you can't evade by yourself. Overall I wouldn't buy this game and I don't think that you should buy this.
4,The only thing bad is combat,"I bought this game as soon as i heard how much chices you had. Building a charecter, as well as your own light saber having two sabers or a double i thought awesome. I bought it got it home and played it all night. The only thing i found lacking in this game is the combat system. If they would have canged that then it would have gotten a five from me. It took me about 23 hours to beat. But that is letting the game sit idle while i go off and do things. I recomend this game to anyone that loves star wars and can handle a bad combat system."
4,The Best game Ever-,This game is so great you don't even have to like STAR WARS to love it! Once you start to play you can't put it down. You can play it over and every time do things completly different. I think this game is a mut have;)! The charaters you meet up with are great and can add extra plots to follow.
4,One of the Best games for any Console Ever!,All of the previous reviews have said it more eliquently than I care to right now. The game is simply fantastic!
4,Not a horrible game,"This game was one of the best rpgs I hadever played, until my character reachedlevel 20 and I couldn't get any strongerwhat a stupid idea, to limit the strengthof the characters, rpgs are very much aboutgetting your character as strong as possible,and it's limited. And one more thing, howcome when I got my character as evil aspossible I still felt like a good guy?"
4,This game rocks,"This is one of the best Xbox games i've ever purchased. This game is fun and replayable. It is the first xbox game i've finished and immediately restarted playing. After finishing this game as a good Jedi, I had an incredible urge to go back and play it again as a Dark Jedi."
5,This Game is like an Interactive Star Wars Novel!,"Truly Amazing. The story is phenomenal and convicing enough to truly be part of the star wars universe. The graphics are beautiful, and there is a fantastic investigation of the philosophies of both the Good and Dark sides of the force. The game also gives you the power to choose the destiny of your hero and depending on your choices, as well as what gender your player is, can determine your oppurtunities as well as the course of the entire game. The game takes place thousands of years before Episode I in a Pre-Star Wars time, but it certainly brings back similar themes that help one understand the intricacies of Star Wars Epi. 1-6 far better. One can't help but image Governator(j/k) Palpatine reading the scrolls of history and reading this, and putting together his plan of using an army of Mandalorian clones to destroy and corrupt Jedi which is what happens in this game as well as Epi. 3. It's one of the best games I've ever played."
4,more fun than the movie,This game has very fun battles you can do. Graphic are great. The robots are well made. This game gives you a nice challange. If you don't like talking this has a lot of it.Too much repeating their history. They tell you the same thing over and over. You don't have to be one side you can choice good or evil. It is a game you can save it and come back you don't have to play for hours before you can save.Loved by my son JAcob age 12
2,PC users be careful...,"While the reviews for this are generally glowing, on the PC there are some technical issues which make this game a real headache. If you have less than a top of the line system, then don't even bother. If one spends any time on the Bioware forums, they will read hundreds of posts from people who purchased this game and get it to run on system that were top of the line six months ago. It's simply ridiculous.Several of us have actually had our $200 graphics cards fry after running Kotor for a few weeks. And when I mean several, I'm not talking about just a few people. In my case, it completely fried my graphics card to the extent that games which played superbly on their highest settings just a few weeks ago won't perform at all. Be careful."
5,GREAT GAME,I have played many star wars games and been terribly disappointed. I rented this game think it was going to been another easy game. I thought i could beat it in 2 days. i didn't even GET CLOSE. I had so much fun though that I just had to buy it. I have had it for about a year I still occanally play it.
5,overall great game,"the battle-mode is kinda weird when u get goin but as u get into it, it gets better. The storyline is pretty good with a suprising twist aboard the leivathen, but i dont want to ruin it. good graphics and sounds. This is 1 of the best games ive ever played, and ive play alot."
3,Great Game but a little bit wierd,So basically I bought this game 3 days ago and basically I just realized that this game is an MMORPG Game because you have to connect to XBOX Live in order to play this game. If you are playing it on the XBOX 360 you have to update it and basically you also need to connect to XBOX live in order to update it and you start playing immediately and I am not kidding I'm dead serious! So anyway I still think it's a good game but for those of you who have an XBOX 360 you got to make sure you are connected to XBOX Live and get some updates and everything. So anyway if anyone who has this game to play on the XBOX 360 you'll understand soon enough what I mean alright! I give this game a 3 out of 5!
2,It could have been so good!,"I was very excited about purchasing this game. However, almost immediately I found the game to be very linear. That is, you can't just go around and fight monsters that respawn. There are specific quests with NPC's, monsters, and droids which you can battle. There are several stopping points where you cannot proceed without a walkthrough, because the actions you must take to get past that point are very exacting and there is no room for error. One place like this is where you see a full grown rancor. Attack it and you die. There is a pile of rubbish nearby with about ten miscelanious items within. You have to activate the correct two items in the correct order or you die. I never would've figured this out without the walkthrough. Once you clear an area of enemies, new ones do not appear and the old ones do not respawn. The treasure items you find are fixed, as in there are no random ones. I was hoping for Morrowind and got something more like Final Fantasy."
5,str wrs,good game.i keep comming back to it to see what other charachters their arefun to see how charachters you create develop
2,this game is missing something,When you play this game you tell the character what to do and it does it fast enough that you almost think your actually playing but when you use a blaster you cant aim the game does it for you it gives you a choice when attacking of the attack type but if you dont tell the character what to do they will use a weak attack the good thing is you can set it so it wont pause after each attack.
4,Great,"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) is a great RPG. Its story, and combat are overall amazing.KOTOR tells a fantastic player-driven story. Characters are fleshed out well and each planet has its own set of issues. The best part about the story is that players are allowed to make choices that lead them on the path of the light or dark side. Ultimately the decisions players makes dramatically alters the course of the story.KOTOR's combat is really fun. Players can select a squad of companions each with his or her own proficiency. The player can upgrade his squad with a wide range of abilities and force powers for Jedi. There are unique enemies on each world.KOTOR is worth it; it is a great game."
3,disc was in horrible shape,"when i got it, the disc was scratched pretty badly. i have had problems with it freezing up and the cut sceens not working"
4,This game is great,this game is awesome. just as I remember it. The only problem I've had is is that the sound effects cut out every once in a while but that might be my xbox opposed to the actual game
1,great grafics but game play sucks!,i was at best buy and i saw this game i thought it would be so coolto have a star wars game. but when i got home i played it and during the begining the grafics looked great but when i got to the fighting it sucked all you do is pick a target and the computer does every thing else and there is a bad game.DON'T BUY IT.
3,Yes ... it's good.,"This is a colorful, immersive videogame based around the Jedi Knights of the Old Republic. It's a detailed, overly-long but well-made RPG. You can assemble a group of Star Wars creatures on your team and run around the galaxy. Or take tiny races on a pod, but it's more like a chore. The dialogue is often dry despite the comments you can choose, a lot of the aliens go on and on about pride/loyalty and boring [stuff] like that. One thing I found dumb and unoriginal was how this story takes place before Ep. 1, and yet the universe looks so much darker & grittier than even ESB. The Jedi haven't even been offed yet and everything is just as dirty as Vader's reign. Things look like a Babylon5 episode. A lot of the aliens are different colored versions of critters from the movies with names like Davik, Zaalbar, Juhani, etc. There was also glitching and a troubled save system. It's what you'd expect to get, at least --and that's the best we've gotten from Star Wars in years. =D"
4,Who needs final fantasy!,The is the best rpg i have ever played period! Deep story line with a lot of great character development. You can choose which path of the force to go with. Beautiful graphics. Cool lightsaber effects too!! This is the game of the year!
5,This is exactly how good it can get.,"Disclaimer: I assume that because you reading this box set review, you have more than a passing interest in this seminal band that formed the link from The New York Dolls and the Stooges to Guns n' Roses...The sound quality is nothing short of revelatory. The guy behind the remastering, Mika Jussila, is a bona fide miracle worker, and this fact alone was worth the price of admission for me. The box design and accompanying booklet are also fabulous.Another great thing about this box, that is lacking from ALL other Hanoi compilation releases out there, is the inclusion of material from Hanoi's last (and best) album, Two Steps from The Move.The box also charts the guys' solo efforts (Disc 4) unearthing a couple of VERY hard to find gems in the process.All in all, kudos for a job extremely well done. Quite definitive!"
1,"Waste of time, money, and effort.","I strongly suggest you do NOT purchase this item unless you have the time to waste finding out that it doesn't work. (Perhaps YOU will be among the lucky few who happen to get one that works?!? ) If you do purchase it, keep your package and receipt handy for when you need to return it later."
1,Don't purchase,"Although this seemed to be a descent purchase for 7 ports and ""flashy"" lights, I discovered that it does not function properly. I have windows Vista and have used other 3 and 4 port hubs with no problems. To even get this to work, I had to plug in each item one at a time as windows recognized them. After a re-boot, only some USB items would work. I'd unplug and re-plug in the unresponsive items on the port and nothing would happen. Unplug the port iteself and windows went back to re-installing device drivers all over again. I moved things around a couple of times and my PC would hang at bootup! Re-connected original 3 port hub and NO PROBLEMS. I will be taking this back and talking to Q-stor for sure!!"
4,Would give it a 5 but for the lights,"I have had this for about a year and it has worked flawlessly with MIDI keyboards, external hard drives, USB pen drives, and so on. I also have D-Link 7 port hub. This works better than the D-Link for me."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is a terrible hub. I have quite a few of audio and MIDI devices plugged into it, a couple of which get their power from the USB port. No big deal, because the hub is plugged in--right? Wrong. If I have more than a few ports active, it will give an error message saying the hub is underpowered and the computer loses communication with all the peripherals plugged into the port.If this is going to be in your bedroom, you will not be able to sleep. The LEDs are very bright, and not even cool looking. It just blinks in a long pattern, and it will reflect off of your walls and keep you awake.Go with something a little more expensive."
2,Black paint not included.,"For the moment, this hub seems all right. It's perfectly functional, though I had to disable ""wake on usb"" by moving some motherboard jumpers in order to power on my computer once I plugged this in. However, there is one reason and one reason alone why I would not recommend this item. BRIGHT, OBNOXIOUS, FLASHING LIGHTS. There are 8 *bright* LEDs in all, one at each port (always illuminated, whether or not anything is connected), and one inexplicably in the middle. The 7 port-specific lights, though pointless, are benign. However, the middle light likes to blink in random (random as in not related to traffic, but it has its own preprogrammed pattern) sequences incessantly. Everything stays on, and this light stays blinking, as long as there is power connected to the hub (whether or not there is any traffic). I'm thinking of painting this hub black... then it would do the job quite nicely. Turning it upside-down reduces the irritation significantly, but not entirely."
4,Good but not great,They game is sort of fun. This game was fun the first time I played it but now its boring. For one thing it's too easy. Another thing there's not that many people to choos from Back Yard baseball is way better.
3,O.K. but the computer games are much better.......,"This is an okay game but there are a few problems...PROBLEMS1. it's pretty darn easy even on the HARD level.2. you can get a touchdown just about every drive3. you can intercept just about every pass4. gameplay is too slow5. The graphics are not too greatGOOD STUFF1. You can create your own player2. You can create your own team3. It has some pro players and still the backyard kids4. There are different stadiumsWell, thats all. The backyard games are better for other systems though so check those games out if you have PC or Game Cube."
3,This game rocks.,"At first this game is too easy. But it has a lot of depth, you can create your own characters, or just pick up a game and play. The fun is in changing around your offensive and defensive playbook and in trading players to try to beat your opponents even better than you do. It's satisfying to win. I'm sick and tired of games like crash bandicoot that just get insanely difficult to win while getting all of the boxes, gems, and apples. I'm sick of playing the last boss of metroid fusion 100 times and still being defeated. I'm sick of having to conserve my bullet-time on Max-Payne only to waste it accidently right before a big battle with no way to replenish it without taking hits. So yeah, as far as Gameboy Advance Games go, Backyard Football Rocks."
1,Check the fine print.,"Just a friendly word of warning -- these are new stereo recordings by one or more of the original artists. These are NOT the original recordings. If you are just looking for the tunes, this is a fine collection. If you are looking for the original sound recordings, sadly, you will need to search elsewhere. I didn't buy it on Amazon and didn't have a chance to read the fine print on the cover; sure wish I had!"
2,A popularization,"This book portrays Marshall's life in the form of a novel and is therefore suspect. It also gleans secondary sources only. If you want to know more about Marshall than what you might find in ""Reader's Digest,"" start with Mosley's book ""Marshall."" The main virtue of Faver's book is that it's a quick read."
1,Excellent film,"I know I rated this picture just one star, but I just wanted to be next to those who rated it the same. Ken Burns is a master story teller. If you want ""just the facts"" go to the library. I don't know why he catches flack from some people, but I guess it's their lose. It's hard to believe you could be so wrapped up in a story about any historical figure. I only wish my teachers and proffesors could have kept me this intrested. Amazing."
5,The Essential Documentary about Mark Twain,Anyone who loves Mark Twain will find this documentary vital to understanding the man and his time. Another Ken Burns masterpiece.
4,Ken Burns does his bit for Mark Twain,"If you've seen anything by Ken Burns, you know his formula, and you will not see anything different here. But the formula is good, and it works.If you don't care about Mark Twain, this probably won't capture your attention, but if you have read Twain and are a fan of him, as I am, this bio will do a great job of putting Twain's works into the context of a life that was remarkable in so many ways. The thing I most learned from this that I didn't know before had to do with the extent to which Twain's life was marked by personal tragedy, and thinking through the extent to which the appeal of his material is because it is comedy that is not glibly funny, but is marked by the gravitas of someone who knows life is hard. That to say you will understand Twain better for having watched this, and I recommend that you do."
4,Live!!!,Burns has talent at making history come alive as if you are watching it live. His choice of using Mark Twain is without question great and the whole film (as i viewed on PBS) was excellent and i looked forward to the next night's episode.I also think that Burns' filmaking has not really changed at all. Its almost the same as the Civil War. I guess there is only so much you can do with archival footage but i would like to see him go out on a limb and do something inovative in his next major project.Twain is definately worth the money though an excellent story of a real person that embodies the fiction he created.
4,one of the best angel books,I thought this was one of the best ones in the series so far. I like the old lady's character in the storyline. The fight scenes were really good. I think Jeff Mariotte is one of the best Angel/Buffy writers so far.
2,"Works, but wouldn't recommend","I originally bought it for my car, and found that the sound quality was pretty lame. Most of the fault wasn't on the product since I couldn't find a clear enough station but the 1 or 2 I did find, it was still pretty bad.When left on top of a stereo it works pretty well but it's not for purpose I bought it for."
2,Garbage.,"This FM transmitter is horrible.It doesn't fit the bottom of the iPod well and falls off breaking the connection. It's also twice as thick (making it hard to put down on a flat surface when connected).The audio output level is horrible, and since it's connected to the dock, the volume on the iPod doesn't seem to matter. Putting the transmitter on the dash just inches from the antenna (through the windshield) didn't make any difference."
3,Come on guys! You can do better!!!,"Brooks and Dunn are my favorite group but have fallen short on this CD. I love How Long Gone- it is Brooks and Dunn. The other released singles are very weak. They are not a good slow song duo, they are much better when they rock. Hopefully this is not a trend."
4,Dunn to sing all future songs.,Brooks and Dunn are the best duo goin'. Its a shame they do not win all the duo awards. I have bought everything they have out. The only way they could get better is for Ronny Dunn to sing all their songs. He is the glue holding this team together. Ronny you must know this to be true.
4,"Gams, Boots, Stockings, Garters & In-Charge Women","Benedikt Taschen is going boldly where no quality publisher has gone before. EXOTIQUE is a collection of the late Leonard Burtman's quirky, fetish journal of the 1950s. Burtman's imagery is a life spring of outrageous gams, tight-fitting boots, garters, stockings and take-command women. A must for the fetish collector. But not a trivial amount of cash to slap down on the table."
2,sophomore curse,"I thought The Pleasing Hour was a gem, so this follow-up came as a real disappointment. The plot itself is intriguing, and it kept me reading. But the writing is often clumsy and even amateurish, reminding me of the style in which The Lovely Bones was written. Reading it was like listening to an out-of-tune piano. I sensed the author's eagerness to devastate us with pithy, profound observations and insights, but ultimately, the characters and the story itself rang false. Still, reading it did inspire me to pick up Tess of the D'Urbervilles again. Through the main character, the author gave me much more insight into Hardy's book than my own English teacher gave me in high school. I should add an extra star for that!"
4,Well Written,"The book was a gift. I listened to it on tape, and didn't know which way it was going. It was smart and insightful. Fascinating. I had no idea how she was going to end it; pull it all together. I found the ending acceptable and bought two for gifts."
1,It is not for the cx2,"When I purchased a CX2 for my husband this last holidays, this blades were sold together with it. They don't belong to the CX2 and as soon as my husband broke the first blades, this was a disappointment since he was sure that I had bought replacements."
3,It's only a game,"It's a game, it hasn't even come out yet, so why is there this need to jump on a soapbox and preach? Please; war, famine, disease, abused kids, and a million other horrible things are out there for people to get worked up about but no a video game is more important. Do christians have nothing better to do than this? Whine about hell being more frightening that a game? Come on walking down the street at night is often more frightening than and kids toy. Get a life and review the game not your personal little beliefs.I'm looking forward to getting this game, it looks interesting has some nice innovative features like the interchangeable characters aspect. It also uses a ""real person"" for the heroine, a housewife, a bit like Silent Hill. As I have not yet played it I gave it an average three star rating."
5,Interesting...,"After reading the editorial review, this game sounds interesting...but what's with the lack of information on when it'll come out?By the way, my primary religion IS Christianity."
3,Been There,"I have actually been to hell and I am sorry to report that this game really doesn't serve as a substitute for the real thing. While it has many likeness of the netherworld (like fire n' stuff) it isn't like Satan's palace. hell is actually very close to Albequerque. It is hot as all get out and the people are extremely hard to talk to. Imagine having to sit and talk to someone talk about yarn for an eternity. Now imagine being in New Mexico. Yes, they are the same.Um, the graphics were good. Demons are cool."
4,"I know this game is not out yet,but.....","I think this game looks pretty cool,and the mature theme is very catchy,but let's face it......the storyline is pretty cheesy.First off,I think WAY too many people here on earth underestimatethe power of Hell/demons.To think that a housewife could just be strong enough to enter(and survive)Hell as she pleases is just laughable.Come on video game companies,I know you want to expand on the whole horror-survival franchise,but the aspect of Hell is alot stronger and more horrific then you could depict or have gamers believe.Some things just aren't meant to be put in video games...."
4,"a Good Albertasaurus, Take it or leave it","Albertasaurus is a cousen of the ever popular Tyrannosaurus Rex, and this figure is the perfect replication of it, as it stands on its own two feet with its tail above the ground, and not being dragged, like alot of dino toys tend to do.as a reminder, This, along with the rest of the Carnegie Collection is not met for rough play, and it will break easely if its subjected to such abuse."
2,size,the size of the toy should be incorporated with the price. the item is too small. i'm not very satisfied
3,incorrect scale,"The carnegie albertasaurus was supposed to be 1:40 scale but appears MUCH smaller. the quality of the figure is far behind the dinosaurs made my schleich, papo, and procon yet is roughly the same price as their dinos. this figure was small, looked cheap, and not worth the price of it. i give it 3 stars."
4,Funny absent-minded romance.,"I'm a big fan of Laura Kinsale's romances, but not all of them. This one is on my winner column. Midsummer Moon made me laugh on several occasions. It was almost like watching a Lucy/Ricky ""I love Lucy"" where the heroine, Merlin, is absent minded and not aware of her dangers to her circumstance but pursues her passion of creating a flying machine with utmost diligence, while the hero, Ransom, who is trying to do right with her, can't help but be terrified and appalled by her antics. But, he is unrepentedly devious and works to curb her ""nutty-professor"" pursuits and tie her to him instead.Then there's the hedgehog who is unforgettable in his own right.Midsummer Moon is a fun and funny romance full of antics and a memorable cast of characters."
4,Really good read!,This is a really good read with engaging characters and a story that draws you in and holds you to the end. One of the better books I've read in a long while.
2,Irritating heroine,"I have the hardest time wishing that I could at least push the heroine down a cliff. Frankly I don't think there's enough chemistry between the two characters. The romance seemed to be very one sided, with the hero pining after Merlin while she becomes increasingly, irritatingly obsessed with her damned aeroplane."
5,A Story to treasure again and again,"I read this book for the first time several years ago and keep returning to it as a favorite. The charactors are charming, I fell in love with them all, and would like a follow-up story on Ransom's brother and his romantic trials with his wife. I especially liked the relationship between the brothers, who struggle with love, competition, jealousy and personal growth. The story also brings out one of the true, but often neglected aspects of loving someone; fear. When you love, you must allow the freedom to take risks, even at the cost of your own terror for them. For its humor and charm, this is the best of Kinsale."
5,Amazingly Talented !!!!,"I recently saw Miri on Showtime at the Apollo. My daughter and nephew are hooked, age 13 and 15. Miri Ben Ari creates a whole new appreciation for jazz and a violinist. She has a remarkable talent!!! We have never seen anyone make music with the violiin like this before. You will be in absolute Ahhhhhhhhh !!!! She is a Talent that demands to be recognized. You will only regret not listening to this beautiful way of making music with the violin !!!"
1,Not sure what it is,"Arrived broken, but it doesn't seem like the product ever had a chance at moving on it's own.Seller considers it so cheap, just refunded me on the spot. The concept seemed fun, but you won't get it."
3,"Degrades sound a bit, but otherwise works well.","Works well in a very utilitarian way, but it definitely degrades the sound a bit compared to listening without it. It's still very handy for what I need it for. I don't know if there are different qualities of this kind of cable, but if you're getting it for a long-term installation and the audio quality is important, I would research it a bit first."
2,I'm in the minority,"I didn't have to read this book for a course, but I'd heard good things about it. What can I say? I finished it but it wasn't particularly interesting and a week after I finished it I couldn't remember what any of it was about."
3,A Sexist,"I had to read this book in one of my English literature classes. I find this man has some interesting things to say that our flesh and bodies are married together forming one unity. But he is a bit on the perverted side in mentioning that his cock is too hard in one chapter and that woman are like play objects. However, his theories are negative and a bit sexist. I do not see the point that he is trying to convey."
3,"Five Stars for Montaigne, One for Screech","Over the years I have kept a copy of the Essays by my favorite reading chair to be enjoyed at random, particularly in the middle of the night when Entropy seems to hold the upper hand. They exercise a remarkable calming effect.Seduced by the idea of having a complete set of all the Essays, I initially opted for the complete Screech translation, but found it wooden and pedantic. I moved to the Cohen translationMontaigne: Essays, which does not include all of the Essays, but has all of the major ones and is far more enjoyable."
5,Always have a good companion - Montaigne in your pocket,"Michel de Montaigne (1533 - 1592) was known in his own time as a statesman. He is known over the centuries since then as the influential author of over 100 insightful essays in which he wrote about life and ideas. The essays were first published in 1580. The first English translation was 1603 (John Florio). This inexpensive Kindle edition, copyright free, is slightly later, first published in 1685 by Charles Cotton. I have real, physical, editions of the Essays in various translations. I keep this edition on my Android phone as an ideal way to deal with time which would be wasted while waiting in lines or for appointments"
1,It's too good,"When this product arrived I noticed one thing right away. The strings sparkle way too much unless you are sponsored by Kesha. I had the strings installed anyways and the real problem shows up. My two normal racquetball partners look like trash now. Before they were certainly nothing to look at but the power shift is substantial.When Anakin Skywalker walked into the Jedi Academy and smoked all those jedi children, yeah its like that. Only the best may wield this string with the necessary control, otherwise the darkside shall rule. That is all."
4,Pretty good--could have been better,"I saw this concert on MTV and taped it. So, I know that they left some songs off of the CD that could have been and should have been on it. They are: One Hundred and Ten In the Shade, Bring It Down the Jellyroll and Walking in a Hurricane. Walking in a Hurricane is among the best hard rocking songs that Fogerty ever wrote so it's a big omission. Also, it would have been nice to have the 1 minute band introduction. I think that Reprise Records omitted Walking in a Hurricane so that you'd have to buy Blue Moon Swamp to get it."
4,A great trip back to my teenage years...,"John Fogerty has one of the most recognizable sounds in rock music. If you are an old CCR fan, this CD will be a great update for your music collection. I had forgotten how easily some of the songs make me smile. Great travelin' music. Fire up your CD player and hit the road. You won't be disappointed."
2,OK,"After listening to Premonition, I have come to a conclusion, John Fogerty should stick to his new songs. His voice doesn't have the old CCR growls. The rhythm part of those tunes cannot be matched by none other than Stu on bass and Doug on drums. He still needs that ""something"" that was lost in 1972. His new tunes seem to fit his vocals at this time, however, when singing the original songs that got him where he is today, he doesn't seem to put his heart into making them sound as great as before."
2,John at his less than best,"Fogerty goes through the motions with his CCR tunes and his own solo works, producing little more than a live version that could have been made in a studio with a canned crowd track. Banter in between songs is rehearsed sounding, and there's no good jams a la early Creedence Clearwater here.Worse yet I forgot this CD and bought it again months later, being so excited to get a chance for a Fogerty album of any kind!"
3,The sound was not recorded in high quality.,"I actually bought this record for my dad as a gift. He said that the record itself is not very good in quality on sound. It was very difficult for me to check over this internet due to the sound system that I have on my laptop is not as good as the one my dad is playing the CD. Anyway, overall we are happy on what it is right now."
3,good but the orig. is still better,I'm an 18 yr. old fan who's grown up on CCR. Although Johns new album is good(it sounds good with his curent voice)it lacks somthing all the CCR albums had. They al had songs that stood out and John sang his heart out. He just doesn't seem to put his all into it this time.
3,pleasant but not creedance,"Have seen or listened to both cd and concert both seem canned and from the same can. I love CCR and JF, but would like to see a little diversity"
5,From an old CCR afficianado,"Great CD !! Susie_Q and I put a Spell on you really rock.. Biggest let down is that they didn't include ""110 in the Shade"" from the same concert"
5,A truly master collection of rock & roll (5 stars plus!),"All I can say is ""Wow""! As a diehard rocker fan of the 60's-80's, Preminition is the best collection of songs I have ever heard (no let downs in this one). The music and lyrics are clean, crisp and have a drive that will keep your foot pounding on the floor! Regardless if your not an avid CCR fan, the music will sweep you away and you will find yourself singing the songs in the shower!!!"
4,John Fogerty singing and playing great music.,"Perhaps the best of John Fogerty's albums, Blue Moon Swamp pales in comparison, and Centerfield is close. This is a great album. Who couldn't enjoy Fogerty bringing the CCR album back to life with this album. Some of the CCR songs on this album are Susie Q., I put a Spell on You, Who'll Stop the Rain, Down on the Corner, and others. It also has track from Centerfield album, including Centerfield and Old Man Down the Road. In reality this CD is just a John Fogerty greatest hits album."
3,"Sounds good, not very loud though","After I finally got it installed in my 2006 Ford F-150, I tuned it, and it just isn't as loud as i'd like it to be. I can still tolerate it and have it play, but it just doesn't get loud enough for my liking."
5,2006 Ford Mustang.,"I put this in my wife's 2006 Ford Mustang with the Shaker 500 radio in it. The insulation took me about 2 hours, be sure that you adjust the volume on the unit before you reinstall the radio. After I got everything adjusted the unit works great and I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to hook up their iPod to their Mustang."
5,Works as advertised,"The PIE FRD04-AUX/S worked perfectly on my 2006 Ford Mustang with the Shaker 500 radio. The wiring harness matched exactly with my factory system and was truly plug and play. The most difficult part of the installation was taking the dash apart (though good instructions with pics are easy to find online) and working within the tight space available behind the radio. Great product, really nice that it fully integrates with the factory radio and makes the ""Aux"" button active."
5,Works great,"Exactly as advertised. Works great and easy to install! Sounds great, cd quality sound. Best way to get rid rid of that fm transmitter!"
4,works great,"product works great and would like to recommend it to other people. Fairly easy to install, the only bad part there isn't much room behind the dash to store the box converter, but other than that great item."
4,Great Sound!,The sound is MUCH better than RF modulators. Installed in a 2006 Mercury Milan in about 90 minutes. It took the radio a few power cycles before it recognized the module.
4,Auxiliary hook up,"The auxiliary hook up works good, i hook it up to my iPhone all the time and it sounds very clear. The only thing that I didn't like was when I tried to hook it up my self there was two wires that I had to hook up, a power and a ground. I wasnt able to hook that up my self .so I took it to a stereo shop and they were able to hook it up reel fast. They charged me $ 25.00 so that wasn't that bad. After I heard my sounds. I was a happy camper."
2,its ok,At first the right channel didn't work and then it started to work. I left a message with the company and had no response. I also get some interference.
2,Another unlistenable entry,"Frought with the same kinds of musical mistakes as his first record. Combining poetry with music is always tricky business. A lot of people think it looks awkward, and more times than not, a lot of poets don't nail down the right music for their messgae. Sundiata continually hits us with stock folk/blues music that doesn't seem to go anywhere on its own, and the poetry suffers for it."
5,Christmas 'Piano' CD,This is by far the best christmas cd I've listened to. It has all of my favorite songs on it plus more. It is so beautiful. I've bought several christmas cd's over the past few years and each cd I bought left me wishing for something more. Christmas Piano cd will be playing in my cd player every holiday for years to come.
1,"Thanks, but no thanks","I received this cookbook as a gift and I just finished looking through it (I'll be trading it at the used bookstore). There isn't one recipe I'm interested in making. Many of the recipes call for ingredients like butter spray, butter buds, and fat-free cream cheese, sour cream, and grated cheese. Also, there's lots of Jello, Cool Whip and canned pie filling. I'm not a big fan of fat-free because it rarely tastes good; I'd rather use low-fat and eat less. Even substituting low-fat dairy for fat-free doesn't make these recipes sound better. If you usually cook using these types of ingredients, this book could be for you - it's just not my style. Sorry Dawn, you seem like a nice lady! Take a look at the cookbook 'Desperation Dinners' if you want quick, healthy AND TASTY recipes. It's one of my favorites."
2,Recipes are mundane,"Although there are several recipes in this book are interesting, the manjority are mundane and not very exciting.It looks like Ms Hall went to the grocery, looked on the back of every package in the store and then bought the products that had recipes on the side of the can or package. She then copied them down and put them in a bookMy advice is to pass on buying the book and go yourself the grocery and do the same thing."
1,"Bland, boring recipes","Dont waste your money. This book is full of tasteless, boring recipes that are just plain awful. The author praises herself in describing each one like you have never tasted anything better. While reading the intro, I found it quite funny how she states that she has no education, but decided to home school her kids. I wouldn't run around bragging about that."
2,Quick and Lowfat but not Healthy,I am a little disappointed by her consistent use of chemically filled nonfat products. The recipes might be lowfat but they are not good for you or nutrient filled.I just thought it would be a mix. I feel the need to alter every recipe to make it better for my body...
1,Very disappointed,"My husband needs a low fat diet. Cans, boxes of stuff to cook and throw together. Not real food in my opinion. The book is way overpriced for what it is. Still, I have to give the author credit for coming up with a way to support herself. I wish her luck but I wouldn't buy anything else she writes about food."
3,Just OK,"We bought this book because my husband had some health problems and was required to maintain a low fat diet for many weeks. I found that while this book does contain some overall decent recipes, it does what many diets do which is ignore the big picture. For example in a recipe for oatmeal, the author uses half a can of ""fat free"" sweetened condensed milk. Well, two tablespoons of fat free sweetened condensed milk have almost 30grams of sugar. I'm not convinced that dessert recipe's that call for ""fat free"" frosting which is going to be loaded with sugar is really doing your body any favors. It was fine for our needs at the time but we will definitely go back using healthy fats like olive oil and nuts and stay away from the chemically processed ""butter"" product that Dawn uses as a substitute."
1,"Low-Fat, but high sugar and junk",The recipes use a lot of processed food ingredients and sugar. It's very deceiving. You usually equate low-fat with healthy. The front even says it's healthy for your heart. I beg to differ. I wasn't able to find one recipe in there that I wanted to make.
3,Mediocre.,"""The Journal of Professor Abraham Van Helsing"" interested me because I admit to being entertained by the movie ""Van Helsing."" I knew that the movie character had very little to do with the literary character, so that was no surprise to me. I never read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" so I had no background of the character in any form but the movie. The way author Allen C. Kupfer approached this book was interesting, and it was about the only thing that was. I enjoyed the journal style, but I yearned for more than what was given. Better descriptions and less dialogue. I also wanted to know more about the pictures that were drawn - who they were, mainly. I can deduce, but I wanted to know more. If you're looking for a quick read, with not much to it, then this is sufficed. I ""sorta"" recommend."
4,A fun easy read,This book has nothing to do with Bram Stoker's Dracula or with the cheesy Van Helsing movie. This book is supposedly a real journal of a scientist named Abraham Van Helsing who gets caught up in a country's vampire infestation. If you like vampires you'll get a kick out of this book.
2,Sometimes things are better left alone.,"Although I commend the author on his innovative idea of finding Van Helsing's diary, I was dissapointed in this book. I recently read Bram Stoker's Dracula (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) and found that:The journal does fit with the personnality of Stoker's Van helsing;The story was short with some far fetched ideas (yes, even for a vampire book)And the language of this so called found journal sounds like it was written in the current century, not the late 1800's.So, I was dissapointed in it.Just my thoughts."
4,Fun read!,"I thought this book was just plain fun & interesting to read. I always read these sort of books in October, & this is definitely one I will read again."
4,Great Bedtime Story!,"Good read for a rainy day. Nice adult fairy tale. The book could be believed by some who love the vampire stories, but once into it, it becomes less believable, though it still continues to hold the reader's interest and imagination to the end. Plus the book ends on a rather sad note for Van Helsing.An entirely different contrast from the movie Van Helsing, who fought to the very end and killed the head vampire. The Van Helsing in this book either ran scared or was killed. The book leaves that to the reader's imagination."
3,How this game is tight and how it ...,"I just got this game for my birthday (Nov 26) and it is okay. Its not great but its ok. What i hate about it is the music,how the cops easily find and ram you,and how you cant stop your car and get out to find another car while the cops chase you. I think when they make Driver 3 it should be way more like GTA3 and GTA VICE CITY. This game needs improvement I give it a rating of 3."
2,Driver 2 drives me crazy!,I got this game from a friend because he hated it also. The storyline is alright. I found the music quite annoying. The graphics give you a head ache thats its not even funny. Its hard to control. I am glad I did not buy it myself. There are much better games out there for you to get so don't waste your time or money on it.
4,"Fun, but not the greatest","I have this game, I bought it used and it is a real great game and all, but it just can't compare with GTA3. I hope that GTA3 on GBA will look like this game only better sprites. It looked like the developers started off really well and then got bored or something. I was hoping that you could at least go into buildings or have a pistol with the ""L"" button. I am only on the 9th level and I was wondering if you really get to drive a tank (if so, can you shoot with it)."
3,Umm not quite what I was lookin for.,I don't think this game deserves to have of been released when it was. It has very poor graphics and is nothing like the original for gameboy color. I also would recommend to not buy a gameboy advance because of the poor graphics in the games I have.
5,I have loved the songs of the Hi-Lo's for 46 years.,"I first heard the Hi-Lo's when I was 16 and now I am an old lady of 62. The fantastically close harmony, high humor and fine choice of tunes of this most exceptional of exceptional has kept me a fan even though they have not recorded for some time. Their work always brings tears to my eyes. I have every album that they made and treasure them all."
2,"Interesting, but no feeling","So many words, so little feeling. There are plenty of harrowing battles and many (definitely too many) changes in scenery; but it feels like so much hot air because the characters are flat, dull, and cliched. I couldn't put the first book down, however, I can't seem to finish ""Queen of Demons."" Skip this book, and try Ursula Le Guin's ""Earth Sea"" series if you want exciting plots AND characters you care about."
5,Very Satisfying,I found this book to be very enjoyable; there are almost too many possibilities for the direction of the story to take from here. Drake is very good at juggling the multiple threads as characters separate and rejoin.
1,Disappointing!,"After a promising start in Lord of the Isles, David Drake has given us a confusing, hackneyed sequel that makes me wish I had never started the series. It is another ""quest"" story, where an ill-assorted group of characters get together to save their world from the forces of evil. The approach is common, but doesn't have to be as bad as this one has become. The members of the group find themselves in a series of difficulties that fail to either advance the plot or increase our knowledge of the characters. Why must all these authors write their stories in ever-increasing serials? David Eddings did it with humour, which made it worth while slogging through six books, and Robert Jordan is up to number eight, but at least his stories are interesting. Mr. Drake only succeeded in confusing the plot with his forays into other planes and apparent alternate realities. Dead characters reappear without explanation, or are replaced with thinly disguised doubles."
3,Good to borrow,"At first this story appears to have all the elements required for a good, satisfying read. As you progress you realize it's like a stew without the spice. Key elements that catalyze the whole are missing - notably a lack of emotional development in the male/female relationships, and a certain unidimensional feel to the main characters' thoughts as they decide on how to act in each successive situation (the third party viewpoint is too obvious?). The more I read, the more underwhelmed I became.This is still worth reading for fans of the genre, and it has enough detail & depth to be considered ""read if you have the opportunity"", but certainly it is not a ""must read"". Borrow it from the library or a friend, or at least wait for the paperback."
2,Sin Maria Luisa no va pal baile,"Esto no tiene sentido, como que Maria Luisa no esta. Asi no vamos pa ningun lado con este CD. Tiene otros clasicos, si, pero como el que les nombre, ninguno."
3,Same Old Stuff,"The crew at ASB have once again made very few changes to the game. But it's still a OK game. They haven't added many features to it. It still has the Serious Error Come up when you are playing a game. So if you like this title then get it, but if you don't like error messages coming up and have new more features I would go with MVP Baseball 2004 by EA Sports which has the best Sport Games!"
1,not any better than the last one,i mean cmon acclaim you cant get any better ok the graphics are better but the glitches are the same like where you dive for a ball ten feet away and it transports in to youre glove its just sad if you want a good baseball game for the year 2004 you should get MVP baseball 2004 thats the best baseball game on the market right now if i were you i would not get this game if you get this game im telling you youre wastin youre money
5,best baseball game out there,"hands down. the most important attribute is the gameplay. it's the most realistic out there, which makes pitching and hitting fun. the discrepancy in the speeds of different pitches (eg fastball - changeup) makes the game. pedro is deadly in this one... still not as good as Baseball Stars for the original NES, but 2nd best for sure."
2,"Oh yea, this is so much fun..","After playing this enough I notice that regardless the difficulty level and what team you've chosen and who your opponents are, hitting and fielding usually favors the computer, whereras it's a chore for the human player to hit the ball with any kind of consistency and as far as fielding goes it can be troublesome, when making a diving stop it takes forever to release the ball often resulting in baserunners beating out the throw or advancing to the next base with ease. Sports games should be based on a team's strength and weakness, not granting one side super capabilities and handicapping the other to the point where it's pointless even picking up a controller and bothering pretty much knowing you're going to be slaughtered again and again and again in this case.. yawwwwnnnn."
2,Just another baseball title.,"This is one of the poorer baseball titles out there. Get MLB Slugfest, WSB 2k4, or High Heat Baseball 2004 before you even consider this one. It's not good. You've been warned."
5,Simple yet functional.,"You set it and it will wake you up on time. No thrills, no snoozing. Great alternative to those who hate spending an hour setting up a clock radio and have it wake them up at 3 in the morning with the radio blasting."
2,Functional alarm clock but no light so can't see it in the dark,"I had a Casio alarm clock that had a button so you could turn on a light to see the clockface. I lost it so I ordered this one to replace it. However, it does not have a light so I can't see it in the dark."
3,An other colour...,"I've ordered this alarm clock from Chelsea Watch, but the item we've got does not have a black dial--as pictured. They sent us one with a white dial and black numbers, which is not as stylish me thinks. If you're looking for one with the black dial, as we did, consider buying it elsewhere."
1,No time for this junk!,"This clock is junk!! I bought this in August of 2011 and by early November 2011, it no longer works. I changed the battery but it still loses about 20 minutes every day. What good is that? Don't buy it."
1,No snooze alarm,I incorrrectly assumed that it had a snooze alarm. It does not. It is not a product that I would recommend.
1,Comment on Casio Travel Alarm,"This ""alarm"" clock is a fine travel clock for telling time. But it is unsatisfactory as an alarm clock. The low volume beeping noise is not loud enough for anyone to hear unless they are a very young person who has perfect hearing. For most adults, it is worthless as an alarm clock. A note should be added to the advertisement for this clock model that you must have perfect hearing to use this clock as an ""alarm"" clock."
1,No snooze!,"What a disappointment. This otherwise handy small clock has NO snooze function! True, it was not specified in the features, but to me it is so obvious - I basically didn't imagine an alarm clock could have no snooze! I paid 10 dollars for this and the seller will charge me 5 dollars to return it: not worth it, waste of money, and now I have to shop for a clock again. Not good."
3,Cute/functional little clock,"Smaller than I expected but it turns out that I liked the size which, of course would be great for travel. And the large, greenish numbers made it easy enough to see the time across the room. They seem like they might glow in the dark but don't really. Which was great for me because I didn't want any extra light in my room. However, I was mistakenly under the impression that this clock did not make a ticking noise. And, while it's quiet enough, in general, I can still hear it from 5 feet away while in my bed. And that's too loud for me."
5,Casio clock,"Great inexpensive alarm clock- last one I bought 1997, that's 14 years. My fault I broke it- pulled the alarm setting knob out too hard; felt like I injured an old friend. Now I have the new one and am very happy with it."
4,Full contact racing!,"I found the story amusing but at the end of the day this is a racing game thats fun. Handling isn't full sim, but also isn't arcade in any way. Adjust the car set-up and race with a wheel to beat the rest... but V8's combined with the Oz tracks are still lethal.Not as pretty as another PS2 racer I could mention, but with all the damage effects, nice framerate, mean opponents and thirty or so real tracks, I just don't care!"
1,The worst,I can't believe people actually found something in this game to play.It is not worth the money.Codemasters have got to go back to the drawing table.
4,don't judge a game by its cover,"I've been playing this for a while now (pal), and after a few early doubts (mostly about visuals and the handling takes some time to get used to)its grown on me alot. Don't buy it thinking its a 'spend money to tune your car' game. Its about racing against a field of very similar spec cars and some unpredictable AI (sometimes pasive, sometime raging!). Also with the range of tracks it helps to practice before a race because the same one won't come around that often.Race Driver doesn't quite feel classic Codemasters but give the controls a chance - this game makes the most of your analogue controller. At first it feels odd but listen to the mechanics advice, it helps alot. Overall its the unpredictable races that I've learnt to love - tyre bursts, pile-ups on a blind bends.... :)"
3,What are they talking about?,I have 3 words. Fast and Furious. What are they talking about?? It seems as if they copied off of the plot of the Movie Fast and Furious. Father Burns in accedent of car crash at track as he watches?? I think it's a copie of the plot with a little twist. But still the graphics are supposed good so i gave it a 3*.
4,"yes, the marraige of retro + futura","i agree. 80's sounds. 2000's mentality. weightless pop that lifts you -- driving in your car, alone, grey pop music on a sunny day. as if in a commercial. perfect. a song from this album will be in a car commercial.if you long for the 80's (smiths + cocteau twins + the cure + book of love) and like to sing in your car then buy this!"
3,Much better,"I think this is the best c-d they have put out. The previous one I would compare to any John Denver or Johnny Cash song; once you've heard one, you've heard them all. I was impressed with this album and would recommend it to others."
2,Disappointed.,"After all the hype about this album from the music press, I was ready to be blown away. Unfortunately, the whole record is so lightweight, so middle of the road, I couldn't even get through a first listen. I WAS SO BORED. This wasn't a fresh look at love, just a tired rehash of love's cliches. The melodies weren't even remotely inspiring, and the writing made me want to strangle them both. I think this may have been the single worst listening experience of my life, actually. I've never before halted a record without listening to it the whole way through, that's how bad it was. In a word, lack-lustre. Your money would be better spent elsewhere. (And, on a side note, what is the deal with the Smiths inspired album art, including the ripped off type face of their ""best of"" albums? Yeesh.)"
2,Is this a joke?,"The only reason I am giving this album two stars is because it didn't actually make me vomit. But I came close.This was one of the least interesting albums I have ever heard. The lyrics were banal, the vocals flat, the music simply devoid of invention. I knew it was going to be bad from the first few seconds, when each member of the band gave their name and said 'this is my heart.' I was right...it WAS bad.Apparently people seem to like this band in the indie circle but I do not know why. I do not recomend it to anyone."
4,Acquired taste CD. Somewhat disappointing.,"Above average with some strong weaknesses. This CD has a lot of haphazardly-written, awkward lyrics (Heart, Death to Death) that just don't work with the music-- but I suppose this is endemic, to some degree, of Stars' songs in general. Elevator Love Letter, which has excellent lyrics and develops quite well, is one of the best songs I've heard recently, and it's songs like this, ""Look Up,"" and ""Don't Be Afraid to Sing"" that make the CD for me.I was waffling between three and four stars, but I think I'm going to go with four. Some songs on this CD are almost there but aren't quite-- The Vanishing and Heart are examples. Stars' heavy emphasis on unnatural, electronic sounds seems to cloud out what would otherwise be musically pretty solid, and the lyrics that sometimes don't fit together properly seem to detract from the quality of the album."
3,Possible title confusion,"pywrit.com listed Superromance No. 160 as Shannon Waverly, Dear Villain. That appears to be confusion in both author and title, as well as series. Harlequin Presents No. 160 was Jacqueline Gilbert, Dear Villain (1976)."
3,If you don't know Warren Buffett this is a nice overview,"This book is a hodgepodge of information about a great man. There are lots of quotes and interesting facts about Buffett. If you already know him then there is little that is new here but it is still presented in an enjoyable way. The second half of the book is dedicated to his investing style with a lot of random stuff. For example, Lowe dumps material about Buffett's philosophies on charitable giving in this section.Overall, good coffee table book or a nice gift for someone perhaps. However, if you are serious in wanting to learn about Warren Buffett (especially his investing style) then I would recommend reading his letters to shareholders which is posted for free in the Berkshire Hathaway website in his annual reports. These are extremely interesting and enjoyable to read even for non-investors. What makes Buffett a great man is not just his skills and talent at making money but his philosophies on various other topics."
4,Thoughtful / Insightful Words of Wisdom,"Janet has collected and organized Warren Buffet's quotes into categories such as family, friendship, investing (the largest, obviously). Having these quotes in one place brings out the consistency and simple life principles in Buffet's philosophy. Reflecting on how you agree / disagree with the quotes, why, and under which situations will help increase common sense. There are several suggestions that can be usefully applied. For example, I can benefit from researching competition more thoroughly when investing in a company. The four stars instead of five are because I didn't find a major ""aha"" that would enable a paradigm shift."
1,Go to Warren's internet site instead,"This book provides trivial context free quotes from the Master. The context can be provided if you read the full text. (You may find you disagree with it in context.)Anyway, the Berkshire homepage (WWW.BERKSHIREHATHAWAY.COM) has a full set of Berkshire letters to shareholders. Read these instead."
2,Work of a lazy author...,"If being an author means collecting a few dozen quotes from various sources, sprinkling them with dry, useless opinions, and putting them together in an overpriced book, then I wager that anyone reading this can call themselves a writer.The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the quotes. Warren Buffett is the world's greatest investor, the second richest man on the globe, and one of the very few who chose to stay out of the internet boom and bust. While millionaires and billionaires were overseeing the fading of their paper fortunes, Buffett was getting richer.The many quotes offer an insight into the inner workings of Buffett, and that's really the only redeeming aspect of this book, if it can be called that. Whether your are a seasoned investor, a student of business, or someone looking to quote the words of one of the most brilliant men in the game, you will find value in this book."
5,Great Bathroom Reading,"I read the rest of these reviews below and was amazed at how little praise the author got for his creative collection of Buffett insight. I have read many books on Buffett and I like how this author has gotten the facts about Buffett out in a simple easy to read manor. I say it is great bathroom reading because you can just open the book to any point and read a few pages to learn about a certain section in Buffett's life. It is true that all of this info is found in other publications about Buffett, but this book is fun to read and teaches you about Buffett the man and what he has learned about life. I think it is a great supplement to the other books about Buffett and is a must have for anyone who is looking to emulate Buffett's life and success."
1,Random thoughts&#65533;,"This books should be called ""The random thoughts of a rich old man."" It appears to me someone followed Mr. Buffet around and wrote down what ever he said then thought ""how do I present this is a book?, oh how about a random collection of dis-jointed thoughts! yea that's it!!"""
4,Good Book,"Have just paged through it, read excerpts so far but see good information and guidance from Warren Buffet. Thank You"
3,Easy to understand quotes about life from a great man,"I'm a big Buffett fan, have been for decades now. Especially one has to respect him lately for expressing himself in ways that don't win a popularity contest. This book does not go deeply into the meaning of Buffett's thoughts. Also, I got the audio version and have not been inspired at all by the narrator's rendition. It's been difficult for me to hold my attention of this audio version."
5,Teaching Children To Read: From Basals to Books,I found this book very useful in helping me pass the Excelsior / Regents College Exam. Also useful was Literacy by Cooper. Both are available along with Regents groups of reading forsale under jring 47 - used for 49. I am selling all three together. I studied these three books and did very well on the test - just last month.
4,"Good, not ideal.","The exterior of the book is in good condition, but inside the text is flooded with highlighting and underlining. Other than that factor, the purchase was satisfactory."
5,Real Feng Shui by an authentic Master,"I run a Feng Shui consultancy in the UK employing several consultants - all Chinese who learned their skills from famous Masters like Grand Master Yap Cheng Hai of Malaysia and Master George Lau of Hong Kong. Reading this we were astounded by the depth and reach of Grand Master Sheng-Yen Lu's teachings. He covers things you'll see commonly in English like 24 Mountains and goes through into advanced Flying Star, Form school and out into profound Tao practices to change the flow of Qi. His knowledge is extraordinary and to see these secrets in English is rare. An easy and smooth read, if you've been reading up on Feng Shui then this will blow your socks off! I've got over 100 hundreds books in my library and there is simply nothing like this!!!"
5,What a wonderful book!,"What a wonderful book!After using the advice in the book, my husband found a job the very next day! I can look back now and see the reasons why certain things have happened where we have lived before.After reading many books on Feng-Shui with the many different techniques, none worked. This one did.Thank you for making this book so simple to understand and easy to use."
1,Not practical- just stories,"I was looking for a practical book. And I didn't want a Feng Shui book from some interior decorator trying to cash in on the trend. I really did think this would be a great book but when I opened it there were just stories of houses he's been to where people's opulence got in the way of good chi. Not a single illustration to guide you, just stories!There was only one chapter that I found useful about not placing items above your bed and I had not been doing that so really there was not much to gain from the book. I guess better to see inside a book than to go on a hunch based on the cover and some 5 star reviews."
5,Great dessert bowls!,These bowls are the perfect size for dessert bowls. I bought them along with the bread and butter plates to complete my Mikasa Antique White set.
2,Interesting premise--terrible writing,"I thought the concept for this book was good, but it really annoyed me at times. Considering the dearth of stories that give bisexuality a serious exploration, I thought it worth a try. It's not a slow read, but it was terribly written. Cliches abound and grammatical errors are frequent (and not in a ""poetic license"" sort of way--they're just dumb mistakes). If you're only looking for an interesting story, and the quality of writing does not affect your reading choices much, then this would be a fun book to spend an afternoon with."
1,"""Soar"" Bores","A coemployee recommended this book, because quite frankly, I am a heavy-handed manager who sqaushes my employees' strengths like cockroaches, while demanding they get better at what they are incompentent at. As simple as it is, I have always thought ""The Little Engine That Could"" taught the essence of success. Now, after reading ""Soar With Your Strengths"", I'm sure 'Little Engine' teaches the essence of success. Yeah, let's just blame everyone else for what we stink at and make ourselves feel better by only doing the couple things we're good at. This does happen to be real life, and the losers will be the commune hippies who toke doob and tell each other just how strong they are. Well, you weaklings just keep on talking to yourself in the mirror, as the rest of the world passes you by."
4,Soar with your strengths,This has been interesting and provides me a new point of view about takeing decision in terms of strengths and weaknesses.It is easy to read. I am not very good in english leguage and tor ead it was not a difficult task.
4,Good enough for me,"This book is a good read. I encourage those that like analogies to read it. It came a little more worn than expected, but still good for the price."
1,Worked but do not recommend,"Four problems: (1) the product did not include the 9-to-25-pin adapter shown in the picture; (2) the included driver did not work, though one downloaded from the manufacturer's web site did; (3) I paid for next-day service but waited about one week for shipment; (4) the product has integral female-threaded bolts that prevent use unless the mating DB-9 female adapter is flush with its mounting surface. The unit with which I wanted to communicate it also has projecting female-threaded bolts projecting from its mounting surface. Hmm. Removing the bolts from my unit loosens its DB-9 connector so that's no go. And, it doesn't appear possible to non-destructively remove the bolts from the product. So, in my application, a DB-9 male-female adapter was required. I don't expect to have to purchase an adapter in order to use an adapter."
4,Continued Tradition,"WordPerfect Family Pack 5 continues a tradition of great products bundled at a great value for the family. Focusing on everyone in the home from Mother to child, the applications puts lots emphasis on educations, with Electronic encylopedias and tools to type elegant reports and letters using WordPerfect. Quattro Pro for Spreadsheets."
1,Screwed,"No registgration card enclosed with this Corel suite, so I couldn't install it. If I were able to give this no stars I would."
5,I wanna do that!,"A great series. Now we just need ""By Any Means"" available for our region's dvd players!!!"
4,"Even if you dont ride, it is enjoyable at any age.","A real adventure worthy to classify this a ""Keeper"" in your collection. It inspires you to follow your dream. I recommend this for anyone."
5,Awesome adventure!,This is one of the most awesome dvd's I have seen. I have never wanted to join someone on a trip so bad. I have read the books as well and have enjoyed both. I love their spirit of friendship and I would highly reccomend these.
5,Freaking Amazing!!,"This is some of the most addicting television ever!! Motorcycle, Travel & Ewan McGregor lovers would agree that these DVD's rule."
4,Christmas gift for hubby,"I purchased this DVD set for my husband (BMW motorcycle enthusiast) as a Christmas gift. He has already watched all of the DVD's multiple times. I have even watched a few episodes with him:-) Hubby loves the footage as they prepare for their trips, info on their choice of gear, and traveling with Ewan and Charley on their journey. We would rate this five stars, with the exception of Charley's bad habit of cursing, and we are not fans of bad language."
5,A must have DVD,"These are such great adventures. Packed with such interesting places, people, and comedy that you'll find yourself refusing to stop watching till you've seen them all through to the end."
5,more than the Long Way Round,"Maybe I missed it, but it wasn't really explained that this included Long Way Down and Road to Dakar. That would have been nice to know, because then I wouldn't have ordered Long Way Down separately. Anyway, this included all three series so that was great."
2,Horrific language -- for adults only,"Many others have commented on the details of these documentaries, so I won't take the time. You should be warned, however, that this is not for family viewing due to foul language throughout. I'm a big fan of Ewan and this really bummed me out. If you have no qualms with filthy language, you'll love it. If you do, you'll be saddened."
5,All about the journey,"This was so much more than I expected it to be...a commentary on life, on travel, on adventure, on freedom, and on risk. This was an extremely moving journey. Thanks to Ewan and Charlie for undertaking this trek and letting us come along."
4,Addicting series,"I could not stop watching this. It is a great series. My only complaint is the language. Had these guys toned down the innapropriate language I could have shown this to my family and they would understand why I love to adventure tour. Had to watch it on my mini dvd with headphones on. Charlie Boorman, in Long Way Down, is even worse with the language."
3,"A great adventure, but too much swearing.","Excellent buddy video, Ewan and Charlie on a crazy round-the-world-on-bikes adventure.However...We enjoyed the first few episodes but had to stop watching because of the endless swearing.We're not prudes by any means, but seemingly every five minutes it's the F word, GD, Sh or JC, and it all just got to be too much.We'll give Long Way Down or Race To Dakar a look over. I'd love my kids to watch at least one of the series."
1,"Arrived in PAL format, not NTSC","I am a big fan of this series. I tried to buy ""Long Way Down"" in NTSC, and could not find any reasonable price for this product in this format. When I saw it in this collectors edition in NTSC, I thought I had my series and with ""Race to Dakar"" to boot! Unfortunately, it arrived in PAL format. I am returning and actually re-ordering 2 copies this time, hoping it was a mistake. More to follow..."
5,Will always be my favorite band,"I moved to LA/Orange county in 1987 from central California and one of the best thing at the time was Oingo Boingo. I've seen them in concert 8 times and everytime was just as good if not better than the last. The Alive album is a way to relive the concert sounds over and over, even after the Farwell tour. I'm also in the stage picture inside the CD cover. Greek Theater concert and I'm in the 3rd row."
2,The oringinal recordings are much better.,Anybody who is a real Oingo Boingo fan knows that this albums (is bad) The oringinal recordings of the songs were much better and a little faster why Boingo decided to make new recordings I'll never know. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Tom T.
2,"Cheap. The quality, not the price.","Oingo Boingo makes some seriously good records. Unless you're a hardcore Oingo Boingo fan (tough thing to be, now), you won't need this compilation of re-recordings. You probably don't even want it. Not all of the tracks included are worse than the album versions (they seem to be the way they played their songs live). Some good songs here are presented poorly. And actually, since Boingo often made better concerts than studio recordings, you're better off just getting their Live DVD or album. If you think you need a live recording from this era of Boingo, I reccomend seeking out a bootleg in trade or something. This isn't worth the money or time."
3,Well...,"It was...Okay. Ish. Kappei can sing, I'll give him that, but I couldn't hear Satsuki do her part as back-up in the first track at all. That was disappointing. I did rather enjoy the seiyuu commentaries and words of luck to Kappei at the end though. That was amusing."
3,Good Game As A Rental - 10-year-old completed in 3 evenings,"I bought Star Wars Clone Wars (ps2) for my 10-year-old son. While he does love the game he was able to complete it in only 3 evenings. He said it was easy but did have places where it was difficult. I realize this game is rated teen but he's played almost all the teen rated Star Wars PS and computer games. This one was the easiest for him. The redeeming aspect of the game is that it has two player games. He and his 8-year-old sister are really enjoying the two player games. I was personally very disappointed with the game because he was able to complete so easily and quickly. Unless you are into the two player aspect of the game, I'd save some money and just rent it."
2,Your average game.,"This game is simply O.K. The graphics are lame, and so is the plot. I would talk about it, but I know there are some people who just want to discover. Only the gameplay is good. The multiplayer is just weird. My final opinion: rent it first."
5,Good game for fun,"This is a great game but it dosen't teach u anything. Parents, the raiting is for teen but all it shows is ships blowing up. This is a great game for all starwars fans. :)"
5,"The Clone Wars have begun, and you're in the action","Jedi, tanks, gunships! What's there not to like? This game puts you right in the middle of the action of The Clone Wars. Drive your hover tank through the rocketing explosions of missiles and pulse lasers, then leap out and attack armies of battle droids with your lightsaber as Mace Windu (c'mon, you know you want to be the slickest Jedi ever), then climb into the Assault Gunship and take down Separatist spaceships as they try to take off while dodging laser fire from fighters. Pure adrenaline! I highly recommend it!"
3,Insert Game Here,"Graphics = OK, Sound = Excellent, Voices = umm, yeh, there are voices.Just another Star Wars game. Not great, but not bad. The voice acting is just as dry as the movie. The plot is way too extreme for the movies and pretty silly. and FPS modes are down right histerical. Your chacter looks like they are running while squeezing their [other] cheeks together (and that's being nice).Rent this one and save..."
4,An amazing game for it's time.,"This game is an amazing title. It has quite a few levels but if you have much gaming experience like I do it's pretty easy. Singleplayer, multiplayer, extras, and cheats, this game is one of a kind.ScoreGraphics 7.8Gameplay 8.7Story 8.5Overall 8.3"
4,I realy want this for myself,The game is great. You can fly or drive so many different ships. Its awesome. The best mission is where you evacuate a ice planet before its taken over. The multiplayer options areeven better.
3,Good Game As A Rental - 10-year-old completed in 3 evenings,"I bought this game for my 10-year-old son for Christmas. While he does love the game he was able to complete it in only 3 evenings. He said it was easy but did have places where it was difficult. I realize this game is rated teen but he's played almost all the teen rated Star Wars PS and computer games. This one was the easiest for him. The redeeming aspect of the game is that it has two player games. He and his 8-year-old sister are really enjoying the two player games. I was personally very disappointed with the game because he was able to complete so easily and quickly. Unless you are into the two player aspect of the game, I'd save some money and just rent it."
1,Lame!,"I got this game and I thought ""Hey it's Star wars."" Well you can only play as a jedi ( which is cool but it could been better if you can as a clone trooper like battlefront) and other stuff.Don't but in buy or rent it.If you want a Star Wars game that you can play as a trooper buy Battlefront or BattlefrontII.There WAY BETTER!!"
3,Well...it sounded promising!,"I don't know why I bother to get my hopes up anymore for Star Wars games. Sluggish controls, odd camera work, incredibly simplistic levels followed by insanely hard ones. The only thing consistent in Star Wars games nowadays is that you will walk away disappointed. That, and you know you will play the next one simply because you have played every one released before!This title suffered mostly from just a general uneveness and a sense of having been rushed. Sadly, Jedi Starfighter had a more satisfying simulation of the battle of Geonosis than this game! Save your dollars, this one is barely even worth a rental."
1,Almost as bad as Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter,"I just got done playing SW Battlefront on the hard level, no cheating.Excellent game ... a definite keeper!This game sucks!The initial graphics were cheesy, the game worse.SW is about fighting for your freedom, not getting locked into a forced playing enviroment where you're captive to poor game design.Kids may like it; I was bored after one mission.There are no extras to play.The DVD is already gone."
5,best baseball game i've ever played,"2004 is a huge upgrade on previus editions. this game is much improved and all the functions it lacked last year it has now. the presentation is the best ive seen. it is actually about baseball. last years was just a waterfall? definetly recommend this game. only small flaw is the actuall fielding still good, could of been better although.havent played the rest of this years games but i would highly recomend this game. 5/5 stars easily great game"
2,Why all the good reviews?,"This game has received solid reviews from Amazon.com customers as well as web sites dedicated to gaming and I just don't get it. Sure, it has some nice features (franchise, downloads, historical players & teams), but the graphics and gameplay are quite weak so why bother with all of those bells and whistles? Do yourself a favor and check out HH 2004 or MVP 2003."
3,Not as good as last years.,"The dvd like special features, scenario mode and the ability to edit existing players are the only improvements I can see over last years version. The batting is much harder, and its not a good thing. I had some very good hitters leading the league in strikeouts. I dont know if they changed the pitching at all but its just not as fun as last years. Even if you really enjoyed last years I recomend staying away."
5,beautiful cake plate,"This is beautiful 24% lead crystal. No, the silver is not included, it is just shown for display purposes."
1,Godinger Cake Plate,I did not get all the items shown with this item. I received the cake plate but the the serving pieces. I submitted a complaint and the item was reshipped. The serving pieces were not in the second shipment either.
2,Beautiful - but server and ladle not included,It is beautiful but I'm extremely annoyed by the fact that the cake server and ladle were missing from the package. I have yet to file a complaint and have this resolved.
4,Some Disappointments,"The product itself is excellent. Be careful if purchasing for a Char-Broil 4-burner Commercial Series BBQ. It will work, but you will not be able to attached the handle to the spit, because of the way the BBQ lid closes. Rotation speed on this unit is excellent and it is very quiet. So who needs the handle anyway?!"
1,"Not a 36"" Rotisserie","This is not a 36"" rotisserie. Go to the manufactures website. It is a 31"" spit. Otherwise, the product seems to be good quality, but I cannot use it because the spit is not long enough for my grill. I need a 36"" spit. I tried to return it to ANTOnline, but they want me to pay original shipping, return shipping, and a restocking fee. I filed an A-to-Z claim with Amazon. Hopefully, Amazon will refund all of my costs."
3,None are perfect,"I bought this rotisserie for a new grill I got for my birthday. Seems like the makers of grills and the makers of rotisseries need to commuicate a little more. Odd how the grill maker had no offer of a rotisserie of their own, yet the grill had the empty space where you can add one, if you can find one that fits! This one came as close as any. I did have to go to my local hardwear store and ""rig"" a fix to make it accually fit and work right. In the end it wasn't too bad and it now works nicely. I'd probably do it again"
4,"Nice, but doesn't fit my grill","Heavy duty, looks nice. Counterbalance is a nice touch. Bought this on a recommendation instead of the brand recommended rotisserie due to it's terrible reviews. Sadly does not fit my Kenmore B10SR9-E 3 burner grill. I'm making it work by filing down and drilling holes on the grill at the bracket area. If you don't mind some extra work It will be a nice addition to your grill."
1,Not heavy duty,"If you're looking to rotisserie something around 5 lbs, this will work. Not heavy duty and sturdy as the description states. I eventually sent it back. I wouldn't have purchased this if it gave a better description regarding the maximum amount of pounds it could withstand."
2,"Nice Product, Very Poor Instructions","This item works great, and has the extension to make it 36 inches, BUT... it has the very worst set of directions I have ever seen. If you are handy, you can figure it out, it has 2 extra mounting brackets in the box, that are not listed on the instructions. Since it doesn't work without them, you can (have to) figure it out. The Instructions page (single page) even has a section that says if you need more help see.... and then nothing. I haven't found instruction on the web. Nonetheless, once up and operational, work like a champ."
4,rotisserie review,"well, I bought the rotisserie and I must say chicken on the rotisserie was well worth it.The spit could be a little bit longer because I could not use the counter balance weight.The motor is very strong and silent. I liked it so much I bought another longer spit rod for my other grill we have at the lake, since this kit came with a universal mount and a direct fit mount I used one at the lake ,I had to drill a couple of holes but no problem.So now we just take the motor and the prong forks to the lake and we can rotisserie there and at home.I also bought a book with 300 recipes for using a rotisserie.so good eating to all"
4,"Interesting tale, with an unexpected twist","I found this to be quite an absorbing read. It interweaves different elements of storytelling effortlessly, and with every chapter that comes to pass, makes you ponder what awaits the protagonist. It takes some unravelling, but that only adds to the interest factor. If you like an absorbing read that has elements of the supernatural, and lots of twists, then this is your cup of tea."
3,What Happened?,I really liked this book - I couldn't put it down - I kept wanting to know how all the mysteries linked together. And then . . . I finished the last chapter and I thought there has to more. Maybe my copy is missing some pages - or maybe I read too fast and missed something. So I reread the last chapter again. And then the last two chapters. What happened???
2,At least I got through it,"I have to agree with other reviewers who began the book with enthusiasm and ended it as an endurance test. Sometimes the author's expertise rivals a James or Dickens in his ability to describe a scene (i.e. the fog in the library). And the first manuscript within the book was somewhat clever, but the idea was repeated too often; the more the wrinkles in the plot grew, the more confusing they became and the less they maintained my interest - too many pieces of the plot were dropped without resolution. The ending was almost contrived. It took me 2 summers to actually slug through this, with the result of too much disappointment. Hopefully the next endeavor will be a little clearer and decidedly more spellbinding."
3,An interesting read,"Ghost Writer captured my interest immediately and was hard to put down. The plot is fresh and the ending not entirely expected. But from the beginning of the tale I was uncomfortable with the way the characters fit (or failed to) into the period. The atmosphere is very gothic, and the characters echo those starchy Victorians in Anne Perry novels ... but out of place.There are several stories within the story, which was a bit confusing. In retrospect I see that their plots are relevant and revealing, but with the exception of one they did not greatly enhance my understanding or enjoyment of the story as I read it. In fact, by the third one I was finding them rather frustrating and began to skim rather than read them carefully.As events unfolded in the last few chapters I couldn't shake the feeling that I had missed something important, but didn't want to go back and look for it. In summary, I find that having finished the book I am still not sure whether I liked it."
4,Refreshingly Old Style,"It is refreshing to see a return to the style of the Victorian ghost story. In fact, Mr. Harwood cleverly uses the literary device of ""found"" ghost stories to get a chance to write in the Victorian style itself (probably not a very respected or marketable commodity today, but I love them). Although after the first ""found"" story, a bit of the reincarnated spirit fades, the first ghost story could easy have been by H.P. Lovecraft and is great fun to read.The story itself is clever and engaging, but I confess that despite Mr. Harwood's strenuous effort to build an intricate mystery, I figured it out well before the ending. That left the final misdirections of the villain seem overdone and overly confusing for a reader who hasn't figured it out. The story would have had more impact if the intricacies were lightened and the suspense/fear increased in its place. Overall, a worthwhile read."
2,No sense of satisfaction,"I was quite interested in this book initially. I was never bored and the pages kept turning. It didn't even bother me that I guessed one of the twists right off the bat. So, why the 2 star rating? Well, honestly I would have given this book a four or a five for the creativity in how the story was woven through Victorian ghost stories and letters; however, the ending completely ruined any intruiging aspect. Without giving anything away I can say that it felt like he was right in the middle of drawing the story to a high-paced conclusion when all of a sudden he gave up. He set his pen down and said, ""Okay, I don't know what else to do. So, I'm just not even going to try."""
2,What is it with Australian authors and weak endings?,"This book had a slow, but steady and good build up, and then it just ended. I hate books that just drop the story, like the author couldn't be bothered to finish up. If a book has a weak ending, it doesn't matter if the rest of the book was ok or great. If the writing up to the end hadn't been serviceable, I would have givin it 1 star. It's a crap book. Don't waste your time."
3,Good Story...Bad Ending,I really enjoyed reading this book up until the very end. Harwood builds up this HUGE climactic moment to reveal the entire plot of the story and then...blah. He totally drops the ball.
2,Ending was DOA,"I read this book for my book club and enjoyed it with all its build up and twists and turns. Sometimes with all of the stories within the stories I could get a bit confused and had to keep notes on who was who, where was where, with time shifts and character shifts, etc. But I enjoyed the tales, and I eagerly anticipated the ending of all the mysteries and connections and was waiting for the the BIG revelation, the denouement. But all this just prepared me for such a hard fall to a contrived and weak ending with so many questions left unanswered and many story threads unfinished. I felt cheated -- robbed of my final reward!"
4,"Mirror, mirror","Slow start. Decent story Line like looking into a mirror and seeing the same scene, one after the other. Creepy.other after the other"
4,Why wrongfoot your readers...,"First of all it has to be said, in Harwood's defence, that The Ghost Writer delivers on so many levels. Anyone who's a fan of the genre or just lovers of resonant storytelling will lap it up. It's wondrously atmospheric, brilliantly written and with a genuine love of character....it's just the overtly complex, frankly lazy and increasingly frustrating ending that lets it so hopelessly down. The question is WHY? Having so fluidly delivered a culmative blow to your senses in crafting such a memorable(up to a point) novel did Harwood just...let go?"
1,Not worth the effort,"At first The Ghost Writer seemed interesting but as the story went on (and on and on...) it became more of a chore to read than a delight. The cop-out ending doesn't make reading it worthwhile. The stories-within-the-story were too long, heavy and cumbersome. I tried this book because a reviewer of The Thirteeth Tale by Diane Setterfield suggested it as ""similar"". Not so, however! I would recommend checking this out of a library and not buying it, if you really want to give it a whirl..... but why bother when there are so many better books out there???"
5,look under the bed tonight,"Always having been fascinated by anything ""ghostly,"" I put this book on my wish list this year after reading a wonderful review in the Washington Post. I was pulled into the book within the first few pages, and I tried to surface periodically to regain a sense of what was real. Layer upon layer of the supernatural, of the mysterious interwoven tales within, of actual fear, kept me tightly bound to this volume. The style is immaculate, the prose is lyrical, and shades of Jane Austen, Henry James, Wilke Collins, abound. Read it, be glad you read it, and then try to sleep."
4,ghost writer,"Very well written, a bit confusing at times therefore it is sometimes difficult to follow. Other than that it is amazing."
1,a HUGE disappointment...,"Don't you hate when you become entranced by a novel early on, it sweeps you up in its story and atmosphere for the first half or so, then goes horribly, horribly wrong? That was definitely my experience with this one. The story details a timid librarian (Gerard) delving ever further into his family's past and their secrets. The elements that held me intrigued for the first half (his penpal letters to and from a mysterious girl/woman, Alice, the stories-within-stories) are the same ones that ruined it all for me in the second. It becomes tedious and obvious, not to mention strrrrretched out and over-written. And **OBLIGATORY SPOILER ALERT HERE** the biggest ""secret"" is essentially spelled out in the title. BOO! About as scary and surprising as my 6-year-old niece jumping out at me with a sheet thrown over her."
3,ok,"The stories the main character reads within the story(he finds a book as part of the mystery)were a little long, and actually kind of unnesessary. I found myself skimming through a lot of it, and the ending was underwhelming."
3,Spooky to the Max,"This is definitely not the kind of book someone should choose to read alone in bed on a dark and stormy night! Harwood's writing style is captiviating, haunting, and word-paints gripping imagery of the Victorian era through an interwoven collection of ghost stories. My only criticism, in fact, is that there were many times when the interjected stories were actually more intriguing than the premise of a young man's unrequited love for a distant and mysterious pen pal. I'll look forward to reading more of his work.Christina HamlettAuthor of Movie Girl"
1,CHAOTIC -- Spoiler inc.,"Complete and utter chaos - it went from the main story to pages upon pages of different stories within. It really messed with my head and in the end I was able to put together most of the puzzleSSSSS but come on - a corpse that uses a computer? Did I miss something? I only know one thing, next time I won't be so quick to grab a ghost story that has good reviews and cool cover.I couldn't wait to finish it. Not because it was so ""great"" but because it was agonizing. So I pick up the next book on my pile thinking -- Thank God I can go on to the next and guess what?!!! The Seance by **you guessed it** John Harwood. I could only laugh at my luck and shut down the light for the night."
1,Ghost Writer,this book does not flow well and bounces all around the end leaves much to be desiered.
2,Confusing,"The title was interesting, the reviews enticing. But when I read the book I was disappointed. I will have to decide whether to spend the time rereading it to sort it all out. Stories within stories, were they written the those known by the narrator or were they collected because of parallels? Who wrote what? Is there an element of the supernatural here or is it just mental confusion and unfulfulled wishes? I was looking for a good ghost story and this didn't live up to my expectations."
4,"Intriguing, unique, hard to put down","I just loved this bizarre story. What a unique mystery. Yes, it was somewhat confusing but I read to enjoy the ride and do my best to figure out the conclusion. His writing I felt was excellent, I could trully picture every scene in my mind so clearly. I keep checking to see if he has written more. Where are you John Harwood?"
3,Interesting - not as scary as I hoped,I enjoyed the stories but was a little disappointed in the ending. It kept you hanging on until the very end. Liked the pace and the characters.
3,Long Read to the Obvious,"What started out to me as interesting and well written seemed to lose its itensity by the end. After a while, I found myself wishing the main character would just discover what he was going to discover and get on with it. After I easily figured out that his penpal was probably dead or a figment of his imagination, I found myself just wanting him to discover what I, the reader, already knew. The writer took much too long at getting to the end, and as a result, this one fizzled out quickly for me."
3,Lots of good ideas and stories but editor should have sent it back for rewrite,"This book had a lot of potential but I think that the ending was really appallingly bad. I felt like I moved from Henry James territory into a late night re-run of a bad 1960s horror movie. I wish his editor had told the author to try again with the ending before publishing the book. What a sad waste. Maybe he'll get better with time and experience - the author clearly has potential but this is just as clearly a first novel. If you must buy, buy a used one - definitely not worth paying full price (even for the paperback version!)"
2,not what I was expecting,"I only gave this book 2 stars because in my mind it was way too confusing. I don't want to read a book that takes that much concentration. I took way too long to get me interested. I read half the book and finally gave up. I just never could get into it. I kept expecting the Ghost Story part of it, but it was too long coming, there were too many story lines, and it kept jumping around too much. I guess the problem is me, because maybe I'm too simple minded when it comes to books I like. I see all the other reviews and see everyone raving about this book, but I just don't get it. I'm a fan of Heather Graham and I love her books about the paranormal, and this is nothing like it. Too English literature for me."
4,Not so haunting as I thought it would be.,"This book was pretty good. That being said, I found that there were many issues that could have been overcome with a little bit of forethought. Therefore, it took a nose dive at the end. Although I am a fan of tragic endings, the writer reminded me of Poe in subtle ways. It was overall good, but easily figured out."
1,Keep your money,"This was, by far, one of the worst books I have ever read. I do not believe the Author, John Harwood, took the time to create an outline. If there was an outline, it was most likely as disjointed as the book itself.I found the book very difficult to follow, needing to go back several pages to try to understand what the author was trying to get across. That did not work. In fact, reading for pleasure should not be so much work. I bought this book for ""entertainment"" not a Literature Class. I should not even place The Ghost Writer in the same category of Literature.I could not believe how any of the reviewers (4 pages of them? come on!) could recommend this waste of time! I do not believe any of the reviewers even read this book themselves, but simply read the notes from one hired to read all the ""new authors"". A favor was most likely made for the ""new author"". Do not bother to read this book. Others have created stories within the genre with much better success."
1,(5 stars) Harwood's 'The Ghost Writer' debut novel should be applauded,"From the moment I stepped into Gerard Freeman's world I was mesmerised. I happened upon John Harwood's debut novel in a small book store by the beach two days ago. Since this time I have spent my time engrossed in a tale that hauntingly evoked a mixture of emotions. I agree, with some reviews, that the last five pages of the book some how let down the incredible complexity of the story line; whilst strongly disagreeing with others who describe the story line as ""predictable"". I highly recommend 'The Ghost Writer'to all readers who enjoy a good supernatural suspense/thriller."
5,A Perfect Example of a Neo-Gothic Novel,"As a former student of 18th century gothic literature I was thrilled to find the well-known themes revisited so well in this pitch-perfect wonderful new novel: veiled madwomen, crumbling ruins, mysteries, romances, ghost stories. I look forward to reading more by this author."
3,Could Have Been Brilliant,"I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of the book. But the ending made me say ""Huh?"" It seems that the author got to the last third of the story, lost interest, and dropped the plot. The ending could have been so much more creative. It would have been nice if all of the wonderful short stories were tied together so they were truly related to or affected one big event."
2,*Yawn*,"Whether you know it or not, you've seen The Task before. Granted it was in the form of plenty of other unoriginal slashers, but you've seen it before, and seen it done way better as well. A group of college kids all get to participate in a reality game show that takes place in a huge, creepy, run-down prison; with each having to accomplish various tasks that correalate with their own worst fears...or something. Such things as story, plot, character development, and any sort of logic are all tossed out the window. None of this would be that bad were it not for the fact that the first hour or so of The Task is so slow and boring and it takes forever to get anything going. Still, once it gets going, it provides some decent shocks and offers a nice enough denouement, but other than that, there isn't anything else about The Task to recommend in the least."
4,Twist's & Turns!,"This is a pretty good movie. you can tell, they really tried hard with this movie, to make it as good and surprising as possible, and i think that they pulled it off. When you think that something is for sure in this movie, it turns out not to be! And They left you hanging at the end! The acting, at times, could be a bit bland, but overall, a pretty good movie."
5,"Happy Fourth Of July, Happy...So....Happyyy","A nearly perfect set, the feel is equal parts GiantSand and Blacky Ranchette. Highlight is the meandering ""BBQ Suite"" . You take your 2-4 beers, your macrame lawn chair & your Saturday afternoon, plop yerself down by the cow-laden backyard grill, drop the needle on that puppy and sail away. ""Mope-A-Long"", less polished, more languid than the ""Still Lookin'Good"" version, ""Get To Leave"", here but a lowfi seed, yet to bloom on SnoAngel. By the time ""Lester The Lampshade"" comes about, that 2nd (or 3rd) beer is doomed and you're grinning. That's a promise. ""Lean"", the GiantSandiest of the bunch. ""Blue Waltz Reprise"" flows in and out, low tide now, wait 5 minutes for hidden track ""Rolling Stones I Am"". Here's homage, nasty, lowdown dirty blues, Howe-style. Thrashed? Yep. Trashed? You bet. It's a BBQ, afterall. This music makes me happy, you too is my hope. ""You gotcha (only) so many days here on the planet""-HG"
4,A dream.,"This book could have been written for me. I am green with envy. The peace of living alone in a beautiful, but challenging setting.....I want that, and until I can have exactly that, great books like this one with have to suffice!"
5,A Chance to learn more about Dorothy Gilman,"If you want to learn more about Dorothy Gilman, this is a great book. The author of the Mrs. Pollifax series was herself a courageous woman. After her two children left the nest, she went and lived by herself in Nova Scotia for eight years, living off the land with a minimum of worldly goods. This allowed time for self-examination and clarity of the priorities of her life. It may also encourage you to reflect about your own life and all the presure that our society places on the pursuit of ever more stuff."
2,not impressed,"I bought this game for my husband because he enjoys warfare games. I thought this would be a great game for him. However, it seemed to deal more with the political aspect than much actual fighting. He hasn't played it since the first 15 minutes he tried it out. He much prefers Medal of Honor and Conflict Desert Storm."
1,nothing to say,"Its niot worth playing,its like when you was a kid and played with toy army men.its a joke"
1,this game is like sim city for snes,"I bought this game because i though it was like you were a person with a gun and could ride in tanks and airplanes, but its noting like that. all it is is you controling your little soliders to attack whatever you click on, sounds fun huh? well to me the lasting appeal is 1 min. if you want something like airplanes and tanks and machines guns to be controlable get 1942:battlefield for the pc its way better then this. i would rate this on a scale from 1 to 10 a negative 10. its not even worth a dime. Thats why i rated this 1 star"
1,this game is horrible,I have never played a game worse then this. Don't waste any money on this game
5,"EL WATUSI, IS A MOST INSANE, LATINO BEAT!","WILD, PRIMITIVE, LATIN RYTHMS,THAT WILL SEND THE SQUARES,TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE STRATOSPHERE!"
1,It's left handed!,"I bought this with the expectation that it would be as cool as all the other Pampered Chef products. The knife function works fine for thicker slices, but the thin slicer is on the wrong side of the blade! I can't use it without crossing my arms over each other, holding the knife awkwardly backwards, or pulling the slicer toward myself which is also very awkward. Nobody in my family is left handed so this was a complete waste of money."
5,Super,"I have bought most of my knifes from Pampered Chef, until now. This knife is has s very comfortable feel and cuts wonderfully and is easy to clean."
3,useful for some,Some devices need more power coming through and this device will not allow enough through to charge my BlackBerry.
1,A little disappointed,"This is a slim book that is very nicely presented and on good quality paper. I'll have to say however that it disappointed me in the quality and subject of the author's photographs. We have Aussies as household companions and in my opinion there are a number of pictures of her dogs with plainly unhappy expressions on their faces. It's not something that gives me pleasure to look at. In addition there are far too many pictures that are blurry/out-of-focus. I have to think this was an attempt at ""art"" but it just looks like bad photography to me."
2,amateurish,"The cd was a big disappointment after reading the reviews, which make it sound like it must be great. Fact is the songs are a very mixed bag with some ok and some that I wonder why they were included. For example the cd closes with a religious hymn in which Mr. Staines sounds like a little boy singing in church. When my wife heard the cd on a recent trip, she asked me ""why did you buy this cd?"". And she did not mean that she liked it.The main problem as I see it is when Bill sings in a higher key the result is less than on a professional level of performance. When he sings in a lower key the result is much more pleasant. Unfortunately about half of the songs on this cd are in the higher key. This is one cd that will collect dust before I play it again."
3,Classic Dwight,"The sounds are the same as his early albums, which I happen to like a lot. Lots of pain and grief."
4,The Alternative Country Artist,"It's funny how Dwight consistantly churns out great sounding, very listenable records with a time proven formula. He is also true to the country in country music. ""Hey thats the formula!"" If there is any criticism it's his pretentious interviews."
4,Gets better with each listen....,"Being sort of a Country ""purist"", I like Dwight best when he sticks to traditional CW sounds, be it ""Bakersfield"" or in the Merle-type tradition (""Try Not To Look So Pretty"", ""Heart that You Own"", etc.). But there is no denying that part of what makes Yoakam such a talent is his ability to mingle genres that then seem to perfectly suit his writing abilities (which are second-to-none). This CD (like ""Gone"") is another prime example of this.While not my favorite Yoakam CD, this one still shines with outstanding cuts like ""I'll Just Take These"" and ""Yet To Succeed"". If you like Dwight, you'll be safe with this one."
5,Great music reaches the other side of the world!,"If I could, I'de like to shake Dwight's hand and personally thank him. In Israel country music is very rare. That's why sometimes I feel I'm the only one who listens to Dwight and that he's singing only to me... I first listened to ""This time"" on a trip to the US and got hooked. ""A long way home"" is the second one I got. I now want them all."

3,you might want to check out unreal tournament 2003 instead..,"Am I the first to realize that this is basically just a port of Unreal tournament 2003 to a console? They are the exact same game except Ut2K3 is for Pc and is cheaper, and Unreal Championship is for xbox, more, and you have to subscribe to xbox live. And, as with most PC games, UT2k3 is moddable, whereas UC isn't. And finally, it's harder to aim with a controller than with a mouse. But I still give this game 3 stars because even though it's hard to control, UC retains some of the fun from UT2K3."
3,Horrible,"If you are a Halo lover, this game will suck. It is so fast paced, u feel like a chicken with his head cut off. There are no cool vehicles like Halo either. Overall, the Live feature and solid graphics are its only redeeming values."
1,Boring and over-hyped,"A mix of souless gameplay, sluggish controls, and below-average maps makes this game a waste of money in my opinion. I am a great fan of Unreal Tournament, but this game is a backwards steps in the FPS arena. This is a game you will find gathering dust on your shelf for months while you play Halo online."
1,Praetorian Right Guard,"That's exactly what you need for this game - some deoderant - this game stinks!!!. Pac Man is more challenging. I've had more fun with an old game of black and white pong. My little sister (7 yrs. old) got inside within 2 hours and looked at me and said ""Mongoose, I'd rather go back and play Donkeykong - at least it has a plot."" Speaking of plot - What happened??? OK, let's kill the bad guy - new idea!!. Have fun - your friend, Mongoose."
3,Fun with Xbox Live but tough if you've never played it,"This was the first game I bought for Xbox Live. I had never played the game before. The online experience of playing is fun...really fun, especially in a team based deathmatch.HOWEVER, for someone who's never played, get ready to be killed often...and I MEAN OFTEN. It was tough to get used to even though I'm a skilled Halo fan (much of the shooting technique is the same). The learning curve is huge and can get frustrating.Overall a good game to play online but patience is an understatement...especially, if you've never played this game before!"
3,"Very Fun, but....","I realy enjoy this game, the non-stop action, the frantic pace, the character variety, the beautiful graphics, and on-line play are all great... however there are a few downfalls. The first thing you will notice is the load times are just long enough to be pretty annoying. Secondly the menu screens could have been more user friendly. It would also be nice to set up a quick pre-game profile before playing an ""Instant Action"" game. There are a couple of other things that I don't like, but all in all, this game is worth the money. Another thing: I frequently have the urge to press B for a melee attack or the Left Trigger to lob a grenade, its pretty annoying, but thats just me."
2,A perfect rent.,"This game is NOT an improvement over the previous Unreal titles. Basically, more was taken out of the game than was added in. Many of the best weopons from previous versions have been omitted (e.g. where is the sniper rifle?), and the ""feel"" of the game is less ominous than previous versions, which really detracts from the overall experience. Logging on to XBOX live and playing with others seemed very cool at first, but Unreal Championship quickly lost its appeal with me. It just didn't have the ""oomph!"" you get with some of the other XBOX titles (e.g. Halo). I anticipated this game for a long time and bought it, along with XBOX live, on the morning of the release date. I was really disappointed."
3,"Not enough depth, but kinda fun","I have Mechassault and Unreal Championship for XBL. I play MechAssault 90% more of the time because it's more interactive. Unreal is not as interative. I can blow up buildings and bolders, and cars in Mechassault, but I can only run around killing another player in this game. I like it for what it's worth, but not really worth my time to play. I wanted a shooter, and couldn't find Halo anywhere, so I opted for this, and plus it was Live enabled...but...not worth it in my estimation."
1,One of the worse games ever.,This game is horrible. Basically you can play online with EVERYONE using rocket launchers. The single player is even worse. There is 0 strategy and no fun. I would recemmend saying far away from this one.Get Ghost Recon for a good shooter. Thats assuming that you already have Halo. Ghost Recon and Halo are the two to own. Not this!!!!
2,Not worth [anything]!!!,"This game [stinks] .. Nothing at all like halo.. the graphics are the only the thing about this game that is good .. the multiplayer [stinks], too fast paced, and the single player game mode is stupid .. my advice rent it before you buy it ..."
3,Cool but............,I don't have a cable modem and cant afford cable but i thought this would be a cool buy nonetheless because it has first player and i assumed (keyword right there) that i could play it multiplayer with my friends. apparently thats not gonna happen cuz you can only have multiplayer with two xboxes or xbox live which blows massive amounts of man jiggle.
4,"Features of ""Unreal Championship""","Good Features:-Fighting is absolute madness-Killer weapons-Cool Multiplayer-XBox Live madnessBad Features:-Single player is a little short-Does not always feel realistic-Little too few weaponsStrange Features:-How come there are never any vehicles in this game?-Why can't this game just tell me how to use my adrenaline for certain things in the game manual such as ""Agility""?The awards for:Coolest weapon: The Electric gun(can't think of the name now)Worst weapon: Assault RifleBest Multiplayer Games: Deathmatch and DominationThe overall:You want to go online and play, this game can do it for you. But you might not think of it as a God's game like Halo."
2,Controls very sluggish,"Played the game over the holidays and was not impressed. I am spoiled by the PC version of Unreal, with the quick, smooth movement offered by PC keyboard controls. However, while playing the Xbox version, I felt like I was riding in an old Evinrude boat. The movement was much slower and very difficult to control. I also agree with the other reviewer who complained about the ""boxed in"" level environment, as well as the sorry selection of weapons and the ineffectiveness of what is there to use. Also, the pop-up info was very annoying. Luckily, I purchased this from a store that allows returns as I intend to do. I can't believe we waited so long for this one."
2,Not a good game.,"I only rated it two stars because I thought that, otherwise, you'd discount my opinion as biased. A horrible game. One dies so randomly, it doesn't count as a 'frag-fest' anymore. No, now it is called 'chaos'. And that isn't fun. No-one likes to just die, instantly and randomly."
2,No Where Near Halo,"I thought this game was going to be great, after the first round of action I was dissapointed. This game is fun, for a while, but then it becomes very repetitive and uninteresting, not many weapons, game modes very original but they become boring."
3,Quick Considerations,"There are a select number of things that you absolutely must consider when puchasing this item or you may find yourself very dissapointed.Do you own Unreal Tournament 2003? If you do then you should avoid this title unless you specifically want to play against/with your friends on Xbox Live or you don't have the PC option. The PC counterpart of this game has graphics that are much prettier and higher end PC's won't have the framerate problems that bog this system down. In fact, this game is trimmed down in all sorts of ways compared to the PC version. Statistics tracking is not as deep, audio is lower quality, you sacrifice the accuracy of a mouse and keyboard setup and many other little nuances.However, if you do not have a PC and really want a version of Unreal for your console this is really the only option. While the game presented here is not really bad, it simply does not live up to the radical standards set by the PC release."
4,I still think Halo is more fun.,"I got this game thinking it would be better than Halo. Unreal Championship is fun but it just doesn't have that same flavor of Halo. When I shoot someone with a minigun, I expect him/her to die quickly. Same with the rocket launcher. I just don't like it when someone survives 3 rockets shot at them. I really don't like the rocket launcher. It doesn't look like one and it doesn't look like you're shooting a rocket. It is very confusing if you want to play multiplayer. There is no multiplayer option in the menu, yet multiplayer is available; up to 4 on one Xbox. I haven't played xbox online yet but if I had a choice between Halo and Unreal Champinship, I'd play Halo."
2,Where is it?,I ordered this game a week and a half ago and still havent recived it. Ive been a loyal customer of amazon and i have never had a problem reciving an item before but this has gotten to be rediculous. Next time i want a game I will definately be buying from gamestop that way i know i will recivece my game the same day. This is a joke. I was quoted an estimated arrival date is july 7th it is now the 12th and the package is on the other side of the country.
3,Something to do until Halo 2,"Not a bad game, but not as great as Unreal Tournament 2003 for the PC either. If you don't have Xbox Live, don't even bother with this game. If you do have Live, then this makes for some fun online play. However, it doesn't look quite as good as UT2003 on PC, but the lag also isn't usually as bad either. For now, it's not a bad choice for the Live enabled. But it's no Halo 2."
3,Disappointing . . .,"I traded this back after one day of play. I got it along with Xbox Live, expecting to have a fun day. Truth is, Halo has spoiled me. Ultimate Championship is about grabbing a weapon of choice and running around with your trigger button down. Whoopee. And some of the maps are just so small. It makes for mindless gaming.Sure, the game has it's moments, but I'd rather be playing Halo online anyday."
4,Short. Very Short.,"I was finished with this game in two or three days. It's way too easy. To play this game is to get a very bad idea of what another person plays like. The graphics are sub-par although the controls are plenty good.There are actually plenty of levels on which to compete, but the first few go by so quickly, that before you know it, you're at the end.Wait until the price comes down to 19.99. Then buy it. The graphics are that bad. This is no Quake."
2,Wait For Halo 2,"unless you have xbox live, and can find a open game, this game is no better than a coaster, ok 2 points for graphics, But where is the plot? what is the point of playing? senseless violence? they could have at least thrown some form of story in this game, i mean yeah, deathmatch can be fun but it gets old fast. most FPS have gaping plot holes in their stories, this one doesnt, because there is no plot, so in summary if you want senseless violence that goes down no path, get this game, otherwise i would reccomend waiting for halo 2 or get brute force"
2,Not Ivory,Smells horrible nothing like ivory total waste of money ivory changed their formula will have to change brands now back to the cosmetic isles.
3,Not Twitty's best.,Some of these sounds I never heard by Conway Twitty before and was disappointed with this album. A couple of good ones.
5,Ray Price at his best,"This was the first Ray Price original re-issue I got, and it sounds as good now as in the mid-60's when I had the vinyl. The title song has long been my favorite country song, and I've performed it many times myself. The vocal gymnastics of Ray Price coupled with the most creative steel work ever done by Buddy Emmons make this, in my opinion, the best produced country song ever. Willie Nelson's lyrics and chord progessions are also incredible. The only negative on this is the lengthy introduction at the beginning. It's interesting the first couple of times, but soon makes you fast forward to the real song. The rest of the album is superb, especially""Pride"" and the jazzy ""Bright Lights and Blonde Haired Women"" with more amazing Buddy Emmons steel work. This is a must for any Ray Price fan."
5,Great Coffee,Deliciously fresh coffee. I use it in my stove top Bialetti expresso maker and it has the best flavor ever!
5,Excellent Resource,"Dr. Glauberman's CD's offer a unique and effective means for changing your subconscious mind. By combining hypnotic induction with Ericksonian type stories, the suggested changes to your subconscious begin to take root without any effort. I particularly appreciated the open-ended nature of the stories to allow the subconscious to make its own representations as needed."
3,SHORT life span,"I received the Melitta for my birthday last year & instantly fell in love. I loved it for all of its unique features... the freedom to each drink our own preferred flavor without wasting a whole pot of coffe, the quickness of the brew, the ease of use, the sleek design. It was great for entertaining small groups and even better day to day (even a sleepy person can get their coffee without much thought)I enjoyed the Melitta for 10 straight months before my world crashed down on me.The element blew. They cannot fix it... and they cannot offer me a free replacement because the 12 month warrenty is only good if you have a receipt. Unfortunately for me - this was a gift. Customer service was quick to respond but unable to offer any consolation.As much as I enjoyed the Melitta - a year to remember - I am having a hard time buying a new one. For all of its strengths are not worth $49.99 each year!!!!HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!"
4,"design great, coffee ...hmmm","No debate: the Melitta is the Italian racing car of coffee maker design. And some of us care about that. The Melitta pods produce what seems to be called ""American style"" taste: a bit bland, weak, thin. No confusing it with coffee made in a French press. ""Buzzworthy"" is the only Melitta pod that comes near deep coffee taste with overtones of Italian Roast smokiness. If you like grocery store coffee made in a drip carafe, you'll like Melitta coffee. But for others who crave depth, buy other pods on-line.Regarding tea: Melitta's seems, again, thin. But I've had great success using Republic of Tea brand, which naturally comes in a pod shape. One pod-bag with 5 oz water will give a full-taste shot. For me, one pod-bag with 8 oz water is, well, watery. You can, however, fit 2 pod-bags together in the pod holder and get a delightful 8 oz cup!"
2,"Leaky machine, Senseo's a Better Choice",I'm glad I bought this- even though I took it back. It made me discover that pod coffee is fantastic- worth all the troule. I couldn't live with this machine though. It leaked. Filters didn't fit well. Water leaked down the body and on top of the spout (in addition to coming out of the spout). You should use Melita pods only- they're 45 mm while Senseo machines and Home Brew (Folgers etc) pods are 60. I bought a Senseo machine instead ($67) and love it. No leaks. One caution- these things make little cups (5-6 oz) and take one pod per little cup. They're still worth it though. Best coffee I've ever made at home.
2,lousy coffee,"I received a Melitta one/one coffee machine for Christmas.The machine works fine,but I ordered 5 different flavored coffees and can't decide which is the worst.They are all bad. Weak and do not taste like coffee. I will try to find a compatible pod from some other source before giving up entirely."
3,Average Coffee,"I recieved this machine as a Christmas gift. I had asked for a Senso. I HATE the fact that you have to use Melitta coffee. It is very dificult to find in local stores, Target carries a few varietys...for now. So basically you'll have to go online to buy your coffee. Senso pods on the other hand are avaiable everywhere. Quite frankly the coffee isn't much better than instant and no where near as good as a cheap french press. There is no froth like the Senso. I was however pleased with the tea and Ice tea. But then again, is it any easier to use this machine than a tea bag and a cup of water in a microwave?"
2,"Good Idea, Bad Coffee","This coffee maker has nice looks and doesn't take up much space. Clean up isn't all that complicated and operation is intuitive. OneOne falls short where it counts. I tried a few different pod brands and the coffee was weak; even with the small cup setting and a dark roast pod. The water resavoir is flimsy and some water is spilled when it has to be removed. Another downside is that the pump has to be primed if the machine hasn't been used in as little as three days. Outside of not having to scoop coffee, this machine has nothing over an automatic drip. If you're still interested in coffee on the go, try the ""Melitta Take Two"". You get automatic drip coffee in a convenient to go cup for half the price."
3,"Leaky, Lots of Broken Pods, But Great Tea and Easy Cleanup","I got the Melitta because I live alone, and only ever want one cup. The coffee is OK, and I like the fact that I don't have to clean a carafe. The tea is actually better than the coffee, particularly the raspberry. Problems: The pods are hard to find in stores, or at least, the varieties are hard to find. Do NOT try to use another brand's pods--they don't fit and make a mess. My first box of pods also had 4 duds out of 18, that is, pods that had split seams with coffee leaking out. The thing leaks all the time with coffee, less so with tea. 8 oz. is not a lot of coffee, so I frequently make 2 cups, which is a lot of money when you think of it--might as well buy a cup somewhere. Finally, it makes a ridiculous amount of noise. But I have to admit that my red one looks really cute, and it is very easy to clean, just take out the basket and spout and stick them under the faucet."
2,Had 2 of these but...,"The first was a Christmas present, and out of the box it brewed a nice cup with the Melitta pods. After two or three months the machine spontaneously started heating water, and it didn't stop until the entire reservoir was boiled out and onto the counter. Melitta promptly replaced the unit, but the second has done the same thing. Apparently steam/water gets someplace it shouldn't. Doesn't seem to matter whether the pods were the Melitta proprietary design/size, or the more standard ones stuffed into the holder. I'll contact Melitta because it's still less than 12 months, but really I'd just like my (wife's) money back. Looks like a different maker is in my future!"
4,Buzzworthy,"I got a great deal on this from the office supply company I use at work. I'm single and yes I love a good cup of coffee, but I don't need a large pot or an elaborate set up, and I really didn't want to pay 1.20 per cup with a Kruieg coffee maker. The minute I got this home I set it up primed the pump washed the accouterments and took the advice of a previous reviewer and ran the water through the brewer a few extra times before making my first cup. I purchased Malitta pods the Parisian ""Buzzworthy"", Creame Brulee, and French Vanilla I have tried the Parisian and Brulee they are not the best cup but they are pretty good for what I paid for the brewer. Other reviewers complained about the container being to small, well yeah it is if your not single so keep that in mind when you're browsing for a single cup brewer."
2,"Worked well, for a year","I received this machine for Christmas 2003. It worked well for one year. Then one day after its anniversary, it just died. Lights up, but no heat, no drawing up of water...it is just dead.No customer service from Melitta at all. Nothing. Guess they just assume I'll go out and buy a new one.Wrong they are. Too many choices now."
1,Disappointed!!,"I am a true coffee lover and was excited about my Melitta Coffee One One. The thought of a fresh cup of coffee whenever I wanted seened too good to be true. I have tried all the coffee blends sent along with the maker and have not had a good cup of coffee. The 5 ounce serving is a half cup of coffee and the 8 ounce is not even a full mug of weak coffee so if you want a full mug of coffee you need two pods of 5 ounce and even then it just isn't worth the trouble. I am hoping Melitta will make an adapter and some new bigger pods so that they make a bigger, bolder cup of coffee. My husband, who doesn't like strong coffee the way I do also thinks the coffee is weak. What a disappointment. One good note is that my daughters stick a tea bag in the pod holder and enjoy the tea it makes."
2,Don't waste your money,I was very dissapointed in this product. I wasted $60 for a leaky machine with very few choices of coffee. Just save up a few more bucks and get yourself a Keurig.
2,Terrible Results...,"If you hold your cup of coffee close to your heart, like you do with your loved one, you will want to avoid this machine. I am an avid coffee drinker, and I had received this machine as a gift. Now I like to stick to a pure coffee brewing system by using a French press (hot water + coffee); but I do own a Senseo for when I'm lazy. Compared to my Senseo, the coffee Melitta produces is terrible... Compared to the coffee we drink at work, made out of the cheapest beans money can buy, the Melitta result tastes terrible. The best tasting coffee I could make with the Melitta came from using two packets of the dark roast blend (you need to put in one packet, then brew one cup, and insert another packet and brew another cup), anything else and you will get a very dull flavored, bitter, and watery coffee. A co-worker has this very same machine, and she crams the Senseo pods into the Melitta, and does get ok results.2/5 starts because it does make coffee quickly and cleanly."
2,great,"this does exactly what it says it will. only probem is it only creates five or eight ounces of coffee..only fills a tradional mug 3/4 of the way. plus, java pods are difficult to find in store. so be prepared to purchase online."
4,Pleased Melitta,I was replacing an old Melitta single serve coffeemaker and this was the least expensive. It works great.
1,Headed for the dumpster--dangerous,"I have the spewing-scalding version of this unit.I called Salton and was told to replace the seal.This is a great idea, but I'll stick to an electric kettle and French Press coffee, which tastes better, is cheaper and doesn't expose me and my co-workers to a 2nd degree burn.Run, don't walk away, from this madness."
5,Best one cup brewer for the environment,"Compared to the other types of one cup brewing machines, this pod system creates no waste. If you are an avid recycler/composter like me, the pods make great compost. If you don't have time for that, it is easy to rip the pods open and empty used grounds over the garden, and throw the paper (which is biodegradable) in the garbage. Unlike all those plastic one shot type containers that accumulate non-biodegradable garbage, melitta pods are a great choice for the environmentally conscious. If you buy decent coffee to begin with, the taste is also comparable to other machines. Great product!"
4,Melitta MES2B Single Serve Coffee Maker,"I have used the coffee maker for the past couple of weeks, and it seems to make decent coffer using the Folgers Pods. The coffee is better then what I make in the normal 10Cup maker. I like it since for the single cup that I need it is quick and easy. Also really not cleanup required like when you use the traditional pot to make coffee."
3,Mediocre,"I recieved my Melitta pod brewer as a gift. I like the concept of having a pod brewer because it is supposed to be convinient. What I hate about this machine is that it the coffee pods are proprietary, coffee is too strong, and its not the right temperature. I think that their should be a standard size coffee pod that would fit all pod brewers and their should be more variety of coffee. If you love coffee like I do and care about quality and taste I would go with a drip machine or french-style coffee press and grind my own fresh beans (no using that canned Folgers crap). And the tea that is brewed from this machine isn't the best either it's again too strong. If you are more concerned about quickly getting a caffine fix that will last you 24 hours then go for a pod brewer. In my opinion no real coffee aficionado will truly appreciate coffee that comes pre-ground and sealed in a pod."
3,moderately satisfied,change to four stars.this was a gift for someone who was not too impressed with it. she said the coffee was ok. i don't drink caffinated coffee so i can't review it.she kept it an has been happy with it. i like the neatness of the product - how little counter space it needs.
3,Bland Coffee,"Bland bad coffee, can't wait to be out of pods so I can pitch it. Easy to use no clean up,wish it had larger capacity water holder, wish coffee tasted good through it"
4,"It's almost perfect, but...","I've been using this 2-3x a day for 3 weeks. It's an attractive unit. Price was right ($50). Clean up is quick and easy. Pre-heating the water takes about a minute before each cup. Overall, I'm satisfied with the unit for personal daily use. But I have two complaints:1. It leaks. I've followed the manufacturer instructions to properly seat each coffee pod in the tray and seal the top of the unit. Yet coffee ends up dribbling down the front of the unit into the spill tray.2. I wish more water would be used to fill a large cup of coffee. I tried a trick to run the machine immediately again using the same pod and the small cup option, but it doesn't work. The coffee that comes thru the second time is much weaker."
4,"Try this coffe maker, Just get your pods from podhead.com","The coffe from Melitta is only passable, but go to Podhead.com and select the brew you like best. I have been amazed at the increase in my morning happiness after getting my first order from podhead. Trust me I love coffee."
3,Noisy beast.,"Warning.. if you plan to use this in your office..this thing is Noisy. You will have all your cube mates wondering what you are doing. I tried Sesnseo Pods.. they make the machine leak. If you want to control the strength of your coffee.. this machine ain't it. This is just a bit above standing in front of the 25cent coffee machine. Nice to brew green tea, however."
1,Disappointed,"I just received the Melitta One:One today after reading all the prior, mostly favorable reviews. I use very little milk with my coffee so when I discovered that the eight once setting yields only 6 to 7 ounces, I felt that I had less than a full cup. That is, however, a small annoyance compared to bitter metallic taste of the coffee. I tried several different flavor pods. They were all terrible. I called Saltan's customer service to be told that the volume yield was normal and that it takes some customers up to three months to get used to the taste.I am amazed that so many reviewers who claim to be coffee lovers actually like the coffee from this machine. I am also surprised that some reviewers indicate that this is their first experience with a single cup machine. Black and Decker has a simple electric drip machine on the market for many years which costs about $15 - $20 and produces a decent cup using any brand or flavor."
1,TOO disappointing,"Positive: nice red colorNegative: How much space do I have? Seriously, the Melitta coffee pods are hard to find unless you order through the mail. There are few varieties and it is not particularly appealing in any flavor. Although there are plenty of other pod options @ the grocery, they are just a bit too big to fit well without causing most of the coffee to leak into the drip tray rather than flow to the cup. Sometimes I can get the pod almost properly positioned resulting in a fair cup of coffee & not too much mess to clean up. (I can appreciate the other reviewers who wrote how to trouble shoot some of these glitches - but I paid good money for a new coffee maker from a ""brand"" company so had some expectations....) The worst part is that when I politely wrote Melitta to express my disappointment they were not even courteous enough to reply to my correspondence."
1,What a POS...,"Started having problems with hot water spraying out and burning those who stand in front. Contacted Melitta and they said they are aware of the issue and I have to ""purchase"" a pod holder adapter due to the pods are too thick. I questioned charging people for something they manufactured and were notified was defective, the dummy on the phone didn't have an answer. I do not recommend this product. Maybe a class action is due?"
4,Good one-cupper,I really like this machine. It's fast & easy to use. It does drip a bit but not so much that I would stop using it. The problem mainly stems from using the larger sized Folgers pods in the machine (I agree with other reviewers that these make a much better cup of coffee)which for the most part can be corrected by removing the used pod immediately after brewing. Bottom line - it's a great way to get a quick cup of joe!
1,Melitta One To One is over designed/engineered,"At its best the Melitta One To One is only able to brew a demitasse, ""8 oz"", size cup of coffee/tea. One wonders why such a size cup from such an ""over engineered"" coffee/tea maker. The Melitta One To One designer appears to be a Magna-Cum-Laude graduate of the Rube Goldberg School of Mechanical Engineering. For anyone with even limited mechanical ability, to use the Melitta One to One, is an exquisite macabre experience of frustration. Overall valuation 1 out of five. GOOD LUCK to anyone who owns one. Nicholas P Heille 3460 Garfield St NE Mpls MN 55418"
1,useless,My college daughter and her friends have followed the directions NUMEROUS times and cannot get a decent cup of coffee. Don't waste youe $$.
2,Very weak coffee,"Even though I've always used fresh pods etc, the coffee is always very weak. Its sufficiently hot as far as I'm concerned, but not very good. I'm still looking for a better replacement."
2,Only Melita brand Pods fit,"I bought the Melita without much research because Target had it for $24. I think it's because they are going to be phasing this model out. (Just a guess.) The Melita One must be named ONE because it only fits one sized pod, theirs. And theirs is smaller than all the others out there. I wish I had done a bit more homework before buying it. I did hear that PodHead.com now sells pods that fit this machine. I have not personally tried them though."
1,"Weak, lukewarm, flavorless coffee","I called Melitta to make sure I was operating the machine properly, and I was. The coffee looks dark, but is weak, flavorless, and not served hot enough. And I don't even like my coffee very hot! Very disappointed."
2,I won't buy another,I made the mistake and bought the Melitta one cup coffee maker not once but twice. the first one lasted for a few month and the second was broken when I took it out of the box. The coffee was okay but not the best in the world. Now my problem is that I am stuck with alot of pods and no coffee maker. I am hoping that these pods will work in other machines.
1,****Dangerous defect even if the coffee is good****,"The One:One coffee machine makes great coffee but after a week's use scalded me when a jet of pressurized steam and water shot out of the front at me. Four more attempts to use it, with a towel as shield from the steam and pain and mess offered three more ""geysers."" An urgent call to customer service got me the ""overflow"" operator who could only take orders but not even a message to the real company. I've replaced the machine with a Philipp's Senseo which, so far, does as good a job making coffee but doesn't result in the burn ointment being needed."
1,Broke within the first year,"I bought this coffee maker at Target. I did not like the fact that most standard coffee pods such as Folgers, Senseo, etc. do not fit this coffee maker. Nevertheless, I was able to find a giga-pack of Melitta's brand and propper size pods.The coffee machine stopped working shortly after a year, when an internal hose broke, and the hot water would just drip all over the counter. So much for this disposable coffee maker !"
3,coffee hound,"I was a convert to the single serve coffee maker. It's functionality, convenience and freshness have been enjoyed UNTIL NOW...The first month after our Melitta purchase I enjoyed a perfect cup of coffee every time. Suddenly the machine is producing brown water. I have to pull out the cup halfway through brewing in order to have a halfway decent cup of joe. At the same time I have to shove in another cup under the spout to catch the extra brown water runoff. The higher-end single serve coffee makers seemed too big and lacked the aesthetic quality the Melitta had, but ""sleek"" doesn't make my coffee right anymore!"
4,"Good idea, pods problematic","The coffeemaker itself is a good idea and works well. The Melitta coffee pods produce barely acceptable results, and recent lots have included many defective pods that leak grounds and create a mess when opened. However, it is possible to use pods designed for other machines if one is very careful to ensure that these are carefuly stuffed into the carrier with NO material overlapping the rim. This includes the Gevalia pods that have recently become available by mail."
2,Disappointing machine,"I received this machine as a wedding present. I thought it would be perfect since my husband and I rarely drink more than three cups between the two of us a day. I didn't expect the machine to leak as much as it does, often during the day when it is turned off. The brown water it spills out often stains my countertops and I have to struggle to keep the drip tray from over flowing.We bought the Melitta pods thinking that would ease our leaking problems (we were using Folger's before), but to our dismay the leakage stayed the same.I will probably keep this machine for a few more weeks until we break down and buy a regular coffee machine."
1,reasonably good while it lasted,"It didn't last long. After only a couple of months, we could only get it to do the wash cycle, not the brew-coffee cycle.Overall, not worth the bother. Get an electric teapot and a single-cup filter cone if you want your coffee one cup at a time!"
2,Leaking,I have the Melitta One: One maker and the Millstone and Folgers coffee pods do not properly fit into the pod holder. The seem larger than the Melitta pods. The machine leaks. Any sugesstions? I would rather not purchase Melitta coffee.
2,Melitta OneOne Coffeemaker,"We have only used this machine to make coffee. Most of the Melitta pods in the variety pack that came with it taste pretty awful, however he machine will take pods of different brands. The coffeemaker started leaking from the spout after about 8 months of light use. After 10 months of ownership, it will be replaced with another brand."
4,I have read the reviews and I am happy with my purchase,"I read any review I could find online about ALL pod makers out there and decided on this one for me. I'm happy with my choice. The first time I used it alittle water leaked down the front of machine but since then I just make sure the pod is all the way in, just push it down. I have tried some of the flavors and Im happy with Buzzworthy but wish there was a bigger selection in stores. I think it heats up great. Its brew time is so fast! No more wasted coffee if I only want a cup or two not 12 and its always a fresh cup. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars for its lack of coffee pods available in stores."
4,Great little coffee machine,"I bought this two months ago, and I use it every day. I used to only drink coffee at work and restaraunts. I rarely took time to make coffee at home, mainly because of the time and mess. This has solved both problems. Even my wife has become a coffee drinker since we bought this gadget. We now keep a drawer stocked with various coffees and teas. It is like having our own mini-coffee shop. I suggest trying other brands of pods. The Melitta are good, but so are some others. I take away one star for occasional glitches, like random power resets and leaks. Nothing serious, but it has me scratching my head right now. Of course, this machine costs a fraction of the price of fancier ones. It's a great addition to almost any kitchen."
1,Completely Useless!!!,"This is one of those items that sounds great but is so poorly designed that it is absolutely useless. The neck strap is not adjustable, and although I am of average height, the apron hangs so low on my torso that it is just a nuisance. I am a thin man, but this apron is so narrow that it it doesn't come around my sides at all, and so doesn't really provide adequate protection. I like to be able to bring the waist straps around and tie them in the front (I don't like tying and untying straps behind my back), but the straps are too short for this. It is just not functional in any way. It is a shame, because the quality of the material and the workmanship appears to be very good. I am a long-time woodworker and appreciate a good shop apron, and wanted to replace my trusty old fabric apron with something a little tougher, but this was a mistake."
4,White boys sing the psychedelic blues,"Once upon a time in the South, there lived four white boys who loved the Blues: Jim Dickinson, Lee Baker, Sid Selvidge, and Jimmy Croswaithe. They helped put together the Memphis Blues Festivals in the 60's and the Beale Street Music Festivals in the early 70's. They were devoted to Furry Lewis, Bukka White, Fred McDowell - all of the old country blues musicians. When the young black musicians turned their back on the blues, Mudboy helped to keep the music alive. This record is not the highest fidelity, but the feeling is there. Little Queenie is a lasting tribute to the great Lee Baker. World Boogie is coming!"
2,not for me,"definitely could not fit my toothbrush or razor in here, idk what kind everyone else uses, i have the gilette fusion and a regular sized toothbrush."
1,Too BIG - really? For 2 toothbrushes it needs to be HUGE?,"Who has a 3 lb toothbrush?? This thing is GOOFY. ""Each holder holds 3lb"" - No doubt, as it ridiculously large. I have loved Command hooks before and have them in our home, so thought this would be perfect for hanging a couple of toothbrushes in the bathroom. For something that only needs to hold a few ounces (not a total of 6 pounds!), it could be a simple holder; instead, 3M has engineered it many times larger than practical, and though I thought twice before ordering and figured I'd give it a shot, I am now cautioning you! I'm sure it works great. It's just TOO BIG."
2,Command toothbrush holder,"It works well, but it is bulky and takes up some space. Had to re-arrange my med cabinet. I did not notice at the time I ordered it, but the shipping was a bit on the high side. At the end of the day, I am happy w/ it. After all, it's not feasible to send it back fee wise.I now have had this holder for about a year or so. I went to move it and the ""command tape"" does not want to release itself from the interior side of the glass in my med cabinet! Glad I didn't place it on a wall of a mar-able surface, cause it ain't budging!! Just FYI!!"
4,Best holder ever,"This organizes all your razors, toothbrushes and other items both in the medicine cabinet and on the shower wall. No more items piled on top of each other."
2,Truly abysmal gaming,"This is not an Xbox caliber game.- Graphics: Incredibly weak. While better than something for PS2, they are not Xbox quality. It's actually painful to watch cutscenes. I knew I was in trouble the minute the opening movie began showing them being shot down. It was awful.- Voice acting: Everyone sounds incredibly stereotypical, as if they said to a computer ""please give us a German accent"" ,""now a scottish one"". Incredibly generic. The german camp commander is the worst.- Gameplay. Simplistic to say the least. It's definitely an easy game to pick up and play.- Plot. Yawn. Too long waiting for things to happen. Bored after the first hour.I would not even recommend this as a rental to someone. It was that bad. It was an interesting idea, but incredilby weak execution of the idea."
1,STAY VERY FAR AWAY!,"There's not enough words to discribe how bad this game is. Many of the short-comings have been pointed out by the other reviews. I liked the premise. After that, the game went down hill fast. Graphics, voices, gameplay, ect.- all very sub-standard. If all these warnings don't deter you, rent it. For around $$$ you will play it, hate it, and move on."
1,Bad game,This game isn't even worth renting. It is so boring. You have to try to get past the German guards and everything you try to do gets you in trouble. Don't waste your money.
2,Not What You Might Expect,"This game got everyone's hopes up for a realistic ""prisoner of war"" scenario. What you get is a preset plot with no divertion. Your viewpoint is nonchangeable and rigid. When you ""sneak"" about the guards can see you and your character looks like he's bopping along the screen-its very funny to watch. All in all not a game I would want to buy."
3,Not As Good As I Thought,"Set during World War 2, Prisoner of War drops you into the role of an Allied fighter pilot. Shot down over Germany, you are captured and placed into a P.O.W. camp. Using only your wits and a little bit of stealth, you must escape from the camp. Easily the biggest problem with the game is the lack of interaction with the game's enviroment. Out of necessity you can explore the camp, yet everything you find is mere window dressing. The only items you can touch aer those apsolutely necessary to the plot. As a result the game is forced down a straight path. Another bad thing is if you pick up an item you can only use it at a certain time. In the end, Prisoner of War is a great concept that never quite delivers on its immense promise."
1,WOW ITS REALLY BETTER THAN BARNY,"it was so fun i fell asleep. the grafiks was way better then my super nintendo. the peeple move better then the rok in my bak yard. the accent sounds like my brother wen he ""stoned"". i recomend this to anyone who likes really bad games. kuz it was really, really bad"
2,Very dissapointed after the long wait,I had high hopes for this game but I am sad to say Prisoners of War did not live up to it's expectations. No freedom to do as you wish. You must follow the preset plot. The graphics are good but this game is not worth buying. Try renting it .
1,Save Your Money!,"To be fair, I didn't play the game for very long. Maybe it gets better, but it certainly can't get much worse. I can deal with graphics that aren't up to an xbox users expectations, but this is only the beginning. The controls are awfull, the game is not exciting whatsoever, and there is no way to skip past the repetitive cut-scenes that will inevitably drive one out of his mind when having to go back for a ""do over"". I don't feel like wasting too much time on this game, even slamming it in a review, so I will keep my criticism brief. Don't waste your time or money on this game. It is lacking the action and ingredients that any true xboxer has come to expect."
2,Prisoner of War,"I rented it last night, and it bites. The graphics are horrible, and so is the voice acting. The game isn't even that fun."
4,Most Realistic Graphics and Circumstances,"I could not believe how great this game is! The music rocks. The physics of the ATV react exactly how you see them! Anything you see on the screen is very realistic. It is simply put, the best ""driving"" game I have ever played. And I have tried alot (Project Gotham, Need For Speed, etc.) For the low cost that it is, it is worth it. You will have many hours of gameplay."
4,The party game the xbox needs!,"This is a very fun game. End of story.Well, there is a bit more to it, actually: This game is not a mile stone in entertainment software. It is not going to rival games such as Rallysport Challenge, Project Gotham, or MotoGP. But it is a lot of fun to play.It is also easy to learn, which makes this game one of the few games one can play with friends that do not normally play a lot of games. Today, most games are so sophisticated, they just don't allow serious and casual gamers to play together. This game is different! (And has a few nasty features such as kicking the other drivers off their ATV... this can add some spice to a friendly rivalry...)Just for being a fun party game, I would give this game 5 stars. Of course, that wouldn't be quite fair to games such as Splinter Cell."
4,Not again!!!,"Don't you hate when someone makes a sequel to a already bad game?You do? Then it's time to quit hating, Climax's latest is light years better than it's ugly-as-sin predecessor and is already worthy to compete against Sony's Offroad Fury series. The visuals have taken a giantic leap forward, the tracks are more intelligently designed (but still have stupid obstacles that require no memorization to avoid), and the controls have gotten the reworking they desperately deserved. If you can live without that ""other"" game's online support, then this is golden."
4,Very Fun,This game is very fun and very easy to play and very simple. When I was in like 3rd grade I was able to win the game. I really like how the effects are on the game as well.. I enjoyed it alot!
1,Love the game - When it doesn't lock up on the Xbox 360,"I bought this game because it was listed as a compatible game for the Xbox 360. It works great in single mode, but when you try to race 3 or 4 players on a split screen the game locks up. I have the current software version and I double verified that Microsoft says that it will work with the 360, but from my experience, don't bother trying. Great game if you have the original Xbox."
5,Home Theater's Inconspicuous Little Bad-Boys,"This was a tough purchase, i.e. just go by specifications and not actually hear them? I toiled on this for a couple weeks and decided to go with it. I'm running a Carver sub, NHT L/R/C and the KEF's in the back channels. With my THX 4,000 watt home theater system these speakers not only sound good, they can keep up even with their short size. They sound great with music or movie's. Clean and crisp and with such realism I sometimes have to rewind just to prove I heard something in the background. Very easy to install, although somewhat confusing, i.e. I made a Styrofoam cutout first, installed it, just to see how the thing fixes inside the wall (very cleaver). Wish the cone, however, was black. Still give them a five star."
5,this item was great!,My daughter loves this! She watches this over and over again. Its a fun movie for her and it also gives me a chance to do what I need to do while she's watching it.
1,The Lost,"I am greatly upset by this product. I have seen the screen shots and think the game appears awesome. However, Crave has put this game off since November last year. Furthermore, it cancelled its release on XBox, and plans only to release it on PS2. Therefore, my one star comes from the fact that visually, the game appears great. Otherwise, based on the all the hype and none of the product, I rate this game -10 stars."
4,Drew_is_cool,"Amazing game, worth every penny. ITs an awesome game, walkin around exploring hell, i mean, what could be better then that?answer: NOTHING"
3,GOOD SELLER,"THe tape didnt work. It was an older VHS tape and I was dissappointed that for the money I spent on it, I couldnt use it at all. I did have to send it back and I gave this a good rating because the seller was easy to contact and prompt to refund me."
3,"Movie: ""Call Me""",I felt this movie was so-so but I was surprised to see real names were used in some cases....
4,"The Cable movie Call Me, is very identical to Unrated DVD","I first saw this movie on USA Network on cable, I thought it would be one of those life time movies about cheating and killing but I was wrong. THis is a good movie about this lady. It stars pretty good on how she started in that prostitution business and keeps going. IT has barely any full sex scenes and just a bit of nudity. No BIG Deal.Still I like this DVD because it does pretty good as to introducing the character of Heidi Fleiss but their was no real celebrity stuff.If you are like me, knows nothing about the lady, watch it. If not dont bother.The bad: short amount of time."
3,Mangled tracklisting,"I would give the UK version of this album, which I own, 4 or 5 stars. I've heard the US version at the local record store - and in my opinion this is a case of the consumer loosing out to the interests of the label. For some unknown (but clearly bad) reason, the US album omits two of the three best songs from the UK version - Penthouse Girl / Basement Boy and Taking Off For France (the third, mercifully included, is Costal Towne) - in the place of these we get Desert Baby - which thankfuly is about as good as the two removed songs, a couple of other B-sides that sort of drag the album down, and a previously unreased track that doesn't do all that much. Bottom line, if you can find the import version for a reasonable price, go for it, but skip the US release."
5,One of the best pop albums out there.,"Picked it up based on my being a big fan of STE, and not knowing what to expect, and what an incredible album."
4,"sarah, you can do better!","i like it and i want to sell it, no i don't. but if i had known this was a 97 release, i probably wouldn't have bothered buying it, because it DOES sound a little outdated. much more than FOXBASE ALPHA does, funny thing. saint etienne is the real thing, 5 stars for all of their stuff. 4 for this one, i think it's a fair deal. go and buy broadcast's NOISES MADE BY PEOPLE! and start a disconight and tell me where and when!"
3,sarah sans stanley wiggs,"I admit that I have listened to this CD many times, and it certainly is superior to the UK version (although ""Taking off for France"" from the UK version should not have been deleted - why was this removed and not the bad disco hangover ""If you leave me""?). However, the comparisons to Christina Agulera [sic] and others in the reviews below are sadly apropos. Without Bob and Pete, Sarah proves to be surprisingly plain - not in terms of her voice but in her musical choices and production. All the shag - bellbottoms, samplers, bad haircuts - that the boys add to the Saint Etienne material creates a tension, a frisson, with the lovely melancholia of Sarah's voice. Without that tension, Sarah comes across as a decent (but hardly exceptional) pop singer. Believe me, I love Saint Etienne. But I only like Sarah Cracknell's _Lipslide_."
4,I would have given this 5 stars BUT....,"Without question, ""Lipslide"" is a fantastic, uplifting, 5-star album..... in its original form. For folks in the U.S. who are interested in purchasing this, I suggest a) buying the U.K. version, or b) buying this U.S. release PLUS the follow-up ""Kelly's Locker"" EP.For some inane reason, the U.S. record label removed some of the best tracks from the import and substituted them with tracks that really aren't as good. Thankfully, the omitted songs do show up on ""Kelly's Locker"".... either way people are stuck shelling out a little more cash, but in the end its worth it.WHY the U.S. record companies continuously ignore good music because of its ""lack of commerciality"" is beyond me, and why there was a 2 1/2 year gap between the British release of the album and the American release is an even bigger mystery.If you want REAL sunny, breezy, intelligent POP music, throw out that awful Christina Aguilera & Mandy Moore - this chick this the REAL DEAL."
5,"Pop Fans, Buy This Now!","Sarah Cracknell's Lipslide has been floating about on import for about three years now, in various configurations, but the long-awaited US release by INSTINCT nails it. The artwork is divine, the bonus video is superb, and the tracklisting remains stunning. Songs like Anymore, Coastal Town, and Home are above-average pop symphonies, and Ready or Not,4 Months, 2 Weeks show the warm heart beating below the synths. The Japanese version of this album contains many more tracks and B-sides, but I feel the US release is more consistent. I can't wait to hear Sarah's next album with Saint Etienne, but until then, Lipslide will more than tide me over. Excellent, buy it now!"
5,An illuminating and honest account,"Adam Boren has written a testimonial of the horrors of the Holocaust that ought to be read by all Jews and all Americans. In a simple dispassionate prose Mr. Boren tells of the horrible events that occured to him. Further, by contrast with many Holocaust writings, Mr. Boren remained always active. He fought, first to escape, then against the Germans in Warsaw, and finally to take any moral opportunity to stay alive. This is not an account of passivity. Mr. Boren's story is especially heartwrenching because he was only 12 years old when the Holocaust began. This first hand account of teenagers experience rings through in our own age to help us take account of the blessings in our own lives and to always be alert and prevent such a tragedy from ever occuring again."
5,There's Always Hope,"I just three days I read and experienced one of the most meaningful writings ever exposed to me. I couldn't put it down! Not only did it give me a feeling of hopefulness against all odds, it helped me to minimize many of the circumstances I thought overwhelming. Little in my life could compare to the bravery that the author displayed in his quest for survivial. It is extremlely well-written, and a must for anyone, young and old, who wants to get a real look at the suffering dealt to the Jews of the Holocaust.Kudos to the author for sharing his memories in a way that will be everlasting in my mind."
1,An Amazing Man & An Amazing Book,"Truly Mr. Boren is an amazing individual to have overcome so much horror. The book is written so well and I felt as if I was there with him. His descriptions of the friendships that made during those difficult times were very touching. It made me realize that even during the most inhumane of time people do not necessarily need to lose their soul and their ability to feel.I could not put the book down...Thank You for putting your pain on paper - it is through people like Mr. Boren that the future generations will be able to ""witness"" the atrocities of the Shoah.Michal Gitman"
4,Predicting Sales Performance,"A solid study of what makes top performing salespeople, sales managers, and leaders. Applicable to many fields. Most beneficial to larger corporations, but plenty to take in for small business with 5 or less salespeople too. It's not an easy read, I suggest reading it a couple chapters at a time. Even though the authors main business is selling psychological testing, they did not push that too much in the book."
3,"Great book, but...","The title promises more than the inside, this book is full of information but is incomplete, in fact, this book is a giant brochure of the services the author's company is offering. If you want the complete info, then contact and hire their services.despite of this, this book has good info and good ideas, it gives you clues for what and what not to look when you hire salesmen, but i would like something more instructive and more practical... more info to put directly at work.I am a salesman manager, and like many others i have problems to hire good sales personal and make them produce, so this book looked to me as the solution i was looking for... Very close, but it wasn't."
1,Didn't like book at all,"I didn't care for this book at all. I think it is a very well written book, for TEACHERS, but not for a parent who is transracially adopting a child. I was looking for a book on how I would parent an African American child and this book was more of a textbook. I think it is very misleading to have it labeled as a ""must read for parents and teachers"" and it should be advertised as a book for teachers. I thought ""Inside Their Voices"" was much more informative about the experiences of a transracially adopted child."
3,Well written and interesting - with caveats,"The book is useful for non-blacks who have adopted or who teach black children. It is well-written and well-researched, follows a logical structure, and contains an interesting appendix which deals with the stages of race awareness.However.The title of this book is actually very misleading. In titling it as she did, the author assumed that the lives and experiences of biracial children and black children are the same. They're not. Not even close.This book has 268 pages of text, and only six deal with the issues of biracial children - interesting material, but hardly worth $13-14. You can essentially find the same information online for free.Save your money if you are the parent or teacher of a biracial child and are looking for assistance and insight because you will find very little of it here."
5,Super Book and Service,"Thank you for an easy, pleasant transaction. Good reading, truly a help to our bi-racial family"
1,We're not ice cream!,"Wow, the title alone is a turn off for me. As a biracial individual, I am little offended at the simplification of racial-identity as ice cream flavors. There are no how-to's for white parents raising Black children. It's complex and often painful, and that's what white parents need to know going into this."
5,amazing!,this book is asbolutely wonderful not only for children but for kids of all ages! i highly recommend this book!
5,CAPTIVATINGLY IMAGINATIVE,My 7 year old daughter and 5 year old son love this book! It is wonderfully imaginative and makes one think of folklore and legends passed down. The books illustrations are first rate and not just the run of the mill primary colored pictures seen in other childrens books. I think children ages 2 through 12 would really enjoy! My kids cannot wait to find a turtle now this spring and that is what reading it all about! We anxiously await more from this talented author.
5,Holiday Time - Anton Schwartz,"I'll never hear those old Christmas songs in quite the same way again! I agree with the critics - it's wonderful, expressive, innovative, and totally cool. It's good enough to listen to year round!"
1,Great Music but Terrible Format,"I really enjoy Richard Shindell's music but I can't stand the fact that this is being released as a CD-R and not a regular CD. CD-R's are just not that durable or suitable for longevity in a music collector's library. It's a shame that this is being treated as a disposable release. Even in small quantities the ""pressing"" of a CD is of minimal cost (less than 25 cents). I don't mind paying the artist and label their deserved $15.00 if it is a disc I want in my collection. I hope Richard or his label will reconsider how they are marketing his music. Downloadable files are great for those that want them, but if I buy a ""CD"" I want something of better quality that will last a lifetime, don't try to appease my desire for a hard copy by publishing a CD-R."
2,Am I missing something here?,"I am a RS fan since discovering him on a local radio station in Boston. I ran out and bought Reunion Hill, loved it and played it many times. As a guitarist/folkie myself, I highly recommend it & Sparrow's Point.I have seen him 5 times or so and I think he's a great talent.This album is another story. I enjoy melodic and harmonic music and I don't feel there are any songs except for maybe the covers that are worthy of listening over again. I do not like this album and can't recommend it. If you like songs that you can sing yourself they are not on this album."
3,A Peek Inside the Moulding of A Creative Mind,"It's interested peering into the upbringing of this most prolific and admired writer, written straight from the heart and without pretense, and demonstrating how her experiences and family and the places she went helped shape her stories."
1,I am sorry I just didn't get it,"I am a true believer in the practice of guided imagery but found this book was not in anyway helpful. I need more practical hands on with less yik yak about how successful the author has been in other cases. What about me, the reader, and what I need as opposed to what you have done for the supposed others out there."
2,NOT LIKED,I DISLIKED THE TEXT TO SPEECH VOICE READING THE WORD (PAUSE). IT DEFINITELY DETRACTED FROM THE TOTAL CONTENT OF THE BOOK..
1,Fabric Balls,Well written and easy to follow directions to make these fun fabric balls. It takes reading the instructions carefully and completely and going step by step and you'll love what you can do.
4,Patchwork Puzzle Balls,"A very interesting idea. The author describes a method to create 3D quilted objects. The patterns are very geometric and the methods to create them are clear and complete. The diagrams and photographs leads you through the process from start to finish. Ms. Beyer is a hand sewing advocate and this book and its patterns are designed to be hand sewn. However, she points out where us, machine piecers, can complete a ball. The book also provides a way to design your own shape and turn it into a 3D object.This book is a natural companion to her Tesselations book."
1,Worst RPG ever!,"I have to begin by saying that I'm a huge fan of both platform based RPG's and the more classic table top D&D. I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was with this game! The only reason it warrants 1 star is the fact that the character creation is so spot on to the new 3rd Edition rules. It just goes downhill from there. Usually I'm a fan of dungeon crawls, but this was just too repetitive.I didn't even bother finishing it before selling it :P"
2,Fairly dissapointing.,"Um... Yeah. I'm a huge D&D player, and I think this game stinks. There Is no in game music, (Trying to recreate the feel of a dungeon?) Basically most of the game is spent wandering around mindlessly, until combat, in which it's impossible to hit your enemys. around 80% of the time your charecter will end up getting slaughtered. Not worth the time or money. Get the real D&D books instead. Only buy this game if you wish to wander around and get slaughtered."
3,For hardcore fans only,Graphics below parSound below parGameplay is goodNostalgic of the good ol' days when D&D; games first came out on the 386Overall a good game made mostly tailored for D&D; fans.
1,Boring,I found it extremely boring...wandering around and then fighting.... yawn .... After playing GC Baldur's Gate and XBox D&D: Heroes this is really disappointing.I played it 1 hour and I'm going to trade it in.
2,Eye of Beholder D&D GBA,This game is too boring and not as good as the real board game. DONT BUY IT. You would have more fun buying the board games and actign them out.
4,come on d and d is a pen and paper game,"I am a big fan of pen and paper d and d (dungons and dragons) and I think that it should stick to just that, pen and paper. No video games that I've plyed have even come close to matching the fun of the 3rd edition game (yes even neverwind knights) to all who want another computer brain draining game go ahead and buy this game. But in my opinon go out and by the players handbook. Pen and paper D&D for ever!!!"
3,Too short for the money I paid,I originally played Eye of the Beholder for the SNES and never got too far in it. This gameboy advance version was almost identical to that game with the exception that when battles were engaged you were switched to an 3d overhead view. I went through this game over the weekend and was disappointed in how short it seemed. Total play time from start to finish was about 7 hours. Eye of the Beholder had a total of 10 or 11 levels. With a party of 6 adventurers I still had about two characters reach level 10 experience.At some point one of my characters had an AC of 145 after he acheived the 6th level. Even though I was wearing lots of magical items the cumulative AC should only have been about a 29 or 30. What I disliked the most was that no experience or treasure was awarded after I beat the final level. The game quickly ends and the credits roll. I got jipped. This was the first game I bought for the GameBoy Advance and I only wish it could have been longer.
2,Only for D&D players,"Traditional Gamer - See "" Golden Sun"" for more information. I""m sorry but this game this jusn't cut the muster with other games on the market. The game is slow and the combat system terrible. I've played D&D hundreds of times and if you like the game, you'll like this game. For me go elsewhere for enjoyment."
3,"Good for those who need, not for spying","Yes, it doesn't pinpoint properly, it's more omni-directional.The volume can go loud but for those who hear normally, it's distance is the same distance as your ears, so there's not much of an advantage, at least it's like this with the one I got.The design and sleekness is good, but it could be much better. I want to give the more expensive models a checkout.I think it's good for the need in hearing."
1,Absolutely useless,"It works only if you place the thing right in front of your mouth. The advertised range of the product is a complete farce. In summary, a completely useless thing. The positive is that it is really cheap, and you don't feel any effect on the wallet for the wasted money."
1,Got it from babysellsmusic. RIP OFF!,I bought spy ear from babysellsmusic (a user) and I followed the instructions on the back. I opened up the battery cover and pulled out the battery. Inside I found that the battery had corroded into the mechanism of the device. DO NOT BUY FROM BABYSELLSMUSIC! TOTAL RIP OFF.
4,Exploitation or not...,"Exploitaton or not, it's still an interpretation of some of my favorite, formative music. I'm one of those geeks who listened to Rush so much as a teenager that just hearing a brief melody from one of their songs causes a truly visceral reaction.I had always said that in 200 years, people will still listen to Rush and hearing the work interpreted through a string ensemble only strengthened that belief.Of course, I'm also a big fan of ""tribute"" albums. Some of my favorites being the ""Ecomonium"" tribute to Led Zepplin, the ""Moody Bluegrass"" Nashville tribute to the Moody Blues, and the ""Fire on the Mountain"" reggae interpretations of the Grateful Dead. Oh yeah, I'm also one of the few that really got a kick out of Rush's own tribute album, Feedback.In summary, if you love Rush and you enjoy tributes, buy this album. If not (on either account), skip it."
3,String Quartet - 'The String Quartet Tribute To Rush's 2112' (Vitamin Records),"At first, I thought this was a various artists - tribute title to Rush's landmark '2112' opus. But it's not - as I have discovered that the String Quartet has put out many tribute CD's as such. Paying homage to artists like Muse, U2, Queen, H.I.M., Creed, Moby, The Fray, Jimi Hendrix, Sonic Youth, Dave Bowie, - the list goes on. Trying to fair, I made the full attempt to get as much from this twelve track pick as I possibly could. Songs I did sort of like were the pretty-sounding ""Discovery"", the sappy ""Presentation"", ""Soliloquy"" which is actually good as is their rendition of ""A Passage Of Bangkok"" and ""The Twilight Zone"". Looked them up on the Internet and I found out they also go under the monicker of Vitamin String Quartet."
4,Intermission music,"Just letting you know that on the Snakes and Arrows tour, Rush is playing this music during their intermission."
1,Beware!!!!,Don't waste your money on this cd!!!The orchestration could have been done at a high school: very crude indeeed!There is a comical side to the cd but there are better cds to buy.Overall a very disappointing cd I have to agree with the other review that this is an exploitation cd. Reading the other reviews it looks like you either love it of hate it.My advice is stay away - you have been warned!
2,satisfying but unfulfilling,"I came to ""I Pass Like Night"" after reading ""The Extra Man"". ""The Extra Man"" was disturbing, comic, and sad. ""I Pass Like Night"" is just sad. Ames has great talent but he wastes them on characters who are not worth knowing. The world Ames describes is interesting but he hasn't made the characters sympathetic enough to hold your interest.I felt like a voyeur watching the couplings of others while reading the book. At no point was I interested in joining the fray. Mainly because Ames did not people the book with anyone attractive enough to entice me. My advice, skip this book and go right to ""The Extra Man""."
3,Thanks for the story but I do not know why you told me,"This is a slim volume with slim achievements. It intends to build a picture from a series of little stories that you and I might tell whilst waiting, for only a short time, at the bus stop. The shame is that it is well written. There are images from his current life, childhood and adolesence, private thoughts, people he loves, knows and meets on the streets. At first I decided that it was an overlong short story but, on reflection, realise that it is a framework upon which a proper novel could have been built. I know very little about this young man and do not care either. I met him at the bus stop, he told me his story de jour, I got on the bus and forgot him."
2,The glamour of a looser??,"Some anthropologists argue that one of the characteristics of humans is the need to rationalise its actions no matter how absurd and contradictory they might be. Here, the main character decides to be a looser, as a consequence of its sexual ambivalence. However the would like to be nearby were the glamorous and the powerful gather to eat so he becomes a porter at the Four Seasons hotel in New York surviving from the tips offered by the wealthy patrons. So far so good as the topic of a novel. However, the author is incapable to offer a physiological portrait of Alexander Vine. The book is not disturbing, it is not funny, it is not shocking. You might get more insight about the sexual underground of New York watching 5 minutes of Sex and the City than from this book."
4,Jumpstart Reading With Karaoke,"I have a 5 yr old and a 7 yr old who enjoy playing the game. The microphone is a big hit, and works well. Both my boys sang along at least five times when they got their first song on the jukebox. Listening to their voices made both of them really speak up, loud and clear. I was personally amazed that my 5 yr old spoke so clearly into the microphone. I feel the software was nicely made. By the fifth time they ask to complete the activity, I'm feeling like they are going to lose interest but they didnt, and my kids continued on."
1,Jumpstart Wouldn't Start,"My 6 year old got stuck on the first screen, I dont know if it was broken or not, the microphone is very flimsy, didn't seem to work she kept screaming her name into it, but she couldnt continue. If the microphone doesn't work you can't continue."
3,few drawbacks,"this software is pretty good except for the karaoke part. my daughter is three and half and finds it difficult to click on the mic (only while it flashes) and quickly say her part (before the fast moving blue stripe reaches the end).this could be a better software for bit older kids who can coordinate it faster. or a parent has to sit with the kid and help with the karaoke part. i feel, they should allow a bit more time for the kids to react and act especially when we are talking about younger kids.my daughter loves this software but gets frustrated with the coordination of the mic in short span of time."
4,reliable,"This watch is great for the money, but is missing some features that I think make it suitable. there's no light on it, which I knew, but thought it wouldn't matter much. Now owning it, i realize that it matters. I find that due to the ease in which it enters the mode in which the time changes, i often change the time accidentally."
4,Good enough for a sports watch.,"I am satisfied with this watch in every way except one: it is much smaller than I had anticipated. It is not tiny, but my wrists are large and it looks smaller than any men's watch I would like on my wrist. I bought this watch for the sole purpose of saving wear & tear on my dress watches, and will be worn only when running or cycling or motorcycling, etc. Otherwise the display is smallish but clear, the functions are simple (nothing more or less than I would ever need), so it's a decent digital sports watch. Great price. 4 stars"
2,user,"The watch band is way too short. I know the watch works well but I can't wear it. I bought a Casio neon with the same operational features, just a bit larger. That band is perfect."
3,Not as great as what we see in the picture published,It is smaller than what it is shown in the website.Quality is cheap.Watch is like a faded color.
4,Does the job.,I purchased ten of these watches for students who are in foster care homes and who need timing devices for ACT and SAT exams. Sad but true. They were welcome and used in taking exams. Seems proctors do not have timing devices nor do they let students know how time is passing during the exams.
1,Terrorist,"It's been known for quite a while now, but according to US intelligence, wearing the Casio F-91W is a potential sign of someone being a terrorist. There's a whole list of Guantanomo Bay detainees who wore the watch, an old Washington Post article that said terrorists can use the watch to create time bombs and leaked Wikileaks documents linking the watch to al-Qaeda:"
1,worst fabric softener ever,"Beware. This product will ruin your clothes. I've tried numerous times, using different settings, and this product leaves a greasy residue, and greasy spots on clothes. As another reviewer noted, some fabrics are more sensitive to this than others, although I think I've figured out what is going on. I've noticed that it does not disperse well in water. Instead, it ends up in small globs, that spread out, sticking onto fabric. I gave this product a shot, and I regret wasting my money, not to mention the ruined clothing.On a side note- many people buy Method products thinking they are using a product that is environmentally sensitive, and free from harmful chemicals. Do your research. This company uses ""green wash"", meaning they pretend to be a natural product, when in reality, they use artificial dyes and ""optical brighteners"", which are anything but natural."
3,softner,I like a little bit more fragrance and it seems to be a little week on the static control. You need to use a little more than I thought you would have to.
2,Too thick!,"This fabric softener is so thick, that it clogs my softener dispenser! I love the detergent, so I thought I'd like this, but it's a no-go."
4,A different kind of music,"I purchased this CD because I loved the theme song to MTV's ""Daria"", which is ""You're Standing on My Neck"". At first, the vocals sounded a little too perky and upbeat for me, but once I got more into the CD it was GREAT!If you look at the CD from a different perspective, it's kinda cool, because the way they sing the songs, they sound perky, but if you listen closely to the lyrics, they're actually more alternative. And the music is awesome! I guess you could consider it to be pop-rock.The songs ended up becoming kind of catchy and the music was just awesome! You just have to give this CD a chance and listen to it a second time so you can really get into the music.If you want to listen to something different and are looking for a change in the regular music you usually hear, you should definately buy this CD. Just don't get your hopes up."
4,Classic 90's girl-grunge,"Very good CD that really shows off one of the last albums released in the 90's by an all-girl grunge band. Recommended to fans of Hole, L7, Veruca Salt, The Breeders etc."
1,Being a mom...,"I must admit that being a mom is a hard job. But, I love my children and my life. Please do not think that these comics are true for all parents. My children love me, hug and kiss me and tell me how wonderful I am. I know this will change in teenage years... but, I will cling to these times. And, I do have to scream more than one sometimes. :)"
1,ASB 2004 is the worst baseball game ever,"this game was supposed to be online capable but its not. i spent 50 bucks on this game and i took it back to [my local store]. and i e-mailed acclaim who is the maker of ASB, and its been 3 weeks and they havent sent me one response. so in conclusion dont buy this ... game"
5,Best Baseball Game Hands Down,"I recently rented this game because of all the mixed reviews I read and I didn't want to buy a game that I wouldn't end up playing. But this is by far the best baseball game out right now. There are many different options in this game compared to MVP(some say better than ASB) And as far as the hitting goes, I actually think it was easy to pick up on and it's realistic. If your batter is good against righty then the batting icon is larger than when he faces a lefty, And that chages from player to player. I don't own and hardly play baseball games but this game made me enjoy baseball much more than I thought I could. The only downside is that high 90's fastballs are incredibly hard to hit (once the pitcher gets tired its gets easy) and there are more errors that there should be (still its not hard to deal with) but other than those two things I can't complain. So I give ASB 2004 a 5 star and proclaim it as the best baseball came out, hands down!"
4,"Overall Enjoyable, minor issues","I am a basesball fan and when the 2003 baseball lineup came out, I knew that I was going to buy this game. I enjoyed playing ASB 2003, and I knew that 2004's edition would have improvements. The graphics are nice, and the announcers are as well. The franchise is pretty detailed even allowing you to play a dozen or so spring training games, the only problem is the shotty AI, and some game crashes. Also some calls the umpires make are unreal and don't make much sense.Overall this is a good game, and if you enjoy watching baseball, and are a fan, get this game, or wait until ASB 2005 which I'm sure is even better."
4,2003 WAS A LOT BETTER,"I can't believe there are some people who give this game 5 stars. I have played ASB games for years now and 2003 is the best one yet. What did they do with the camera angle? How about the lousy frame rate? How about catching the ball 3 feet from your glove? No, no, no, this game is NOT 5 STARS, do not confuse consumers please! It has cool things like mound visits and pitcher worm ups but the gameplay sucks. Baseball is about pitcher versus batter duel. THERE IS NO SUCH THING IN THIS GAME. If you want a pitcher-batter duel get MVP 2003. The gameplay is fast but at least you get to pitch like a pro."
4,A good game with few flaws,"The all star seiries is one of the more enjoyable I have played, the expansion/franchise mode is exceptionally enjoyable. However it does have its flaws. While the pitching is better than most games the hitting is worse, it seems the balls take paths and always end up in the same places, 90% of the time in a feilders glove, hitting homers is fun and easy in this game as well.Overall a good game but the gameplay could have been improved."
1,very annoying,"This game is graphically impressive with a very good presentation. Unfortunately, the game play leaves much to be desired. The batting is far too difficult and the number of fielding errors made is very annoying. There is also a delay when trying to advance base runners which results in way too many unneccessary pick offs and throw outs. Base runners constantly get caught like idiots between bases. Don't buy this game."
4,"I think I need ""spidey sences"", I CAN'T GET A HIT!!!","All-Star Baseball 2003, What can I say. Graphics- great. Features- Outstanding. Gameplay- Someone cry me a river! The reason this game gets 1 star is because this games gameplay is at an all time low! And as we all know you can't have fun in a game that has horrible gameplay. First off, the battin coursor. You have to guess where the pitch will be thrown before the ball is pitched (duh) and if you have ""Spidey Sences"" piece o' cake! But I'm no super hero. This means if you get lucky, you'll get between 2 and 4 hits after 9 inings. Pitching isn't great nor is it a disaster waiting to happen, kinda in the middle. There's not much to be said about it. I wanted to rent MVP Baseball 2003 but got stuck with the only baseball game in stock this one! if you want a great baseball game AVOID ALL-Star Baseball 2003! Now I'm gonna continue shopping on Toys R US.com and buy MVP Baseball 2003."
1,stinx!,"this game is the worse baseball game i ever played. the graphics are good, but the gameplay, mainly batting, is impossible. you have to guess where the pitch is before you swing, and their arent special pitches or anything. if you want to buy a sweet game 4 people who wanna sit down & start hittin homers, get mlb slugfest 20-04."
5,The BEST BASEBALL GAME SO FAR,This game does it all...great gameplay cool graphics and too many game options that makes this game really cool...
2,Play it if you like pitching so much.,"This game left me extremely dissapointed. I thought that it might be a little better than the horrible 03 but its pretty much the same. The bad thing about this game is how it's almost impossible tro hit the ball. Oh yeah maybe the guess the pitch option (which stinks) might help if you know how to use it. How are they going to expect you ti hit the ball when it comes in 95 and you still have to get the batting triangle from the middle to the top or bottom.Not to say that it is a bad game completely (which it still is) because the graphics sre actuallt the best in the buissness.When is it gonna be the time when ASB is going to come out with a game that is fun to play like the great and I meen great ASB 01. Make the game like that and with the advanced graphics and you""ll actually have a game that will sell."
5,great game,This is one of they best baseball games i have ever played. This game is not only fun but also challanging. You have to work to get runs and to hit home runs. The pitching on this game is wounderfull. I think the batter actually learns your pitches. And beleive me when you play against the computer it is not easy (even when you have the batter on easy mode. I also like that there are real time errors. Sometimes a player just looses the ball in the sun and can't get to it. I also like the general manager options. It makes you feel like you are right in the gm office making all the decisions for the team. I also like the fact that there is spring tranning. Many baseball games do not incorporate that this one does. The game is so realistic there are even weaviers in the game. This is really a top notch game. I Suggest that you get it.
2,Overrated,"I bought this game the day it was release in great anticipation of a great baseball game. I was sorely disappointed. Unless you have the reflexes of Mr. Miagi from Karate Kid, you can't get a hit. Even when you switch it to easy batting, you can't get a quality hit for anything. It has great features, and neat things to play around on, but the gameplay is for the birds. Go out and buy High Heat 2004 or even better MVP 2004. They are much better."
2,WARNING DO NOT BUY tons of glitches and unreal plays,when i first got this game i thought that it would fix all the glitches from last years game. I was wrong. In this game you will see the players catch the ball with their feet and other body parts. ONE THING THAT IS TERRIBLE IN THIS GAME IS THAT THE CPU ALWAYS ROBS YOU ON UNREAL CATCHES AT LEAST ONCE AN INNING. IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET A HIT BECAUSE OF THIS. i would only recommend this game to people with lots of patience also to people who dont get [angry] at video games at all...
3,go with High Heat '04,"Although it is undoubtedly the greatest game I have ever played on the field (smooth and realistic), you cannot adjust the length of your season and number of innings played per game. If you don't like to simulate dynasty/franchise games you have to play a full spring training, 162 games and playoffs!!! Also - the contract and minor league system is pretty weird, not to mention difficult at best. Players have 'points' that determine their value. ...."
1,This game [stinks]!!!,This game has a horrible glich that doesn't let you hit. Even if you put it on auto aim you can't tell what pitch it is because you can't swing late. You have to swing the bat right when the ball is relesed from the pitcher's hand. Don't play this game or buy it
3,"Useful, but not useful enough for the price","This is a REPRINT of the 1984 book, so no peerages that have become extinct since then (and in at least one instance during 1984) are listed as such. The dates of extinction are ONLY by year, no month or day. It's useful to have in one's library, but I'd recommend looking for a used copy."
4,Good for ready-reference,"A compact ready-reference source which connects surnames with British titles (barons and above), and vice versa, up to the present. The Howard family, for instance, has been connected with more than thirty titles, while seven different families have held the earldom of Sussex."
2,It had a good start but then...,"""Black Light"" gets off to a good start. I like the way the author brings the dotcom world into the story. The character development is pretty good too.Once the two main characters head to Massachusetts though, things start to fall apart. The characters didn't really seem to develop for the rest of the story. A lot of what they did and said seemed very one-dimensional.I was especially disappointed with the ending. It seemed very derivative of other books I've read and movies I'd seen, and was very predictable. Plus, the time travel element seemed like kind of a cop out, as if the author had gotten to that point and then didn't know what to do next. An example of how a time travel element was better used is at the end of Dean Koontz's book ""Lightning.""This author has potential, but needs to flesh things out better in their next novel."
4,A must have for any collector of the Fillmore posters.,"Now you can see just how beautiful these rock posters are. Each poster in the Fillmore series is presented in full color. An excellent tool to guide you in your purchases, or just help you to enjoy these works of art. Excellent information on the artists and some cool insights into the people and the place that was the Fillmore west."
4,Art of the FIllmore - Posters 1966-1971,"As a person who attended some of the shows represented by the posters, I loved the book. It brought back many, many memories and inspirations. The book captured the essence of Bill Graham as an entrepreneur and, as it turned out, supporter of the arts.Not a book for everyone, but if you were there, or you think you wanted to be there, this is a great value."
1,Ebook version in black and white,The rating is for the ebook version. I would give the paper version 5 stars. I own the paper version and wanted the electronic version to study on the go. Imagine my surprise at finding the book was not in the glorious psychedelic colors of the original but in bad black and white. There is no mention of this in the description and I feel ripped off. So buyer beware
2,Too dark,"The poster is not as portrayed on the website. The bottom half is almost black. You can't see the seat and it is too dark, even in sunlight or via our light over the poster. Cheap, yes, but a disappointment."
5,An amazing CD,I have listened to this CD so much- it is the best Putumayo CD by far. It has the most gorgeous jazzy pop songs from Paris. My kids love it too. We've listened to it on road trips for hours on end because it was so much better than any other CDs. You have to get it!
4,French Connection,Love this CD! Really lifts my mood and makes me feel in touch with the world. Excellent as a background when entertaining and also really enjoyable when having a glass of wine and relaxing on your own. Nice cross-section of tracks too.
5,Great collection,This is a great collection if you like chanson or just want to expand your musical horizons. I listen to everything from Beethoven to Kid Rock and like pretty much all Putumayo releases for the latter.
4,The hottest music from france?,"After reading the editorial review, I had to laugh. The hottest new musical movements around the world are many, and these movements occur in regions all over the globe.The hottest musical movement in France, is the new electro funk, jazz, and pop, rock that comes from new artists like Daft Punk, Air, Alex Kid, St Germain, Phoenix, Terrasse Tranquille, Molecule, Oscar, Bob Sinclair, etc. I mean come on, the french chanson is nice and sweet but is not some hot new musical movement. Vive Edith Piaf! But, lets not forget the real new musical movement that is happening in France. Check out Paris under a groove, or paris lounge for a reference. enjoy."
1,paris,why do you require how many words we write. i hated this CD. see my comment on italian cafe. ok.
5,Sweet,This music made me swoon with joy as it evoked images of Paris. Excellent combination of vocal artists and musical flow.
3,Good background soundtrack,"It's a nice little soundtrack to listen to while sipping champagne and eating Brie. Some were not to my liking, but most were pleasant."
4,fun typical music,no surprises and yet fun to listen to would recommend it to those who are getting ready for their first trip tp Paris....
1,Installation issues with Linux 64 bit,"I had purchased this product with great expectations. Like many other user's I have made attempts to remove myself from the MS$ products. Unfortunately there appears to be an issue with installing this on some Linux 64 bit systems. I am running SUSE version 10.2 and I am unable to successfully install this product. I would have thought with the latest version of SUSE and the latest version of Star Office 8 these types of issues would have been resolved in the beta process. I have found many forums out there where users have bumped into the same thing, however I have not found any solution. At this point in time it appears I have spent the money but will not have a useable product.I will be contacting StarOffice support to see if it can be worked out, if it can be, and they produce a product that can be installed for everyone of all operating systems, I will be more than happy to update my review. For now, depending on what you are running proceed with caution."
1,Does not work without Java & errors.,"Well, it does not convert over to excel correctly,it leaves ###### in all the cells, wonderfully allof my data was LOST or ruined by this!This will be a nice coaster for my end table."
5,Excellent replacement for microsoft office,"i was going to actually purchase microsoft office for my office but reading the spotlight review there made me consider buying star office instead.and boy i'm glad i did,star office has more features,easy to use interface,for a MUCH lower price.dear reader:don't go for microsoft office,instead buy this one,you will not be dissapointed.oh and thank you amazon for letting your customers write reviews on your products,it definitely helped us out a whole lot:)"
4,Great MS Office Alternative,"I bought this to upgrade from StarOffice 7 to 8. I've always been very happy with StarOffice as a less-expensive alternative to MS Office. The default format in version 7 was StarOffice format. In version 8, it's open-document format. So far, I've been able to open any MS Office 2000 document in StarOffice 8 without any serious differences. My only complaint with this product is that, even with the ""Quickstarter"" running in the system tray, the program takes twice as long as MS Office to open. If Sun could make it launch as fast or faster than MS, I would gladly give it five stars."
1,you get what you pay for,"I very cheap TV. After using it in the kitchen for about a week, it has now been taken out of service and has become another storage item. I would not recommend purchasing one."
5,This will work ver well.,This TV will work very well for about a month. Hey everybodys complaining about it only working a little. It cost 16 freaking dollars. Yall need to open yall eyes. It is cheap so it wont last as long as the earth that he has given ye. Hello!! Is there any brains in the world. It was very nice to own this project.
1,Buyer Beware,The TV played out after one (1) month of use. Not daily use either. Pure junk. Don't buy it unless you have money you just want to throw away.
2,Less than useful,I purchased this TV on February 28. It worked fine for about one week and then the picture tube began dying. As of the last week it will only work for about 20 seconds and then go black. This also apparently affecte the audio portion of the circuit which will be unintelligible from static. On the whole even considering the price this is not a purchase I would recommend. On the other hand if the thing worked as it did for the first week it would be a good item for the price.
2,it had a problem,"I bought this item refurbished for 12 bucks. I hooked it up fo a coby travel-sized dvd player. I bought this for my home gym & I'm happy that it has no issues playing my cds or dvds... however there was a rather large issue recieving on-air television signals. the picture was clearer then I expected but, even at full power, the sound could not be raised beyond a (barely audible) whisper. this set would be worthless had I planned on using it to recieve tv.I forgot to test the radio.I'm happy with my purchase, but I would NOT recomend it.update:the radio works very well. the speakers aren't so great but I used the headphone jack to plug in a set of computer speakers. the stations come in nicely but some stations are impossible to find, probably due to the unit's small size."
1,Waste of money,"I've had multiple problems with this TV. Horizontal lines not in sync, picture fades out, poor reception, very poor quality. I got what I paid for but wish I had shopped a bit longer to get a better TV.Don't waste your money."
2,you get what you pay for,"I got this little tv so that we can watch sports games while we are driving long distance. However, it did not catch any signals. Even at home, we could only get two channels if we are really lucky. I don't know how this will work as a emergency kit if it does not catch any signals. Now it is just taking up space in our garage."
2,Handle with care.,"I received first unit with a broken tuner knob. Amazon's return policy is very easy, although it took longer to receive than first shipment. The second unit works fine, but seems like it would break easy if not very careful. Good price."
4,Good little TV for hurricane season,"Hey, for only $18 - if it's used only once, will be worth it's weight in gold. It's B/W - so don't get excited if you think you're going to watch movies or play games in technicolor. But at least you'll be able to see what the news reporters are saying when they report, ""and look what the winds have done here..."". And it's a nice bonus that you have both TV and radio in one unit."
2,Won't do that again!!,"Let's first understand that we're talking about a $14.50 TV. By itself this is not the most complex item in the world nor does it cost that much. The reason I called this review ""Won't do that again"" is because of the money involved. Follow the bouncing ball -- I bought two little TV's at a cost of [do the math] $29.00. My total bill was $69.00, you see there was a $40.00 add on for shipping and handling. Next time it's off to Circuit City, there the TV's are $20.00 and all you do is walk out the door.You asked!"
4,"Coby CX - TV1 5"" B/W",The product was delivered on time. It's great to watch TV next to my computer. Channel 2 comes in fuzzy but that is alright. It is also good to have around when the power goes out.
2,Not Great,Antena broke as soon as I touched it. It is glued together now. Picture is good on only one channel.
1,Please don't bother!,"One star is too many! (It should be negative one). This sad excuse for a television/radio has to be the worst piece of lame crud I have ever bought in my entire life. Picture fades into black, terrible reception which fades in and out as you move about the room, smells like burning plastic after a half-hour, and so on. Please, Amazon shoppers, don't waste any money on this! You might just as well throw the $15 out the window. Step up to something more reliable from a better manufacturer."
5,No Rating,Unable to rate this product just yet. It is a christmas gift and until after Christmas will I be able to rate this product. Please email again after the holiday and ask me then.
2,Yuk,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. Toouning is awful if not impossible. I could only get two or three stations. Find a better product."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this item on 11/12/2008 and it was broken when I received it. And the tv stopped working today, 01/19/2009 and I am very disappointed and upset."
2,More country than blues,"I have heard a number of Sonny Landreth songs that were definitely more blues oriented and very decent songs, so I bought this cd expecting a lot. I was really disappointed with this collection of his earlier works. It is about as close to blues as N'Sync is to rock. It is almost pure country and as someone who really despises country music, I very much disliked it, even after giving it three or four spins in the player. However, I gave it two stars because I think that someone who does like country music and a bit of the blues might also like this disk."
2,Im really not sure,I just didn't feel that this was a very strong collection. It has its moments but it never really got me.
5,Lovin' the lucious Mary kay Paradise Lipstick!,"Let's face it, you can't get much better than Mary Kay for cosmetics and perfume!Glides on smooth with a lavish pink color!"
4,Great Quality,"I found this brand of Karaoke CD's to be the best I have purchased so far. The music is more true to the actual performers, and the music contains the ""back-up"" singers that some Karaoke CD's do not include. This makes it easier to sing along, and also makes you sound a bit better! ;)"
3,Beware of missing songs.,"Great disk, lots of fun songs. However, not all the songs listed on this web page are on the actual CDGs. Somewhat disappointing with regard to the missing songs (Imagine, Joy to the World, Let It Be, Love Hurts, Macho Man, Soul Man, We've Only Just Begun, YMCA)."
1,Warning: Song list not as noted on website,This CD did not have all the song titles that were listed under the description! Very disappointing!
3,Half-Familiar,"I only liked 7 out of 39 songs, but, that's my own preference... they have a fairly good selection to reach out to different listeners...I DID appreciate the fact that the titles were listed...Not another GRABBAG!!!"
2,ugh!,"The play quality of this player is, really, quite good...so long as you don't mind really annoying buzzing sounds every minute or so. For some reason the anti-skip feature really doesn't work for very long and, if on for a while, it will stop playing the CD and just have this really annoying buzz sound, that will only go away if you take off the anti-skip (which really defeats the purpose of it). I would not reccomend this product to anyone looking for a good CD player...it's not worth it."
1,Worst CD player EVER,"This CD player wont work in the car, it wont work when I'm sitting on the train at times because of the slight vibration, it hardly works when I'm walking, in general, it should only be used if your going to leave it on a table or something flat and never touch it while it's in play mode. The bass boost makes everything sound distorted, the anti-shock is a total joke, and on top of everything, it's bigger and heavier then the average portable CD player.My advice to you, buy this item for someone you want to avoid for the rest of your life."
3,Gladiator Garage Works Tool Hook,The hook 'fingers' felt a bit longer than I originally imagined and protrudes from the wall considerablly. The construction seemed sturdy and the finishing is solid. Also the 'fingers' could have been slightly wider.
1,Tom tom Navigator 6 Map accuracy...???,"I purchased a Tomtom Navigator 6 with Navibe GPS receiver about 40 days ago. The feel of the navigator software is very nice. The Navibe GPS receiver is very nice too... However, the map accuracy is not as it is stated in the publicity. The maps may be good for the major cities of the US, but if you are to come to Canada with this Tomtom Navigator 6, you will find that they are decades behind with respect to their competitor (NAVTEQ, GARMIN) Also, be aware that the palm TX, Lifedrive, etc are not considered compatible by Tomtom and therefore free map updates are not available... I recommend to NOT purchase this item."
5,Very Informative and Helpful,"Lots of helpful information in this book. It's surprising to learn how ""normal ranges"" are derived in labratories and how and to whom your medical information is disseminated. Anyone having bloodwork done, for prevention or diagnosis, should take a look at this book first."
3,"Funny, good book","Johnny Blue and the Texas Rangers is a funny, easy to read western book for just about anyone. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. Full of adventure and excitement, this book is a fun read."
4,Good retro head banging,"This was a good addition to an 80s themed party for those former headbangers. Brought up some cool memories, especially for the guys."
5,Great Songs,"I have to admit first that some of these songs are more ballad-like than rock. That being said, I still loved all the songs. They are all really big hits from the 80's. The artists include Warrant, Poison, Quite Riot, Twisted Sister, and Night Ranger."
4,Have it on tape,This is a pretty good album. There was a few songs thatdon't fit. But when you have a collection of songs likeFinal Countdown/Cum feel the Noise/Poison just to namea couple then you have a winner.
5,simply the best compilation album in years,awesome! a must-have for eighties-lovers like me. brings back so much memories. a great selection of tunes.
5,A Hell Of Alot Better Then The So Called 80's CD's U Get For A Nickle,"I love this music and cd, yes there are some head scratchers that shouldn't be here like the Cutting Crew, Asia or .38 Special, but than again it was they in the beginning who helped shape the 80's future in the late 70's, so the deserve to be here as well. There are alot of good times on this cd collection that you can't help but think back to a simplier time, and still stands the test of time and still helps the party get rolling today. All the way from .38 Special's 1981 Hold on Loosly, Cheap Tricks 1978 Surrender, Rainbow's 1985 Stone Cold, Warrent's 1990 Cherry Pie down to Firehouse's 1995 Love Of A Lifetime.Great F**king cd all the way around, may be there can be a follow up with artist say Ozzy, Riot, Hurricane, Kix, Junkyard, and Dangerous Toys to name a few. ROCK ON!!!!"
3,Should some of this stuff be on here?,"I like the others, think some of this stuff should have been saved for the Monster Ballads C.D.Then there are some who have no need to be here at all.I for one think putting Autograph on here at all just shows why this music died the death it did.They should have been on the Monster one hit too many C.D.38 SPECIAL????Good band,wrong C.D. to be on!Dont get me wrong,it's a good disc but too disjointed with ballads and pop songs.It could be worse, it could be Monster Alternative Hits!"
2,"Love the size, but...","Well, I plunged into the LCD market for my desktop machine and purchased this monitor from Amazon. I love the size of the display and the quick power (no warming up like the old CRT) and I also liked the ease of adjusting the display with the AUTO mode being perfect. My main reasons for a low rating include the text shadowing on Win2kPro which wasn't correctable, although I managed to get used to it and probably could have managed if that alone was the issue. The critical issue was the screen jitters - while the text was shadowed, the text moving on the screen is very annoying and causes additional eye strain. This wasn't an issue for the games, those worked fine or the movement was unnoticed, but for programming work, it really hurt the eyes. I am sad to see it go because the size and color was awesome and I have to go back to a 17"" crt which is really 16"" display, until I find a unit which doesn't suffer from these issues."
4,On the subject of forgiveness,This book really gave me insight into the issue of forgiveness. Can one person forgive in the name of thousands who were offended?
3,Smoke & Strong Whiskey,"Typical Christy Moore album. Good lyrics, good music, but the recording could have used a bit more life in it. Christy Moore fans will enjoy it. Newcomers may be ambivalent about it."
3,Renaldo says it's a'ight!,"Noreaga's solo album is cool, although I personally can't listen to it all the way through. ""Superthug"" is probably one of the best and innovative songs on the album, produced by the Neptunes who are responsible for Mase's ""Lookin' at Me"" and the Lox's ""If You Think I'm Jiggy (remix)"". The title song also cranks, along with ""The Assignment"" feat. Busta Rhymes. Some of the beats are a little monotonous and Nore's voice can get a little unbearable, but N.O.R.E. is definitely worth checking out."
4,"Good, but not as good as CNN","Nore's debut is good, but is nowhere near as phat as CNN's ""War Report."" War Report was almost Nore's first solo since Capone was up north for most of the making of the album. I thought Banned From TV and The Assignment really stood out and NORE, Hed, 40 Island, The Change, Superthug, and Body in the Trunk were all pretty good as well. But, I Love My Life and The Way We Live were totally wack. CNN's ""Closer"" was a good mix of rap and R&B, but these two songs are not. I thought Fiesta and Mathematics were just blatant attempts at party songs, but they are still okay. Its Not a Game and Da Story are alright, but need work. All in all its a good CD, but I personally can't wait until Capone comes back and CNN drop again."
3,DECENT but NOT great!,"this album is carried by lyrics that are great and mostly that's it. i will give him credit because ""banned from tv"" and ""superthug"" are so well done that the album seems dissapointing. there are a few others that are well done but for the most part it is attacking, incredable lyrical skills on every track but whoever says that every song has good beats is on crack! see i listen to lots of death row/ westside connectionish, dirty south and some east rap. see besides wu-tang, bone thugs, the ruff ryders and the terror squad there reallly isn't that many GREAT rappers but there's a million good lyricists from the big apple. if you want noreaga when he is making REAL rap go get the new one it is ten times better and it actually has good beats!"
3,Not what I expected,"I'm not sure about Nore. I think this kid got potential to rip a wicked verse. This album has some hot joints. Tracks like Body in the Trunk, and The Story are hard joints with hot lyrics and wicked production. However, some tracks you have to press the fast foward button on your discman or walkman. Banned from TV and Superthug does not help much and doesn't fit to Noreaga's expectations. Just what for the CNN reunion album to come through. With the CNN sophmore album, the chemistry will be there, phatter rhymes and production and maybe I may play part of this album. Queensbridge and Lefrak connection baby."
3,What Happened NORE...?!?!,"First off the bat...the production needed some work...there only a few gems which are dropped. First off is 'Banned from TV' which is one of the best posse cuts I have heard on an album since 'Live at the BBQ' Ruff Ryders comes through with a glaring horn synth and crisp beats. Then you get to the hard ish 'NORE' with a deep violin. Near the middle of the album is where it fails...'Fiesta'? come on now NORE...?!?! But the Ones that outshine the most are ""Body in the Trunk' With Nas and Nore tryin' to dispose of a dead body. (with hilarious nore tryin' to use lysol and ish!??!) and Assignment feat. Bussa Buss. Overall with a few weak beats and repetitive lyrics, NORE still holds it down with capone in the bin. But next time get your old producers back (Nashiem, Marley, etc. and get a joint with Mobb Deep!?!? did we forget 'the infamous' that quickly?!?)Peace..."
3,"WHAT, WHAT","Original sound. That is what made Nore shine. Other than that he only gets 3 stars. I heard the War Report and I've heard N.O.R.E. and now this original sound is getting old. His style grows tired after the first 4 cuts. If it wasn't for Nas on the track, ""Body In The Trunk"" I would have put this CD at the bottom of my collection. However, he had other cool tracks. Esta Loca was a head banger. I liked the way he let go on that one. ""The Way We Live"" with Chico Debarge had potential, but Chico killed it with his singing. L.E.S. fu*ked up big time sampling ""Caravan of Love"" for the song. Just as Snoop needs Dre, Victor Santiago needs Kiam Holley to really shine. 19 tracks of Nore over and over can't cut it."
4,Phat beats and lyrics,"This CD is good from start to end with songs like Banned from TV, NORE, Hed, It's Not A Game, Superthug, Mathematics and Body in the Trunk, except for a couple wack songs you should definetly buy this CD"
3,Ain't no War Report,"Nore is my man and I got the album on its release date tricked into believing that this was going to be another War Report. Boy was I wrong. Don't get me wrong, the album is tight but can't even compare to his debut with Capone. Big ups on ""Banned From TV"" and ""Head"""
4,N.O.R.E. reppin his own raw style,"A lot of people don't like this album because they compare it to ""War Report."" N.O.R.E.'s flows to me sound completely different without Capone, so you gotta take the album for what its worth. Noreaga has a solid album with N.O.R.E., highlighted by his successful track ""Superthug."" A Neptune beat, NORE basically shows other emcees the way on Superthug, in my opinion he's the first to truly kill a Neptune beat.A lot of people been hatin on N.O.R.E.'s style, saying his flows are ignorant. To me that's just people gettin in a musical rut. They used to common flows that are likeable by a large group of people, like Nelly, Fabulous, or even Jay-Z. N.O.R.E. reps what he knows, and he knows grimey, raw, street corner flows. His rhymes might not be socially conscious, but at least he keeps it real. I know I'll be lookin for Grimey God's Favorite when it drops, N.O.R.E. will at the very least drop some head bobbin, fun joints to rock with your homies. (...)"
4,Solo,"Noreaga's debut solo album is a very good effort. I consider the Neptunes produced ""Super Thug"" to be nothing but garbage, but apart from that he really puts together this album very well. ""I Love My Life"" is a beautiful story about him growing up. Not that Nore is the greatest lyricist around, but this track touched me anyways. Carl Thomas supplied the hook. ""40 Island"" featuring Musolini & Kool G Rap is a track the basically is a remix of the track ""Rikers Island"" that was made by the same Kool G Rap whom is featured here.Nas appears on ""Body In The Trunk"", a story about... well you figure it out for yourself. Other guests include: The Lox, Cam'ron, the decased Big Pun, Nature, Maze, Busta Rhymes and others...Great album, but nowhere near as good as ""The War Report""."
3,mabey even 3.5 stars,"superthug and n.o.r.e are awesome songs, but i only gave this cd a 3 star bacause of how much filler tracks there were, just buy the single of n.o.r.e. and try to download superthug on your computer"
3,O.K. Album,"This is an O.K. album but there was alot of weak tracks. But I gave it 3 stars because it has some good songs like Superthug, 40 Island, and NORE. I would rather get ""The War Report"" but if you already own The War Report then it would be good to buy this album."
1,Wuz wrong wit Nore?,"Nore starts rappin and he sounds like my grandmother always talkin bout ""wha wha"". He sounds like he's got a hearing problem. Give him a hearing aide instead of a mic."
3,"If you work with an elder as a social worker, read this!","This book is very informative and positive about helping elders. Roberta Greene knows what she is talking about. The odd thing about this book, though, is that the figures are not complete. For exammple, figure 1.1 on page 8 is missing the connection lines. Figure 1.2 on page 9 is also missing elements; the words are there, but the circles, lines, etc. are missing. It goes on throughout the book in this way. First, I think this is strange and should have been caught by the publisher. Second, I bought this book in 2008 and no one has ever mentioned it on Amazon. I'm sure others have actually read it, but why has no one else commented?!?Good book; bad publisher - Aldine Transaction Publishers"
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE, IT'S SUCH A CLASSIC. AND IT HELPED ME TO LEARN ABOUT THE LIFE OF THE LEGENDARY JOSEPHINE BAKER. I LOVE THE STORY BEHIND THE MUSIC."
3,More to her story but good,"I am surprised by the life this black dancer/singer lived. She had married white men, lived in France and was quite outspoken. I hope Ms. Whitfield is proud of this performance. We tend to forget about the many black artists we have to be proud of, especially when we think of the life they lived back then. Not many people know about Josephine Baker, we can be proud of this entertainer. Check out her story."
3,For ESL not foreign language classes,"This book has 128 pages plus a few in the back for notes. There are 7 chapters, Icebreakers, Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing, Vocabulary, and Structure. It is designed for ESL, not ESL and foreign language. There are a few activities that could be used for foreign languages (which is why I bought it.) Most of the activities are designed for adults, not middle school or high school students. I saw only two 2 overlapping activites with the Zero Prep for Beginners book."
5,Excellent Product and Service,"I am so happy with the product and delivery time Amazon Rocks, this was my first time ordering something with such great results, I will definitely purchase again through Amazon Thank you"
1,For OLD PEOPLE,i mean...it smells good if your 45. If your 23 and trying to get laid its not gonna stand out. not a fan if this at all....
5,Love this smell,This cologne will have you smelling like a million dollar man. My wife loves it and I bought my dad a bottle also.
2,Not bad if you are an older guy,This sent is for an older guy like 40 years and older. A co-worker said it reminded her of scent that her older brother in law would wear.
3,"Good, but not quite there","I picked up a bottle of this recently at a local department store having a huge sale (about same price as Amazon, but without the shipping). I've found it quite pleasant, except for a lingering (and very subtle) baby-powderish scent behind the more forward notes, although the scent deepens throughout the day. I would say if I had to choose between this and the tried and true Cool Water by Davidoff, I would go with the latter. For preference context, my favorite colognes are Black by Kenneth Cole, Hei by Alfred Sung, Guess for Men, and Vetyver by L'Occitane. As one of the negative reviewers mentioned, I would have to agree that Perry Ellis 360 is more for the ""suits and ties"" professional crowd than the teens and early 20-somethings in casual apparel, but it's certainly not an ""old person's"" scent. I'm 30 and it seems to fit just right."
3,Beatitude is exceptionally Beautiful,"'Beatitude' is similar to other exceptionally good electronica albums, eg, 'Fantasma' by Cornelius, 'The Contino Sessions' by Death In Vegas. Basically upping the ante by upping the range of the number of influences which can be squeezed into one CD, eg, funk, rock, 60's music, ambient, jazz, turntablism, folk, etc, all glued together with underlying beats. There's no denying it's diversity and mood shifts, which in fact, is Beatitude's overall strength. One of my favorite albums of 2003."
2,"Variety is the spice of life, but too much is inedible","This album has some great moments (""Salami Fever""), but ultimately is all over the place. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy very diverse music, but this is so eclectic it becomes impossible to take in as a single piece of work."
3,What Happened?,"Wow. Not Pepe Deluxe we all loved from the first album.... This one is not so good. Vocals on some tracks, less brass, and more rock."
4,Pepe Deluxe's latest,"I've listened to the reverse evolution of Pepe Deluxe, from this year's Queen of the Wave, back to 2004's Beatitude. Beatitude has all the textures, the studio mastery, sampling and scratching, all the contrasts, from metal-disco pop-fusion to touchingly slow ballads...they've still got it, now in 2004, just as they did in their fantastic debut of 2012."
1,poor service,"You sent me a product that was not authentic, but had been used. It was not properly sealed as a brand new authentic CD should have been. When I downloaded on my computer, instead of the author and the names of the songs, I got unknown in my media windows player. I was very disappointed and will not use the service again."
1,"interesting idea, poorly executed","This novel starts with an interesting idea, but it's written poorly and in need of some heavy duty editing. The author's tortured prose is so dense with unnecessary words, bizarre adverbs, and awkward phrases I wasn't sure if I should laugh or quit reading. From page 132: `Then she realized that he was looking at her body whose intricate details were exposed through the clinging dress.' Um, what? There are many other ridiculous sentences you too can enjoy if you manage to plow through to the end. In 600 plus pages, the author must have used the word `upon' 1200 times, seemingly convinced that if on were the right word, upon would be even better. There are endless examples: `She tossed the book upon the bed,' `He lay upon her body,' `They stepped upon the train.' The author also uses adverbs bizarrely. `He slowly walked upon the slowly darkening streets.' `She glanced shyly away after looking shyly into his eyes.' Good grief!"
1,Spoiler Alert,If I could give this book negative stars I would. I hated the main character. She seemed like Irish Ghetto and I was hoping she would be killed off before she birthed that little demon seed at the end
2,This published by Penguin?,"I bought this book at the airport on the strength of the endorsements but mostly because it was published by Penguin Books. The premise is intriguing but character development is poor, the descriptions and dialogues are full of clichés, without a memorable sentence in the entire book. Quietus is also full of historical and geographical errors. Eliminating unnecessary adjectives and adverbs alone would have reduced the page count by a third... and another third should have been chopped by a good editor. The author may write screenplays, but she's not a novelist. What is happening at Penguin?"
2,BLAH,"I bought this book because the cover compared it to Anne Rice. It was neither suspensful nor a thriller. I must admit it was interesting at first, but then it just became depressing and boring. The main charachter is doomed from the start, but she takes time out to have sex with the grim reaper? That was gross and had nothing to do with the plot. A few chapters try to compare the Bible to the Book of the dead. Interesting, but BORING!"
2,Historically Extremely Sloppy,"When I got to the point with the death penalty in Massachusetts, I gave up. If the author is this inaccurate with such a fundamental thing as this, she must be as sloppy throughout the rest of the book. Having the death penalty in Massachusetts, even in fiction, goes against who we are and what we stand for. She's obviously from out of state, which I realized when I read about 'Boston license plates.' Now, what's a Boston license plate? Like the Boston Globe, I'd give it a 'don't bother.'"
5,HAUNTING!,"I finished this book days ago, but I still can't get it out of my head. Once I got sucked in, the story consumed me. It will leave you thinking while scaring the heck out of you in the process. It delves into a woman's near-death experience. Only the experience is not your typical floating toward the light one. It's disturbing and harrowing. Quietus is one of the best thrillers I've ever read, but be forewarned. It will keep you up at night frightened of the shadows!"
5,Loved it!,"I could not put this book down, and I cannot stop thinking about it, and the characters, since I have finished it. I thought it was a wonderfully written book, exprssive, complete, and I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a suspenseful, gothic like, ghost story, with characters I fell in love with, and some that really scared me! It wasn't exactly new territory, the premise of the book, but it didn't matter, I was so caught up in it, I had to sit and read it until I was done. I look forward to more work from Ms. Schilling, as a matter of fact, I just ordered her previous book from Amazon. Can't wait until it comes!"
1,I just don't understand,"I just finished reading Quietus and was so unhappy with it I logged on to find out what others had to say. I was very surprised to find many good reviews. I think the author writes well but could use a good editor to help move the plot along. Speaking of plot, none of the story lines was completed. Death was the answer to every question posed. What was the author trying to say? I kept reading the book because I longed for some twist which would give hope to the characters, there was none. What you read at the beginning, that death was stalking them all, was all you got. Am very sorry to have wasted my time."
3,Readable but weak story,"It took me weeks to read this book, and not because I read slowly. The story while having a readable cadence lacked a coherent story line that dropped lines of thought clumsily and characters' lacked realistic depth and motivation. While the author bravely attempts an interesting concept of fate collecting its' due, it never makes clear on how ""God"" makes mistakes, and then clumsily and violently rectifies the situation.2.5*"
1,600 Plus pages for that? Spoiler Alert,"I picked this book up off the breakroom table after finishing a book in the morning...big mistake. The plot is simply this in a nutshell...If you should have died but didn't, you will die soon. Five people survived a plane crash and 600 pages later they die. That's it. I felt that the story lacked substance, direction, and meaning. I suffered through the book believing that it had to get better, but was disappointed in the end. I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to anyone. If you happen to see this book on your break room table, do everyone a favor an toss it in the trash..."
3,Enjoyable But Long-Winded,"I love the story this novel tells, but Vivian Schilling took far too long to tell it! There are so many delicious twists and turns in this book, but far far far too much unnecessary detail that make it hard to continue reading. I love to read, but I found myself skipping paragraphs, because Schilling continued on for pages about the same point. Something she could have boiled down to a more concise paragraph or two.Other than the wordiness of the novel, I must say the story is intriguing. Truly an enjoyable piece of work. I'd like to make an attempt at more of Schilling's work."
3,much too long,"The story drags horribly. Should have been half as long. Author can't keep her facts about historical religion straight, even misspelling the names of Bible books. It is agreeably spooky, and begins well, but I think she fell in love with the atmosphere and couldn't bear to stop writing."
1,"great cover, disappointing book","This book was a real letdown. I bought it because of the enticing jacket copy and the comparison to Anne Rice, but I wish I'd saved my money. The characters are flat, predictable stereotypes, and the plot is a jumbled mess, combining several strains of myth and religion into an unsavory stew. Worse still, it's full to the brim with typos, misspellings, bad grammar, and malapropisms that a 6th grader would notice. It will probably get made into a movie, hopefully with a better script. I'd wait for that."
2,Yawn ...,"Skip reading this book and rent the ""Final Destination"" movies instead. Sure, they're cheesy teen flicks, but a lot less boring. I'd had my eye on ""Quietus"" for a couple of years and finally picked it up just after Christmas. I'm still trying to get through it so I can move on to something more interesting, like a Preston/Child collaboration. The premise seemed quite promising, but just hasn't delivered. The prose is annoying at best. As another reveiwer pointed out, ""for"" is just about the only conjunction used when a nice ""since"" or ""because"" would suffice. I think the reader is supposed to be captivated with the main character, Kylie, but she and her loser husband just come off as cliche soap opera characters. Her friend, Amelia, is a drippy nonentity at best.""Quietus"" is not a complete wash ... readers who enjoy pulp romance would probably consider this book a step up from the usual fluff. If, however, you like sharp, intelligent, edge-of-your-seat suspense, this book is not for you."
1,Good story idea but.......???,"The author had a good idea for a novel but it lacked any real suspense as you always knew where it was going, and the writing was horrendous.My major problem was the actual prose. The author's writing style was horrible. I had trouble getting into the story as her style was so amateurish I felt like I was reading a vanity publication!!!Does the publishing houses actually edit anything anymore???"
2,Drawn out mess,"It took me along time to finish this book. I found everything overly descriptive with too much attention spent on every detail of every room, and not enough time spent on the story.Too many times I found myself reading pages upon pages of insignificant events. I didn't care about dreams of spiders crawling across the ceiling. These overdone details detracted from my level of character involvement.Without going into any details, parts of the story are extremely memorable such as; The Crash, the school, the subway, the fire, the church.The story itself was entertaining, however the read was long and painful. The story could have been told in half as many words."
4,finally! something well written,I liked this book. it is well written and kept my attention - which is something in itself. nice story line with zigs and zags that are unexpected.also cool... i was suprised to see it twice in children of men. the main character has it on his table.
4,Quietus- A Novel of Suspense (Seriously),"All I have to say is, Wow. This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire way through. Although it may seem a bit lengthy, it is definitely worth the time. Schilling has outdone herself with this novel.This book was so descriptive that I had perfect images of the raven with human eyes staring at me. I would get the chills anytime the ""death angels"" were mentioned in this novel.This book really makes you appreciate what you have in your life. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if they are looking for a good scare."
2,Where have all the copyeditors gone?,"I'm four pages into the novel, and already gnashing my teeth in frustration at the TRULY AWFUL copyediting. Neither author nor copyeditor seems to have even a rudimentary grasp of English grammar or word usage.I'm gonna keep trying to finish it, because the story sounds interesting, but it's setting my teeth on edge."
2,Editing is atrocious,"I am on page 381 of this tomb. Every other page has been a journey through the seventh circle of grammatical hell. Someone at Penguin really dropped the ball on this one. However, I am determined to muscle my way through. If you can ignore the editing problems, fill in the holes, and keep the concept at the forefront of your mind, you may find some redeeming qualities in the tale. In fact, if you just keep a pencil handy and edit for yourself, you may very well uncover the diamond in this (apparantly) rough draft.The most positive bit I can say for this so far is that there is definte atmosphere. Schilling doesn't quite capture this as, say, Iris Murdoch, but you understand what Schilling is attempting to accomplish, and if you permit yourself to let go of your technical snobbery, you will be drawn into the attempt."
1,WHAT A MESS,"Too bad you can't give negative stars!Sorry to admit, I spent days reading this horrendous excuse for a novel. As in earlier reviews, I'm bewildered at the total absence of editing. Have the major publishers eliminated that job?The plot (and I use the term loosely) meandered in every conceivable direction. Notwithstanding the full-page bibliography, was there any purposeful research done prior to writing this book? The author left at least one major character hanging, never to mention them again.There are any number of better ways to spend your money and your leisure time."
5,Black Sabbath - 'Black Sabbath / Vol. 4' (Maximum),"Band's astounding, trend-setting and (of course) ground-breaking (in every sense of the word) self-titled debut record ('70) brings to mind such timeless heavy metal trinkets like the band's eerie namesake ""Black Sabbath"", ""The Wizard"", the stoner anthem (?) ""Wall Of Sleep / N.I.B."" and ""Sleeping Village"". I ask you - does it much better than this? Then, I was pretty stoked to hear an lp I haven't heard in ages - 'Vol. 4', Sabbath fourth effort - loved checking out the eight-minute ""Wheels Of Confusion"", ""Tomorrow's Dream"", the piano ballad (you read that correct) ""Changes"", ""Supernaut"" (also loved when Ministry covered this track) and ""Laguna Sunrise"". I really like this CD - can you tell? To put in plain English, an absolute must-have."
4,An abstract state of timelessless,"""Future Lounge"" has recaptured the essence of Al Gromer Khan's gentle meditational drift for me. Overall less industrial than ""Lexus"", his most recent work has some wonderful sitah and meditational composition (particularly track 3 onwards). But the album also has tracks with some beat and a hint of his former work (particularly ""Lexus"").However, maybe not the taste for all, as this is quite different to the popular ""Space Hotel"" or his more sitah based music. However, in keeping with Al Gromer Khan's creation of ""Paisley Music"", this work has that open, abstract state of timelessless. In this sense the artist presents an esoteric listening lounge for the future."
3,Mayflower to the Moon,This is basically a history of the author's ancestors and family. I share some of them but most of them I do not share. Therefore the book is of marginal interest to me. If you share a lot of the author's ancestors and family i think you would find it very interesting.
4,It should really be called Irish Language Voices...,"...or at least Gaelic voices, because only songs in the Irish language are featured here. There are none from the other two Gaelic tongues, Scots Gaelic and Manx, and none from the other Celtic languages, Welsh, Breton, or Cornish. But no matter, this album provides a fine sampling of Irish-language songs, and a variety of ways of presenting them. In my opinion, the best tracks are those by Aoife Ni Fhearraigh, Noirin Ni Riain, and Padraigin Ni Uallachain. These three ladies definitely have the best voices on the album, and all three have different styles of presentiong the songs. Ni Fhearraigh's songs are produced in a more modern fashion. Ni Uallachain sings with traditional instruments backing her. Ni Riain's tracks, from her album, The Virgin's Lament, are the most powerful. She sings in the Sean Nos style, without accompanyment, and the songs are breathtaking. This is a good primer for those who enjoy Irish-language singing."
3,joy for christmas day,"In no way does this compare to kathy's 1st christmas album, but is still kathy and good in ot's own right. (only my opinion)"
3,Joy for Christmas Day Kathy Mattea,"Kind of different, but still good.Music was different and I don't think typical Kathy Mattea. But it was still good."
3,Not the best in production quality,"I bought this CD because I'm a big fan of Betty Grable. Many of her films are not available on VHS let alone DVD. So I bought this CD to jump at the chance of finding some of the music from her films. Unfortunately, the production value of this CD is rather poor. It was obviously recorded or transfered from a record - a record with a skip in it that shows up in the song ""Tra La La"". As for the Judy Garland portion, there's a few songs that sound like Judy is singing in a cave. This CD makes a good ""place holder"" until one of better production quality comes along."
1,Doesn't work at all,I installed this device on my XP PC but my effort has been unlucky. I used some tips from past reviewers like uninstall it and try again but it doesn't work at all. I also downloaded the drivers from the q-stor site but they are the same that comes with the cd.I think this item was a waste of money.
4,"It works fine, but doesn't install automaticaly","I got this as a last ditch effort before shelling out $50 for the one that went with my watch. I followed the installation instructions, and as the others have said, it didn't work, and I had two useless applications installed.I went into the device manager, found the IRDa device, and updated the driver and it has worked fine since."
1,WAC-WOM! (What A Complete-Waste Of Money!),I bought this IrDA Adapter for my Polar S625X HRM Watch.I was unable to get this (the Q-STOR IrDA Adapter) oranother IrDA Adapterto work on Windows XP.---I did manage to find one that actually worked - the Cables Unlimited IrDA Adapter. It works flawlessly in helping to transfer the data from my Polar watch to my PC. I'd recommend this one instead.
1,Terrible!,"I'll sum it up quickly. Terrible software. Huge waste of time to get it working, although it did finally work. Then the case fell apart within one month requiring glue and tape, which held another month. Then replacement with a quality product. Steer clear!"
5,The whole story,"Covering the history of cattle ranching from before Columbus to the present day; it allows you to see how each step of the process evolved from the situation before. Discusses the contributions from the Spanish and English emigrants, and the African slaves. Reviews which breeds were used where,how they did, and why. The economics of success and failure of the different regions. Clear and easy reading for those with only a passive interest and enough tables and references and footnotes for a college paper."
3,Beatiful pictures but short on practical advice,"The pictures are beautiful, making this a great 'coffee table' book. But the practical advice on how to care for Hydrangeas is skimpy."
4,Poetic,"If you are looking for real practical advice better buy Glyn Church books or the Gardener's guide. For real deep insight Michael Dirr's book is invaluable. But this book, which is rather useless as a practical guide, has the power of really showing the beauty and poesy of the flowers. The photographs are outstanding and really inspiring, and I think it could be appreciated by beginners and experts alike."
1,Don't,It's not worth the money. The plants are not correctly identified by botanical name and the information is unreliable. Buy Dr. Dirr's book.
4,A great album,"A great sophomore album from a group who has gone their separate ways.I really enjoyed listening to this album. It has a nice mix of ballads and up-tempo songs. The lads really did a nice job, especially with the cover of TAKE ON ME."
5,Wonderful music,I own this CD and bought this copy for a friend for Christmas because I am so in love with the music. My friend was thrilled with the quality of the CD.
2,"Weak scholarship, but a few good points","If you're looking for a book to validate your prejudices and fears about life in the information age, this is it. If you want clear, unbiased analysis with conclusions drawn from the evidence gathered (as opposed to ""evidence"" gathered to support what the author assumes is true), keep looking. An honest introduction to the book would have included something like: ""The evidence doesn't support much of what I'm saying, but some educated people agree with me, so I'm going to suggest the evidence is there after all."" If you're patient enough to wade through a mountain of weak scholarship and undisguised crisis mongering, there are still some solid points to be gleaned, but a magazine article would have been sufficient to convey the really good stuff."
1,Pure bunk! Pseudo-science. Embarrassing. Destructive,"As if U.S. schools were not saturated with enough child-damaging fads (whole language, constructivism, discovery learning, developmentally appropriate practices), Healy comes along and tries to provide a ""scientific"" foundation for this destructive twaddle by deriving instructional practices from brain research that is considered questionable by the brain researchers themselves. It's this sort of bunk that really endangers our children's minds. Only morons (i.e., knee-jerk ""progressives"" and education ""deformers"") will go for this clap-trap: because they don't read anything serious and couldn't understand it if they did."
5,Great video!,"My 4 year old son LOVES this video! We had tried the Teach to Talk video series by Jenny McCarthy and my son never really took to them. But, he is loving this one. He wants to watch it all the time and we sing along to the cd that is included when we're driving in the car.The best thing is he is starting to apply their message of what to do when you get frustrated. We've tried for a year to get him to take deep breaths and count to 10, but to no avail. Now, after 3-4 viewings, he is starting to do it on his own. Major breakthrough!If your child learns from video modeling, as mine does, this is a great purchase."
5,Great characterization and dialogue,"Minister Faust must have learned how to do great characterizations from reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes Stories, because his characterizations of all of his characters in this novel are just amazing. In fact, at one point in the dialogue, one of his characters does make reference to Sherlock. With his character charts introducing each new character, Minister Faust takes characterization to a new level. But he doesn't use these charts as a crutch. His characters come to brilliant life as they speak, act and think. Anyone who is at all familiar with great literature or even great movies will also love his clever hidden references to and occasional parodies of icons of popular culture."
5,All hail the Coyote Kings!,"What caught me first was the title. Inside it's still caught me. The SF references and the use of D&D-style character sheets to introduce/highlight the characters so totally is amazing/amuzing. Some of the SF & Gaming references are gonna be unfamiliar to the Mundanes. Not since Niven/Pournelle/Flynn's _Fallen Angels_ have I read a book that casts the SF/Gaming geeks as *heroes*! I would have read this book faster (it's a real page-turner) if it wasn't for the fact that I have 2 small children (4 & 15mos as of the writing of this review) who occupy most of my time. Minister Faust left us a little hanging at the end with a few untied ends.....but that's fine. Perhaps we'll see another one of the adventures of Hamza & Ye, the Coyote Kings in the near future"
3,Got half way through it...,"I bought this book because a friend recommended it to me. The premise seemed interesting enough to read during the commute. The beginning was good, but just as I started to get to the middle, it occurred to me that the author is clearly writing himself into this book. The human the devil possesses for the purpose of this story has a name that clearly resembles the authors. Also, the character of the Devil is clearly what he wants or wanted to be, a confident, successfully romantic character. If I want to read books where authors hide themselves in books, I'd get the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, which I also couldn't read for the same reason, so I guess I don't want that....stuff....Anyway, I could see how some people might like it but it's just not my cup of tea."
2,I wanted to like it.....,"I guess I just got spoiled by Neil Gaiman in his graphic novel series ""Lucifer"" where Ol' Scratch was refined and had his own sense of morals, and was, in general, somewhat admirable in his own way. Glen's take on Lucifer turned him into a being that was a cross between a bratty 16 year old and a narcissistic middle-aged devorcee. He was just pittiful. There was absolutely nothing admirable about this character; he wasn't even that intelligent! Sorry, I was just terribly disappointed in this book and was expecting more after reading The Last Werewolf and Tahlula Rising, also by Duncan."
2,Just Couldn't Get Into It,"I have a rule: If I read 50 pages of a book and can't get into it, I don't finish it.I didn't finish ""I, Lucifer"". It's not that the content bothered me or that it is poorly written. It felt like I was trying to follow the thought pattern of an ADHD coke head, which is perfect for Lucifer. The author did a beautiful job of stepping into Satan's head, but I found it blasted impossible to read. Like trying to slog through quicksand in Hell. There are others who loved this book, and you might too, but I didn't find the story engaging enough to fight through the author's clouded prose.""A"" for effort, ""B"" for story, ""F"" for readability."
3,"I, Lucifer... started strong finished not so strong","What started as a great read slowly dwindled into a chore as the main plot was watered down by one near schizophrenic segway after another and the ending seemed almost like an afterthought that left a lot to be desired. Characters were fairly underdeveloped and the various story arcs within this piece were dropped and scattered all over the place. To echo another reviewer, ""Satan's explanations turns more and more into whining and ranting about what a bad lot he had being one of God's angels""."
3,Interesting...,"I enjoyed this book, but the main character was a little too simple for my tastes. supposedly the incarnation of evil spends his time on earth writtingg his meoirs and a screenplay? i wolud give Lucifer more credit than that. still, the book has many interesting ideas on good, evil and the role of God and the devil in our lives. there is also the added layer of the fact that the narrator lies to us blatantly on several occasions. just what else written is a lie?the helter skelter stream of conciousness that is Lucifer's mind is also difficyult to read at times. sometimes i think i understood what was being said. others i know i missed the point completely. still, i did have fun reading this book. however i expected more."
1,"Nice cover art, but not worth the read.","The cover art caught my attention as I scanned the book shelves. But only a few pages in, I realized I had been duped. The story offers nothing new or interesting. The humor can barely be considered humor. Half way through the book I was ready to put it down or attempt to get a refund. The story is all over the place, which would not be a problem if any of the story lines were interesting. I was glad to finish the book so I could move onto something more interesting. Please save your time and money and buy anything else."
1,"Good Concept, Convoluded writing","A good concept. Walking through the book store I saw the same old story. This book grabbed my eye as possibly something different.Unfortunately, the concept was undermined by writing that resembled a deposition. Perhaps the book is written well for a drugged out, middle aged Satan, but I found it difficult to follow. The narative was more of an inside joke for the writer than an explanation or good storytelling."
1,Do not recommend this book.,"When I read the concept of this book I was very interested in it. I purchased it through another website as it was cheaper and I am thankful for that because it's not even worth what I paid.I thought the story was going to be about Lucifer taking over a recent sucide's body for a month to try to get back into Heaven. Little did I know that very little was actually about that. In a previous review for another book I read by Glen Duncan I had stated that he has story telling ADD. He can't stick to the story to save his life, but rather jumps around all over the place. This book was very hard to follow and most of it was about previous things Lucifer had done. Not about the current matter at hand, that he was living a human life for a month.I would never recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Wanted to enjoy, but didn't.","Glenn Duncan's novel centers on a deal FOR the devil. The dark lord gets to inhabit the body of a recent suicide, a failing author by the name of Declan Gunn. By living in this body for thirty days Lucifer gets to try to earn his way back into heaven. What follows is Lucifer going on sensory overload. He goes on a 30 day escapade into drugs, male and female hookers, and long booo-ring tirades. Lucifer embraces the bohemian lifestyle which just bores me to death. Maybe I was spoiled by reading the Sandman Slim series and that version of Lucifer seemed to jibe with what I thought a fallen angel would be. I knew that this was not an action epic, but it could have been a lot better. This book just happens to drag on for me. I got a little better towards the end, but too little too late. Others may enjoy this, but unfortunately it is not for me."
1,Way too much work to read,"You know how people just try way too hard sometimes? That was the feeling I got when I read this book. Duncan used 27 words when he could have used 3. Next time, just use the 3 words and save us 200 pages."
3,Not quite what was expected,"Looking at the picture you would think that the roller set would be part of the system. You would also think that this cover covered the whole system... Well when I got it I found out that this is simply a cover that goes over the top, it is open at the bottom. In addition, the roller system is not included. I do think they should have been more upfront with that. The cover itself is nice, just not all I expected. That's probably why it is so cheap."
1,"Poor product, even worse customer service","Bought this. Received it three weeks late. Product did not deliver as promised. Returned it with a return authorization number. Made several long-distance phone callsm to verify that package had been received and refund was being processed. EIGHT MONTHS LATER AND CUSTOMER SERVICE STILL HAS NOT PROCESSED MY REFUND!!! Do not waste your money on this product, especially since refunds are apparently nonexistent."
4,Terrific merengue Pena Suazo style!,"I stumbled across this album a few years ago not really intending to buy anything but could not resist purchasing it. Even without hearing it I had faith in Banda Gorda's previous albums which are quite good. This one is no exception to the rule, it has a good mix of merengue styles; fast, mambo, up beat it should meet the needs of all. The most sentimental and catchy song on the album is Aqui, pero alla. It perfectly explains the sentiment of Dominicans who left their land for better but their hearts are still in their country. Very touching, that song alone makes the album worthwhile. There's a nice cumbia as well- Besos-, a first for Banda Gorda. If you like this style of merengue-mambo, this album is a must!"
3,Good read,This book was a fats read ans brought up some really interesting ideas. Extremely happy with this purchase. Came in perfect condition.
3,good Book,but its too must useless theory that no one knows how to apply in the practical world if you are a designer its not going give your work that mysterious magic that the title promise; disappointed.
3,Most of it excellent,"It is dissapointing that some of the songs aren't the real ones, but the rest of them are worth listening to."
4,Very Neat CD,If you like the WWF than you should get this cd it is very cool. It has15 songs and most of them (to me) are very good. But I still like Vol. 3 better because it has my favorite Wrilster KANE! This is a very good CD.
4,My Music Review,"I'm a big-time WWF fan. The WWF always produces some great entrance themes. I have volume 2. The album is fun to listen to. Songs like ""Mankind"" and ""Sycho Sid"" was a disapointment. They should have done with out the words. I didn't like Shawn Michaels new version of ""Sexy Boy"". That really stunk. They should have put the original version in. So, that is why I didn't give a total of 5 stars. But, you should buy this CD if you are a WWF fan. I can't wait to buy volume 3! Thank You!!!"
3,"Don't bother with this cd, take volume 3!",This cd was made in 97' and you'll be hard pressed to find any recent theme songs. if you want a wwf cd I definitly reccomend a later volume that was made in the current year.
2,Volume 1 was much better,"What ever happened to wrestlers who wrestle. Now we got these glorified stunt men making music. This is definatley a sign of the fall of western civilization. I'll admit, i watch wrestling, but I have no desire to play the theme music of these mucsle boud stunt men in my home when I am not watching the program. I see wrestling as an entertainment experience every monday night, not as a get in my car and pump a little Stone Cold Steve Austion, I hope that nobody is like that, because that would be really sad and disturbing. Pleae,if you are a WWF fan, save your money, enjoy these guys taking falls and insulting each other, because that is there purpose. You got to understand, these guys aren't musicians, they are so as much as you are. Please use the brain that god gave you."
3,What is the deal.,"Why don't the WWF ""people"" sit down and make an album of just entrance themes. W2 is okay but Undertaker's, and Mankind's themes have words to them. Why don't they make one without the words, or any other music that doesn't pretain to WWF."
3,Unbeliveable CD on some songs,Some of the songs are very good but others were not as good because they talk over it like the undertakers. and Bret Hart's because there are words to it. Shawn Michaels's song isn't as good because someone else is singing it.
2,Get Volume 3!,"I'll always remember how disappointed I was when I skipped to Austin's theme, and instead of hearing the song I'd heard on TV, I heard Austin talking, and the song itself then began halfway into the true version. Most of the remixes on this album (Austin, Mankind, Sid, HBK, etc.) are terrible. What saves it from being a total waste are Vader, Ahmed Johnson, Sunny, and Flash Funk, which are themes you won't find anywhere anymore. Save your money and buy Volume 3."
5,it's the best wrestling CD out there!!!!!,"This is the best WWF CD, it has all the classic entrance music and some of the new one's. It has every thing from Stone Cold to Shawn Michaels, everything from the Undertaker to D-Generation X. I highly recommend it. Peace!"
3,Quite Good but not Great!,This CD is okay if you really want it bad but if you wanna listen to some good themes you should buy Volume 3.Volume 3 has better themes and not much yakin'.Austin's theme is better in V.3 than V.2.Undertaker's is okay but not great.It's a half a$$ thing on this one.
4,definitive review of a classic topic in psychology,"How are attitudes formed? How do they shape behavior? This edited volume gathers together many (if not most) of the best researchers of attitudes in one volume, all addressing the old but recently revived concept of attitude strength. When someone expresses an attitude forcefully (e.g., I HATE the New York Yankees), what does this imply for the underlying strength, stability, and most of all behavioral predictability of that attitude? While dry at times, many of the chapters are enjoyable, and the volume as a whole is essential reading for anyone interested in how attitudes shape the social world."
3,hypothyrodism living well with this,I think this book is a must have for those who are faced with this in their life. A very interesting book.
2,Not a very useful book,"This book is not very useful. It has too much ancillary information while leaving out the primary information. You will get more confused after reading it. It seems the author has just collected any bit of information on thyroid without much study of why and how the information is relevant and thrown into this book. The causality is seriously missing from this book. After reading this book, one comes from the impression that everything is caused by thyroid and everything damages the thyroid. Bunk!Save your money and by another book on the subject."
2,Alot of words,"I found this book to have alot of words to read, however not alot of information that I didn't already aquire through the net and my nurse-practitioner. I wish I could say the opposite."
5,Excellent book,"Unquestionably, the first book you should read on hypothyroidism. Well written, very inclusive, and easy to follow. The author is an excellent advocate for patient rights."
4,so much!,"This book covers many aspects. It has many helpful hints, but also areas that yu may want to do your own research. IT has openned my eyes to many symptoms and also ways to make you feel better"
5,Great writing and serious info...get it,"Dealing with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome for 20 years, I was both elated and angered to discover the source of the problem was hypothyroidism and adrenal exhaustion. I have a great doctor who is willing to work with me on this, as it is not ""textbook"" medicine.Every person is different and the concept of the ART of medicine,treating the person rather employing a ""math problem"" approach to make the numbers right on paper, must have been lost must have been lost on the majority of physicians.Ms. Shomon is a professional writer and this is not only informative but a ""good read."" If you feel awful and don't know why, get this book. I have a dozen or so books on this topic, and they are all good, but several stand-out as ""best."" This is one of the best."
5,Very Informative,"If you suspect that you have a thyroid condition, this book could be very beneficial to you. In my situation I was told twice that I didn't have a thyroid condition. After reading her book I had the courage and knowledge to seek out a doctor who would be willing to listen to me and diagnose me correctly. I have just ordered Living Well With Autoimmune Disorder by Ms. Shoman."
4,Agonizing symptoms,"Great book; great information. I am learning a lot about hypothyroidism. I have a ton of questions for my next doctor visit. Having Celiac Disease and then all of the following symptoms has made me feel nuts: hair loss, dry skin, insomnia, achy joints, sloooooow metabolism (next to non-existant), etc. I was aworried about fibromyalgia. I think once I can get my thyroid under control, I will be feeling much better. Fingers crossed."
5,Living Well with Hypothyroidism...,"This book contains a wealth of information. After reading only a couple of chapters, I have learned more about the disease than I have in the two years I've been under medical treatment. I especially appreciate the ""do's and don'ts"" that Ms. Shomon shares with her readers, as well as a listing of the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Definitely worthwhile reading!"
5,Must read!,"Whether you are newly diagnosed with hypothyroidism or you have had this condition for years - this book provides you with a complete understanding of the condition, suggestions for living with it on a daily basis. It is a must for every person with hypothyroidism."
2,Boring,This book had way too many quotes from other people. It seemed like 50% of the book was quotes. Maybe it was to validate what the author was saying..but enough is enough.........
5,Great book,"This is a book that every Hypothyroidism people should have. My suggestion is read this book first before you go to see a doctor. Knowledge you learn form this book will help you in many ways, and many years."
5,Urges one to take action vs. hyperthyroidism,"My wife has been treated for Grave's Disease and so this book has become very relevant. Although this book does not lack in its attention to scientific details, we like this one because its narrative style makes the content more personal. It relies on the everyday experience of hypothyroid patients, rather than just detailing the symptoms. Therefore it gives the reader more courage to take personal action. You can feel the concern the author holds for her readers, as she gives earnest, practical steps on how a patient can live normally despite the condition."
4,Great tips for the Hypothyroid!,"As a long-diagnosed hypothyroid patient, I was loking for a detailed explanation of the disease. Although the book was initially directed at those who may not have been diagnosed, it later turned to those who know what their problem is. The best part of this book was the one that urged readers to see a endocrinologist for a more deatiled examination. It worked great for me! The author also suggested that depression may result from hypothyroidism. Nobody ever told me that. My doctor followed the suggestions in the book and I was successfuly treated for depression. I never felt so good. A wonderful book, and certainly worth the price!"
5,An Amazing Read,"This book is an amazing read! I never knew so many things I've been diagnosed with can all be attributed to my low thyroid; sleep apnea, high cholestrol & even plantar faciitis. I'm so glad that I spent the money to buy this book; it's worth every penny."
2,Overly Exaggerated,"I've had an underactive thyroid since I was a teen. Always had trouble with weight, dry skin, hair. However, these problems are mostly hereditary in my family, with or without a thyroid problem. Her book is wordy and forgets to get to the point. She make hypothyroidism sound like a critical illness. Bet she could have put this book into a 30 page pamphlet. I kept falling asleep trying to read it."
4,Hypothyroidism,"A good book with a lot of information, but the author heavily pushes the drug Armour. NOT EVERYONE NEEDS ARMOUR!! Many do just as well, if not better on synthetics (eg: Synthroid)."
1,Don't Bother...,"I bought this book shortly after I learned I was hypo-thyroid. I had high expectations, because of hearing about Mary's books on her forums. I was severely disappointed. This book didn't tell me anything new...I had read the website,Stop The Thyroid Madness.... and that website had vast information vs. Mary's book. I also bought one of her e-books about Thyroid and Hair loss and was also disappointed. It didn't tell me anything new, at all. Her forum site has become a vehicle to sell her books, and not a open forum on thyroid health...New information is not allowed to be exchanged on the list if it pertains to other than Mary's books or websites....very Sad. I will look elsewhere for up-to-date relevant thyroid information.Stop the Thyroid Madness: A Patient Revolution Against Decades of Inferior Treatment"
2,Didn't fit my needs,It did not fit my health requirements. A friend suggested i get this book but it did not fit my needs.
4,Great info but I needed a magnifying glass,I'm not entirely done with the book but it is a great source of information. The only drawback is the print is sooo tiny that i actually am using a magnifying glass to read it.
4,Living Well with Hypothyroidism,"Thank you for this book. It arrived in a timely manor, in the condition quoted."
4,Comprehensive guide yet quick read,"I purchased this book for myself. I needed some answers and direction for Hypothyroidism that wasn't filled with long medical terms. This book, Living Well with Hypothyroidism: ""What Your Doctor Doesn't Tell You...What You Need To Know"" gives the reader solid answers, a guide to help the reader ask the doctor for help, and medical terms that are understandable for the layman."
5,great reading,"finally, I could get all the info in one place. Very useful for many of those who struggle with hypothyroidism and had many questions and little or no answers."
5,It's saving my life,This book gave me so much informtion that most of the medical profession appear to have no idea of. Having been hypothyroid for about 10 years (mostly undiagnozed) I would recommend the book to anyone who needs help in this area. The chapter that covered material on which drugs intereact with Synthroid was very illuminating.
2,Not that helpful,"I think everything I read in this book I've read online. And I really got tired of the doctor bashing and testimonies of others. Basically it tells you to be your own advocate at your doctor's office, ask questions until you understand the answers."
3,only good for display,"The toy is very good looking from distance but in closer look, it's cheaply made. it's a good item for display in an action figure collection but as a toy, it can't last even 24 hours in hands of a kid."
3,Not as good as i thought would be,"I brought this book for my reading while on the ""porcelain throne"" collection. I thought this book would be hilarious. In all actuality its kind of corny. It has 1 warning per page and just overall was a waste of my money. I mean some of them are funny. But out of 101, i skimmed through it in one sitting, laughing at probably 5 at most. I guess i expected too much from this book when i ordered it"
4,laugh city,"If you need a good laugh, this book is for you. great pick-me upper type book. Between the stories and odd tales once said, they still get told today."
3,"Short, Cute","This book offers a few laughs and memorable Warning Labels, but is too short to really be enjoyable. Some of the Labels are cute, and you can spend time wondering who actaully did some of the ridiculous stuff in there, but the book ends far too soon. You get about 30 good lables out of the 101, that's about it. I read through it in about 20 minutes, then gave it as a gift the next day."
2,"Get it from the library, if you must get it..","I borrowed this book from the library expecting a lot more. Too much more, maybe. It reads like one of those meditation-a-day style books with a meditation (dumb label) on each page and really isn't very funny. Sure, there were a few good cracks on really dumb labels, but for the mostpart I felt that the authors were far reaching into labels that had every right to be attached to the particular product. I found myself thinking.. ""What's wrong with that?"" and ""I understand why they have that label there"".Who knows.. maybe I've become immune to labels in a country where everyone is suing everyone else!"
3,Still country,"Milsap's 1975 release hints at his later country-pop excesses, but much of this is deft traditional country."
2,Not so pleased...,"I followed the directions and saw no results. (Other than making my tummy feel like it was going to explode after taking it -before & after- any cheat meal. You have to take at least 6 pills total to block the bad stuff, and I just never really saw any results."
1,Noticed nothing,"I don't really know what the result is supposed to be other than not gaining a million pounds for a piece of bread, but I don't think this does anything!! Wont order again"
2,Not nice to give a broken gift for a christmas gift,"His arm came broken. When my boyfriend opened it, his arm was cracked off."
5,totally cheesy karati movie,its hilarious and it has danny mc bride what else is there to say its freakin awesome and super cheesy and cheap just give it a buy wont be dissapointed
3,Nowhere near as good as Eastbound,"Saw this with great hope after watching Eastbound and Down, but no cigar. Not even close. Too rude and mean in ways that EAD wisely sidesteps. McBride's character gets too nasty at points and becomes far too unlikeable for us to care about him after a while.Plus there are long stretches without any real laughs, just major discomfort and squirmy moments. Those are nice as spice, but not as the main course.And McBride's huge debt to Ricky Gervais' David Brent is all too obvious (as is the director's). The (original and by far the best) Office did that, and much better. FFW gets a little too mean and unfunny at various times as well.I wouldn't recommend this. Just watch Eastbound again!"
3,Kenny Powers Lite,"You can easily see where Danny McBride started creating the Kenny Powers character. Fred Simmons is a little cleaner, little more subdued version of Powers. I had several laughs at this movie however unfortunately I would probably have enjoyed it more if I had seen it before East Bound and Down. I viewed it with a few friends and although we all loved it, the ones who hadn't seen East Bound seemed to like it more. One thing is clear; this group: McBride, Ben Best & Jody Hill are gonna be big stars."
2,Trailer is better than the movie,"From the way the trailer set it out, it seemed that this was going to be anAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (Unrated Widescreen Edition)-style send up of a martial arts school. This movie falls flat on its face, and honestly the trailer is better than the movie, and a better use of your time."
5,Rock star of the century award,"Justin and his band should get the rock star of the century award. Their driving melodies, emotional lyricism, honesty, and ridiculous amount of talent puts them at the top of my list. I listen to this CD all the time, and you should, too! Better yet, catch their live show. They're amazing."
3,Easy to use except.....,"I really thought this player was good, until I went to play the CD I had ""ripped"" from MP3 files. I had recorded this CD in the order I wished to hear my favorite songs. Much to my surprise, I had to listen to songs in order of the artist's name (alphabetically). There was not enough info w/ the Colby player to help me re-arrange my songs without spending another hour or so ""programing"" the player. I think from now on I will just stick w/ regular old pre-recorded CDs.I wanted this player to take all MY songs on a smaller amount of compact discs, but the inconvience of having to ""program"" after I had already recorded in MY order was rather frustrating.Otherwise it is, light and I do love the idea of being able to play MP3 files!!"
5,if you want a great kids book,"If your child is just learning to read and is reversing his/her letters don't worry, this little book encourages and explains letter reversal. The ""check it out"" message tells kids to look over their work and correct it. My child keeps it under her pillow at night and has brought it to her teacher who has read it to the class."
4,i was hopeing this adapter would fit,i was hopeing this would fit a nissan outboard motor but it does not so im still looking.if anyone knows who makes one let me know
1,Don't buy this product,"This product is no different from all the many scam products that exist on the market. Firstly, the smell is horrible, so unless you intend to hold your breath while making love, forget about it. Secondly, the only sensation my wife and I experienced was a burning one, thank God we did not use an entire package. And for those of you who don't like having your credit card debited without your permission, I strongly advise against doing any transactions on the Zestra.com website. Even if you choose the 'free' sample, you will still receive monthly shipments, at your own expense, without your approval. They simply send you an email notifying you that they just billed your credit card etc.The last bit made me certain that this product is nothing but another scam, running its course. So buyers beware.P.S. They only got one star because Amazon doesn't allow you to give less."
2,Nothing,I felt a slight sensation but nothing more. It didn't increase anything for me. If your looking for something that's going to help you have a O this isn't it.
5,Good and Fast,"This works very well and very fast with no side effects. It creates a very warm sensation that arouses both partners. It does have a slight herbal taste, but otherwise we are very pleased."
1,Doesn't work right away,"If it does work, It takes way too long to kick in apparently because there was no extra ""WOW"" at all. Sorry"
4,Shows subtle Japanese behavior,"Shosha Man shows the subtle ways the Japanese culture works. So much of the culture is reading between the lines, and this book really showsthe honne and tatemae (the inner and outer self) of the Japanese salaryman.It lets the reader feel the unsaid between boss, employee, coworkers, and lovers, and shows how the different status levels come into play. I recommend this book for anyone who knows some of Japanese culture and wants to explore deeper."
2,Full of jargon and repetitive.,"I was disapinted with this book. It is extremely general and theoretical, never specific. The author uses mostly complicated and technical terms when it is not needed. This book is also very repetitive, certain ideas are repeated over and over."
5,Love this bag!!!,"This bag is very good, I was looking for something small and not so bulky and this was perfect, its very compact yet it fits a lot inside, plus the two pockets on the side are insulated which is great for bottle transporting. This is perfect for going on short trips when you don't need to carry so many things, plus it fits very nicely on the stroller without looking awkward...I definitely recommend this item."
4,Lots of room in a small bag,"I originally bought the larger version of this bag. But as other reviewers noted, the bottle storage and compartments left very little room inside. It was a big bag with very little room. So I traded it for this bag. While it is compact in size, it is surprisely roomy. It perfectly holds several diapers and diapering accessories, a change of clothes, a light blanket, some toys and a couple of bottles (plus my wallet and cell phone). Perfect for an afternoon out. And it fits perfectly in the basket under the stroller. So this turned out to be a small bag with lots of room. However - you will probably need something bigger for a full day excursion. But for your everyday, few hour trips, this is the perfect size."
5,Love California Innovation Bags,"This is the my second style of this company. Great Price and Size. Not that I have my son is almost 3 it is the perfect size. I previously owned the large tote from the same company and loved that one as well. I clipped the cell phone and pacifier that came on that one onto this one. Now that I am having a second I am going to try out the backpack, which would make it my third bag just to have some versatility. I even can use this one a backpack if I lengthen the strap if I need to. Great bag if you have an older child or unlike me do not like to carry much when they are infants"
4,Great little diaper bag,"I bought this diaper bag after my showers, where I received a very nice but larger diaper bag. After using the larger one for a week, I knew I couldn't keep lugging that one around, so I ordered this one and am very happy with it. There are 2 places for bottles or water for me, a flap that holds just diapers, wipes, burp cloth and a pacifier leaving the large inner compartment free for a change of clothes and my wallet, cell phone, etc. The only thing about this bag is that is doesn't have a changing pad, although I suppose you could pack a small towel in the big compartment and be fine. Overall, highly recommended."
3,Great bag for small items,I like this bag and use it every day. It holds everything you need for a short trip. The only thing I do not like is that it doesn't come with a changing pad and it will not fit a lot of stuff when it comes time to switch from breastfeeding to food & bottles. It is a great first bag!
3,Good bag...Flap on top is bad,"As a couple other reviews have said, this bag has a lot of room and is great for mom and dad. BUT (and this is huge!) the flap going over the top makes quick access impossible (even if you leave the zipper under the flap undone). AND, the velcro holding the flap down tends to wake a sleeping baby. This bag would be much better with just the zipper on top. Also, it does not hold a padded travel changing pad. Overall, good bag though."
3,Too Small,"I can't use this bag because it doesn't fit all of the things I like to bring with me. It holds a few necessities, but forget about toys and extra bottles. It does look nice, not like a typical diaper bag."
2,Needs redesigning,"Someone said they were going to cut the front flap off this bag and although that sounded strange I did just that too! The flap front is more of a nuisance than benefit and really adds bulk to the appearance of this bag. Once I cut the flap off I could actually use the bag and get faster access. Another downside is that its main compartment tends to be a ""black hole"" swallowing up everything and making things invisible. A contrasting lining color would solve that problem. The zippers are hard to pull. On the plus side, it is fairly roomy and quite a bit larger all over than the name suggests. This is not a mini bag. The strap is long enough to wear the bag diagonally across your chest and make it hands free. The side pockets are difficult to reach into and a sippy cup really needs shoving to get it in. For the cost this bag is ok but could definitely be improved upon."
3,good bag but....,I bought this bag recently but once I got it home I changed my mind. The baby's stuff fits into it nicely as well as my wallet & cell phone but there were 2 things I didn't like about the bag: 1) the side pockets for bottles were very snug & hard to access since they're right below the straps & 2) overall the fabric was stiff. I wouldn't reccomend buying this bag.
4,awell ctually 41/2 stars...,"this bag is great. the size is perfect. I had planned on it being my backup but find i use it as a primary now. i keep diapers,wipe case,a recv blanket an extra outfit- i find rolling items upto pack helps on space and a cup on eachside. the strap is very comfortable though the zipper tab tends to get hidden when pulled all the way over to side and ends up under strap.the only thing missing is a diaper changing pad. it looks like an infant can be placed on the front flap when opened up. but if your child is longer/older only their head, maybe back would fit on this. so i've imoprovised by keeping a rcvg blanket handy."
4,Denso replacement O2 sensor,"Not quite the match for the factory original,but seems to perform flawlessly.Also,assembled in the USA.The wiring harness was an exact match."
4,"Lightweight, sleek and feels good 'in-hand'.","I originally bought a set of four of these and really liked them. A reasonably inexpensive set (when I purchased, pricing is always subject to change...) and I like them WAY better than our supposedly higher quality ones that were a gift. They feel 'right' when in hand.The major 'drawback' is that you really do have to follow the manufacturer's recommendations about care. They are not a knife to just throw in the dishwasher and treat like normal flatware--they need to be dried or they will rust. I have to admit we did not care for them properly and when I went looking on the website I realized it was our own fault. The care is not arduous or anything, just boils down to recommending hand washing and drying thoroughly (at the very least dry properly). Not so different than any other knife like this!In any case, I liked them enough to buy more and purchased this 9 piece set. I'll just have to commit to caring for them the right way!Recommended!!JTG"
5,Chicago Cutlery Landmark Steak Knife Set,Purchased item as a shower gift. Saved $20 by buying here instead of same product at local Bed Bath and Beyond ($49.99). Free shipping and no sales tax either!
1,Rusted after one washing,After they were washed once they were put in the dish rack on top of one another.After about 6 hours I went to put them away and there was rust on the all handles. The blades did not show signs of rusting.
3,Not serrated edges.,"The knives were purchased to match a previous set of the same. I had 9, and I wanted 9 more. My previous set had serrated edges. This set had straight edges. They work fine, but were not what I expected."
2,disappointed,Awkward handles and lightweight feel. Bought as a gift and had to be returned. Chicago Cutlery has better lines.
3,Knives not a match,"I ordered this set a year ago & was surprised to find that these really don't match the first set. They are a bit shorter, which is not a problem. But they are now made with a hollow handle, which makes them feel flimsy & inadequate for cutting meat."
3,"OK , but language was a little dated at times","This was an ok book, certainly not the most exciting I've ever read but the plot moved along with kids on the lam from an unknown stalker after their mother died. It did seem easier for them to make money than I think real-world-on-the-lam kids would find it.However, the language seemed a little dated in parts. One person ""cracked wise"", which is not in current vernacular. At another point, the boy was worried about wearing short pants, as he felt he had outgrown them. I don't think present-day kids are concerned about wearing short pants, although kids from 1910 might have been. The book is not necessarily set in a particular time, but it seems contemporary except for occasional use of terms unlikely to be used by a contemporary kid."
4,Great Debut!!,This a Great Debut for Ms. Coleman!! A wonderful book -- one that is profoundly interesting and thought-provoking.Good Work!!-Rick Worthy
4,Trances Would Make a Great Movie!,"Cagnina's character insight is outstanding. We all know a Randy... a JW... a Talsa... and, Heaven help us, a Virgina... Cagnina has captured their personalities and eloquently woven them into literary art. The subplot satire of coporate America is both thought-provoking and humorous. I am looking forward to delving into his next published composition.Let's hope the next publication excludes typos, thus earning a full five stars from me...Cuddle up with this book!"
3,An excellent orientation to the practice of acudetox.,"This book is a must for acudetox students and practicioners. The history and background of acupuncture as a treatment for substance abuse is given in detail. How acudetox came into being and the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association. As a certified acudetox specialist, I found this book to be informative and useful and have let patients read from it as they are detoxifying."
4,Echo Five Papa,"I liked it, although it may be to graph for some. It was very hard hitting with many details. The Author tells his story in a no holds straight forward manner. Marines and militrary veterans will like it."
4,Must read,Author put you right beside him in Nam..Hard to put down. Action and drama is name of his real story.
5,"Read this book, it is the reality of a true warrior.","This book about grunts in Vietnam was a hard one to put down. Well written, lots of brave boys fighting for thier country and comrades in arms. As a Vietnam vetran, 1965-66, I highly recommend this book to any that are interested in the reality of war.Jeff Stewart"
5,Straight talk,Very very good Vietnam story from a simple soldier.Wished he had given the reader more details about his life after Vietnam.No fancy writing just a great read.
3,"I,TS COOL","A very rare cd the song it,s cool has not been released in years.I love the classic line ""you can,t leave me in the ocean and don,t expect the sharks to bite"".Another minor hit trustmaker released in 1974 was another song that got alot of air play.if you are a fan of the tymes this is for you.But if you are like me and just want to here a classic on cd buy it enjoy!"
4,Not live at all,This release contains well remastered studio cuts from the Tymes' successful 1970s stint at RCA. It contains all their hits of this part of their career (M/s Grace made No.1 over here in the UK) and is a worthy CD for lovers of 1970s soul/early disco. It's just a pity the group's Cameo Parkway material (like everything else from that label)has been unavailable for so long. That should be made available too.
5,tymes up/trustmaker,i bought this item from amazon after looking on the internet for months because their are songs on it that i couldn`t get any where else. thanks amazon
2,Biomertic mouse falls short with VISTA,"The mouse works fine with XP, after I upgraded to VISTA I had nothing but problems with it. APC does not seem to support this very well, and the drivers are old. I ended up tossing it out after a year, and just buying a regular lazer mouse."
2,"Big, Large,heavy Toy","This unit is Big, Large and heavy. It looks like it should have great sound but, it has very weak sound with very little base."
1,too big,"when it records from line-in it also records from the mike at the same time, which is not what i wanted, it didn't say it was a karaoke recorder, returned it and got most of my money back."
3,It's very large. . .,"But it works pretty good. You do have to put in the 10 D batteries even though it's plugged into an outlet to get the best sound. I'm not sure I'd recommend it if you had the resources to get something better. I didn't, but for what it cost, I'm not unhappy."
3,could of lasted longer..,"my husband bought this to take to work, three of the buttons already fell off, along with the antenna.. for the price and picture we were expecting alittle better product, but this is what we got.."
3,Way too big and heavy,"For what I needed, too large. Unfortunately, size was not in discription. They offered a return for credit on another item, however, I paid 13.75 shipping, will pay that much back & new shipping is 9.75. Plus the smaller unit is 10.00 more."
4,wonderful radio,i purchased the radio for myself while deployed to iraq to listen to my music. the radio works ans sound great. it has everything you need while being deployed to hear music. the radio is in good condition for being used. i do not mind that it was used because it is still in good condition. the only thing that confused me was that it had a external antenna line in the package but the radio had a antenna. overall it works good. thank you
3,"Coby Boombox Ok, not so boomy.","The Coby CX-CD282 Boombox has a muted boom (it's ok, but not earth shattering), fairly convenient controls and an adequate CD and tape player. I was somewhat disappointed with the analog AM/FM tuner, it didn't pick up as many stations as a cheaper radio, and the stereo effect was not obvious, but since that wasn't the primary reason for my purchase, I'm not going to complain. Sound quality was adequate, but not outstanding. Tone controls primitive."
2,AM-FM,"The AM-FM receiver in this unit is the worst i've ever used, the tuner itself is totally useless except for the closest and strongest stations, even they are hard to tune in. I would rate the tuner at one-fourth of a star just because it can make static.........."
2,Nice but could use more stuff,I bought this and thought it would work on it's own. When i played a cd the subwoofers didn't even. When i read the manual i was i needed a 15v dc adapter which i cannot find ANYWHERE! So if you get this be prepared to go on a wild goose chase for a 15v adapter. Or else stock up on batteries cause it uses TEN! damn who ever heard of a woofer being plugged in by itself. If i have nay luck with stereo I'll write another review until then i am frustrated with this company.
1,Disappointment,"I really thought this item would have been alot better.The sound was very distorted @ a loud volume.No bass what so ever,it was not very loud either.My advice to anyone purchasing this item is,do not buy it if you like clear sounding and loud bass music,it is not for you.Looks are deceiving in this case.However,Amazon is still a great place to buy,cheap and fast delivery,just don't recommend this item for users that like a clear sound."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I was excited when this beautiful piece of equipment arrived...meticulously packed and delivered in record time! My excitement diminished however when I first listened to its output. Compared to my old boombox with the sticky cd drawers the sound was shallow and kind of annoying, both for music and speaking voices. I'm not sure what the bass booster is all about - I didn't hear much bass. In the end I used my old unreliable player with the better sound. Now...of course I'm being very picky. I'm a musician and now realize that if I had wanted really good sound quality I should have purchased a look-alike model for $250. For its $50 pricetag this is probably still quite a nice package."
5,XTC Comes of Age,"This release is light years ahead of it's predesessor ""Go 2"" The hyperkinetic keyboards of Barry Andrews gone and thank goodness. What it does is place XTC out of the quirky band category (Oingo Boingo, Devo) and flushes out thier developing serious songwriting.This is XTC at a transitional stage and some of the songs are hyperkinetic romps like the old XTC (""Helicopter"", ""Outside World"", ""Scissor Man"") but many more show thematurity and growth going on. ""Making Plans For Nigel"" is a classic English pop song. In fact amny of Colin's contributions are brilliant. ""Day In, Day Out"" is a catchy pop number and his ballads ""Ten Feet Tall"" and ""That Is the Way"" show incredible progress in his songwriting. Andy also pens some classics like ""When Your Near Me"" and ""Roads Girdle The Globe"". A great mix of pop/rock/new wave that was in my opinion the greatest release of 1979."
4,a wire record on the drum,harking to a new era of ecstasy drums and wire is a loose elastic feel to it and the moulding partridge songwriting comes to life with hugh padgehams subtle and complementing production. the songs are more ordered than the previous album and show improvemnet over them by degrees. the songwriting too has improved and popular music has never sounded lyrically better. the results are a strong simple sound with durable lyrics.the sound owes a little to white reggae pop of the same or similar era similar for example to the police's walking on the moon or elvis costello's watching the detectives or the pretenders brass in pocket . white reggae influence with a skank if you dont mind.
2,"Linear plot, flat characters","I was very disappointed by this book. 3/4 through and it got so tedious that I put the book away. Characters are flat, they tend to fit into a fantasy stereotype (strong man, foppish noble, gallant leader, etc) and have one defining flaw/personality trait that is repeated over and over. There is no character development, no interesting interactions between the characters, and no real challenges in the plot. I am an avid Robert Jordan fan, and though some dislike his slow writing, the intricacy of his novels far surpass Drake's writing."
5,Great TV for work,This is a great buy. It has some extras that similar ones do not. The earphones are included and are stereo instead of mono (like others).
1,"If I could rate it a ""0"" I would...but 1 is the lowest choice!","I know that you can't expect much for under $20....and it was too good to be true. First, the dials are hard to use....then the sound was terruble and the picture quality was poor...and on and on. I guess if you're in a 3rd world country , this would be a good buy....but my advice is, ""Don't even consider this set !"" I sent it back as quickly as I could and felt stupid for even thinking that I could get a decent set with an AM-FM radio for this price."
4,"Not great, but really cheap","I like it. It's got poor resolution, it's hard to get the reception in, and if you're too close to it while it's on, the reception goes out, but it only cost 16 dollars, so I find it hard to complain."
2,"Disappointed, but can't beat price","The absolute best thing about this TV is the price. The absolute worst thing is its functionality. Reception is our area is okay, but there are many poorly designed features: 1. The knobs for volume and channel changing are almost impossible to turn. They're shaped like the half of a little golf ball with a sight indention for a thumb notch. If I were an older person or had arthritis, it'd be totally impossible to use. 2. The tuner indicator is difficult to read so it's hard to tell if you're on the right channel. Half the time you're guessing based on the program that's on. 3. The volume will suddenly jump to its maximum level and you'll have to thump the unit to bring it back to normal. 4. The antenna snapped off almost immediately after initial use. This might be best for emergency use, rather than as a secondary TV for the kitchen or workshop (which is how we're using it now)."
1,Do you feel lucky?,"If you do, go ahead and take a chance. I did and got burned. Tv didn't work right out of the box. Will return soon."
2,It works,"I put batteries in it to see if it worked. It did. It was cheap, for emergencies only, and that was what I wanted."
1,Don't Buy this tv!,"I ordered this tv a few weeks ago. When it came, the tuner didn't work and it would not tune in to tv stations at all. Amazon was real good about replacing it for another. When that one came, I took it out of the box and there was a completely different problem with that one! I could hear it just fine as it tuned in to different stations, but there was no picture at all! This one is going back too! What a waste of time and I am still without a tv in the room I was going to use this in because these small tvs are hard to find nowadays!"
3,cant tell.............Colby Tv came broken!!,"Dont know if this was a problem in shipp'g or way it was packagedbut inside the battery comprtment was the adapter to plug in.It was wedged in to plastic floor of the comprtment!! Was it toosmall to handle that? Dont know, dont care was gift fr niece'slittle girl, had to order something else at last minute"
3,"well, could have been perfect...","I would recommend this cd wholeheartedly except for a few songs, which seem out of place. I am sorry, but Tom Waites sardonic character, and raspy vocal timbre does not suit this Gospel music, neither does Chrissie Hynde's antithetical character or song delivery. It's a wonder they did not have Ozzy sing Little drummer. Well, I almost lost control of my car when 'Born in Bethlehem' played. That is one great track. I imagine they wanted crossover business for the pop crowd, but I wish they left out these wannabe's and stick to the roots. I guess that is not where the money is however."
2,"sounds like a tribute album - not good for Xmas, though","I have no doubt that the BBA could produce a solid gospel Christmas album. This isn't it.The concept here was to put a variety of well-known pop, rock, folk and global music performers in front, and keep the BBA more ""in the back."" The result is a very uneven, unfocused effort that comes across as a alt. tribute to the Christmas music tradition. On one level it is, well, sort of interesting (Me'Shell Ndegeocello doing Come all ye Faithful) but then it strays away from the wider meanings of Christmas, at the expense of becoming a holiday exercise or experiment for its own sake.Aaron Neville belly flops with Joy to the World as does Michael Franti with Little Drummer Boy. There are a few gems, however, and I commend In the Bleak Midwinter and Born in Bethlehem - buy them singly if you can."
4,Enjoyable enough to watch repeatedly as you practice,"Lindsay Wagners Acupressure Facelift instructional tape is enjoyable enough to play repeatedly even after you become familiar with this ancient technique. The wardrobe, lighting, camera angels and soft, oriental background music, are all well done. Lindsay gives clear, accurate instructions in a manner that is relaxing just to listen to. Enjoy learning the valuable beauty and health care benefits of Acupressure Facelift. As far as 'treat yourself tapes' go this is an excellent choice."
5,What a DEAL!!!,Great just what I wanted Saved a lot of money. Each stem costs $15 elsewhere.Everything fit perfectly. Like new faucets and they are 30 years old.
5,Adorable and handy!,"Matches my country kitchen decor perfectly. My puppy (70 lb 8 month old black lab) has never once tried to open it. Her ginormous bowl doesn't fit in it (LOL), so you'll have to use a scoop. We buy the 30 lb bags of food and it all fits without a problem. Would buy the cat one if I could find it to match!"
1,Eckert Instead,This book is a short novel in the French and Indian War. I did not find it particularly interesting. I much prefer Eckert's works.
2,Below average,"If you are like me, you have listened to many different renditions of Yellow River Concerto, starting with the conservative Ormandy version. This effort by Eileen Huang and China Central Orchestra, though perhaps more interesting and dramatic than the Ormandy version, falls short in many ways--mostly technically.If you know the piece well, you'd notice that the orchesta stumbles in the first 2 or 3 seconds--then the erratic small errors continue throuhout by both Huang and the orchestra. When the first piano solo section kicks in, Huang gets throuh the beginning fine, though somewhat tentatively, then she trips as the second four-time-repeat signature theme occurs--as does the orchestra... It's a mess.This continues all the way, until they let you down with ""Defend the Yellow River,"" with numerous small errors by both Huang and the orchestra.All in all, Huang remains tentative throuhout, making countless errors, and the orchestra doesn't really help."
2,Could be bettter,"The reviews from the seller made this sound much better than it was. The front legs are pose-able, but the rest are not. The kids play with the cheap set more than this one."
2,Ummm It's ok...,"Well, it looks really fake. I bought this to scare my colleagues but the result was unsatisfactory. I wish I had got some more life like product."
5,Orange Kneed Tarantula,"This is an excellent and durable toy that is about palm/hand sized (4 to 5 inches) It's legs are pose-able and it is actually pretty realistic looking! My son loves spiders, and so this was a great pick for him!"
1,Not *THE* ladytron !,"This album is *not* by the British band Ladytron who released the magnificent album ""604"". This Ladytron presents an album with mediocre rock that has been done better by many other bands. Best thing of this album is the cover."
1,caution: rock,for anyone in love with the commodore rock ep by ladytron be advised that this disc is not by the same band. this is some indie rock stuff that will go over very well with people who like sebadoh and the like.
5,Gorgeous!,"I am writing my first Amazon review ever for this cd, because I couldn't disagree more with the singular existing review. It's true, I would not have found this cd on my own (it was a gift), but now that I have it I can't stop playing it. No, I'm not going to put in on when I need pepping up or am in the mood for the original popalicious ""Friday I'm in Love"", because this is entirely different work. It is beautiful, sweeping, striking, interesting, relaxing, and an entirely pleasing set of instrumental versions of Cure songs. There is nothing muzak-y about it. If anything, it showcases the depth and complexity of the Cure's work because the songs translate so richly to this format. If you're remotely intrigued by the idea of this cd, and you're remotely open minded about what music can be to be great, this cd will indeed be worth the money."
5,good job,"The piano sounds real, not like a digital keyboard or heavily post-processed instrument. The touch on the notes is authentic, and it captures the emotion. It's not mechanical at all.I recommend it if you are a Cure fan."
1,Eh...No,"Ok... I'm an avid The Cure fan... but I can't believe what I'm hearing with this. I love paino music and The Cure so I thought this might be a good buy... I can't stand this. It's like Robert Smith elevater music... completely disrespectful. I don't think I've heard a more depressing verson of ""Friday I'm In Love"" ever... And I like that song. Not worth the cash."
4,Yay field hockey!,"I liked it so much I bought it as a gift. As a former field hockey player, how could I not like it."
3,Good cast,"This movie was almost too ridiculous but the cast wasexcellent. Some very good scenes and anything with ColinFirth, I buy. Watch it for what it is.....slapstick!!!!"
4,This Movie is such fun!,"This campy movie will probably be another Rocky Horror Picture Show or Monster Squad. The music is fun, a perfect teen movie. Worth a watch with popcorn & friends~What a HOOT!"
5,crass & crude but a helluva lot of fun - and played for it!,"Ok, we aren't talking Shakespeare here. The comedy is broad and a little crass BUT it's done so well and with such a sense of fun that you're drawn into it for an enjoyable romp. Rupert Everett handles the Miss Fritton role just as well as Alastair Sim over 50 years earlier.Well done and a lot of fun. Aw come on! Have a little guilty fun!"
4,FLUFFY BIT OF FUN,"This is not a high brow film. It is pure sugar - not recommended as a daily diet but great as a sweet snack. The original version and sequels were very risque for its day and this remake does a good job of trying to update the movie without going overboard.An English school that accepts those girls that have been thrown out of every other school is not only in financial trouble but the government means to make an example of them too. Will all of the different factions (goths, sexpots, toughies, geeks, etc.) of St. Trinian band together to save the day?Rupert Evertt does not do drag justice (which is amusing....) but all the characters are fun to watch. Colin Firth and Stephen Fry (brief cameo) were my favorites to watch. There are a lot of talented UK actors who appear in this movie and then there is a scene by Misha Barton.This movie has more of a cult following then strong comedy to recommend it. I do not think it will appeal to the masses but it is silly fun."
2,St Trinian's,This is a very entertaining DVD. Enjoyed it very much. Colin Firth as usual was very good as was Rupert Everette. Would recommend it to Colin Firth fans.
1,Comedy(?) for the brain-dead,"I seldom write negative reviews--I'd much rather rave about the movies and music that delight and surprise. The surprise here was that this movie is so bad that I was delighted to turn it off after twenty minutes and watch something worth a couple of hour of my life. I like silly humor (Rowan Atkinson in ""Johnny English"" and ""The Thin Blue Line"" comes to mind). This movie is silly, but it's difficult to see how it qualifies as humor."
1,NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE RAZZIES,"BECAUSE MY BRIDE OF 53 YEARS IS A FIRTH-OPHILE I'VE BEEN OBLIGED TO SQUIRM THROUGH THIS THOROUGHLY DEADFUL OPUS. COLIN SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF. I'D ADVISE HIM TO IMMEDIATELY BUY UP ALL EXISTING COPIES AND FIND A HAZARDOUS WASTE DUMP THAT WOULD TAKE THEM. THEN HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DISAVOW ALL KNOWLEDGE OF IT. ""PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE"" WAS EVER SO MUCH MORE FUN THAN THIS INSULTING OFFENSE TO GOOD TASTE. ""ZABRISKIE POINT"" HAD FAR MORE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE."
1,Lacking the lust...,"Okay, I'll be honest, I have never heard of this story and its 30 or 40 year history. I am a guy and I rented this movie to see some hot girls, unfortunately that is absolutely NOT what you get here. I was shocked and disappointed to find that what you do get is a whole story about some guy dressed in drag *shudder!* And eighty percent of the girls that you do see are only twelve. The main character is cute but not hot until the end, and then she is only mentioned as an afterthought.Sadly, the next best thing that you look for is plot and story. There is none. Everybody reading this can definitely write a better screenplay and I encourage them to do so. There are a few quirky moments, but not enough for a full feature-- perhaps just enough for a one half hour episode.I give it one star for the cover, which shows some of the hot background characters, and of course the final musical number. That did rock!"
5,Moving!,"Ms. Johnson's, THE ALLEY of WISHES, moved me to tears. I cannot remember how long it has been since I have read such a wonderful story. I hope this writer has more books lined up for the very near future."
5,Pure Poetry,"""The Alley of Wishes"" is one of the best books I've ever read. The author's poetic prose and sense of drama combine to deliver a powerful story of tragedy and triumph. Ms. Johnson portrays World War II-torn Paris so realistically and writes with such knowledge of the era, culture, and locale, it is easy to become lost in that time. Wonderful book. I would love to see a lot more by this author."
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"""The Alley of Wishes"" by Laurel Johnson reads like a classic of yester-year. Ms. Johnson writes in a beautifully poetic style and tells the love story between Beck and Cerise in such a way that the reader feels part of this moving story. Never have I read a book so wrought with emotion, feeling as if I had stepped into that time and place to experience the sadness and despair, the pain and anguish, the love and joy. If I could rate this book higher than the 5 stars, I would. It's beyond perfection and is a book you will not want to put down and one that will stay with you long after you've finished it."
1,Manufacturing fault,"The blades were so blunt, they were unusable. Retailer gave me full refund for all 40 blades without even taking back the blades. I have thrown them in trash."
2,Not clear recording,I purchased this recorder for the main purpose of recording my music classes. I was very displeased with the built in mic and the clarity of playback was poor.
1,bad,the machine didn't work so i had to buy another one at walmart i actually found.the other one worked great while this one failed tl work.glad i returned
1,coby portable am/fm does not work after 6 mths,"I purchased this cassette player in February, the warranty ran out in March and it began eating my cassettes in the beginning of Sept. I just wanted something to play old cassettes for school purposes. It ate my $10.00 history cassette. I tried a couple of more cassettes to see if it could be the cassettes themselves but it was the player. I probably wouldn't complain as much if it had at least lasted the whole school year. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. In the long run you will lose more money than you save buying it. I am very disappointed. I did not contact the seller because it is passed the warranty and I would have to pay to send it back. Though it does say I can get a partial refund. Maybe I'll still do that.Coby Portable AM/FM Cassette Player and Recorder CX244, Silver/Blue"
3,Portable am/fm cassette,"The portable player works ok,but like a lot of the newer portable players there is a small power hum when it's pluged into a outlet.The older portable players had better transformer shielding and probably used better transistors.I don't think you will get the hum with battery power.Still for the price not that bad."
1,Truly Horrible Product,"I have only had this piece of junk a little over thirty days and it has literally fallen apart. Of course now, I can't return it. First the rewind button got stuck in, so I had to take it completely out. Today, the Stop/Eject button did the same thing, and now I have to use a pair of scissors to open the tape compartment because even with the plastic button removed, the lever does not open the door. I needed a tape player to transfer some old audio tapes to cd. Do not buy this product."
1,"If you care about your cassettes, do not buy Coby.","My son falls asleep to cassette recordings from his grandmother.Well, my ex-wife took his cassette player to her new house and I had to go out and buy one. The only cassette player in the store was Coby. It worked fine for the first two days, then began eating tapes. I couldn't get the tapes untangled and they kept breaking. I finally gave up and figured out how to record the tapes to CD and threw away this piece of junk from Coby. I also had a Coby DVD player as a free giveaway promotion. That device lastest exactly one day. It too had to be junked.Coby is absolutely the worst manufacturer of any product that I've ever encountered. I really wish Amazon would let us give zero stars. They forced me to choose one."
1,Worked for a few months,"My bro gave this to my mom as all her oldies are on cassette. It worked for about 5 months or so. I don't recall exactly how many months, but not even a year. It started chewing the tapes. I am technical and tried to see if the rubber was out of alignement etc. I messed with it, and it still continues to eat the tapes. I'm going with a known brand this time thus I'm hear searching for another one, and definetely want to give Coby potential customers the real heads up."
1,eats tapes,I received this cassette player and it chopped clean the tape in the cassettes. This pile of tapes hadn't been listened to for a long time so I thought it was my old player. But then it ate a couple including one of my favorites. The player it was supposed to replace was a $15 player that worked for years. Boycott them.
3,cassette player,OK product for the money. Arrived in a timely manner. the sound is OK. Seems to work OK just dont expect a big stereo sound.
3,Learn How To Use Some Other Company's Software In A Weekend,"I bought this book assuming I would learn HTML and I did to a small extent. There absolutly nothing wrong with the way Callihan instructs the reader, in fact he writes to people who have just purchased a computer or a modem. However the most advanced HTML programming learnt in the book is creating tables, stuff which can be learnt on-line without a hassle. For forms and frames however he just teaches you how to use shareware programs included on the CD and not how to do the pure HTML code. This book also includes a tutorial on Paint Shop Pro and a nice little reference for HTML code which I liked. The book has it's high points but is intendend for beginners, and if you know how to program advanced tables in HTML, stay the hell away from this book."
3,Learn HTML in a Weekend,"Good introductory HTML book & CD, but once I hit the Web Forms chapter and realized I was being taught to use a pre-packaged software (WebForms) instead of learning pure HTML forms creation, I was ready to throw the book away. The author did himself a big disservice by taking this route."
3,Helped me learn HTML a little better,A good book for someone that is starting out new trying to learn HTML. Good examples throughout the book along with CD Rom that comes with the book.
5,Turns the Novice into an Experienced User,"I originally bought this book at a Barnes and Noble, but eventually made my way to Amazon.com to purchase it for my friends! This book is a VERY thorough HTML tutorial, using step-by-step examples that draw on the many samples and software included on the accompanying CD-ROM. Its hands-on approach made learning inevitable! I read it in three days, and by the end of the week I had created my own website (using frames) from scratch! www.rondestefano.com"
2,Not for me!,I expected creating a web page to interesting and exciting. This book is dreadfully technical and downright boring.
5,Amazing Old School Boot,"This Timberland Boot is the real deal,those who purchase the so called Wheat color ones have no idea that they are no use to you when it rains or it's freezing temperatures outdoors. The Super Tims Boot does it all, they should have never stop selling this boot...NO, boot and I mean no other boot comes close..I am ordering 2 pairs...WHAT A BOOT."
3,cannot recommend,"I was encouraged and educated about nutrition and proper rest, but the slant of the book is really for fraternal twin moms. At one point the authors said something to the effect that most of us were children in the ""50's and 60's:, clearly they were sending their message to older moms, not very inclusive in my opinion. Information for riskier mo/mo pregnancies or TTTS pregnancies was scarce. There was also a recommendation for fish oil supplements that made me uncomfortable. There is mixed information available regarding the safety of fish oil while pregnant. It can be used in higher doses to induce labor, and although some extra omega fatty acids would be great, the threat of pre-term labor outweighs that benefit for me. I really wanted to like this book and I am sure it is very helpful to many, but it didn't offer the kind of information and anecdotal evidence I am looking for in my reading for my pregnancy. I couldn't recommend this book."
5,"Critical Advice, a Must Read","I wish all mothers expecting twins would read this book. My ObGyn had little advice on how to take my twins to term except to rest and not stress. Well, what does that mean? This book detailed exactly what this means and more. I followed the advice on what to eat and how much to rest and gave birth to very healthy babies, weighing seven pounds each. The authors' suggestion to drink nutrition shakes proved to be critical to my healthy weight gain, as I could keep very little else down for the first two trimesters, especially prenatal vitamins. Later I followed the advice on eating a lot of the right kinds of fats in salmon, cheeses, and nuts in order for my babies to reach their optimal weight. I put on a total of fifty four pounds, all of which melted away after six months. I cannot say enough good things about this book."
4,Good information,"This book has great information on having a multiple pregnancy that I haven't been able to find anywhere else. It really informs you on how to take care of yourself the best way possible to try and insure a healthy pregnancy and outcome. Sometimes I worry about if I am eating enough and if I am eating enough of the ""right"" things. One person referenced in the book said she made flashcards for each day to help make sure she was getting the correct amount of food. I wish they would sell those! It really prepares you for every step of the pregnancy and there after."
5,Great!,This was a great read! I highly recommend this to anyone having multiples. This was probably the best book I've read so far about having twins.
4,read it early in your pregnancy,"I found this book very helpful, and only wish that I knew about it earlier in my prgnancy."
4,Good Information,I am Prego with Boy/Girl Twins due in May 2007. This book was very informational but like with any advice or information you do have to filter out the stuff that might not apply or be practical.
5,YOUR TWINS NEED YOU TO GET THIS BOOK!!,This book is worth its weight in gold. I was shocked to find out I was having twins and came across this book which opened my eyes to how different a multiple pregnancy is from a singleton pregnancy. I read and reread this book during my pregnancy and even read it now after the twins have arrived - it was a fabulous resource on everything from my emotional state to how and what to eat to how to survive once the twins arrive (I am surviving just fine!) to how to eat while breastfeeding multiples. I truly believe that this book and the information in it played a large part in me carrying my twins to 35 1/2 wks and them being born large (6 lb 1 oz and 6 lb 3 oz) and healthy. I urge you to get this book if you're expecting more than one baby - you need to understand what is going on in your body and understand how important nutrition and rest is for your growing babies - Dr. Luke explains it all in a way that is easy to understand and comprehend. Good luck!
5,"Hands down, the best available resource.","I live in a rural community and have limited access to physicians. My OB wasn't treating my twin pregnancy as if it were anything special. It took a while to find a book that was about more than ""Should their names rhyme?"" and ""Should they sleep in the same bed?"" I am a very experienced mother of 7 who is having her first set of twins, and the information in this book is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I needed to know what was special about twin pregnancies... the risks, the concerns, the diet, and what I could do to give myself the very best odds. If you are looking for a volume on twin pregnancy, this is THE book."
1,RE: This Book Freaked Out My Wife,"This is a follow-up to my review of January 2004:Contrary to the advice in this book, my wife finally decided she didn't need to spend all day stuffing her face with junk food. She ate when she was hungry and the ammount she felt like eating. My twins were born 6lb 2oz and 6lb 13oz at 37&1/2 weeks. They are 6 months old now and the healthiest kids I've ever seen."
2,questionable advice,"This book has some good information, but also some very questionable advice. For example, the author supports eating fast food (burgers, fries and breakfast biscuits) to achieve required caloric intake. I don't agree with this--fast food is full of empty calories with low nutritional value. My experience is that growing healthy babies requires eating a well balanced diet that includes whole milk dairy products, whole grains, meats, fruits and vegetables (preferably organic)."
2,useless,"Other people w/twins recommended this book, but I found it pretty worthless. Here's basically what it says: eat a high protein diet, especially early in pregnancy b/c you won't have as much appetite by your third trimester. Why do you need to spend the money on this book for that? I've already summarized the whole book for you... Good luck."
5,I gave it credit for my healthy triplets,"My triplets are now 2 (so I have time to write this). I followed this book's instructions closely from almost the day I found out I was having 3 (at ten weeks). It was alarming on the first read, but throughout the weeks of bed rest I found it to be a great stress reliever. I suspect it's warnings are especially applicable for women over 35."
4,Very helpful book,"I delivered very healthy approx 5 lb baby boys at 35 weeks, and I think their health is in large part due to the diet recommendations in this book. I didn't follow it to the T, using the recipes in the back, etc, but I kept a lot of the key points in mind when choosing what to eat, making sure that I was getting a sufficient amount of calories in the right way.I didn't find out I was having twins until the 20 week ultrasound. I had been tracking perfectly for a singleton up until then, so I'm sure that if I had known and had found this book earlier, I might have made it a little longer. As it was, the boys only had to stay in the Level 2 nursery (no NICU) for a couple weeks while they learned to suck. Other than that, they were quite healthy.A good resource for moms expecting multiples. So few books explain how to do things right for a multiples pregnancy. It's not the same as a singleton one, and most pregnancy books just include multiples as an afterthought."
5,The BEST Multiple Pregnancy book on the market,"The day I found out I was pregnant with twins, I joined a 'mothers of twins' club online. This was the first and only book they recommended. Prior to finding out I was pregnant with twins, I thought I knew everything there was to know about pregnancy and childbirth, but as soon as I found out there were two in there, I was dumbfounded! I ran out the very next day and bought this book. I went home and read it from cover to cover. What a gold mine! It answered all of my questions and informed me early on that a twin pregnancy is MUCH different than a singleton pregnancy. I now recommend it to everyone I meet that is pregnant with multiples. Thank you Dr. Barbara Luke!"
5,MUST HAVE for mother expecting twins or more!,"I wish I had got this book the day after I found out I was having twins! I didn't get it until I was 6 1/2 months pregnant(I found out i was expecting twins at 5 months). This book is extremely informative. In fact it was passed out to all the moms at the childbirth class I took specifically designed for moms expecting multiple babies. The book helped me realize that I wasn't eating and resting enough as a mom of twins, so I promptly took it easy and gained the recommended weight by eating as healthy as possible. If you are expecting multiple babies, you really do need to read this book and follow the advice. I'm due in a few weeks and my babies are already at healthy weights based on my last ultrasound. I've read it 3 times and will continue to read it until my babies arrive. This book is so worth reading!"
5,Great resource for mothers of twins,"When I realized I was carrying twins, I wanted to read everything I could about it. This was THE BEST resource I found. It was so good, that it resulted in me carrying my babies 39 weeks, and delivering 7 lb. 3 oz. & 6 lb. 9 oz. healthy baby boys. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone expecting multiples."
5,indispensable for twin parents,It is more than a survival kit and complements most readings I had for twin pregnancies. It is a mandatory reading if you want to go through a twin pregnancy smoothly. It provides scientific background to the recommendations presented. I highly recommend this reading.
5,An Absolute Necessity for Moms Expecting Multiples!,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who had twin boys. My husband and I truly consider this book one of the main reasons I was able to carry our twins to 38 weeks with no complications for me or the babies. My doctors worried that because of my size (4 ft 10 in, 100 lbs before pregnancy), I would have complications. But this book gave me exactly the advice I needed to ensure my health and safety, and the health and safety of my twins. We surprised everyone when we made it to 38 weeks on the dot and gave birth to two healthy boys - 5 lbs. 1 oz. and 5 lbs 13 oz.If you are expecting multiples, this is the book for you!"
4,Pretty good pick,"This book is very readable, and includes chapters about how multiples are conceived, fetal development, nutrition, medical procedures, prenatal care specific to multiples, bedrest, and information about neo-natal intensive care units. It is a nice combination of professional (medical) and personal advice. The only thing I don't like about the book is the strict emphasis on caloric intake for women expecting multiples--I'm not sure how any woman can ever eat 4,500 calories a day to sustain a quadruplet pregnancy! It is a nice resource for pregnancy for any woman expecting more than one baby...whether it's twins or 6 babies!"
4,Glad I read it.,This book has very specific things for twins and also general pregnancy. The reason I liked it it is because It helped me realize why this pregnancy is different. Since this is my third pregnancy I was ready to treat it like a normal pregnancy. but so far it has been anything but normal.I don't love that the book seems to advertise a lot! I already bought your book you don't need to keep convincing me.
3,just an okay book,"this book did offer much more nutritional information that found in other multiple book that are out there, however was not that informative for me this being my third pregnancy.overall not a bad book, but didn't answer all of my questions either."
4,good book,very informative....I got this when I found out I was pregnant with twins...I would recommend this book for sure...I used it daily...I followed the guidelines as best I could...even though I could NEVER have eaten as much as suggested...it was a terrific guide !
5,A must have book for twin mums-to-be,"Upon receiving it I felt a bit daunted by the absence of pictures that most other pregnancy books have and I thought that I would find it difficult to read. How wrong was I: I read the entire book in a single afternoon!!! It's so easy to read, it gives you such useful information. It even made me feel good about gaining weight, which I was so apprehensive about! I definitely recommend all women who are expecting multiples to buy this book."
5,The Definitive Book on Twin Pregnancy,"As far as I'm concerned, there is no comparison between this book and other books about being pregnant with twins (or more). It provides more current, accurate and helpful information than any other book I bought or considered purchasing. It was my ""bible"" during my pregnancy with twins."
4,Targeted information for parents expecting multiples,"As a first time mother expecting twins, I have a lot of questions. I've read What to Expect and the other top-selling pregnancy books, but most only spent a page or two discussing multiple pregnancies.Dr. Luke goes into a lot of detail regarding nutrition. Granted, some of this advice differed from what my OB suggested, but this book gave me the confidence to split the difference and feel more comfortable designing a diet that will support my twins and keep them cooking as long as possible without excessive weight gain on my part.This book is a great way to amend general pregnancy resources with the tools to better understand the specific needs of multiple pregnancies."
5,Great book for twins (or more) on the way,"Great book for your twins (or more) on the way. I found it a good read. There are some parts I skimmed through, but all in all highly recommend!"
5,Great Book!,"Just a short note to say that I followed this book about 95% and my twins were born at 37 weeks, were 20 inches long and 6 lbs 12 oz. and 7 lbs 8 oz. It works and is VERY sound advice for a multiples pregnancy. I recommend it to everyone I meet who is carrying more than one baby!"
5,39 weeks!,I truly believe this book help my twins get to 39 weeks... 6LB 11 OZ and 6LB 14 OZ! Is there a follow up to this book on how to take care of them after they are born? I could sure use that!
5,The greatest multiple resource,"This book is wonderful. The authors go into great detail of the importance of gaining weight (regardless of your size) and the book provides breakdowns on carb, protein, and fat distribution in a multiple diet. I read several books but, this one is the only one that I need. It covers possible complications in a multiple pregnancy and it it hints the importance of bedrest and taking it easy throughout the pregnancy. My goal in my pregnancy is to have healthy big babies and this book provides the guidelines to accomplish that!"
1,Ridiculous advice,"I ran out to buy this book as soon as I found out I was having twins. Needless to say, my husband found me in tears when he came home several hours later. The weight and diet requirements are unrealistic. The authors insist that you eat no less than 7 times a day (endorsing junk food!), drink 128 oz. of water a day, and if you're not gaining weight early on like it's your job, they almost guarantee you'll have sickly preemies at 30 weeks. The book uses awful scare tactics like claiming you're doctor likely knows nothing about multiple pregnancies and will lead you astray, which is sure to terrify any parent already overwhelmed by news of multiple births. I'm ecstatic about my twins, and multiple birth pregnancies do entail special care, but all this book did was compound my fears."
2,More sell pitch than inform,"This book told you how great the author's clinic was, but very little of useful information about your pregnancy. It said you must gain a lot of weight thru any mean possible, including eating junk food. If you didn't follow their advice, your babies would be born premature and/or have low birth weight.I was depressed after reading the book. I read ""What to Expect..."" instead, and loved it! I followed their advice and gained only 30 lbs, not 40-50 lb as this book suggested. At 37 weeks, I gave birth to a 8 lb boy and 6 lb 12 oz girl."
2,NOT GREAT...Be careful,"I don't like the layout of this book, it's chapters and it's so hard to find a subject in the index. I also don't like the repeated real-life stories that tend to be more distracting than helpful. Probably the worst part of this book is the weight gain recommendations. Both my OB's disagree with the book's recommendations. If you go by what the book recommends, be prepared to gain way more weight than you should which can lead to serious complications. Stick with your doctor's recommendations for your specific needs. The other information in the book was fine and helpful enough, but it's not anything you couldn't figure out yourself or find in any other multiples book."
3,a so-so book,"I was not that crazy about this book, although my wife really liked it. We are expecting twins in July, and everybody we spoke to recommended this book. I think the author is a little to rigid in her recommendations. The part about diet seems impossible to follow and is bound to overwhelm anyone who reads it."
5,The perfect multiples pregnancy guide!,"This is the perfect book to help pregnant mothers of multiples to not obsess about their pregnancy. I recently delivered 4 healthy baby boys and would like to personally thank Dr. Luke and Ms. Eberlein for a sensible, practical, and intelligent book that doesn't feed on a womans' insecurities. This book gave me the knowledge base to ask the ""right"" questions. As well as, strong guidelines and anecdotes on how I could help give my babies the best start in life. I highlighted many, many pages and found myself re-reading sections. This book empowers the pregnant woman to think positive by explaining possible pregnancy complications, birth expectations,and neo-natal experience, while maintaining a positive focus. It is the only book I found that addresses the many issues of a multiples pregnancy and reaches out to would be mothers of quadruplets!"
3,"Interesting, but who wants to gain 85 lbs?","I thought this book was very interesting, but when I asked my doctor about the advice on how much weight you should gain (I was WAY behind their suggestions) she laughed and told me that she saw ""No reason you should pork out as long as the babies are growing well...you will have to loose that weight someday."" So, run it by your doctor and take it with a grain of salt-- I only gained 45 lbs and my twins were 6lbs and 6lbs 12 oz. and I was induced at 37 weeks. I was glad that when all was said and done, I only had about 5lbs of real fat to loose to get back to my prepregnancy weight of 130 (5'6'')"
5,Invaluable Guide,"I bought this book from Amazon the moment I knew that my wife was expecting twins. We tried following all the recommendations in the book throughout her pregnancy. She had a full-term twin pregnancy, right into the 39th week, normal singleton birth weight for both twins and zero days in the ICU.What we really like about this book was the very positive message it carried. All the support, love and prayers of our friends and loved ones helped a lot too."
3,Whoops! QuarkXPress Did It Again,"Paranoia is the key word here. QuarkXPress' software writers are so intent on focusing on security that they have ignored functionality. QuarkXPress clashes and crashes with some of our other software programs. Worse yet, I have had two instances when the software has refused to open after we have finished huge student publications. Can you imagine the frustration that resulted from having to re-do entire publications on deadline from scratch? The QuarkXPress service representatives were of no help. They seem not to understand their own product. We still use the software because the publication industry does, but we are now looking at some emerging alternatives. Some of my fellow teachers have had it with the software and want to get rid of it. The unexplainable crashes in publications and student productions are routine. I keep hoping Quark's software writers will wake up, but they don't seem to get it. Too bad. QuarkXPress used to be the industry standard."
2,Cannot support their differential pricing,"While quark recommended price is $1045 (and Amazon sells it for $799), Amazon appears to be prohibited from selling it at that price outside America.In other countries such as Europe and Africa, one has to pay EUR 1770 or $2130!So while it is definitely an excellent product, I cannot support such differential pricing of a product!"
4,Memories,My father is very ill and I wanted a locket to place a picture of him in it. I did not want the cutesy heart lockets not to mention very hard to get a picture in it. I liked the square look of this one. It is large to get a really good picture in it so that you do not have to squint to see it. Also it is not very heavy for one's neck.
4,Works great...,"I picked this scent because both my husband and I use cleaning wipes. I didn't want something flowery that would turn him off. When I popped open the top of these expecting the scent of cucumber I was hit with the scent of... who knows what, but it wasn't cucumber!I didn't say anything to my husband, not wanting to sway his opinion. He came in to check out the new chemical-free cleaning wipes that were being forced on him. He opened them up and said, ""What are these supposed to smell like?"" He also thinks they smell pretty bad.I'd buy them again but next time I'll try the other scent. Hopefully it's better. Fortunately, the scent is pretty light and as long as you're just cleaning with them it's fine. Even if they both stink, I'd still buy them because they work for cleaning and they don't have chemicals."
5,Easy reading bible,The CEV version of the bible uses modern day language. It's like reading a novel. Some days I can't put it down.
5,Amy R,My children (ages 14-17) LOVE this Bible! My 8 year old newphew saw it and HE wants it. Some of my kids friends were over and THEY all want one. They said they would LOVE to read the Bible--all the stories-- in this everyday modern language. The LOVE it!I have to place an order now for several more as they will make great gifts.
5,Hip Update of Classic King James Bible,"I was given a copy of this version of the Bible by my pastor. Christians and Jews accepted the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, as holy scripture. Teachings vary depending on what church you go to. We figured out at my church, they have earned the right to do whatever they want, as Martin Luther opened the doorway to religious freedom. This is a hip update of the King James Bible, and contains all the same books and chapters, but was translated with post modern age society in mind, not the dated Olde English of the King James, and is a lot easier to read than any other genuine version of the Holy Bible accepted by Christians as the gospel and scripture. It's at a fourth grade reading level."
1,I hate giving a Bible a one but....,the cover of this book is terrible and not the original one I bought. It was a solid blue cover and then it went on backorder and the flower one is what I got. I had to give it away.
1,Not Kindle friendly,"All the reviews are based on the readability of the CEV Bible. There is no question that it is easier to read BUT no one has talked about the functionality of the CEV Bible on the Kindle. You can easily go to any book of the Bible BUT there is no way to go to a SPECIFIC verse without using the search function which is not always accurate. For example, if I typed ""proverbs 8"" it will lead me to the 8th chapter of proverbs. But if I type in a specific verse such as ""proverbs 8:2"" it will give me a ""no results found"" message.For my review I would give it 4 stars for readability but I would give it 1 star for functionality on the Kindle."
4,CEV BIBLE,"Without going into an extensive review, let me just give you MYunderstanding.1. This Bible is an excellent choice for those just beginning their spiritual journey.2. This should be used with a concordance for accurate translations of the original Hebrew and Greek languages.3. As with any other purchase, individual research should be done to make a confident decision. This is CLEARLY such an example. The 'Berkley' edition is a very close contender!4. The CEV gives clear instruction without the ancient dialog of the King James. Not taking away from the KJ as it is an old standby, but is limited in regard to our language today.5. Most important to me is the ""understandability"" of the text.If I have to ask someone to translate for me, I may as well read the original greek text....."
2,Too Small!,This book was too small therefore the wording could not be read without straining (even with glasses). Would not recommend.
1,I didn't order it,"Although it would be great, I didn't order it and if I did it was a mistake as I was trying to figure out how to download on my new Kendle"
2,Too big for iPhone,"There are just too many pages for the Kindle iPhone app. It is difficult to search. And it is very complicated to go directly to Book, Chapter, and Verse. There must be better Bibles available for Kindle...or, is the problem with the Kindle??"
1,Finding verses,"I've never had a CEV Bible and was looking forward to reading this translation. However, there is no table of contents making it very difficult to find what you need. The location value goes to 45,000 and you just have to guess where the book you want to read is located. And keep narrowing it down. The book is definitely not formatted for a Kindle."
5,amazing,I was looking for a way to use my Bible without the 'big book' disadvantages. The CEV Holy Bible format is excellent and it gives a very comprehensive coverage of this translation in a form that is easy to manage. Thankyou!
2,Disappointed,Very disappointed that there is no chapter list (kindle version). It's difficult to go straight to the text if you have no reference point.
2,Love this bible translation but not a great Kindle product.,"I'm all about the CEV when it comes to reading the bible personally or out loud. I kind of expected this to, like my other kindle purchases, have a table of contents all hyperlinked to the various books of the bible. It did not, so finding a specific book to read from is a pain."
4,Like this version,"Doesn't always match the king James version, but it does make reading easier.You still need to study both but CEV is easier to understand."
5,Awesome selection of bands,"Wow, this soundtrack has one of the best metal bands selection I've ever see. Maybe not all of them with their best songs, but overall they're all great.So-called chaos said ""Horribly cliché-like with tons of poser punk pop bands"" ??? an Evanescence and Avril Lavigne fan...and he confuse metal with pop punk...OMG...uttermost ignorance..."
5,Best Soundtrack Ever made..,"Metal, Metal, METAL!!! Thats the way only way I will ever buy a soundtrack from a movie. And the bonus is that there are no emo/screamo/punk/mainstream sh*t on it that really only use 1 or 2 chords on this soundtrack...GET THIS SOUNDTRACK!!!!!!!!!!!To say that these bands on this soundtrack only use 1 or 2 chords, proves only one thing...Your an uneducated adolesent moron who has a taste for talentless shi*t bands..."
1,Just like the movie...,"...Really, really dissapointing. Horribly cliché-like with tons of poser punk pop bands that belt out a tune with two chords only. It's noise for nothing, and it sucks.Huskily one-note. Eeew."
1,Don't Buy,The radio is weak; doesn't pull in any normally strong signals. The sound quality is poor. The bass boost is a joke. Cheap looks and controls. Not worth what I paid.
1,horrible,"Before this I had a Sony discman for about 6 years which worked perfectly until eventually it got so old the glue dried out. I replaced it with this coby and have been very disappointed. Within about a 2 weeks the headphones (which kinda hurt) broke. Then about 6 months later the plastic holding the cover down cracked, so now the cover doesn't open and close properly. About 2 weeks after that the screen cracked. After 7 months this cd player was now functioning worse than the sony I'd had for 6 years.It has great features and seems like a great buy, but it breaks easily. Invest another $5-10 and get a name brand, like sony or philips, that you can use for years."
2,Overrated album by one of the most overrated bands,"I've given fair listenings to both this and ENGLISH SETTLEMENT. I wanted to like the stuff, but is Partridge trying to be the English boy-next-door or something? The lyrics are clearly trying to be clever but the rhymes fall flat for me. And the music is trying to break through to some kind of originality, to add a dash of the progressive to the pop, but that fails too, goes nowhere. And that voice, ohhh...like an early 80s New Wave Brit guy trying to say something alternately playful and serious but in that rounded, wry fashion that drags the notes. And why is he so...happy?"
4,A pop masterpiece worthy of all it's praise,"You can literally hear entire band's basing their sounds on concepts found on simply one of the many different styled tracks on the album (ex: Earn Enough For Us=post-Core STP).. One of the few albums that can hold a candle to the pop mastery and versatility demonstrated by The Beatles on their later work. To my ears, this even surpasses some of the regal pop masterpiece albums those godfathers released, taking pop music into a classier more eccentric and well constructed realm then anyone could have guessed. These are the types of albums that should be true mainstream classics, not the underground stapels they have become."
5,Skyloving,"All of the reviews herein hit it right on the head: At first listen, Skylarking is just ""o.k."". It takes a few times to really get it. But now, 17 years later, it's as beautiful as ever. Hasn't ever left my car. XTC fan or not: Must have for all!"
5,Pretty good radio,"I've had my radio for about three years now and it's a pretty good value. The radio is quite light and is easy to carry while exercising. It comes with a belt clip or a special cord which allows you to hang the radio from your neck. Radio reception is pretty good on both AM and FM.The included earphones are adequate, but you may find them to be a little uncomfortable for long periods of time as they are not ""sculpted"" to the shape of the ear. I personally use my own.Overall, due to its light weight and good radio reception, this radio is highly recommended if you like to listen to the radio while exercising."
1,Very difficult to tune FM stations,"not practical. i thought that I would have good FM reception, but it is hard to tune."
1,1 star seems to nice,"This was the first it what seems to be an endless quest for a good working radio. It was hard to get the stations in and those that did come in where kind of fuzzy. It didn't seem to work well when joggin. Like the stations would fade in and out from the bouncing. I'm not sure what the deal was. I spent $10 on it, but after a while the $10 here and there is making me look foolish."
1,The worse textbook I've had since I started school,"Poorly written, little details, little insight into trend forecasting. Author simply restates a series of facts. Really disappointing"
4,Seems to help,"My short term memory is really bad and my focus sometimes can be horible too. I tried these pills and they did nothing for my short term memory, but they really helped a lot with my focus and concentration. I plan to continue to use this product."
2,Don't know if it works but it sure upsets the digestive tract.,I bought this to help me study for the GRE. I don't know if it worked or not. But it certainly caused quite a bit of digestive upset.
5,awesome,"Very good product, I replaced my sons prescription with this. He is also pleased. No side effects. Its orth a try."
4,They work!,"Love these tablets, they really do help me to focus.I've been buying for over 3 years now, and really notice if I stop taking them for a few weeks. The only problem with this last batch was tho the date is good thru 12/13, the tablets themselves have darkened and have a strong B vitamin taste.Hopefully its just these that were maybe left in a 150 degree warehouse or something. Because I have ordered them many times before online and never had this problem.Focus Factor does work, you'll notice before 2 weeks."
1,Don't waste your money,"This product does not work. It made me irritable and I felt confused while taking this product. I found out one of the ingredients DMAE is a irritant and is used in skin creams, but it damages skin. Here is a quote form the real age web site ""DMAE: This so-called ""instant facelift"" ingredient in wrinkle creams works by damaging cells, which causes slight swelling. Yes, the swelling smoothes out wrinkles temporarily, but that doesn't mean it's good for your skin. """
4,Well made but not heavy duty!,The flag was just as ordered. And the price was great.If you wanted a flag to put outside for long periods of time- maybe not so good.MLB
4,A fresh look at a favorite premise,"Amnesia. Mistrust. A husband and wife finding each other--and themselves--again or for the first time. All are common themes in today's romance, and risk being overdone. But Karen Rose Smith's obvious enthusiasm for the traditional and her extraordinary talent make this book a true keeper.Jenny is a strong heroine who thrives despite the uncertainty amnesia brings. And it is always satisfying to watch a hero acknowledge his own shortcomings, and grow past them. Ms. Smith is a master."
2,Feel apart after first washing,"Two things you need to know about baby towels. One, buy them thick, don't waste your money on thin towels. Second, you wash them a lot therefore they need to hold up. Well this set met only one of my requirements. These were the only thick towels I could find at Babies R Us. The rest were thin and only good to line the baby tub with. Problem, I take the towel out of the dryer and the seams in the hood were coming loose. I liked the thickness of these towels so much I registered for the blue set and bought the green set, both before my son was born. Well, my little guys comes, needs a bath and sure enough, both sets of these towels begin to fall apart and both in the hooded part of the towel. But as I stated earlier, there aren't a lot of good, thick hooded towels out there. So unless you want to go to Pottery Barn and pay $30 for a hooded towel, these are your best bet, just get ready to sew them up when they come out of the dryer."
4,cool jam,this is another tight song in the lionel richie catelog. very cool and smoothed out cut. vocally he ain't lost a thing and he just stays direct and to the point. cool smooth jam.
2,"Some good, mostly bad","Let's start with what I liked. The unit was small and apparently well manufactured. It had lots of setup options and was usable right out of the box. It is really nice to have a DVD player I can use on a computer as well as a TV. However some fundamental problems forced me to return the unit.1 - The remote is cute but totally disfunctional. It is really small which seems good on the surface but it is just too small to use. The letters are so small you cannot read them without a magnifying glass. Furthermore, it has almost no range so you have to be very close for it to work at all.2 - The picture is not great. There is lots of pixelization and artifacts.3 - I didn't care for the open/close functionality or the position of the on/off button.I would only recommend this unit for a person that didn't care about picture quality or using the remote control."
1,A disappointment!,"I bought this since it could interface to both my laptop PC and my TV. Great concept, but poor execution. Massive artifacts/pixellation on DVDs with any kind of compression. Also, it does not play MP3 files at the correct bit rates. Back it goes!"
3,Merle Haggard's early days as a Lefty Frizzell-type singer,"This album is not so much a Merle Haggard does Jimmie Rodgers album but is more accurately an album inspired by a Jimmie Rodgers tribute album by Lefty Frizzell. Frizzell was Haggard's biggest and most enduring influence. While Merle was aware of Rodgers, he learned of Rodgers' impact through Frizzell (whose idol was Rodgers).Compared with Merle's latter and bluesier Rodgers covers, this album still shows an artist who is still learning. The true Merle Haggard style was being born here. Some track hint at the future while others (""Blues like midnight"") derive 100% from the Lefty Frizzell versions. The neo-western swing that is often associated with Haggard is intact on many of these songs, too.This album, while not Merle's greatest or bluesiest, is a good one to see where his style was born out of. This album is, in effect, the bridge between Lefty Frizzell and the later Merle Haggard style."
3,Ukraine flag,"It shipped quickly and was of good quality. The only problem...it was not the ""official"" flag of the Ukraine. It had an added symbol on it that is common there, but NOT a part of the official flag. Wish I had known that; I would have ordered a different one."
5,Highly Recommend,Love this book! I searched high and low for a book that would allow me to put all the details I wanted to know about myself as a kid. It's adaptable by simply placing a picture or label over any title that doesn't work. When my son reads this when he is older he will appeciate it so much.
3,Liked the lay-out and format,I like the layout and format of this book. However I wished it had a page for birthparent info and stats from Dr. appointments.
4,Author of Waiting for You: An Heirloom Adoption Journal,"Parents of adult adopted children will treasure this book to record their past. Parents of infant adopted children will enjoy using this book to record their present and future. It is well made and colorful. It has places for the mother and father to use. This would not be a great fit for single adoptive parents or alternative families, however. The book highlights and documents the child's years growing up. This keepsake is sure to be a labor of love. What a beautiful book."
4,Great to have a baby book for adoption...,"I really like this book. Even though not everything pertains to my child, it is nice being able to have a place to put all of his ""Firsts.""I don't mind that it focuses only on us, his adopted family. I have a special ""LifeBook"" which I created that tells him all about his birth family, including pictures and focuses on them. I think it is great for him to know that he has two families that love him! I also think that it separates everything so that it is not so overwhelming right now, while he is young.If you want a great way to share your child's birthfamily information, I would highly recommend buying ""LifeBooks Creating a Treasure for the Adopted Child"" by Beth O'Malley, MEd. It is a great help in not only creating a LifeBook, but also gives you ideas on how to explain to your child difficult things about his/her adoption."
5,"Excellent book, but purchase it from alternative site","This is an excellent book. But I suggest do not buy at from Amazon site from these sellers at an exhorbitant price. Buy it from any Indian online booksellers website (for eg. Indiaplaza.in, flopkart.com). Base price is around USD 10 and courier may not cost you more than USD25 max. EVen then it will cost you only USD 35."
5,Very good,This book had inspired and motivated me alot. I had read this. I bought this for my sister. SHe loved it too.
5,It's pretty neat!,I really like this rice cooker. I used to have 1 Panasonic and Aroma. Panasonic one was all right but didn't have a timer or variety of options to cook rice other than white rice. I feel this price is very reasonable and the size if paerfect for a small family.
4,Jasmine rice eaters,"I would rate this with a 5 star if the rice came out a little more moist; I usually just add a little more water for our tastes. We usually use white jasmine rice and it comes out definitely more dry than we prefer. But, the rice cooker is easy to use and clean and I use the timer function frequently. It's very portable, making it great for potlucks & picnics."
5,A very good product; manual is confusing,"So far the Rice Cooker has been performing wonderfully. Definitely not a bad investment: includes all of the possible basic options that make a good Rice Cooker and is priced reasonably. The instruction manual, however, was organized badly and I found it confusing and vague."
1,no part replacement,"note that sanyo discontinue all ""Inner pot"" part for this product (and the same goes for most of their other rice cookers). you won't find a new inner pot anywhere even if u go to their authorized part dealer, which means that if u would to buy this product now, you would be stuck with replacing a perfecting fine working rice cooker couple years down the road just because you have a scratched inner pot."
4,Rice Cooker,"I gave it 4 stars because there's a glitch in the timer. Other than that, the cooker is great. Makes excellent brown and white rice."
4,Second one owned and happy with it,"We purchased the Sanyo rice cooker when it first came out because of the titanium rice pot. Having used it frequently we eventually wore it out, so to speak, therefore the need to purchase the newest model.Very happy with it. Have used it several times now and the rice does come out great each time."
1,Great if you like the your rice undercooked in 90 minutes,"I bought this as a gift for my live-in boyfriend since he's been wanting a good rice cooker for a while. Even though my old electric rice cooker always had a bit of rice stick to the bottom of it, it was faster and came out better. The measuring markers on the inner pan are completely useless and must have been designed by either a complete genius (who cannot explain things simply) or a complete moron (who can't explain things at all). Ditto for the instruction manual. The brown rice setting takes at least 90 minutes, which is far longer than the 20 minutes of my pressure cooker. Even at 90 minutes, the rice is very chewy and tastes like it needed to cook for another half hour. Even the white rice I've cooked in it comes out tasting woody, and I've tried different grains from basmati to jasmine."
2,Don't do it...,"I bought this rice cooker thinking that I would take a step up in quality. It looks nice, it has a thick titanium coated, nonstick bowl, a carry handle, and a retractable cord. These are all nice features. However, how do you explain to your friends that you bought a $100 rice cooker that only makes good rice if you have mastered the art of figuring out how much water to add, and that takes twice as long to cook, 40 min! It took me over a year but I finally gave it up and went and got a cheap cooker that makes the rice great every time in half the amount of time."
2,Not as described,"I purchased this rice cooker after much research and thought this would be a good choice to make brown rice and pooridge.The description did not tell me that this rice cooker was manufactured in China.The interior is a non-stick surface.After many issues with toys, dog food and other items that are made in China I really did not want to bring an item in my home that food is prepared for my family that could possibly not be healthy for my family.When we recieved it I returned it right away.I wish Amazon would tell you where the item you are purchasing is manufactured."
2,Returned it.,Too big. Looked like a cleaning mess. Arrived after Christmas. Husband bought a little red Rival product from Target to put under the tree. Rice cooking is hard in Colorado. The Rival works really well for us. Looks good on the kitchen counter. Easy to clean. Took some trial and error but we get consistent rice at altitude now. Steamer basket does well with vegetables and shrimp while the rice is cooking.Pretty unhappy about what it cost to return the Sanyo. Not worth it unless you are cooking for a lot of people.
5,Reliable Rice Cooker,"I've had mine for 2 months now and have only used it to cook white rice. In general, it takes about 40+ minutes to cook 2 cups of rice. I don't think there is much room for improvement as my previous Fujitsu digital rice cooks took even longer. The rice comes out just the way I wanted it (consistently).I also like the inner lid, which is easy to remove and clean. You'll still need to wipe the outer lid clean, but it is very easy to do. Overall, I think this is a great rice cooker for the price you pay. I'm going to explore cooking brown rice and porridge later."
4,Blues-rock with a few psych tracks thrown in,"This 1969 album is a competent collection of mostly blues-based songs that is pleasant enough to listen to, although it but doesn't offer that much to make it stand out from hundreds of similar contemporary releases. The non-blues and more psychedelic 'A Million Years', 'Memory Tree' and 'Night Flash' are exceptions worth mentioning, and here the band shines. 'Lady Linda' is a pretty acoustic track in the style of Crosby, Stills and Nash. Worth investigating if you like blues/blues-rock in the style of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, which is the style of the remaining 6 songs, although without a Clapton, Green or Taylor."
5,MASTERPIECE OF AMERICAN SOUL MUSIC,"Perfect reunion of good musics, good arrangements and good performances! All the musics are excellent, specially ""I'm going by the stars in your eyes"", the exotic version for ""Me and Mrs. Jones"" (of Billy Paul) and the AMAZING ""Me myself and I"" (a potential hit). Launched in 1975, I hear this album stil today ( I have the vinil record) and never get tired of hearing it..."
5,Gimme Some of that good soul music!,"The Dramatics are the best soul group of the 70s! This group will sweep you off your feet. This album, the Dramatic Jackpot, contains pure slices of sweet soul. When you listen to it, you will feel as if you have hit the jackpot. Unlike other groups, each member of the Dramatics can and did sing lead. All of them have strong voices and is able to lead any kind of song."
3,"if you work a cashier job, this book is for you",but it wasn't for me who used to be into math and is now trying to get back into it.I spent about a week to review every page. I can tell this book for sure is a collection of fun high school math reviews (or up to Prealgebra at community colleges?). the topics are not necessarily organized like it explains square root of X equals X^1/2 around page 360 but HAVEN'T WE USED THIS OVER AND OVER THROUGH THE BOOK?it's a book book and i like the cover but don't recommend it to anyone.
1,Not so dandy!,"The video portion of this DVD isn't bad, especially for those, like me, who are nostalgic for '70s rock. Unfortunately, the audio is horrible. I bought this mostly to watch/hear Tommy Aldridge on drums, but the audio includes almost no drum sound in the mix. You can hear the snare drum, but that's about it. The guitar jams come through pretty clearly, and the guitarists are great, but the lead vocals overwhelm everything else, and Jim Dandy sounded horrible. I'm new to the band, so I don't know if he was having an off night, or if this is how he's supposed to sound, but it was very difficult to listen to his ""vocals"" for the whole concert -- and it's only a little over a half an hour! One more thing: the cover of ""Taxman"" is so bad that by the end, you'll be rooting for the IRS. Only a major Black Oak Arkansas fan should consider buying this, and even then, it's questionable."
4,Good value for the money!,"I bought this cassette player because my two old ones no longer work, and I have cassettes I still play. I was surprised at the low price! It works quite well, but when playing at a low volume, the player itself makes a little noise that is not audible at higher volumes."
4,Pleasantly Pleased,"At first, I wasn't sure what to have expected. The cassette player/recorder works really great and its simple to use for what I needed it for."
2,Coby CX144 AM/FM Cassette player recorder,"The product is attractive and, to someone who is a generation behind in technology, feels good when I grab the handle and transport it. I'm sure there are far more portable and effective products on the market, but the very low price is the biggest plus here. One mistake I made was to assume ""recorder"" meant I could speak into it and it would record my voice. Not so. It has a way to internally create a tape from a radio show. I detect also that the speed at which it plays recirded cassettes is just a bit too fast. not enough for me to want to return it."
1,Dave559,"The radio arrived on time. I plugged it in. The volume was very low. At a distance of 6 feet you could not understand anything being played. I tried to tape a program but when played back there was no sound at all. I tried to play a prerecorded tape. It would not work either.I checked into returning it for exchange or refund but determined that it would not be cost effective once I packaged up the unit, took it to UPS and paid the freight. I threw the radio out and bought one that actually works."
2,Not what I wanted,I was looking for a cassette recorder that would record from an outside source. This only records from the built in radio.
2,You get what you pay for,"I really just wanted the function of being able to play a cassette, but, it chewed the tape I use to test it and I knew I couldn't try it again, but it does pick up some radio channels."
3,am/fm cassette,"For the price, it is a decent value. the sound is fair. The buttons are kinda cheap. I have seen better made cassette players for the same money.For the office it is fine. i still have alot of cassettes i like and it suits me fine for at work."
1,Thought I'd be different!,"I was looking for a cassette player for my daughter to use. I had read the reviews about this player eating cassettes and thought that maybe they were just really old cassettes. I bought this thinking maybe the one I bought wouldn't do that. I was wrong! The shipping was really quick, and it didn't eat the first one or two cassettes. The third one was the charm. I had to dig the tape out of the play reel. Then my daughter tried again and she managed to get one or two through sucessfully but again it ate another cassette! I am really annoyed that it ate the tapes and now they will never play consistently again. So if you are like me and you check the reviews. Believe me it will eat your tapes!!!! Don't buy it!!!!!!!!"
1,corny colby,i read all the options many times for the colby radios offered. the options state for the model i purchased that it has an external microphone and that you can record with it. the radio has no such option and you can only record from the radio. now iam stuck with it. it will cost me more to send it back than what the radio is worth IAM NOT HAPPY AT ALL
3,it's ok but . .,"For the money, not bad, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired. When I read the other reviews, I thought this would be perfect for my needs. I have a lot of cassette tapes that I've had for years and wanted a way to play them, but the sound quality, which can't be adjusted, is just not there. And after a few days of not using it, I realized that it really doesn't ever turn off when you're not using it, but goes into a sleep mode and still uses power because it started buzzing loud enough to be heard. This would be great to take to the pool or beach (battery source is there), but not for use around the house if you're into sound quality from those old cassettes that make you smile. I'm looking for something better."
1,Piece of junk,"Got it 8 days ago, only played it once a day, it ate 2 tapes in a row. Do not buy this model!!!!!!"
5,Better than described,This item was sooooo much better than described! Received excellent reception we have don't even have to put up the antenna.
2,not so good,"Product description does not clearly indicate that it cannot voice record. That is the main use I got it for. Radio works OK, cassette, so-so. For voice/music recording,these type products appear to be being replaced by I-pod type gadgets-I later got & use a Nano, but if I could get a good, inexpensive cassette recorder to use, I might still be using it since the simplicity of use is easier & the learning curve to learn to use is less."
1,not worth the money,"I purchased this so I could listen to my audio books on tape, while I am at work. I like that it is small and portable.The background noise is AWFUL!!!!!I tried different locations on my desk and even different outlets, thinking the computer was causing some of the noise. It makes no difference.I am listening to Pride and Prejudice right now, and the background 'static' is louder than the narrator!!I wish I could return it!!!"
1,Wrecked All My Tapes,"When trying to play tapes in this player it destroyed the tape and we had to rewind the tape if even that was possible. We gave it plenty of tries, but unfortunately it demolished a book on tape from the library even. With that particular tape it cut through the tape. I was very disappointed and angered at this. What I thought to be a brilliant Father's Day present turned out to be a disaster."
2,don't bother,"I bought this player to play old cassettes. On every one it ""dragged"" like it was worn out even though it was new. Radio works ok. But.....don't bother."
1,Lasted four months...,Started chewing up tapes at the end of August after purchasing in in April. Of course the buttons popped off weeks before that. Now I'm looking for another one but it won't be from Coby. Don't buy!!!
1,Not Quite as Advertised,"This cassette recorder records only from its radio, not from any outside source -- no mic or mic jack. The product description implies otherwise."
1,no good product,"i never purchase this product, also nobody referred never ever . when its use this tape is not work.I am not satisfy"
2,Coby cx 144,"As of 6/11/08 am on my sixth one of these gems, three of which had to be returned to the Alco store where they were purchased. One would not work on house current. Another buzzed heavily on a.c., giving off an odor of melting plastic. The one exchanged 6/11? The cassette portion went dead-wouldnt rewind, play or record. When these work, the quality is okay, and it is hard to buy a unit like this without an obtrusive cd player. It is too bad these are so unreliable."
1,coby cx-144,Started chewing up my tapes within 1 week. It's hard to get a tape player any more. Shipping charges plus the cost of the product added up to wasted money--
