3,3 stars,"Emma Lachance's plans for a new life come crashing down when her friend is found murdered in a most gruesome manner at a construction site. Instead of divorcing her abusive husband, her focus shifts to dealing with the other woman's death and the sudden reentry of Finn Duhan, her old flame, into her life. For much of the book, Emma simply copes, then there is another death, and another. All the victims are members of a support group, one Emma belongs to, and so she is a probable next victim, unless Finn can find and stop the killer.*** Until the last quarter of the book, the pacing is rather slow and meandering. Emma is a frustrating heroine. You wish she would do something about her bad marriage sooner. There is an action filled ending, but the killer is fairly easy to spot early on. ***Amanda Killgore"
2,Forgettable,"This book is so forgettable, I've already forgotten the plot, and pretty much everything about the book. It just doesn't stand out from the pack of ""romantic suspense"" novels out there - a generic, by-the-guidelines text, there is no reason to bother reading it because it is just like any other book of its type out there. Save your time for a better novel."
2,This can't be written by Stella Cameron,The writing in this book is unbelievable. At times it makes absolutely no sense. The actions of Emma and Finn are ridiculous. I read all the wonderful books by S. Cameron but the quality of her work certainly has depreciated. I thought this book which was suppose to be a suspense rather silly.
2,If you have nothing better to do,"If you have a lot of time to waste this book is worth a read just to see how bad a book can be. Other then that if your looking for a good book this simply isn't it.This is the first book I read by Stella Cameron, and I probably won't ever buy another one. The back seemed interesting enough.For one the first murder drags on and on and on with not much happening other then sorted silly affairs that don't make much sense at all. If the author intended to build a character background she failed. IF she was trying to make it look like there were possible other murders she failed. The 2nd murder in the book was absolutely pointless.The ending was horrible, it didn't make any sense even one of the characters ask well how did ""the murder"" try to drive you insane. The author simply had a lot of thoughts but could or choose not to finish them."
5,"Great service, great product!","The book was in excellent condition, like new, just as the seller said. I was thoroughly pleased."
2,Sentimental slush,"I downloaded this book under the mistaken impression that it was a history of the Scottish clan system, based solely on its title. (My own fault - I should have read the other reviews, rather than just going by the star rating). Instead I found it was a historical romantic novel, loosely based on the life of Sir William Wallace. The book contains little actual historical detail, and what there is does not seem to be very reliable. As a novel I found it tediously slow moving and padded with an excess of sentimental slush. However, I must confess that I gave up after 4 or 5 chapters, so maybe it improves. Written in 1810, the book may be of interest to a student of early 19th century literature, but modern readers seeking historical detail or even just a rip-roaring yarn will be disappointed. However, as the other reviews indicate, the book clearly appeals to devotees of a specific genre. However, it was not my cup of tea."
3,A Work of Fiction,"This book is a novel, written in Victorian times by a Victorian lady. It has virtually no actual history in it and is, as has been pointed out, very wordy and full of emotional claptrap. If you like that sort of thing then this is the book for you. Othewise look for a non-fiction piece."
5,A wonderful book!!!!!,This book is one of my childhood favorites. The adventure and drama of Sir William Wallace's life is one of the reasons why I still love to read classic literature. I recommend this book for all age groups
4,Great Family History,"A great history book for those that can identify with these noble Scots, and want to know what really happened to people like Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, and Sir William Wallace."
4,Good book,Not the easiest reading due to the fact that it's a near copy of the original edition which was written in 1810. But it is a captivating story and worth your time and money. Very inspiring for a committed and dedicated life filled with passion for the calling that is yours!
5,"Honor, dignity, morality, and other forgotten traits.",A book that you will enjoy for the emotions that it will evoke
4,Early Scottish Life,"I read this book hoping to get an understanding of the times of Wm Wallace. Although I enjoyed reading it, I was a bit disappointed in that the story written was more of a romantic version than what I was expecting."
4,what a name,Theree is something about the dirt smell that is taboo. When you first spray this its comes off as freshly dug dirt in the backyard. It doesnt project well on my skin after about 5 minutes it moves closer to the skin. In the cool down stage it becomes a pleasant scent. This fragrance isnt for everyone its more of a novelty item.
1,Stinks!,"This stuff really stinks. I guess I was foolish to order this. I just wanted to try something different. When my Siamese cat smelled it on me, he became very excited and lifted his tail. My only thought was that he must have been reminded of the wet dirt outside where he does his business. All in all, an interesting experience."
2,pass,sucked into buying another CD because the blurb made it sound so good. If they had kept it instrumental it would have been good. The singing is flat and colorless and wavery. No variety in rhythms and tone. Save your money. Lee
1,runs large,I bought this as a gift and it was too big. so order a size smaller. I also was disapointed that they didnt refund me all my money. I paid to send it back and all they credited me was 28.00. I would not order from them again.
5,Warm and foldable,"It's not for me but for a friend who appreciates the simplicity and comfort of this hat. It comes in XXL, is warm for the winter, and folds for storage into a coat pocket. Lots of colors available, but we like the muted ones."
5,Kangol 504 cap,"I really like the cap, the sizing info helped and it's a perfect fit. The color was not quite what the photograph on the web site looks like, it is more green/loden than the gray-ish/green and for me that is a plus. The wool is warm but breathes well so even wearing it indoors is not a problem - at least for the cooler months. The wool is soft and not at all scratchy/itchy, after about 20 minutes you don't even know you're wearing it.My only wish is that the cap was made somewhere other than China - it's well made and all but still..."
5,Perfect,Exact;y what I was looking for. The size was right as was the color and material would do it again
3,The color is way off,"I bought this hat as a gift, so I can't review how it fits, but the color ""flannel"" is MUCH darker in person than the photo shows it to be. It is too late to exchange for something else for Xmas, so hopefully it isn't just like the dark grey one he already has. :-("
2,Get your colors straight,"I have now ordered three Kangol caps (and returned two) because it's impossible to tell what color these items are online. What color--pray tell, is ""Storm"" (actually blue)? Online, it looks gray. What color is ""Amazon"" (actually green)? Online, it looks gray. There is no cap marked ""gray,"" which is the color most people wear."
2,No lining,In Chicago the winters are cold. This hat is wool but has no lining. The cap I did buy does have one.
1,This must be a knock off,"This must be a knock off, the printing inside the hat is coming off on my head! don't buy it."
5,"Kangol Men's Wool 504 Cap, Camel",Got this for my husband as a Christmas gift and he loved it - says it keeps his head warm on those windy cold days. Kangol proves again it produces quality products. Definitely recommend !
4,Hats off to you,"Fast delivery, good quality, great fit. Disappointed that, though it is an English style hat, it was made in China. Would be nice if that was noted in the text."
1,Kangol Hat,"This was a very disappointing purchase. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and when we opened the box, we were surprised to see a bright yellow hat. The picture was very deceiving.The picture is more mellow in color. So proceed with caution when ordering."
1,"ITCHY- NOT WOOL - ELASTIC HEADBAND - Kangol,youv'e changed for the worse","I like my summer kangol cap, thought i would try one of they're wool caps. Well, I couldn't be more let down. First, it's not wool-it's a funky-itchy heavy fleece material w/ elastic headband. This is not a $40 cap, not worth a penny over $10, if i had seen it - i would not even considered it, it's a joke. It's a rip-off, I'm done with Kangol- they're not the same since 2011."
3,Not quite up to par for price,"The cap had a small round indentation in the center. It was also wrikled. I was told by the seller that it would be fine once I wore it. At the price, I chose to return it."
3,round like a beret,"I ordered this and the 507. I'm returning this one and keeping the 507.The 504 shape is quite round, with the brim extending a couple inches in front of the forehead, but also out from the temples. I think it might work better for an older person.The 507 is a slightly younger, hipper shape."
5,good looking hat,"I bought this hat for my son in law for Christmas and it was the wrong size. The company exchanged it for a different size, no questions asked and very quickly too. He loves it. It is very well made and warm too."
5,Great Product,"Good quality material and very well made, I would recommend this product to any one who loves a well made cap."
5,Great,"Better than the one I previously owned (and lost). If I need to order more, I will do so from this site."
4,Con't like the logo in the cap,"I bought my first kangol 25 years ago, the same blue one. The only thing I don't like about this new cap is the logo, the old one did not have it."
3,For Very Wide Heads & Faces,"This is a nicely made cap. The wool is extremely soft, and the colors are rich and vibrant. However, the shape is much wider than most traditional caps of this type (whatever you may choose to call them - Scally caps, Ivy caps, flat caps, driving caps, etc.). If you have a very wide head and face, this cap will look great. If you have a narrow face, it will look rather silly - a little like a beret with a visor sewn in. For point of reference, if you have a head like James Gandolfini or Kevin James, get the 504. If you have a narrower facial profile (think Paul Newman, Adrien Brody, etc.), consider the Kangol Geez. It has a more traditional shape that doesn't look so wide and pancake like on a thinner face."
5,famous label,Excellent cap from Kangol--Designed in England but manufactured as most items these days in Asia--Fortunately it seems to be made properly and sized as indicated--Service from the dealer was above and beyond expectations--Prompt delivery--Two days from East Coast toWest Coast.
3,"Kangol 504, Not like they used to be","Ordered this hat in a size L to replace one I purchased about twelve years ago. Honestly the new one does not seem to be near as nice in terms of quality. The material (wool) just doesn't seem to be as high quality. Maybe its just me. Additionally, the size L is just too large. The hat fits much to loosely on my head, so much so that I probably won't wear it much if at all. I don't know if outsourcing and quality control are the problem here, but unfortunately I suspect that is the case. I'll rate it 3 stars instead of 2 only because I liked the previous one so much and hope that I just got a lemon this time. Not too upset though; it's only a hat."
2,poor value for the price,Not woven wool like Kangol hats I've owned in the past. Quite frankly it just looks like it was cut from a cheap surplus wool blanket. Guess I'll just use my old worn out woven Kangol hat.
2,i dont like it,"Color seems wrong, does not quite resemble the young people with the work in general, the general shape ..............Some thin"
4,color much darker than pictured,"color is so much darker than pictured, that we thought the incorrect hat had been sent. we returned it twice before realizing it is almost the exact same color as the ""dark flannel"" or dark grey cap. the QUALITY however is excellent. only the color is the problem when ordering."
5,Awesome Zippo lighter as always,"Very awesome lighter. Really dig the brushed finished, hate the fingerprints left behind on high polished Zippos. I didn't look close enough when ordering that the lighter piece you pull out is also all gold too. Everyone should have a Zippo!"
5,Gold lighter,"I recently sold a 1964 14K gold lighter that I bought from a co-worker in Tucson, AZ in 2003. The lighter had belonged to Sammy Davis Jr. It was a very intersting story how the ex-navy veteran acquired the lighter. I sold it to the ""Pawn Stars"" guys in Vegas, and immediately bought an awesome leather massage chair with the cash. However, I really missed the feel of the solid gold lighter.I saw this one on Amazon for under $15 including shipping. It is great!! The service is very fast. I bought a second one. Not real gold, but it is close enough!"
4,edith sitwell holler,"An overall excellent album. Tim Curry has a very good rock 'n' roll voice, and the song I Do the Rock is brilliant, literary, and very funny. Worth the price of admission and the other songs are very good too."
5,Excellent,This is a wonderful book that is chocked full of encouragement and useful insight on how to change for the better. I definitely recommend it!
1,The greedy man curses and spurns God,"Ps. 10:3 - ""the greedy man curses and spurns God""Rick Warren has sold 40 million books in the past thirteen years. The average price for a book is $19.95. Most authors get a 15 percent royalty on the books they write (authors of Warren's success may well get a higher percentage, but we'll be conservative here). All this means that Warren has sold $798 million worth of books. Warren's take--15% of $798 million--is $119,700,000. So even if Warren ""tithed"" 90% of his income, he still kept $11,970,000 for his own personal use. That is more money than most people will make in their lives. And it is certainly not what Jesus did."
4,Be Bop Deluxe and Jan please come home,After trying to shed the source of two great sorrows and joys in his life (Be Bop Deluxe and Jan) Bill now attempts to resurrect and deal with these past ghosts. Intended for a new and improved Be Bop Deluxe line-up the songs still addresses his break up with his ex-wife Jan. Jan has been and will remain a constant theme for Bill well into the 90's. The music is a high quality demo intended for the new line-up. Though Be Bop Deluxe and Jan never re-emerge into Bill's life the music is still very good.
2,Another weak album by Bill,I keep looking for another BeBopDelux album from Bill and he keeps disappointing me. I'll give up on his solo albums at this point.
4,Great Emotional Music,"So there I was in a Munich gasthaus, nursing a very bad Oktoberfest ""flu"". A Turkish guy working the bar is putting on cassette tapes, and he puts one on that has me mesmerized. I ask him what it is, and he has no idea. The tape had no markings on it. I looked for the music for a couple years, and finally heard ""Am I blue for You"" and knew that I had found it. This LP needs to be made into a readily available CD. This is a great album, with several very good songs."
4,Joan did it again,"I like this album. Not as soft as previous albums, ot was funkier and sharper. To the limit is one of my favourite joan songs. Really a joy to listen to."
5,Beautiful Music!,"A wonderful CD of Scandinavian Christmas music, it is a joy to listen to. This is a treasured addition to my large collection of music of all genres from all over the world. When it arrived I listened to it several times, enjoying the music each and every time."
3,"Descriptive information, but the book is outdated and biased...","This book may be is descriptive and detailed in some aspects, but it's outdated and some of the schools that are so-called ""the best in NYC"" have taken a turn for the worst and shouldn't even be on that list--even back then. I mean really. My jaw dropped when I saw the ""best high schools"" in each borough. The authors of this book seem to favor small high schools as well. The book also skips a lot of good high schools in NYC, like John Dewey High School. Smaller schools, for the most part, do not produce significantly higher results than a large school. Well, I hope a new book that really digs in to the bone on each high school in NYC is published soon."
2,Slippery,These sheets are not as good as it looks in the picture. These are very slippery and it takes lot of effort to hold them on to your body. It simply slips away. I don't recommend these sheets.
3,THE PURPLE ONES ARE JUST FINE!,"I wasn't expecting much for the price, but hubby has been asking for satin sheets so purchased them as extra birthday gift to prove to him that satin sheets are no big deal. You can slide right out of bed...you can't sit at the edge while dressing, same problem...and it's difficult to keep the blankets in place. But once they arrived, I was amazed at how soft they are and since we now have a king size bed I no longer sleep near the edge of the bed, so haven't landed on the floor yet . However, our large dog, ""PUPPY LOVE"" jumped on with his huge new rawhide bone, and he and both velour covers went flying. Where else can you find so much fun for $29.99. Well, the week is up and I know they'll look like hell after washing, but so far can't fault the look or feel. Maybe PURPLE was the only way to go! Frankly I came back to site to try & get them in Emerald Green so I can mix the colors together...my present to me!"
2,Sheet set,It looks really good in the picture. But its very average Sheet. Not good. I didn't like it.
5,Great inexpensive Satin Sheets!,"If you have always wanted to try Satin Sheets like my husband and I have you have got to grab a set of these. No they are not the finest satin sheets you will ever buy becasue they are only $30, well we paid $20 at the time. So don't expect perfection here like others who are expecting the world out of $30 sheets:)Do wash them when you get them in softnener to add a nice scent and then enjoy! My husband woke the next morning and said, ""I love these sheets, and the pillowcase doesn't make my head hot like other pillowcases do."" He didn't even want to get out of bed:) So, these are winners in our house and since they are so cheap we will get a couple more sets in some different colors. So go ahead and buy them, its worth it; and if you hate them its only $30 you'll forget you spent anyway!"
2,Satin Sheets,"Not a real quality product, but I wasn't expecting much. Good buy if you want to just try them out, but if you want lasting quality, look elsewhere."
2,Didn't hold up,The sheets were great until you washed them I washed on the gentle cycle and still had stitches falling out
1,Read that as a NO star for the rating - DO NOT BUY!,"Really thin, flimsy finish - looks cheap. DO NOT BUY. I cant believe I have to pay for shipping this junk back. Amazon should make quality an issue and make the manufacturer pay for returns..."
2,Had real issues with snagging,"The issue with these sheets may or may not be common to all satin sheets - I just don't know. In any event, these sheets snagged on everything. If my fingernail was not perfect, it got caught. The rough skin on the bottoms of my feet would snag. I had to wear socks to keep the sheets from catching on me. My wife, who takes great care of her nails and feet, also had the same issues (mostly with fingernails). In the end, we had them in use for 5 days before giving up on them. I wish I could say if this has anything to do with the quality of this set or with the fabric in general. I can say I have bought many things from Amazon and online from various places, and this is the first time I have made the effort to offer negative feedback for others."
2,My first returned item,"I've never previously had to return anything I bought from amazon, but these sheets are just not what they are advertised to be. polyester, not satin. Very rough to the touch. I wanted satin sheets, so I just returned them."
3,Cheesy and corny or Luxurious and Fun?,"Hmmm... For the price I can't really complain, but I've definitely slept on better. I can't help but feel circa 1989 though when I'm laying on them."
4,"People need to understand what ""Satin"" means","This is a very good deal for the money. I have ordered similar sheets from Amazon and am very pleased. However, the previous users who commented that this isn't satin need to get a dictionary or an encyclopedia. The term Satin primarily refers to the weave of a cloth. There IS such a thing as Polyester satin. You are NOT being deceived."
2,well...they were cheap,"Yeah, nothing great about these sheets. After relatively light use and hand-washing, they are pilling up like crazy and they're so see-through that I'm sure they'll start to rip in no time. Cheap & they worked for a while, but I would not buy these again."
3,bike cover,"after using it twice i decide that would make a good motorcicle cover, i find that is very slippery, loose few times the pillows and the sheet was always on the floor"
3,Satin Sheets,"Very pleased thus far with the sheets, though I just got them. Fit my bed perfectly. Have yet to wash them, but hope they will become a bit more smooth & soft than the initial out-of-the-box stiffness."
3,"Not the best, but a great price","These sheets are soft and smooth, and seem to hold up pretty well. They're not the best sheets I've slept on, but then they were a bargain here anyway. One thing: make sure you wash them separately, at least the first time. They leaked a lot of dye the first time through the laundry cycle."
3,Too slippery,"It slips very fast and you are not able to hold it properly, Not goo din winters as it doesn't protects you very well from cold."
1,You get what you pay for!,"Low quality, tear very easily. One time on the bed and they practically fall apart."
1,Luxurious... HAHAHAHA! DO NOT BUY!!!,"These are SO Cheap! You do not want them! Run Away, Lol! I thought they would be nice because they look so pretty in the picture... but they are NOT! They feel like a slip in slide or something... almost like plastic! Maybe I am not used to these kind of sheets but that is the LEAST of my complaint! I put them through the washer on delicate and after just one wash... the pillowcase have lost ALL shine! They look dull and nasty and the sheet set is all blotchy with dull spots! SAVE YOUR MONEY and don't even look at these! I was lured in with the cheap price... I believe I paid $19.99 for Queen Size. If I could rate these less then 1 Star I would!!"
5,I Love These Sheets!,I was very impressed with the product. The shipping took no time at all. The sheets feel very nice to the skin. I was also impressed with how well they were made to fit my king size mattress.
2,"Disappointing Quality, you get what you pay for.","I was very disappointed with these sheets. They are anything but ""Luxurious"". They are 100% Polyester Satin and they are extremely low quality, rather than being smooth and silky, they are thin, poorly made and only slightly shiny and smooth. If you rub your hand the wrong way across them they are somewhat scratchy and rough. I wouldn't recommend purchasing them at even the discounted price. Save your money and wait for a deal on some high quality satin sheets."
2,Polyster sheets... YUCK!,"Sleeping in polyester is like sleeping in plastic bags. The fabric isn't natural, so it doesn't breathe. If you like that sort of thing, these sheets are fine, I guess, but beware if you've got sensetive skin, like me; these sheets will make you Break Out!"
3,"wash in delicate, these are thin, weak, cannot take real washing","They come out of the package a bit too plastic-like. They need to be washed before use in a very cold water delicate wash using very little soap. Do not dare put these in a normal wash with normal soap, they will not survive. Treat them as if they are old and fragile. These are adequate sheets, not super thick and definately not real fabric. They are like a thin layer of polyester jacket lining. Fine for a special occasion, but too weak for everyday use."
1,Too bad there isnt a no star rating,"These things are so thin you can see through them. Very, very poor quality. After washing there are even thinner streaks throughout, they arent going to last long."
2,slippery sheets,"Way too slippery for me, I find the sheets are always off the bed in the morning and I am always trying to arrange them to stay in place."
2,poor fit,When i order these satin sheets they look good until i put them on my bed there very stiff and there to big for a queen sizebed. they come off the bed very easy. pooly made.
4,don't need sheeps,"This sheets are great, at first I found my bed a little cold, but after one minute the sheets are really tempted. They look good and feel great."
1,Horable,These sheets were horable they were ruff and not at all the satin I like I got a robe from amazon same fabric and the robe was so much softer and silky so I dont recommend this item I would return it but dont have the money to return it.
2,Slippery!,"Low quality - I guess it's a lower price so I should have expected it, but it's very uncomfortable and slippery. Looks not bad but if you're gonna sleep on it, I'd recommend spending a few more bucks and getting some non-satin ones!"
3,Don't Know,"When I ordered the sheets I was looking for regular king size sheets, but recieved california king insted, so I can't give a very good review, I haven't even opened the package cause they wont work for me, but they look nice, I reorded and got the correct size and the sheets that I got are really nice they were the gold set, same brand. And I love those. I only gave a 3 star cause I don't know anything about these ones but on my other review I gave a 5 star."
3,Exactly what I paid for......,"These sheets are fine for the price. The pillowcases are only tacked over at the hem, not sewn all the way around...which is a little annoying, but overall, they are fine. I bought them for my eight year old daughter(go figure) to go with her zebra bedspread.....she loves slipping and sliding all over them...and they definitely do keep her hair from getting completely tangled while she tosses and turns...Certainly not luxurious, but you could do worse...."
4,I love them,"These are the best thing I ever did for myself! They were really scratchy when I got them out of the packaging so I was skeptical. After washing them 3 or 4 times though, they became awesome! They are super soft and they keep me cool at night. I would order them again!"
1,A Rip-Off at any price.,I was attracted by the good price. These sheets have holes and rips after a single week of use. There is no price low enough to accommodate that.
2,Iffy quality,"They are slick, but satin sheets are supposed to be slick.The flat sheet is only comfortable on one side, and the finishquality is iffy. One pillowcase seam came completely undonethe first time it was on a pillow.So they're nice, but not luxurious, and not very well made."
1,Buy at your own risk,"While I realize you (the buyer) are going to do what you feel best, a word of caution: these sheets are not what you think them to be. I read all the reviews here and made up my own mind to buy them. I'm in the process of returning them as we speak.They are rough and look uncomfortable. That may not tell you much since each person has their own opinion of what that may be, but I can be comfortable sleeping on the floor or a bed filled with down feathers. I refuse to sleep on these sheets.I hope you use more sense than I did when considering these sheets."
1,Sub-par performance,"The fabric pills, the look is fairly cheap, and I just gave ours away to the Salvation Army. Spend a little more and don't bother with sets of fewer than 300 thread count."
1,wasn't as described,"While the sheets weren't luxurious as described and did I agree w/the other reviewers that they felt more like ""plastic"" than satin; more importantly, these queen sized sheets did not fit my queen sized matress! Since I'd already opened the package and tried hard to make them fit--one corner got pulled--I wasn't in a position to return them. I think. I wish I'd stuck w/just the champagne pillow case covers which were silky-feeling and fit my standards like a glove. Very disappointed in the manufacturer of the above sheets and wish Amazon would drop this company as a featured seller!"
2,I wouldn't call them Luxurious...,I was very disappointed in these sheets. These were my first experience with satin sheets and I can truly say that I won't do it again. They are rough and stiff. Save your $$$$.
2,Tricky Product Name,"These are played up in the title and description as Satin Sheets. They are not they are polyester, which is a detail buried in the minor details of the product. Satin is Satin, polyester is polyester, don't get tricked like I did."
3,A decent one,"I think this item is good for the price I paid. It is one of those things,""what you pay is what you get""."
4,Great sheets for good price,"Very happy and satisfied with these sateen sheets, I love the slippery feel. I rated it 4 stars as they were not as soft and smooth like my earlier sateen sheets (which were from India) and the queen size is little bigger for my queen size bed. I was told sateen gets too hot for summer...infact I find them cool in summer and cozy in winters. Overall...Great sheets for this price."
1,"Horrible sheet set, feels like sleeping on a thick plastic material",Feels like sleeping on plastic!!! Dont BUY IT
4,slipery satin,"what a fun product. What?! you may ask, fun?, let me explain. Even though the set is now incomplete and broken it congers memories of sliding around, losing my pillows and falling off the bed. depending what jamies you wear or what you don't wear you may find yourself sliding after your pillow. if you roll around allot in your sleep be prepared for the ride of your life since this thing is slippery. I once gently jumped on the bed, landed on my pillow and slid off the other side of the bed. I could turn over in my sleep in one spot without moving anything after practice. Caution: If you buy this product make sure your bed is level. One star off for waking up without my pillow."
1,Not great at all,The sheets just arived and I am disappointed. They feel rough. The satin feels very coarse. I've used other satin sheets before and this is no match for them. I wouldn't suggest this item even at the current price.
2,"polyester, not satin",This is misleading. cheap polyester. good looking but feel like plastic. I agree with the first review
1,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT,"I have purchased these sheets twice already. I should have learned the first time not to reorder them again. The first set were for my son and I washed them with the other dark sheets. They came out with little balls all over the sheets. So, when I ordered another set for my daughter, I decided to wash them separately in cold water with woolite. They came out of the machine with small lines all over the sheets where you could see that within another few washings, they were sure to tear.I would not suggest these sheet sets to anyone unless you want to use them just once for a special occasion. They look beautiful when you remove them from the packaging and place them on the bed for the first time, but don't think you can wash them and have them maintain their beauty. I've tried twice and failed."
4,Needs better instructions,"Should have been an easy install but the instructions are very poor.Kit includes one special tool, instructions use two (one inch open end wrench will do fine for second tool).Kit includes one allen wrench, you need three sizes.On the bottom use the included allen wrench to remove the four screws that hold all the black parts to the gun.On the top, pull the bumper off. Remove four screws and top.Inside top remove three screws and and all the guts fall out.Use the included tool and 1 inch open end wrench to expose retaining pin holding driver.Install new driver, insert pin, use tool to cover it.Change the gasket between the upper and lower guts. Look close, the old gasket is in there don't miss it.Put the guts back in top and bottom and reconnect. (three screws)Top (four screws).Put back the bumper.Install the big black assembly on the bottom."
1,In The Future Ship What You Advertise,I purchased this item because the product description clearly states that what is being purchased is the entire floor nailer. This is also what is displayed under this product number in the Bostitch WEB site. What I received was only an adapter to adjust the nailer to 1/2' thick wood. (I got no tool and no mallet)
5,whoa....,"I don't know where to start,ok, so lets just make this easy for everyone, book is alot better than the movie. movie was great dont get me wrong, sadly there is a difference in the endings. both give off the same message though, so i guess that aint too bad. i actually saw he movie before reading the book. after having and entire day to myself reading page by page, i fell in love with this. ya sure im 17 so but this novel was not intended for young readers.JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ THIS BOOK!!!"
4,Book was better than the movie,Omni - History BeginsI liked the book above more than this graphic novel and the movie could have been better.
4,watchmen,"fun to read, lots of detail and grahics, it you like this type of story, it is one of the best."
4,Nerd Heaven,"This book is truly Nerdvana for comic-book fans. It deserves its lofty reputation because its so well-made & thoughtfully conceived. Lots of detail, so I imagine it'll stand up to repeated readings. I saw the movie 1st & I'm not sure if that was the correct order to do it in, but I liked them both so it worked for me."
5,buy it right now.,"everyone should read this at least 5 times in there life. i could not put it down. one of the most interesting, thought-provoking pieces of popular fiction i have ever had the privilege of reading."
4,Not what I expected.,"Not quite what I expected, but once I got into it I haven't been able to put it down. A very interesting concept."
4,Great to add to your collection,"This is a really cool and gritty series to add to your collection. Unfortunately mine came with a bent in corner on the case from shipping. I realize now i should have complained and asked for a new one, but at the time i was more excited to read it and didn't want to wait any longer."
5,The Superhero Comic to End All Superhero Comics,"This book was a very well-plotted, well-written, well-drawn comic. The characters are so rich and deep, they almost leap off of the page. The plot is complex but very well-done. Alan Moore managed to create an entire complex world with only about eleven issues, which is quite impressive. Probably the only thing I don't like about this comic is the break in the plot from the third or fourth issue and going on for about another three or four, where a comic inside a comic is introduced, I realized there were parallels in that story with the main plot but I found it unnecessary and having little to do with anything in the story, and it was pretty boring compared with the rest of the comic. Overall this was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who is either just curious about it or anyone who wants to read a well-done superhero comic."
5,Just a really well written book,"It deserves all the 5star reviews it has; it's very symbolic and every detail fits right into place. The characters are interesting and through various inserts at the end of each chapter you get a good glimpse into the whole universe created by Alan Moore in ""Watchmen"". It may not be positive, but it is thought-provoking. I liked it much more than the movie."
3,Dont Worry about not having read this,"Wow, Time Magazine 100 top novels. Basis for Major Movies. The work that changed a genre. I had to read this book. Well, after finishing I realize I really didn't have to read it. I figure this book is like Fried Chicken. If you have a passion for Fried Chicken you will attempt to elevate it to the level of fine dining. But sorry its just fried chicken full of grease and salt and thats what makes it good. you should be happy for whatever merit there is in that. This is a competent comic book for a mature audience. It has mediocre artwork, the characterizations are thin and often poorly reasoned. But gosh its got some gory violence, space monsters and even a competent love scene."
2,overrated glorified comic book,"What's all the fuss about? This may be a landmark among comic books, but as far as stories go it's pretty unremarkable--not to mention its 1980's cold war story is quite dated. Since most of the book is taken up by cartoonish drawings there's little room for things like character development or depth. If you like comic books, by all means pick this one up. But if you like reading novels don't bother."
2,Drama not Action,"I picked this up since there has always been a lot of hype about it in the gaming, comics and online world. It barely held my interest. It is a dark and gloomy story that is more melodrama than anything."
3,ehhhh....its alright,"I was first totally pumped to read this graphic novel because of the upcoming film of Watchmen. In the first chapter, I still thought it was great and it would pick up later, but I was wrong. The plot seems to drone on and on and on and on....well you get my point. I mean, who wants to see Dr. Manhattan having sex with his clones? Anyways, the movie looks way better than what this book is really about, yet something about the Watchmen makes it epic enough to bare...."
5,"Morally ambiguous, unambiguously excellent","Intricate and intelligent, Watchmen is an intense book. Replacing typical good vs. evil confrontations with moral ambiguity, Alan Moore writes a story questioning how superheroes can make the world a better place (fight crime? fight its causes? or turn away from fighting and invent things?) and how far they should go to do so. All this is wrapped in multiple plot lines examining different characters struggling to meet the various challenges placed before them while they move - unknowing or not - toward the book's central mystery. These different lines come together in an ending that, while surprising and imaginative, is still overshadowed by the power of the story being told. More dramatic novel than traditional comic book, reading the Watchmen is an amazing and absorbing experience."
3,Good but not great,"The plot and character development of the story is superb. So where does it go wrong? The story is too slow. While adding depth is great, there too many times where the dialogue runs on longer than needed. In addition, there are too many scenes that seemed longer than necessary. It's like one of those Hollywood epic films that badly needed to be trimmed. Aside from these flaws, you still have a good graphic novel with solid writing."
5,The best thing ever,I loved it. It gripped me and i just couldn't stop reading it. I was always suprised and the ending blew me away. Top!
5,True Literary Masterpiece,"Alan Moore's Watchmen is probably one of the greatest graphic novels I have ever read. Much like 300 or Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, Watchmen is able to provide emotional catharsis to the reader, something naysayers would say that the graphic novel is unable to do, and elevates the graphic novel into a true art form.I suggest Watchmen for people who liked 1984 and similar works, since it also deals with the issue of what someone is able to do with unlimited, unchecked power. I also suggest it for parents who liked watching The Incredibles with their children."
4,"Good Story, Great Ending","Thoroughly enjoyed the book, can't wait for the movie to come out. It isn't your traditional super hero story which threw me off a bit when I started, but by the end I couldn't put it down. I found the characters somewhat difficult to sympathize with in some parts, however there are those that really are appealing. Definitely check it out if you plan on seeing the movie."
4,Classic must read,"Although it's a bit dated, it's a classic. A must read for anyone who enjoys the graphic novel medium. Gritty, realistic, complex characters move the somewhat simplistic storyline forward. Considering it was written some 22 years ago, it's quite a classic. By todays standards I found it a bit thin."
4,BEST COMIC EVER!,"I do not generally read graphic comics, I tend to stick to fiction & non-fiction novels, but I was glad I picked this up after hearing all the pre-movie hype! It is a fantastic read with fantastic characters! It will be interesting to see how they pull it off on the big screen!!"
4,"Good, but overrated","Don't get me wrong. This is a very well written graphic novel. However, it was built up so much in my mind that I found myself somewhat disappointed in it.The ending is very anticlimactic, which hurts after such a long story.I wouldn't say that I couldn't put it down, by any means. In fact, some nights while reading this, I had a hard time picking it up.This is one of the better stories I've read, but I don't think I'd call it the best graphic novel of all time. Or, at the very least, it certainly isn't my favorite."
5,One of the best graphic novels ever,"I heard about Watchmen back in the 80's when I was still in middle school but was not able to obtain a copy, not many comic shop's back then, so when I realized Amazon was offering a copy I jumped at the oppertunity.This book lives up to all the hype I heard when I was younger, and since i was old enough to understand was was going on back then it was easy to remember all feeling's and emotion's of that decade. I love that Moore put in the ""villian reviles is plan to heroes"" cliche in the book with the twist that the heroes, armed with the information, were powerless to stop him. It's a good read, worth adding to any home library or graphic/comic book collection. Now I just have to wait and see how the movie does, can it live up to the book?"
5,awesome book,This was the first graphic novel i have read. I couldn't put it down. This graphic novel is full of detail. There's a movie coming out soon--so it might not be a bad idea to read it first. There's just so much to it!
4,Essential item.,"For any person interested in comics, Watchmen continues to be a reference. This book is a good option for those who wants to have the complete story without paying a lot for the original issues or the recent special editions."
5,A Moore Masterpiece,"Watchmen is an entertaining and complex comic collection. It is part mystery(some one is killing retired heroes) and part revised history(what would the world be like with super beings). The book covers around 15-20 years of history. From Vietnam to ""today."" There are great characters and the villain and his motives in the end are quite a surprise."
5,Classic Comic Writing (and good art too),"The Watchmen is a very detailed and deep work. The characters are very interesting, and realistic. The book also touches on many issues including nuclear war, homosexuality, rape, violence, love, and the meaning of life. Not bad for a comic book. Alan Moore is a very interesting person, and a great writer!"
3,"Before I could watch the movie, I had to read the book...","And I am glad that I did, although I wouldn't call it one of the 100 top best novels of all time.I have read comics and graphic novels before, the genre is not totally new to me, so the style didn't really affect my view of the book. I did find the novel confusing at points, with the main story being interupted by flashbacks and the ""reading"" of the Pirate comic. It did wrap itself up though nicely at the end and it all made sense.I thought the setting was precise, having grown up in Cool War years that the novel presents. I also like the Rorschach character (looking forward now to see how that works out in the movie).Maybe I had too much expectation for it, reading the critical reviews that are quoted on the back. It was a different read, I will give it that."
4,Great but... THAT ENDING!,"Yes, yes, wonderful, wonderful. It is a great character sketch with the standard Alan Moore complete disregard for normal time keeping. Really good.But the ending. The ending is unforgivable. I have worked this through I have no idea how many times and I do not think it possible to generate a worse ending. Those infinite number of monkeys and their typewriters and time are incapable of creating something this bad. Horrifyingly bad. Bad, bad, bad.Yet, on the whole, still good. Hmm."
4,"only ""comic book"" I have ever read","** spoiler alert ** I have never read a comic book in my life and was quite surprised that a ""graphic novel"" is in fact a big comic book. The first time I approached this book I was immediately put off by the style and had trouble ""getting into"" the unusual font. The second time I picked up this book (I had run out of reading material) I was able to get into the story and I'm very happy that I stuck with it.I saw the movie but I don't remember much of it. The book hearkens back to the 80s in an alternative history where Nixon is still president because the United States won the Vietnam War. The world is on the brink of nuclear war and it seems the entire population is doomed...I highly recommend this book to fans of science fiction, alternative history, etc. It was a rewarding read."
5,The Standard,"What can I say that hasn't been said already. This is the ""Hamlet"" of the comic book world. The ""Godfather"" of comics, if you will. The ""Moving Pictures"" of the comic book industry. What Moore and Gibbons have crafted here is a wonder unrivaled in the comics world. The sheer level of detail that they put into their work is astounding. Literally every single panel on every single page contains something important, some detail that if noticed, will make the reading experience that much more magical. I savored over this book for about two weeks before I finished it. It took me about two hours per chapter. This isn't the type of book that you can just breeze through, like many of today's comics. You will find yourself deeply drawn into this world and the lives of its characters. They will become like old friends to you. The mystery, the intrigue, the action...its all fantastic. You are in for a fantastic experience when you read The Watchmen."
5,A Great LIterary Work,"The Watchmen is one of the greatest works of graphic literature in all history. Dave Gibbons' artwork perfectly brings to life writer Alan Moore's (""From Hell"", ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and many other works) writings to life. Gibbons' style is highly realistic and the coloring is incredible.Each frame of art is a mini-masterpiece and helps add a visual dimension to Alan Moore's dark scrawlings.I bought Watchmen in its original monthly 12 issue format years ago. The super-heroes here are similar to 1930's Golden Age heroes, a bit campy and wooden. But Alan Moore heaps on the cynicism and darkness to update his heroes. One of the Watchmen is a rapist and war criminal. Another is a revenge obssessed predator, born to a prostitute and traumatized by a horrific murder of a child.Moore expertly explores the moral corruption that accompanies total power. Who watches the Watchmen?The movie version next year could be great."
4,Two dimensional images but three dimensional characters.,"Normally when I see or hear a lot of hype or hyperbole about something, I choose to ignore the subject, due to being disappointed too many times in the past.But with this product I'm glad I gave in and tried it.I've never read a graphic novel in which the characters are so well; ""fleshed out"" as these.I can recommend this award winning book to anyone who wouldn't normally pick up a graphic novel.(Special mention should go to colourist John Higgins.)Winner of the Hugo Award, and one of Time Magazine's 100 best novels.The Films due out next year, I hope they've done it right."
5,Awesome book,"This was an awesome book. I normally don't read many comics, but I enjoyed this one. Kudos to Alan Moore!(And, it's going to be a movie soon, I can't wait to see it!)"
5,Watchmen = Amazing,"Watchmen is much more than a graphic novel. It is a fantastically well crafted piece of literature. On top of the breathtaking imagery and top notch art work, the authorization is incredibly well done. I would highly suggest this book to any and everyone, whether they be a fan of comics or not. This book delves deeply into the many problems with today's society and hammers them out with such force it will leave you in slight disbelief afterward. You will finish this novel and want to immediately flip back to the front cover and start again, and you should. This book needs to be read a minimum two or three times to really grasp everything. Not to mention that it's better each time, because there are things there that you couldn't have possibly noticed the first time around. Read watchmen. Read it again and again."
4,First time comic reader left very happy. 4.5 Stars.,"This is the first time I've read anything even resembling a comic book, and I really liked it. I decided to read it because my dad, who is pretty picky with what he reads, read this book and loved it, so I decided to give it a try, and I'm very happy I did.Don't go into this expecting it to be a light reading, cheesy super hero comic. This is a very serious novel of staggering depth, with lots of psychological elements and well defined characters. A surprisingly deep read.My only real complaint about this novel is that some of the attempts at humor are a little dry. For example, in the first chapter, someone says something to Rorschach along the lines of ""You have friends now? I guess you changed your deodorant."" luckily there are only a few little things like that. All that aside, it's a great, unpredictable read. Highly recommended, even if you've never read a graphic novel."
5,Great Adventure in Reading,"The theme of this book varies greatly, but Moore does a fantastic job of pulling all of the story together at the end. Jon was a normal man created into a superhero from a science experiment gone wrong, and there are several really interesting elements throughout this book. It is a mystery of some sort that is eventually solved. Moore does a great job in not giving away the ending and keeping things interesting with his pictures, and even his figurative language. I would say that Moore needed to improve something, but he really doesn't."
4,Good Quality & Purchase,"Book in excellent condition, illustrated perfectly - really vivid colours in printing. Just great for a gift (which is what I needed for my geek ;) brother, so I bought it!)Bit late in receipt (ordered 26/08, came 26/09 - international basic shipping, I know... but it came bit late for the birthday celebration...)Anyways - Excellent Quality!"
5,Wow! Simply a great read!,"I read that this book is one of the best graphic novels out there, so I was intrigued, but what got me to buy this book was that it is going to feature film and is on slate for release March '09. Outside of all that, I read the book, cover to cover, in 3 days, man I couldn't put it down, and I work full time. The characters are just fantastic, and the framing of every scene is like nothing I've ever seen, it's a ride that I didn't want to end, but when it did come I was too eager to start reading again, making sure I hadn't missed anything. You actually root for these people who are trying to save the world."
4,Must Have,"This collection has a great reputation, being heralded as one of the greatest novels of all time. It's got a great story, fantastic art work, and it really is a page turner.I was however, at times, somewhat waiting for it to really grab me. It didn't seem to do that, but for some unknown reason I just couldn't put it down. It's dark in places and a true graphic novel.It is a must have for all comic and great drama fans. The characters are compelling, and addictive, and finding yourself thinking about the book days later is a nice surprise.I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good read. I do think however, that it was maybe a little too over rated. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, I just thought it was going to be a little different. So approach Watchmen with a completely blank canvas of an attitude and sit back and enjoy!"
5,Excellent work for what already is a classic,"DC people made an excellent work with both the oversized printing and the sturdy, slipcased hardcover binding.An absolute classic story in its own, I'll spend no words on it, too much has already been written!, it deserved such a treatment.I couldn't almost find a single flaw in this edition, if it wasn't for the quality of the surface of the slipcase and cover, which has a very nice feeling, but is somewhat delicate and easy to damage.The extra material is very interesting; the new coloring is very beautiful, even if affectionate readers might have preferred to retain the old one."
4,"Excellent, but flawed","Watchmen is a superb piece of work let down by one serious flaw. The main 'bad guy' has a masterplan so monumentally stupid and conrived that I have never been able to swallow it.A pity because EVERYTHING else is perfect - characters, art, structure, writing, setting.Its also not Alan Moore's best work - the first half of V For Vendetta (which trailed off) and the wonderful English take on ET, 'Skizz' are better."
5,New to graphic novel medium,"Watchmen is more than a long comic book. However, being a long time text reader, I am having to adjust to it. I thought you could kind of skim it like the Sunday comics, but no, you have to invest time and pay attention or you will soon be lost."
2,I've Read Better,"Seriously, the storyline is really cliche and nothing special. The glowing blue smurf known as Dr. Manhattan is cool, but invincibility is never as appealing as imperfections. Heroes such as Naruto and Batman are way better because they're humans; they're examples of what the human spirit can accomplish. I doubt most of us would be willing to walk around completely naked, have our humanity basically wiped, and get blasted with toxic chemicals."
3,"Good, But Not Great","This graphic novel has it all. The art is good (not great though), the story is tight with details that reveal themselves with further readings. There is imagery, foreshadowing and other literary devices absent in so many graphic novels. With so many great things going for this I could only give it 3 stars because the ending was disappointing, it was a little too gritty for my taste and somehow, despite the parts, the whole was less than their sum."
3,watchmen a mix of good and stupid,"...I would not really call The Watchmen the ""Citizen Kane of graphic novels."" It is more like Tarentino's movie, Pulp Fiction, multiple plot lines, hip references, and plenty of gory violence and power trip fantasies to satisfy a basically adolescent audience. But it is not as good as Pulp Fiction. For ambition,for the acheivement of taking the form to a new level, for superficial complexity, for the effective blending of story telling and art work, I give it an A. For content, for ideas, for genuine insight into the human condition, I give it a C minus."
3,Doubtless an excellent graphic novel...,"...but a bit too aware of itself. However, it must be said that 'Watchmen' took comics out of the playground and into the library. It's not exactly literature, but it's not exactly Mills & Boon either. The art is quite sloppy in places, and for the first third it doesn't appear to be going anywhere, but if you're prepared for a hard initial slog, and then a second closer reading, you'll be amply rewarded. By no means a masterpiece."
3,Great read...bad ending,I bought this for my husband's birthday. He had been commenting on the movie commercials so I thought he would love this book. He read it in 3 days! He said it is a good book but he didn't like the ending. I didn't read it so I'm not much help so I guess you have to read it yourself!
4,"Overrated, but for its time it was a master piece..","I've been collected comics for the last 20 years, and I never had the time to read this series until someone bought this for me as a gift. I heard all the rumors of how amazing this book was for its time, but after reading it and making up my own mind I can honestly say that the book is a tad overrated. Now don't take this the wrong way, its a great book with a very deep message, but if you've been an active comic reader for the last 10 years you would agree that this book is a little on the tame side compared to todays products.Overall its a good book, but I wouldn't put it in my top 10 list of all time favorite comics."
4,Pretty Good,"To be honest, if you've read Michael Moorcock's non-fantasy novels, you've read most of what's new in comics from Gaiman to Morrison. Moore, too, took a lot from Moorcock (including his'JC' signature characters) but is probably the only graphic writer to have built solidly on his original inspiration. Read this and then read From Hell and you will see a writer developing his craft to a very high degree -- getting better, subtler, more pointed. This still remains one of the classics of the field, but Moore has come a long way since then. Only Moore really backs up the claims of comics fans that the medium has reached some kind of maturity. There is mature work out there, including Bryan Talbot's Tale of One Bad Rat and his Luther Arkwright stories, but Moore remains the most consistent and interesting of the great innovators."
4,A very good read,"I saw pictures from the ""Watchmen"" graphic novel for years but I never bothered to read it. I thought the idea of the story (amoral super heroes) seemed stupid at the time so I avoided it (the novel). I was shocked to discover how good it actually was when I read through it at a Barnes and Noble recently. I think this is one of the best Graphic Novels that I have ever seen and I think it should be made into a movie someday.The ""heroes"" in the story are more like we would be if we were super heroes. They are very human. They really make you consider what super heroes would be like if they were real.This is worth your time and your money if you like dark gritty super hero tales."
2,Watchmen ebook only for kindle fire? Why?,Why is is the Watchmen available only for the Kindle Fire? When are they gonna make it available for those with iPad (via an Amazon app?) That's very greedy on Amazon's and DC's part.
2,Not easy to read on a Kindle,"Graphic novels are one of the varieties of books that my co-ed book club likes.I was initially happy to find this for the Kindle, but it's tiny to read. I would recommend at least a big iPad or on a big screen monitor."
5,Brilliant,"This is the greatest comic ever written. The symbolism, and meaning is extremely deep, and the characterization is incredibly sharp. This book tells a brilliant self contained story, not soiled by sequels, and the like. Read this, you won't regret it."
5,Mind Shattering!,"I think I speak for a lot of people(who didn't read watchmen before) when I say ""The movie trailer was CONFUSING!!!!!!"" That's probably the main reason why I bought this book. I'm only half way through, but WOW the writing is good. Now I know why it's in the Time Magazine top 100 list and won a Hugo. If you plan to watch the movie but was confused by the trailer, or just want a really really really good comic to read, buy this, you won't regret it.(Besides the Amazon price is half of the cover price, what a bargain!)"
5,Perfection,"Wow this was worth every penny. Even though I already own a TPB of Watchmen this just sounded too good to pass up, and boy was I right. The larger pages only help the art, the new color seperations make it look even better, but not so glossy as to distract, and all the extras are so in depth. I especially loved reading Alan Moore's sampled script pages. The only thing this is lacking is some current input from the creators, but that can't be helped, due to some decades old arguements not worth getting into here. So barring that one complaint, I would say absolute if definitly how I would describe it."
4,A well thought out and executed comic,I really enjoyed it. There are a lot of layers here and the art is first rate. Well worth it.
5,Think comic books are for kids? Read this...,"Those who thought comics were kid stuff have to look at this, this is what super heroes would be if they existed is just a start. Saying that this is just a comic is like saying the Beatles are just a rock band."
5,Everything I hoped it would be (and more),"After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I decided to go ahead and purchase this product. I will admit that it was not what I expected, but after the first issue I was hooked. Very engaging story that took many dark twists and turns. Highly recommended."
5,Who Watches The watchmen,This is the first graphic novel i read before and i wasn't diapointed this book is awesome. i'm hoping to read more of Alan Moore's books. this book was good.
4,My first graphic novel....,"While I was a huge comic fan as a kid, this was the first graphic novel I've read, and the first comic I've read in 8 years. It was a great reintroduction to a wonderful medium. I had always been more of a Marvel fan in my comic heyday, but DC held ingenuity I hadn't seen. The story is more believable than your traditional superhero vs. supervillian.I decided to read ""The Watchmen"" after I heard that it had won a Hugo Award, and was on the Time list of top 100 novels. The Watchmen has set the bar high for graphic novels, and I look forward to dabbling more into this genre."
5,Who watches the Watchmen?,This is a fantastic graphic novel. Do yourself a favor and immerse your mind into this book before the film version comes out next March. I looked around for it and I found it cheapest on Amazon.
4,Watchmen,I love it. It's one if the best graphic novels I've read. I just hope the movie lives up to the book.
4,Great read. paper quality of comic not so,the story is great. i was a bit disappointed with the paper quality used though. that said its still worth buying and would definitely recommend to anyone.
5,READ IT!! Even if you're NOT a comic book fan!,"I'll confess something right away: I'm NOT a comic book fan. I've never really read individual comic books or followed characters thru yrs of changes, variations, versions, etc. I've always been more interested in graphic novels & Watchmen was one of the 1st I ever read. This isn't a comic book series in the traditional sense; it's a complete story with characters that seem real, the type of people who could exist even in our world. There's a lot of buzz about the film coming out early next yr but I predict that 10 yrs from now, MORE people will be reading & re-reading this book than will be watching the film on DVD or it's successor formats."
4,A good story that felt very rushed,Watchmen is a very untraditional super hero graphic novel that feels to grand for its limited length. It feels rushed at times and falls flat at the end. I do think it's a very good graphic novel but I fail to see the reason for all the hype and awards. The story starts at a good pace. I think Alan Moore thought he had years to complete the story when the story was originally released as a monthly comic. Then somewhere around chapter 7 or so it starts to feel rushed. Like DC decided to put a 12 issue limit on Moore so he had to tie loose ends up.The reason I purchased this book is because I used to be a big comic book fan and I wanted to read it before watching the movie. I am still interested in the Movie and think it would be a good idea to read the book before seeing it since I hear it ends differently. Hopefully they do a better job at the end.
3,"Good, but not the best!","I thought it was a very very good book...for it's time! Don't get me wrong, yes, it was a great book! Everyone should read this!! I just thought it was a long long long long read, for such a so so ending. If you haven't read this, please give it a try, I just didn't think it lived up to the ""Best Graphic Novel"""
4,Better than the movie,"I had never heard of the Watchmen prior to the movie hype. In fact, I haven't read a comic book in years. Curious about the movie, I ordered the graphic novel to read. I found it to be very well done and fairly deep for a comic book. Quite enjoyable to read. While the movie was very good, I really enjoyed the graphic novel."
5,Watchmen Graphic Novel Review,This is one of the best graphic novels i have read. It captures you into the story and it is hard to put down once you start. The ending is awesome and the views of the different heroes in the book is just phenominal!I would recomend this to anyone who loves to read about superheroes.
3,Too much Hype?,"I'm not sure but I think this book is a little over-hyped.I collected comics for a while and this series came out when I did, as individual issues. Even then this series got incredible critical acclaim. I never collected them but through the years I've always wanted to read this book. So when I saw the preview for the film I thought now is the time so the movie doesn't ruin it for me.Perhaps it was the hype back in the day or the hype on this site and others or the hype on the book jacket itself.""One of Time Magazine's 100 Best English-Language Novels since 1923""That's a lot of hype.I just don't think it lives up to it.In any way.Or perhaps it did live up to it when it was first released and just hasn't aged that well.Either way it is interesting enough to check it out but if I had a do-over I would borrow it or buy it used.I know this won't go down well with the devout but their reviews are much too biased to be taken seriously.P.S. I thought V for Vendetta was better."
1,Boo for not being compatable,I probably would have loved it if I were able to read it on my kindle! I am sad to not have been able to enjoy it even though this was supposed to be a kindle offering.
3,Better to watch the Watchmen,"Great twist ending! Story chugs along slowly, somewhat confusing, artwork is nothing spectacular. The only reason to read this instead of just watching the movie is the great sub-story of the Black Freighter."
5,Fantastic!,"The graphic novel itself is, I venture to say, better than the movie. Granted, it does follow suit rather nicely. If you like graphic novels, suspense and super heroes, it will blow your mind."
5,Exceptional,"I first heard of Watchmen while watching Linkara's Atop the Fourth Wall, located here:[...]He said it was one of his favorites and ranted about the movie, so I got curious. I picked it up in the book store a few weeks later to read and found it too good to put down. I ordered it the same day, feeling strongly that it belonged in my library.This was, simply put, the first comic - or graphic novel, rather - that I have ever counted among the best literature I've read. It was engrossing, engaging, and thought provoking, with enough ambiguity to keep anyone interested for quite a length of time. If you only ever read one comic, make it this one."
1,Awful on the Kindle Fire,It so bad I asked for a refund .It would be great on an iPad but Amazon is stupidly restricting it to the Fire which is too small and lacks all the benfits of a great app like Comixology.Eventually Amazon will remember they're in the business of selling content and open it up to the iPad. There's no reason not to.
3,"Five star book, one star app.","After 25 years this book remains fresh and vital. It plays more as a period piece written in contemporary times. The story is a compelling one, a page turner, but also one that leads the reader to reflection upon the multitude of viewpoints through which we learn the whole tale.This book is at the top of everyone's list , and deservedly so, with thousands of reviews praising its excellence.I love this book.However, the dismal performance of the kindle app in delivering this ebook is appalling. The download was woefully slow. Panel view is either non-functional or nonexistent, which is particularly galling as the strict grid layout of this book would seem to be made for this feature. There is even no manual zoom function.On the plus side the app does keep track of which page I'm on.My disappointment with the performance of the app with this book will influence my future purchases."
5,My first comic book,This was the first graphic novel I've read and I loved it. I strongly recommend this book. Read it now!
3,Not what it seems,"Praise is like a double edge sword. Sure, it makes people aware of a book and broadens its potential audience. However, it can also raise lofty goals and if it fails to reach it, well...it can get messy. When I came back into comics, I heard this name oer and over and over again. So, I was inclined to find out why this was a buzz amongst comic readers. So, before leaving for home, I found it..and read it..and was left rather empty. Sure, it has it moments. The ending is rather nice and certain moments makes this book wondeerful. In the end, it just falters in my opinion. It tries to weave so many storylines together and after a while, I was lost (meaning I had to read it over...and over again) and just lost interest. But, for its innovations it brought, I suggest people give it a read."
1,Why does Kindle let you download products that don't work?,I purchased The Watchman for Kindle and it kept trying and trying to download... but it never would. I revisited the site and discovered it's for Kindle Fire only - but that was after the return period of time. Bummer! So I'm stuck with a purchase for my Kindle and Kindle Reader (on iPad) that I cannot read... I wish I could determine if the electronic version of The Watchmen is as good as the print version - but I'll never know...
2,Over-rated,"When I read the reviews here and when I learned that TIME ranked ""Watchmen"" in the top 100 novels (n.b., not graphic novels) since 1923, I expected something on the same plane as the other works on that list (http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html) -- a genre-busting tour de force. I may be a victim of high expectations, but in my judgment, a masterpiece this is not.""Watchmen"" may have a bit more depth than the average comic (or perhaps it's that it brought about an increase in the depth of the average comic, akin to how the fine but no longer outstanding Mona Lisa was revolutionary in its day), but I don't see it as a worthy recipient of the lavish praise it receives. Don't believe the hype."
4,"If you're a fan, you'll want this.","The book itself is a great one if you're looking for looking for a graphic novel like this. My only complaint is that the cover was slightly bent because of the way it was packaged. Otherwise, if you're a fan of the movie and you want to know where it all started, this is a good buy."
2,It's alright,"Not a masterpiece everyone makes out to be. Although compare to other graphic novels, it's alittle bit better. Bascially a murder mystery that along the way in solving it, goes into each of the character's backstory until mystery is solved in the end. Ending somewhat disappointing and boring."
2,rubbish,"Watchmen is bloated and overwritten. Moore drags the story on far too long, and his obsession with literary significance destroys any sense of clarity and power(an all too common thing in comics now). I gave it 2 stars just because of Gibbon's adequate pencils and character designs. One of the few interesting artistic elements is that very juxtaposition between flashy, hollow writing and relatively solid drawing. Unfortunately, if this project were to be done now, it wouldn't even have the relatively solid drawing."
1,Over hyped and self important.,"I bought Watchmen based mainly on reviews and the super-hype I read about. It starts off pretty good i must admit, setting the scene nicely for an interseting read. But all to quiclky it becomes self involved, with little interest in entertaining the reader. It essentially waffles! I cared little for the characters, so why would I care about their histories/psyches? Art is very good considering when it was written."
2,lackluster,"Not as good as everybody said, kinda boring...although it was much better than the movie by far. The movie was not good at all."
4,Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?,"Watchmen (Paperback)by Alan Moore (Author), Dave Gibbons (Illustrator) is an important work of fiction, both to the comic book world and just as a work of fiction. The Watchmen stands out as a revisionist history tale that captures the feel of the real world 1980's and the tensions that were building towards the end of the Cold war and blends them with the sometimes ridiculous nature of comic book escapism. Like any good story that paints a true picture, it's sometimes difficult to look at, but you are compelled on by the characters and the tensions that drive them. The end hasn't aged as well as the rest of the story. But the point is still there, and still as sharp as ever."
5,Fascinating book!,"I could not put this book down. It's a fascinating story, and the details make you want to re-read it over and over to catch everything."
5,A must read before seeing the movie,"I purchased this item when the theater release of Watchmen was getting close, and I am SOO glad I did. After seeing the movie, which I loved, I could imagine seeing it without reading the book first. The book itself is a masterpeice by all forms of the definition. A person who is not into comic books or super heroes in general can easily enjoy this thoroughly, and I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't. Though it's not for young children, it is great for adults of all ages. If you haven't read this book, you should. Plain and simple."
5,First Graphic Novel,"I am an avid reader but this was my first graphic novel. I had just finished ""Cavalier and Clay"" by Michael Chabon which centered around the comic book industry in the '30s and '40s. When The Watchmen was touted as one of the most important novels of the last century, I figured that this was a 'comic book' worth trying. I was more than pleasantly surprised by the art and depth of the plot; but most surprising was the character development. Usually science fiction and mystery writers focus on the plot and leave the character development behind; The Watchmen didn't. The variety of characters created a rich backdrop for the plot and the uniqueness of the whole structure of the novel worked very well instead of being an annoying device. I am now recommending this book to all my reader friends and it will be my choice for my book club on my next turn. My bookshelves are full and need some weeding, but The Watchmen will be staying put.Watchmen"
5,Watchmen: A Classic graphic novel,"I never was really interested in comics and graphic novels until I took a class on them. The first graphic novel we read was Watchmen. I have always been a fan of Batman, but I never had heard of Watchmen. It was a great story, and now ranks up there with Batman, for me. It's not too fantastic to believe, yet it still has elements of super-hero comics. I found the novel extremely thrilling and suspenseful. I recommend this book to everyone, even if you have not read any comics or graphic novels. It offers another thrilling super-hero type story in addition to the classic Batman, Superman, and Spider-man."
5,Fantastic version of a fantastic book!,"This is the perfect buy for all people who love Alan Moores masterpiece! The Absolute Edition is the definite version of Watchmen, made to follow you for many years to come."
5,This is the one that put comics on the map,"Nothing bad to say about this book, great art, writing and execution. One of the first comics to show fantasy heroes living in an everyday world. An amazing read that left me wanting more when I was finished.If you are a fan of this genre, you definitely want this in your collection!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Read It,Read this a few years ago. First graphic novel I read for pleasure (read Maus for a history class). Terrific story and images. Highly recommend. The movie did some justice to the story but do yourself a favor and read the novel.
5,"A definitive, must-read classic!",I'll keep this short and sweet - for me this book is worth far more than what it costs - and I would highly recommend it to just about anyone.
5,Timeless,As relevant today as it ever was. Fear begets fear and we become what we abhor. This speaks volumes about who we are and the choices we make as we journeys to who we may become.
1,All this about a comic book?,"Do you read comic books, or is it more of a looking thing? This is great if you've never had the chance to read any philosophy. It's philosophy is right there on the surface in a superficial way only a comic book could hope to do. But, as most readers probably have more of a background in dungeons and dragons and magic the gathering, the comic looks pretty intelligent. Wow, that blue guy is pretty detached, huh. I suggest skipping this and getting a real book where you might actually learn something if you read it.Sorry to be derogatory. As someone who reads real books seeing people heap this praise on a comic book is kind of absurd. If someone was that serious about their story I can only assume they would pick a different format. I know college age graphic artists will argue, but comics aren't going to be replacing Hemingway anytime soon. Old man and the sea would probably be better if there were small pictures and word bubbles everywhere."
1,"Corny, melodramatic writing","Moore's original burst of inspiration was to take a form of children's literature - the super-hero comic book - and fuse it with the Hemingway-derived melodrama of the hard-boiled school of crime and detective fiction. Teenagers, poorly-read and possessing malnourished tastes in prose, were predictably awestruck by the results. They thought it was 'realistic'; they thought this was 'great literature'."
1,Why?,I like Alan Moore. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Awesome! Top 10? Great stuf! Watchmen? Blah!Esoteric and artificially deep. I could not finish it. I did not care about the characters at all. Who cares! Oh boo hoo I am a brooding super hero. Feel my pain?Don't waste your time.
1,Hn.,"I rather liked Ror Schach, but I think the whole thing was rather overrated. Or perhaps, as some readers say, it's a bit dated. It could easily have been much better when it was more current. It just didn't really 'click' with me.I prefer The Sandman by Neil Gaiman or the JLA series."
5,Annus Mirabilis,"Together with Spiegelman's MAUS and Miller's The Dark Knight Returns this masterpiece changed the face of the comics' medium forever!It is easy, there is no one like Alan Moore."
3,Meh.,"I guess I just don't get what is sooo revolutionary about this graphic novel. Mediocre art work, a long fairly boring, if not weird story, and more hype than necessary, make it so-so. But like I said, I guess I just don't get it."
3,"Not really a ""masterpiece"".","I'm not going to make this long but basically I saw the trailer for the movie and was blown away. When I found out it was based on ""the greatest graphic novel of all time"" I knew I just had to get a copy. I'm not much of a comic person but the artwork is impressive. The story has interesting characters, the ending is VERY unpredictable. Other than that, if you're like me and you read lots of novels, short stories, and movie scripts don't expect to be knocked off your feet.I hope the movie does well for everyone involved. The special effects will have everyone running to see it. After the first two weeks of release we'll see how well it does. If you're like me, a person who had never even heard of the Watchmen before, read the book and post what you think.Not bad but not ""incredible"" either."
1,CRASHES WHEN DOWNLOADING TO IPAD!!!!!! Had to get a refund...,How disappointing! I read the book in the 90's and was really excited to download it to my ipad but it was not to be... I purchased and then asked for a refund (4 times actually). It just gives a download error - and it's the only book that has given me this trouble... so obviously there's a problem here. Any chance of this being corrected in the near future?
1,won't open,returned because I could not open this on my Padigital device.Required update not available at the amazon app store
3,"well witten, slow moving","There is no doubt that this is a brilliant piece of writing-for some reason I just couldn't finish it-I guess it seems to me the story is not about a grand idea(I may have to read the ending to see if I'm wrong!)and if I'm going to invest the time I want something like Asimov's Foundation which involves the future of all mankind-this book may involve that theme, but about halfway through there is not enough of a tease to keep me interested and try as I might I was skipping pages just to get a ahead and finally stuck it on my bookshelf unfinished. I'm hoping the movie will tell me the ending!!"
3,Meh,"I read this a while ago, before the movie or the Times picked up on it. The comic itself isn't so bad, but the characters aren't written or scripted in a way that would make me share some type of feelings with them. There are only a couple twists, and the whole story itself is pretty complete I felt, meaning they pretty much covered all their bases (history) with the characters and kept to the story for the main part. A few dialogues could of been removed as it seem to break away from the theme of the comic, otherwise it was an okay read, nothing great.I know once the movie was in production this novel has been hyped as much as 'The Dark Knight', and I would definitely recommend reading the novel instead of watching the movie because it was, for lack of better words, god awful."
5,I'm Watching The Watchmen,"This book is just all around amazing. It has so many real life issues that many people can relate to all tied to a plot taking place in 85 where Nixon is still president and the Russians are trying to invade its surrounding enemies. Not to mention the ""Watchmen"". Ordinary people dressing up in costumes to bash ""evil"". There is one super-hero in this book and it is by accident. If you love graphic novels or you are considering picking one up for the first time this one is a great start.Not to mention they are making a movie based on the Watchmen that comes out 03/06/09. There are twists at every turn of the page and the writing is brilliant. The images are iconic for its time. Pick this up and delve right into Watchmen."
5,Don't Mess with Rorschach,"I have read folks ranging from Shusako Endo to Graham Greene, Tolstoy to Shakespeare, Dostoevsky to Palahniuk, Homer to Walker Percy. Alan Moore, I know, large grand sweeping claim coming, ranks up there with the best. Just because someone illustrates your words does not mean it is somehow beneath others. This is simply a classic piece of work that you need to read. Especially with the film coming out, and who knows how that will be, devour this book."
5,Who Watches the Watchmen.?.,I have read this story several times and it keeps getting better with every read. It never lets you want to leave the story with it's gripping plots and beautiful imagery. There is no wonder why it still to this day is one of the best comic book stories ever written...
5,The Perfect Art of ANY medium!,"To an artistic mind, this book is genius. Better than genius, even.The words, images, and overall theme tie in together for an amazing cohesive experience. Many beautiful tricks are used to transfer the reader's mind from one image to another, or from one line of dialogue to the next frame. There's not much point in my writing a very long review, so I'm keeping this short. So, in short, this graphic novel is perfect!I have to admit that the art style is very conservative. Not bland, by any means, but it's very clean cut, and flat. The colors used are not over-stylized or anything like that. Think of the art style as being the opposite of Ben Templesmith. Good anatomy, detailed backgrounds, etc."
3,Ok,I thought this book was over hyped. I want to see the movie again and see how I feel about it then.
5,Loved it,"Amazing. I love the approach to so many different characters, all with their mistakes and sins but never without some moments where you have no choice but to sympathize. Every single panel and every single word was clearly thought out and only make the story take you deeper after each read.I was able to find a used one (but still in great condition) for less than 10 dollars. There really isn't much more I could have asked for haha."
4,Surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised with this graphic novel. I was expecting some light comic fare but was immediately grabbed by the gritty and dark world. Enjoying the character and setting immensely. Highly recommended. If I find this in a large form factor, will probably buy it too as the artwork deserves to be enjoyed to the fullest. An excellent buy and great value. I did not have any previous knowledge of the Watchmen and have been avoiding the movie and surrouding hype to ensure I got the best out of the original book. Glad I did..."
5,Watchmen - Review,"Amazing, amazing book. One of the best books I've ever read, and I'm an English major. Anyone who wants to see the graphic novel form at its best, or just wants to read a compelling story that will move you and challenge you to think MUST read Watchmen."
5,The Real World Affected By Superheroes,"Moore and Gibbons' Watchmen is perhaps the greatest of all comics creations. It displays the real world and its co-existence with costumed vigilantes, and how their lives have shaped the future of civilization. This is not kiddie-fare, but an intelligent, adult story with complex characters, and sometimes brutal and grotesque images. The Dark Knight Returns, Marvels, and Kingdom Come all fall short of the grandiose journey that is the Watchmen"
4,Better than I expected,"I never really got into superhero comics, and while Watchmen is quite a bit more sophisticated than most of the ones I've been exposed to, it indulges in enough of the genre's brash fantasy to keep me from being as excited about it as a lot of people are. That said, I did really enjoy it. Alan Moore's alternate 20th century is more interested in its (mostly) mortal heros' politics and relationships than their powers and gadgets, and through their trials, it asks some good questions about social reform and the complex nature of human conflict. It is literate, well-structured, rich with subtext, and strikingly rendered."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,"This is the second graphic novel I've read. The first was Heroes volume One which advertised Watchmen at the back. That advertisement sold it well and it really lived up to my expectations. I found this an intriguing, exctiting and 'novel' read with a touch of black humor in places too. From a newbie's standpoint I'd recommend it."
2,Not the right cover art!,"Ordered this as a replacement. Searched everywhere for a particular version ad thought I found it. Unfortunately, it's the right issue but wrong cover art. :( The picture shows exactly what I was looking for and I didn't get that."
2,Watchmen,"Watchmen was recommended to me by several intelligent friends, and though I have been wary of the genre I figured I'd give the graphic novel a go. I saw the movie when it first came out, and I think that was detrimental to my reading of the original text. As printed material I found Watchmen to be surprisingly unappealing. The film seems to be very close to the original, but far surpasses the comic in terms of visual interest. The women were particularly disturbing, as the movie had lead me to believe they were supposed to be attractive, and not have .. mullets (yes, the original Silk Specter has a mullet in the text).I wish I had read Moore and Gibbons before seeing the film - I think I would have enjoyed it much more. As it stands, it was actually fairly slow-going for very little end reward."
5,Excellent compilation,"This is a compilation disc of the years 1975 - 1978 when Gong were playing jazz fusion. The tunes come fromShamal(4 cuts),Gazeuse!(3 cuts), andExpresso II(4 cuts). If I were to burn a CD from those albums I would have picked the same tunes, however, I would have placed them in chronological order - they are not this way on this disc. What made Gong's style of fusion stand out for me was the use of vibes, which is not the norm. It added a color and timbre to the music that made it sound open, warm and unique. Of course the stellar musicians including Allan Holdsworth on the latter two releases didn't hurt either. There seems to be a division between Daevid Allen's Gong and this lineup of Gong. Personally I liked both, and I wouldn't recommend this to those who don't like fusion, but for those who do, and don't want to buy all three releases, this is an excellent compilation."
4,Entertaining and Interesting,"As a fan of Ian Gillans work in both Deep purple, and then as a solo act with the ""Gillan Band"", I really enjoyed this book.Ian comes across as a very down to earth character, and gives much insight into his lyrics, and his feelings about performing and life on the road.He dosn't take himself too seriously, and I laughed more than a few times! Sheds some light on his turbulent relationship with Purple Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore."
1,Do not get this book! It's unnecessary!,"I just took my citizenship test today; this book was not helpful at all!Instead, go to the INS site and download the 100 questions which are listed as sample questions.These are the same questions you'll be asked. Your interviewer will ask you 10 questions from that list. So, just prepare for those 100 questions and you'll do fine.Good luck!"
5,Citizenship Passing the Test,"The information contained provided key points, my friend from Russia passed easily. She became a naturalized American in March of 2012.I would post a photo of that eventful day but this venue aparently has no option to do so."
2,Why?!?,"I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone over the age of ten would buy this book. In a book listing the 300 ""greatest"" attack & interceptor jets, why would there be 5 individual pages to the Hawker Sea Hawk and no listings for the early (WW II era) Gloster Meteor. And what on earth are listings for the Lockheed large transport aircraft doing in a book on combat aircraft. The author clearly was simply filling space and given the limited & questionable information provided about each aircraft, one would have to ask if the author had more than a passing interest in the subject to begin with. In depth, knowledgeable information is lacking. This book might make a grade schooler smile but for this price a serious attempt at researching the material might have been offered. My advice would be to stay away from this whole series of books. If this is a sample, the rest can't be much better."
2,"Book review, not an article","This is a review of a book by Douglas Brooks, not an original research article by Lukas Erne. It is not labeled that way in the Amazon search results."
2,"Strong bag, flimsy zipper","People who order this bag are expecting something sturdy to load all their dive gear into for a trip. Well, the first time we packed it, the flimsy zipper came unstitched and we had to take it to a shoe repair shop and spend another $20 to get it fixed. We decided on this option vs. sending it back because the bag is sturdy and we did not want to go through the return process. In the end, we ordered another dive bag on rollers and will only use this bag as a spare. If you are looking for a good dive bag, I would buy something else."
4,Wonderful product,I would highly recommend this product to anyone with neck or back pain. It has been a miracle for me.
5,Good foam rollers,Foam rollers was expected when purchased. Bought these to use on the IT band and hamstrings. They were the right size for this purpose.
4,Fair for the price,Product is good for the money. It is not the hardest material you can buy in the foam rollers. This should last a while but will have to be replaced sooner rather than later.
2,Foam roller,I tried to find a foam roller that would give a tad. I really did not want an extra firm one. I bought the extra firm for a friend AND this one. I seriously think they are both the same. Very disappointed. They need more descriptions in their advertising.
1,DON'T BUY HALF-ROLLER!,"Do not buy the half-roller. The full-round rollers are sealed all the way around. The half rollers are full rollers mechanically cut in half. This means that one side is RAW, and thus a snow of plastic dust flies out when you open it, and whenever you touch it. Plastic dust that you can't avoid breathing in.It's horrible. I am extremely disappointed in this product."
1,Not worth the money.,Do not buy this product. It is lowest quality of form roller I have purchased.The form is not high dense enough. it dented after couple of use and does not look good or professional.Not recommend!
2,Good for a while,"I love foam rollers. I had this one for a few months, but it unfortunately became warped and did not roll very well anymore. I have since purchased a more firm, pvc type roller that is MUCH better and worth the additional cost. The Isokinetics foam roller was discarded."
2,steer clear,Item poorly cut and not straight. Both half rollers i purchased are curved. one is significantly shorter than the other. Shipped in GARBAGE BAG. Seller claims they were shipped in a custom made tube. I have pictures to the contrary. Other comments left regarding itme by others indicated garbage bag packaging as well. Do not recommend seller or item.
4,Full Round Foam Roller,"I had expected there to be a solid core for stability, but other than that, I like the foam roller and it gives me an opportunity to work on body balance anytime at home."
3,Arrived bent,"Arrived with some curvature. I have had it for over a month hoping it would flatten out but it hasn't.This doesn't prevent it from doing what it should, but its an irritant."
1,"6""x36"" Half-Round is only slightly over 5.5"", not six","I have 2 full round rollers that have been great and are doing a fantastic job of holding up their shape. I have back problems and decided to purchase a half-round one from seller ""herternursery"" to sleep on. When it came, I was disappointed, immediately noticing that it was not completely straight. It was curved from storage or shipping. This indicates that the foam is of lower density or quality. Size-wise, it is also noticeably thinner than a full-round roller cut in half. I compared the sizes by stacking the end of the half-roll against a full roll. The half-roll is not exactly half of the round roller. Measuring with a ruler, I found out that the width is only about 5.5"", making the height (radius) of this half-roller less than 2.5"" when it should be 3"".I am not sure if the product from other sellers is the same as mine, but I am not satisfied with the quality of the half roll I received. Not recommended from this seller."
2,not worth it,"too soft. not happy with the materials used for this product. trying to replace one I had, will keep looking for a better product"
2,Mathematically Challenging,"Before I bought the book I was aware of the problem the church faced in determining the correct date for Easter and the reasons behind the adoption of the Gregorian calendar.This book for the most part is not for the lay person, by that I mean those of us that are not up to speed on Trigonometry and Geometry. I have read books on physics for the lay person involving quantum mechanics that did not require the proficiency in math that this book does. For us the preface and the first chapter will pretty much suffice and be quite satisfying. I have visited the churches in Rome and Bologna. In the Basilica of San Petronio I purchased a small book of 25 pages with a chart in the back for where the sun would fall (minute differences) for every day of the year. The small book for 5 euros explained the mathematics behind the construction of the meridian in terms that I could readily understand. If the math is comprehensible to you then this is a great book."
3,havent read it yet but..,"hate to nitpick but looking at the index, it looks like they used the name bianchi where the modern and accepted name is bianchini(see [...] )3 stars for the effort for now."
4,High quality,"These are very high quality envelopes and come in a nice box. They're a little on the expensive side, but I suppose they're not the most popular size and not a size for normal mailing. I like them because they're the exact size of money and checks and they run well through my printer."
5,EXCELLENT,I don't own this CD but have heard every song on it and they are all great. Anyone who likes Y&T will love this one. I also highly recommend Black Tiger and Earth Shaker. The prices are too high but if you've got the cash it's well worth it for any of the Y&T CD's.5 stars
3,Check the CDs carefully,I found this set from a library and decided to buy one since it is very good for new learners. The set I bought from here doesn't look brand new but still in good condition. But I then found the CD2 was damaged and cannot be played properly. Be aware of this and check your CDs carefully when you get them.
2,Audio disappointing,"Disclaimer: I didn't actually listen to it, or even open the CDs.I was on the hunt for a system that I could listen to in the car during my commute. Reviews on this looked good, so I purchased it. Turns out, there's only 1 or 2 audio CDs...most of it is books."
1,SPANISH BOOK,NOT HAPPY AS IT CAME WITH THREE RING BINDER TYPE PACKAGING..NOT ALLOWED IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY AND SO IT WILL BE RETURNED!!!
5,Strongly recommend for beginners; Fun and Quick,"I bought this set in a local bookstore without reading any previous reviews. It looked like it could actually be good. I have to admit it really works. It will only get you so far with a language, but if you go through the whole set and use the Mastery excersizes on the CDs, you will definetly have a solid base to expand on in further studies. Easy, clear and you can realy take it with you anywhere. Strongly recommend for beginners. You really will start structuring sentences and will quickly grasp what's going on without tedious grammar explanations."
4,Speak in a week hahahaah,"I found it easy to follow and very easy to understand. The book went right along with the CD...but like anything else, you have to practice, practice, practice and my accent sucks!!!But it is a great product to use for a beginer and my husband has gotten many hours of laughter out of my practicing!!!"
4,Spanish cd/book,"This set was a great value!! The books that come with the set are perfect, especially for me because I had a lot of brushing up to do on my Spanish. The audio cd is not much help and is a little fast-paced for me. I could do without it. Overall I would definitely recommend it."
5,Great to get you up and speaking,"I have tried numerous language programs each with different approaches to learning. Each of these have their pros and cons. Speak in a week, if you can dedicate time everyday, does just that. It got me up and conversational quickly. I liked the format and the conversation focus. The first week was easily completed in a week and provided some necessary basics. Each subsequent week was a little more challenging and therefore a little difficult to complete in a week. If you have the necessary time this would also be obtainable. The content of each week is useful and I always felt like I was making good progress and learning useful aspects of the language for use in day to day conversation."
4,Nice format to learn,Had some past knowledge of Spanish so this is a nice review. Can't say I am fluent after 4 weeks but it is easy to spend time in the car with this format.
5,fun and learn,"my 4th grade and 2nd grade girls love it. CD with the books for one sentence in English, one in Spanish. Very easy to follow."
5,A Unique And Wonderful Masterpiece,"About 22 years ago I heard the title track of this song on the radio, upon it's initial Irish release. That afternoon I rushed out bought it (on vinyl, of course) and I can say that few other albums have influenced me more. This is classic DeBurgh on a BIG scale. All the songs have their own strengths in melodic construction, lyricism, storytelling, emotional content, wonderful arrangements, and solid song writing which make it stand out with the best of this artist's work. A wonderful exposition of a delightful imagination. As a diehard original Irish fan, I have never been as fond of DeBurgh's later, more commercial work. But even had his style not evolved as it did, Crusader would still be one of my favorite albums of all time. Love at first listen! Highly reccommended for all Romantics and lovers of great music."
4,Violently emotional,"Can a record be too beautiful? If so, this one is. Crusader overwhelms me with emotions of nostalgia, sadness, beauty, love. It's a really good record, but approach it with the same caution you approach nostalgic memories."
5,"Sweet, sour, brutal, raw, unforgettable viewing.","A Respectable Trade was a fabulous book (go read it now!) and it was made into a fabulous film. All of the actors are superb - and Philippa Gregory herself wrote the screenplay, which gives the production the same magic the book had. The story begins in 1787, when ambitious trader Josiah Cole tries to cilmb the social ladder by asking the well blooded but dirt poor Frances Scott to marry him. Frances, thirty four and desperate, agrees to marry him. If only she'd known what she was getting herself into! It turns out that Josiah makes a good deal of his money trading slaves. Frances learns about the horrors of slavery, and learns about true love - from the kind and clever Mehuru - one of her husband's slaves. Yikes! Sounds like things could get complicated... and they do! It certainly makes for compelling watching."
4,this guy has some yummy goodness going on,"what can i say, you always need some good love songs in your collection, orange cake mix has gotta 'em. and the electro sound is fun for all. fluffy pillow is just that, the music you can bear to sleep to and let in to your subconscious"
1,Not recommended,"The instructions make this appear like a relatively fool-proof process, which it is not. They warn you about smearing adhesive on the screen when it is reinserted into the case, when they SHOULD instead warn you that the screen is extremely fragile and the least bit of pressure on it will crack it and render the iPod useless."
3,WARNING! Proceed with Caution!,"My iPod mini had been acting funny. I'd had it over a year, and all signs were pointing toward needing a new battery. However, I did not want to send it into Apple because it would have taken much longer, and it would have costed more. So, I decided I'd try purchasing this little battery from Amazon; it looked like it would be easy. The computer video was really easy to follow; although, I DID have to rewind and fastforward a few times. I was so excited because my mini turned on immediately after replacing the cover. I plugged it into my computer, and once the battery was charged, I tried to listen to it, but the click wheel wouldn't do anything. I was so bummed. So, basically, the moral of the story is... if you're good at electronic stuff and have experience and a basic knowledge (not just THINK you do, like me), then go for it. But be careful, if you're not, you could end up doing more damage than the thing had in the first place!"
1,I disagree...it's Grisham's WORST book!,"As a Grisham fan, I was disappointed. The characters had no depth, and sounded like something from one of those sickening ""Help The Homeless"" rallies."
2,Definately not his best!!,"I have read all of John Grisham's books and this one is not as interesting or suspenseful or good as some of his others. If you want to read books by John Grisham, pass on this one and pick up ""The Client"" which is my favorite. ""The Street Lawyer"" is definately not worth it!"
4,""" Another Thriller ""","John Grisham has done it again , I really enjoyed this book . Grisham pulled on the heart strings with this one , the pages turn a mile a minute . I really didn't know to much about the the homeless problem untill I read this book . It really makes you think , be greatfull for what you have and not to take it for granted ."
1,Not even up to par for Grisham.,"This book was not up to a Grisham standard. The plot was farfetched and the legal/courtroom action was predictable and boring. His jabs at the Republicans were uncalled for and won't make sense to future readers. This was an obvious ""beat the deadline"" book. This would have been a better op-ed piece in the Washington Post."
2,Grisham Disappoints,"""The Street Lawyer"" is the worst writing by Grisham that has come out to date. The idea is noble and admirable but never comes to fruition. It almost seems like Grisham lost steam halfway through the novel and just used frivolous words to take up pages. This book was a great disappointment, and nothing like a Grisham fan would expect judging by his other works like ""The Chamber"" or ""The Client"". Let's just all hope this one doesn't get made into a movie."
4,Insightful look into the problem of homelessness,This book is not typical of Grisham's usual writings in that he is discussing a more down to earth problem in America. The fact also that the setting for THE STREET LAWYER is our nation's capital makes the problem of homelessness all that much more serious.
2,Grisham Grandstands for Increased Social Programs,"While still a page-turner that only Grisham could create, the author has used ""The Street Lawyer"" as a platform for communicating his political views on the social plight of inner-city degenerates. While the plots of his books have always been far-fetched, this book transcends any inkling of reality when the reader is encouraged to believe that an attorney from a powerful Washington, D.C., law firm would abruptly give up a cushy, high-paying job to fight for the rights of inner-city poor -- for a nominal wage."
1,Simply not Grisham,"As an avid Grisham reader i can't begin to describe my disappointment of this book. Grisham's unique ability as a story teller in his previous works is undetectable here. A poor try to go for another type of writing, one Grisham should avoid in the future. The Street lawyer, is unbelievable, makes no sence, and by no means has the ability to capture you.... Too bad for Grisham and his reputation."
2,Not one of Grisham's Best.,"Interestingly enough I read this book during a 2 hour flight to Washington D.C. and then back again. The plot was extremely predicable, the characters were not well developed and the ending was trite and unconvincing. The homeless depicted in the book were so unsympathetic that I found myself thinking like the Congressman in the book. This was definitely Grisham-lite."
2,The jolly hobo isn't jolly any more.,"Exploitation of the homeless is at an all time high in Grisham's ""Street Lawyer"".Filled with bourgeois myths about the innocent homeless being beaten up on by whoever our current political enemies are, the book misses no opportunity to slip in inexpensive political commentary.Soup kitchen noble savages and straw man victims of those dastardly Republicans, are paraded out in service of the plot, and then tucked away again.Grisham's homeless are not exactly ""Freddy the Freeloader"", but they come no where near rising to the level of human being.They are a cute cause -- little more.Albeit unrealistic, the story is well-told, as are the stories in all of Grisham's novels; but Grisham's noble but naive attempt to help the homeless falls flat."
3,"not his best, comments of cassette version",a cassette can hold 90 minutes of audio. Each cassette in this book only went for 50 minutes. Thereby using 7 more cassettes than was necessary to inflate the price.
2,You call that an ending?,"""The Street Lawyer"" is carefully disguised as a fictional thriller when in reality it turns out to be Grisham's third in a line of overdramatized editorials.Sounding more like a politician than a writer, Grisham bemoans the plight of the homeless in page after page of his latest attempt.Readers of his previous works will long for the excitement of ""The Firm"" and even wind up craving the inanity of ""The Client.""Grisham is at his best when he's writing about the incatracies of the legal system, and inventing characters with depth. He's at his worst when he's injecting politics into a novel.The only thing more annoying than his preaching throughout is when you come to the end and realize you could have enjoyed your time more by viewing ""Ishtar"" twice. Skip this selection, take a look at Tom Clancy's nonfiction instead."
3,Mediocre and Preachy,"Another mediocre outing for Grisham. Although his writing is as crisp and readable as ever, his plot is paper-thin and less than exciting. This one reminded me of ""The Chamber"" - lots of preaching about the evils of the death penalty and very little action. Here Grisham gets on the band-wagon for the homeless, but the hohum plot and characterizations make the sermonizing stand out like a banner. I swore I'd never read another Grisham after being bored to tears by ""The Chamber"", and this confirms my suspicions that the guy only had a few really good stories in him."
1,Awful.The worst of the lot.,Success has taken away the storytelling of the past and is attempting to provide us with a social primer.
2,Anybody wanna buy a book?,I remember when Grisham books were hard to put down. We have now hit the other end of the spectrum. This was hard to pick up. It seems like we are seeing books written for movies by Grisham. I'll probably buy the next book also in hopes that he can re-create the magic. Until then......anybody wanna buy a book?
3,"I see a movie in the making, $$$","Having read all of his books, I'd rate this one in the middle. I did read it non-stop over a weekend and the story line held my interest but Grisham's plotting has become too predictable. In the end, the young lawyer always wins, gets the girl and life goes on. How many variations on a theme must we read before Grisham comes up with something new and entertaining."
1,Grisham's worst book todate.,"This book would never have been published except for the author's draw. I read it in about three hours. There is no suspense. No courtroom drama and a main character who is totally unbelievable. I felt the book must have been written in a couple of weeks, just to meet a deadline. Have never been so disappointed in book."
2,disappointed,"I expected more from the author. It seemed as if he had to fill a book quota and just wrote this to do that. I think it could have been interesting if he had drawn in the murdered congressman, to the law firm or the real estate firm... some sort of surprise."
2,"Preachy, boring story about a very serious problem","Maybe it's because I live in DC and have helped in homeless shelters or read about our city's problems every day in the Post, but I found this book boring and mundane. There was little character development and intrigue. A slow read, easy to put down, not spell-binding like some others. I loved The Firm with its complex plot and multiple characters. This was a big disappointment."
1,Would have made a better Reader's Digest article,"I've read all of Grisham's book and this one was, by far, the worst. All of the homeless characters were not to be believed....all sweet, wholesome and law abiding, except for illegally renting a squatter's room in an old warehouse. And, what an unbelievably nice neighborhood for the legal clinic where our hero can park his Lexus with impunity! GEt real! As for excitement and suspense, the only danger here for our hero was the possible loss of his license and a jail term, none of the terror in previous books where his life was at stake. Time to take a break, John."
4,not vintage GRISHAM,definetly not his best. and almost his worse. the beggining probably ranked up with a time to kill in terms of excitement but then it drags. i was expecting a trial of some sort which really was dissapointing. then he preaches us on the poor. you should learn from day one that it's okay to have plenty of money as long as you've earned it. it's nice to give to charity but you can't always. i found the book to be hardly belivable. i don't know of one person on this earth who would give up an ambitious future as Michael Brock did. and once you find out what the whole point of the book is. it's almost over. Sadly only a real true GRISHAM fan can half appreciate this book.
1,Another soapbox lecture from Grisham,"Just as he did in ""The Chamber"", Grisham gives us a lecture rather than an entertaining novel. Come on John, you've made more money than God with entertaining books. Get on a talk show if you feel the need for some moralizing. I've read all of his books and they all rate a 9 or 10 with the exceptions of his two diatribes - ""The Chamber"" and ""The Street Lawyer"". Grisham's publisher should take a clue from the computer industry - they advertise ""Intel Inside'. These Grisham novels should say ""Lecture Inside""."
5,You either like it or you don't.,"I realy liked this book. Though it wasn't suspenceful,wich realy wasn't the point know was it, it tells a very good story. I like all Grisham books and this is one of the best. As for you how gave this book a 1, though you are entitled to your opion, you can KISS MY ****!!! I thoroughly recommend this book."
2,In a word.......disappointed,"I have read all of Johns books, and living in England have to wait a while for his new ones to get across the pond. This time I would have none of it, so I had a relative import it to me in time to take with me on holiday. To cut my long story short I wish I hadn't bothered. This book is so predictable I wondered what John was thinking. I have come to expect a lot more from him. And why was it so short ??? I will not be recomending this book at all. And I hope and pray that John is happy that he has now cleared his own conscience and gets back to giving us a good read next time out."
2,Grisham has lost his ability to keep the reader hooked,"I am starting to believe that John Grisham is running into deadlines for his publisher. The endings for the past few books have been terrible. The Street Lawyer is the same way. The Street Lawyer suffers from many things, namely, 1.Lack of a plot, the plot in this book is almost non-existent. I enjoyed the first two chapters, but then my interest was lost. 2.Lack of character depth, Michael did an honorable thing, but I think the majority of us cannot identify with him. In Michael's own words ""You'd have to be a fool to jump off of the gravy train I was riding."" 3.Bad ending, even though I thought Michael's case was weak, a trial would have been interesting. Instead, Grisham goes the easy and predictable route. After the first two chapters, I could predict the whole book. In conclusion, The Street Lawyer is a major disappointment from a man that is capable of ""The Firm"" and ""The Client"". I don't think this one is worth $25.00 Try again, John"
3,"Dull but ""nice"" ending","I found the first two thirds of the book hard going and dull. How many times do we have to hear that it's tough on the street? It gets a bit tedious. The ending was predictable and ""nice"". Good job - if he'd done another like The Partner I would have NEVER bought another Grisham."
2,"Worth reading, but not worth $30.00","While I found the book interesting enough to want to finish, I was seriously disappointed in the contents.To me, the book accomplished two things:1- Planted the seed (or perhaps sprouted the existing seed) of social conscience; and2- I found myself about 1/4 through realizing this was a script to a movie, not a novel, and wondering who would be playing various parts. However, even as a movie script, this needs some jazzing up.As with many other reviews here, I certainly hope that VERY SOON I will read somewhere that all proceeds from the book and movie are donated to the homeless shelters. It would be Grisham's only saving grace to his fans. He's not the first author to let us down after a string of best sellers, but he tackled a subject that HE personally can do something about. Let's see it happen, Mr. Grisham."
1,A major let-down.,"This book is a major disappointment.I wonder why there is so much hype in this book.The book is awfully boring and the ending is just and ending, with no suspense or action of any sort.What a waste of money."
1,Thoroughly dissapointing,"Frankly one of Grisham's worst books. I usually finish a book in an hour and if its good I feel dissapointed that I did not take longer - but ""The Street Lawyer"", I finished in about 45 minutes and all I could think later was why I did not finish it faster - it was one of the worst books I have ever read and I was ""thoroughly dissapointed""."
2,Are all these people out of their minds?,I can't believe I'm seeing perfect ratings being awarded to this book. Grisham has surely writen better books in the past. Where do you pull such scores? The book demonstrates to be extremely shallow where no real content may be found. To shallow for even the theme move the reader...
3,Lin's Book Revierw,"From the beginning to the end, this book will have you hooked the whole time. It starts off in a huge corporate lawyer's office, where a homeless man walks in with a gun and fake dynamite. He takes eight lawyers hostage in an office and tells them to call him master. He asks them questions about how much they make and how much they give to the homeless each year. After that shocking experience, the main character decides that he needs to look into what this ""homeless"" thing is all about. He quits his job and starts working one on one with the street people. It is amazing to look into everything that goes on in the streets and is great for all ages. I highly recommend this book."
5,Great Story,"This book was published in 1998,so there have been many reviews written. I cannot add anything to what others have said that loved the book. I throughly enjoyed reading it."
2,A Grisham Reader (Trying to Read and Review All),"As my second JG book, I was looking forward to reading this. It is about a man named Michael Brock who works for one of the largest law firms in the US. He has it all. In a few years, he is expected to be a partner. But, in a days time, it ends with a street man who takes 8 or 9 lawyers hostage. This makes Michael re-evaluate his life and decides he wants to become a ""street lawyer"" and defend such people, basically out of sympathy. Sounds good so far, 'eh? Well, the story and ""goings on"" are not bad, but the ending is so dissapointing. Makes this a horrible book. I felt like the man stole hours out of my life. Of course, I am still a fan and do plan on reading the rest, but The Street Laywer was an upset."
3,Not really a legal story,"I am a big fan of fast paced, SUSPENSFUL legal stories. I've read a few Grisham and have been satisfied, but not overly. This one takes the cake. Is the story about law or is it meant to be warm-fuzzy? I can sympathize with the plight of his new ""clients"" but I wish there was more characterization and motive for the big change in scenery. I finished it only because I was hoping it would get better."
1,Terrible,"This book stunk. I would have assigned it ""0"" stars if that option was available. Don't waste your time reading this boring ""mish-mash""."
1,"The Street Lawyer could be retitled 'The Sedative Lawyer""","I always look forward to a new Grisham story--I have all of his books and ejoyed them immensely.This one however was difficult to finish without falling asleep---it was boring, predictable, and the characters lacked depth.It was such a blatant attempt at writing an ""issue"" book and failed at truly doing that and failing to provide and interesting story as well.It has made me wary of future Grisham novels."
1,not much of a plot,it seems to me that Grisham is runniong out of lawyer plots if this effort is an example of his genre. he makes a statement about society and the homeless but an op-ed article in the NYT would have saved me a few bucks. I do not think we pick up his next book automatically and expect a good effort based on this work. I have enjoyed some and most of his past novels-this one seems to be for the money only.
3,A Friendly Compassionate Lawyer?,"If you suspend your belief for a while this book is a decent read. In retrospect it isn't so hard to believe that someone (even a lawyer) could have a change of heart, but what Michael turns his back on doesn't seem realistic to me. Maybe I am a cynic, but read for yourself. It isn't Grisham's best book, I think A Time to Kill, the Firm, and the Partner are the best ones and it certainly rates better than the Chamber or Runaway Jury."
1,Is That All There Is?,"First of all, I don't read many books. So when I do read one it better be good. This one, my first Grisham novel, started out strong and gave me the impression that my $7 would be well spent. Like this book or not, the guy weaves a decent tale. But after the first 100 pages or so I got to humming that Peggy Lee tune mentioned above. Was the existing plotline all there was to this book? I kept reading on with suspense thinking there would be some surprise awaiting me around some dark corner, not unlike Michael in the seedy DC neighborhoods, but it never materialized. What started out so promising ended up as a potential script for an upcoming episode of The Practice. At least that would have only wasted an hour of my time."
1,The Street Lawyer is one big snooze,"I was so disappointed in this latest Grisham book. I kept expecting things to get interesting and mysterious but all I got was hundreds of pages of social commentary. I read Grisham for escapism, not morality harangues. The plight of the poor and homeless in this country is an abomination, but, I don't think that a novel is the best place for advocacy. Mr. Grisham needs to put his show on the road and raise money for the homeless and get back to writing the books where the pages practically turn themselves."
1,Grisham is becoming predictable,"One of the worst novels I have read.I used to like John Grisham's novels but with time I have become disappointed. The last one is vintage Grisham except that the vintage has grown stale. This novel has a very predictable plot: young lawyer has an outburst of ethical guilt and puts his firm on the dock. Reading the novel was a waste of time, no value added. Seemed like a cut and past of previous novels. If Amazon had an empty star category, this novel would get it.Somebody should tell Grisham to sit back and relax. Maybe it would be better if he wrote a novel once every two or three years. His reputation might improve."
3,Good Message But Not Grisham,This is a very tedious book. Do not get me wrong it had a good messge but the plot was dull. I had some hope of the plot getting better yet I lost it. The court room battle was boring by far and nearly everything after the first chapter. The last to pages did have an alright ending(compared to The Partner). I would have given this book two stars but like I said it had a good message.
2,Bubble-gum book -- the flavor's gone in 10 minutes!,"This was my first Grisham book (though I've seen a few of the movies), and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The protagonist is disappointingly flat as a character, although supporting cast like poverty lawyer Mordecai Green are both realistic and admirable. Not much of a build-up, and the climax was disappointing as well -- everything came too easy. Brock's declaration at the very end about how his life did a 180 in 30 days sums it up -- upon finishing the book, the reader has merely lost the few hours it took to read it. If word processors could write a book on their own, the Street Lawyer would be it."
2,Ummmmmmmmmm.......,This book was well written but boring. It didn't have the action that the two other Grisham's I've read A Time To Kill and The Partner. My advice is if you want to keep on reading grisham don't read this book!
3,"good, but still needs work","This book is, like all the other Grisham books, well written. It gets you interested and rivited from the first few pages, with the action in the office. Then, however, the excitement slowly drains away. The characters are kind of hard to keep straight, and the plot can be tricky. However, it is a good book overall-- just takes a little more thinking and remembering!"
2,Not Grisham's Best,"I found the book quite boring and repeditive. Grisham writes books containing secretive backrooms where mysteries are revealed, a crook that's brought to justice by a nothing lawyer, and of course, a beautiful, long-legged woman in distress."
3,Entertaining but not his best work,"While I'm a big fan of Grisham, I must say that the last couple of his books that I've read (the Partner & this book) have not been up to the level of his earlier works. While this novel was an entertaining read it lacked the suspense and thrills of his other books. I appreciate his efforts at bringing to life the problems of homelessness in our society but at times the book felt rather preachy at the expense of the story and characters. After a great first chapter, the novel just never really goes anywhere. Still though, there's enough conflict between the street lawyer and his old firm to keep the book entertaining enough to finish."
2,"GRABS you tight, then lets you go...","This book started out incredibly intriguing and was full of potential but ended very ""blah."" It could have had the excitement of The Firm but Grisham chose a different route. I found the story very interesting, but am so disappointed knowing what it could have been... Am looking forward to The Partner as I've heard its quite a story."
5,Touching to say the least,"The novel is touching. I am really surprised how so many reviewers say the novel is amazing to the point they are excited about homelessness. Having seen it it all in multiple countries, the problem in US is far less compared to developing countries. US it becomes worse in harsh winters. But still, it is far better in US with generous donations from people for food banks etc. Having volunteered in many food banks, I am astonished at amount of food they get on a daily basis. Grisham has captured the essence very well and the ending is fabulous. Why has Hollywood not made a movie out of it. I guess they are not interested in the concept of homelessness and want to avoid it. I am onto The Racketeer next. I listened to the audio book and the narrator is just on the spot. I really like listening to Grishmam's book on audio rather than reading them."
5,great book,"This was excellent book. I was caught up on the first page, and could not put the book down until I had finished it.If you like Grisham books, you will love this one."
2,If you love Grisham books STAY AWAY - What a waste of time,"This is a morality play under the guise of a novel. Hey John, stop the preaching and get back to writing gripping, lawyer stories.The premise is ludicrous. The thought of someone walking away from a million dollar a year job to work as a ""street lawyer"" is admirable but not one founded in reality. Don't you think this guy could have done a whole lot more by keeping his job and giving say, half a million a year to the legal clinic which could fund TEN lawyers?The only redeeming part of the book was the end where they finally reach a settlement. It's well written and clever. I wish the rest of the book was like this."
4,"Not the best, but still good","John Grsiham's novel The Street Lawyer was really good but it wasn't his best. The beginning was really exciting but then the story line died down. The parts describing the plight of the homeless were very intersting and informing. However, the case itself lacked excitement. I don't want to give it away, but the case this time did not have as much mystery and suspense as Gisham's earlier novels. Overall this book was definately worth reading but don't get your hopes."
2,Not up to par with his past publications,"Personally I was disappointed with this book. It seems that Mr. Grisham was at a low point or his editors were really pushing for a new novel. It's a decent quick read, but not the edge of your seat read like his past novels."
4,"Good, but not great. 1st half up, 2nd half down.","I read this book because it was a Grisham. I really enjoyed the 1st half but soon realized that there were few suprises left to be had. I think the book was most interesting, however, and felt that there is a learning experience there for everyone."
2,AWEFUL,"I've read all of Grisham's books an loved each and every one of them. The Street Lawyer is awful. It does not contain any of the drama, humor or catchy diologue that all of his others have. John, stick to what you do best: writing exiting books. If I want to read about morality and concience, I'll read my Bible!"
1,About a lawyer helping the homeless,"A lawyer name Michael who goes out and actually helps people that are less fortunate, (e.g. homeless). In the beginning, a homeless held him and some co-workers hostage. The S.W.A.T team had no choice but to take him out. Michael looked at the dead body and said to himself, ""Why?"" After that incident, he started to feel compassionate to homelesses on the street. He aslo works like 200 hrs/month, which averages to 50hrs/week. He is mainly devoted to his job and he totally neglects his wife. She is afraid that they might get into a divorce."
2,Plot seemed to be conjured up as he went along writing it,I believe John Grisham's main goal was to increase awareness in readers about homelesness in this novel so he just made a lame plot as the basis for this goal. First of all the level of the plot about Micheal stealing the file seemed to be just added for more action. If he didn't get in a car wreck his whole legal situation would not have existed. PLus the file was not really that necessary to the lawsuit to begin with.
3,A Book Only a Grisham Collector Could Love,"I read the reviews before the book, and I must admit to some skepticism. I have every John Grisham book. I still think The Firm was his best, but I thought The Partner was fantastic too. The Street Lawyer was an interesting book, but it should have been longer - make me care about the characters! And why not list some agencies that help the homeless? How much of the profits went to the homeless? Not his best."
2,Grisham can do better!,"I just finished the book and I think Grisham can do better! What is happening, low on ideas? I am a huge fan of his books, but this one was a little disapointing. I will give him another chance and continue reading his works. Hopefully the next will get better. Check out the Rainmaker and A Time to Kill if you are a first time Grisham reader."
4,"An interesting, intellectual, read.","John Grisham does it again with his premier release of 'The Street Lawyer'. I have to admit, it was the first novel I've ever finished in one day (Actually, I'm a pretty slow reader). One good thing about the novel was the ending wasn't like 'The Partner' (I guess Grisham realise it after reading all the reviews here about his crappy ending ^_^ ).The story of a lawyer on the road of fame and fortune, and then became a defender of the homeless is quite touching. I have to admit though, I agree with some of the other reviewers who said that the ending was a bit predictable (on the other hand, all novels' endings are predictable ^_-+ ). Nevertheless, it's good for those who wants to read about life on the streets of America and the injustice that was done upon them.Keep up the good work, Grisham. Please try to write something more 'gripping' and upbeat."
2,Next to Worst of Grisham novels,"I was dispointed by the political agenda that Grisham is beginning to object in his novels, and the intellectual intensity combined with some action is no longer in his plots. I felt like I should read an advertisement for the homeless and while notable I can do that without the help of a book. Still it was better than the Partner because I must have that at least somewhat optimistic ending."
3,Not the best.,"This is the second book I have read by John Grisham. I have read the partner, which I found hard to follow. This one I read in two days. Everybody seems to be slating it, but it isn't that bad. John Grisham has obviously done a great deal of research into this novel and a lot of it is very interesting and educational, but the story does seem a bit weak. successful lawyer on his way to be partner hits crisis turns to help the good of the people. Perhaps worth reading, perhaps not. I think I'll try the Firm."
2,Really disappointing,"I've read every Grisham book to date and this is by far the most disappointing. I kept waiting for the Grisham magic to kick in, but the story just limped from one chapter to the next. The basic story was ok, but the Author would have done well to keep this at novella length. I'll read the next, but Grisham's on probation in my book!"
2,Definitely not up to Grisham's hard hitting past thrillers.,"John Grishman is my favorite author and this is the first one of his books that I have not thoroughly enjoyed. It lacks suspense that Grisham's past books have all contained. He chose to have a young woman with children to carry forth his story line probably knowing that he would find little sympathy for any other characters. John Grisham's past books have all been filled with suspense and difficult situations for his leading characters, yet this book contains very little story line to hold the readers attention. I have not recommended this book to anyone."
2,Grisham is getting lazy...,"Boy, am I disappointed. Grisham proved he could write well with ""A Time to Kill"" and ""The Pelican Brief."" Now he's fallen into some sort of plot trap that he can't seem to get rid of. Brilliant young lawyer becomes disillusioned with legal profession, gets in trouble, and shacks up with someone at the end. If you've read ""The Client,"" then you know exactly how this book is going to play out by page 40. And he even managed to abridge the plot from ""The Client."" I guess I'm going to have to look for another source for legal thrillers because this one bored me to tears."
1,I was thoroughly disappointed,"I have read every book that John Grisham has ever written and this one will be my last if the rest are like the Street Lawyer. When I finished the book I wondered why I even took the time to read it. The story had no depth to it whatsoever. I hope John got the ""bad one"" out of his system and gets back to writing what he is good at."
2,boring!,"There was no suspense, no build up to the plot. I didnt care one bit about the hero. Grisham needs to stop trying to put out a bk every 8 months and take the time to write a well thought out bk. He could have done great things with this plot. At 27.95 the bk is terribly overpriced unless proceeds are going to help the homeless he writes about."
1,WHO CARES??,"I've read most of Mr. Grisham's book, and in my opinion, only A TIME to KIll stands by itself as a decent piece of literature. I wouldn't waste my precious reading time with an author who writes banal, predictable screenplays only to sell out to the highest bidder. Mr. Grisham should either become a movie producer or simply spend more time on his precious baseball diamond which he built for his son anyway."
3,Grisham - as always.,"Grisham's latest lawyer book, The Street Lawyer, though good if you are a new Grisham reader, runs through the same style and pace as always found. Thus if you have read the full set: Firm, Chamber, Runaway Jury, Partner, the storylines all merge into one - and this latest plot is guessable after the second chapter. However, it is a good book if you have not read all the others."
1,Sanctimonious and shallow,"The characters in this novel are undeveloped, there is no plot, the denouement consists of a settlement conference where a totally predictable negotiation takes place. Grisham seems to have gone ""slumming"" and discovered that some people are homeless through no fault of their own. He may even have talked to someone who actually talked to them. The only parts of this novel which sound like he knows what he's talking about are the repeated worries about being in a bad neighborhood with a good car. I wonder how much of the money he earns from this preachy, obnoxious book Grisham will donate to the people whose situations he exploits?If this were a first novel, it would be laughed out of any self-respecting agent's office."
1,boo,this is one of his worst. along with his non fiction book innocent man this was nothing more than a political statement. a time to kill is by far his best
1,"Could Something Suck More, Please?","This book feels like the author had 300 pages to fill, but only 30 pages of material. And an axe to grind...because he just discovered there were homeless people in the world. It certainly follows a formula, but does so poorly and without enthusiasm.This is the first and last Grisham book I will read.P.S. I put ""one star"" because they don't have a negative star rating."
1,The Street Lawyer,"I only read this book because I knew that it would be a quick read, and it didn't disappoint there. The book is preachy, and just down right silly in some parts. It ends with a very mellow dramatic and anti climatic ending. Unless you need something to read and the air sickness bag just won't cut it, sure, go for it...otherwise, buy a magazine, or just move on -- don't read this...it seemed as though he had a great idea for a novel, but then ran into a deadline."
5,"The Street Lawyer, an epic novel","This is the best book I've every read. It displays Grishams intellect and pure skill in writing. This is a must have, the best book ever written."
2,My Grocery List Is More Interesting Read,"I just can't believe that John Grisham is a major player in current fiction scene and is considered to be in the same league with Tom Clancy and Stephen King (though I don't like horror stories at all but at least SK knows how to form a sentence).I have read all JG's books and the only ones I enjoyed were ""The Chamber "" and ""The Rainmaker"". His worst book ever, to me, was ""The Partner"" and the ""Street Lawyer"" could be a hot contender for that position had it not been for the subject which I found thought provoking (that's why 2 stars). It seems that JG has run out of ideas (which were never abundant to him in the first place) but his books are at least serving one purpose i.e. we have one less lawyer to worry about.Sorry Mr. Grisham, but from now-onwards, you are on my ""borrow only"" authors list.Rafi"
1,Same old story line with different setting,"I regret that I could not finish this documentary-novel. I simply gave up half way into the book. While I empathize with those who are homeless, and I think our society does have a problem, Grisham has taken the cause too far in novel form. To make a long story short, it is boring. His writing is flat and the character developent falls short. Within 50 pages the protagonist tells all, almost dies, and makes a major life change. None of these events makes one identify with him because of the verbage. I don't think Grisham is a good writer but he sells books. He definitely needs a new start or a good writing course."
1,Implausible Stinkaroo!!!,"To affirm many of the reviews, this one is a stinkeroo! Totally implausible (K street lawyer gets epiphamy? Ha!) Stilted writing contributes to a hardback which I will actually trash. And I NEVER throw away books! Linnette Garber, Bethesda, Maryland lawyer."
1,A disappointing read - exploitation of the homeless.,"This book tries to make the main character - a lawyer - a ""savior"" among the homeless. I read the credits at the end thanking several people - he should have donated all profits to the homeless - instead of using them to finance his own greed. I kept thinking through the entire book - no way would this lawyer do this - this story is a joke! I live in the city and see homeless on a daily basis - he should quit writing and use his $$ for something useful!"
1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Finished,"I must admit I did finish this book (I have a bad habit of finishing what I start---including incredibly bad novels). Please someone tell Mr. Grisham that if he has nothing to say that he shouldn't feel obliged to put out a new book ever year. Or--someone tell his agent. I could care less about the homeless, but if the author had something to say, I could still enjoy a piece of fiction about the subject. This book is bad--REALLY bad."
4,Good book,"It is a good, easy read. It made me look at myself and the homeless population much different (I even started volunteering at my local missions. I really enjoyed reading this book."
4,Morals and Ethics of Lawyers,"While this not Grisham's best work, I think this is definitely worth the read, especially for all those out there that question lawyer ethics.The story is about a young lawyer, Michael Brock, who has a terrifying experience at his wealthy law firm with a homeless person. The experience leaves Michael searching for more meaning to life than hourly billings, power lunches, big bonuses and high paychecks. Michael also finds out a secret about his firm, and when he leaves the firm to help the homeless, he takes it with him. The story picks up the pace from there, with astonishing actions on the part of Michael, as well as his former employers.For anyone who thinks lawyers are the scum of the earth, this story may not set things right, but it will show that there are people who care in this world."
2,I am disappointed......could be better......,"I've read all of John Grisham's books, ""The Street Lawyer"" is not in the same caliber as ther other earlier books written by the author. The author could make it more exciting, but the story didn't get into any kind of climax at all. I liked John's idea of helping the homeless, but that is the only thing I liked about this book. As a fan of John Grisham's book, I expect better books from him."
2,Could've been better,"As an ardent reader of legal fiction and a dedicated fan of Mr. Grisham's writing, I was very disappointed with this book. The main character, Michael Brock, was unbelievable and predictably swayed toward the PC social commentary depicted in this novel. Some characters were very well done (ie. Mordecai Greene and Ruby, the addict). In fact, I cared more for them than the story's protagonist. The first few chapters were wonderful, but the story declined from there as Brock began his downward spiral into the dregs of society. Also, the courtroom battle lacked any strong energy or interesting characters, as found in The Runaway Jury or The Rainmaker. Read this book in paperback form. It's not worth the hardcover price. Sorry, John."
2,Waiting for a plot to change,"Although the characters described by Grisham rise the expectations at the beginning of the book, the plot just won't change for the better. The story is heart warming and well written, but it was not a story I expected to come from John Grisham."
2,A total snooze fest.,"I have read all of John Grisham's books and this was by far the worst. The story had a good premise but John Grisham didn't deliver in this one. If you have never read a Grisham don't let this be your first, you may not read another."
4,A Good Read,"While this is not the best of the Grisham novels I have read, this was not a bad novel. It was very interesting, entertaining and a pleasurable read. While it did not get into real depth, it raised some issues and concerns that the overall public refuse to bring to light.After everything that happened in the beginning of the book, you would think that Claire and his family would be a little more concerned about his well being and his incident. I think those characters were shallow. But, as background characters, their purpose was served. This book is about Michael's revelations and Michael's personal growth.Easy read, interesting and I would recommend it to anyone as a quick read."
5,One of his Best!!,"I read this book over a weekend and have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it! I even liked it as much as The Client, which is my favorite Grisham book. It also has a lesson on ethics within it. We live in a very materialistic society and after reading this book, you really think the next time you buy a shirt at Macy's or go out for dinner and drinks with friends. Not everyone can have these luxuries in life and many of us spend more on a smoothie or coffee from Starbucks than some spend on a meal. It would be a perfect book to tie in with The Lifestyle Makeovers you see on Oprah.That wasn't the only part of the book, though. I did have plenty of law related things as all of his books do. If you enjoy his other books, I am sure you will like this one as well. I know I did!!"
2,Nope!,Didn't like this one at all. the beginning was interesting but it went downhill repidly after that. WE want the old Grisham!
1,I Wanted to Like It,"This was the first Grisham book I read. I had heard so many good things about Grisham and wanted to like it. Unfortunately, I found the characters unbelievable and the plot implausible. Maybe it's just me, but I find it hard to believe that a Lawyer who was on his way to becoming partner would throw it all away. I found myself screaming ""Schmuk! Take the money!"""
2,unrealistic,"This book grabs you with suspense in the beginning but thats about all it does. It becomes to repetitive with the meeting soul searching as to why he wants to devote his life to helping the homeless. The homeless as described in this book are portrayed as if they were victims of the stock market crash. I am a law enforcement officer in New York City for over twenty seven years and the homeless I have come to met are not how Mr.Grisham portrays his homeless. Mr. Grisham's other books may be bestsellers, but I would only recommend this book to someone who wanted to read a quick book ."
1,Social Issue Lecture?,I read the first 125 pages and believe me I had to struggle and force myself to get that far. I finally gave up. This was not an entertaining book as other Grisham novels. I had just finished the Confession which was also a lecture on another social issue. I do not want to be lectured on social issues when I'm trying to read a thriller. I will defintely be more careful before I buy another Grisham novel.
2,DIDN'T LIKE IT. Audiobook,"JG was trying to make a social statement.I read fiction for fun, not for social commentary.Even though the book was bad. The ending was worse.Most JG endings are flat."
2,irrelevant points,"I was rather surprised to see how boring this book can get. It has a great plot and the beginning is quite good. But after you get through the middle it's hard to keep reading. The author seems to have such a great obsession with telling the reader about what's legal and what's not that it got to a point it was hard to stick with getting through the book. The only reason I read it till the end was to see how the law suit would end up. Which was, rather predictible."
1,A boring and long-winded sermon.,"Grisham has gotten tired. This book has none of the well-crafted plot twists and turns that made his early books exciting. After the opening ""drama"" which takes up the first few chapters, nothing much happens. And the book is preachy. Grisham has a sermon for us, namely that we should help the homeless. It is clear that the only reason he wrote the book is to give this sermon. And he hammers us over the head with it for several hundred pages."
1,Last Grisham I'll ever read,"Somewhere along the line, Mr. Grisham toppled off his storytelling ladder deciding that the social statement was a more compelling exercise than the entertainment of his readers. I suppose we should have been forewarned with his recent engagements with the tobacco and insurance industries, but our continued purchases in hopes of another 'Firm' or 'Client' seems to have stimulated him to continue in this (moralizing) direction. Surely, the pharmaceutical industry is next, followed by professional sports then Bill Gates and company. If you revel in moralizing lecture/statements on (name the subject), you'll want to read this and all subsequent Grisham books. Me, I prefer stories and entertainment. I'm sticking with P.D. James, Louise Erdrich, Larry Bond and Patrick OBrian. I want my money back."
1,Grisham gets big bucks to exploit the homeless.,"John Grisham should be ashamed to be paid so much to write such drivel about the poor and homeless! A subject that is rich diggings for a more informed and talented writer, this book should be an embarassment to both author and publisher. It is a shallow attempt to create a story out of human misery and it fails because of a lack of talent and knowledge of the subject."
1,only the name of author got this book published.,"If anyone besides John Grisham approached a publisher with such a piece of trivial nonsense, they would of promptly (and rightfully so) been laughed out of the building. The shame is that Grisham picked a good format to write about but never gave the reader anything to hold their interest. He had the start of a really good book,but never developed his characters into ""people"" - only mannequins! Please, next time give me another ""A Time to Kill"" or ""The Firm"". Helen Pate (hpate@clnk.com)"
2,Thin plot and a quick ending.,"It seemed to me to be one of those books that ran over schedule and had to be completed quickly. The ending was a little ""and they lived happily ever after""-ish."
3,It was an average book by Grisham.,It is a well written book but I suggest the Partner for the max suspence.
2,Tyler Comans,"Street Lawyer is an excellent book that has a beginning that really grasps your interest and holds that interest all the way through the novel. Any ways its a legal story about a big-shot lawyer from Washington DC that involves love, lust, betrayal, murder, mystery, deceit, suspense, romance and sex galore. This is a fast read just like all of John Grisham's novel, which makes them great novels."
3,lukewarm,"I've read all the Grisham books. His first 2, ""A Time To Kill"" and ""The Firm"" were the best. Unknowingly, he probably set the bar too high with these two books. I wonder if that rawness that many artists have early in their careers has disappeared in Grisham. In ""Street"" he grabs you in the beginning, tells a pretty good story, but ultimately disappoints. Again, relative to those gripping tales earlier. That said, John Grisham remains my favorite writer. I look forward to 1999 and his regaining that early edge."
3,"Not as good as some, not as bad as others","This is a very fast read, not as good as ""A time to kill"", not as bad as ""The Runawaw Jury"". His soapbox is getting worn out. I never felt good about the main character, and I thought the ending was kind of silly. I think the SWAT team killed the wrong person."
2,"Fine for killing time on a 5-hr flight, but mostly boring...","Grisham's ""The Street Lawyer"" won't keep you turning the pages with excitement like his earlier novels (""The Firm"", ""The Pelican Brief""). There's not a whole lot of suspense, fear, or emotion in this novel -- the main character has an epiphany that leads him to leave his high-paying, power law firm for a street clinic, helping out the homeless with their legal problems -- not the stuff of a thriller. To be sure, there's some contrived tension arising from some shady characters threatening physical violence and the hope that you're still reading The Firm. But the story mostly just unfolds and then gets resolved. At least the main character doesn't end up living in Aruba at the end of this story :-)For true Grisham fans (and I'm one of them), it's a quick and easy read that you might as well add to your collection, but it won't leave you talking about it the next day like many of his other novels..."
1,Even Worse than The Partner,"I really liked John Grisham books, until i read the boring ""The Partner"". Now, his latest is even worse. If you want a documentary about homeless people - you get just that. But if you want some twists and turns, or even a story - don't waste any time or money on this book."
1,where is butch karp when we need him?,"Lets kill all the lawyers, and to perdition wish them, street lawyer is just ""more of the same"" it's cookie cutter grisham. a yuppie sheds some tears and gives up his pricey jobby oh mr. grisham please stop now, give up writing as a hobby. i'm sorry to write this review, my trashing was so thorough, i'll get the bad taste taken away, read Tanenbaum and Turow. THUMBS DOWN!!"
2,dissapointing to say the least,"this book had some good points but they were certainly outnumbered by bad points. his previous book i thought were all exceptional. But this latest effort seemed less like a suspense driven novel and more like a political campaign saying that ""i really am a nice guy"". i hope his next book will be as good as his prevous seven."
1,Grisham at his worst!,"As a huge fan of author John Grisham, I must be honest in my attempt to sway those interested in spending some time with The Street Lawyer. Very simply: Don't!Mr Grisham has chosen an entertainment forum for his views, however noble, on the plight of the homeless. It does not work.Save yourself time (and money) and chose something, anything else for your reading pleasures."
1,"A wasting of money, time and effort..","My friend gave me that book and I, as usual, eager to start a new reading on a fresh book. But, I'm so dissapointed when I can't find my courage to keep on reading as the plot is very slow and unlogical. Same as The Rainmaker, I don't suggest it to any of my friends and it totally wasting money, time and effort you put into it.."
2,"Starts off with a BANG, ends with a YAWN","Like many of the other comments, I really thought The Street Lawyer started off great. But, it went downhill from then on. So many of Grishams books are page turners and this one was definetly not. This book could of had so much potential. It was a good plot, but just didn't keep my attention."
1,Pure trash,"Grisham has really sold out, on this one.Now I know why best selling authors don't win anything!"
2,fair,This is probably my 6th Grisham book. I was somewhat disappointed. It was interesting at the beginning and his writing was good. But there was such minimal plot! It started sounding a little preachy. Needs to get back to courtroom lawyering for his characters.
1,Not his best work,I was very dissappointed in this latest work I have read everthing he has written and I feel that he just wrote this book to write a book When I got finished reading this book I felt like I had been cheated. It felt like I never really knew the characters.
3,Not of his best work,"John Grisham has make us feel secure that every book we get from him, it would be a no-put-down and thrilling book, and hoping to see the movie to laugh at all the details missing. This book does not, at some times it gets a little easy-to-put-down. I am still waiting for his next book and that he'll return to his status."
4,Feel the world of Homeless,Though the book gives the depth of understanding the way the life of the homeless people live . more emphasis should have been on courtroom settlements in lieu out of court ones.overall the book was good.can be read
1,Glad I didn't pay for it,"While I am a true lover of Grisham book, this one was terrible. It was slow, anticlimatic, and just flat out dragged on. The story lacked in excitement and was overburdened with sentimental details about the homeless. I want the courtroom excitement of a Time to Kill, the suspense and legal strategies of the Partner, the Firm, and the Pelican Brief. I am just glad I borrowed this book rather than paying for it."
4,Street Smarts,"John Grisham has done it again. And this time with a very important moral message. In, ""The Street Lawyer"", we meet Micahel Brock. A young aspisring attorney in the dizzy fast paced world of billing hours & large firm politics.When Michael goes out into the streets, he is faced with reality at its worst. As he overcomes his fears, he becomes a true fighter for social causes. He even takes on his old firm. And they just might want to eliminate him.In my opinion, one of Grishams best since his first, ""A Time To Kill"".Thanks -- CDS"
2,"Utterly predictable, not worth the money","Another example of people blaming others for their state in life. Fine, the plight of poor, homeless people is deplorable but don't go blaming rich folks (whoever those are) for that. The book spends so much time blaming the rich (and the govt) for the homeless situation in DC while ignoring the fact that these homeless people, in most cases, brought it upon themselves. For example, a character in the book called Ruby consistently kept relapsing into drug abuse despite all Michael Brock's efforts. However, instead of blaming her, Grisham does not. Besides, if I bust my butt working (no one can deny the fact that even lawyers at Drake & Sweeny work as hard, maybe harder, as every other person), why should I be made to feel guilty about someone who spends every dollar he/she gets on drugs and alcohol? Finally, I think Grisham will do us all a favor if he returns to his law practice instead of turning out books like this."
2,JUST WHAT I EXPECTED-QUICK AND VERY LIGHT.,"EVEN with the attempt of a heavy story, this book fails to envoke emotion on a subject that deserves a harder look. typical Grisham, the writing flows, is easy to follow and can be finished during dinner. The book builds up and but doesn't have a major conclusion, not a lot of excitement and no empathy for the main character. In The Firm, my heart was racing, in the The Street Lawyer-nothing. It is not a bad book and I will probably continue to read his novels, but this is one of his weaker stories."
2,"After The Firm and A Time To Kill, its been all down hill.","Its funny what a writer can do when he's is a struggling writer/artist.Many of Grishams stories have aspects which are a bit farfetched, but the notion that a 120,000$ lawyer would leave his practice so suddenly to work with the poor is ludicrous. This book ,although readable, is Grisham's worst. I guess he had to pump a novel out in record time. We may have seen the best of Grisham 5-6 books ago!!!!!!"
4,The Best Grisham I've read,"This wasn't about courtrooms and leagalese to the point of choking, but it was the best Grisham since ""A Time to Kill"". The issues were the theme, and how a person has to live with him/her self. Too often this is forgotten. Thanks for the reminder"
1,Liberal Trash,"I am (or should say I was) a huge Grisham Fan. To date, I have read all of his books and had enjoyed most. I purchased ""The Street Lawyer"" the week it was released with anticipation of an interesting yarn. I think I made it to page 100 or so...I could not stomach it any further. This book was the whiniest, liberal, elitest, republican bashing trash I had ever come across. PLEASE, if we want to hear someone's liberal social commentary, we can watch CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, or read the New York Times. I read books to get away from this crap, not receive more of it.Just to be fair, I should mention I gave ""The Street Lawyer"" a second chance. While traveling, I rented an audio book copy...again, I couldn't stomach it past the first side of the first tape."
2,Terrible,"I read for entertainment, not to be lectured for 400+ pages....by far the worst of all Grisham novels."
2,Disappointed,"Not worth keeping in my bookshelf. Weak story, and Grisham seems to becoming more predictable with his stories. Traditional drawn-out Grisham style, but with no substance. I already have doublt about his new one, The Testament. Let's pray Hollywood will leave Street Lawyer alone !"
2,Now I understand why it was given to me,"I'm a non-native English speaker. One day the Congressman I worked for gave this book to me, he was cleaning his shelves, and said it would be good to improve my English. Now I understand. It is not more than a good thesaurus."
1,Could have done more!,I've read them all but I doubt I will be very anxious to pay for another unless Mr. Grisham spends more time developing his characters and plot. Tom Clancy does too much and I won't give him another try. Scott Turow beats these two hands down.
4,Love the Street Lawyer,"People go back and forth on this book the main argument is: John Grisham wrote a parable about a man who does good for the poor. If you want to read an inspirational, heart warming, a little preachy legal thriller, read this. If you don't want to, don't read this."
2,Where's Grisham's Action and amazing plot???,"Grisham's latest is not Grisham at his best. Thinking of previous books whith amazing twists and turns in the story, I found The Street Lawyer BORING. The story about the young ambitious lawyer that sees the light was not much more to me than a long story to get the space between front and back cover filled. No plot, no emotion, no action.Grisham can and should do better. Looking forward to another classic like The Partner, The Chamber or The Firm."
3,It was fairly good.,"This is the first Grisham book I have ever read. It really kept me interested at first, but then the interest started to die off. I needed some romance, or some type of conflict on the side. The beginning was very well written though."
4,very good!,This book was very well written. The story and the plot is a very good one but I agree with the others that it could have been better if John had taken more time to write it. Over all I really recommend this book to anyone.
3,Something Missing,"As usual, Grishams books are very entertaining. However, there seemed to be a spark missing in this write. He needed more intrique. He also skirted any association with the state of affairs in the District, which is deplorable, with the Mayor and the people of his administration. Successful white makes were once again responsible. Ohum."
1,Embarrassingly preachy with lousy character development,"This is a book of ""one-ness."" Single dimension characters, one tedious and labored theme, and a singularly misplaced responsiblity. Washington DC's homeless problem is blamed on 1) the Republicans (and specifically, Newt), 2) the rich (specifically, the educated rich), and the fact that ""Washington, DC just doesn't work."" Not once in his heavy-handed preaching did Grisham mention the word, ""Barry."" I didn't give this a ""1"" out of loyalty for his real books."
1,"Run, don't walk out of the bookstore!!!","Grisham seems to be more interested in concepts than good stories. His writing has gradually deteriorated since ""the Firm."" Even the concept of this book is lame: big city lawyer chucks in all away to help the homeless. Did Grisham write this because he feels guilty making big bucks from movie deals?"
1,A half-hour sitcom vs mini-series,"Unfortunately, John Grisham has undoubtedly been led down the path to commercialism. His first few books were very good. This one lacked character development, it was like he had a predetermined page count to fill while his agent and publisher were in the next room with a stop watch. This book was like watching a half hour sitcom vs the mini series I was hoping for. Thumbs down"
3,Good but missing the courtroom drama,"I enjoyed this one better than The Partner, which seemed to be written as a script for a movie. I didn't like it as much as some of his earlier work, like the Rainmaker. I kept expecting a big courtroom scene (I felt the book led me in that direction) and 2/3rd of the way thru, realized there wouldn't be one. Grisham still writes better than most, but I wish he would get back to the drama and thrills of his earlier work. Snappy courtroom drama. Plot twists. Not write a script or wrap it up so tidily. Granted, this was better than The Partner in the script aspect. My two cents... Will still definitely buy his books..."
1,"Worst book he ever wrote, very disappointed",After the Chamber I thought it could not get any worse....I was wrong! I do not understand why someone with so much talent for good stories and real plots have to try for a social stand. THAT IS NOT WHY WE BUY YOUR BOOKS JOHN.I have enjoyed and bought every book written by Grisham but think that in the future I may wait for the paperback and read a few reviews first.I was very disappointed and quit reading the book (first time ever!) after about 2/3rds of the way through it. It did not even interest me enough to finish the story.
1,"Boring and ""worthy"" Grisham","Grisham's latest is such a disappoinment, it feels almost unlikely that this is the same man who wrote ""A time to kill"", ""The Firm"", and ""The Partner"", all of which were great thrillers. This one isn't. It reads like a boring textbook on the downside of the American society, or to be more spesific, all the homeless. Grisham seems obsessed with passing the blame and in the process he actually forgets to write a good book. His characters are embarrassing stereotypes and the story just doesn't cut it. Although the cause is more than worthy the novel suffers from being just that, ""worthy"", when it should have neen exiting and thrilling. The book strikes me a something of a ""first draft"" that should've been given a lot more work before being allowed to be published. Better luck the next time....."
4,Grisham Takes on Homelessness,"John Grisham basically writes two types of novels: legal thrillers where a young lawyer takes on the mob, or courtroom dramas where a young lawyer takes on large corporations. I prefer the courtroom dramas. True, Grisham can get heavy-handed at times with the morals of his novels, but in THE STREET LAWYER, he combines his moralizing with believable and likable characters, something that was missing in THE PARTNER. The last chapter can be taken two ways: either as pure fantasy, or as Grisham's reminder of the good effects huge law firms could create if they would unleash their associates as advocates for the homeless and other disenfranchised members of American society."
3,Not his best work but still made me think!,"The first few chapters of this latest Grisham novel really held my interest, the story started out with some real action and I was ready to sit down for a nice long read of Grisham. But...it didn't happen. Half way through I thought it just HAD to get better, some twists and turns, surprises, would develop...but it just came to the predictable end. However, the social issue of the homeless stayed with me. Ironically, I have just returned from D.C. for a visit with my daughter and I saw these people in a different light. I had hardly noticed them before. Even though this certainly isn't his greatest novel to date, it did bring something more than just a good read to my attention. There certainly are stong opinions one way or the other on this novel, either you hate it (0) or you love it (10). Nevertheless, we will still be eager for the next work of this most acclaimed author. (My favorite also is ""A Time to Kill"", his first and best writing."
4,Eye-opener,"Though, I am not quite finished with the book, I have to say that it definitely has made me more aware of the homeless situation in our country. It has compassion and sensitivity. I don't understand how some readers could have given this book such a low rating. Granted it is not the best of his novels, however, Grisham has tried to open our eyes to a growing problem here in the U.S. It was not a waste of my time to borrow it from the library, and I agree with one critic, that the book would make a great curriculm-integrated book in the 8th-12th grade Social Studies classes. Keep the novels coming,John."
3,Sullivan's Travels,"Very disappointing. For a thriller, it lacks the thrills, twists and an interesting story and for a novel about the homeless it is much, much to shallow. The homeless are still an anonymus mass and the characters which he tries to flesh out are so shallow that you don't care about them too much. Maybe Grisham had good intentions, but this novel doesn't do justice to the homeless. Dear Mr. Grisham, if you or one of your agents/lawyers does read this, take this advice from me: Go to a videostore and rent the movie: ""Sullivan's Travels"" by Preston Sturges. Why? Watch it. You'll know why. Review by Oliver Naujoks, Marburg/Germany"
3,Maybe Grisham shouldn't crank out a new book every year,"I was very disappointed in this book. It had no substance, the characters were weak and it just didn't cut it for me. I usually like Grisham books, but this one was too plain."
1,Tiresome leftist propoganda,"The Street Lawyer is Grisham's worst book. It appears he wrote it as a way of relieving his 'guilt' for being a successful wealthy writer. As usual, the Republicans (Reagan and 'Newt') are blamed for all of the ills of society and anyone with money obtained it by taking advantage of the poor and downtrodden. Don't waste your time with this tiresome book."
5,Great Story!,"John Grisham covers an issue that few people want to admit exists! This was a verythought provoking story. I could not put this one down until I finished....and then when I did, the reality of it can not be forgotten."
2,"Not a waste of time, but close","I have enjoyed Grisham books in the past but this was well below his average. I would rate A TIME TO KILL his best and THE CHAMBER his worst. The book did make you assess how lucky you may be and whether you do enough to help others less fortunate, but the hero's quick switch was unbelievable. The resolution was also unbelievable. Does Grisham really believe that there are no bad guys? Pollyanna lives."
2,Disappointing,"Grisham is one of the few authors I pick up his book the day it comes out before the reviews are in. Unfortunately with this one I wished I had waited. It seems like every other book of his is good. Chamber was his worst, Rainnmaker was good, Runaway Jury boring, The Partner was good, now Street Lawyer. The common theme is when he tries to preach his books fall apart. There was nothing suspenseful about this latest effort. I could have cared less how it ended up. The best thing about this book was the print is big, the margins wide and thus it didnt take very long to read. The misery was over with in short order."
2,Left me kinda empty,"Just when I thought there was reason to cheer--a new John Grisham book--I read it. Although it did keep me enthralled as I was reading it, I can't honestly say that I liked it too much. It's a page turner, but it leaves you feeling kind of hollow. But I may just be biased. I read an interview somewhere in which Grisham said that he didn't like writing, but he liked being a published author. Speaking as a writer who loves to write and has yet to be published, may I suggest to Mr. Grisham that he seriously rethink his career if he really doesn't like the work--and let someone who has a more original idea step forward for a little glory?"
2,REALLY wanted to like the book!,"As much as I wanted to I just couldn't. This is terrible. As MANY others have said, this is a soap box. Mr. Grisham does an okay job of making you aware of the homeless problem in D.C. but come on, did it need 350 pages. Add a helping of plot and a couple of sprinkles of good character and another hundred pages to get the mix just right and you might have had a story worth reading. I venture a guess that with one more like this one and we won't be hearing the name John Grisham anymore. That would be a shame considering how he started out with A Time To Kill and The Firm. Put a little more than a month into the next one Mr. Grisham. Most of us really enjoyed them when you did."
1,Could it be any slower?,"I am a fan of John Grishams books but this one? The first 50 pages were excellent then it just stops. I started reading it in November and still have 150 more pages to go - I took it with me to the ER to read where I spent 5 hours, I knew I had no other choice but to read this book and that's why I am on page 300 now.I don't see the purpose of describing each and every client in detail that walks into the main characters office.Honestly - it's a waste of time, but it will not stop me from reading and buying more of Grishams books."
3,Grisham's only dog!,"It appears to me that John Grisham needed a paycheck. I read the entire book quickly, and enjoyed it, but it seems unrealistic and uncharacteristic of Grisham's excellent writing style. I find the use of Washington, D.C. as the locale trite and unimaginative. Grisham's work is so good, that this ends up seeming mediocre, at best!"
3,"Same Grisham, Different Plot","True to his form, Grisham has churned out yet another page turner that's hard to put down. As far as the plot itself goes, however, The Street Lawyer is far less compelling than some of his previous works. That's not to say that the premise isn't interesting: the story begins with the shooting of a homeless man and is centered around the money of the rich trampling on the rights of the poor. It's the intricacies of the plot twists that make it hard to feel satisfied. Much of the drama centers around one stolen file, the suspense around victims who are already dead, and the side plot around a lawyer trying to save a drug addict.Nevertheless, Grisham keeps you reading. Don't know how he does it - but once he's got you into one of his books, you'll be hooked. As such, it's a bearable way to pass the time and stay awake."
1,Not a thriller; a trite political screed,"Grisham clearly is tired of writing thrillers and is trying to branch out into social activism. Just like his earlier book on capital punishment, this exploration of the politics of homelessness is a tiresome read."
1,"Very lame, poor attempt by Grisham.","This book reeks of something written merely to capitalize on Grisham's popularity in order to make money. Poor plot, poorly written. A waste of time and money."
1,What were you thinking?,"When i heard that there was another book out by John, well i was kind of excited, but after the first part of the book i was getting bored and dumbfounded by the how the story was going. This needs to be a learning experience to all. Next time you write a book like this , please put a warning label on it so we will be warned at least."
1,A bleeding heart story of all the saintly homeless people.,I have enjoyed all of Grisham's books (and have read them all) except this one. The plot was predictable and uninteresting. This book tells me that all homeless people are saints and victims of greedy rich people. It was one big sob story. What a boring disappointment!!!
1,Awful!,I literally forced myself to stick with it and finish the book. Not even close in quality and content to his other books. Future books better improve or Mr Grisham will have a lot more time to devote to his baseball field and little league programs.
3,Made me sleepy,"This is only the second Grisham novel Ive read(the Firm being the first)and I have to say,the Street Lawyer was disappointing.The beginning was promising,but it slid downwards gradually from there.The ending was too tidy and perfect,while the middle was boring.There wasn't enough action or suspense,or anything really.However,the book did give me some insight into the world of the homeless,but it was too preachy for my taste.Ill try A Time to kill,which seems to be getting better reviews."
2,This might be the last John Grisham book i buy,"I've read all of Grisham's books so far and liked them a lot, so i was looking forward to reading this one. But it wasn't any good! The story is so thin and moralizing it made me sick. A bad rich lawyer turns to morally correct poor lawyer with a complete new set of values within a week. The story is so predictable and it gets really boring after the first 30 pages. Bye bye, mister Grisham."
5,Really Great Book,"Last year I picked this book up knowing it had to be as good as the other Grishams. But I couldn't finish because I needed to keep up with my schoolwork. This year, I picked up again. IT WAS AMAZING! Grisham wrote another masterpiece here. It brings a very important issue into Grisham's novels. Before I read this, I had never known there was a such thing as a street lawyer."
3,"Interesting, informative but no thrill","John Grisham did his good deed and let the world know about a struggling yet important segment of the legal profession and the impoverished souls that they help. I will look up the local organization of street lawyers and consider adding them to my list of charities that I give to each year.Other than that, it was a bit boring."
3,A Cadbury Egg for the mind,"The main character's behavior is incredible, likewise the redemptive ending. The lines of good and evil are rather simplistically drawn (though there are more cases of clear-cut abuse against the poor in real life than most people would like to realize.) There are no sentences that blow you away with sheer poetry, nor any deep insights into the nature of man and the cosmos. All this is a is a viscerally satisfying white-hats vs. black-hats legal thriller. Sometimes, as when you are stuck with your in-laws for a week, that's all you really need. Though it's not my usual style, I genuinely enjoyed this little book."
4,Makes ya think though,"Previous Grisham novels may have been more captivating and exciting but, none made me ponder what I take for granted. I found it enjoyable throughout...obviously, the first 50 pages are more intense than the rest. I have to admit I preferred other books but, none makes me think more about sociey.....even weeks after finishing. I don't see how anyone could not finish the book in less than a few days. It has to be one of his shortest works."
3,street lawyer,"Paper-thin characters populate Grisham's legal story about a big-shot Washington DC lawyer who finds a conscience and becomes an advocate for the city's homeless. The plot is a predictable formulaic story of, yawn, personal redemption and reexamining one's prejudices. The author seems to wear his own preconceptions a little too close to the surface when he repeatedly reveals his own latent racism and fear of the poor. The book is a page-turner in a pop novel sort of way, but if you think you've figured out the ending about halfway through, well, you have. No need to read further."
3,Not Much There,"Paper-thin characters populate Grisham's legal story about a big-shot Washington DC lawyer who finds a conscience and becomes an advocate for the city's homeless. The plot is a predictable formulaic story of, yawn, personal redemption and reexamining one's prejudices. The author seems to wear his own preconceptions a little too close to the surface when he repeatedly reveals his own latent racism and fear of the poor. The book is a page-turner in a pop novel sort of way, but if you think you've figured out the ending about halfway through, well, you have. No need to read further."
2,Hmmmm.......,"After reading the previous books.... I was a little let down by this one. It was a good story, just not exciting... And way too long for this subject.However, out of respect for Grisham, I finished it. Not that it wasn't interesting, but I would rather have read something else.Anyway, don't expect anything massively exciting from this one."
4,Worth the read...,"I consider The Street Lawyer among Grisham's better works. It is a quick read that maintains its pace throughout.A near-death experience prompts a lawyer, on the fast track to making partner [becoming rich and living out all his dreams] to give it all away in search of a more meaningful existence. Ok, so it sounds like a made-for-tv movie. Well, it's well written and quite believable. Unlike his other books, which build up to what is usually a letdown ending, this one maintains an even pace and leaves you more satisfied when the last page comes.Some may not appreciate the somewhat different style, but I personally liked the book and think you will too."
4,Worth Reading,"""The Street Lawyer"" is a page turner just like all the rest of Grisham's novels, but the story is far less complex than what I normally expect from him. I still greatly enjoyed reading it though.Many who read the book and posted reviews here found the central character's (Michael Brock) sudden change of lifestyle and career path to be unbelievable. Personally, I did not think so. If the incident with Mister at the beginning were the only motivator, I might think the same. However, I viewed that incident as an 'eye opener' for Brock. He was not a happy man, and he finally realized that he needed to do something about that. Mister was simply the catalyst.The story wraps up a bit too neatly, and some of the complaints I've seen here about Grisham's preaching about the homeless is certainly justified, however this book is definitely still worth reading."
1,terrible,"I rarely throw away books but I made an exception for ""The Street Lawyer."" I picked it up after I read and really enjoyed ""The Pelican Brief."" After a promising start, the book becomes preachy, didactic, slow, and plain old boring. There are no plot twists and no interesting characters. The writing style is amateurish at best. Grisham can definitely write page turners, ""The Pelican Brief"" and ""The Firm"" come to mind, but this is not one of them. Skip the book. It's a waste of time."
1,"Pedantic, Preachy and Maudlin","I used to love Grisham novels, but have since lost interest but I bought the Street Lawyer expecting little disappointment, since I only paid a buck for it at a book sale, but the disappointment was more than expetation. It gives a good view of life on the streets in urban DC, but most of us are aware of it from the news, or by walking down the average DC street.I want something more than pedantic preaching and maudlin guilt pumped out at a new level from the Presbyterian rich. I have kind of given up on Grisham since he seems to take strictly one side to every issue as if only Liberals have a heart for anything. I guess I got my noney's worth and if another Grisham book for a buck comes out, I may give it a go. I'd be even more enclined to buy them if a his novels cost less."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring !!!","I kept waiting for something exciting to happen in this book, but it never came. As I approached the end, I was expecting a twist in the story - or a surprise ending - but it never came. Do not waste your time with this book, as it was horrible."
1,Unreadable,"The premise of this book is so interesting - a homeless man holds up a law office. But the premise is the only interesting part of this book. Even the hold-up scene itself is weak. Then suddenly the narrator spends all his time thinking over the fact that he is rich but other people are poor and trying to reconcile his lifestyle with the ideology he developed in 14 seconds, which is instantly his only characteristic. Sure, people have life-changing experiences, but this guy would never exist in real life. He's just tacky and unrealistic - had he never seen a homeless person before?Grisham clearly wrote this to prove a point (or to make some bucks) and neglected to make the story interesting and the characters worth caring about. Seriously, don't bother with this one."
2,Forget about this one,"This one has to be, by far, the worst book by Grisham, or should I say the only one which is not excellent. It is so stupid that you really don't want to read it."
3,Praiseworthy Civil Act,"The readers, who anticipate a new page-turner from a famous author of legal thrillers, will be disappointed. In this novel John Grisham, who has stupendous audience all over the world, speaks loudly and distinctly about social problems of the U.S.homeless citizens. It is a praiseworthy civil act but unfortunately some characters of the book (including the main one) and their decisions and deeds appear artificial at times. Perhaps the author tells not about IS but about SHOULD BE: thank you, John, may your expectations come true..."
1,About as interesting as a bag of unsalted peanuts!,"Like many of the reviewers before me, I too, am very disappointed with JG's latest effort.(and I might add that I am a big fan who has read every one of his books) While it is subject matter that deserves attention, I'm not sure that this is the forum that should be chosen. The novel plods along (after a rather exciting beginning) and never really picks up speed. The ending is too predictable and it's easier to feel sorrow for the main character than admiration! Unfortunately, both The Partner and this novel make me wonder if JG should consider going back to his ""roots"" and return to courtroom drama. I wouldn't recom mending spending your hard-earned dollars for this lemon... check it out from the library (and ask for 4 weeks... it may take you that long to wade through it)."
3,John Grisham LITE,Like Tom Clancy's OP-Center series THE STREET LAWYER is a nice short story in the respective genres these authors have been known for. A single story line keeps this story moving at a quick pace but this story does not contain the in-depth characters and storylines that captured readers in his first (and best) books.
2,Extremely boring and predictable,"As an avid Grisham reader, I couldn't wait for The Streetlawyer to become available. I read it in less than a day. That's how boring this book was. Other times I want to savour the story as long as possible and force myself to read only when I'm on the train. Extremely predictable, no substance, no debth of character and I truly regret spending so much money on the book (living in Europe makes it almost double the original cost). The story is almost a documentary dedicated to the homeless (which I commend), with no logic, the homeless people involved not really having a chance to tell their story or why Grisham decided to dedicate his next multi-million dollar book to them. My question is: what is Mr. Grishman's annual income and is he feeding the hungry, like ""Mister"" so adequately asked in the first chapter. If he is, more power to him. If he's not; now he knows where to turn to. Just leave us out of it."
4,Good ideas but it's definitely a future Hollywood movie.,"This is really not a bad book. I realize that he is manipulating his name and writing with intent to eventually make money off of a Hollywood box office hit but this story makes you think. His past books didn't really do that. Homelessness is running rampant all of our country and the majority of the U.S population (270 million) don't think twice about it, only that they don't wish this terrible misfortune to fall upon them. But many of these people didn't take to life on the streets because they wanted to. The reasons are diverse. Grisham is a good writer overall and I think for the first time he has attempted to make his large fanfare think about deeper issues than just about courtroom procedure, etc. I hope he continues on this track."
2,Only if you want SOMETHING quick to read!!!,The characters in this book didn't have depth. He didn't make you really care about them and theirsituations. There didn't seem to be any real deepdown dialogue between anyone.
1,Wait for the movie.,"John Grisham's novels have steadily gone downhill. Instead of writing literature, he is writing screenplays. For this book, the characters have no depth, the plot is very predictable and unfocused. I borrowed it from my best friend to read on a cross country flight. She doesn't want it back, and I got more entertainment and mental stimulation from watching cloud formations.If you are a reader, don't waste your time. If you prefer movies, wait until it comes on TV at 3am and watch it when you are drunk."
1,Embarassingly bad,"A book about the homeless, particularly by a ""major"" author, is to be commended. However, I cringed while reading The Street Lawyer. Every character is a cardboard cutout. Everyone just does things to advance the plot and almost none of it is believable. It would take a very talented and subtle writer to convincingly portray a high-powered corporate lawyer giving up everything overnight to devote his life to helping the less fortunate. This book doesn't even come close to pulling it off. It's poorly written and, simply stated, bad. I am starting to fear that Mr. Grisham is never going to return to the form he displayed in A Time to Kill."
1,please return to your legal/mystery roots,"I have read all JG's books. First one in line when a new one comes out. Although I live in metro. Washington, D.C. and can relate to many of the places discussed in the book, I found it rather dull. Please return to stories like ""The Firm,"" ""Pelican Brief,"" etc. Didn't like ""The Chamber,"" either. Please don't disappoint your loyal readers again. We need your talent."
2,"Okay John, what happened to the good stuff???","I rarely delve into the ""pop culture"" book list, and ""The Street Lawyer"" is a good example of why. Grisham's early books were good. They kept me interested. But Johnny boy is just not keeping up with his reputation these days. You are told the entire story one-third into the book. And the rest just seems to come off as dribble -- a filler of sorts. Something told me to check this one out at the library instead of paying for it. And I am proud to say I did just that."
2,Grisham has done better,"Despite being an avid reader and an immense John Grisham fan, I found ""The Pelican Brief"" slow and stale. The book started out promisingly enough, but soon failed to hold my interest. The plot was lame, the characters underdeveloped, and the ending left much to be desired. I do not reccomend this book to anyone, Grisham enthusiast or not. Save your money, and your time."
2,His weakest attempt,This book starts off strong and then dies. Grisham is a better writer than this book indicates. Try some of his other works.
4,A vision of how one person can impact the lives of others,"This is one of Grisham's best yet. The plot moved rapidly at first, and just when it became predictable, it took a intriguing tack, and eleveates into another realm. I recommend it highly."
2,"A GRAND BEGINNING, BUT A BORING ENDING!!!","ALL THE TALK ON THE STREET PEOPLE, WHICH WAS VERY INTERESTING, EVEN UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK, BUT NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT WHO DID WHAT FOR THE STREET PEOPLE AFTER THE $$$$ CAME IN!!!! THE ENDING WAS NOT HIS BEST!! DID NOT COME CLOSE TO THE THE PARTNER!!!!"
2,disappointing - Grisham can do much better.,It's hard to believe much effort was put into this book - it was predictable and lacking in suspense.
4,Much more likeable,"I am quite surprised by the reviews of other readers here. My biggest complaint with his other books, which were good, were that the characters were 2d at best. I would much rather read a book with characters with some depth. And as for the guy that says he could never believe someone would have a change of heart and dump that job to follow what he thought was right, I feel sorry for you. You must be either really young, or really cynical."
4,Well Worth Reading.,This book is not the usal story by John Grisham. It moves away from his southern backdrops and more in depth courtroom cases. But still an excellent book.
1,This book is horrible. Really horrible. Trust me.,"I had never read a John Grisham book. But I am generally a believer in the notion that ""if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."" So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing. A week ago I picked up ""The Street Lawyer,"" and I was prepared to be entertained.Boy, was I wrong.This book stinks to high heavens. This man cannot write. ""The Street Lawyer"" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches. I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy. Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words."
1,The Street Lawyer could be retitled 'The Sedative Lawyer',"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed all of Grisham's previous novels so I was very disappointed with this one---it was predictable, the characters lacked depth, and tedious to complete.Perhaps Grisham should choose between either writing an 'issue' book or writing an entertaining story---clearly he wasn't successful attempting to do both.This book has made me wary of future Grisham novels."
2,Do As I Say...Not As I Do,"After Grisham's gratituitous digs at and lack of tolerance for politicians of a different persuasion, I was anxious to read the last page of the book where John was donating the proceeds from the sale of this book to the homeless. Unfortunately, I didn't find such a page. I guess the profits go into this rich writer's pocket and the homeless can keep sleeping in cars. The writer's hypocrisy certainly detracts from the effect and believability of the book. True Grisham fans will be able to read the book, but if this Grisham book is your first -- don't do it."
1,Politically Correctness + Boredom= The Street Lawyer,"Dissapointment. The Street Lawyer began as a wild fire that grabbbed you in the beginnig chapters. After the suspense and action concluded by about page 25,the fire was all but extinguished. The Street Lawyer could have been told in only a few sentences. Money isnt everything. Respect the homeless. Yada,Yada, yada. This novel fooled me with its initial excitement, and resulted in a dull,slow waste of time. Dont get me wrong. Grisham is my favorite author. I find most of his novels intriguing. But this book was a departure from his usual courtroom suspense. And an unsuccessful one at that."
3,Started great then got boring,"This definitely isn't Grisham's best work. The plot isn't that exciting, yet I still had to continue reading to find out what happened to the characters (they were very likeable and interesting). If you haven't read The Runaway Jury (Grisham) get that one instead."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"Grisham's The Street Lawyer didn't appeal to me, perhaps because I read it right after The Pilot's Wife, The Triumph and the Glory, and Memoirs of a Geisha. It couldn't compare to those three gems, at least not in my mind."
4,Money is important but its NOT everything,"After a slight dissapointment with the Runaway Jury, I found the Street Lawyer full of emotions. This is so especially when an incident hit Mike and changed his entire life and its not impossible to happen to us. In life money is important but its not everything, there's more to it in life than just $$$$$. I am also touched by the author's comments that he had not worried too much about the homeless before writing this book but with his effort this book was published and I believe it has touched him emotionally one way or the other. Thumbs up to Grisham for delivering such an entertaining story."
2,A little bit anti-climactic,"The beginning of the book was quite strong, but it dragged on to be a book about how we should all give to the homeless. I didn't like how he wrapped the ending up in a nice little package. I enjoy John Grisham books very much, but this one was a bit disappointing."
3,Good story but lost in the clutter of homeless soap,"Grisham can weave a tale and create exceptional characters. However Street Lawyer loses most of its momentum and story with the constant explanations of the plight of the homeless. He makes his point through the first two or three homeless descriptions and the overall plot. By the tenth such expose, it becomes an overbearing weight."
3,Not among his best,"I am a big fan of John Grisham. Although I enjoyed this book, I don't rank it among his best. Like ""The Chamber"", this book doesn't have the dynamics of his other work, but I still enjoyed the read. For first time readers of Grisham, you would be better served to start with ""The Partner"", ""Rainmaker"", or ""The Runaway Jury."" Some of the other ""amateur"" reviewers you see listed here will blast Grisham for a slow ""Chamber"" or ""Street Lawyer"", but I still think they are better reads than most of the other pap you'll find out there."
2,"IF YOU'VE READ ONE GRISHAM, YOU'VE READ THEM ALL","This is the latest in Grisham's growing list of formula novels. The plots are predictable, the characters stereotypical, the lessons preachy. He has clearly lost the magic of his earlier books. The real cliffhanger for me is what Grisham will do with all those millions of dollars he earns from all the readers who were subjected to his personal ""give it all away and follow me"" manifesto. If he wants to provide a realistic view of lawyers, I suggest he visit some who are actually in the trenches and who actually know where the courthouse is. John Grisham is no lawyer, and he is now nothing more than a mediocre book-of-the-month-club author."
5,Excellent,"I have read all of Grisham's books. Though it was not his best, it was very enjoyable. I was once again caught up in his plot and the action of the novel. I thoroughly enjoy the way that he allows the reader to really understand the traits of the character. You get a real sense that you are there with the main character and that you can relate to him. It was great that the ending was not cheesy and that you left the book with a feeling that there is a greater sense of reality. This is something that has been missing in the last few books. I look forward to reading the next version and yes, I will be there buying the hard copy! Thank you Mr. Grisham for such wonderful books."
2,Not Grisham's best moment!,"Although I have always been a loyal Grisham fan, I have no choice but to pan this book. The best thing that can be said about it is that it is informative. However, it's not captivating, or even interesting in the least. You leave this book feeling like you've gotten a five hour lecture about homelessness. This work has none of his Grisham's usual suspense and thrill which have always made his books a pleasure to read."
1,"Thanks for the sermon, John","This book was like being preached at for 200 pages, and then being left without an ending. It's obvious that now that Mr. Grisham has reached a certain level of success, he wrote this book for himself, and to express his personal political and social views. I have always been a Grisham fan and feel that he has written many great books (The Firm!), and I will probably read his next book also, however I don't feel that being a loyal reader of his books deserves the punishment that this book inflicted. Please don't make this one into a movie!"
2,Lukewarm Grisham,"Another piece of social commentary like The Chamber. Grisham doesn't believe in capital punishment and we should all quit our jobs to help the homeless. I wonder if he has ever worked with homeless people. It can be a lot more frustrating than it's portrayed in this book. I won't be buying any more Grisham in hardback, that's for sure."
1,Not worth reading,"For some unknown reason Mr. Grisham paints a lawyer who helps the homeless as a saint. There are so many real saints in this country who give of themselves over and over again to help the homeless, the hungry, etc. and they make far less than $30,000 a year. And they aren't ashamed, nor do they think they are ""holier than thou"", like the ""Street Lawyer"".This book angered me and as several other readers have noted, I certainly hope Mr. Grisham gives all of the proceeds of this book to homeless organizations throughout the country. If he doesn't, he is a hypocrite.This book was very unrealistic in parts and overall it felt like Mr. Grisham dictated the entire book in one sitting to his overworked secretary. One last comment, my fiance is a lawyer and was not surprised that Mr. Grisham is focusing on his career as a writer because the references to legal issues were often inaccurate."
2,NOT UP TO GRISHAM'S STANDARD,This is a very shallow story that plays on a major real tragic problem. Grisham's book reads like a movie script. The characters have very little definition. The one good thing about the book is that it doesnt take long to read it :-D I don't imagine it took long to write either!!
4,Fantastic Read!,"I have officially declared myself a John Grisham fan. The first novel of his that I read was the Chamber. A story with a heart! Then came The Street Lawyer. I would not hesitate to recommend Grisham's work to anybody that is looking for a good read that has both quality and substance. The Street Lawyer storyline is realistic,moral,funny,touching and highly relatable---no preaching at all!I would write a long review but I am tied up with The Rainmaker...another Grisham novel."
2,Definitely NOT Grisham's Best,"In the past, Grisham's ability to spin clever and suspenseful plots have usually masked his mediocre writing style; I have thoroughly enjoyed all his other novels. This one, however, lacks suspense and is full of predictable, tired, and cliche verbage. Although his crusade to illustrate the plight of the homeless is respectable, his analysis of the problem is overly simplistic and pretentious. I had trouble finishing the story."
4,"good book, showing the dark side of the dubel-standard USA","Grisham has again made a good book. This one not beeing so much about law it self, but also about the people in the streets, the homeless. The book gives you a good picture of the american sociaty, where people just think about them self, and not of other. It gives you an inside into how the communaty is not thinking about the poor, but only at the rich - the tipical, stupid, duble-standard US sociaty is under attac - and it is good."
3,Not bad/Not great,"This was better than the Chamber but not nearly as good as the Pelican Brief and The Firm. I enjoyed it while sitting in the sun, but for a serious read, this is not the one to pick."
2,Boring and plotless,"When I first started the Street Lawyer, I was extremely delighted to see that it resembled ""The Rainmaker"", one of my favorites of Grisham. The perspective was the same, it had good elements in the beginning, and it seemed like it was going to be a real page-turner. Instead, what I found was a boring mess with no plot. The conclusion seemed to be rushed, as it is resolved in the final 3 pages or so...this is truly the most boring book I have ever read...I almost had to force myself to finish it. It seemed to be a book telling you about the homeless, with the characters as an afterthought."
2,Enough already with a lawyer saving the little people,"Okay, this is Grisham's ninth novel about an inexperienced lawyer going to bat for the poor and unfortunate. As with his others, it is well written (thus the second star), but this one was simply formula, nothing more, nothing less. Yes, I have sympathy for those living on the streets, but only to a certain extent. Many panhandlers make up to $500.00 a day, begging. I agree that this country has a long way to go to helping the homeless, but to portray all homeless as victims is stretching things much too far."
3,A pretty good book..,"A good read, went through this book in just a few days. But lately, Grisham's books have seemed more geared with a movie in mind. Not as unpredictable and exciting as his earlier books."
4,He's Back to Good,"Its Good to see that John Grisham has gotten out of his rut of putting out simple predictable stories. The Street Lawyer is truly great. I found that when I started reading it, that I became lost in his words and before long I was 150 pages deep. It is a truly inspiring novel, and a lot of people need to read and pick up on its message. Living in the DC area I know how the homeless problem is big, and how it isn't dealt with in a good way, hopefully more people will read this book and it will inspire them to look into the problems surronding their area, and do something about it."
2,I guess good authors can write TRASH too,"Only buy the paperback edition of this book. That way you can give it to a homeless person. When it is thrown back at you it wont hurt as much. Terrible plot, social commentary, unrealistic. I kept hoping it would liven up, it made my head hurt. This book proves that I will read anything !!! Save your money"
2,Preachy and boring,"I found this book to be extremely boring. By the 300th page I was still telling myself ""Maybe NOW the actual story will start."" But nothing really happens in this book. And, while I respect the stance on homelessness, Grisham keeps repeating the same things over and over. I get the point: People who make money don't give enough to the poor. Get on with it!"
1,John Grisham's Worst Volume Ever!,"I normally think that some Bazookas like pie, but i hate this book! its frontal nasal area is completely nibsillius, and its a very boring Romp throught the flowers of delirium, dementia, and de-duplication, the 'three D's' that most books try, and are succsful too, to avoid!Overall a simian effort from an donkey pony horsey show author, if you think that some terwilligers are just TOO terwilligy, then dont tell me i am a clown with no knowledge of the 'english' language, i think i know that!But, seriously folks, if you like ice cream (and i am sure you do!) then (^) dont pour coffee up your nose!, i cant emphasize (pie) that point enough, cofee is for DRINKING! nose drops are for nose dropping!Sertiwilleger! So dont buy this book, you can buy a stuffed spotted owl instead and have countless hours of enjoyment pouring coffee up ITs nose!Bingo!"
3,What happened?,"The ending killed this book. Really, Grisham could have thought of SOMETHING better. Anything is better than the ending. It's very *cute* and all, but really, give us something REAL. The only reason I bother giving this book three stars is the story before the last 30 pages or so is very good. If it didn't just expire as it did, this book would be his best yet."
4,Another Exciting Novel from Johnny!,"Although I haven't read many of Mr. Grisham's books, this is one of the best I've read! The story-line, while sometimes predictable, always has an unexpected twist. The inner-city setting and the author's closeness to the street people brings the entire plot to life, and leaving the reader begging for a longer book!"
2,Smells like smoke,I ordered this as a new book but it smells like smoke - tobacco. I doubt it's new. It has the initials of someone on the 2nd page. it's in good condition but I ordered new. Disappointed.
1,A drag,"I am generally a fan of Grisham, but this one isn't very good. It could have been a good story but it doesn't ring true. For example, the narrator is 32, but doesn't speak like anyone that age. 32 year olds don't describe people using words like ""youngster,"" ""coed,"" ""queers,"" and so on."
2,"Just what I expected, quick and very light.","EVEN with the attempt of a heavy story, this book fails to envoke emotion on a subject that deserves a harder look. typical Grisham, the writing flows, is easy to follow and can be finished during dinner. The book builds up and but doesn't have a major conclusion, not a lot of excitement and no empathy for the main character. In The Firm, my heart was racing, in the The Street Lawyer-nothing. It is not a bad book and I will probably continue to read his novels, but this is one of his weaker stories."
1,A real nail-grower!!!!,Save your money - the weakest of all Grisham works to date. Hardly worth the trees cut down to print it on. Don't even bother reading it in paperback. Highly recommended for insomnia.
2,Very Disappointed.,"Usually when you get real tired of work or whatever that's happening in your life, you may just want to sit down and read an interesting book to unwind a little. There are too many writers out there who just don't seem to be able to keep the attention span of their readers. So I thought, buy a Grisham book! That will keep me occupied for a few hours. Well, it didn't. I was bored. I was not interested in the character. The drama was not dramatic. Everything was just kind of BLAHHHHH. I was disappointed. Very disappointed."
2,"Yes it's very good, however isn't it obvious?","I have to admit that once I started to read The Street Lawyer, I could not put it down. I was compelled to finish the book and so I did within couple of hours. However, I ve felt that John Grisham's books are rather too easy to read and none of the plots boast any surprises. The fantastical ""happy"" ending is just too obvious for us all."
4,I enjoyed this book immensely.,This book was easy reading.It gave me an idea of how Lawyers gather their information in preparation for presenting their case.
4,I liked it.,"I rarely stray from reading historical fiction, I prefer novels like ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or Stephen King stuff, but after reading ""The Testament"", and now ""The Street Lawyer"" I'm beginning to see rather quickly what all the fuss has been about concerning John Grisham. He is a great writer."
3,This is the first John Grisham book that I have read.,"The book started of good and keep me interested throughout, however I was disappointed in the way that it ended. It didn't live up to my expectations. I'm currently enjoying the Partner now."
3,mmm...I'm not convinced!,"Honestly, I liked this book! I found it involving more or less like other Grisham's books. But the end? John, John...."
3,"If you think The Partner is bad, think again.",I started The Runaway Jury as my first Grisham novel and its plot is classical Grisham. The Partner is ok too. But I just cannot stand the egoism exhibited in The Street Lawyer. It's hardly convincing to see someone on the way to give up big bucks and work for virtually nothing. I am not a lawyer but I just doubt how many lawyers out there buy the story.
2,Great author. Bad Book.,"Even though I am a great fan of John Grisham books, this is surely not his best work. An intensifying beginning, the most unreal ending. Among all of the books he has wrote, The Street Layer is bad. If anyone knows John Grisham, please tell him to write a real courtroom brawl. Not a stupid settlement."
3,"Started out great, but it lost steam","I loved the first couple of chapters. They were engaging, and presented us with a good setup. Unfortunately, the book goes into a ""Help the poor, Destroy the big firms, Be an all-around good guy"" type ranting, which lost my interest quite rapidly. If the main character wants to be ambivalent about his position and go out and help people, fine. Just don't write a propagandist book about it."
5,Big Firm Lawyer goes to the streets,"Mr. Brock, a big time lawyer, on the fast track to being a partner earning a million bucks a year. He is held hostage be an insane street person, inside the firm. The street person asks him about how much they give to poverty each year, and it really makes him think. After his marriage starts to go bad he starts to volenteer in homless shelters, and meets a little boy named Ontario..."
2,Not real,"This book is not so good as other Grishnam novels. It is too non - realistic: rich lawyer leaves his company to woork almost for free in the street? I dont think so. Main character is auwfull developed: from rich nobel guy to street lawyer in 20 pages?? Grishman wanted to present homeless topic on his way, and he got stucked betwenn two chairs."
1,No More Sermonizing - Go preach in the Pulpit!,"I was an avid Grishom fan. I read Runaway Jury and came away disgusted with the constant, heavy anti-smoking sermons. I got The Street Lawyer from the libary...more preaching, but now about how we should all reach out to help the homeless, with the implicit message that no one who earns a good salary would willingly part from any of it except for technical toys. Grishom has demoted himself from the role of a good storyteller to a bad evangelist in order to hammer his philosophies down the reader's throat. Even when you AGREE with his ideology, it wearies...This book was TEDIOUS."
1,About two hundred pages too long,This book had an amazing beginning but that was pretty much it. The rest of the book just drags on with Grisham's didactic language about how we should help the homeless. Pretty much the whole book could be summed up in one line Help the homeless. If I wanted a lecture about helping others I could just go to church.
1,For my first John Grisham book.... what a disappointment,"As an avid reader, I enjoy all types of books. This was the first book by John Grisham I have ever read. I was so disappointed that such a renowned author could have written such a terrible book. It will be very easy for me to never read another."
3,The Street Lawyer is a good light recreational read.,"Using the plight of the homeless vs. the excesses of the wealthy as a vehicle, Grisham takes his standard male character through a typical legal conflict. There are no contrived twists or surprises. There are no serious misstatements of the law. There are no memorable characters. Nor is the book memorable. But, it is a good one-time read."
2,The book lacked the usual plot readers are used to seeing.,"The book had an interesting premise, but, as I read on, I said so what. I could not develop sympathy for the lawyer, or the homeless. What was the point of the wife? I didn't believe that the premise of a stolen file could embarrass a major law firm to its knees, especially over the homeless. What was the point of the 3rd lawyer in the street clinic? How come at convienient points, the social worker for the law clinic simply came up with adresses, names, etc? He did not develop the story well. There was no suspense. I am glad I checked it out of the library"
5,Grisham goes from strength to strength,"Very strong start, the story gets better and better. I found it believable and gripping."
2,Grisham continues downhill slide.,"In a continued attempt to preach from his now (once more) popular pulpit, Grisham has decided to, once again, preach how evil we, and especially all Republicans, are. Since ""The Firm"", Grisham's writing has slowly deteriorated because of his overuse of the now common theme of the disenfranchised fighting against, and beating, the establishment. It's worked when the establishment is someone we all hate (i.e. the Mob, the Tobacco industry, Insurance Firms), but in this book, he goes too far. The establishment is all of us who, according to Grisham, should feel guilty because we work hard. I had trouble finishing it, and the only reason I did, was because I hate not finishing books."
2,"A BOOK THAT HAD A GREAT START, BUT JUST FAILED AT THE END","I feel that I must reward this novel a two or three for the great begining it brought forth to the reader, but once the last one-hundred pages came, I felt very sorry for paying a mere $$30.00 for it. Myself, being, a young published writer, feels he may offer an open perspective to those in which wish to read this so: The book is worth buying if you want your mind to twist into a ball and fear of it making a recovery. Really, this book made me feel as if I were messed up. If you do want to read this, I would wait untill the mass-market edition came onto the market, so you feel you have not wasted merely $$30.00 of your money in which could have been spent else-where. Sorry John--take some time to bring it back up and don't rush to get your work out on the market, your fans will acknowledge you more if you would TRY this path. Best of luck towards the future."
1,Preach It Johnny!,"Mr. Grisham has become a wealthy man. For some reason (perhaps an incident involving a homeless man in New York referenced in Newsweek) John feels guilty about the fruits of his talent. The liberal heart bleeds without clotting, ""If we could all just give the homeless money, then they'd be fine."" If an author wants to preach to his readers, fine. But try to have a good story, building tension, and developed characters worth feeling for. This book was amazing, it had none of that. John needs to keep two quotes in mind when he feels his heart seep: ""The poor will always be among us."" and ""Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime."" Well, Mr. Grisham knows how to ""fish"" and he needs to fish another good thriller from his mind before he alienates his audience with whiney diatribes."
2,Another Grisham alter ego battles evil,"Michael Brock, the Street Lawyer, changes his life to do battle with the evil law firm he resigned from, solving a ""mystery"" the reader sees coming a mile away. Grisham sets up a strawman to pontificate on society at large's indifference to the homeless, while praising the select few who care. The plot takes place in the District of Columbia, the farthest north Grisham has ventured yet; can New York be his next target for evil law firms?"
2,Almost Typical Grisham,"I have read a few of Grisham's works, if you can call them 'works', but this one is by far the worst. The entire story line is so unbelievable and the plot is very weak. I really reccomend this book to people looking for a good laugh rather than a good read."
3,Grisham's Best? I think not...,"Generally speaking, I have very low tastes. There are not many books or movies that I dislike. Which makes my critical review of The Street Lawyer all that more potent. This book starts off very strong, pulling the reader immediately into the action. But after the first few chapters, I found myself reading along, waiting for the good part. As I neared the end of the book, I realized that there was no good part. The book is very predictable and not at all thrilling like Mr. Grisham's past work.I hope that Mr. Grisham will return to his roots and begin writing thrilling novels once again."
3,It's our own fault...,"If readers would stop buying every Grisham novel the minute it comes out, the demand wouldn't be so high and the publishers wouldn't make him write a book every 10 months. Then he would have time to write something of the same caliber as ""A Time to Kill"" or ""The Firm"". Every book is worse than the one before...but I buy them the minute they hit the stands anyway...NOT anymore!!"
2,"Predictable, slow; politically charged","Grisham's distinterest in writing suspense/thrillers is showing. This story is very predictable; characters are uninteresting. Yes, homelessness is a serious problem--a problem that we all are concerned about.The story would be more impactful if Grisham had stated that he was going to donate the proceeds from book sales to homeless shelters."
4,"Readable entertainment, but technical legal flaws","As per usual Grisham, the book is entertaining. Grisham should practice more real law, however, and know that you can't settle claims on behalf of clients you THINK you will have, but don't have yet. Also, how much ethical difference does it make, whether the people thrown out onto the street have a legal right to the building, when the outcome in either case is freezing to death?"
2,wait for the movie...,"Grisham's first still stands as his best, even though I believe my love for that book stems from its similarity to ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". With the exception of ""The Partner"" I find little of Grisham to recommend to others. His latest makes great vacation reading - where you might be looking for something ""lite"" to read. I'd wait for the movie..."
1,Yuck!,"IF you like rambling, unfocused, left wing propaganda you will love this one. It's boring and typical Grisham now."
2,Grisham has done better...,"There were only two things I liked about this book: 1. Michael Brock is one whom we can all admire; he is someone who is frustrated with his job as a lawyer, someone who has decided that more money at his firm, Drake and Sweeney, was not as important as helping other people (but is this really believable?) 2. Grisham's okay-but-not-so-good descriptions of the homeless. Why doesn't Grisham use his potential talent and turn it into something enjoyable, instead of a slow, difficult-to-finish, bad read? It's not that Grisham is a bad writer, but the same theme in a different setting, with different characters has become almost like Danielle Steele...THE STREET LAWYER was definitely a waste of my money and time!"
5,The Street Lawyer a review by Giovanni Fantauzzi,"The Street LawyerThe street lawyer starts in New York City. It starts like any other day at the big time law firm Drake & Sweeney until a homeless man makes the lawyers into hostages in one of the longest days they will ever have in their life. You would think making a bunch of lawyers hostages is ridiculous but in fact theirs more to it than you know. Everything would have been fine if he wasn't wrongly evicted from his apartment by none other than Drake & Sweeney. One man had his life changed because of it. So he set out to find out why he was evicted. But in order to find out he had to steal a file and become a fugitive on the run from police searching for the stolen file. Later he turned to public interest law to help the poor. Through all this he divorced from his wife, and left all the luxuries behind to start fresh in a new home."
2,fine but not very gripping,"(Legal ""thriller"") A lawyer is taken hostage by a homeless guy and is inspired to start working with the homeless. He discovers dirt behind the hostage situation. Not the most thrilling thriller. Fine but pretty straightforward. Seems to be trying to teach people about homelessness.Potentially offensive material: Some language, some violence"
2,I like John Grisham's books but this was really bad,"Okay, its been a while but all i know was that the begining wasn't so bad. He and some of his co-workers are kept hostage by some homeless guy and they're all scared about what this guy is about to do with that gun. Then when the Homeless person comes to open the door for the food, the police blows his brains out. Now that part was really exciting so I kept on reading hoping like that would show up again. But it didn't. The rest of the story is how he does pro bono work and goes after his old company and in the end wins by having his old law firm due pro bono work. All in all, a pretty dumb book."
3,Below Grisham Standard,"I was disappointed. Without a doubt, the worst of the several Grisham books I have read. Still though, Grisham sets a high standard. Overall its a 3 star book. But this book lacks very much in suspense."
3,The weakest Grisham,"I didn't like this Grisham as well as the others. Not as much suspense, I guess. But, I think he wrote this one for a different reason than just to entertain. His comment on society and homelessness couldn't keep me interested in this story."
2,A Feel Good Read at Best,"Grisham's novel has an important theme but it is too slow to develop. It's starts off great, but as you progress thorough the book, the plot slows down. It seem like the first chapter was the climax of the novel. I wouldn't call it riveting or engrossing, but if your a lawyer with a guilty conscience or you are just wanting to be informed (a little) about the poor and how terribly wronged they are in society well this may be for you."
1,"Seen one, you've seen 'em all.",I liked this book the first time I read it...When it was called _A Time to Kill_.
1,old fan comes back but not for good,I used to be a big Grisham fan in the early 90's. Needed a beach book decided to give this book a go. Terrible choice on my part. I put it down after a few chapters. If I wanted a sermon I'd go to church. I wonder how much of the profits from this book were given to the poor?
2,Mediocre,"Writing and story were not characteristic of Grisham. He seemed to write as if his readers could not remember what was just said in a previous paragraph. Very preachy about the plight of the homeless. I am giving it two stars because I could actually finish reading it, but I do not recommend this book at all."
2,More than a slight dissapointment,"I was disapointed in this book by John Grisham. The story was slightly predicitable, contrite and had an easily determined plot. It didn't seem to have the suspense that normally is such an integral part of John Grisham's novels. Hopefully his next attempt at socail conscience will be more enjoyable for the reader."
3,ANOTHER GRISHAM'S BOOK,I THINK HE IS GETTING OUT OF TOPICS OR PLOTS. THE STORY IS ALMOST SAME AS OTHERS.
1,"BORING, BORING, BORING!!!","I found this book to be very elementary in its writing. My third grader could have turned out a better book than this. I have read every book by this author, but no more. The last three have been a big disappointment. Time to move on to bigger, and better. He's lost his ability to hold my interest."
2,Worst ever seen...,"I can't understand why Mr.Grisham sells too many books around the world! To write on lawyers matters seems interesting at first glance but, write ALWAYS on lawyers matters, I think, gets bored little by little. I admit that I liked ""The Firm"" and ""The Client"". However, ""The Street Lawyer"" is so comum and 'attractiveless'... If I were you, I would buy a Jules Verne's novel. It would be more interesting..."
4,"As always, a real page turner!","Perhaps not the most gripping of the Grisham novels, it was a page turner none the less. An enjoyable read...too bad a Grisham book rarely lasts more than a few days."
1,A pot boiler thrown out to satisfy some new acquaintances,"The Street Lawyer was shallow. One of the reviewers said he read it on a two hour flight. Grisham probably spent less than two hours writing this book. Having read his past books, I kept waiting for characters, plot, and drama to materialize. They never did."
1,We get the message already,"It started out to be an interesting story but he just kept hammering home the message about good and righteous homeless people vs evil corporations. It got old very quickly. If you don't like being preached to, skip this one."
2,Another tedious Grisham formula,"My favourite Grisham books are ""The Firm"", ""The Chamber"" and ""The Rainmaker""--in other words, the first three I read. Even they weren't anything spectacular. After that, one Grisham book was almost exactly the same as the other. ""The Street Lawyer"" I didn't particularly enjoy at all, I mean it was a nice well-meaning idea and all that, but it was a BIG idea and frankly Grisham just doesn't have the skill to cut it. I think I can safely say I'll be avoiding any future Grishams--such as ""The Testament""--without fear of missing anything.Anybody who gets anything other than boredom out of this book please contact me. I'd be interested to know what medication you're regularly prescribed."
4,"If you read it, it helps you to think on other people.","Its quiet interesting to read it. A Non stop lecture. It helps you to put your feets on the floor. What is it the main thing that you wanna do in your life? work, work and work a lot or try to put yourself not 'in the pole position'. Thing in and help others; others that probably need from and more than you."
2,Not my favorite,"I am only 15 but I have read almost all of JG's books and I dont feel this is one of his best. I think this one was not very likeable for me because is it not likely that a high profile lawyer would give up all he is getting for a low paying job working for the homeless. I believe this is not even close to as good as ""The Rainmaker."""
3,A FAIR READ,"This was an okay book, but not like any other Grisham's I have read. I felt like he was trying to give me a lesson on morality and was testing my ethics on the less fortunate. I didn't hate it, but it was one of my least favorites of all the Grisham's."
4,Another Great Grisham Novel,"I thought this was a very insightful and enjoyable novel. Mr. Grisham never fails to provide twists and turns in his novels and create stories that make me keep turning pages until the wee hours of the morning. This book looks deep into the lives of the homeless and points out many things about their existence that I never would have known. I had never heard of ""street law"" and was inspired by finding out that it exists and getting a glimpse of what these people do to help their fellow man. Unlike the other reviewer, I think this book could have been even longer. I would love to have seen the relationships at the end of the story develop and see where they headed. I congratulate Mr. Grisham on a job well done and for a great read! You won't be disappointed."
4,"Well, GREAT START and Disappointing ENDING","I have just finished reading this book. Wow, this was so GOOD. But still I cannot give five stars. Because I think five star book deserves everlasting support from the readers. And I don't think if this book can be the best book of 1990's. But this book surely worth four stars. I read some reviews and all said that the beginning was so good. I agree to it. Until page 250 it was incredible. I admire John Grisham! However I slowed down after page 250. But still it was readible. It was still better than other books. I only think that Grisham could have made the ending better. You would like this."
4,GOOD,"I agreed with others that this book certainly lacks the actions and excitement found in The Firm etc. But, in another sense, I think it's a good sign because Grisham is writing things in a more realistic way. The Firm might be great in its fast-paceness, but when you consider the truthfulness and social awareness as the issue, The Street Lawyer, of course is much more contributory. Actually, one must have realised that John Grisham has tried his way in similar manner e.g. The Chamber or The Rainmaker. Nonetheless, his works always evoke great expectation from the readers. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: The Rainmaker."
5,This book is a must for any Grisham fan.,"My husband and I had to travel quite extensively this month, and to keep us both awake, we bought The Street Lawyer. After 5 cds, I was looking for the 6th. We just didn't want it to end. The storyline is about a young and well to do lawyer who after undergoing a hostage situation with a homeless person decides to leave his big bucks firm and work as a counselor/lawyer for the homeless. The book asks you to stop and question what your responsibility is to the world and those less fortunate. Some of the issues were touchy for me, but overall, I really enjoyed the book. In addition, the narration is excellent and brings so much life into the characters. It's fun just to hear them all speak and know that it's coming from one mind and one mouth!"
3,Grisham got bored in writing towards the end,"The beginning was great, but it seemed like John Grisham got tired and bored of writing toward the second half of the book. Very disappointed at the ending. Enjoyed the Firm much more."
3,Good but not Great,"The only other Grisham novel I've read is The Firm, which had more action and was more entertaining than this one. This book starts off with a very intense scene, but see very little action afterwards. The story goes on to detail how Michael's life changes and he helps the homeless, but the transition isn't quite convincing enough. Grisham is great with quick, active scenes, but when it comes to inner monologues or personal transitions, he could use some work. He describes the external events, but what exactly IS going on inside Michael's head? We rarely hear how he really feels about the incident at the beginning, about the corruption at his firm, of his estrangement from his wife, etc. It was almost a little too glib about really intense subject matter."
2,very disapointing,This started off with a lot of potential but then it really faltered and got boring. Really all the whole thing is about is the main character going to homeless shelter and helping the homeless. This book was painfully slow. It did have a fairly good plot but the book didn't follow the plot enough. This is the reason I gave the book only 2 stars. So if you don't like long dragging books don't read The Street Lawyer.
3,A pleasant surprise,"The Street lawyer is the best John Grisham novel in a while, in my opinion.Although I consider Grisham to be a ""light-weight"" of a writer, he is enjoyable; every so often I need to cleanse my reading palette with one of his works. Unfortunately, he had become so formulaic that there was little left to enjoy anymore.With this in mind, I delved into The Street Lawyer, and found it to be one of his best. All of the formula action was gone (hurrah!), the drama was in the story itself, rather than the action sequences, the book doesn't end with the main character running away to a tropical isle (that was a real shock). I'd label many of his other books as preposterous, but The Street Lawyer had the ring of truth to me.Congratulations to Grisham for breaking, somewhat, from his past works. For a change, he wrote a book, rather than a screenplay-in-the-making."
3,Good escapism,"Mr. Grisham never fails to present a riviting story with lots of lawyer trivia. In this one, a promising young associate with a powerful law firm in DC is among a group of fellow lawyers taken hostage by a homeless man. This incident propels the protagonist into the seeing the plight of the poor. It is certainly predictable that he quits the firm, who has unwittingly allowed a terrible injustice to occur. The rest of the book, which I won't reveal, is about the wrangle between the firm and the lawyer. It got a little tiresome in places; I felt the book could lose many, many pages! But it was an OK read by a solid performer. It filled up a rainy holiday."
3,Not one of his best pieces,I think that this is not in John Grisham's set of finest pieces of art (such as Time to Kill or The runaway Jury)The story goes about a rich and wealthy lawyer from DC that suddenly changes his way of seeing things and leaves the warm office for helping out homeless...He could have done better....
2,The Street Lawyer Review,"I have just finished reading The Street Lawyer by John Grisham. It was a very interesting book that made me feel as if I was right there in the book. The Street Lawyer had a lot of suspense in the beginning yet the ending was weak. Also, the plot was a little skim. The Runaway Jury is another book by John Grisham that I have also recently read. I preferred it to The Street Lawyer. It had much more suspense & had a surprise ending that I enjoyed."
2,Plup Fiction,"Another one in the Grisham burn and churn machine of legal thrillers. All of his stories are about the same so I will not add to the other reviews full of the story details. I just could not believe the main story line, and for me that spelled the death of the book. I kept saying to my self - ""yea right"". Overall, the author continues in his long chain of McBooks and gives us something that holds your interest over TV commercials, but really does not offer a sink your teeth into story. This book is a light, easy to read and complete legal novel that will be forgotten in a few years."
2,Anticlimactic and predictable...don't waste your time,"I have read several Grisham books, and each one less exciting than the last. I loved The Partner, but this one is simply uneventful. I kept reading awaiting some sort of climax which never materialized. The book seemed like more of an avenue for Grisham to convey his newly found liberal views about how the whole world should pay more attention to and support the homeless. While that's all good in reality, it didn't serve to entertain readers looking forward to a Grisham thriller.If John wants to advocate social issues, he should do it at a venue where people are interested. Not in a novel."
2,Nice Story Bad Politics,"Grisham makes a nice story with this book and his main character is a sympathetic one. The other charaters are the usual cynical people. The problem I had was with the politics of the book. If Mr. Grisham wants to help the homeless, have at it. But by reading this book the homeless have no responsibility for where they are or that they remain where they are. It is the fault of the Republican Congress, who have this silly notion that the taxes they receive should not be poured out to people who choose not to work and pay taxes or the cops or the rich. It is all some one else's fault. Again the story is not bad but ignore the politics."
3,Grisham heads downhill,"A somewhat uninspiring story of a lawyer stumbling over his own conscience. Though the descriptions of a down-and-out neighborhood and the people that are forced to live there are good, the story itself lacks pace, and the ending was about as unsatisfactory as you could imagine.If you're looking for the sort of gripping tale that Grisham weaves in 'The Firm' or 'The Testamant', you'll be sadly disappointed."
4,The Street Lawyer,"Grisham is sending a message, there's two standards in the justice system. One for the rich and one for the poor. Micheal Brock had a near death experience by a gunman which held him and eight other lawyers hostage.He was a homeless man who felt he had know rights. Money can't buy you happiness.He became a street lawyer."
3,Very unlikely to happen,"I had a good time while reading this book but it is extremely unlikely that someone so successful as he (the hero) was simply turn out to being the person whom he ended up being. Extreme fantasy!! The reality is far different from that, and to tell you the truth, this is what caught my attention on the book."
2,Grisham fan is disappointed,"I have loved every one of Grisham's books and admire him as a person. However, I am afraid he has gotten too rich and now feels guilty. The ""poor"" people in our country are better off than 90% of the world population. Grisham needs to run for office (as a democrate, of course) and right every wrong. If he does hang onto your billfold. I sincerely hope he can get back on track and deliver as he has in the past. Or has he lost that fire in his gut?"
2,A PBS Special Not a Novel!,"This novel could be a social primer for people planning to volunteer in aiding the homeless. A novel? As _Donnie Brasco_ said, ""Forgetaboutit!"" I kept waiting for something to happen. Could the villians perhaps be Bill and Hillary in another land deal called ""squatgate"" or perhaps a Bondesque type villian wanting to take over the world? ""Forgetaboutit""! The firm ""rolls"" over faster than a dog with a itch. It's no wonder Grisham has said he won't sell the rights for a movie. This story is so lame they'd have to rewrite the book to make it even romotely interesting. Sorry, John, it's a real stinker but a great social lesson."
2,Save your money unless you have nothing else to read.,"This book consists of about 100 pages of plot and about 250 pages describing the plight of the homeless. After a while, I tuned out the homeless preaching, but then realized that the plot was thin and uninteresting. In short, it was a major disappointment. It saddens me, too, because I thought that ""The Partner"" was a very entertaining read and that perhaps he was back on track."
1,What a stinker!!,"I can't believe I wasted money on this book! This is, without a doubt, the worst book Grisham has written. No plot twists, no character development - I actually fell asleep reading the last few pages because it was SO predictable. As a Republican, I was quite offended by the continuing insinuations that we were responsible for the entire problem of homelessness! Does Mr. Grisham put his money where his mouth is? Let's see his tax return!!"
2,Definitely not John Grisham's best,"I don't expect John Grisham's books to be great literature, but I do expect better than this. The first chapter grabbed my attention, but as I kept reading, all I could think was, ""Is this all there is to this plot""? The narrative has a very preachy tone. Yes, we all need to be more concerned about all people, but this book is like a hammer about homelessness."
4,"This the feed back to our society from the author, marvelous","There are all over the world, the street people, whatever the reasons which make them become the street people, from whatever point of view, they are the people whom we should pay much of our sympathy. The author, John Grisham has been making some money from his writing. Now. with a heart of an angel, he starts to feed back to our society. And this act is an act that every money making author should learn and follow this example. John Grisham, we hope will lead us, to the coming century, to a brighter world. Furthermore. John Grisham studied very hard, from his books one could learn a lot of rhetorics, not to mention the words he chose to write."
2,If you've got (too much) Time to Kill -- Read this book,"Grisham has gotten into the Western Union business again -- he's delivering us a message. The book starts with a bang. A homeless man holds a group of rich white lawyers hostage for a few hours in the firm's plush DC offices. It's downhill from there as our protagonist gets the guilts, leaves the firm, chucks his marraige to an up-and-coming surgeon and starts helping the homeless. The characters are one-dimensional especially Mordecai Green the head of the law clinic. He's a walking cliche. In fact, almost all scenes set at the clinic lacked snap, crackle and pop."
3,"HO HUM, ANOTHER GRISHAM LAWYER BOOK","GRISHAM HAS CHURNED OUT ANOTHER LAWYER BOOK, THIS TIME DEALING WITH THE HOMELESS OF WASHINGTON DC. IT'S A GOOD READ, BUT I GUESS I EXPECT SOMETHING WITH MORE PUNCH TO IT FROM JOHN GRISHAM."
4,"Elsie(elsieg@hotmail.com) from Panama, 07/19/98","Reading this book let me see the writer on the other side, not the firm, the one that really need help and justice. Also, give us a detail how is people leaving on the streets and the reason why they are on it."
1,One word: Library,"This is the first Grisham I've borrowed from the library and not purchased, and the second one I've hated ('The Chamber' being the other). If Grisham keeps it up he is going to lose a large part of his loyal following. I could care less about a person's politics as long as he write's a good story, but when he attempts to preach and convert he loses all appeal to me. Grisham's caveat in the afterword in which he states ""before writing this book, I had not cared too much about the homeless..."" is facile coming from a multimillionaire. The tone of the entire book was so condescending. If Grisham phones the next one in too , I'll be content to re-read 'The Firm' and 'The Pelican Brief' again instead of wasting a trip to the library."
1,"Low on suspense and spark, I'm glad I borrowed it.","Mr. Grisham seems to be falling into the ""I'm rich now and feeling guilty, let me do something to make me feel better"" path taken by many other celebrities. I want another Firm or Pelican Brief, which I consider his best books, not a commentary on our social problems. That's what the news media is for. The Street Lawyer lacked the sissle, suspense, and spark Mr. Grisham's earlier works had. John, please give us more work like the Firm."
1,Burned out on Grisham,"John... John find a new editor. Princeton does not have a Law School! I liked the attempt to get away from the lawyer trying to get rich image, the story was somewhat interesting, but this glairing mistake really bothered me. I have the feeling that Grisham has found a get rich formual of his own and keeps trying to find a slightly new twist to sucker the public into thinking its new. Nice try but this will only work with those who believe that Princeton does have a law school."
3,Fun Read - different....,This book was very entertaining allthough unrealistic. I had fun with the main character and I was amazed at his tanasisty to search for the truth - no matter what the cost or outcome would be.I would like to see Grisham write another book with a heroine... his last book that centered on a female was the Pelican Brief - which was one of his best books yet.
3,Too preachy,I am quite a fan of John Grisham and have always enjoyed his novels. This one though left me a little cold. I am taking writing classes myself and one of the rules I have learned is - don't preach. John Grisham does this big-time in this book about homelessness. I agree the whole western world needs a wakeup call about this issue but I think a subtle approach would have worked much better rather than hitting us all over the head with it as he did here. Much better to entertain and give a life lesson without the reader being aware of it.
1,"Typically presented, but enough with the preaching.","Grisham reaffirms his ability to spin a good yarn here, but once again you are left to sift through his developing habit of proselytizing to find the story. I read this kind of book for escapist entertainment, and I don't need John Grisham to lecture me about the plight of the homeless any more than I needed him to lecture me on the horrors of the gas chamber.This guy was a lot more fun to read when he stuck to basic issues and didn't have a morality lesson interwoven into the narrative; if I wanted to read books that embraced a political agenda, I wouldn't be buying a Grisham novel in the first place. This author is much better when he just tells a story than he is when he uses the novel for political activism."
1,So rich now he hs time to pontificate on such issues,"All I can say is one has to be rich enough to afford the time to sit back an come up with this plot line. Maybe Grisham should give away all the cash he makes off of this book to build some homeless shelters of his own. Hey John! Do not preach to me, just stick to writing legal thrillers."
4,"NOW WE THING ABOUT THE HOMELESS PEOPLE ,AND HOW THEY LIVE.","This book is not the best of Grisham. I thoroughly enjoyed this book which is fast-paced and absorbing. It is easy reading and not multi-layered, but gets you to focus on the homeless problem and start considering how fortunate you are and how you yourself can begin to make a difference. We may not all quit our jobs to help the homeless, but someone reading this might consider helping out in a food bank, shelter or contributing in other ways. Not many novels can entertain while making you reconsider your own role in society, but that is just what happens here. Iread it in spanish edition....."
4,This book has brought me back to Grisham,"After a disappointing experience with ""The Chamber,"" I have not gone back to another Grisham novel until now. I found this book to be suspenseful, interesting and entertaining. I was hooked after only reading the first few pages. Predictable? Perhaps. However, Grisham explores a subject that often goes ignored by our society and for that he is to be commended. I can't wait to read ""The Testament!!"""
4,Pretty Good Stuff,"John Grisham, while one of my favorite writers, writes a book that starts out very well, has a good structure and storyline, but sometimes moves slowly. You'll notice I gave it Four Stars. My correct rating would be ***, just for the record, good, but not Grisham's best (that's gotta be THE CLIENT or THE RAINMAKER)."
3,VERY INTERESTING,I liked the focus of this book. It makes you think of the homeless in a new way. It brings to light some of the problems the homeless face such as where to spend the night or get a meal. It really made me think.
3,"Great Grisham opening, slow reading and predictable end","After an electrifying first two chapters, I was anticipating yet another great thriller by this popular author, but the story was only interesting because of being set in the world of the homeless and even that was trite.The plot of the Street Lawyer pits wealth against poverty , rich lawyers vs the homeless.By the time it was over, I was cheering for the wealthy who had to fork over millions to satisfy an outlandish court settlement -too much like real life there. No surprises in this book. Hope his next is better."
3,A good read -- highlights the plight of the homeless,A compassionate book. Not as slick as his previous ones. The ending is well thought out. Interesting first person narrative.
4,keeps you looking around every corner for one more suprise!!,"An outstanding example of keeping the reader guessing which way this story is going to turn. I thought this was one of Grishams knights in shining armor.I could only envision James Earle Jones as Mordecai Green. **** Star rating. Read this book, you wont be dissapointed."
3,Good reading but not typical Grisham.,"Thought this was a particularly uncomfortable book to read. Anyway, I did enjoy the book as it was a slight departure from Grisham's typical fare."
3,"THIS TIME, GRISHAM WAS UNINSPIRED","I would characterize this novel as mildly interesting. Unfortunately, we have all grown to expect riveting storytelling from Mr. Grisham, therefore one inevitably feels let down by the somewhat predictable plot of THE STREET LAWYER. Grisham's novels have been often labeled as legal thrillers. Yet this story would never be characterized as a thriller; instead we are presented with a slow paced and uneventful narrative of a lawyer who suddenly is determined to fight for the plight of the downtrodden."
4,beautifully symbolic,"This is only the second Grisham book I have read and I enjoyed it. I can feel the anguish the main character feels, as he heroically deals with important issues in our society. The critics who missed the beauty of entertainment intertwined with real life problems, are an example of those who choose not to see."
2,Snoozer!,"Started of pretty interesting and went down hill from there after. The plot lacked punch and was far to predictable. Grisham spends the whole book trying to point out how white people should take the full blame for the homeless problem. This is the first book from him I have read, but due to his reputation I will give him another chance. Hopefully I will enjoy other Grisham works."
2,Grisham needs to find new formula,"I have been a fan of John Grisham's for years, but this book disappointed me. It seems that since he has moved from Oxford out to Charlottesville that he has gotten burned out writing. He seems too tired to develop. This plot follows just about every plot he has ever done: Young white male lawyer from the South, usually Memphis, gets himself into an impossible situation and struggles to find a way out. That was essentially true in all his books except for the Client when the protagonist only changed to a small boy. Come on John, I know you have it in you!!!!!!!!!Turn the page and give us something fresh for a change."
2,My Grocery List Is More Interesting Read,"I just can't believe that John Grisham is a major player in current fiction scene and is considered to be in the same league with Tom Clancy and Stephen King (though I don't like horror stories at all but at least SK knows how to form a sentence). I have read all JG's books and the only ones I enjoyed were ""The Chamber "" and ""The Rainmaker"". His worst book ever, to me, was ""The Partner"" and the ""Street Lawyer"" could be a hot contender for that position had it not been for the subject which I found thought provoking (that's why 2 stars). It seems that JG has run out of ideas (which were never abundant to him in the first place) but his books are at least serving one purpose i.e. we have one less lawyer to worry about.Sorry Mr. Grisham, but from now-onwards, you are on my ""borrow only"" authors list."
2,"His worst novel, although it did have some good parts in it.","Well, I am a big fan of John Grisham, and I have read all of his novels. I enjoyed all of his previous novels, but the Street Lawyer was not as amusing. First of all, I would like to know what kind of lawyer would want to leave his high-paying job and work for homeless people instead. And I was annoyed by how Grisham kept on saying that it's not the homeless people's fault that they are homeless. But it is their fault! They are too lazy and depend on the gov't too much. But our gov't already spends too much money on these lazy people and wastes our tax dollars! I would recommend the Chamber instead. It is a much deeper book, and the bad person actually dies in the end. Sorry Mr. Grisham, but this book was too liberal for me."
1,Getting boring now...,"I used to, no i still do, love necro and non-phixion. but this is just rubbish. each track sounds the same as the last 100 or so that have been produced in the last 2 years. yes, i agree with a few others reviewing this, ill bill is awesome and he does sound good on this album. but he is drowned out by this mr. hyde fellow. maybe its beyond my comprehension, but i can't quite understand what this guys tallent is. is he actually a rapper or is he actually a joke on the tracks? either way, he is certainly not good and if he is a joke then its only funny the first time and just painful as it goes on. it was suggested to me that it has become to hardcore for my tender old ears, but im not sure. its become to soft and is no longer shocking enough, a poor album."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!,"I could go down to my local bar and is better looking girls, doing better dances. This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. Do NOT buy this!"
4,Great HD Fireplace!,"I always like to have a fireplace at Christmas but have never actually had a fireplace so I used to use my laptop and a fireplace screensaver that I would then plug into the TV so that it gave me a larger ""fireplace"" for Christmas morning. Well I ran across this and snatched it up and I am very happy with the HD quality and fireplace selections available. I might end up using this for more than just the one day a year as originally planned. My only complaint is the music. All of it is just cheesy. I have a media center PC so I put it in that to play on my 42"" screen and then use my own music as a background and it works perfect. Kids loved it on Christmas morning and so did the Wife. For the price you can't beat it!"
4,Relaxing and fun,"I've always wanted a fireplace in my bedroom and now I have one. Well, not exactly, but close. It is one heck of a cheap thrill (and I mean this in a good way). I bought the disc for around $10 and it offers 4 or 5 different ""fires"" (including one for Holiday season). My favorites are ""Modern"" and ""Beach"". I wanted to give this a whirl before investing in one of those wall-mounted fireplaces. While this certainly doesn't generate any heat, it is fun and looks great at night on the big screen.Audio options are very nice, too. I checked out the Trailer on the disc for the other HD Moods discs and they all feature great video and relaxing audio tracks. I will probably pick up a couple more. I would like to see one that features a ""slide show"" of modern art. I know, there's probably one out there, too.If you have a quality, large screen HD and don't actually watch that much TV, this is a great way to experience something more on your set."
4,Good video and sound quality,"This is just what I wanted - no cheesy music, just a simple, clean, recording of a fireplace. The loop-around is visible, but since the video is at least half an hour before it loops, chances are you won't notice it.The only thing that would have made it better would have been a few different fireplace options - there would have been room on the disk for several."
3,Not bad for the price.,"I doesn't put out a lot of heat unless you have a plasma. :) But it works. Nice clean menu. Video quality is great!Again for the price you can't really go wrong. I only gave it 3 stars cause it didn't ""Wow"" me much."
2,Amazing. Until a PS3 update rendered it a coaster.,"The best ambient/mood video disc on the market... Now made horrible and useless because a PS3 update made this disc unwatchable on my TV. The disc worked great before the firmware update, and I'd expect much more from a Blu-ray disc manufacturer. They should stay on top of their product and make sure it is compatible with all systems at all time.I'm so angry, because I did love this disc so much. I wanted to use it for the holidays and to hang stockings from the TV... But nope.Anyhow. It's the best if you don't own a PS3. That's all I have to say about the video itself.I'm tempted to buy the newer and more expensive BD + DVD Combo Pack, hoping the newer BD is updated. I'm sure it'll be the same story though. It's truly a bummer."
5,Just right,"This was absolutely perfect. I love the five options for different fireplaces (Fireplace with holiday decoration, plain fireplace, modern, beach and castle/gothic). I just let it run on the natural sounds for the popping of the fireplace. The picture is great, and it looks so warm and toasty from my big screen tv. I would buy this for others!"
4,"So realistic, I can feel the heat",This is a well produced video. The different types of fires were amazing. The traditional fire with the crackling sound effects were stunning. You can almost imagine heat from it. I recommend it.
3,Not bad,"real nice picture. I'm not a fan of the holiday fireplace one. The sparks, crackling could be better. Only wish that this BR could have a longer loop allowing variations in a fire progression. Seems too stagnent like a short loop over and over. Nice picture and color though"
3,Caution this is not the 2 disk version!,"A paragraph above describes a blueray/dvd package Fire 2.0, and the description says 2 disks. THIS IS NOT THE 2 DISK version, this is one disk, a DVD. Link to Version 2.0:HD Moods Fire 2.0 (Blu-ray & DVD Combo Set)I returned this to Amazon and ordered the 2.0. This one is good for a DVD, thus rating it 3 stars, but the BlueRay is excellent (5 stars), fantastic on my 64"" screen as well as my 32"" screen."
1,item not as described do not buy this product,This item is not as described on the item page did not receive unit as described but some replacement. Would return but for price I got it not even worth my time do not frustrate yourself Music is also pre canned silly attempting to copy Andreas Vollenweider and not succesfully poor item
4,Good But not Great,"Overall, this product is good, but there are two things that bother me. First, it seems as if the wood is never really consumed by fire..there's not enough ""going on"" in the fire to keep it interesting - there's no progression to it. The other thing that's mildly annoying is that, while i love the natural fire sounds, it seems as if the sound is a loop, not the actual sounds of the particular fire we are watching.I want to see and hear 3 hours of a real fire..starting with it being lit, seeing it build intensity, to being tended to - including extra logs being added, and then dying down. What you have here is more of a nice, but fairly stagnant, fire."
3,Dark and Needs light,"Good overall Fireplace, slowly starts to burn out and then loops. The one thing I wanted was something a little more HD and vibrant for my fireplace and I don't think this blu-ray does that."
3,me like fire,"It's pretty straight forward....videos of a fire. There's several fireplaces to choose from, but there's no random cycle. I would prefer if it would switch fireplaces once it's loop has been run. But - for a holiday party backdrop, it did the trick!"
4,pretty good,"These strings were over all okay. The sound of them was amazing and i loved them and they are great for using the tremolo and it seems to make it easier to dive bomb and what not. tho only thing about these strings is that after 1 month, the nickel on the string at the bridge sort of just uncoiled itself and then the string went all loose. maybe it was just the set i got but if i was you, i would get 2 or 3 boxes just in case. but still over all, good strings i will be getting these for my dean for now on. dean black bolt ftw!"
5,martin--- DE,I LIKE THE STORY BECAUSE HE TOLD THE LIFE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY HIS FREINDS SAID THEY COULD NOT PLAY WITH HIM BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK.
5,"About Martin Luther King , Jr --ga","Martin Luther King , Jr was born in Atlalta , Goagia. He was born on January 15 , 1929. He led the March of Washington on August 28, 1964 and gave his speech.THe book was really great."
5,kj the king,DR.King was born in Alanta Gorgia. He like to play football &baseball. He played football in his backyeard. One day his friends couldn't play with him because he was black. He wanted to change this and changed the world.
2,Poor Vehicle for Diana Rigg,"Although Diana Rigg is an excellent actress with scope and panache, the character of Mrs. Bradley, as presented in the series, fails to heighten Ms. Riggs' excellent skills and makes her look clumsy instead of avant garde. Also the uses of sophomoric or poorly thought out attempts at ""light humor"" do not succeed in bringing balance and British wit to the script. The only saving graces found were some talented auxiliary actors and a slight resemblance to Hitchcock."
3,Entertaining,"While this was a good movie, I was able to predict the killer almost immediately. Nevertheless the costumes were beautiful and the storyline was quite entertaining."
2,Mrs Bradley mysteries,Series no way near as good as Foyle's War or the Lynley series. Diana Rigg was disappointing.
3,Pretty thin plot,For the plot to work about half a dozen people have to choose the worst of their options at several junctures in their life. Lovers of real detective fiction such as by Christie or Sayers will feel that their intelligence is being insulted. One example of an insult is that one person who took out a loan but did not spend the money could not repay the loan even if they wanted to. Another example is that the police are unable to protect someone when a known person makes a death threat against them and no legal action can be taken against the threatener.The only redeeming feature of the program is the elderly Dianna Rigg playing the part of a skinny 40 year old. Dianna is wearing very baggy clothes to hide her portly figure which makers her look even more overweight.
4,Mrs. Bradly Reviews,"I enjoy this type of mystery. It reminds me of Sherlock Homes, but has a woman lead detective and her ""helper"" is a male chuffeur. Takes a while to adjust to the British accent because I am hard of hearing anyway. If you like mysteries, you will like these stories."
4,"Oh, the hats!","There are only two downsides to this charming little mystery series - the first being that they didn't make many of them. The second was the parts where the main character spoke directly to the audience. I really thought the series could have done without the breaking of the fourth wall. It made it seem slightly cheesier, and really distracted from the otherwise very well-done mysteries.The main character (Adela Bradley) is utterly likable, as is her stalwart chauffeur. Together they form an unlikely, but very effective team. And the series really is all about they mysteries - there's not a lot of background or personal information needed to enjoy them. Everything you need to know is laid out for you in the series.Mystery fans tired of the increasing gore and adult situations in their mysteries will love this series - it hearkens back to an old-fashioned time of relatively clean and upstanding murder and mayhem..."
5,Mrs. Bradley Mysteries,"We enjoyed the series very much. After spending six years in England, Diana Rigg is very familar to us. Are there additional 'Bradley' series forthcoming?"
4,Episodes Are Amusing,"But the jewelry insurance commercial that airs before each episode is not. It actually kind of irritated me. . . a lot.Even though the mysteries and their solves are pretty convoluted, the show is definitely fun and enjoyable. The attitude and characters carry the series. I really liked the relationship between Mrs. Bradley and George Moody. It's very much like Bianca and Bernard from The Rescuers.Commercials aside, the DVDs are pretty good. If you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes, are looking for something similar, and don't mind a little silliness, you'll probably like it."
4,A must for detective fans,"Gloriously arch and polished performance from Ms Rigg as an amateur lady detective (complete with chauffeur) in an English countryhouse murder set in the 1920s. If you like the almost cosy but always complete evocation of time and place in the Poirot and Miss Marple series then this is for you. (Although you may find the pop psychology that crops up in the script a touch jarring and even anachrononistic, it's not the scriptwriters' fault - it's a feature of the original novels)."
3,Another Peak....,After finally finding a new road (Beyond Recall) and milking that road fully (Live Royal Festival Hall Vol. 1 & 2) Klaus created a concert of almost ALL samples and sound effects. Its a bit of a rough go at times but over all a good album and an interesting experiment though not totally original but new for him. Its very modern and a long way away from his seventies work but still he needs to keep growing as an artist and this may not appeal to all synth fans but its a new foot forward or maybe he's beating a sample horse to death. Different.
2,hey wake up time to die,"Any Klaus Schulze album I see in the store, i quickly buy it and to my dismay this was a total disappointment. Now I learn to be more careful. It seems that his long acid abuse has finally wrecked havoc in his brain. The only action starts in the last 20 or 15 minutes or so of this 80 minute performance, but the rest of the songs are linear and redundant. I suspect that with the duration of the music he just pressed an automatic button that programed the entire so called performance and his mind swithed off and returned back to his acid blackout. Get the early albums and avoid the late 80's and the 90's albums or you might end like him-a mindless cyborg!"
1,"Pretty cheap, does not hold my camera!","I bought this elsewhere because it was on sale but like the previous reviewer said, unless you have a very light camera don't get this. And it has to be a very light very compact camera. Even then I seriously have reservations about whether you can angle the camera at any angle except horizontal. I wanted to use it with my high zoom canon sx30is point-and-shoot but the whole camera just droops down because the locking mechanism for the angle is too weak to handle it. In fact, whether the position is locked or unlocked, you can hardly tell the difference. This tripod is not even worth the $1.99 I paid for it."
3,Not designed with heavy cameras in mind,"I demonstrate heavy video surveillance cameras all over the country, and I wanted some additional options for stands. This version I bought as a test, and it didn't work out well for me. The cameras I use are much heavier than typical point/shoot models (4-6 lbs in some cases); this stand doesn't allow the cameras to be at any angle other than flat for even a brief period, as the teeth and tightening clamps don't hold well enough.I am sure it would be good for very small, light cameras, but not for heavier use."
3,adult contemporary radio memories,"I have been hesitant to review this CD because I am by no means a Cat Stevens' catalog expert.I haven't listened to the great majority of Cat's stuff, but ""Randy"" was a wonderful, wonderful addition to adult contemporary radio when I was a kid.I wanted to turn it up every time I heard it, and I still turn it up.I bought this CD just for ""Randy.""Several musical styles are explored, and all are done with skill, but why hasn't someone else reviewed this?""Randy"" can be described only as ""simply gorgeous,"" though. You have to hear it, again and again and again."
2,Not Up to Cat's Standards,"Briefly -- be aware before you buy this that it is far from the great music Cat previously released. I am amazed at the reviews that say this is the reviewer's ""favorite,"" or that it is one of Cat's best. It simply is not. That is my opinion, and the opinion of just about every other serious Cat fan. Before you buy this album based on the reviews, consider the following: (1) if you own no CS, then look at Tea For The Tillerman, Catch Bull At Four, Mona Bone Jakon, or Teaser and The Firecat. They are better, by almost all fans' testimony. (2) If you already have the above, and you want this to round out your Cat collection, then go ahead, but be ready for a sore disappointment. It's better then your average pop, but not what we expect from Cat."
2,Stumbes with Earth,"Early Cat Stevens fans realize this was just a contract fulfillment album. Unfortunately, he didn't put much effort into it. Kind of like the 2 prior albums. Cat Stevens sort of lost his way after Buddha & the Chocolate Box."
1,Drek,"A parcel of tuneless, dreary songs sinks this mediocre album. You know that Cat Stevens's muse has flown, when one song on the album is a throwaway instrumental. The cheesy horn and string arrangements merely serve to emphasize the hollowness of the music. Not quite muzak, but close. Head straight for Stevens's earlier, inspired work (""Mona Bone Jakon,"" ""Tea for Tillerman,"" and ""Teaser and the Firecat"") and give this one a wide berth."
3,"A Mixed Bag, But Nonetheless Food For Thought","This is a compilation of articles published in FATE magazine down through the years. About half of the contributions are from 1990-forward, with some going back into the 1950s. The essays are of uneven quality, but there are some big names here-Ivan Sanderson, Karl Shuker, Jerome Clark, and Martin Caidin.Most of the essays are quite easy to digest, and are not technical in nature. They provide an overview of many of the strange and unexplained phenomena associated with the world's oceans and lakes, including strange animals, odd events, lost continents (e. g. Atlantis), etc."
3,"Churchill's angst, anguish and machinations before becoming British Prime Minister","The book starts off in an annoying way--cramming in all the real life characters who were part of Churchill's world in 1939-1940. Bear with the author, however, because he then spins an intricate story based largely on the actual history of the times. He takes you very much behind the scenes of the drama of Churchill's rise to power. OK, the author takes some historical liberties--Ambassador Kennedy is an easy target and Dobbs shoots so many arrows into him that he looks like a porcupine, but, on balance, the author deserves great credit fot making this bleak period in Chutrchill's life come alive."
2,Why a novel?,"It is not very well written, and I wonder why the author did not choose to write a history book. The subject is very interesting, but I dislike intensely this mix of facts and fantasy."
3,Winston War,"Although well written, it for me was chore to drag through, had a hard time keeping my interest,and I am a student of Churchill's life."
2,Can't recommend this one,"I have read and enjoyed two other books in the Churchill series by Mr. Dobbs, but I can not recommend this one. I stopped reading after roughly 300 pages. Mr. Churchill is barely present in the first half of the book which is taken up by minor characters and minor sub plots. Perhaps I missed out by not finishing the book but I could not see plodding through another 300 pages."
1,Long on nuance short on story.,I'm glad I got this book for free. I'd hate to think I wasted money on it.The writer spends and exorbitant amount of time describing the characters feelings and thoughts to the point that it is boring to the extreme. I didn't even make it to the end of the first section before deciding that life was too short to keep trying to read this book. Maybe if the author had Chamberlain and Churchill go after each other with broadswords and dueling pistols in the London Underground it would have at least have had a little action and been more interesting.
3,durable but could be better,"The bus is durable and hollow inside which looks like you can put passengers in. however, you can't get to the inside of the bus and put passengers which is frustrating to my 2 year old. I am still looking for a toy bus that you can actually put passengers in. oh well."
3,school bus pinch,"The bus is ok, just a word of caution - tiny fingers can get stuck between the window and the body of the bus."
1,Adorable but dangerous. Fell apart immediately!,"This is a great looking bus, BUT the two plastic panels on the top (front and back) of the bus broke off during the first few hours of play. When they fell off, eight little yellow circles which were apparently trying to hold plastic onto steel also came off, a serious hazard for any child who might put something in his or her mouth. They looked like little yellow candies. A dangerous product for children unless it will be on a shelf and not touched. Very disappointed."
3,Misused talents,The big lift is pretty boring but indiscretion of an American wife is pretty good and interesting because of Monty Clift!
2,Oh dear,"It said be the first ever person to reveiw this album, i couldn't resist.sorry.Here's my reveiw:Oh my god.I gave it a couple of stars in the hope that it's a piss take."
2,AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read!Barbara Victor seems to hate Madonna, she constantly insults her in this book. Also, the pictures are weak. There are no pictures of her as a child or anything. And Ms. Victor devotes WAYYYYYYYY too much time to analyzing the religious aspects of Madonna's life.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A Terrible Bio,"I was hoping to obtain in-depth information about Madonna's records, but instead I was exposed to writing that can be found in a typical celebrity gossip magazine. I read numerous times that Madonna lost her mother at a young age. She had a rocky relationship with actor Sean Penn. With the amazingly extensive career that the Queen of Pop has had, you'd think the author could give her writing of Madonna's life a little more pizazz.The color photos in the book are not that great either. They are mostly of her at premieres in 1999/2000.I'm sure there are better biographies that were written by people who actually did extensive research and didn't flip through a couple of tabloids."
2,Been told Before,"I should of given this book 1 star...but there wassome information that I did not know before.I felt that the book jumped alot, from her role inEvita to her childhood etc. Very, very choppy writing.I would say she got most of her info from magazinesthat I have read, I could of written the book myselfPlease do not waste your money on this book."
1,Waste of Time,"I found that reading this book has taken away hours of my life that I'll unfortunately never be able to get back. I DO NOT recommend this book at all. The way the author jumps back and forth in time is slightly irritating and the emphasis on the comparison to Evita throughout the entire book is, in my opinion, exaggerated, annoying and at times a far reach. What most disgusted me though is how the her life up until stardom is written in much more detail than her life afterwards. Important events such as the birth of her children are hardly mentioned. Not to mention the book focuses on her ""acting"" career more than on her music. If you're looking for a good bio then keep looking."
1,Blatant muck raking.,"I think it is absolutely pointless purchasing this book, I am not interested in knowing the ins and outs of someone's private life...would anybody want to inquire and go through a regular persons dirty laundry? no of course not..So why should anyone do it with Madonna? it seems like a futile attempt to muck rake if you ask me, same with other books like it. What's more, muck raking to make $$$$ from dragging Madonna's name through the mud. I bet this lady probably didn't even speak to anyone connected with Madonna but instead trawled through all the old tabloid papers relying on those soley to fill up her stupid book. She should find another way of making money, the woman is clearly clutching at straws and is desperate to make any buck through Madonna."
1,Dreadful,"It is unlikely that the author of this script even knew a good Catholic, much less knew how to write a movie about a heroic, French priest. I've only watched half-way through the series (I can't muster the forebearance to watch any more), but I wholeheartedly disagree with the reviewers who say that the Nazis are not drawn with a heavy hand. They are all portrayed as evil and nasty without the slightest hint of complexity of character. The German military chaplain is given the greatest amount of sympathy, but it's only because he's a slobbering drunk who hates the Nazis for whom he has been drafted into service. Catholicism is about a whole lot more than social justice, but this movie producer has no grasp of what that is. If you want to watch a good film about holy, Catholic priests of World War II, I recommend the Assisi Underground and The Scarlet and the Black."
3,Great composer. Decent performer.,"Great music, but a wee bit ""soft"" for my tastes. Wynton Kelly is more to my liking."
5,Powerful,"If you like powerful female singers, then The Zen Kiss is a must!Shelia Chandra is a strong and unique artist. I can't wait to order her other albums."
5,VOCAL SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES YOU CANNOT LEARN,"I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS ALBUM BY MY HIGH SCHOOL BAND DIRECTOR. HE WAS AMAZED AT HOW SHEILA CHANDRA PERFORMED AND I BECAME ENTHRALLED AS WELL. EVERYTIME SHE PERFORMS THESE CREATIONS, THEY ARE THE SAME, THAT IS AMAZING, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SPEAKING IN TONGUES TRACKS."
5,"""Amelia, You talk too much""","This is my three year old daughter's favorite book. She doesn't know that it was supposedly written as a allegory to World War II. She just likes the characters in the story. My wife and I get a kick out of it because it is just like life. ""Why don't you go down into the snake's hole and kill him"" (That's my job!) But I reply, ""Somehow I don't think that's a good idea,"" and so the story goes.Jordan likes this book so I'm not going to write in a lot of psycho-babble. Maybe she sees a problem within a family that has to be solved. And it is! Maybe she sees a threat to a family that the parents must solve. And they do! Perhaps she just doesn't like snakes and feels he got what he deserves. If you have this book, it is a classic in the true sense of the word, to be treasured."
3,"Good fable, but sexist","This is an Aesop-type fable about crows and owls outwitting snakes, but it's rather gruesome, and sexist to boot--mother crow is made out to be a hysterical fool. The male crow and owl solve the problem of snakes eating crow eggs."
5,my home town,The story took place in the town my children grow up it. I bought two one for each child. They loved it too.
5,A Unique Read by a Unique Man,"Mr. Aldous Huxley is best known for is earth shattering book A Brave New World. But in his spare time he penned this story for his young niece, Olivia de Haulleville, as a Christmas gift. He draws off of Olivia's actual neighbors and neighborhood to create a familiar fun characters and environment that any child could enjoy.Almost destroyed in a fire in 1963, this story has been recently recovered and published with illustrations by Sophie Blackall. Blackall's illustrations perfectly encapsulate the writing of Huxley's words in a fun childlike art that begs for continued examination.A fun and witty read for both children and adults, this Aldous Huxley's only Children's Book is a great one to add to your library."
3,Good and not so good,"This book is beautifully (or humorously) illustrated, and the conversations between the characters are lively. However, I find certain lines rather rude and I certainly would not tell the story verbatim, such as when Mr. Crow said to Mrs. Crow ""...I didn't think your idea was a very good one. Your ideas are seldom good, I may add. That's why I shall go and talk to my friend..."" and the repeated ""you talk too much... keep your beak shut...""I'm torn whether to keep this one.."
1,Gruesome and wholly unsuitable for children of any age,"This was a horrid little book written by Huxley in the darkest days of World War II for a young relative. Poor girl! The story is an obvious parable about Nazi Germany and the horrors of war. A nasty snake eats the babies of Mrs. Crow. So Mrs. Crow bands together with other animals and tortures the snake to death, using its corpse in a ""funny"" way at the end. Ha Ha. Complete with Barbara Cooney's graphic illustrations. Maybe this kind of heavy-handed stuff was ""amusing"" during the war, but it seems just grusome to the point of obscene today. This book scared the hell out of me as an 11 year old in 1973. It still does. Interesting for adult students of Huxley, and that's about it. Forget it for kids."
5,Beautiful Melodies lost in History,"This collection of music, though nearly 100 years-old, is still bound nicely. We had never heard of more than a half the tunes, which are all beautiful. While most of the lyrics are overly romantic and don't appeal to contemporary taste, the melodies are delightful and representative of many Western European cultures. It's easy to visualize life at a slower pace, when entertainment consisted of gathering around the piano to sing about life's loves and losses. We recommend it to any instrument player, especially those with romantic inclinations."
5,GREAT BIOGRAPHY OF A GREAT PLAYER,"The book, Kareem!: Basketball Great is a wonderful book. The book provides a look into his childhood, where he struggled to fit in because of his height, Also, it tells of how he envisioned California as a great place but upon arrival at UCLA he hated it. His struggles with the national attention he recieves and the immaturity of his dormmates. The book gives a view of the beginning of his pro career with the Milwaukee Bucks. I give the book 5-Stars and recommend it to all sports fans."
4,Good simple reference tool,Divided into sections to use as a quick reference for various business situations. Great tips
2,Beware of Deerso if you order a lawnboy,I Purchased a lawnboy from Deerso through amazon online as a birthday gift for a friends mother who had a broken lawnmower. I told the mother and friend it would arrive in a few days as that's what the website said when I checked out. Two weeks went by. It never showed up. Deerso never sent the item and amazon help said that deerso canceled the order and did not notifiy anyone. No phone call. No email. Nothing. They did not tell me or the person it was going to who now has two foot grass and is angry with me. Amazon thought deerso was probably out of stock as they quit selling the particular model I ordered that week. Because of the way the order was canceled it's not possible to give deerso direct feedback as a seller- but beware.
1,Don't forget to leave your door unlocked,"Teenaged vixens?It is not that farfetched!Starts off hokey - gets weirder.There is an actual problem with the film and it is not the cheesy dialog or the inept special effects. It is the fact that they are too obviously contrived for the film. They try too hard to be campy and it shows. They try to make ""Old School"" films. What we need are fresher tomatoes.So what's in your garden?"
1,Again I wish for a zero star rating,"This movie is so bad on so many levels it defies description. It does not work well as an attempt to be another plan 9 from outer space which the director must have been trying copy. I have no idea why this is an unrated disk, there is no nudity in movie. It should have been rated ""G"". Save your time and money and look else where."
5,This film will grab your heart and warm it right up!,This film touched me more that almost any film I have ever watched. A man loses the love of his life and unknowingly falls in love with the recipient of his dead wife's heart. A group of older and wiser men do what they can to see the young couple through the difficulties they encounter. Carrol O'Conner and Robert Loggia deliver memorable performances and two of that group of older men. You will never regret watching this film. I promise!
5,Return to Me,"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. We had seen it on TV years ago. Great chick flick and a real ""feel good"" movie in the vein of ""Sleepless in Seattle."" The tragedy of a lost love followed by a newfound love with a different twist. A much different kind of role for Duchovny than gun toting X-Files fed. The old guys including Carroll O'Connor were delightful."
5,A must have movie,"The moie, ""Return to Me"", is one that I have always loved. Funny, romantic and a great pick-me-up movie to see with or without someone cuddling near you!"
2,I wanted to like this movie,"I enjoy Bonnie Hunt's work and expected a lot more out of this movie. There is no chemistry between David Duchovny and Minnie Driver, and the obstacle the couple must overcome in the ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back"" formula is entirely predictable. Of all people, I think James Belushi was the highlight of ""Return To Me."" If you're looking for a romantic comedy in which the leads actually seem attracted to each other, try ""While You Were Sleeping"" with Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock. Coincidentally, it's also set in Chicago."
1,Return To Me,"I got my DVD and when I tried to play it, it would not play. It kept telling me it was the wrng Number Region and when I emailed the shipper I never got a reply, so I was not happy with my DVD. I am sorry this happened because I have always had good luck with Amazon and was disapointed. Joan Wilson"
2,"Ok, but not very strong.","Typical sappy romantic comedy. Funny on the veterans part. I didn't see the chemistry everyone was talking about between Duchovny and Driver. I just thought two better actors with better chemistry could've played it better. For the saps, this is a good one. For the others, I'd stick with the classics."
2,Duchovny is the worst actor on the screen today...,"The movie was a fairly well made movie. The story was very creative and sweet. HOWEVER: I am now convinced that David Duchovny is the WORST actor on the screen today (Please understand that I am a HUGE fan of his X-Files work). He will never shake the ""Agent Mulder"" vibe (I now realize he is a one dimensional actor). The rest of the acting was very good, but is almost neutralized by Duchovny. There is absoloutely NO ROMANTIC CHEMISTRY between Minnie Driver and Duchovny. Quite simply put: Duchovny is sole reason I gave this movie ""2 Stars"" instead of ""3""."
1,"Dull, dull, dull, dull, dull","There's a reason why movies have conflict - it's to keep the audience engrossed (and awake). In this unfunny dud of a romantic comedy however there is nothing to keep the lovers apart, so they invent a totally silly hang-up for her and have him respond out of character when the 'big' secret of Minnie Driver is revealed. The only saving graces are Jim Belushi's belly and some Sinatra and Martin songs integrated in the plot. Duchovny and Driver generate as much excitement as drying paint. Totally unexceptional and boring."
5,You can't help but love this movie...,"'Return to Me' never fails to put a smile on my face and a warm feeling in my heart. It is so well acted, written, filmed... you get drawn into the world these characters live in and at the end feel reluctant to leave.This movie is very real, and it puts you through an emotional rollar coaster. You are grinning happily one minute, and sobbing the next... just to get picked right back up.Its a movie that anyone can watch. Young, old or in between... everyone will enjoy it. You just don't find movies like this any more. Its one the whole family can sit down and watch together."
4,Return to me,Fast delivery! There is a point in the movie that it stops because of scratches in the disk....but not that big of a deal! Great buy!
2,It never arrived.,"I ordered the movie, and I followed the tracking via US Postal and it never arrived so I requested a refund."
4,Love and Kindness,This is a delightful movie of all types of love and kindness. I enjoyed watching a movies full of chuckles and humanity.
3,It's OK For a Night At Home,"I think one may like this film more than others do if one is already a big David Duchovny fan. I have friends who are huge fans of his X Files show and I'm sure they would love this film. However, for me this plays more like a made-for-tv movie than a full theatrical release. The hero loses his wife in an auto accident and his wife's heart is donated to the heroine. These two later become engrossed in an incredibly sentimental romance, verging on the maudlin, without knowing each other's relation to his late wife's heart. My husband took one brief look at the film and promptly left the room to let me finish this ""chick film"" alone. So I don't hold out a lot of hope for this as a date movie. To be fair, it probably is more like a 3.5 or C+ kind of movie than a straight C. I liked Minnie Driver much better in ""Ideal Husband"" with Rupert Everett but it could be that Everett is a much more talented leading man and brought out the best in her."
2,Terrible commentary!,"The movie itself is fine. A light romantic comedy with the always appealing Minnie Driver.But as DVD audio commentaries go, this is one of the worst commentaries I have listened to. For the first 15 minutes, the director and co-writer hardly say anything. And when they do speak, it's usually to make some sort of stupid joke (""That crowd is computer generated!"").After awhile they warm up and start to actually provide interesting info about the making of the movie, but it's too little, too late. Don't buy this DVD if you are looking forward to great Bonnie Hunt commentary."
4,Sweet & Funny,"Bonnie Hunt is my hero. An effortless scene stealer whatever the film (""Beethoven"", ""Jerry Maguire"", ""The Green Mile""), she proves with ""Return to Me"" that she is also a gifted director and writer. In this sweet film of fate and love, Hunt and writing partner Don Lake (watch for his cameo as the ""hair guy"" at the bar!) take an original idea and give it life- great characters, great lines, and great performances from the entire cast (Hunt is actually the standout, along with James Belushi as her husband). ""Return to Me"" is the type of feel-good movie that you want to watch over and over again. It won't win awards, but that doesn't always determine a film's value."
4,Romantic Comedy at it's Best (Or second best),"David Duchovny and Minnie Driver share the lead in this romantic comedy directed by Bonnie Hunt. Duchovny is not one who typically is considered a romantic lead, but with the help of Minnie Driver and Bonnie Hunt he turns in a solid performance. The supporting cast truly makes this film a winner. Carroll O'Conner, Robert Loggia, and their fellow cronies provide numerous big laughs throughout the movie. While some may argue that the combination of Duchovny and Driver results in a lukewarm on-screen relationship, I found them to have a unique and charming rapport. Well worth watching and more than once."
5,Just a plain old feel-good movie,"I just watched this movie for the first time last week. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Some drama, sad times, romance and comedy. I loved the ""senior citizens"" in this movie. When they danced along to Frank Sinatra, it cracked me up. What a nice story. I wish we could have more movies of this calibur!"
5,I fell in love with EVERYONE in this film,"When Return to Me hit theaters the most often heard remark about the film made to me was ""the married couple is you and your husband"" or words to the effect. So when I saw it I said ""how did Bonnie Hunt get into my house and record my life?"" She didn't, of course, but you can imagine that made me pre disposed to love this movie. And I do. I can watch it with my children, I can watch it with my inlaws, I can watch it with my mother, and I am never embarrassed by it.The sound track is phenominal. What fabulous music!! I hear that soundtrack a lot at wedding receptions. . .how much more romantic can ya get? Carroll OConnor and Robert Loggia make the movie for me and my family. As the grandfather and uncle by marriage of the lead character, Gracie, OConnor and Loggia give genuinely loving performances. This film not only affirms that some love is meant to stay with you always but that we make our family and they love us.Add this film to your chick flick library."
4,My Sensitive Side,"This is probably the most bizarre review I've written considering the reviews I tend to write. But, why not, right? I'm not too full of macheesmo to admit watching and liking a good ol' romance film from time to time. I usually drive my wife to the brink of madness by making her watch films like Death Wish 3 and Zombie Holocaust, but there are times when the soft side of me takes over and I surprise her by bringing home something like this. I was very happy with my selection this time. Return To Me doesn't have an awful lot new to offer in terms of a love story plot outside it's ""twist"", but it's well done. Practically every character is very likeable, it's romantic, it's interesting, and..........well, you just can't help but like it. So, if you're a guy and you have a night alone with your girlfriend, wife or mistress, forget your copy of Tango & Cash and give this a whirl. Neither of you will be sorry."
4,A fun romantic comedy,"I really don't care for movies in this genre but I watched it because David Duchovny was in it. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.The story is not ""saccharinely"" sweet as so many of this type are. The humor is very real life and not contrived just to make the audience laugh because something funny happened but laugh because life is so like that.The characters are developed well, even the supporting cast. The film makes you care for each of them and feel as if you know them.Yes, the story line...man loses wife to tragedy, woman gets wife's heart as a transplant, man and woman meet and fall in love...is not very plausible, but most things out of Hollywood hardly are. At least this time it comes off as believable."
4,Return to a Good 'ol Fashion Love Story,"RETURN TO ME is a ""not too over the top"" romantic comedy with some pathos (Okay! It could be a tearjerker at times!) and a very likeable cast. Good to see Carroll O'Conner in one of his last film roles and a good supporting cast with Robert Loggia (INDEPENDENCE DAY, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS), Bonnie Hunt (who also directed), James Belushi, and David Alan Grier (tv's IN LIVING COLOR). David Duchovny and Minnie Driver pull off the lead roles in a story of a ""will they or will they not get together"" plot and have very good on screen chemistry. In fact the whole cast has pretty good chemistry. The Chicago setting and the Irish/Italian restaurant bar is very atmospheric. All around very entertaining film with a top notch cast and very good performances all around. Worth a second look because there are some pretty good plot intricacies, humor, characters to care about and a great soundtrack."
1,Can not play.,"It is not for the US format, but for Europa or for the Mars.This is the first time that I encountered such an outlandish error with you. I will think twice before I order another DVD through you.I am returning it.The movie's rating is 4 stars.Mamoru Ogata"
1,movie,"daughters favorite movie we got if for her for christmas ,when we went to play it came up with that we are in the wrong region to play this movie it was in german. also the website said it was in english .only gaveit one star to write the review."
4,Superb romantic comedy,"This film is one of the best ""old-fashioned"" romantic comedies to have been made in recent years!. Once you get over the slightly far-fetched set-up for the movie (guy falls in love with woman who has his dead wife's heart!), then just sit back and enjoy. Duchovny is surprisingly good, and Minnie Driver is not only excellent, but incredibly sweet with it, and any guy who thinks otherwise must have a heart of stone!. The supporting cast is also excellent, which includes Bonnie Hunt (who also directed and co-wrote the film), Carroll O'Connor, Robert Loggia and James Belushi - all are great. There's not too much in the way of DVD extra's, though the commentary track is definitely worth a listen.Along with ""Love and Sex"", this is one of the most overlooked films from the last few years (in the UK at least). An endearing movie - without being too schmaltzy - this is one that both women and men should check out."
4,"Great actors, weak commentary","Others here ... have told you how great the movie is, and I agree. My review is about the commentary track by Bonnie hunt and Don Lake. After all, that is the main reason many people buy DVDs - for the special features. Bonnie Hunt has this habit of allowin very long pauses in the commentary track while she watches the movie, which has the volume turned dowm low because we are not supposed to be listening to the movie while you are supposed to speak, dear Bonnie. Don Lake is almost non-existant in the commentary, allowing Bonnie to run the whole track. There were many times when I wanted her to give insider information of what was happening, but her inside info was limited to telling which of her many relatives she cast in what roles. If you are buying this movie just to watchthe move, it's worth it. If you are buying it for the extras, don't bother."
2,I wanted to like this....(SPOILER ALERT),"because of the cast perhaps. However, I found the premise to be far fetched and the conclusion too predictable. The story is tedious and frustrating because I could not appreciate the conflict. If the wife was an organ donor who died an accidental death and her heart had to be given to someone to save a life, then what is the problem? It may be kind of eery to know the person who has your deceased loved one's organ, but other than that I did not see an issue substantial enough to carry a movie for two hours (or what seemed like longer)."
3,My mistake,"While the VHS tape I purchased was in good shape, I meant to order it in DVD so I was a little embarrassed that I accidentally purchased the VHS tape. Fortunately I have a DVD/VCR combo and could still watch it. The movie had a couple of flaws but for the most part it was in good condition."
5,Love IT!,This movie is so so so so wonderful!I would recommend this movie to anyone I know.It's the sweetest and the most romantic movie you could ever see!! See It!
4,"An fine emotion driven, psychologically focused mystery.","An Unsuitable Job For A Woman is a dark, subtly erotic duo of mysteries on three video tapes. The private detective, Cordelia Gray, attempts to solve murder cases through the use of typical clues and through the use of the emotional states of the other characters. Cordelia is an imperfect person with a traumatic past. This makes her a very interesting detective. This mystery is a thinking person's adventure. It is for those of you who do not want to have to check your brains in at the box office. I highly recommend AN UNSUITABLE JOB FOR A WOMAN."
1,"If the tapes were complete, the rating would be higher","I've enjoyed most of PD James' books so I was pleased to buy the PBS video. However, I was very disappointed to watch these tapes. As the previous reviewer wrote, the tapes are incomplete. Do not buy this version. You will only be frustrated. Stick with the books!"
1,Don't buy these tapes - they are incomplete,"The box advertises this set as two tales - a three part and a two part. The total run time is 330 minutes and is comprised of two tapes. However, each tape is only 55 min long - so there should be six tapes. The first two tapes are parts I and II of the first tale, then tape III is part I of the second. Obviously something is missing. And yes, we fast forwarded to the end after committing two hours to watch 2 of 3 episodes and then not to be able to finish is disappointing as best."
1,What a let down,"This second series of C. Gray stories are worthless. They do not have any real suspense, character development, or plot. Even the sound and cinematography stink. What a let down! First set of C. Gray mysteries are absolutely wonderful however. See the review for them."
3,Wasn't WOW for my wife,"Although it was fun, it wasn't the earth shattering and WOW experience the other reviewers had. It was fun, but not that big of deal. It'd be fun to be surprised with it as a husband, though."
5,More than just good bar tape.,"Yes this is durable bar tape in line with the stuff they made in the 70s/80s. I, however think it is a great product for other things as well. I have wrapped this stuff around my chainstays as a chainstay protector; I have wrapped older flat-bar handlebar grips with this to give them a new look; and I have used it to protect my bike frame when adding a kickstand (wrapping a layer between the frame and the kickstand). It is also good for wrapping u-locks when the sun starts to age the rubber/plastic causing it to sweat something sticky."
3,a long drawn out set of movies,"We have to murders and two murders, but the drama is so long drawn outthat the interest in the dry mystery sort of wains over time.The strange fellow who murders his prostitute aunt and is gotten off by thefemale barracuda lawyer for criminal defense who thinks winning isas important as justice. She alienates just about everybody around herfrom her daughter to the cleaning lady. Her murder is the firstand the cleaning lady is the second.The investigator solves both murders, but is only able tobring the cleaning lady's murder to conclusion.I didn't particularly like this mocking of the criminal justice system."
5,A Certain Justice,"P.D. James' mysteries rank as outstanding entertainment. This CD featuring Roy Marsden as Adam Dagliesch is excellent. It has well developed characters, a complex plot involving actions that took place years before, and scenes in both London and on England's coast. I highly recommend this product."
3,A Certain justice,I liked the masterpiece theater episodes and enjoyed it again. Roy Marsden not my favorite Dalgleish but everyone else splendid
5,"Timeless beautiful, haunting, danceable, beyond categories","I have listened to this awsome recordings for 20 years and it still sounds vital, innovative and fun. It has Wobble''s bass lines as the backbone for beautiful guitar notes + chords, evocative samplings and studio textures, and pianos, french horns, and Wobbles elocuent verses.This music will make you imagine a million places, mystery films, markets, chance encounters, half open doors and exotic worlds. But most importantly your hips and your feet will move to primal beats of Jaki and wobbles outer space fat dub bass!"
3,OK,This book is ok....I mean i wouldnt read it if i didnt have to (we had to read it for school).......well some ppl might like it..but i am more into fiction books.......teh book was well writen........
4,Mirren commands the screen!,"Helen Mirren routinely devastates her audience with her amazing screen presence, glamour and talent. In this elaborate mystery she goes undercover and penetrates the world of international art thievery. Mirren more than once is filmed in reference to a renowned painting--something you would not expect on Masterpiece theatre but rather in an art film.The story is suspenseful and the twists are very well done. If I have any critique, I would suggest trimming about 20 minutes out and thereby not drawing out the suspense quite so far. This two part series is 208 minutes and would have had a little more edge if it had been slighly briefer. But this is just quibbling. This is a quality television movie and certainly worth seeing."
4,Helen Mirren shines again,"The Painted Lady is a marvelous movie in which Helen Mirren delivers a ferocious performance as a former blues singer in search of the killers of her landlord. Her portrayal alone, which spans the spectrum of human emotion from roaring rage to wounded pain deserves an Emmy. The plot at times get a little murky, but stick with Mirren everytime and she'll show you what is still good about television."
5,A real treat!,"Another brilliant and entertaining British mystery.There is something here for everyone. Helen Mirren is, as always, superb. There is a wonderful attention to detail,and delightful character development. As the story unfolds, there are enough twists and turns to intrigue the most sophisticated of mystery fans. Tired as I was when I saw this, I could not tear myself away, and finally and wisely bought my own copy so that I could watch again without missing a moment. Treat yourself to a great evening of entertainment. You'll find yourself watching this one more than once."
4,A Mirren Vehicle,"I love Helen Mirren in almost anything, with the caveat that she wears me out. With the exception of ""The Queen"" she is so uptight in ALL roles that I must watch her in small doses. This is a good movie, the camera never leaves Mirren's face (shades of Prime Suspect), sets and scenes are lush, but Helen PLEASE, simmer down. I feel your pain, angst, anger, surprise, lust, but ask the cameraman to give other actors a chance to react with the camera on them. Other than my complaints, this is a good evening with Helen (and others)."
2,Painted Lady,This was a movie that I couldn't wait to end. It was long and rather depressing and certainly not up to our expectations of a Helen Mirren movie. Prime Suspect series were great but this one can't even be in the same category of her talents.
2,Painted Lady --- Boring Lady!,"Nothing but a star vehicle for Mirren. No wonder she is a co-producer. She overacts like it's going out of style. Story line totally ludicrous, windier than the top of a hill, hideous music. I am sorry I purchased it."
1,Mer De Noms,"This is simply an import, not any sort of real boxed set. It comes in different packaging, which makes it a boxed set. There are no additional tracks, just the CD that can be purchased here in the USA."
3,"Product good, support snag","Got this in addition to Fretboard Logic (which is excellent), this DVD seems to have more detail/exercises for half the price, but the second DVD is defective; took a little while to hear from Desi, will update review when I get a replacement disc"
1,BEWARE YOU'LL GET RIPPED OFF,"I ordered this as a download from his website thinking I would get this pretty quick. The download didn't work, so I emailed Desi several times to get help. No response, so now I want my money back. It's been a month now and still no response to my emails. Desi sure took my money pretty quick though! Desi get your email fixed! Also don't get sucked in by all of those high reviews of his stuff - I found out they are not all true after I had ordered this. DESI, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
5,Passion,"Desi has an extremely strong passion for teaching guitar. His videos are very easy to understand, but are excellent for the intermediate to advanced guitar player. He doesn't waste time with boring concepts and follows up consistently to make sure you understand what he is teaching. It is like having your own personal instructor. Especially in a very impersonal internet age, Desi reaches out and goes above and beyond. Check him out at http://Guitar-Music-Theory.com"
5,Very Helpful,"This has made understanding the guitar much easier, especially for someone like me who has been playing for over 40 years."
3,"Great CD, but not even barely house...","This is a great compilation of new and old Latin tracks - and being a fan of both, I am happy to have it in my collection, but if you're really looking for House this isn't your disc. There are all of about 5 four on the floor cuts and only one of those, Cricco Castelli's 'Batacuda Soul' is worth it's salt in moving bodies. What it does have is a really nice selection of quality Salsa and even some nice Brazillian flavor. So if you're looking for that lovely house track, stick to Masters At Work... but grab this for an uptempo intro to Latin styles of all colors."
2,"This article is very ""inconclusive.""","It says the same thing that doctors tell women who are either trying to get pregnant or are. Results are inconclusive. They say Wellbutrion or buprion is ""safe,"" but they don't know for sure. As for good ole' ritalin or concerta SR, they really can't tell because some of the women tend to abuse it. That's all it says, ladies! What a waste of money!"
2,too large and cheaply constructed,You definitely get what you pay for here. This is much bigger than it needs to be for a standard sized badge. And it doesn't curve to follow the contour of your arm. Kind of annoying. I had to staple the strap together after the first time I used it. Spend the extra money to get something of a higher quality.
3,"Reasonable price, fair outdoor plastic, low quality tape.","This is the first year of 3 that I have used this brand. Like the indoor kits a bunch, the outdoor kits are good also, with ample plastic and tape, but the tape does not stick as well as previous brands I have used, namely 3 m. I had only one window really pull up last year, and that was in 30 mile an hour winds. So far I have had 4 windows to re-touch the tape up on. They appear to be holding for now, but I hope they withstand the winter. Check around, but these will do if you have very good, dry and clean window sills. My window sills are older paint, and the stick factor is low with this brand of tape. Should do fine for most folks."
4,Like them,"I bought these for my mom as part of her stocking stuffer. She loves them, however, I think they are a tad too small. I know I know, the measurements are in the description.. They do the job and the recipient was happy. I give it four because whenever I use them I feel like they hardly soak up before I can finish drying the dishes."
3,Thin And Small...,"I don't know that I would categorize these as dish cloths. They're only slightly larger than a washcloth, and they're made of a very flimsy material. While they come in a cute little package, that doesn't do much for the actual functionality of the product. I purchased these as food photo props, so they'll work fine for me, but I wouldn't recommend these to anyone looking to use them in their kitchen or for drying dishes. They're far too small and thin."
3,Waffle Dish Cloths,"Dish cloths are out of fairly thin facric, but will work. Colors are good and match other purchases I made. Not sure why the Oriental take out box package?"
3,too small and not absorbant enough to be dish towels,these are more like fancy napkins - they aren't big or absorbant enough to be good dish towels. . .
4,"Nick Stone the Human, not Nick Stone the Soldier","Last Light is the fourth in the series of books written by Andy McNab. The whole series of books is great and this is no exception. Andy McNab obviously decided when writing this book that he needed to give his character some extra depth. In this book we see Nick Stone make some serious human decisions.After reading this book you come away with a lesson in survival, in a way it teaches you jungle tracking skills and gives you a good insight into how special operations are coordinated. If you're an SAS or any kind of Special Forces enthusiast it's a good read just to get inside the mind of a professional elite soldier.I enjoyed this book greatly, the plot keeps you guessing, and its never obvious what's going to happen. Am not going to spoil the book am sure if you want to find out what its about you just read the Amazon.com review but if you enjoyed the rest of the Nick Stone series this book is going to make you very happy.4 Stars"
3,Bought it long time ago,Its a good book if you are into action and war stories. I bought it after reading a couple other books from the author...And im not a reader
5,great,"hey, it's two of us. We just finished reading the awesome book what a girl wants. It's great. It's helped us through everything: boy trouble, zits, friends, stress, family, pets, nail polish, hair, shyness, emotional rescue, being organized, shaping up, nutrition, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, three meals a day, smoothies, do-it-youself, personality collages, relationships, even with myself, how to make hip hair accesories, what to do w it medium, short, or long hair, serious skin and body care, what to do if i have oily skin, what to do if i have dry skin, what to do if i have normal skin, to exfoliate or to exfoliate, how to make a honey moisture mask for dry skin, and we left out a few, but basically it is my bible and it has taught me how to live me life.it has taught me stuff that my history teacher, mrs. gagnon, couldn't have! I LOVE THIS BOOK, and i LOVE YOU KAREN!!sorry i'm getting a little emotional. ok, bye!"
4,a view of life under Mao,an online friend suggested that I might find this an interesting read...It turned out to be much more than that. It is a fascinating look at a world I never knew. The memory of this man's struggles will stay with me a long long time. His willingness to show us how a man must sometimes compromise his ideals in order to escape from an impossible situation should be a lesson to all of us. It has given me aew appreciation of the benefits of our system of government which we so often merely accept without a thought.
5,A Young Man Survives Dangerous China Cultural Revolution,"The 1966-76 Cultural Revolution is a blot on Chinese history, a time when youth ran amok humiliating or killing the remaining middle class businessmen, doctors, lowyers and academics. to grip the country in chaos and fear. As a Chinese emigre, I was initially reluctant to recall this disastrous period. But, as I read Dr. Shen's harrowing experiences, I was thrilled by the triumph of his spirit and intellect. His fast moving narrative shows us the inner dynamics of the painful emergence of the nation that will dominate Asia, and seriously effect us all. I highly recommend his book to every throughtful reader."
4,very helpful,"I don't know how well this book would hold up in more advanced French courses, but it got me through my first year of French. There are a few words that I wasn't able to find in this dictionary, but I did perfectly fine with the words that it does have. The list of irregular verbs is nice, too."
4,Great Book,The Random House Basic Dictionary of French was a great book. I highly recomend this book. There were only a few words not in it.
2,Printed version of MSDN Library CD and Internet,"These books have the same information of MSDN Library CD and Internet Site. For that one who has access to them, these books are almost useless."
5,A,This is a very useful book for an aspiring systematic investor. This book builds a foundation of how to think about building a viable trading system. The material in this book is very detailed and easy to follow. The author gets some criticism on the actual triggers he proposes but in my opinion definitions of such triggers are largely up to the system developer. This book's value is in giving the reader a clear and comprehensive framework for testing such triggers and developing them into viable trading systems. I highly recommend this book. I found it very valuable.
3,Beyond Technical Analysis : How to Develop and Implement a W,I found this book helpful in formulating ideas in how to develope trading systems.It could have been formated better to make reading easier.The formula's should have been written in both Metastock and Easy language code.
1,hahaha,"ok...im 14 yrs old so ill admitt these guys arent exactly in my listening range, but my radio station does these ""blasts from the past"" deals where they play old songs, i fell in love with pulling muscles from a shell, in my opinion...GAP oughtta make a commercial from this song cuz it kicks....seriously"
4,Great!,Squeeze is an amazing band with all kinds of awesome. A must have for people who love some New Wave nuggets.
5,Fun and maturity,"To me, Squeeze represented all that was right about the British New Wave/No Wave movement of the late 70s and early 80s. (Note, I say early 80s--this cd doesn't contain any of the songs from Sqeeze's reunion albums of the late 80s, most of which can be safely dismissed.) Singles ""45's and Under"" doesn't omit anything that any Squeeze fan would miss.Each of these songs showcase the amazing songwriting talents of Difford and Tilbrook, and the tremendous talent of the musicians. Squeeze could always be relied upon for perfect polish, mature and above-average intelligence lyrics, FUN, and a lack self-importance and pompousness that others of the era smacked of. Each song is a hit. Nothing is a miss."
5,All greatest hits albums should be like this one,"Catchy melodies, clever lyrics, great musicianship...I can't believe it took me so long to get a copy of this on CD. Difford & Tilbrook may not be quite Lennon & McCartney, but they do a pretty good job in their own right. The songs that resonate the best (""Tempted"", ""Black Coffee In Bed"")are the ones that show Squeeze deviating from their good-natured goofy playfulness and starting to (dare I say it) explore deeper emotions. I always thought Squeeze was a great band who deserved to release better albums than they did, but when you can collect the best in one place, best to grab that one and wait for a second volume some day."
4,Wonderful & melodic pop music - 4.5 Stars,"Nothing particularly deep or long-lasting -- just wonderful melodies, singing, musicianship, and production values...Ranks up there with the group, Crowed House.Cheers."
3,An Entertaining Adventure,"This review concerns the original 1934 edition. The search for a missing witness leads Frank, Joe and Mr. Hardy to Mexico. I'd more accurately give the book 3.5 stars. The book; although not quite as well written as earlier volumes, was loaded with action and adventure. Chapters 15-23 were very good; however the final two chapters were a major letdown, as the mystery was resolved much too soon. One thing that I did not like about the book was that after the first few of chapters, none of the Hardy's friends were included in the mystery. But still, it was a good book; definately worth reading."
3,"Once Again, Modernization Compromises Art","As with other books in this series, the Depression-era originals had been rewritten in the 1960s to revive the acceptability of this venerable series.The improvements are welcome, in some instances, but by and large they serve to undercut the artistic integrity of ""F.W.Dixon's"" work on the originals.In this book in particular, Dixon's carefully wrought phonetics of Mexican speech are completely lost. If at all possible get a copy of the original and compare them - you'll see what I mean.The bigest loss: Dixon's brilliant metaphorical used of the mark on the door (hence the title) and the misguided ""reformation"" of the one true Catholic church by Martin Luther. It was no coincidence that Dixon placed this story in the heavily-Catholic Mexican province of Meztazlan, and showed that only a force of evil posts things on doors.Well, it's still fun to read, but not what it once was.That's all I'm saying, OK?"
3,Above Average,"This review concerns the revised 1967 edition. The Hardys and Chet go to Mexico to search for a missing witness in a stock-fraud case on which Mr. Hardy is working. Their search takes them to the desert and mountain regions of Baja California; where they come upon a village terrorized by a mysterious symbol carved into the doors of peoples homes and a ruthless criminal who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Much of the beginning of this book is similar to the original; however, the ending has been completely rewritten. The book is rather good and I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars. There is a moderate amount of action and the plot is interesting. I found the book made good use its mexican setting and the writing was fairly descriptive. It was a good book that is definately worth reading."
3,Pretty good...,"Now, the PCAT as I see it, is basically a useless test which I hope will someday die a horrible, horrible death. In the meantime, I think this book really helped with getting to know the overall format. I do have to agree with a previous reviewer; the reading comprehension wasn't nearly as hard as the actual test. However, everything was relatively similar. Heck, I even found a question very similar to one in the guide on the test. I highly suggest buying this book. It really prepares you pretty well."
1,Useless,"Hardly anything that I studied in this book was even asked on the PCAT. The Biology in this book covered mostly General Bio, but the PCAT was mostly on Physiology. The math was a billion times harder on the PCAT. Beware...the PCAT has calculus and geometry problems that this book did not cover. The chemistry was also a lot more difficult and was more understanding than quantitative. I definitely do not recommend this book!!!"
1,from a recent PCAT test taker,I studied this book backwards and forwards and found that the questions on here are way too easy. The real PCAT are much harder. Don't buy this book and expect to breeze through the PCAT because it is definitely not a good representation of the real exam.
2,"pick answer ""D!""","Working through this book, I noticed a huge trend in many of the sections. If there is an ""all of the above"" or ""none of the above"" option listed on the multiple choice questions, chances are, that is the answer. The main theme of this books seems to be; when in doubt, choose answer ""D."" I did find that some of the questions were poorly written, especially in the biology section. In terms of the other sections, they are written better. Choose this book if you need a quick refresher."
2,A book I wish I could return.,"This is a thin little book that did not help me with the PCAT. I scored in the 99th percentile overall only because my undergraduate education was comprehensive and rigorous. The topics outlined for the various PCAT sections are inaccurate at best. To prepare well, get a good undergraduate education, review old college texts and notes, and do as many practice questions from as many sources as possible."
3,Not recomanded,"This book is over rated, I think it only deserve a 3 star because it's all prep test questions in the book and it's a lot easier than the actual test, it does help but not as much."
1,Keep your expectations low.,"Seriously. Don't expect too much from this book or you will begreatly disappointed. As per other reviews, it's just good forpracticing more problems to prepare for the exam; that's why it deserves only 1 star -- it serves just that purpose but doesn't go beyond that. But keep on your toes -- I'ved noticed several errors in the answer sections. This should not be considered a review book be/c it does not contain any review of all the subjects you should know. It's just a slew of questions (not even definitively PCAT questions) and that's what I bought it for -- to adapt myself to a greater range of test questions. Find it at your local library if you can."
3,Careful.,"I use this book and another to help me study for the PCAT. Although this book is a good guide, it does have a few problems. It is really simplified compare to the real PCAT and there are no useful tips or study materials (facts) provided to study for the material needed to prepare for the PCAT. However, it does give a good overview of what to expect on the test and also what to do in applying for pharmacy school."
4,Very Good,"I recently took the PCAT using this book as my primary source of instruction and I must say that I was very impressed. Barron's provides a comprehensive and accurate outline of study material for each of the sections on the test. The book also provides about 100 practice questions on each section, as well as a practice PCAT. While no book can completely prepare someone for every question on the PCAT, nearly all the topics that were covered on the exam were reflected on at some point in Barron's."
3,How to Prepare for the PCAT,"I agree with Chadd's review regarding time management. I took this test earlier today (10/25/2003) and found this book to be very useful for preparing in the Verbal, Biology and Chemistry sections. However, the Reading Comprehension was significantly more difficult than the passages/questions given in this book. Many questions on the actual exam were ""What did the author infer from ""...."" in the passage"". Also, on the actual exam, be very careful with your time management in the Quantitative section since there are 65 questions in about 30 minutes. I would suggest finding other sources to supplement this text for the Reading Comprehension section. The method that I suggest is to study for this exam by practicing taking as many tests as you can find. Good Luck."
1,give and take only some!!!,"TERRIBLE!! I bought this book based on previous reviews, thinking that it should be good in prepareing me for the PCAT. Overall, the verbal, chem, and bio sections were pretty good. Reading and Quantitative were TERRIBLE. The questions on the actual test were significantly harder than ones here. The Reading questions on the actual tests were more ""thinking"" questions than matters of finding answers word for word in the beginning of every paragraph (as this book misleads you to think). I would recommend you using your old SAT books or MCAT books to study for this Reading section. Or just read a lot of good magazines, ie. New Yorker, Times...etc."
4,Helped me a ton,"One complaint, the verbal section is different on the real test. The analogies are the same, but the instead of antonyms, the actual test uses fill in the blank sentence completion. The other sections are pretty good though. Combined with one offical PCAT practice test I scored in the 93rd percentile (got my scores today)."
3,I bought it and got a 99,"a pretty good book, i bet if i used it i would have done even better, but probably not, it kinda sat on the shelf, and it looked useful, just watch out for the chem section, lots of questions and little time. i'm sure if i'd used it i would have done better, or maybe not, but i gotta say that i did buy the book and i did get a 99%ile, for Jan 2003. take care"
2,Not that great,"This book didn't help me much. It has a 3 tests for you to keep trying, but it doesn't have any lessons like Kaplan book"
3,PCAT,"This book is great for familiarizing yourself with the format of the PCAT and the outlines for each section are helpful. There are plenty of practice questions, but I found several answers that were incorrect. Moreover, the biology section was quite a bit off. (It didn't mention anything about immunology, microbiology or ecology.) Both the math and reading comprehension sections were over-simplified in this guide as compared to the real test questions. The vocabulary and chemistry sections were the ""truest to form"" in terms of the real test!Overall, I would recommend this book as a way to prepare yourself for the format and the chemistry section of the test. If you are weak in math and biology, I would recommend finding alternative guides."
4,Good Way to Review,"I just took the October PCAT and I this was the only outside book I bought to study with. Between all the review questions and the 2 practice tests this was an excellent way for me to review concepts I had learned a couple years ago. The questions are pretty accurate with the real test, however the Reading section on the PCAT was more difficult. I would reccommend this book as a great study companion to all you old science books."
5,A great set-up for Mission: Impossible-2,This is a great book to read to set you up for watching the new Mission: Impossible sequel. The book gives context and a sense of film history in better understanding the life of John Woo and how he has developed his film directing career. I cannot think of another film director from outside of the United States that has achieved the kind of commercial success in terms of box office that Woo has accomplished.
1,Heard rewrote articles from the web,"I looked forward to this book, as I'm a huge fan of Woo's films. When I received my copy, and thumbed through it, I felt let down. Almost every quote Heard used (99% of them) were taken from articles I-- and diehard Woo fans-- have already seen on the web. Heard really didn't offer any new information whatsoever. He didn't even include any photos, and his ""coverage"" of Woo's life prior to 1986's A Better Tomorrow film is almost non-existent. Heard slapped together newspaper articles and called it a ""book."" A better book on John Woo needs to be written, by a credible source who actually spoke with the individuals they write about."
3,"good, but not definative","Think of this book as a really extensive magazine article. If you're looking for some behind-the-scenes information on the second half of John Woo's career, look no further. However, if you're a film student looking for a complete in-depth critique of John Woo as an artist and director from both a technical and biographical perspective, this book will leave you a little hungry."
2,John Woo Biography,"This book, though very informative, is taken from so many other already available sources that it reads more like some student's book report. The most inaccurate passage being that Jeff in ""The Killer"" wears white gloves like Jeff in ""Le Samourai"". I own ""The Killer"" and do not remember seeing him wearing gloves. Also, Christopher Heard claims that some scenes from ""The Killer"" match ""Le Samourai"" shot for shot. That is completely untrue. Obviously Mr. Heard has not done his homework and thoroughly researched his subject matter. All in all, it is an interesting read if you are unfamiliar from where some of the material is plagerized."
1,THIS CD IS MASTERED FROM A VINYL RECORD!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"This rating is not in regards to the album itself, but the quality of it. Do not buy this CD or anything from Ptg Records PERIOD!!! All of their released CDs are mastered from vinyl records and not from the original master tapes. They fade the songs out early to hide the rumbling sound from the vinyl. The sound is inferior compared to if the real master tapes were used. I was fooled into buying Atlantic Starr's ""Radiant"", thinking it was the real CD, but was gravely mistaken. Wait until whomever has the rights to the real masters to reissue this great album. Ptg records needs to shut their operation down completely and bring this deception to an end!!!"
3,nice and beary warm.,"This is not the actual sock we got as these were sized for children, My son in law likes bears and is living in cold weather so I thought these would be perfect. He got the wrong pair on his Birthday but sent his size in Brown Bear socks soon after at no charge. Thank you for making it right!"
2,Eh....,"This album isn't really that great. There are three versions of ""Death of a Party"", and the only one I really like is the Billy Whiskers version. All the rest drag on for far too long. The Moby remix of Beetlebum, John McIntyre's Theme From Retro, and the broadway On Your Own actually sound like different songs, and are well thought out. In the end, however, you're sitting around for an hour listening to some half-hearted remixes that drag on for far too long. The remixes of Bugman off of Coffee and TV were much better on the whole, all different styles and under six minutes apiece. On this album we get a 12 minute opus of all the many tracks in Essex Dogs played separately. Not too exciting, but interesting.The second disc is pretty great, Graham blisteringly leading them through some singles. Amazing, but only twenty minutes long. If only they cut out three of the remixes and added some more John Peel tracks!"
3,good album for true Blur lovers,"There are some good mixes of Blur songs on here (beetlebum). I would not recommend for light Blur fans, but it is essential for die hard blur fans."
3,nice treat,"an odd collection of various electronic interpretations of Blur songs plus some live cuts. the live songs are good and charged up but i don't find myself listening to them too much. the remixes offer alot more to chew on and there's some really good ones that require repeated listens. particularly the ""well blurred mix"" of Death of A Party. and if you like that song, there are 3 different remixes to check out on this cd. it's a good thing, because of all the songs represented on this first disc, ""Death..."" seems to be the one that really lends itself open for a remix. the other selections are sometimes off the mark, but always interesting. overall, not an essential album, but a nice treat for fans of later era Blur."
3,It was a dark and dreary night....,"I lost patience with the novel-style approach to the subject. ""Make yourself comfortable,I said, as I'm going to cover..."" and ""The first prinicple is one of Zed's favorites, I smiled"", etc. I quickly tired of trying to keep track of the various personalities, and the social nuances that occupy so much space in the book. Perhaps I'm too sensitive to time-wasting paragraphs. Looking at the previous reviews, I may need to read further into the book to find the heart of the course. But I'm really not much of a miner (or minor!).If you appreciate books that are half novel and half instruction, then you will probably enjoy this book. I didn't buy it to be entertained."
1,Insulting,"I have a high opinion of the Friends of Ed series. However, after suffering through 1.5 chapters of this ""screen play"", I will forevermore scrutinize any FOE book before purchasing. If you enjoy silly little shows like ""Saved by the Bell"" then this book is perfect for you. Cheesy jokes and dialog are the rule in this 500 page sleeper. I gave up in chapter 2 because, let's face it...I have better ways to spend my time than panning for gold like an old forty-niner, digging through the endless chatter of the ""characters"" for any golden nuggets of useful information.If you are beginner, I recommend buying a book on the theory of design alone and then buying a book on Flash"
1,Pathetic...,"The physical layout of this book is absolutely HORRIBLE. It is a perfect example of everything a technical book designer SHOULD NOT do: Pages and pages of unrelenting gray text; extra-narrow margins on all four sides so that even more text can be squeezed onto each page; no useful headers to distinguish one page from another; no visual anchors to allow readers to go back and locate something later.And then there's the author's writing style... the book reads like a script from one of those ""duck and cover"" films produced by the US government during the 1950s.I can't imagine how this foolish book made it past an acquisitions editor and a production team. My opinion of ""Friends of Ed"" dropped dramatically when I saw this thing."
4,Yes! I've learned to design,"This book is JAMMED with useful information for any designer. I bought it thinking I would learn Flash MX, and was thrilled with the tutorials. However, I learned much more about design and the design process. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a reference guide to learning to draw, understanding color schemes, and how and why grid utilization is important in design.The narrative style was a bit difficult in the beginning for me, but once I began reading, the book was difficult to put down. I kept wanting to know what would happen to the characters, as well as how they would handle all the design projects! You can't beat the vast information here for the price."
3,Delicate glasses,"These are nice margarita glasses, but the glass is rather thin. My wife was washing dishes and had one of the glasses in the sink of water, slipped out of her hand and the glass broke. I have several varieties of Luigi Bormioli wine glasses and none of them seem as fragile as these are. Other than being fragile, they have a nice shape and are better to drink margaritas out of than pint glasses. They are a good size for margaritas, not too big and not too small."
3,not the real deal!,"get ""the compact king crimson""used for the full versions of the songs,the abridged ones are good,but not as tripped-out!"
3,I'm partial to the newer stuff,"I attempted to wimp out and get all the good King Crimson songs on one CD, and I did, technically, I'm just partial to everything after Adrian Belew joined the band.I would have been better off buying ""Three of a Perfect Pair"" and ""Discipline"" separately.Still, I've learned to enjoy several of the older songs, just not quite as much."
3,Good Drama,If you like charachter development and classic good drama you will enjoy this series. Well done
3,OK but not great mystery with lots of predictability,DCI Tanner is a man who needs no help to crack the toughest cases. On his most recent murder he is assigned a new assistant who is looking to use this case to clear her sullied reputation. When Tanner's eyesight begins to fail he decides to brazen it out and conceal his disability. When detective Tully finds out the truth she offers to strike a deal with Tanner and serve as his eyes in exchange for his pushing her career along. The case allows them both to gain respect for each other and to learn that a sharp mind is more important than sharp eyes in police work.
2,"Second Sight 1, Clive Owen 5","There is something about this guy I cannot put my finger on. He is not as pretty as Ewan McGregor or Jude Law but definitely more versatile than both combined. From Croupier to I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, he looks different in each role. Some of his characters are more repulsive than attractive, but still he never lost my interest."
5,tripping out with cabaret voltaire,spark one up and groove to the intricate electronic beats by the pioneers of electronica. This cd rules!
1,what's the point?,"any sentient being who's heard the original remixes of these tracks would tell you that they were far superior to these so-called ""updated"" remixes. This cd just sort of sits there and repeats itself and is ultra tedious to listen to. frankly, a waste of time. pressure the label to release the original versions instead."
4,"Excellent, however a bit outdated","I bought this book because I wanted to learn how to invest. My parents, grandparents or anyone in my family for that matter have NEVER invested. Therefore I am starting at square one. I wanted to learn investing at a basic starter level. All I can say is this book was EXACTLY what I was looking for. Although it is a bit outdated (1995), it taught me all the basics I needed to know. It was a great book to gain knowledge on investing. Now I feel comfortable knowing all the different ways to invest. I just purchased ""One Up On Wall Street"" can't wait to gain more knowledge!"
4,A Great Primer,"This book serves to provide a groundwork for the future investor by explaining the basics of finance, stocks and companies. While geared toward a younger audience, anyone looking for a starting point to educate themselves about investing will find this book useful. Though somewhat dated now (references to ""great"" companies like GM & Chrysler, as well as a list of resources that have now been supplanted by online references) it still serves its purpose well. If you're looking to teach your children, or yourself, about the stock market and how to begin thinking about saving money; this is a great starting point."
4,A Good Start,This book provied great information on the hitory of the market. This book gives very basic information on investing and is great for young adluts who want to learn about investing. I would recomend this book to the age group of a High School or early college teens.
5,Learn to Earn,"I thought the book was excellent. I appreciated the historical perspective on the financial history of our country. Additionally, my brother who has gotten me interested in investing, and who is also a new investor, is making a lot of the mistakes mentioned in the book. I have tried to convince him to read this book but alas, he won't listen.My approach to any new venture is to get as much information as I can. I think this book is an excellent starting point."
4,Good for beginners like me,"This book is apparently written for students, but the only way you feel that is the author's occasional attempt to be hip to what brand names his younger readers would recognize.It is a solid introduction to how companies and the stock market works, with lots of interesting tidbits from history.I wish he had written more about Index Funds, because further studies have shown me that many experts regard these as the closest thing to a safe bet you can make in stocks. But of course a book consisting of the one sentence ""buy index funds"" might not sell well. :)"
2,simplistic,"The book's cover reads ""accessible to anyone who is high-school age or older."" Rather, this book should not be read by anyone who is high-school age or older. Its style is childish and it lacks a thorough treatment of investment principles. For example, they dodge any discussion of portfolio theory simply advocating 100% investment in stocks; ""diversification"" does not even appear in the index. The duo also neglects the failure of nearly all professional fund managers. Of course Lynch was a dramatic success but statistical analysis shows that skill is almost unseen among the pros. There are better sources for the basics. Look to William Bernstein, Ben Graham, Burton Malkiel, John Bogle, and their peers for a more rigorous investigation of investment strategy."
1,Of little value as an investment tutorial,"Of the book's 272 pages, only 20 pages in two appendices actually contain any useful information about stock picking and investment. The first approximately 200 pages are devoted to a variety of topics, none of which are of any particular relevance to someone who has already decided to begin investing in individual stocks. This book may be valuable to encourage your teenager to become involved in saving and investment, but if you're looking for investment instruction, this book will be of little (if any) help."
2,Good read for Junior High level kids,"The information in this book is way too basic and poorly organized. It could be a useful book for kids ages 12-16. Half the book is a summary of US history and the other half could be summarized on one page. Overall it was a poor investment of time and money. ""One Up On Wallstreet"" was in a whole different league."
4,Enjoyable but...,"I really enjoyed the historical review and even the partial diatribes on the importance of our business leaders and their importance to society. I read this book in one sitting and would buy it again but ""Learn to Earn"" seems misleading.I found little useful information for investing. I consider myself a novice at investing but this book offered nothing to really make me a better invester that I did not already know. One reviewer said that the useful investing information could be summed up in 3 or 4 pages. I agree if you want to reduce this book to a text book of investing but don't discard the other information presented. I found it very interesting at the least but more likely useful historical perspective that can affect the way I invest.If you want a more pure book on investing there are books like The Warren Buffet Way and even more text-book-like ones out there. This is a good soft core book of investing that is an enjoyable read. I recommend it."
4,A good book for teen and older investors,I am 13. I got this book when I was 12. this is a good book for teenagers starting to invest and older people. It shows the importance of investing.
1,Don't buy the book - use the money to invest instead,"Unless you are in 5th grade, or don't know the first thing about investing, this book will be totally useless. Much better beginner information can be found for free online, or in such books as Tobias's ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need."" The useful information in this book could have been cut down to about 5 pages. Instead, Rothchild fills the book up with meaningless, albeit somewhat interesting, tidbits of economic trivia. It seems as though Lynch's only contribution to this book is his name and face on the cover. The man is a genius at investing, and an even better conman for getting me to waste $14, which I could have more wisely put in the market."
4,Step One,"Good beginning book if you have never taken a business class in school or are brand new to investingMr Lynch's advice:Start nowHave a planDo your homeworkHang in there for the long term (a 20 year timeline)I suppose you could apply it to almost anything in life: losing weight, studying a foreign language, or starting a business etc.This advice seems a little vanilla to me, however if you are just starting out this may be all you need.Buy this book if you are in stage one of your investment path."
4,As the title says- A beginner's guide,"This is a beginner's guide for investor, but there are many valuable lessons to be learned from this book. For one, I realised the magic of compounded returns and the importance of living frugally.A history lesson on the financial market is interesting as well, and Lynch certainly advocate invest for the long term. He also question the validity of worrying about the GDP number, trade number, etc. when one should be worrying about buying the right company's share.I would recommend readers to buy ""one up on wall street"" after this book."
5,just right,"attractive enough for nice events, lightweight, closure is reliable, holds what is needed for a few hours: lipstick, kleenex, key, credit cards and license, cell phone, etc."
2,"Too cramped, and felt cheap","I suppose I wanted this to be leather. Since it wasn't, the tight feel of the card slots led me to believe that they would tear easily once I started adding and removing cards on a regular basis. It also has a lot less space on the interior for my phone and other small items than I had thought it might. It was rather cramped, making it uncomfortable to get things in and out. Overall, it's just not a pleasant experience using this bag and so I sent it back."
5,I love this,I've always wanted a wallet like this and never could find one till now. I love my new wallet.I'm happy
2,Poor quality :),"The ""leather"" string looked so cheap that I ended up unhooking it and throwing it away. There is a small loop handle that I use to hold the purse, but I usually can't get the handle to slide back into the clutch. The leather on the front has become scratched with about a dozen tiny scratches. I don't know if the scratches are due to poor quality leather, or not.Otherwise, the purse is useful because it fits my iPhone."
3,Disappointed in design change,"Having used this single flap Buxton wallet for years and enjoying its ease of use, perfect for travel, I was excited to be able to reorder same on internet. Then to my disappointment I find Buxton redesigned and it now lacks features so much needed for organizing. The coin purse on inside front was removed for more creditcard slots. The middle zipper compartment which I used to put extra credit cards, car key,now placed on inside front which is hard to open, not suitable for change and lacks room for anything but small note. Inside pocket is no longer divided for money & receipts. My old Buxton is shabby, but I'll continue to use it."
3,Buxton Check Clutch Mini Bag on a string,"I purchased this mini bag for the convenience of not having to carry a purse all the time when I only need to have my cards, drivers license, cellphone etc. It is so convenient especially during the summer when I don't have to be wearing a coat. However, I am very disappinted with the product as the red is not starting to come off around the outside of the bag. I do not think it is worth the money I spent."
3,"Satisfactory, but I really want an external cell phone compartment","Pro:1. Overall smapp size2. Good card slot arrangement. Cards easily visible & no risk of them accidentally falling out.3. Removable shoulder strap4. Integrated wrist strap5. Dedicated ID slot6. Nice to have an open internal compartmentCon:1. No external, easy access cell phone compartment2. Internal & external zippered pockets do not easily accomodate even the smallest non-flat items."
2,Not so happy,I grew up listening to the studio album. Not so happy with this remastered CD. The preview tracks are the studio version.
2,Nesting material,First time I have ever had a problem with a product like this lost 3 baby finches who were wrapped tightly in string.
5,Too good just to rent!,"I hardly ever want to see a movie enough times to buy it. But this is an exception. The story, the characters, the portrayals, the cinematography all combine to make a wonderful production. You will fall in love with these English country people, and you see the characters' nobility as well as their flaws. Don't even bother to see the 1967 version. I saw it and hated it, and probably wouldn't have seen this one except I caught it a few minutes in and didn't see the title at first. It's so far above the 1967 one it's almost like 2 different stories! In the 1967 one, you can't see why Bathsheba would have anything to to with any of her suitors, much less become so obsessed with Troy. But in this one, you can see merits in them all. There are some scenes that would be disturbing for children, but for teens and adults, it's a beautiful, beautiful movie. How about a DVD version?"
4,Worth a viewing!,"I own both the 1960's version and now the 1998 version on dvd..........both are very good but I still prefer the Julie Christie version in terms of cinematography, soundtrack and picture quality. They both have their pluses.......if you read the book, watch both, and make your own decision! If I had to buy one however, its hard not to like the Julie Christie version--an underrated masterpiece!"
3,An excellent adaptation but only fair DVD transfer.,"I can't really add anything to what others have said as to this particular adaptation as it is a stunning work.I give it 5 stars, but I give the DVD 3 stars. It is not a good transfer. At times slightly fuzzy and grainy, but still much better than my old VHS copy. If you have the VHS version, I would still recommend buying the DVD version even with its faults.Maybe someday they'll restore it. After all, I never expected to see a DVD 14 years after the show was released."
4,1998 UK TV Version,"Not a review - just a note: this is the UK TV version from 1998. For reviews of the program, look here:[...]"
4,Rating of Far from the Madding Crowd,"The acting, attire and period atmosphere was excellent. The pace of the first half of the movie was on the slow side. However, the storyline came together in the second half."
5,"Scrumptious, delightful, faithful!",A very faithful rendition of Thomas Hardy's book. The cast is terrific and are very believable in the roles. Nathaniel Parker as the loyal and decent Gabriel Oak and Paloma Baeza as the headstrong and impetuous Bathsheba bring simmering fire to their parts. This version quickly became my favorite adaptation.
5,Made me cry,"I was feeling weary and teary eyed at the end, which was a huge shock for all because I was usually the one who walked out of Disney films with dry eyes. Moving and compelling."
4,If only I had 10 minutes a day...,"This book was a good starting point to learn Norwegian. The biggest complaint is that without an audio tape, I wasn't quite sure about some of the emphases in saying sentences. I also didn't have a dedicated 10 minutes a day for the several weeks I had the book before going to Norway. Then, of course, everyone in Norway speaks English, so learning Norwegian wasn't that important after all. The stick-on labels should have the English on the back, because otherwise it was hard to remember what the words referred to long enough to go seek them out in the house.I think if you really apply yourself, it is a good system to learn by."
4,Valuable,"I purchased this book as a part of a class I was taking. It was easy to follow. Simple, direct, and nice illustrations. There were some topics for traveling which weren't covered, but most needed topics were included."
4,Norwegian language learning,"Extremely useful for learning Norwegian. from an English speakers point of view, (phonetic spellings and pronunciations), flash cards, Pocket guides, CD Rom. Good system, you can't beat."
1,Stickers were the only useful part.,"This book tries to get the learner to translate sentences into Norwegian by substituting isolated words and phrases. What the learner does, instead, is translates the Norwegian word or phrase into English and goes on reading the sentence! The sticker labels were the only useful part of this book, in my opinion. I have been studying and teaching Norwegian for years, and could suggest other books that are more helpful than this one."
5,Great Book,I bought this book for my boyfriend who had recently been to Norway and fell in love with the language and wanted to learn. He has told me only wonderful things about it and uses it every day. He says it is easy to follow and provides for great practice. He has even been able to hold a conversation with his Norweigan friend quite well since using it. I would highly recommend this book.
2,it just turk,"turk boy keep ur head up on the real....mane a nigga cant wait til u get out so u can come with some real hard music....cause mane this aint u, dont get me wrong its ok it not the as good as young and thuggin...but to the real turk fans dont buy this get it from a friend if some one bought it. AND ONE MORE THING ITS IMPORTANT TO MEMPHIS FOLKS AND MEMPHIS RAP FANS THIS FOOL IS NOT FROM MEMPHIS AND KINFOLK NEED TO KEEP MY CITY OUT HIS MOUTH..nigga went u get out the n.o. got ur back so dont be flippin citys on ur fans"
1,Fatty Fatty 4x4 cant go through the kitchen door.,"What is Crazy Fat Ethel II? Well its the sequel to the 1975 Shlock horror film Criminally Insane, its a bad sequel at that. there is not even 30 minutes of new material, most of the movie including the credits (yes, the credits) are ripped from Criminally Insane which in turn look ripped from another movie due to the fuzzy boarder around the text....oh the days before photoshop. While Criminally insane was shot on 8mm film, this one is shot right on VHS, like movies considered to be this ones sequels, Death Nurse 1 and 2...both of which are mostly made up of stock footage of Criminally Insane and shot on VHS as well. The parts of Crazy Fat Ethel II which are new footage is juvenile (running in circles around a coffee table stuff), and not worth your time."
3,"3 stars for oddity, not quality","A friend of mine had it on tape in high school; I'm not sure how she came across it. It's not good. However, it IS a great movie to watch with your friends and raise boggled eyebrows as to the sheer idiotic logic, bad acting, and silly moments of schlock horror. My memory is stretching here, but a few highlights: a game of ""Truth or Dare"" played by the side of the road which includes the quotation ""I dare you...to take your eye out...with THIS!"" (at which point the character pulls out a corkscrew like thingy and the other character indeed pulls her eye out with it...a prison mental ward where the inmates get to have a METALSHOP!!!...a car peeling out over the body of an infant...Twisted stuff...So enjoyably bad I can't believe it's not Troma. We never have tracked down Crazy Fat Ethel part I...but if I remember correctly this version recaps it at the beginning..."
4,No One to Play With?,"Parents of children who are ADHD/LD will appreciate the real-life stories of other parents and children who have difficulties navigating Social side of life. Many practical strategies/suggestions are offered here.Reading the anecdotes is probably as close as you can get to 'walking in your child's shoes' and understanding their personal experience of living with a learning disability.If you enjoy ""politically correct"" words and phrases, be aware that the word handicap/handicaps/handicapped is used somewhat frequently in this book, however, this factor alone should not deter a reader from gleaning the valuable information and strategies offered."
4,Great book! Every parent or grandparent should read this book.,I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child period. Not just a child with LD or ADHD. This book is enlightening to everyone on understanding a childs behaviors and parenting and disciplinary tips. I purchased this book when the words learning disability was brought up for my own child and really learned a lot as far as what is considered a LD these days by many and what needs to be done to open the eyes of many more. Great book!! Just read it and see.
3,"Decent, not fresh","Driven by a love for Ethiopia Sidamo coffee beans and a penny pincher attitude instilled by my grandmother, I went searching through Amazon for a cheap alternatives to my local cafe's beans. I can tell you this quest was not successful. I've tried several whole bean coffees from Amazon and every one of them tastes old and stale. If I lived in a location with a poor coffee bean selection I'd still be ordering online, but if you live in Seattle or any other town with fresh beans I'd recommend buying locally."
2,Not what I expected,"I was so excited to see a documentary on the evils of Jesse Helms, but what I got was a self-serving 8 1/2 wanna-be. I just don't understand how such a young filmmaker could have the audacity to do a first film about such a huge public figure and then spend the majority of the footage pointing the camera to himself. I am of the school that says ""If the movie shows how hard is is to be Gay in the country it's OK with me"" but I still cannot reccomend this one-unless you are fascinated by Tim Kirkman (Who? Exactly.)"
4,Far better than expected expoloitation trash,"This is pretty much a remake of ""House of Wax"" but updated with CGI effects and liberal doses of nudity and gore. Suprisingly well done, stylish, lowbrow, sleazy and lots of fun. It maintains an engrossingly weird and dream-like atmosphere--from the lovely opening shot of fireworks bursting over the Eiffel Tower to the bizarre Terminator-eque finale in, of course, a burning wax museum. Costumes, cinematography, art direction and music are first rate and some amusing plot twists occur (courtesy of Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento). Highly recommended to fans of Hammer films and European horror.The DVD is non-anamorphic widescreen. Clean print. Nice, solid transfer. No extras aside from a small effects photo gallery but don't let that deter you."
3,Okay textbook for beginners,"This book was my first ever introduction to computer programming. I took this in my junior year of high school, and found it a well-written textbook that was understandable by me and everyone else in my class. Like other textbooks in computer programming, there is only so much the authors can do to differentiate it from other texts, so I do not find it much better, or much worse, than subsequent books I have encountered in programming."
1,Completely useless,"This review is for the kindle version of Black's law dictionary (Kindle Fire) and not Black's law dictionary itself. The kindle version is impossible to use. The text is completely jumbled with no spaces in between definitions, making them all run together. In addition there is no way to search other than the text search on the kindle, making it very difficult and time consuming to find the definition that you are looking for."
1,Very Disappointed!,"Don't buy this book unless you're prepared to buy her other books as well! In this book the author gives you part of the answer and then refers you to her other books for the rest of the answer!Guess she thinks this is going to help her sell all her books!If they were cheap and GOOD that might be okay but I wouldnt buy anything that promises the answers and then have to keep buying other books to get the full answer!Sorry but I was very disappointed! She should call herself a salesperson and not a Doctor!Good luck on finding the right book,but in my opinion this is not it.I am beggining to believe most of these reviews are written by people who are in some way affiliated with the Author or the company selling the books!"
3,I'm sure it's a fine book,"I really can't review this book! I've never laid eyes on it. I bought it as a gift for someone, and they have received it. However, I haven't heard what that person's response is, other than having significant interest in reading it.Sorry I can't do more."
1,This guy wanna make a quick buck with a book of this kind...,"This is a well writen book clearly because the author did hired a good editor. But how will this guy really know the FMLN strategies when he hasn't been part of FMLN. The beutiful words used in this book and the so called documetation and interviews are not reason enough to become an expert in the matter. He just want to make some money out of this. Stay away from this book, many inocent people was murdered for this guys (and I'm talking about the salvadorean army)."
1,book: BE THE CHANGE,"Ordered this book from Amazon. Received a book called The Four Mistakes. Called them, left message, no answer, E-mailed Amazon and got an email from hugobooks that they would send me the correct copy and to keep the book that I received. Have not gotten the book I ordered. I have previously received good service from Amazon. Can you help me?The arthritis disc was good.Thanks,Lara Petisslpetiss@yahoo.com"
2,Shopping for a different brand,I bought the 250g version and it died within a month. Seagate replaced it. I have had that one for 2 years now and much of my data has disappeared. I am looking for a bigger drive to backup new data and replace the Seagate.
1,HORRIBLE SUPPORT,"Seagate's support is little to none. In fact it's some of the worse support I've ever experienced. If you purchase any products from them make sure you get an extra plan for full replacement and if your data is mission critical go with another brand. Dont go through what I did.There are also issues with this product and Vista. There is a sleep function that cannot be controlled. When you go to save you have to wait 60 to 90 seconds for the hard drive to wake up from sleep mode. If you do a lot of saving or access the drive a lot, it's not a reasonable solution."
3,A Good Starting Point...,"This is a good album to buy to see if you like this Latin music that you may have heard about.There are a coupla ""cute"" novelty numbers that distracted and detracted from the album as a whole for me. On the other hand, the Latin numbers are dead-on, rock-solid examples of the genre: if you don't like them, you won't like Latin."
4,funkalicious dance grooves,"I trully enjoyed this cd by miss johnston,never had so much emotions moved me to the dance floor. She is rival to the other so called divas. Sabrina is tops in her class. We partied with this cd all nite. She is inspiring to all. She definitely has a ""reason"" to sing, to the the masses!"
4,Good purchase.,Looks great on the table but also stores easily.One minor complaint is that there should be more small marker blocks for the more difficult puzzles.
3,Okay substitute,I ordered this Sudoku board because my dog had eaten the wooden tiles from my original board. I do not like that I cannot stack the numbers on the board to see how many of what number are left. Otherwise it is an okay substitute for the original board from Smart Minds.
3,Disappointed,"Wood Expressions Wooden SudokuI am very disappointed in the quality and design of the product. The tile storage drawers fall open when the game is moved, and because of the design of the storage space, the tiles can jam inside the drawer, making it difficult to get all of the tiles out.I had seen the plastic set by BriarpatchSudoku Gameat a friend's, and wanted one for myself. I ordered the Wood Expressions set (almost twice the cost) because the Briarpatch set was not available in local stores or through Amazon.In my opinion the Briarpatch set is a much better product, and certainly a better value."
5,Sudoku Board,"At first I was disappointed as the board had a very noticeable dent in the side. I emailed the distributor and did not hear back for a while. She emailed me back after I had already purchased another board, and I told her my disappointment, but to my delight, she sent me another (perfect) board as an ""I'm sorry"" and told me to just keep the damaged board (which I am now going to give to my hubby!) I would definitely deal with this fine company again as they certainly made it right! Thank you, Christine!"
5,Sudoku fun,"I purchased this for my father who is 84 years old. He loves to do Sudoku puzzles from the newspapers. This is a nice size-easier for him to work with, and very neat-which my Mom appreciates. He loves it. Toys are not just for children."
5,Physic T,The Wood Expressions Wooden Sudoku game is well made. It was well protected for shipping. I would highly recommend this company and this product to anyone interested in sudoku.
3,Wooden working pieces,"The product is as described, but I was disappointed and frustrated by the lack of wooden thinking pieces. I purchased this product for my wife who found the lack of thinking pieces frustrating. The hidden drawer for the pieces certainly has more than enough room to house more. I noticed before my purchase that another customer responded about the lack of thinking pieces. I discounted this criticism. I wish I hadn't. What to do? Back to paper and pencil."
1,Very Disappointed,"I am very disappointed because I ordered this toy as a present and it came to the person without all of the playing pieces, which is embarrassing. Now accidents do happen but I emailed the company with this mistake. I am still waiting for a response and it has been over 3 weeks. My mother can not use this game because it is missing all of the # 6 tiles. Now you may say that she mixed the 9's and 6's up. However, she only has 10 # 9 tiles so it is the companies mix up. I wish they would rectify this situation soon. I will be returning the present as soon as I can."
3,"DGQ- Great , But....","As someone who has followed Grisman's career since the early 1980's, I totally appreciate the music. The band was nothing short of revolutionary and the musicianship was/is still off the scale in every incarnation that the band has had in the last 27 years that I've been following them. That being said, there was just something about the sound quality that left me wanting with this DVD. It sounded either that it was a bad sound mix or almost that they used an omni-directional microphone in the audiance for the sound track. I yearned to hear the individual instruments clearer but it just wasn't to be. I've heard the band live more than a couple of times and this came short of that experience. Still..... much better than never experiencing them at all."
2,Boring animal book,"I found this book a little boring - in fact I could not bring myself to finish it completely. Yes, it's animal stories but nothing like I have read before. Very disappointing."
2,I never could get into this book,It left the carousel after the 2nd story. I dont know if it was just my mood or what but I just couldnt get into it.
5,a true classic,"there are precious few bodies of work in the music industry that have and will stand the test of time, but listening to this again after nearly 18 years confirms its greatness. the power of the lyrics, the haunting melodies, and the charm of his stories make it timeless. ""slow song"" happens to be my favorite - the cadence itself grabs you and pulls you in, just as surely as any tornado might."
4,Early crossroads,"This concept album is probably Jackson's finest work, with its jazzy layerings and hit songs. ""A Slow Song"" may be a bit long, but for the most part it's fun to hear what happens next."
3,When we didn't run from the radio,"3 1/2Enjoyable treat of early 80's, finely crafted pop mainly survives intact to this day, despite some young synthetic explorations and generic culture rips, because of how well tuned everything is. Certainly the album cannot rise to the measure of its greatest parts, also overplaying a few hands in what sounds like critical courting, but N&D; remains consistently and intelligently fun throughout and in its best moments demonstrates the lesser portrayed and infinitely more satisfying elements in radio-writing, which has become undone in the last decades."
5,good stuff,"Steppin' Out was one of the highlights of music in 1982. The title track, as well as BREAKING US IN TWO, and CHINATOWN are true hits. Joe's piano playing is the impetus that vaulted this album to success. The title track moves and grooves but isn't over the top. The album overall has a jazzy feel to it, and is one of several albums from that era that were piano-driven. MTV was a powerful medium in those days, and certainly helped sell albums. But there are certain albums that will stand the test of time, and this is one of them. 9/10"
3,"An Idealized, Urbane Playground!","This album may represent the perfect NYC public relations ad - the idea of all of its citizens as urbane, upbeat, upscale sophisticates, with just the right amont of cynical wit to pass on to tourists!Coming right after Jumpin' Jive, it seems clear that Joe Jackson wanted to wed the mature, distanced lyrics of Porter or Gershwin to a type ofSalsa that was ""in"" among Mahattenites at the time. This marriage only completely works on ""Steppin' Out"" but ""Real Men"" and ""A Slow Song"" show a disarmingly accurate view of the anxiety and loneliness that often lurk beneath urban sophistication. Well worth repeated listenings!"
4,A certain desert island disk (or disc),"Look Sharp, Jackson's lyrics are infectious. Even after first listen, they will return to you in many forms. This is a great introduction to a very tallented songwriter, musician, and performer."
2,Too Much Night,"Given Jackson's reputation as a great songwriter and musician, and my strong liking of ""Real Men"" (despite its preachy overbearing lyrics), I decided to try Night & Day. I was very disappointed. The music is experimental, but not cohesive. Besides ""Real Men"", the only songs with a hint of soul are ""Breaking Us In Two"" and ""A Slow Song"". Go pull out an Elvis Costello record instead."
5,Must Own Album,"While Look Sharp was one of the best debut albums, Night and Day, a few years later, reveals a more refined Jackson sound. The album has a couple weaker tunes, but the best tunes are as good as anything in the entire decade, and that's not hyperbole. I'll compare ""Slow Song"" to any song in the 80's. The vocals alone are astounding. Add to that what was a unique top 40 sound in ""Stepping Out"" and the terrific ""Another World"", ""Real Men"" and ""Breaking Us In Two"", and you have the makings of a truly great album. Even the album cover is cool."
4,A Bold New Step For One of Punk's Angry Young Men,"This 1982 album took one of punk's ""angry young men"" in a new direction, gave him his biggest hit single, and all without charges of ""selling out.""Here Joe Jackson pays tribute to New York City while channeling Cole Porter and the results are marvelous. From the classy pop sheen of ""Steppin' Out"" (his only top ten single in the US where it reached #6 near the end of 1982, to the pensive heartbreak of ""Breaking Us In Two"" (which reached #18 in the winter of 1983) to the Latin jazz bop of ""Target,"" to ruminations on changing perceptions on masculinity in the haunting ""Real Men"" the album showcased sharp, smart song writing, and top notch band, all of which has help up nearly a quarter of a century later. Certainly a change of pace from the new wave/punk spirit of his earlier outings, but ""Night and Day"" finds Jackson making the transition in spades."
3,Disappointed!,"I agree with the other review (Mr. Pense). When this deluxe edition was first announced, it was supposed to include the three Spanish songs (""Un Otro Mundo,"" ""El Blanco""-ie, Target, and ""El Cancer"") that appeared on the Real Men EP. Instead we get five live songs most of us Joe fans already have! I blame Universal; if you look at Joe's official website, it's clear he has little control over the reissues."
3,I get a second disc? Why?,"Dream come true! A remaster of Night and Day. I have been waiting for this remaster so I can head to my desert island. Disc 1 sounds great, and is as close to perfect as a pop album can be. But disc 2? Why? The best track, Zemio, was cut from the Mike's Murder soundtrack. And if you're going to re-issue part of that pretty shoddy live album, at least make it the last side which ends with a gorgeous reinterpretation of 'Steppin' Out'. Five Stars for Disc 1. Three stars for the whole thing."
5,The break out hit for Joe Jackson,"Not much to say about this album that hasn't already been said. It is GREAT. It was Joe Jackson's break out hit and this album is where he made his name in the USA. Not a bad track on the whole thing and he lays them out so they take you on a journey, unlike the CDs of today which are simply a bunch of disconnected songs, or worse, iTunes-like downloads where you only get the ""hit"" and none of the other parts of the work. This is an old album that is a healthy mix of rock ballad and piano bar singer. I keep saying album, it just shows my age, but this CD is a good copy of that album and the sound is rich and full. A great CD from a true talent."
5,This is the ultimate brick set!,Cuts nicely with a sharp edge. The handle is comfortable and the harder plastic flange is there to deflect errant hammer blows. Even the yellow is a good idea when you go back outside after dinner and try to find your tools in the dark.
4,Works well,"This works well as planned. Bit surprised that it does a pretty neat job of cutting bricks. If you have a lot of bricks to cut in half say, this buy is worth the while since it will save you a considerable amount of cutting."
2,works great....so far,Two stars because I bought this to replace an identical unit three years ago.I bought this VDO fan assembly to replace the first VDO unit that burned out three years ago which I bought to replace the original unit in my 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 truck. Maybe this one will last more than three years.BTW this CAN be installed without completely removing the AC condenser by cutting out a small tab of plastic on the fan housing where the condenser pipe passes through the housing. Once the tab is cut out the condenser will lift up and out just enough to get the fan housing to slip up and out. Just be careful and don't force any of the lines.
3,Mediocre,"The unit came with the antenna broken so I am sending it back to Amazon.The sound from the ipod, a CD and radio are of poor quality, The radio sounds the best. The sound fidelity is not good despite tweaking with the controls."
2,Not Worth It,"This product dissapointed me in just about every way. Shortly after buying it I returned it to the store to invest in something better. I had read some of the other reviews by customers claiming that it it had a ""slight hum"" and it wasn't close to slight. It almost buzzed, the sound quality was horrible no matter what function it was on. The radio also got poor recption. In addtion the remote didn't allow menu changes and only worked short distances. The speaker is also pretty large for it's bad quality. It does run off batteries. Even with all it's features and the low price, invest in something with better quality."
2,Reception is awful,"I did not purchase this from Amazon, but felt I needed to put my review out here since this is where I look at reviews for products. I purchased this item to use at work so I could listen to my IPod and/or radio. The CD player was just an added bonus. However once I plugged it up, it took me forever to get a radio station in clear. And since it is digital there is no way to tweak the radio station in like you can with a turn dial. There is also a constant faint static noise. Again, it is constant! Whether you're playing the radio or IPod, you could hear this noise in the background. Now if I turned the volume up the music would over power it. However, since I'm using this in my office, I don't want the volume that loud. I have since returned this product and am looking for a better one."
1,2nd Generation iPod Nano does not fit,"2nd generation iPod Nano does not fit with the adapter they give you. Maybe they will start including a new adapter in the future. There was also a constant static sound. It was unacceptable to me, but my wife didn't care because you can't hear it if you turn the music up loud enough."
3,Volume problems,"We tried two brand-new units and in both cases, when one turns on the unit, the volume level starts at 17, which is over halfway up the scale. My wife works in an office where that level of punch in totally unacceptable, so an otherwise perfect product is useless to her."
2,Do not purchase this system,I am cheerleading coach and I really wanted a system that could play CDs and my i-pod (plus provide good sound within a gym for practice). I have been anything but happy with this system. It skips every time you play the CD. The sound is not very loud. The buttons are difficult to use and do not always respond when touched. Overall I would not rate this system highly.
3,Lasted Four years,"I got this item as a high school graduation gift in 2008, and fell in love instantly with the look of it, and even more so with the quality and sound. Recently the ipod docking station stopped working, which is sad because I used this boom box the most for my ipod. I did get four years out of it though."
2,Undesired fuzz,There is alot of fuzz and noise and the over all sound quality is not great. I would have been better off getting the cheaper one that sounds better without the CD player than to get this ilive piece.
4,Romp around selection,"this is a pretty funky selection - sleek scratches, jump-up rhythms, old-skool bass. being extremely catchy, it is ideal for parties, b-boy sessions or daft subwoofer drive-by exbibits ;)if you don't expect a demanding idm or deep soulful lyrics, you can't be disappointed.you'll be surprised at the number of familiar motifs or beats (both poached from and borrowed by other songs)"
5,shake your bon bon,great cd to shake to and to drive to. This man is so cute and has such a great sound. It's hard not to like him. Que percioso!
5,biografia musical,"muy buen disco. si eres fan de ricky martin tienes que comprar el cd ""aprendiendo a querer"" de jessica cristina, donde ricky grabo con jessica el tema ""todo es vida"". este tema es el primer duo de ricky en su carrera musical y fue grabado en 1992."
5,The Best of the Best,"What a wonderful way to hear the very best of six of Ricky's albums. If you are a fan of the newer music what a pleasant surprise to hear some of the earlier music that made him famous before we ""discovered"" him in the USA. Guaranteed to make you want to learn Spanish! The music shows that language is no barrier for pure enjoyment. Even if you have other Ricky Martin albums, the selections on this one gather the best of Ricky so far!"
5,"Unbelievable, music lovers of every type, BUY!","Love horns, love piano, love electric and/or acoustic guitar, violens, drums, a voice that will hit parts of you that you weren't aware were there . . . ? This album has it ALL. 99.9% Spanish lyrics, but your mother tongue could be of a distant minority, this album crosses ALL bariers. Ricky Martin most definitely proves himself a Musical, Spiritual Master, in touch with his soul, the soul of all us mere mortals! Open your big heart, your mind, let the music in and let ""La Historia"" change your life now and, no exaggeration, for all time . . ."
5,My truck fanatic's favorite!,"My three year old son loves this book! He loves the pictures (not too scary at all) and the funny, silly poems. I like the fact that the drawings show women and people of color driving and enjoying trucks, in addition to white men."
1,I didn't want my children seeing the pictures - too mean.,"My son loves trucks, cranes and other machinery so I couldn't wait for him to get this book. When I received my book order I opened the pages and flipped through and immediately I knew I would send this book back. The pictures were too mean and scary. I barely read the words and I did not like what I did read. I would never have bought this book if I had seen the pictures first."
2,Srinivas fans beware: not TRUE KARNATAK music,"After discovering the wonderful mandolin playing of U. Srinivas, I must say that this album came as quite a disappointment. After listening to albums like ""Magic Mandolin"" w/Zakir Hussein, ""Rama Sreerama,"" ""Modern Mandolin Maestro,"" and his 4-Disc live set ""Classical Encounters"" (not available from Amazon.com) this album came as a bitter let down. If you're into ambient, spacy, computer filled, production-heavy rambling, then I suppose this is the thing for you, but if you want TRUE karnatak music, this is NOT even close. Granted, I didn't expect pure karnatak music when I picked this disc up, but it is still weak. Michael Brook has the ability to find great artists, but he needs to stop collaborating with them. Pick up one of the above listed albums to hear the amazing mandolin wonder of India! In all fairness though, I do have to say that there is one good track on this album. that's what made it two stars instead of just one."
5,Good Translation!,I have read the Japanese version of this book. The translator did a very good job at describing the characters without making the book read like someone's thesis with multiple footnotes.
2,"Book is 5 stars, but this translation is TERRIBLE","This book in the Turney translation is fantastic, but this translation dates from the Twenties or so. It is easily the worst 20th C translation I've ever read; the English will leave you scratching your head at least once on every page. The publisher should be ashamed of continuing to reprint this mockery. Buy the Kodansha edition! (Yes, even though the Japanese translator said he had a native English speaker look over his work, the native English speaker probably had too much tact and not enough time to clean up the translator's butchery of English. But, having lived in Japan for 4 years, I can say that I've witnessed similar displays of hubris on the part of a very few Japanese.)"
1,Not good. See it....If you dare.,This movie was stupid the story sucked and it was to slow paced for me. The acting is by far terrible no actor (if they call themselves that) here gave an effort to at least try. The action could have been good but Jason Yee held back alot in his fight sequence. If you've seen Ong-Bak and Tom youm goon you will not enjoy this film. Those film took action to a new level this movie took 20 steps backwards. And the sword fighting is stupid because I guess they decided to use real swords so they moved really slow when they came at each other. Please if you have any taste in movies what so ever do not I say again do not see this movie.
3,Bruce Lee look-alike with Robert Rodriguez's hutzpah!,"I have a great deal of respect for Jason Yee--not only for his hard storied martial arts career, but also for him having the guts to make his dream into a reality. All too many times, we hear of the 'next big thing/martial arts star/action hero' but how often does a guy do it the hard way--literally making his/her own film!! Jason made this film for 80,000 dollars--and it looks pretty darn good! Good fight scenes, decent acting, and an appearance by Cung Le and Tony Todd('The Candy Man'). Great martial arts film on a budget."
4,"For 80k, it was great.","I just finished watching Dark Assassin and I was horribly dissapointed. I was expecting a bit more, the cover is so cool I really thought it would be more action less plot.I'll be honest, I am not happy with the majority of the fight scenes, and I didn't like the plot at all. But what won me over was the speical features and learning how they made the movie and the effort they put in. Jason Yee seemed like a really cool guy and very talented. With more production time and cheorgraphy, it could of been amazing. I give it 4/5, I would like to give it 5/5 based on work effort and budget alone, but I think 4/5 will reflect my full opinion more.Warning. If you find nothing respectible about other peoples hard work and effort to make a movie, and simply want to be entertained, I do not think this movie is for you. As mentioned, until I saw the special features, I was not a happy panda."
3,Mmmm...,"This doesn't really should be called a reencarnation of This Mortal Coil. It shares a similar sound, but lacks the variety of the former collective (since this is not a collective anymore). The vocals are handled by Louise Rutkowski, who sounds an awful lot like Siouxie Sioux. Dagger and Let The Happiness In are standouts. But their version of Is Jesus Your Pal? is vastly inferior to the Gus Gus original, which is a dark ambient masterpiece. By no means I would consider Smile's OK a bad album; it is just not what I expected it to be."
1,UK Buffoons,"This is the most idiotic movie I have seen since I made the mistake of viewingThe Hustle. It is very hurtful to see people of African descent in 2012 actings like bufoons. This movie is a poor imitation ofFriday (New Line Platinum Series). Even the music used whenever the local bully appeared is the same as in ""Friday."" The UK television and film industry doesn't give work to actors of African descent in serious dramas (notice the lack of main character roles for men of African descent in their popular television shows except Idris Elba inLuther), so they are forced to takes roles where the acts like deranged clowns."
3,"Judith Miller, Jayson Blair, Daniel Okrent","...the NYT All-Stars. worth a look, at least as unintended companion volume to Walter Lord's A Night to Remember. in the author's defense, he doesn't feign objectivity, whether it be in regard to the social views of NYT staffers or in defending theologies with ""trick power supplies."" on the downside, he's no Jack Germond."
4,Black Humor that Works,"The challenge of ""Seduced and Abandoned"" is met at the very beginning. Everything happens because the leading young lady is is seduced by her sister's fiancee. Since she is not yet 16, this really should not be funny but, if you accept what has happened then you will be able to enjoy what happens throughout the rest of the movie. ""Seduced and Abandoned"" is many things; a comedy of errors, a satire on Sicilian society, the double-standard between the sexes, and more. This really IS a funny movie and it excels in humor because of the sterotyped characters that range from the bombastic father to the timid brother and everything in between. The ending IS a bit odd but I guess that's in keeping with the beginning. I enjoyed watching ""Seduced and Abandoned""."
4,Dark Comedy Italian Style,"A delightfully satirical film! Germi explores an antiquated law that eradicates rape if the parties marry. Peppino doesn't want to marry Agnese because she is no longer virginal: ""The man has the right to ask; the woman has a duty to refuse."" But, why would Agnese want to marry her seducer? Chaos ensues in defense of family and honor."
3,"Fine, but not as good as ""Divorce italian style"".","A good film. Very good acting of the whole cast and very good cinematography, the white houses and the black dresses, etc., but a little too much overblown and overwritten. The ""message"" is sometimes not very subtle (the ""carabineri"" putting his hand over the map of Sicily an shaking his head, the nightmares of Sandrelli, etc.). Besides, there is no Mastroianni."
3,Sicilian Honor again,"This is a worthwhile movie for those interested in Sicilian culture. It shows the absurdity and barbarism of their social habits, or at least the way it was years ago. It's hard to sympathize with those backward morals. It reminds in a way of Divorce, Italian Style, and other movies made on the subject. It is an interesting movie."
2,Beautiful but unhelpful,"First off, a book about digital photography where almost none of the photos were taken witha digital camera? I wasn't very happy with that. It had some great photos, but didn't offer enough information about how I could take similar shots. It was just too general."
2,A pretty-looking coffee table type book,"I agree with the reviewer who was unhappy that a book called The Art of Digital Photography contains only photos taken with film. What's digital about this book? There are no helpful techniques suggested, digital or otherwise. This is more like a promotion for Adobe Photoshop & a plug for a few of the author's talented friends than anything else. Not recommended."
3,A transitional GG Allin album,"This album, originally released in 1984, was the beginning of what truly became the more demented part of GG's career. It is rumored that GG played many of the instruments on this release, either way, the playing is crude and production is horrible. ""F---- The Dog"" is a reworking of an earlier (and far better) Jabbers song ""Living Like an Animal"" and the rest of the album isn't any more tasteful! But of course, what else could you expect? GG Allin really created his niche with this album (independent of the Jabbers legacy). Sloppily played, crude punk rock with very juvenile, disgusting shock rock lyrics. But there was still elements of melody to be found, and this makes the music have a humorous quality that keeps one playing it, however much one feels like showering for a whole day after playing it!"
5,gg best album this and banned in boston,i wish they would make a cd with all of ggs early stuff like all the jabbers and scumfucs i guess rock n roll terrorist has most of it but not all of it you should get this cd and the banned in boston album you wont be dissapointed
2,Missing Their Captain,"Probably more like a 2 1/2 if that was an option. I pretty much agree with the last reviewer, although I am into a lot of countryish stuff too (but not so much the way these guys do it though). The best moments are the instrumentals from the first record; they are definitely the most Beefheartish thing these guys have in them. The vocal stuff is on the order of The Band and Little Feat, only the songwriting is no where near as strong as those groups.The second album was even sort of overproduced. All in all this is pretty much a confused mishmosh of progressive musicians that are unsure of what they want to do and in desperate need of some guidance. Not much that is memorable here. If you're expecting Beefheart-esque art rock you'll be thoroughly disappointed. At least I didn't have to buy this to find out what it was like;a friend lent me his vinyl copies."
2,"MALLARD = THE ""COUNTRY & WESTERN"" MAGIC BAND","Sorry to disagree with those reviewers who proceeded me, but I was partly guided by their reviews to buy this major disappointment. So much talent gone to waste. I am so surprised that these technically perfect musicians couldn't come up with anything better than these totally unimpressive, routine Country and Western sounding tunes.The Captain Beefheart ""sound-alike"" further detracts from the finished product in that his voice leaves you wanting for the genuine article. If you're going to start new band, find a vocalist that sounds new.From time to time there's something clever, but without someone who can really write music (like Captain Beefheart), even the most talented musicians sound ordinary."
1,>:(,"Rosters aren't that great, and it is impossible to hit homeruns with guys that normally hit around 10-15 in real life. It's completely bogus, go for mvp baseball. Barry Bonds is also not in mine, and A-rod is still a Ranger."
4,Skiffle 101,"I bought this CD because I buy every CD that Van Morrison releases. I have to admit that I was oblivious as to who Lonnie Donegan & Chris Barber were and what exactly ""skiffling"" was. I was quickly impressed with this CD (Van doesn't even appear right away). It's just good, clean, toe tappin', knee stompin' fun. Clearly, Van was enjoying getting back to his roots with a couple of masters of skiffle.I'm still not sure I'd know a skiffler if I bumped into one in a well-lit alley, but I can vouch for this CD being worthy of purchasing for any devoted Van fan."
2,NOT HIS BEST,"van morrison has some great live albums, but this one is not exciting. He was living out a childhood dream when he made this album. ""good night irene"" is the best song on the album. We must give him credit for bringing out a new album, even if it was recorded in 1998."
2,The Skiffle Sessions,"For Die Hard Van Morrison fans only! I am one, but was disappointed in this. Too much Lonnie and not enough Van. I listen to Van CDs in my car and play them over and over until the next one comes out. Skiffle is now back in the case and Back on Top plugged in again. Oh well..."
3,Another Interesting Diversion,"Remember that mountian family from the Andy Griffith show? The one where all the men played in a bluegrass band and Ernest T. Bass was in love with the daughter, Charlene? Well, take that band, throw in a dash of the Stray Cats, a shake of Waylon & Willie, put it all on Bourbon Street, and you've got the idea here. Lot's of fun, but probably not up your alley if you're looking for more of the Man's ballads of the 80's or his Celtic blues/soul/pop of the 90's. However, this collection is certainly more fun than his other recent diversions - improvisational jazz in ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"" and his contribution to the Mose Allison tribute ""Tell Me Something""."
2,Pretty awful guitar picks,I wanted a good thumb pick for fingerstyle playing and I agree with some of the other reviewers that these things feel like torture - way too snug fitting and I definitely wouldn't say I have massive thumbs. I think they will give some over time and use so not a complete loss. Overall though I think the quality of the pick isn't that great either so I will be looking for an alternative.
5,The Pick of the Picks!,"Very comfortable and ideal for switching from flat-picking to finger-picking. Plus they sound as good as many more expensive ""custom"" picks."
4,Photo shows four (4) picks. Description says three (3).,Good picks. I'd give it five stars except that the photo currently shows four picks and it's a three pack (as stated in the description/label).
1,these. are. horrible,"I don't even know what these other people got. They can't be talking about the picks I received. these are inconsistent, all heavy and the colors are from a 50's circus, but each is a different thickness, stiffness, and tonal character....they fit like low level torture devices, except for the one that just spins around and flies off every time you touch a string. The others nearly draw blood, leaves cut impression in your skin, the pick angle is just plain off, and the material sounds very marginal hitting strings. I can't say I like them as well as any other brand I've used; in fact much much worse. Get a dozen decent picks for the price of this garbage bag of 3."
5,I love this album,"I've always liked the first track on this album - Hungry For Rock. It is simple, but great. It's also hard to get your hands on if you live in England, not featuring on any of the Y&T compilations, and only available on import. So, I recently cracked and ordered it, despite the cost. When my CD arrived from Amazon I spent all day listening to it on repeat. I love it."
3,this sticker book is not very easy,I bought this sticker book for my 2 year old daughter ....its impossible for her to put them together .....its like a sticker puzzle ..
3,"Good, in-depth activities with room for improvement","I bought this for my 5yo son, and it is quite an in-depth book. The words have been familiar enough for him to read on his own, and the pictures are bright and compelling. Every section is broken up by type of object (ie: clothes, farm animal, food, etc), and they are further distinguished by color and by little numbers for each photo. This has helped my son choose the right sticker to match each ""puzzle""-like space, but I've already noticed some errors - mostly with more than one of a given number in an object type. I also think having the sticker pages perforated would be a huge help, so the kids matching stickers with words/puzzles don't have to continually flip back and forth between the thick pages. As it is, we've just ripped out the stickers page by page, but it's a messy process."
2,Never encountered so many printing errors!,"This book is pretty boring in the scheme of things. Never giving up on a book before it's ending, I was managing to drag myself through it, despite the numerous printing errors, spelling mistakes and omitted words or pages only to get to the end and find it not complete! Very disappointing. I've never come across a book with so many errors! I have recently read quite a few books on the Kennedy's and in my opinion""The Kennedy's - America's Emerald Kings"" by Thomas Maier is much better and a good in-depth read and without the mistakes."
4,astonishing number of typos and errors!,"The book is good, read what the others have said. I am simply astounded at the number of typos, mispellings, garbled sentences, and even incorrect names and dates on the ancestry charts. It's as if they were rushing to get into print and didn't bother to have it proofread, or even to run spell check!"
3,Take a Shower After Reading,"Collier and Horowitz are fine writers and thorough researchers. That said, this is an awful book. It tells a depressing, tragic and demoralizing story of a dysfunctional family that destroys its members and those that touch them. Why is America so fascinated with this family? Because JFK and his generation were beautiful and charismatic. What lurks beneath the veneer is disgusting. In the end, this book may perform a great national service. We may finally understand that the Kennedys and their faux idealism are to be pitied rather than emulated. The book makes the point early and often. Prospective readers should not waste any more time on this freakish family. Instead read David McCullough's ""Truman"" and learn why honesty, hard work, humility, honor and courage count for more than looks and a rich daddy."
4,Very good,"I really liked this accessory, it added weapons and equipment to the game that I feel need to be in there, becuase they're there in real life. One of the only things about it that bugs me is that some of the weapons are different calibur, yet still do the *exact* same damage (like the .38 & .32, I think a few others). Also, as another reviewer pointed out, gun enthusiasts like myself may be disappointed with the generic descriptions. I was. However, these shortcomings in now way detract from the value of this book, I recommend that anyone gamemastering a Dark*Matter game pick up this book."
1,Lenthy descriptions that never get to the point!,"I liked the previous 2 books in the Sybex MCSE series (and passed the exams with them). But this one by Paul Robichaux is just rubbish! Note that the first 3 chapters do not cover ANY Microsoft exam objectives - while it could have been an admirable intention to cover the foundations before the ""how-to's"", here it was very poorly done. The author gets carried away with lenthy analogies (sports cars, sedans, etc..., to the point of naming several makes and models of different types of CARS - are we still learning about networking computers???) When it comes to configuring the finer details, the discussion often ends with ""(do such and such)... unless circumstances dictate otherwise"". What are the circumstances that may rise? Believe me, it was not clear at all in the context (and these situation-based decisions are what we really need to know to pass the exam). In short, I find this book confusing and seldom to-the-point."
1,Inconsistent throughout,I read this book cover to cover and pass the exam. BUT not because of this terrible book. I had a TestOut CD-Rom...The wording of the author is strange and inconsistent. The CD-ROM were terrible horrendous. The author only appeared (in audio) in few example and the rest was a woman's voice. This woman doesn't know anything about computer period. This is most evident in her inappropriate pause of her speech. My advice to you the shopper DO NOT buy this book.
5,LOTS of great info...,"Paul Robichaux and James Chellis have done a great job with this book. There is a LOT of information here, and enough sample questions to pass exam twice over! You will definitely be prepared after reading this book and using the accompanying CD. I did notice that there weren't as many WinSim exercises as in the other MCSE Windows 2000 Study Guides, but to be honest this exam is more theoretical than hands-on. A definite recommendation."
2,"Sub-par, a real disappointment","I would recommend this book, but only with grave reservations -- don't use it as your only study material. I have been using Sybex's excellent study guides for years (all the way through my NT MCSE certification and now on Windows 2000), and this 70-216 study guide is definitely inferior. The material presented is handled well, but numerous omissions make it unreliable. The chapter tests are particularly atrocious. Questions are badly worded; several tests contain duplicate questions; there are numerous questions on material that is not covered at all in the book (e.g., WINS proxy, DNS round robin, DHCP database migration). I've come to expect far better from Sybex; this has been a major disappointment."
4,Pretty good,Used in conjunction with Exam Cram & Transcenders. Between those 3 sources I got enough ground covered to pass the exam.I think this would be an extremely difficult test to write a book for as it covers so much ground. I did find a few typos (in practice exam) and inconsistencies in the DNS chapter that were quite troubling though.I think the author did a good job taking an exceedingly dry topic and making it kind of fun to read. I have been happy with Sybex shtuff overall.
5,Passed the exam,"Using this book and the Virtul Lab they sell I was able to pass the exam. I also briefly looked through a friends' Transcender. This, though, was the toughest MCSE exam for me. Know DHCP, WINS, and DNS well. While it's true that the author gets a bit verbose at times, I, like several reviewers below, like the fact that such depth was given to the topics. The exam is hard and you need to work hard to pass it. Don't expect it to be a breeze. Anyhow, the book did the trick for me."
1,Sybex dropped the ball,"Please don't think you can pass this exam with this book alone. I used Sybex for my CCNA and passed with a 967, but they dropped the ball on this one. I knew every word of this book, cover to cover, and was shocked by the exam. You need situational knowledge to pass this test and Sybex doesn't deliver. The book is oddly arranged, going over broad details of services in the 1st 4 chapters and then re-visiting each one of them in the later chapters. This book also fails to cover subjects like IIS and SMNP. Finally, the exam practice tests are horrible and nothing like the actual test, (this is what was mainly revised in the 2nd addition). It might be a good reference book, but certainly not what your looking for to pass the test."
1,Insufficient,"The introduction declares this book isn't for you if you just want to pass the exam. This book is for people wishing to acquire a solid foundation in Windows 2000 network infrastructure. I thought to myself, great, just what I'm looking for! Unfortunately, I found it failed on both accounts. This book is not on the technical level readers will need to have a comprehensive understanding of this material. And if you're just looking for a test prep, find something else. You'll find yourself extremely under prepared.I've used many Sybex publications to prepare for certification exams and I usually find them helpful. This one was a disappointment."
3,Good Introduction,"The book is full of information but doesn't really prepare you for the exam. It may be a good thorough introductory piece but it doesn't cover the in-depth theory needed to pass the test. The test questions are the equivalent of a vocabulary test in Elementary school. They did absolutely nothing to assist with the exam.If self-study is your preferred method of study, this would be a good start but don't rely on it for the exam!"
1,Movie is about Hunting Moose and Deer,The title will confuse you. You think it's the TV show but it is not. There is no cover art and it's designed to confuse the shopper into buying a product they don't want. Be leary>
4,chapel hill rock 101,"So you know Archers. You know Polvo. You know Superchunk.Then why the ... don't you know Capsize 7? These guys were ripping up the CH scene at the same time as those stalwarts, and the rock was just as nasty. You might call this pop punk, if not for the thin sheen of ice that coats the riffs and vocals, and for the interesting twists and turns that the rhythms glide through. This album is wedgend between Archer's ""Vee Vee"" and Polvo's ""Cor-Crane Secret"" on my shelf, and plays like a hybrid of both. So cop it already."
3,Wordy,"I thought the background leading up to the actual crime was long, wordy, and not usually pertinent to the story. It took 11 chapters to get to the crime. It could have been an easier segue. I also thought there was a lot of ""fluff and stuff"" that had no bearing on the story. I have no problem with anyone professing their faith, but much in this book was overdone and, again, with no bearing on the book. Otherwise, Ivy Malone was delightful but some of her antics where unbelievable for a ""possum gray"" lady."
4,GOOD MYSTERY,"It was definately worth the read and is great for Christians or anyone else who enjoy reading ""G"" rated mysteries."
3,Could have done without the preaching,"Quick read. I thought the ending was a little unbelievable considering her age and I found myself quickly flipping the pages... I probably won't continue the series. Being of a similar age, I really wanted to love this but just thought it was okay."
5,Love it!!!,One of the best series I've read in a while. Love love love Ivy Malone. It's such a great mystery.
5,Poison Ivy,I sincerely enjoyed this book. I not only enjoyed the well written story but I loved how Lorena incorporated many admirable verses from the bible. This is a great book for Christians and mystery lovers alike. I recommend this book for all ages.
5,Keeps You Guessing,I 're as Lily enjoyed this gem. I feel in love with Ivy. The book keeps you guessing right up to the end.
4,A good easy read,I like the character and her everyday ways. It was not one that I could not put down but still entertaining and will next the next book in the series. The book is overall enjoyable and an easy read.
5,Mystery,This book starts out a little slow but boy does it get with it and makes you laugh and wonder. It's a very good mystery with a little clean love story combined. Excellent and I have reccomended it to a friend.
5,Refreshing cozy with a heroine LOL (Little Old Lady),"I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Ivy Malone and how she helped solve a mystery. Some sad things have happened in her life and she doesn't feel like anyone sees her, but she persists on following up on clues. Very clean and easy to read. I will be reading more of these books in the future"
4,Addictive!,Ivy Malone is a really cute personality. I wouldn't have thought that this book turns out to be so addictive- I couldn't put it down until I finished it cover to cover.
4,Surprisingly entertaining,"I was pleasantly surprised by the book. Ivy Malone is innocent and fearless at the same time. Moved along at a good pace, slightly predictable, but entertaining along the way. I will be reading the rest of the Ivy Malone series."
4,Invisible,I chose this book because it was free and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.I have never been a big mystery fan but have changed my opinion about that after reading this book. I have since purchased and read the next two in the series and am about to get the next one. I get easily bored with cookie cutter books that are predictable. This book had none of that. I couldn't put the book down and couldn't wait to get the next one started.
4,Good read.,I downloaded this book on my iPad. I am a 44 year old mom with two teens and so when I started reading and found out it was about an older woman who is widowed I almost put it down. Glad I didn't. I found myself almost in tears near the beginning. The main character was a little annoying at times but not in a way that made you want to put the book down. Overall. Just a good read. Nothing to dramatic. Makes you realize there is life after 60 :)
4,Surprisingly Good,"I took a chance with this book and was pleasantly surprised. Ivy and the supporting characters are truly likable. It was refreshingly 'clean'. It has a strong Christian-angle, which some readers might not appreciate. I did not mind it. Give it a try! I am looking forward to reading the sequels."
4,"Yes, it's Christian themed","As a LOL myself (""Little Old Lady""), and a Christian woman, I was thrilled to find a book where the protagonist shared my own values. I agree that it would have been wonderful to have known that the book was filled with religious overtones ahead of time, but the lady has spunk and vigor! She plows on solving her mystery with no fear (and, I fear, no common sense!). The book was light, engaging reading to take my mind off of the daily grind. I will read more by this author."
3,"OK read, interesting premise, execution could be better","I wanted to like this book. The premise was interesting. I enjoy Mrs. Pollifax, so I was willing to give an ""invisible"" older sleuth a try. I liked most of it, but I didn't really love it. My opinion: this book needed one more rewrite before it was published. The religion was a little heavy, but I can accept it as part of the character. It also made me think how I treated those who are older. My problem is, I hate books where I can see what the plot the twist is from very early in the book, but the main character can't. I don't regret reading it, but this is a book that if I had paid for, I would be donating to the library. I may read one of the other books in series to see if the author's style improves."
2,way too christian,I was annoyed by the frequent christian references that lent nothing to the story. It was a great premise and the characters likable but I was distracted from the story line whenever the bible verses and the christian messages were inserted. There was no reason for it. It does not aid character development or plot. I am a christian but this was over the top. The book is meant for a christian reader and should have been noted in the product description.
1,Boring,"I keep trying to get interested in this book, but it seems hopeless. It is boring. Nothing has happened in the first 1/4 of the book. I guess it gets better since some people gave it 5 stars, but I've already wasted too much time on this book."
1,Growing old has never seemed so scary,"Being an agatha christies fan when I read the synopsis I assumed this would be a miss marble like mystery...what I have found is anything but! It is seriously depressing and makes being a sectarian seem like something dreadful...all your friends are dead, spouse dead, no one noticing you because your old. Combine this with the fact it takes five chapters before you get into the remotest sense of a story line I do not recommend this book. And the religious undertones (or should I say OVERTONES) does not make for one of my favourite reads. I hope I never end up like Ivy!"
3,"Nice Mystery, But","I enjoyed the mystery part and the author must have gone through the invisible part, as most of us seniors feel that way. However, I do not like being preached to. If I had known how very christian this book was, I would not have read it and won't any in the future and that is a shame."
3,a little too much religion for me,"I enjoyed the mystery and would have read more of the Ivy Malone series, if they didn't keep hitting me over the head with religion. If you took the amount of religion out, Ivy would be a fun, interesting, older detective whom I would follow. If you're a religious type of person, go for it, you'll find the character delightful, if religion is not your thing, you'll find the book annoying."
5,Almost Perfect,"A great read. It's a quick read that's hard to put down. In fact, I liked it so much I purchased the second book in the series. The only issue is the religious references and pro-God messages come up a little too often. However, it is a great book nonetheless. But be warned: if the religion distracts or bothers you in this book, don't even go near the second book in the series."
4,Over Looking the Christianity...,"Besides the odd and random throwing ins of God, this was a good book. I really enjoyed it. It was easy for me to skip over the bible verses."
2,I'll Pass On The Rest By This Author,"I was happy to find a new mystery author who has a good writing style that I enjoyed. But as other reviewers have said here, the constant references to religion gets old pretty fast and turned me off. If I want to read about God in every chapter, I have a Bible. I pick up a mystery for entertainment, not Sunday School.I'll pass on the rest of this author's work."
3,"Good story, too preachy","I enjoyed the story until the preaching got to be too much for me. I have pretty much lost interest and don't think I will finish it. This slipped up on me, I didn't have a clue about the agenda when I bought the book."
3,Good Book,"I enjoyed this book I thought the characters were pretty funny and the story wasn't bad. My only complain was all the god references. If your into that then its fine but if your not it gets a bit annoying. Aside from that, overall I enjoyed the book but I wont pay five dollars to read the second."
3,Should come with a warning,"This story is overly religious. I was enjoying the mystery element, however I was getting sick of being preached at. As an Austalian, I have come to accept the high level of religion in US culture, particularly if reading books set in the Southern States. I don't mind the references to going to church if that is part of the story, but I just can't stomach all the god loves me stuff. I believe that religious books should be listed as such."
3,Cozy but preachy,"I like Christian fiction but this novel was too preachy for me. Still, the main character, an elderly widow, is pleasant and the plot is intriguing. It is a fast read and at points witty and amusing. But I think this book could use a warning label--if you don't want chat about comparative churches etc. you are unlikely to take to this book."
2,misleading,"The events in this story were fairly ridiculous. In addition, the book should have been listed as religious fiction. I have no problem with books that have strong, constant messages about God, but they are not what I would choose to read. If you want to read a feel-good God book about an old lady sleuth, then this might be the book for you."
2,too much religious content spoilt what couldve been a gr8 book,"i did enjoy reading most of this book but only by ignoring all the religious content. i found towards the end that it was almost like the author didnt know how to rap the mystery up because it became way too unbelievable and felt very disjointed. i will not be reading any more of this author, way too religious and judgemental for my liking."
4,Book,"I really got into the story line. I am now reading the 2nd in this series. The only thing I dislike is that her work is a little overboard regarding religion. I'm a very religious person myself, but I feel that it's just a little much in this case."
3,Can you see me???,"I was taken by the notion that a person can be in plain sight and still be invisible. This is part of the delightfulness of this mook. Ivy Malone, is a senior sluth, that decides to use her newly discovered gift of invisibilty to help solve the murder mystery of her neighbor's tenant. The characters are well written, even the characters that are locations and not persons are developed. Ivy is a go getter, you can easily seeing here getting on people's nerve, but they still smile as they help her out.It reminded me of a Miss Marple mystery, though there is a heavy Christian slant. It was still an enjoyable read. I understand this is part of a series. I am looking forward to reading more"
5,Murder she wrote?,"Fun, engaging and subtle touches of christian beliefs. This is a story that reminds me of tv show that was so popular, the grandma that secretly takes on a quest to solve a murder mystery. The plot is believable and so humorous that I just could not put it down! Not a dull page, chapter after chapter you are left wondering what will she get into next!"
3,She is not Miss Marple,"I tried to like this book, since I am the same age as Ivy Malone, but the story was not interesting. I can't imagine any elderly, invisible woman doing the things she tried to do. Miss Marple would think things through and then come up with the logical conclusion. Ivy Malone just rushed into evey ""adventure"" without any thought about who she could hurt. She managed to get almost everyone she met into some kine of trouble."
2,Did no one know how to properly investigate?,"For a free book, this is not a BAD read. But you absolutely must take it at face value for cheap entertainment. The numerous and sometimes forcibly placed religious references has been mentioned in some people's reviews, but no one has mentioned a complaint about the police force in this book.The entire 'plot' is based off the fact the police did ZERO comprehensive investigative work into this case and so it was left to the nosy old lady. Really? I can find at least 3 good spots where Ivy came up with evidence that really should've been looked in to, even if the detective in charge was rather dismissive. If they'd done any work whatsoever, this plot would've been nonexistent.I love free stuff, so this book got 2 stars, but I won't read the sequel."
5,Enticing,Ivy Malone dragged me along for the fun! Enjoyable story line with a few side steps that I am sure will pop up in the next book. I look forward to it.
5,Book Review Invisible (Ivy Malone series 1),Book Review Invisible (Ivy Malone series 1) by Lorena McCourtneyIvy is an older woman who feels she has been made invisible by her age as people marginalize her she's lost her best friend and she's at odds with what to do with her time Her dentist dental assistant mixes her up with other woman of a certain age. A man runs into her and says he didn't see her. So she decides to us her invisibility to her advantage and when someone is tearing down the cemetery headstones she goes to see for herself who is doing it so she can catch them in the act and finds out more of a mystery. Than her best friend dies and her tenant goes missing.A interesting strong woman Ivy is not a shrinking violet or old woman. Ivy investigates all starting this mystery. A truly enjoyable mystery that I'd like to read the next in the series. In Plain Sight5stars out of five
4,Mystery She Wrote comes alive.,"Good plot, leads automatically into sequel. Author did a good job creating believable characters. Interesting story development. Will read more of this aurhor."
4,Suprisingly good read,A good murder mystery that captivated me from Chapter 1 onwards. Some may be put off by the religious content but if you have some Christian faith then this is not over the top. I am eagerly awaiting the sequel.
5,Ivy reminded me of my mom!,I like Christian fiction mostly because I know I won't come across something smutty or off-color. I enjoyed the book and the main character reminded me of my 78 year old mother. The book addressed the struggles some elderly people have with a changing world and trying to fit in. The mystery was fun and kept me guessing. I will read the next one in the series.
2,"Naive, Christian, Not-so-Mysterious Mystery","If you are into very naive detective work where you solve the mystery way before the detective, then this could be for you. Add rose-colored glasses, STRONG Christian preaching, and a detective with no grit at all...then you will love this book. I read it just because it was my first Kindle book and more interested in the action of my Kindle. The price was right at $0."
4,LOL takes on a new meaning,"Ivy Malone describes herself as a LOL - little old lady. :0 She's quite cute and spunky kind of a busy body, but that's what makes the books so cute. It's a fun read, and if you don't mind the Christian preaching you can easily curl up and enjoy a good book."
4,Invisible,"This was a surprisingly delightful mystery. Great slightly quirky characters to enjoy and a steady pace, humor and nastiness mixed well with the suspense. I would recommend this and would enjoy reading any additional stories published. A good summer or by the lit fireplace kind of read."
4,Not rocket science - but if you are looking for a fun read - this is it,"this is the first Christian mystery that I have encountered. I appreciated the ethics of the character in the book and her values. Lighthearted mystery with a good plot, well written and amusing. A good read to relax with. I recommend it."
2,"The book was boring, for a much older audience",Started reading this book which was highly rated but free. The book is very slow and very boring. Perhaps a better read for people in their senior years.
3,Nice but not for me,"I am a Christian but this was a little over the top for me. She seemed to keep trying to force going to church and religion. If someone says, ""no, thank you!,"" we need to not push. I don't think the religious parts enhanced the book or the story. While I enjoyed the book plot for the most part, I won't buy another by this author or from this series bc of the mentioning of religion. Btw, I recently gave a poor review of a religious based book bc I felt it was way too casual and disrespectful, in my opinion, when referencing God and the bible, so please don't think I'm an anti Christian hater. I also think the description should state that it has a Christian theme, so buyers will be aware of that. In MY very humble opinion, some books should be religious and reverent but some others don't need to be when the topic or story has nothing to do with religion. Or at least state that they are, up front. When I bought this book the review did not mention a Christian theme."
3,Invisible by Lorena McCourtney,I enjoyed the story. It did have more religion reference than I expected. Parts of the story were predictable but it did have humor.
5,whitestar,I found Ivy Malone to be a unique LOL. She was very much like a lot of people I know. She could not let seeping dogs lie when she was really interested in the outcome.
3,CHRISTIAN COZY,"I was looking for a ""cozy mystery"", just quick & easy reading & since this featured a senior getting into action, I thought it'd be cute. Altho the story was OK, the preaching dragged down the story for me. I have no objections to preaching-IF that's what you're into but not for me. Just wish if they're so proud of the religious aspect, how about stating it clearly so each reader can have full info to make a choice. Seems that would be a better deal."
5,I got hooked on Ivy Malone-spunky sleuth,"I had never heard of this series before I bought the first book ""Invisible"". I was looking for some light reading for my vacation. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Invisible and in fact finished it before vacation and ordered the rest of the series. It is a special sleuth series from the eyes of spunky ""Ivy Malone"" of the gray haired set. She is talking first person throughout the book series. And seeing through her eyes the adventures she finds herself in is very entertaining. There are a couple of places in book three that seem to drag along but mostly I would find myself quickly reading on past those to find the intrigue in the book. The author is creative and I enjoyed all the mystery adventures. I would like to read more in the series."
4,Fun and kept me wanting to turn the pages,"I definitely enjoyed this mystery. I found myself staying up later than I should've, just so I could get to the next chapter of this bold little old lady's escapades. Humorous at times and downright dangerously stubborn at others, Ivy Malone is a lovable character with many unique facets to explore. Her thirst for solving crime is rivaled only by her steady faith in God, which is dabbled delicately throughout the story rather than hurdled at you in every chapter. Well done, in my opinion."
3,I'm really picky...,"I bought this because of the price, and I needed something to read. I know I am picky about my reading material, but I found this to be far-fetched and boring from the beginning. I won't be reading any more of this series."
4,Great little mystery!,"Nice change from the ""freebie"" murder mysteries I have downloaded lately. If you like the series ""Murder She Wrote"" you will love this book."
4,L O L with a big bump of curiosity!,"Invisible introduces Ivy Malone, the Little Old Lady (LOL), with a huge bump of curiosity. Ivy discovered she was becoming invisible. Probably caused by her age and demeanor, people would pass her by or ignore her presence and instead of this depressing her she decided to use it to her advantage.She cut into the middle of the tellers line at the bank and no one said a thing. The cemetery was being vandalized and since the Sheriff's Department said they didn't have the manpower to catch the vandals, the invisible Ivy decided she would stake out the cemetery and get the evidence so the police could act. This was the beginning of Ivy's sleuthing and satisfying her curiosity. The story keeps growing from here.This is a medium-paced, easy read, Christian faith mystery. I have already purchased others in this series, so look for future Ivy reviews."
3,"OK, but not a cliff hanger","Since I am well over the age of 50, I thought this might be an interesting departure from the usual murder mysteries I read. It was ok, but I didn't actually get the title until I was well into the book. I would, however, recommend it for a fun easy read."
4,Rentless pursuit to the truth,"I chose this book because i love a good mystery. I have never read this author before and didn't no if i would like a book about older people. Once i got into it, i new this was one extraordinary lady. It was exciting and well written. Couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the next book to continue this tale. Very good book."
4,Sweet LOL meets Magnum P.I.,Enjoyed this book and look forward to much more of Ivy! Didn't exspect this to be about an elderly woman but really enjoyed the book...I'm ready to start the next book!
4,"A Lovely, Fun, Lighthearted Mystery","Ivy Malone is not your regular detective. She is a spunky senior citizen who is out to solve the mysteries of her neighborhood. This is a delightful read with plenty of humor, and a pretty good mystery as well. Take a break, sit back and enjoy a fun romp with Ivy. She will put a smile on your face!"
3,Amusing,"Ivy Malone is a very amusing character. She's an elderly woman who accidentally becomes a sort of detective. I enjoyed her humor, but the story was a little bit boring."
5,lots of love for ivy malone',Ivy Malone shows that life is not over when social security begins or when we experience great loss. Ivy and those she crosses paths with are fully developed characters-some like Ivy with great faith and others who are struggling to understand and accept God. In her faith Ivy finds great courage and a determination to uncover the truth behind the mysterious deaths she stumbles upon. I've read each of these books and am hoping for more! Ivy's great fun.
4,Nicely written,"I'm enjoying ""Invisible"". The story is funny with some suspense. I really like the way the author makes me see the characters and settings."
4,great read!,"this is the first book in a series about ivy malone - a self proclaimed LOL (little old lady). ok, so i work in a nursing home and i have to say that ivy reminds me of a lot of my LOL's...she is a bit nosy (in a good way), she has a sense of adventure, and she can't help but share her love of her faith. whether you are religious or not this book is a great read. even if you don't think you would want to read a book about a church going LOL try it anyway. she is an endearing character and the story is full of mystery, suspense, and a little love. go ivy!!!"
4,Good mystery,I enjoyed reading this book. It moved quickly and had many different turns. I will definitely read another Ivy Malone book.
4,Great Book,"I loved this book,it was a quick read and the main character is awesome,i will read more in this series"
4,Easy read.,"Fun reading! Cute story, good giggles. I look forward to reading the rest of the series. Glad I came across it!"
4,Winter reading,"Good book to curl up under a quilt with while it snows and blows outside. I liked the Christian references -- good clean reading without being too pushy. Would be a good book for a REAL (Retired, Energetic, Awesome Ladies) Book Club."
2,"Interesting mystery, but...","The book started out well, and the mystery itself was good, but the book had way too many references to God, church, religion, etc. I didn't feel like a mystery novel was the place for this. In addition, the book ended so abruptly that I couldn't believe it was over. I looked on the subsequent pages to see if perhaps I missed something. It was obviously a ploy to get you to read the next book, which is not something I'm planning to do."
2,Not my style...,"I bought this book whilst searching for mystery series with funny, sexy female lead characters, with love interests thrown in here and there. Unfortunately there aren't too many of them around that are well written. This book wasn't what I was looking for. The action was a bit boring (what action there was...) and the main character just didn't click with me. Perhaps it's because I'm a younger audience, and someone in the Heroine's position might be able to relate easier, as she is an elderly woman. I didn't read to the end of this book, only the first few chapters, hoping the action and storyline would pick up, but after a while I gave up. I'm sure it's a great read for some people (obviously, reading the other reviews), but just not my thing."
4,Not your average LOL.,Ivy is a nosy Little Old Lady who wants to see justice done. I really enjoyed this first installment of the Ivy Malone series and am looking forward to the next one.
3,Good book for free,Entertaining enough to Keep reading. Nice to have a book without excessive swearing but a little too religious for my taste.
2,mildly amusing but way too lordy,"I downloaded this book because it was free and seemed interesting. It started out to be a light mystery with an appealing main character but it got itself all tangled up and messy in later chapters, as though the plot details had become a bit too much for the author.Also, I really didn't appreciate the heavy-handed religiousness of it all. It really seemed to me that the author wrote a nice enough book, but then decided to go back and slather the whole thing with gobs of god-sauce to appeal to a certain demographic.I don't particularly feel like rewarding that kind of disingenuousness in an author, so this is one of those mystery series whose further volumes will just remain a mystery to me."
2,Theme didn't play out,this would have been an ok book if the invisiblity thing had played out. But it didn't. So it was just a below average read.
1,You Get What You Pay For!,"I couldn't even manage to finish this lame book. Totally unbelievable plot and main character. Got really tired of having religion crammed down my throat. Not much else to say, but don't waste your time on this snoozer."
5,Great new protagonist!,I can't wait to read the next one! I feel as if Ivy Malone and I are related somehow. I loved this book.
5,Compelling and interesting recommend this if you have time to spare,Now this kept me reading and I didn't put it down till I finished so I would recommend this book
2,Got tired of it quickly,I put this down after slugging through about a third of the book. Just wasn't what I was looking for.
2,cute but too preachy,"I thought the book was cute. It was too dragged out and preachy. I just wanted to finish it as I do not like to leave a book unfinished. I agree with another reader be honest about the genre. It is I guess called ""Christian Literature."" I was turned off by the preachiness of the book and accepting Jesus into your life mantra."
4,A light hearted novel guaranteed to make you giggle,"A humorous book, so many little sayings that you could hear yourself saying at one time or another. a very good read"
5,Lost in a book...,I really love cozy mysteries...and this one was such a fun read. Love the invisible heroine...also enjoyed the Christian themes. Onward to the second in the series!
4,I liked it,"It's well written, and I identified with the heroine. The only thing I did not like is that it ends rather in the middle and book 2 is going to cost you $5."
4,funny and light,"This book was a light and entertaining story. I found myself chuckling aloud at several parts. I loved the light-hearted poke at becoming older and suddenly realizing it, and then finding very unique ways of making the best of it. The ""invisible"" part really rang true. There was frequent interweaving of Christian themes into the story. I had no problem with that,as I am a Christian, except it seemed a little disjointed. Some of it did not fit into the story as well as it could have. It was still a good read overall."
4,good mystery,Nice enjoyable read. Ivy is an older widow that feel like she is invisible because she old and short. Her friends die. she decides to find out out who is vandlizing cemetary even stays thier at nights waiting to find out. she cares for people and meets a lot of good friends. but she keeps trying to help find out who her neighbor really was and why she was using a different identy and who murdered her. Ivy takes a lot of risks. I look forward to reading another book about ivy.
3,"Liked character, object to preaching","Ivy is a very delightful woman, but I object when she starts preaching the gospel. I believe all religious themed books should be clearly labeled so secular people like me can avoid them."
2,Way Too Much Religion,Well written and a good read BUT a hugely distracting amount of born-again Christian preaching. If I were not Christian I probably would have stopped reading halfway through! As it was I thought it should be in some religious category in Amazon.
2,Preachy,"Not really a mystery book at all - the Ivy Malone character was amusing but it was hard to handle the overdone, simplistic religious messaging. It was a very, very light read in all respects.Review is by wife of Allan John"
1,would have been nice to have full genre disclosure..and so ho HUM,"Ok I was willing to skip past all the prayers, church going, and being oh so goody two shoes...but there was nothing much left. The story was boring and predictable and many places just stupid. The main character was so busy praying she was missing the obvious. I didn't finish it; I didn't even bother to skip to the end to see who the killer was and why they did it. I just wished he turned his attention on the main character, I might have liked it more...not much more, but more.Cost nothing because it is worth nothing. Please Amazon label your books correctly so the reader has a choice in whether they want to have religion shoved upon them."
3,Good yarn but heavy on the christianity,I'm a little offended at all the free CHRISTIAN books that Amazon makes available.I would like to see some equal time for other beliefs.Really...
2,could have been better,"I read the book and was put off by the ending and the endless prosyletizing. Even though the story had its moments, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,CLOL--Clever Little Old Lady,"This book was a very enjoyable read. A self-proclaimed LOL (Little Old Lady) bent with curiosity finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation. As a widow recently losing her best friend, our heroine Ivy decides to do some sleuthing in the funniest of ways, and her life definitely becomes more lively.I laughed out loud with this book, and I plan to read the next one. A good, clean, fun book that may especially resonate with a generation that seems to be invisible to today's youth."
4,Great Read for the Over 60 Bunch!,"I don't know how old the author is, but she definitely gets the ""invisible"" problem those of us over 60 face. And she weaves this problem into a nicely written detective story. While it's not a page turner - the author probably didn't want readers to hurt themselves if they had to hurtle through the pages - it's an enjoyable, funny book. The heroine, Ivy, gets involved in some interesting, if somewhat implausible, situations. But hey, that's why it's in the fiction category, right?"
4,The new Miss Marple,I originally chose it because it was free and was pleasantly surprised to find such a good storyline and entertaining characters. I will definitely check out the other titles in this series.
3,good read!,"Interesting, fun, good light read. I really enjoyed it and will be getting more from this author in the future. I recommend for a rainy day."
4,Fun read!,"What a fun read. This book was much better than I expected. It's fun to have a ""mature"" main character who is so spunky and daring. If you want a ""fun"" read, choose this book. It's what I classify as a good ""beach book."""
4,Invizible,"Was refreshing,fun and hard to put down. Not the usual who done it, and not full of sex. Just fun reading."
4,not bad!,"Its a free book, miss marple'ish, not as good, bit to much of the religion for my liking but not in a reall bad way, if there is another free book available I will read it too, as there were some real funny bits in it, however I think the auther of this book could have made the story line funnier and more mysterious as half way through the book I had figured it out already, but then that is what i read all the time maybe I am just to much of a mystery reader, spoiled it!!"
5,This one got me hooked,"This particular book got me interested in mysteries again! You'll meet Ivy Malone who is a widow that has lived in the same home, with the same next door neighbor for decades. But it seems that no matter where she is, trouble always finds her and she is bound and determine to figure out what to do to take care of it. If you like mysteries with some comedy stirred in and a package of suspense to boot, then Ivy and her adventures will take you along! This book is suitable for any age and I recommend it and the other Ivy Malone books without any reservation or complaint."
4,Cute read,"Ivy Malone is an LOL (little old lady) who discovers that she is invisible. Not in the literal sense, but people tend to see right through LOLs. This trait comes in very handy when Ivy decides to tackle crime in her town. She stakes out a cemetery, dusts her tomatoes, and takes on the bad guys!Invisible has some very cute characters in it and some very funny moments.Filled with wit and charm, (and maybe even a future love triangle) Invisible is definitely a cozy read for a fall or winter day."
4,A Nice Respite for cozy mystery lovers,"When I downloaded this book, I wasn't sure what to expect. What I found was a cozy mystery that felt a lot like the Southern Sisters series that has now ended with the death of the author. I cried; then I laughed until I cried. I can't wait for the next adventure."
3,was a freebie on amazon,I read this book as it was one of the freebies. It was an easy read and Ivy Malone is feisty :) I will probably purchase the other books in the series.
1,Too much religion!!!,what a crock! a good story spoilt by an over zealous religious diatribe that added nothing to the plot. reaffirmed my atheism. wont be reading any more of the series if the first on is indicative of the rest
2,Too much religion,"Easy read with likeable main character, but the religious references bothered me. She wanted to bring everyone to church with her."
3,lots of religious proselytizing,"I gave this three stars. For the average reader, it would be a two star book, because although it's interesting, fairly quickly there's constant religious proselytizing and holier than thou stuff. For the type of Christian who drives everyone in their vicinity nuts trying to convert them, it's a four star book.That's too bad, because there aren't that many contemporary mysteries out there with little old ladies as heroines. I was enjoying the book and found the heroine's religious attitudes appealing, until the author went off the deep end."
2,not recommended,"This writer is talented and main character is o.k., but way too much christian emphasis which makes an acceptable plot totally unbelievable. Everyone the main character meets, she asks where and if they attend church. Who in the real world asks everyone they meet if they go to church -- even casual acquaintances? Romantic interests even hinge on one of the couple going to church."
1,"Oh,my gosh","I have no idea why there was a 4 star rating for this book. It was difficult to get into, didn't hold my attention from the beginning. Only by sheer determination did I get through to the end. I kept thinking it had potential, but it let me down."
3,Just ok,Somewhat predictable. Several referenced to God and church. Felt a little like I was supposed to feel guilty if I wasn't a church goer.
3,Invisible,Very light and entertaining - a good book to read on a sleepy Sunday afternoon when you don't want to ponder too much. Cute and charming
2,"OK, but sneaky","It was free, but in order to finish the story, you have to pay for the rest of it. Sneaky. Well-written, but the plot moves v e r y slowly. I'll be able to live with not knowing the ending."
3,do not have this product,I did not receive this product so I cannot review it. I am not sure how it got onto my page.
1,Reminded me of the church I USED to attend,"I read this book all the way to the end, but that was because it was so ridiculous and badly written. It was like watching a train wreck. I am a Christian and downloaded this book (a freebie) knowing that it had a ""Christian Theme"". The author's notion of a ""Christian"" book seems to be one where the good guys go to church and the bad guys don't. I can assure you that there are many people who attend church (see title of this review) who are not close to being Christians. It's this sort of tone, in writing and real life, that gives Christians a bad name."
